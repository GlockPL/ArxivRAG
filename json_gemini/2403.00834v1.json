To truly make conceptual contributions, researchers need to be capable of understanding the AI-generated structures and extracting the underlying concepts and ideas. When algorithms provide little explanatory reasoning alongside the output, scientists have to reverse-engineer the fundamental insights behind proposals based solely on examples. This task can be challenging as the output is often highly complex and thus not immediately accessible to humans. In this work we show how transferring part of the analysis process into an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment can assist researchers in developing an understanding of AI-generated solutions. We demonstrate the usefulness of VR in finding interpretable configurations of abstract graphs, representing Quantum Optics experiments. Thereby, we can manually discover new generalizations of AI-discoveries as well as new understanding in experimental quantum optics. Furthermore, it allows us to customize the search space in an informed way as a human-in-the-loop to achieve significantly faster subsequent discovery iterations. As concrete examples, with this technology, we discover a new resource-efficient 3-dimensional entanglement swapping scheme, as well as a 3-dimensional 4-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-state analyzer. Our results show the potential of VR for increasing a human researcher's ability to derive knowledge from graph-based generative AI that, which is a common abstract data representation used in diverse fields of science.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Virtual Reality (VR) describes the full im- mersion of a human in a simulated environment, most commonly via the use of a Head Mounted Display, also known as a VR-Headset or VR- Glasses. Modern headsets feature stereoscopic rendering on top of the head and gaze tracking combined with gesture controls by tracking controllers in all spatial degrees of freedom. The applications of immersive technology are vast and varied [1], including but not limited to entertainment, education [2-4], industry and engineering [5-7], neuro- and medical sci- ence and therapy [8-13] and data science [14, 15].\nIn the natural sciences, VR is used to visualize and analyze complex, often three-dimensional (3D), scientific data, such as molecular or ma- terial data [16-20], microscopy data [21-24] or astronomical data [25-27]. VR is also used to better visualize neural network models [28-30] to address the challenge of making Artificial Intel- ligence (AI) explainable [31]. In addition, when the AI output is compatible with existing VR frameworks, it can be studied in an immersive environment such as reviewing drug candidates [32]. Beyond improved visualization, VR offers natural ways of interacting with scientific re- sults via intuitive gestures [33], which can be exploited, for example in interactive molecular simulations [34, 35]. Through this interactivity, the VR platform enables a variety of ingenious methods like using interactive simulations to sample data for machine learning tasks [36, 37] or even manipulating microscopic systems in real-time via in-VR-interaction [38].\nIn this work, we show that modern VR technology can be effectively applied to enhance the interpretability and conceptualization of scientific results discovered through AI. In particular, we study AI-discovered quantum optics experimental setups. By representing such experiments as abstract colored graphs [39-41], we can map complex setups into networks which in turn benefit greatly in legibility and interpretability when visualized n a true 3D environment [15]. We demonstrate the unlocked potential by showcasing (1) interpretable struc- tures in AI discoveries and (2) generalizations to new experiments derived from AI results by exploiting their graph geometry.\nTo this end, we built AriadneVR\u00b9, a webVR tool that allows us to visualize and edit experi- mental graphs as well as to dynamically compute their current state.

Among other tasks, AI is used to efficiently search vast configurational spaces to propose testable answers to research questions [44, 45], such as predicting protein folding patterns [46], developing drug candidates [47], designing new materials and molecules [48-51], quantum circuit design [52] or discovering experimental setups [53, 54].\nEven though solutions discovered in this way have value on their own, they might not generally provide scientific understanding if their discovery does not lead to new generalizable insights [55-57]. Achieving such an understanding can be very challenging when algorithms do not provide conceptual reasoning alongside the output. In such cases, the scientist has to deduce the fundamental ideas behind results from examples alone [57].\nDiscovery in Quantum Optics - In quan- tum optics, algorithms are used to efficiently discover new experiments.

In this representation, an experimental setup is encoded as a colored, weighted graph by identifying ver- tices as photon detectors and edges as correlated photon-pair sources [39-41]. An edge linking two vertices corresponds to the pair-photons propagating to the corresponding detectors. The complex edge weight encodes the amplitude and phase of the respective pair. This way, the weights also account for phase shifts and losses in optical elements like beam splitters and mirrors, as well as any occurring interference. The color of the edge is used to specify the internal photon mode, e.g. its polarization, path, spatial mode, time-bin, or frequency.\nExperimentally, quantum states are commonly obtained by relying on simultaneous detection events across all detectors, known as n-fold co- incidence detection. In the graph picture, such events correspond to subsets of edges containing each vertex exactly once, called perfect match- ings. As an example, a square graph decomposes into two perfect matchings:\n(1)\nOne such perfect matching corresponds to one term contributing to the final quantum state. The amplitude and phase associated with the term are computed as the product of all edge weights in the matching.

Here, we briefly introduce the quantum physical background of these experiments.\nGHZ-states and GHZ-analyzers GHZ- states are a class of highly entangled multi- particle states originally conceived as a 3-particle generalization of the well-known bell states [43]. Both classes of states form a multi-particle or- thogonal basis set, where each particle is maxi- mally entangled with all others. Since their orig- inal proposal, they have been generalized both to particle numbers larger than three and dimen- sions higher than two [64, 67, 69-71].

The tool runs fully locally in the headset's browser, requiring neither installation nor a tether to a computer for 3D rendering.\nFor preprocessing graphs, we use the igraph Python library [76] and its pre-implemented Kamada-Kawai-algorithm [77] to obtain a 3D-mapping of vertices. This creates an initial arrangement to be perfected manually in virtual reality.

The basis of all our VR analysis is the discovery and interpretation of structure in an experimental graph. We provide interactive 3D figures and basic VR environments for all graphs mentioned in this work at the accompanying website. Through manual sorting, the majority of PyTheus graphs can be transformed into visually clean structures, some of which are immediately interpretable, revealing information on how the respective graph achieves its task. If the mechanism underlying a graph is understood, we can manually generalize it to new experi- ments. This is done directly in VR by drawing new or extending existing graphs. However, in some cases the underlying structure is not immediately obvious, and it remains unclear how to generalize the graph. Here we can use VR to propose geometries of potential generalizations. We then use PyTheus to search for solutions to confirm or reject our candidates.\nFinding interpretable structures in 3D Graphs In the following, we show three selected examples from Ref.

Searching for such generalizations from scratch can be inefficient as the corresponding initial graphs, i.e. the search spaces, quickly increase in size. For example, the initial graph for 4-particle 2-dimensional GHZ-state generation has 24 edges. Searching for a 3-dimensional generalization more than doubles this amount to 54 edges, and attempting a 4-dimensional state without additional ancilla raises the size to 96 edges.\nWe can use AriadneVR to customize our search spaces and decrease the size of the initial graph to steer PyTheus to more efficiently discover desired solutions. We achieve this by analyzing existing solutions for lower graph sizes and defining candi- date geometries of extensions based on observed patterns. In Fig. 6 we show this process for the generalization of a 3-particle 3-dimensional to a 4- particle 3-dimensional GHZ-state analyzer. The 3-particle analyzer is highly symmetric. Our can- didate for a 4-particle geometry keeps this sym- metry and follows the same patterns observed in the smaller solution. By restricting the ini- tial graph to this geometry, the search for the 4- particle analyzer is reduced from 124 edges down"}, {"title": "Conclusion and Outlook", "content": "In this work, we presented ways to leverage the unique potential of immersive technology in the AI-driven discovery process for quantum op- tics experiments using PyTheus and our purpose- built VR-tool AriadneVR. By interactively ex- ploring the graph representations of quantum op- tics, a new approach to learning from AI to de- velop new experiments and insight is opened. Be- yond furthering the understanding of existing so- lutions for GHZ-state creation and measurement, we achieved substantial machine-inspired discov- eries with our tool. We engineered a new alterna- tive 4-pair 3-dimensional entanglement swapping setup, where one pair is created at no additional photon cost with knowledge derived from AI dis- coveries. We also showed the human-assisted AI discovery of a 4-particle 3-dimensional GHZ- state analyzer. To further exploit the potential of VR our prototype could be expanded to include multi-user support for cooperative analysis and direct access to PyTheus within VR. Addition- ally, a variety of potential visualization features and tools could be added to streamline the analy- sis process. Examples include computational op- erations on vertices as well as support for more post-selection conditions. Beyond PyTheus' dis- coveries, the methods developed here can poten- tially also prove useful in other AI-discovery fields where graph-based representations are used, such as in quantum computing (quantum circuits [52], especially ZX-graphs [78]), material or protein design (involving crystal structures and molecu- lar graphs [79]) and DNA-origami design [80, 81] in material science and biochemistry. We believe that enhancing human researchers' capabilities to comprehend complex data with technologies like VR is crucial to fully utilize the power of AI for scientific discovery.

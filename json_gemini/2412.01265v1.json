INTRODUCTION", "content": "Companies, governments, and investors need to predict economic trends to forecast revenue, product sales, commodity prices, and stock prices. The Diffusion Index\u00b9 is one of the indices related to economic trends; it is computed every month and provides information on economic trends during the prior period. The diffusion index is also used in corporate strategy formulation and is highly valuable.\nIn recent years, research on economic analysis using non-traditional data, such as satellite imagery, text data, and location information, has been increasing. Some studies use satellite imagery data to predict wheat harvests, while others employ text data to target uncertainties that were previously unaddressable. These studies have just begun and have not yet become entrenched in economic analysis.\nAmong non-traditional data, text, in particular, has been attracting attention. However, many studies that focus on large amounts of textprimarily involve counting the number of words included in a dictionary or using topic analysis methods such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Therefore, the novelty of analytical methods is not highly emphasized; rather, greater importance is placed on the subjects of analysis and the formulation of problem settings.\nThe text contains various information besides words and topics, and among these, we are focusing on causal relation-ships represented in sentence-structures. For example, in the sentence \"Due to the impact of rising prices, the number of overseas travelers is decreasing,\" the cause is \u201crising prices,\u201d and the effect is \"the number of overseas travelers is de-creasing.\" The causal relationships that appear in the text are those recognized by the person who wrote the text. Therefore, by collecting these causal relationships from the text and processing them appropriately, we believe it is possible to grasp the economy as perceived by the writer through these causal relationships. If we can extract causal relationships from text and employ an appropriate framework capable of economic analysis, it would provide valuable insights for new economic studies.\nPreviously, we proposed a framework focused on climate change, where we extracted causal relationships from news-paper articles to design a narrative index. In this paper, we design indices of economic fluctuation narratives derived from economic surveys. The contributions of this study are threefold. First, we demonstrate the versatility of a previously developed framework by adapting and applying it to a new dataset, the Keiki Watchers Survey, showcasing its generaliz-ability across different types of data. Second, we provide a novel perspective by extracting causal information from the judgment reasons and additional explanations in the Keiki Watchers Survey and analyzing their relationship with the Diffusion Index (DI). While existing research has focused on predicting current economic assessments in the survey, no prior studies have utilized causal information to explore how explanatory texts relate to the DI, making this analysis a fresh contribution. Third, we evaluate whether economic patterns, such as business cycles, can be effectively captured and interpreted using data from the Keiki Watchers Survey.\nTo this end, we constructed a narrative index to systemati-cally analyze and interpret the extracted causal information in relation to economic indicators."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "As related works of causal extraction, Inui et al. proposed a method for acquiring causal relations (cause, effect, precond and means) from a complex sentence containing a Japanese resultative connective \u305f\u3081(tame) [1]. Khoo et al. proposed a method for extracting cause-effect information from a news-paper text and a method for extracting causal knowledge from a medical database by applying patterns made by hand [2] [3].\nIn these researches, cause and effect etc. need to be contained together in the same sentence. These studies primarily focus on extracting causal relations within single sentences. Based on this foundation, our previous research constructed a framework that extracts causal relations from individual sentences and connects these relations across multiple sentences or topics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of causality. In the current study, we apply this framework to a different dataset, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in ana-lyzing economic textual data. As relevant studies on sentiment analysis for financial texts, Koppel et al. proposed a method for classifying news stories about a company according to its apparent impact on the performance of the company's stock [4]. In general, articles concerning business performance imply content that influences the stock price. However, even if a company's business performance is good, its stock price will not rise if its main cause is unrelated to its core business (e.g., profit from stock sales). The expressions are extracted manually in their research, and the method needs dictionaries.\nIn recent years, researchers in economics and finance have increasingly used BERT to analyze large volumes of textual data, such as corporate financial statements and patent in-formation, for tasks like text classification, information ex-traction, and financial data substantiation. In climate change-related analyses, Bingler et al. [5] extracted information on companies' progress in addressing climate change and assessed their scores, while K\u00f6lbel et al. [6] developed a sentiment index for physical and transition risks and conducted empirical research on its relationship with individual com-panies' CDS spreads. Thus, previous studies have leveraged extensive datasets to build classification models on climate change-related financial and economic topics, created news indicators and score ratings from texts, and analyzed stock returns, corporate behavior, and economic activity."}, {"title": "III. KEIKI WATCHERS SURVEY", "content": "One of the novelties of this research lies in applying the method proposed by Sakaji and Kaneda [7] to a different dataset and conducting experiments based on it. Specifically, the dataset used is the \u201cKeiki Watchers Survey\u00b2.\" This chapter provides a detailed explanation of this survey data.\nThe keiki Watchers Survey is a monthly questionnaire survey published by the Cabinet Office of Japan, aimed at grasping the current state and trends of the Japanese economy from various perspectives such as local residents, households, businesses, and employment. This survey is conducted in Japanese, where respondents evaluate the current month's economic conditions compared to the previous month on a five-point scale. Additionally, respondents provide their industry, the reasoning behind their assessment, and further explanations supporting that reasoning. The survey data is a valuable information source reflecting the respondents' actual voices, allowing for a detailed analysis of economic trends. In this study, we analyze survey data spanning from January 2011 to December 2023. We specifically extract three elements-judgment reasons, additional explanations, and response dates -as the foundation for our analysis. The additional explana-tions, in particular, contain detailed textual information related to the judgment reasons, positioning them as suitable data for in-depth analysis of the economic situation and for extracting causal relationships. These examples help illustrate the richness and depth of the survey data, which serve as the basis for our subsequent analysis."}, {"title": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "content": "Sakaji and Kaneda [7] proposed a framework for analyzing newspaper articles. In this framework, topics were predicted from the articles using BERT, while causal information was independently extracted from the same articles. The extracted causal relations were then used to construct narratives across topics, which were subsequently indexed to enable deeper analysis of the articles. In contrast, this study does not employ topic prediction. Instead, it adopts the \"judgment reasons\u201d provided in the Keiki Watchers Survey as pre-defined topics. This approach is reasonable because the judgment reasons are already categorized into 13 types (see Table II), eliminating ambiguity in topic setting. As a result, this method is expected to improve the accuracy of causal relationship extraction without the need for topic prediction.\nIn this chapter, we provide a detailed explanation of the pro-cess of extracting causal information, constructing narratives, and indexing them using the new dataset, the Keiki Watchers Survey. The overall process is illustrated in Figure 1."}, {"title": "A. Methodology for Extracting Economic Fluctuation Narratives", "content": "Building on the method proposed by Sakaji and Kaneda [7], we extracted Economic Fluctuation Narratives using the following steps. In Step 1, we performed causal extraction (left yellow arrow), followed by the extraction of economic fluctuation narratives in Step 2 (right yellow arrow).\n1) Step 1: Causal extraction was applied to the \"additional explanations\" section of the dataset while preserving the assigned topics. First, we determined whether the additional explanations contained causal relationships using the algorithm proposed by Sakaji and Masuyama [8]. Next, we extracted pairs of expressions representing the logical relationships between cause and effect, using the causal extraction method proposed by Sakaji et al. [9], and recorded them in a causal information database. Specifically, causal terms and resulting terms were extracted from sentences using keywords that indi-cate causal relationships, such as \u201cdue to,\u201d \u201cbecause of,\u201d \u201cas a result,\" \"therefore,\" and similar phrases. This entire process was executed using programs developed in the referenced studies, with no manual intervention.\n2) Step 2: Economic Fluctuation Narratives were extracted through Causal Chain Construction. By linking the causal information obtained in Step 1 with their respective topics, we organized sets of causal information that span across different topics. In this process, we combined causal information stored in the database between any two topics, allowing us to extract Economic Fluctuation Narratives a series of interconnected events that describe how economic factors influence one another over time. Specifically, these narratives assume a temporal relationship where past economic fluctuations affect current ones, allowing us to integrate past causal events with present effect events. This process aligns with the causal chain construction method proposed by Sakaji and Kaneda [7], as well as by Izumi et al. [10]. Figure 2 illustrates the linking process, where the Job Offer Movement is treated as the cause event and the Sales Volume Movement as the effect event. First, we calculated the cosine similarity between the causal expression corresponding to the current Sales Volume Move-ment (effect event) and the effect expression corresponding to the past Job Offer Movement (cause event) (blue line). If the cosine similarity for a pair exceeds the threshold of 0.5, they are linked. Finally, if a pair is linked, it is considered that a narrative exists between the topics to which the cause and effect events belong. In the example, the cosine similarity was 0.538, which was above the threshold, and since the cause event occurred before the effect event, it was determined that a narrative exists between the two expressions. The cosine similarity was calculated by vectorizing the causal and effect expressions using a Japanese BERT model.\nAs described by Sakaji and Kaneda [7], this corresponds to the assumption that:\n\u2022 A causal relationship \"If X, then Y\" exists in a survey on topic A.\n\u2022 A causal relationship \u201cIf Y', then Z\u201d exists in a later survey on topic B, conducted after the survey on topic"}, {"title": "B. Methodology for Indexing of Economic Fluctuation Narratives", "content": "Next, we explain the process of creating indices for eco-nomic fluctuation narratives that takes into account the causal relationships between topics (the purple section in Figure 1).\nThis method follows the approach proposed by Sakaji and Kaneda [7].\nIn the first phase, we indexed the \"Economic Fluctuation Narratives between two topics at different time points,\" as shown in Equation (1), and calculated a monthly index. \u03a4\u03bf avoid bias where more recent news tends to have stronger connections to past events, we gradually reduced the weight of older causal relationships over time. Specifically, we used a logistic function to model the decay, with the parameters $a$ and $b$ set based on the decay period of the news. In this study, we set $a = 0.02$ and $b = 0.065$, such that the weights halve after five years.\n$Monthly\\_Index(m) = \\frac{M(m) \\sum_{j=0}^{L(j)} \\frac{1}{1 + a e^{b \\Delta}}} {\\sum_{i=0}^{Cos(i_{t-d}, i_t)}}$ (1)\n$cos(i_{t-d}, i_t) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{i_{t-d}} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{i_t}}{\\|\\overrightarrow{i_{t-d}}\\| \\|\\overrightarrow{i_t}\\|}$ (2)\nHere,\n$M(m)$ : set of causal chains included in month m.\n$L(j)$ : set of cause event $i_{t-d}$ connected to result event $i_t$.\n$t-d$: observation point of the cause event leading to the result event.($d > 0$)\n$t$: observation point of the result event included in month m.\n$d$: time difference (in days) between the cause event and the result event.\nIn the second phase, we considered the causal relationships between any two different topics and specified the order of cause and effect events. This resulted in the aggregation of 156 time-series datasets, calculated as 13 topics \u00d7 12 topics = 156.\nWe refer to this as the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices."}, {"title": "V.

Experimental Results", "content": "To evaluate how well the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices tracks actual economic trends, we examined the cor-relation between the time-series data of each narrative's index and the time-series data of the diffusion index (DI). The DI, which measures economic conditions, is divided into three categories: Leading DI, Coincident DI, and Lagging DI, each serving to reflect different phases of the economy. The DI is calculated by comparing the values of selected series for a given month with their values three months earlier. An increase is indicated as \"+\", no change as \"0\", and a decrease as \"-\". For each category-Leading, Coincident, and Lagging DI-the percentage of expanding series (indicated by \"+\") relative to the total number of selected series is computed as the DI value, with series showing no change (indicated by \"0\") counted as 0.5. This method helps mitigate the effects of irregular fluctuations and captures trends similar to those shown by a three-month moving average. The number of selected series is 11 for the Leading DI, 10 for the Coincident DI, and 9 for the Lagging DI, totaling 30 series. Additionally, there are six types of DI in total, including the cumulative values for each category: Cumulative Leading DI, Cumulative Coincident DI,"}, {"title": "VI. DISCUSSION", "content": "The following points were derived from the correlation analysis between the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices and the DI conducted in the previous section.\n1): A comparison of Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows that, in this experiment, the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices have stronger correlations with the cumulative DI than with the regular DI. In Figure 4, which displays the heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients with the lagging DI, the highest value is 0.3. In contrast, Figure 3, which shows the heatmap for the cumulative lagging DI, has a peak value of 0.81. Additionally, by comparing the normalized time series data of the indices shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, it is clear that the cumulative lagging DI is more closely followed. This can be explained by the fact that the Keiki Watchers Survey examines changes relative to previous periods, leading to a stronger correlation with cumulative values.\n2): By comparing Figure 3 and Figure 5, we can see that the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices in this experiment have higher correlations with the cumulative lagging DI than with the cumulative coincident DI. Similarly, comparing the normalized time series data shown in Figure 6 and Figure 8 reveals that the cumulative lagging DI is more closely followed than the cumulative coincident DI. To reiterate, the coincident DI moves in step with economic trends and is typically used to assess the current state of the economy. In contrast, the lagging DI follows economic movements and is often used to identify turning points. These results suggest that the narratives in this experiment are more sensitive to detecting shifts in economic trends. Furthermore, given the nature of the Economy Watch-ers Survey, which tends to emphasize indicators related to household performance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and job openings, it is natural that the cumulative lagging DI exhibited the highest correlation, followed by the cumulative coincident DI. This result is noteworthy as it reflects how the survey's characteristics are mirrored in the experimental outcomes.\n3): Figure 3 shows that, for most causal events, narratives with customer traffic and sales volume movements as outcome events have particularly strong correlations with the DI. For example, in Figure 3, the narrative \u201ccustomer traffic \u2192 sales volume movement\" has the highest Pearson correlation of 0.81 with the cumulative lagging DI, followed by \"customer behavior \u2192 customer traffic movement\u201d and \u201corder and sales volume movement \u2192 customer traffic movement,\" both with a value of 0.80. This trend can also be observed in Figure5, which shows the heatmap of the Economic Fluctuation Narra-tive Index and the cumulative coincident DI. Examples of the causal chains from the three narratives mentioned above are listed in Table IV. These results indicate that the experiment successfully extracted common and predictable correlations, such as the direct connection between an increase in customer traffic and changes in sales volume. Additionally, it suggests that these movements are key topics in economic fluctuations.\""}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we analyzed Keiki Watchers Survey using our narrative framework. First, our framework extracted causality from the Keiki Watchers Survey. Then, our framework con-structed causal chains using extracted causality and Sentence-BERT. Finally, the Economic Fluctuation Narrative Indices were calculated using constructed causal chains. As an ex-periment results, we confirmed that our indices had strong correlations with cumulative coincident diffusion index. This is because the comments from economy watchers are describing fluctuations in the economy since the last time.\nIn future work, we have a plan to calculate the Granger causality of each narrative indices for analyzing leading and lagging. Additionally, we will tackle creating English narrative"}]}

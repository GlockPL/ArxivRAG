Therefore, detecting early signs of disease is essential for optimal plant health and productivity. Unfortunately, current methods for detecting leaf diseases are ineffective, and there is much room for improvement in this area. For example, existing techniques are typically slow and may require human intervention to identify possible disease symptoms. Deep learning methods have the potential to overcome these limitations and provide more accurate detection and identification of leaf diseases than traditional methods. However, many challenges still need to be overcome before these methods can be implemented in practice. In particular, researchers must develop resilient and precise deep learning models capable of accurately detecting and identifying different types of leaf diseases in large datasets of leaf images. The models should also be trained to perform well with images of varying quality and clarity, such as those captured under challenging environmental conditions or at different stages of a disease's development, these models should also be able to recognize and distinguish between similar diseases and other benign conditions. To address these challenges, we need to improve existing deep learning methodologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to generalize better across datasets and yield improved detection accuracy for various leaf diseases and conditions. In this study, our main topic is to devlop a new deep-learning approachs for plant leaf disease identification and detection using leaf image datasets. We also discussed the challenges facing current methods of leaf disease detection and how deep learning may be used to overcome these challenges and enhance the accuracy of disease detection. Therefore, we have proposed a novel method for the detection of various leaf diseases in crops, along with the identification and description of an efficient network architecture that encompasses hyperparameters and optimization methods. The effectiveness of different architectures was compared and evaluated to see the best architecture configuration and to create an effective model that can quickly detect leaf disease. In addition to the work done on pre-trained models, we proposed a new model based on CNN, which provides an efficient method for identifying and detecting plant leaf disease. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of our model and compared the results to those of some pre-trained state-of-the-art architectures. A parameter-tuning algorithm was developed to identify the optimal performance of each model. In this work, model building and testing will be carried out using open datasets from the literature as well as collected datasets for the plant that do not exist in the literature. In this work, we also discussed the effect of datasets on the effectiveness of deep learning models. The proposed leaf disease detection approaches were successfully implemented and evaluated, and very satisfactory performance results were obtained.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Agriculture, with its indispensable and central significance, plays a vital part in the economic progress of the nation. But Plant leaf diseases are a major concern in agriculture, as they can cause significant yield losses and decrease produce quality, making them a primary research focus. Despite significant advances in agricultural research in recent years, there is still much that we still need to learn about plant diseases and their causes, and plant disease detection which remains a major challenge. Furthermore, inspecting all the plants on a farm manually for signs of disease is both time-consuming and expensive. However, detecting plant leaf diseases is challenging due to the wide range of symptoms that different pathogens can have and the subtle differences in how these and other factors can impact the shape and size of leaves. Therefore, it is very important to accurately detect plant diseases for crop quality and quantity.\nUtilizing automatic techniques for detecting crop diseases is beneficial as it reduces the need for manual supervision, particularly in large production fields. One such technique is the employment of DL models for the detection of plant diseases. The automatic detection of leaf diseases is a significant research issue being pursued to benefit farmers because it is essential for early and rapid control of large fields of crops. Therefore, to solve this problem, in this study, we develop and implement an automated approach for the early identification of plant leaf diseases utilizing DL methods, which can identify different patterns in the images of plants leaf disease, and which shows great promise for increasing the accuracy of diagnostic procedures for plant diseases; using deep learning methods can easily automate the detection of leaf diseases and save both time and money. In addition, it would help to improve plant health management by detecting diseases as early as possible. Therefore, it is highly beneficial in the end to have various challenging projects because it contributes to the development of a system that can be easily maintained, improved, and expanded, especially as new models and algorithms are developed. As a result, this system will continue to be used as a tool for more accurate plant leaf disease detection, eventually addressing the complete set of image identification challenges.\nDeep learning techniques can be developed to recognize disease symptoms automatically in images of plant leaves. These techniques have the capability to extract complex features from images and make accurate predictions, even in the data's presence of noise and variability. Employing DL for the detection of plant leaf diseases can greatly enhance the speed and accuracy of leaf disease diagnosis, minimize the reliance on manual labor, and enable real-time monitoring of crops. However, there are also challenges associated with using deep learning for leaf disease identification. These challenges include the need for high-quality data for testing and training the models, the selection and optimization of deep learning model architectures and hyperparameters, and the interpretability and explainability of the models. Despite these challenges, deep learning methods have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in leaf disease detection, and and the advancement of these techniques holds the potential to revolutionize how plant diseases are detected and managed.\nFurthermore, several factors make detecting and identifying plant leaf disease difficult, including: (i) dataset images may be very closely related and thus have very similar diseases; (ii) environmental factors can influence plant leaf appearance; (iii) insufficient plant leaf datasets; (iv) image background; (v) symptom variations; and (vi) immature plant leaves do not always display apparent characteristics; they may differ in texture and color from mature plant leaves. Therefore, developing new models and algorithms will help us better understand fundamental leaf disease traits and the interactions that control these traits. It will also improve our ability to produce more efficient and accurate detection in other areas of image identification and the challenges they face. Developing new DL models to detect and identify leaf diseases will undoubtedly be challenging. However, it is an endeavor that could have substantial positive implications for both plant health and crop production, as it could provide us with the knowledge and insight necessary to make more informed decisions in the field of agriculture and allow us to develop more effective strategies for plant leaf disease prevention, identification, and management, ultimately leading to a more sustainable and productive agricultural industry. To enhance our capacity for efficient, correct, and reliable detection of leaf diseases, more research is necessary to develop DL models for their identification in the future.\nIn this study, we discussed the challenges facing current methods of leaf disease detection and how deep learning may be employed to overcome these challenges and enhance detection accuracy; we also studied existing methods extensively, and new alternative approaches have been proposed for plant disease identification using leaf image datasets, the proposed system provides an efficient method that includes a model that utilize advanced deep-learning methods to classify and detect leaf disease, we also presented a detailed study to determine the most efficient network architecture (hyperparameters and optimization methods) for model-setting architectures to get the ideal solution; we compared and evaluated the efficacy of various architectures until we found the best architecture configuration that allowed us to use a practical model that could detect leaf disease easily.\nIn reinforcement of the work done on the pre-trained models, we proposed a new CNN-based model that provides an efficient method for identifying and detecting plant leaf disease. The proposed approach is expected to help farmers solve their problems. We also presented all the processes for developing and implementing this new convolutional neural network (CNN) model for leaf disease identification in higher dimensional spaces. Then we fine-tuned our model by adjusting parameters like learning rate to ensure that our model performed similarly well on the dataset and was in the optimal solution. Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of our deep learning model and compared the results to those of some state-of-the-art architectur; Thisis is an important insight for soft applications, such as when the models deployed to be used in an agriculture environment. Finally, we extracted the features for the best detection by varying the number and properties of layers in the image. The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of determining the architecture of the best-performing model and the best training settings for these problems. The developed model was tested on a collected dataset of Brassica seeds using various evaluation measures. This method assisted us in identifying and implementing the best-performing architectures and training settings for predicting class labels. It enables us to tune the training model and find the best combination of architecture parameters, network topology, and weight settings for predicting class labels. Furthermore, the developed model can be applied to address other problems with similar characteristics.\nIn this work, we also created new datasets, collaborating closely with a specialist in agriculture for expert labeling and data curation. We recognize the pivotal role of high-quality datasets in the development of robust deep learning models. Thus, we explore the impact of datasets on the performance of these models by evaluating a single model trained on different datasets of leaf images. First, we used MobileNet, a deep learning architecture model focused on image classification and a mobile platform. Then we presented a comparative study of MobileNet architecture applied to these datasets to detect leaf disease. In this context, we also discussed some issues related to automating leaf disease detection employing a single MobileNet model architecture on various datasets and how the performance of one model can change depending on the dataset changes. We used three datasets to evaluate a single model, including unhealthy and healthy classes; for each dataset, all parameters had to be constant and identical; The model's implementation was assessed using a variety of criteria, including training accuracy, validation accuracy, and test accuracy. The effect of datasets on the effectiveness of deep learning models is essential in various applications. For instance, one of the benefits of effectively comparing different experiments is the ability to achieve high performance, more accessible retraining, and longer life. In all of these cases, there are two critical questions: first, is there a difference between the datasets, or are they similar, and second, if so, what is the performance that corresponds to these differences or the similar dataset, and which variables are responsible for each case? As a result, an accurate system is designed in this thesis to give a clear idea about these mentioned problems of leaf disease detection using a single model and different datasets; in addition to conducting detailed experiments that exhibit the impact of each dataset on the model's performance is important.\nMoreover, the existing studies on plant disease identification and classification predominantly concentrate on single-channel and same-resolution images, which may not be sufficient to capture the comprehensive information required for accurate disease detection. This thesis proposes a deep multi-scale convolutional neural network (DMCNN) framework for automatically classifying leaf diseases to address this limitation. The proposed approach utilizes multiple channels of information to enhance the precision and efficiency of disease classification. The DMCNN architecture comprises parallel streams of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at different scales, that are merged at the end to form a single output.\nThe suggested approach is evaluated on a tomato plant images dataset that contains 10 distinct classes of diseases and compared to various existing models. According to the research findings, the proposed DMCNN model demonstrates that the proposed DMCNN model outperforms other models regarding accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall. This study further demonstrates the potential of DL methods for automated classification of disease in agriculture, which can support early disease detection and prevent crop loss."}, {"title": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "In this chapter, the studies in the literature on the detection of leaf diseases are comprehensively reviewed.\n2.1 Studies on Classification of Leaf Diseases Using Deep Learning Methods\nIn recent years, there has been a significant increase in interest and dedicated efforts from scientists to automate the classification of plant leaf diseases utilizing image-based methods. However, despite these efforts, these diseases significantly threaten sustainable agriculture, leading to economic losses for farmers and the global economy, Moreover, despite the recent advancements in disease classification methodologies, there remains a significant need for a rigorous process involving a sizable team of experts to continuously monitor these diseases in their initial phases. This is because most current disease classification methods rely solely on visual observation by plant disease experts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that DL models using various approaches can effectively classify leaf diseases. Therefore, developing a robust disease classification system is crucial for efficiently and timely identifying leaf diseases.\nSeveral studies have been carried out focusing on the use of deep learning-based models to classify plant leaf diseases across various crop species. As an example, Brahimi et al. (2017) introduced a study that utilizes AlexNet and GoogLeNet as deep learning models to classify and visualize symptoms of tomato disease, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97.3% to 99.2%. Ahmad et al. (2020) presented a framework to identify plant diseases in another study. The method employed Directional Local Quinary Patterns (DLQP) to compute key points from the input image, followed by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify plant diseases based on the computed key points. Although this method improves disease recognition accuracy, further performance improvement can be achieved by incorporating shape and color-based information from the input sample. Furthermore, Picon et al. (2018) provided a method for agricultural disease identification in the wild, utilizing deep CNN for mobile capture devices. The system was highly effective in classifying trained datasets and repported an accuracy of 96%.\nAravind et al. (Aravind et al.,2018), proposed a research project that utilizes the AlexNet deep learning model to classify Grape diseases. The results indicated a 1.61% improvement in accuracy compared to AlexNet model, resulting in a classification accuracy rate of 97.62% for three specific diseases. In a similar study, Pantazi et al. (Pantazi et al., 2018) devised a methodology for categorizing plant diseases that incorporates the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. This approach offers a significant benefit in that it possesses exceptional generalization capabilities. However, its ability to classify samples accurately can be hampered by noisy data. Nonetheless, the system attained a commendable accuracy rate of 95%.\nLiang et al. (2019) conducted a study in which they compared the performance of the original Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with CNN combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the identification of rice diseases. The results showed that both methods performed similarly well, with CNN achieving an accuracy of 95.83% and CNN with SVM achieving 95.82%. In their research paper (Agarwal et al., 2020), they proposed a CNN-based architecture specifically designed for the classification of tomato diseases, the study is noteworthy for its computational efficiency and impressive accuracy rate of 91.2%. However, the model faces the challenge of overfitting when dealing with a limited number of classes. To address this issue, some researchers have opted to utilize CNN-based models, which have shown promise in overcoming this limitation. A study by (Richey et al., 2020) presented a novel method for classifying different types of maize crop diseases using a mobile application-based approach. The researchers employed a deep learning model called ResNet50, which exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities and achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99%. However, this approach's performance is constrained by mobile phone processing power and battery usage needs, rendering it feasible only for specific devices.\nIn a research publication by (Chouhan et al., 2021), the focus was on exploring innovative techniques for plant disease detection and classification. Their study specifically addressed the challenges related to the segmentation and classification of leaf diseases in Jatropha Curcas L. and Pongamia pinnata L. They proposed a cutting-edge approach that combined machine learning algorithms with advanced image processing techniques, achieving remarkable accuracy in disease segmentation. Additionally, (Chouhan et al., 2021) extended their research to another domain by introducing an automated method for the detection and classification of foliar galls in plant leaves. Their approach utilized an Internet of Things (IoT) based system integrated with fuzzy logic and neural networks to accurately identify and classify foliar galls. Furthermore, in a prior investigation (Chouhan et al., 2018), the authors devised an intelligent system for the identification and classification of bacterial diseases in plant leaves. Their approach employed a hybrid optimization algorithm coupled with a neural network, demonstrating effective computation and yielding valuable insights for disease diagnosis.\nIn (Sembiring et al., 2020), the authors provided a technique for classifying tomato plant diseases based on images of the leaves. They used a lightweight CNN for this purpose, the study was fast and accurate, with an accuaracy of 97.15%, but it was only tested for the identification of tomato leaf diseases and was not robust to other scenarios. In addition to the aforementioned studies, Barbedo presented a robotic system for plant diseases in (Barbedo, 2018), utilizing the GoogleNet model; this study tackled several factors and parameters affecting the network's performance with multiple crops, achieving an accuracy of 80.75%. In their notable publication (Shijie et al., 2017), Shijie et al. presented a pioneering study that aimed to classify ten tomato diseases using a combination of MSVM with VGG16. The study yielded impressive results, reporting an accuracy of 89% in disease classification. Additionally, the researchers achieved remarkable efficiency by training fine-tuned models within a reduced timeframe. Expanding on their objective to encompass various plant species, further investigations were carried out. Chen et al. introduced their project in (Chen et al., 2019), using a CNN model to recognize tea disease with an accuracy of 90.16%. Furthermore, Liu et al. presented their study in (Liu et al., 2017) by employing a CNN to determine apple diseases with an accuracy of 97.62%.\nThis section successfully reviewed, and reported the performance of various deep-learning approaches for plant disease classification.  presents an analysis of existing technique used for classifying plant leaf disease.\nUpon reviewing the literature analysis presented in Table 1, it becomes apparent that DL models encompassing diverse concepts have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various facets of plant leaf disease classification. These models range from traditional methods of leaf disease recognition to more recent techniques, including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning, and have demonstrated promising results for plant leaf disease classification. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct additional research to comprehensively assess the performance of deep learning models in various domains and gain a deeper understanding of their limitations. This will facilitate the improvement of accuracy in leaf disease recognition, particularly in the fields of plant leaf disease identification.\nThe implementation of deep learning in the detection of plant leaf diseases has the potential to revolutionize the current diagnosis of plant leaf diseases by providing more accurate and faster results, which would allow for better preventive measures to be taken, thus reducing the losses caused by leaf diseases in agriculture and the environment. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate deep learning methods for detecting plant leaf disease. In the upcoming section, we will delve into the studies documented in the literature that focus on plant leaf disease detection utilizing DL techniques.\n2.2 Studies on Detection of Leaf Diseases Using Deep Learning Methods\nThe continuous advancements in deep learning methods have brought about a revolution in the field of image recognition. This progress allows for highly accurate detection and identification of objects in images. As a result, DL approaches have now expanded their use to various agricultural and farming applications following their successful application in other domains. The integration of deep learning has ushered in a new era for agricultural applications, empowering them to proficiently discern and categorize various plant species, accurately identify and combat weed and disease infestations, optimize crop yields through data-driven insights, and open up avenues for countless other possibilities. In addition, the high level of accuracy provided by deep learning has allowed farmers to make more informed decisions with data, leading to better crop yields and higher profit margins while reducing the need for manual labor. Furthermore, deep learning technology has given farmers more control and accuracy over crop production.\nMany efforts and scientific studies have recently been introduced and implemented to solve crop disease identification problems to find an optimum solution that can help identify the infected leaf automatically. As a result, numerous approaches based on deep learning techniques have been suggested. For instance, A study for automatic and accurate leaf detection of diseases using deep learning approaches wree presented by (Muhammad et al., 2021). This study suggested using a deep learning model using EfficientNet and 18161 tomato leaf images to classify tomato diseases. They especially compared the performance of two models, U-net and Modified U-net, with 99.95% and 99.12%, respectively. The results showed that the Modified U-net model had better performance for leaf detection than the U-net model and achieved more accurate results for tomato leaf disease detection. For the same plant, In their publication (Liu et al., 2020), Liu et al. presented a study focused on the early detection of tomato gray spot disease. The study employed the MobileNetV2 model as its foundation. A high accuracy rate and quick detection speed characterize the proposed method, making it a viable solution for large-scale tomato field monitoring and demonstrating the potential of using deep learning techniques to detect tomato diseasesThe proposed method demonstrated a commendable detection accuracy of 93.24%.\nIn a study by Sahu et al. (2021), an approach for detecting, classifying, and visualizing bean leaf diseases was presented. The method discussed in this study was based on two deep learning models, GoogleNet and VGG16, to extract features automatically from images, and experimental results show that GoogleNet outperforms VGG16 with 95.31% accuracy. The authors in this work conclude that using GoogleNet is an efficient method for plant disease detection and visualization because of its high accuracy and quick training time. A study on the impacts of dataset size and interactions on the prediction accuracy of deep learning models was proposed by (Alexandre et al., 2021) research analyzes the ways in which training dataset measures and interactions impact the performance of those prediction models. The models produced successful results because they were trained on simulated datasets without interactions. However, the results become much more promising when the models are trained on datasets with interactions.\nIn a pioneering study by (Karthik et al., 2019), a novel approach was introduced to detect diseases on tomato leaves using deep residual networks. The researchers utilized the PlantVillage dataset, which consisted of 24,001 validation images and 95,999 training images representing three specific diseases. The experimental results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed network in leveraging CNN learning features at multiple processing stages, resulting in an impressive overall accuracy of 98%. Similarly, (Fuentes et al., 2022) proposed a deep-learning method for disease identification in tomato plant images captured by cameras with varying resolutions. The approach employed three CNN object detectors and a deep feature extractor, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In addition, data expansion techniques were employed to improve training accuracy and reduce false positives. Extensive testing on a diverse dataset of tomato diseases demonstrated the method's capability to successfully detect and classify nine diseases while effectively handling complex plant surroundings.\nIn a groundbreaking research conducted by (Ramachandran et al., 2019), a transfer-learning approach was applied to identify diseases types in cassava leaves. The authors went a step further by developing a smartphone-based CNN model for cassava disease identification, which achieved an impressive accuracy of 80.6%. Similarly, (Oyewola et al., 2021) employed a PCNN and DRNN to detect and classify five different cassava plant diseases. The study revealed that DRNN outperformed PCNN with a significant accuracy improvement of 9.25%. In another noteworthy study by (Rangarajan et al., 2020), a pre-trained VGG16 feature extractor and a multiclass SVM were utilized to classify various diseases in eggplant. The study focused on leveraging the power of deep learning techniques to accurately identify and differentiate between different types of diseases affecting eggplant plants. In addition, to estimate the performance of this study, diverse color spaces were used, including RGB, HSV, and YCbCr. This work showed that the combination of VGG16 and multiclass SVM can successfully detect eggplant diseases with an accuracy of up to 94.14%. Although this accuracy is promising, combining the VGG16 feature extractor and multiclass SVM could help detect other plant diseases with similar success.\nIn an original study conducted by (Sladojevic et al., 2016), a deep-learning architecture utilizing the Caffe DL framework was developed to detect and classify 13 different plant diseases. The CNN model showcased remarkable performance with an impressive accuracy rate of 96.3% in accurately identifying the diseases. In a separate research endeavor, (Geetharamani et al., 2019) presented a nine-layer CNN model specifically designed for the detection of plant diseases. The authors utilized the PlantVillage dataset and incorporated data augmentation techniques to enhance the size of the dataset for experimentation purposes.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation, they demonstrated that their proposed method outperformed traditional machine-learning approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the nine-layer CNN model in accurately detecting plant diseases was established through their experimental results. Furthermore, (Yang Li et al., 2020) employed a shallow CNN (SCNN) to identify diseases in leaves. The study involved extracting and classifying CNN features using SVM and RF classifiers. The SCNN model exhibited accurate detection results for all three types of diseases, highlighting its efficacy in disease identification across multiple crop species.\n(Mohanty et al., 2016) identified 26 plant diseases using AlexNet and GoogleNet CNN architectures. The researchers showed that both architectures achieved good accuracy, with AlexNet surpassing GoogleNet regarding the number of diseases accurately identified. With the help of several CNN architectures, (Ferentinos et al., 2019) could accurately identify 58 distinct plant diseases. They used real-time images to test the CNN architecture as part of their approach. The authors found that the CNN architectures could accurately identify and detect different plant diseases, with an average accuracy rate of 99.49% in AleXNetOWTBn and 99.53% in VGG. In (Adedoja et al., 2019), an accuracy rate of 93.82% was attained while detecting plant leaf diseases utilizing deep CNN architecture based on NASNet. Another deep-learning-based platform is suggested in (Ai et al., 2020) for detecting crop diseases and insect pests. The authors employed CNN as the underlying deep-learning engine to find 27 crop illnesses in China's difficult mountainous areas. Chinese farmers can efficiently utilize the system because it was designed with a Java applet as the user interface. A series of studies carried out by the authors revealed recognition accuracy of 86.1%. (Zeng et al., 2020) created a DL-based system for assessing the severity of the citrus disease. For training six DL models, including SqueezeNet-1.1, AlexNet, Inception-v3, DenseNet-169, VGG13, and ResNet-34, a dataset of 5406 pictures of infected citrus leaves was employed. In addition, the data augmentation techniques utilized to improve the amount of the training dataset in addition to the initial training dataset, which helped the models learn more effectively. In order to find which models are better suited to identifying the severity of citrus disease, the scientists analyzed the performance of these six models. Using the Inception-v3 model, the best detection was 92.60% based on the Mask Region model (He et al., 2017).\n(Jiang et al.,2019) suggested a technique for detecting apple leaf disease. The R-CNN DL model for object instance segmentation can identify items of interest in an image while producing a segmentation mask for each instance. A CNN model is trained to recognize common apple diseases utilizing a dataset including 2029 images of sick apple leaves. The identification accuracy was estimated to be 78.8%, taking into account the CNN model's very small training dataset. As seen in Table 2.2, which summarizes affiliated work on plant leaf disease label, several studies have been conducted to develop different approaches for the automated detection of leaf diseases employing images of leaves.\nUpon reviewing the literature analysis presented in Table 1, it becomes apparent that DL models encompassing diverse concepts have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across various facets of plant leaf disease classification. These models range from traditional methods of leaf disease recognition to more recent techniques, including convolutional neural networks and transfer learning, and have demonstrated promising results for plant leaf disease classification. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct additional research to comprehensively assess the performance of deep learning models in various domains and gain a deeper understanding of their limitations. This will facilitate the improvement of accuracy in leaf disease recognition, particularly in the fields of plant leaf disease identification.\nThe implementation of deep learning in the detection of plant leaf diseases has the potential to revolutionize the current diagnosis of plant leaf diseases by providing more accurate and faster results, which would allow for better preventive measures to be taken, thus reducing the losses caused by leaf diseases in agriculture and the environment. Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate deep learning methods for detecting plant leaf disease. In the upcoming section, we will delve into the studies documented in the literature that focus on plant leaf disease detection utilizing DL techniques."}, {"title": "3. THESIS PURPOSE AND CONTRIBUTION", "content": "In the realm of agriculture, timely detection of leaf diseases holds paramount importance in preventing crop losses and ensuring food security. However, traditional methods of leaf disease detection, such as visual inspection and laboratory analysis, can be laborious, subjective, and expensive. Moreover, these methods could not suitable for detecting diseases in large-scale farming operations.\nTo overcome these challenges, deep learning approaches have been used to create computer vision algorithms that can automatically detect leaf diseases from images of leaves. In addition, these algorithms can process large extensive data swiftly and accurately and learn to recognize patterns in the image's indicative of specific diseases. Overall, the integration of deep learning in leaf disease detection holds great potential for improving crop management and reducing crop losses. However, the development of more accurate and robust algorithms and the creation of more comprehensive datasets will be critical for further advancing this field.\nThis thesis aims to leverage deep learning techniques to create novel approaches and algorithms that can accurately and swiftly detect plant leaf diseases in real-time. We have presented our own work titled \"A Novel Convolution Neural Network-Based Approach for Plant Disease detection\" as an example of this approach. Our primary goal is to enable the detection of leaf diseases using real-time images, thereby improving the speed and ease of detection. Additionally, the research proposed in this thesis intends to assess and contrast the outcomes of this method with other prevailing techniques employed for the detection of plant diseases. By doing this, the accuracy of disease detection will be improved, making it easier for farmers and other agricultural stakeholders to take appropriate action when a disease is detected. As a result, the proposed research in this thesis will make an invaluable contribution to the realm of plant disease detection, which can lead to improved crop yield and greater agricultural productivity.\nIn this thesis, we thoroughly analyze the challenges faced by current methods of leaf disease detection and explore how DL techniques can overcome these challenges and improve disease detection accuracy. Therefore, we extensively explored and analyzed these aspects in our comprehensive study entitled \"Convolutional Neural Networks in Detection of Plant Leaf Diseases: A Review.\" We also conduct an extensive investigation of existing methods and propose novel alternative approaches using deep learning methods and leaf image datasets.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new approach called \"Plant Leaf Diseases Detection Using MobileNet Model\". The objective of this work is to develop an automated model capable of accurately classifying and identifying different types of diseases. To achieve this, the model utilizes MobileNet, leaf images, and an optimized network architecture. The anticipated outcome of this proposed method is to provide valuable assistance to farmers in effectively addressing their challenges. We also discussed the complete creation and implementation process for this new convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Then, by adjusting parameters, we fine-tuned our model to ensure it performed similarly well on the dataset and was in the optimal solution. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of our model and compared the outcomes with those of some state-of-the-art architectures to evaluate the feasibility of determining the architecture of the most satisfactory performing model and the most suitable training settings for these problems.\nThe current literature on plant disease detection and classification has primarily focused on one single-channel and same-resolution images, which may not fully capture the comprehensive information needed for precise disease detection. To solve this limitation, this thesis introduces a new approach called \"Deep Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks for Automated Classification of Multi-class Leaf Diseases (DMCNN)\". The proposed approach leverages multiple channels of information to enhance the efficiency of disease detection. The DMCNN architecture consists of parallel streams of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) operating at different scales, which are then merged at the final stage to produce a unified output.\nWhile there are numerous publicly available datasets on plant leaf diseases in the literature, there is a scarcity of datasets based on natural images. To address this gap, we have collected and prepared a novel dataset comprising common plant disease types that were previously absent in the literature. This dataset is expected to facilitate the research of scholars working in this field, enabling them to develop novel approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of plant diseases, validate existing approaches, and compare their accuracy and performance.\nFurthermore, the dataset was meticulously curated by capturing pictures of affected plants in diverse locations, under varying light and environmental conditions. This approach ensures a broader representation of numerous types of plant diseases, making the dataset suitable for developing algorithms that accurately detect and identify plant diseases. The availability of these datasets will not only benefit researchers and farmers but also contribute to global efforts toward sustainable agriculture. It holds the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of plant diseases, leading to improved crop yields, reduced pesticide usage, and ultimately, a more sustainable food production system. Moreover, the accessibility of this dataset will foster collaboration among researchers, promoting more comprehensive studies on plant diseases and their impact on agriculture. This collaborative environment will facilitate the development of pioneering solutions to overcome the challenges encountered by farmers, particularly in developing countries where food security is a significant concern.\nIn addition, this thesis attempted to explore the influence of of datasets on the implementation of deep learning models. To achieve this, we conducted an analysis using a single model trained on several datasets of leaf images. Through a comparative study titled \"Impact of Datasets on The Effectiveness of Mobilenet for Leaf Disease Detection,\" we sought to understand how different datasets influenced the performance of the model. This study took into consideration Multiple factors, including differences in accuracy and computation time across datasets, aiming to identify the factors contributing to these variations. Additionally, the comparative study evaluated the model's performance on datasets of varying sizes, quality, and complexity. Factors such as category distribution in the dataset, labeling quality, and image diversity were also considered.\nThe scope of this work will be expanded to encompass diverse deep-learning models, and their efficacy will be assessed for the accurate detection of other critical pathologies. The practical senses of this research can be readily extended to address detection challenges pertaining to other plant leaf diseases, as the insights gained from this work can serve as inspiration for similar visual recognition tasks. The outcomes obtained through this research have the potential to contribute to advancements in the field of plant health management and offer valuable insights for tackling similar detection problems in agriculture and beyond."}, {"title": "4. PLANT LEAF DISEASES ANALYSIS AND ITS SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS", "content": "Environmental change has made it more challenging to detect new plant leaf diseases. Therefore, identification of the variables affecting the emergence and increased incidence of these diseases is necessary. Furthermore, we list emerging symptoms and signs of plant leaf diseases and explain how they differ according to the environment. We also presnetd some traditional methods used to detect disease in plant. Here are some common bacterial, viral, and fungal plant leaf disease symptoms and signs.\n4.1 Bacterial Disease Symptoms and Signs\nThe symptoms of bacterial plant infection are similar to those of fungal plant disease. The disease is distinguished by minor, light green spots that appear water-splattered. The injuries increase and appear as dry, dead spots (Mattihalli et al., 2018). For example, bacterial leaf spots have darker or darker water-soaked areas on the foliage, occasionally with a light radiance, and are typically indistinguishable in the estimate. When the spots are dry, they have a spotted appearance. Eventually, the affected spots become large, grayish-brown areas on the leaves, with a center that may appear yellow or brown and a darker border around it. These spots can rapidly spread across the entire leaf surface, resulting in complete defoliation and potential damage to different parts of the leaf, such as young stems, fruits, and flowers.\nBacterial disease signs can be challenging to detect, including bacterial ooze, water-soaked lesions, and bacteria streaming in water from a cut stem. Furthermore, the affected leaf areas may initially appear as small, water-soaked spots, eventually expanding and taking on a more circular shape with a yellow-brown center and darker borders. The presence of these signs can be alarming. However, it is important to mention that not all of these symptoms are necessarily present in every bacterial disease. Thus, correctly diagnosing the symptoms is essential to choose an appropriate treatment. In Table 4.1, we present some typical diseases of several familiar plants. We chose rice, cucumber, tomato, and maize to describe the significant bacterial disease in these critical plants to provide an example of plants' important role in sustaining life.\nThe diseases highlighted in Table 4.1 represent the wide range of bacterial diseases that affect plants and the potentially devastating consequences they can have on food production and crop yields. Consequently, understanding the nature and dynamics of bacterial diseases in plants is essential for successfully managing and cultivating crops, especially the essential staples such as rice, cucumber, tomato, and maize, which are critical to human nutrition and food security. Furthermore, understanding these diseases can help inform agricultural research and development initiatives, which have been identified as critical strategies to enhance food production and improve crop yields sustainably. As a result, we must also comprehend the symptoms of other diseases, such as fungal and viral infections, to effectively prevent the spread of crop-related diseases and optimize agricultural productivity.\n4.2 Fungal Disease Symptoms and Signs\nFungi are among the"}]}

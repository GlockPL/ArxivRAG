INTRODUCTION", "content": "The human brain varies greatly in morphology, connectivity and organization [5, 6]. Brain atlases, mapping anatomically distinct and functionally specialized brain subregions, are fundamental for understanding complex brain function as well as precise diagnosis and treatments for brain diseases [8]. However, directly registering these group level atlases from standard coordinates to individual space based on morphological information often overlooks inter-subject differences in regional positions and topography, leading to inaccuracies in individual brain mapping and, therefore, fails to capture individual-specific characteristics and cannot guide personalized clinical applications at an individual level [3].\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique for measuring brain structure and function, and is essential for obtaining individual-specific brain mapping. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has been widely used in individualizing studies. rsfMRI captures the functional activity of the brain during resting states, and is proven to reflect the brain's functional organization [2, 14-18]. Other modalities such as diffusion MRI (dMRI) [4, 11, 19], structural MRI (sMRI) [22], and task-based functional MRI (tfMRI) [3] have also been investigated for individualization. Individual-specific parcellation was first proposed using region growing algorithm based on resting state functional connectivity in 2013 [14].\nSince then, various optimization-based approaches were later investigated, including clustering, template matching, graph partition, matrix decomposition and gradient-based methods, characterizing by directly determining individual parcels (i.e., regions) based on predefined assumptions [2, 14-17, 28, 29]. With the advances in neural networks and deep learning techniques, some methods automatedly learn the feature representation of each parcel from the training data, and obtain individual parcellation inferred from the trained model [3, 11, 18]. The individualization techniques have been successfully employed in the field of neuroscience and clinical medicine. For instance, they have been used for interpreting structural and functional variability of the brain and understanding individual-specific brain characteristics such as age [33], sex [36], cognitive behaviors [31], development and aging [33], genetic and environmental factors [38], and translational and comparative research [41]. Individual parcellation also plays a crucial role in identifying biomarkers for various neurological and psychiatric disorders [43-46]. Although individual brain parcellation could promote neuroscience research and personalized clinical solutions, and is a topic of great interest as demonstrated by the rapid development in this field, extensive literature is still limited. To our knowledge, the only published review focuses on precise navigated neuromodulation based on individual brain mapping [49]. Therefore, updated reviews are required to analyze and summarize the actual state of the art.\nIn this review, we present an overview of recent advances in neuroimaging-based individual brain parcellation, focusing on approaches in terms of optimization-based and learning-based methodologies, optimization objectives (i.e., prior assumptions), and data modalities. We then report on the most commonly adopted metrics for the evaluation of individual brain parcellation results, including intra-subject reliability, intra-parcel homogeneity, capacity of predicting personal characteristics and so on. We also review the progress in individual brain mapping linking brain function and behaviors, identification of biomarkers, precise targeting for neuromodulation and neurosurgery. The paper concludes with a discussion on future directions and open issues in the field of neuroimaging-based individual brain parcellation."}, {"title": "II. METHODOLOGIES FOR INDIVIDUAL BRAIN PARCELLATION", "content": "Individual brain parcellation is the process of determining the \"optimal\" assignment of each voxel or vertex in the brain to a parcel (i.e., region) under the guidance of individual information, such as rsfMRI timeseries, anatomical and functional connectivity, and morphological features. In this paper, \"individual\u201d is interchangeable with \"individualized\", \"individual-specific\" and \"personalized\". Brain parcellation refers to brain mapping, brain atlases, functional networks or functional regions across the whole brain or cortex in the present paper. The focus is primarily on individualization at the whole-brain/cortex level, and individual parcellation methods that specifically target a fraction of regions, such as the thalamus [53], hippocampus [54], and language areas [56], are not discussed in the present review. Methodologically, individual parcellation techniques can be classified into optimization-based and learning-based methods. Optimization-based methods directly obtain individual parcellations by optimizing predefined assumptions, while learning-based approaches infer individual regions by estimating a parametric model (i.e., mapping) that maps voxel/vertex-wise signals to subject-specific parcellations from data via a training process. Additionally, algorithms vary in terms of optimization objective functions, the use of single or multiple data modalities, and the consideration of single or groups of participants during the individualization procedures.\nOptimization-based methods\nOptimization-based individual brain parcellation methods allocate voxels/vertices into various parcels mainly based on assumptions that the signals of voxels/vertices within a parcel share similar characteristics. Some approaches also constrain the homology of parcels across subjects and the spatial continuity of each parcel. These assumptions/constraints can be either implicitly embedded within the algorithm or formulated by an explicit predefined objective function. Formally, optimization-based methods can be explained as an optimization process:\n$\\operatorname{argmin} f (\\{X_i, P_i\\}_{i=1}^N, P_0)$,\n\\{P_i\\}_{i=1}^N\nwhere $f()$ denotes the predefined objective function, $N$ denotes the number of subjects, $i$ denotes the index of a subject, $X_i$ denotes the individual-specific information, $P_i$ denotes individual parcellation, and $P_0$ denotes a reference parcellation if needed. Some optimization-based methods rely on personal information from a single participant ($N = 1$). In this case, some studies introduced reference parcellation $P_0$ to ensure inter-subject parcel homology by constraining the difference between the individualized and reference parcellation. Other studies take advantage of a group of participants to co-optimize objective functions to ensure the homology of parcels across subjects ($N > 1$). Empirically, the objective function $f(\u00b7)$ usually has a simple form, and thus it may not capture high-order and nonlinear correlations between the individual-specific information $X_i$ and the individual parcellation $P_i$. Indeed, the diverse functional complexity of the brain is likely linked to individual-specific characteristics in complex interrelations. We categorized optimization-based methods into six subgroups: clustering, region growing, template matching, graph partition, matrix decomposition, and gradient-based methods.\nClustering\nClustering is the task of grouping voxels/vertices that share similar characteristics, ensuring that voxels/vertices in the same parcel (i.e., cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other parcels. Clustering algorithms adhere to intra-parcel homogeneity and can be employed on single subjects using individual functional, anatomical, and morphological features. However, the direct application of clustering solely considers personal information and lacks regional correspondence at the population level, particularly for fine-scale brain parcellation, limiting comparative analysis across individuals. For example, N-cut clustering has been applied to a local connectivity matrix, which fused resting-state functional connectivity and anatomical connectivity between each voxel and its neighboring voxels, to obtain individual parcellations for single subjects [9, 10]. In addition, simple linear iterative clustering has been used to obtain individual parcellations based on combined functional-spatial distance, in which the spatial distance restricts the search space to the neighborhood of cluster centers [12]. Although both local connectivity and spatial distance ensure the spatial continuity of the parcellation, individuals are not comparable in terms of regional attributes due to the absence of homology. To address this issue, reference parcellations providing group-level prior regional knowledge have been introduced to guarantee inter-subject homology in the case of single-subject clustering [2, 4]. Reference parcellations effectively constrain the topographic similarity of the same brain region across individuals, making individual brain parcellation results more conducive to cross-subject comparative analysis. For instance, Yeo's functional networks with rsfMRI [2] and Brainnetome atlas with dMRI [4] have been used to guide individualization based on K-means clustering. The process involves initializing the individual parcellation using a morphologically aligned reference parcellation, iteratively reassigning vertices to parcels based on the highest correlation between vertex timeseries and parcel reference signals, and updating the reference signals until convergence.\nRegion growing\nRegion growing methods begin by selecting \"seed\" voxels/vertices as starting positions for labeling, and then iteratively expand these seeds by incorporating neighboring voxels based on similarity or distance metrics until the entire brain/cortex is assigned to distinct regions. This process implicitly optimizes the similarity of features within parcels. Notably, the selection of seeds is crucial for individualization, as they are determined at initialization and cannot be updated with iterations. Some studies have designated the geometric center of each parcel in a reference parcellation as seeds, and other vertices are gradually allocated to these seeds to constitute parcels based on the similarity of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the vertices and the parcels [27, 32]. By using unified seeds from a reference parcellation, these methods maintain the homology of the same parcel across subjects. However, if the center vertex of the parcel chosen as the seed is affected by more noise, the resulting individual parcel becomes less reliable. A more robust solution is to select seeds based on functional stability [14]. First, stability maps are calculated as the root mean square error between all timeseries in a 3 mm neighborhood ROI and the ROI's mean timeseries. Second, the local minima of the stability maps are identified as seed vertices. These seeds are then grown into patches, which are subsequently merged using hierarchical clustering to obtain the final individual parcellation. This approach has demonstrated high reproducibility within subjects, substantial overlap between individualized parcels and tfMRI-derived clusters, and clear RSFC transitions at parcel borders. However, this self-adaptive seed assignment method cannot generate homologous parcels across subjects.\nTemplate matching\nThe template matching method initially selects a reference parcellation as the template and then matches voxels/vertices (or patches) on individuals to the most \"similar\" template parcel. This optimal matching between individuals and the template implicitly ensures both intra-parcel signal homogeneity and inter-subject parcel homology. Gordon and colleagues have used a similarity metric based on RSFC [34, 35], in which the top 5% values of each vertex's vertex-wise RSFC were binarized and compared with those derived from Yeo's 17 group-level functional networks. Each vertex is matched with a template network based on the overlap rate of binarized RSFC maps, resulting in 17 individual functional networks. Using this approach, individual parcellations exhibited consistency in their topographic arrangement with the group average template, but also contained unique topographic features not present in the template. The similarity metric could also be based on the topography of regions [15]. Individual functional networks were first derived from K-means-based clustering [2]. Subsequently, each network was separated into spatially separated patches and matched with one of the 116 regions in a template that demonstrated the highest overlap. It was shown that individualized regions increased the statistical power of tfMRI analyses, and the functional connectivity among these regions better predicted fluid intelligence compared to group-level parcellation. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all regions in the template can be detected in each individual.\nGraph partition\nA graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, each connecting two nodes. It is applicable to both surface-based and voxel-based representations of the brain. The cortical surface mesh, composed of triangular vertices and edges, is a type of graph. In voxel-based representations, each voxel can be viewed as a node, with the neighborhood of voxels defined as edges. Therefore, the individual parcellation problem can be solved by graph partition algorithms such as Markov random field (MRF) and graph-cut. Specifically, MRF is a graph partition algorithm capable of setting priors between neighboring voxels (or vertices), making it suitable for optimizing assignment similarity between neighboring points to enhance spatial continuity [39, 42, 48]. MRF is suitable for both single and multiple subjects. For single-subject optimization, subject-specific graph-based parcellation with shape priors (sGraSP) was proposed to derive individual-specific functional parcellations by optimizing an energy function consisting of intra-parcel rsfMRI signal homogeneity, reference parcellation similarity, and parcel spatial continuity [39]. Nandakumar et al. developed a method to derive individual functional networks with brain lesions based on rsfMRI [42]. In this approach, the individual network is initialized using Yeo's functional networks, and the voxel labels are iteratively updated by maximizing the correlation between each voxel's timeseries and its network's average timeseries while ensuring spatial continuity using MRF prior. To jointly obtain individual parcellations for a group of subjects, group prior individual parcellation (GPIP) initializes the parcellation using a reference atlas and, during the iterative optimization process, considers the RSFC similarity between individuals as well as the spatial continuity of parcels [48]. GPIP-derived parcellations exhibit distinct individual differences across subjects, show improved functional homogeneity within parcels, reduced variation in functional connectivity across subjects, and consistent individual parcel boundaries with regions identified based on tfMRI.\nIn addition to MRF, the Infomap and graph-cut algorithms are commonly utilized. Infomap is a community detection algorithm based on random walks on graphs and has been employed to accurately map brain functional networks at the individual level [51]. The process involves computing vertex/voxel-wise RSFC for each participant, thresholding it to retain the most relevant connections (0.3% to 5%), and using these thresholded matrices as input for Infomap to independently determine community assignments. The identified communities are then matched to a group-level network template generated using Infomap from a group-average thresholded RSFC matrix. The individual network assignment is obtained by aggregating assignments across thresholds, assigning each vertex/voxel to the labeled network corresponding to the smallest threshold. Multimodal connectivity-based individual parcellation (MCIP) uses graph-cut to maximize an energy function that optimizes both rsfMRI-derived functional and dMRI-derived anatomical homogeneity within each parcel of a subject [41]. The energy function also constrains similarity between the individual and reference parcellation while maintaining spatial continuity within each parcel. MCIP demonstrates good test-retest reliability, anatomical and functional homogeneity, the ability to predict behavior, and heritability.\nMatrix decomposition\nMatrix decomposition is commonly used to determine functional networks by decomposing fMRI timeseries into functional network components and their corresponding timeseries, which is a way to enhance signal homogeneity within a network. Common individual-level decomposition methods, such as back-reconstruction [59], dual regression [60], and group information guided ICA [61], are built upon independent component analysis and project group-level independent components onto individuals. However, these methods generate functional networks with negative values, making it difficult to interpret the biological significance of these negative areas. Therefore, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to jointly optimize non-negative individual functional networks for a group of participants [17]. The proposed method enhances functional consistency within networks by non-negative decomposition, ensures similar spatial distributions of the same functional networks across individuals using a group sparsity regularization term, encourages spatial smoothness by a data locality regularization term, and prunes redundant networks using a parsimonious regularization term. It is worth noting that this method focuses on obtaining individual functional networks with continuous values (i.e., loadings), and to convert them into parcels, each point needs to be assigned to the network with the highest loading (winner-takes-all rule). The obtained subject-specific functional networks exhibit improved resting-state functional homogeneity and coherence in task-related activations. In addition to fMRI-based decomposition, Laplacian decomposition is used to compute joint embeddings for a dMRI and sMRI fused group-average and individual connectivity matrix [55]. The connectivity matrix is fused by dMRI-derived anatomical connectivity and sMRI-derived spatial connectivity using similarity network fusion. After obtaining joint embeddings, each vertex is assigned to the parcel according to the joint embeddings. In this method, Laplacian decomposition enhances anatomical homogeneity, and the joint embedding between individual and reference connectivity matrices ensures homology of parcels across subjects.\nGradient-based methods\nThe gradient of RSFC for each vertex measures the extent of RSFC change compared to its neighboring vertices, which can be used for individual parcellation [28, 29]. Initially, the gradient of RSFC for all vertices is calculated. The resulting gradient map delineates the boundaries of regions with drastic RSFC changes, and individual parcellation is subsequently segmented using the watershed algorithm. Metaphorically, regions with slow RSFC changes resemble valleys that gradually get submerged by rising floodwaters, while ridges with drastic RSFC changes are not flooded and are identified as the boundaries of parcels. This approach implicitly ensures homogeneity within parcels, as vertices with slowly changing RSFC are assigned to the same parcel, as well as spatial continuality. By employing this approach, a reproducible subject-specific parcellation is obtained for an individual, which corresponds to subject-specific task activations. Additionally, the individual-level parcellation exhibits distinct topographic features compared to the group-level parcellation, although they share broad similarities. However, this method cannot ensure homologous parcels across subjects."}, {"title": "B. Learning-based methods", "content": "Learning-based methods are characterized by estimating a mapping from individual-specific information to individual parcellation. These methods consist of two stages: training and inference. During the training stage, the learning model is constructed by minimizing a predefined loss function using individual features extracted from MRIs. At the inference stage, the trained model maps individual input features to individual parcellation. Formally, learning-based methods are expressed as:\n$\\operatorname{argmin} L(\\{X_i, P_i, G_i\\}_{i=1}^N)$,\n$\\,\\quad\\quad P_i = \\Phi_\\omega (X_i)$,\nwhere $\\omega$ denotes the model (i.e., mapping), $W$ denotes the parameters of the model, $L(\u00b7)$ denotes the loss function, $N$ denotes the number of subjects, $i$ denotes the index of a subject, $X_i$ denotes the individual-specific information, $P_i$ denotes individual parcellation, and $G_i$ denotes ground truth parcellation. Note that for some methods, $X_i$ or $G_i$ is optional in $L(\u00b7)$. In contrast to optimization-based methods, learning-based methods can capture nonlinear relationships between individual-specific information $X_i$ and individual parcellation $P_i$ via the estimated mapping $\\Phi_\\omega$. Because learning-based approaches generally require ground truth labels for model training, it is indispensable to determine the \"true\" individual parcellation as the ground truth $G_i$. However, a direct, accurate, and objective in vivo identification of whole-brain/cortex ground truth labels for individual regionalization is still lacking. Additionally, the brain is considered a hierarchical system, with various granularity in parcellation from fine-grained subregional specializations to the organization of functional networks having their own biological plausibility [62]. To our knowledge, three strategies have been employed to address the ground truth problem. Some studies directly employ a reference parcellation as ground truth [1, 3, 7, 11, 13], other studies use individual parcellation derived from other methods as ground truth [21, 22], while some studies introduce unsupervised strategies. For all learning-based methods, a well-established model needs to be trained using sufficient participants.\nVoxel/vertex-wise functional and anatomical connectivity derived from rsfMRI and dMRI results in high-dimensional data. To mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance, some learning-based methods extract features from functional networks [1, 3, 7, 21], parcel-wise functional connectivity [13], or tract-wise anatomical connectivity [11, 25] for dimensionality reduction. However, dimensional reduction may result in the loss of subtle information necessary for deriving individual-specific parcellations. Therefore, some models have attempted to deal with high-dimensional rsfMRI timeseries as input features, such as MS-HBM [16, 31], self-supervised CNN [18], and RefineNet [30].\nUsing reference parcellations as ground truth\nRegistering a reference parcellation from standard space to individual space provides a rough brain mapping at an individual level. However, the registration-based individual parcellation is a noisy ground truth, as a fraction of voxels/vertices in each region may not be correctly labeled. Therefore, the models should be robust enough to mitigate the effects of these mislabels. In practice, the models are either insensitive to the spatial position of the brain or supervised on constraints such as intra-parcel signal consistency and spatial continuity of parcels in addition to noisy ground truth.\nMultilayer perceptron (MLP) and graph convolutional network (GCN) can derive labels based on learning the majority feature distribution of each parcel, benefiting from the insensitivity to the spatial location of each voxel/vertex. Specifically, MLP is an artificial neural network that consists of fully connected neurons with nonlinear activation functions. Because of the shallow architecture, it has fewer parameters compared to deep networks [1, 3]. An individualization method used MLP to identify each voxel into one of the seven functional networks [1]. The voxel-wise RSFC features were dimensionally reduced using principal component analysis. This study selected voxels from a meta-analysis of task foci as the ground truth labels for training rather than using the entire group-level network as the ground truth to ensure that the selected voxels are accurately labeled. This multi-class classification on whole-brain voxels is challenging to extend to fine-grained parcellations because as the number of classes increases, the difficulty of the multi-class classification problem grows. In contrast, an MLP-based method proposed by Glasser et al. divided the multi-class classification task for all cortical parcels into multiple binary classification problems for each parcel [3]. The ground truth label for each MLP was set as the corresponding parcel in the reference parcellation. An MLP was trained for each parcel to determine if the vertex, which is within a 30 mm radius of the corresponding reference parcel, belonged to that parcel. For each vertex, features were extracted from sMRI, rsfMRI, and tfMRI, including myelination, cortical thickness, functional networks, task activation, and visuotopic maps. The binary classification results for each parcel were combined using the winner-takes-all rule, resulting in an individual parcellation of the entire cortex. The authors found that this approach delineates both typical and atypical parcel topography in individual subjects that cannot be identified by aligning group average parcellation with individual images using registration. This study suggests that different modalities provide complementary and essential information for individual parcellation, which is crucial for capturing topological deviations in individual subjects. A similar approach has been used on the marmoset cortex [7], while individual functional connectivity was used for training the MLPs instead of multimodal features.\nGCN is another position-insensitive model that has been utilized for individual parcellation, where the triangular mesh of the cortical surface is treated as a graph, and vertex-by-tract anatomical connectivity [11] or vertex-by-parcel functional connectivity [13] is treated as node features. For instance, a two-layer GCN with Chebyshev graph convolution named Brain Atlas Individualization Network (BAI-Net) has been proposed [11]. A confidence-weighted cross-entropy loss is used to encourage consistency between the individual and reference parcellation. The loss ensures that the central area of a parcel is more decisive for guiding the output individual parcellation, making the ground truth more robust. BAI-Net provided reliable parcellations across multiple sessions and scanners within subjects. The topography of BAI-Net-derived parcellations showed better test-retest reliability and stronger associations with both individual cognitive behaviors and genetics, compared to the K-means-based individualization method [4].\nUsing individual parcellations as ground truth\nGlasser's individual cortical parcellation [3] and MS-HBM-individualized parcellation [16] have been used as proxy ground truth to train individual parcellation models. A framework that integrates multiple geometric deep learning networks (gDL) has been proposed to obtain individual cortical parcellation with Glasser's individualized parcellation as proxy targets [21]. The model takes multimodal features derived from sMRI, rsfMRI, and tfMRI as input. The model leverages the vertex-to-vertex connections of gDL to improve the spatial continuity of the proxy targets. Similarly, by hypothesizing that individual functional parcellation can be inferred from more easily acquired sMRI (T1w and T2w), a spherical CNN is used to individualize functional networks from morphological features such as curvature, thickness, and myelination [22]. The ground truth functional networks of each subject were proxied by MS-HBM-individualized parcellation [31].\nIntroducing unsupervised constraints\nIn addition to relying solely on supervised ground truth, either reference or individual parcellations, some studies have included constraints, such as intra-parcel signal homogeneity and spatial continuity of parcels. For instance, the atlas individualizing with task contrasts synthesis (TS-AI) is proposed, which introduces intra-parcel homogeneity of multi-modal features, including rsfMRI-derived functional networks, dMRI-derived anatomical connectivity profiles, and task contrast maps [25]. TS-AI employs a two-stage pipeline based on spherical CNN. TS-AI first synthesizes task contrast maps for each individual by leveraging tract-wise anatomical connectivity and resting-state networks. These synthesized maps, along with feature maps of tract-wise anatomical connectivity and resting-state networks, are then fed into a U-net to obtain individual parcellation. By synthesizing task contrast maps, TS-AI does not require the existence of resource-intensive task fMRI scans during its application. The individualized parcellations produced by TS-AI were validated using various reference atlases and independent datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the method. In addition to intra-parcel homogeneity, spatial continuity is also constrained in some studies. RefineNet uses intra-parcel rsfMRI signal homogeneity by maximizing the similarity between each voxel and its corresponding parcel's timeseries and constrains the spatial continuity of parcels by allowing label propagation between neighboring voxels [30]. Notably, RefineNet can be integrated as a module into various neural network architectures for different downstream tasks, such as physiological index prediction, disease classification, and tumor segmentation. Furthermore, the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) combines intra-parcel RSFC homogeneity, the similarity between individual and reference parcellations, and spatial continuity [16, 31]. MS-HBM generates individual functional networks for multiple subjects by employing a hierarchical Bayesian model that considers multiple sessions of rsfMRI data. Recognizing that previous network mappings could potentially confuse intra-subject variability with inter-subject differences, MS-HBM hypothesizes that inter-parcel, intra-subject, and inter-subject RSFC follow von Mises-Fisher probability distribution, with the parameters estimated from the training data. Moreover, the topography of parcels derived by MS-HBM allows for the prediction of personal phenotypes encompassing cognition, personality, and emotion, which potentially serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.\nWithout constrained by ground truth parcellations, a self-supervised deep learning model has been proposed via a loss function comprising a data fitting term and a spatial sparsity term [18]. The data fitting term ensures intra-parcel signal homogeneity based on matrix decomposition, which aims to decompose the voxel-wise rsfMRI timeseries into several functional networks and their corresponding timeseries. The spatial sparsity term encourages overlapping between each functional network across individuals. This model first employs a set of temporally shared CNNs to extract temporal-invariant feature maps from the rsfMRI timeseries and then transforms the feature maps into individual functional networks using a U-Net architecture. The model, trained on healthy adults, demonstrated high intra-network homogeneity and prediction performance for new individuals from different datasets, including healthy individuals spanning various age ranges and patients with schizophrenia, indicating its good generalizability."}, {"title": "C. Optimization objectives", "content": "Both optimization-based and learning-based methods involve a quantitative criterion for finding an \"optimal\" parcellation. Optimization objectives (i.e. prior assumptions) usually include intra-parcel signal homogeneity, inter-subject parcel homology and spatial continuity, as shown in TABLE I and II. At least one objective should be included in the method for individual brain parcellation.\nIntra-parcel signal homogeneity\nIntra-parcel signal homogeneity suggests that the signals within a parcel should be more similar compared to those in other parcels. The signals vary across different methods, including functional timeseries or functional connectivity with rsfMRI, structural connectivity with dMRI, as well as morphology (e.g., curvature and thickness) and myelination with sMRI. Intra-parcel homogeneity can be implicitly achieved for region growing [14, 27, 32] and template matching [15, 34, 35] methods, in which each vertex/voxel/ROI is assigned to its most similar parcel/cluster within the algorithm to maintain intra-parcel homogeneity. Similarly, clustering [2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 26] and community detection [51] methods assign vertices/voxels with similar signals into a parcel, and gradient-based methods [28] assign slow-changing vertices in RSFC (i.e., vertices with similar RSFC) to the same parcel, implicitly satisfying intra-parcel homogeneity. In contrast, some graph partition [39, 41, 42] and some learning-based [16, 25, 30, 31] methods explicitly define intra-parcel homogeneity in the objective function, as the correlation or distance between the signal of each voxel and other voxels within the parcel. In addition, some clustering [20, 23, 24], self-supervised learning [18] and matrix decomposition [17] methods involve decomposing the voxel-wise signal matrix into a parcel-by-voxel membership matrix and a parcel-wise signal matrix [17, 18, 23, 24], which has been proven to be similar to grouping voxels with similar signals [63]. For learning-based methods, incorporating this assumption helps mitigate issues arising from the lack of ground truth individual parcellation, allowing the use of more complex deep networks in generating individual parcellations.\nInter-subject parcel homology\nInter-subject parcel homology suggests that individual parcellations across different subjects should share the same number of parcels and exhibit functional homology for corresponding parcels. This assumption can be achieved both with and without involving a reference (i.e., template) parcellation. For methods that involve a reference parcellation, a popular approach is to guide individual parcellations to be similar to the reference parcellation [1, 3, 11, 13, 16, 21, 22, 25, 31, 39, 41]. This approach ensures consistency in the number of parcels, and the sizes and positions of each parcel are relatively consistent across subjects, thus considered homologous. Some methods, such as template matching, region growing, and exemplar-based clustering, obtain homologous parcels by assigning each vertex/voxel to the most similar parcel in a template/reference parcellation [15, 26, 27, 32, 34, 35, 51, 55]. Other methods achieve this while simultaneously ensuring intra-parcel signal homogeneity by enhancing the similarity between the signal of each point and that of its reference parcel [2, 4]. Notably, some methods only initialize the individual parcellation to be a reference parcellation but do not involve the reference parcellation after initialization [30, 42].\nFor methods that do not involve a reference parcellation, they should incorporate multiple subjects. Homologous parcels can be obtained by confirming a common latent parcellation derived from multiple subjects and constraining the similarity between the latent parcellation and each individual parcellation [23, 24]. Moreover, it is also feasible to directly encourage individual parcellations of each subject to be similar to each other [17, 18, 20].\nSpatial continuity\nThe assumption of spatial continuity suggests that each parcel should be spatially connected, rather than consisting of several discrete patches or small points. This assumption can be achieved both explicitly and implicitly. A common explicit approach is to penalize spatially neighboring voxels (or connected vertices) assigned to different parcels. As a result, the boundary voxels/vertices tend to be fewer, ensuring the spatial continuity of parcels. This approach can be formulated by matrix multiplication [17], MRF [16, 31, 39, 42, 48], and graph-cut [41]. Moreover, sGraSP further explicitly defined a star-convex shape prior to ensure spatial continuity based on MRF by guaranteeing that any two vertices belonging to the same parcel can be connected [39]. Other methods encourage spatial continuity implicitly by clustering a local connectivity matrix whose connectivity is only between each voxel and its neighboring voxels [9, 10], by incorporating spatial distance into the distance measure to constrain the search space to the neighborhood of cluster centers [12], or by propagating labels between neighboring voxels for each iteration [30]."}, {"title": "D. Modality", "content": "Resting-state fMRI records the blood oxygen level-dependent signal, reflecting in-vivo functional activity with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution, and has proven effective in capturing individual functional organization. Compared to task fMRI, rsfMRI is easier to acquire since it only requires the subject to remain at rest during scanning. However, the reliability of measuring the correlation between two rsfMRI signals depends on the scanning time duration, with longer durations yielding more reliable measurements. Consequently, rsfMRI scans of varying durations may result in distinct individual parcellations for the same subject [28]. Moreover, the reliability varies across the cortex, with regions in the inferior temporal and orbitofrontal areas often displaying lower fMRI quality [64]. As a result, different parcels derived from rsfMRI-based individualization methods may exhibit varying levels of confidence in their correctness.\nSome methods incorporate dMRI-based fiber tractography to estimate whole-brain structural connectivity for individual subjects. Although structural connectivity tends to offer better reliability than functional connectivity derived from rsfMRI, a significant challenge is that fiber tractography is susceptible to false positive and false negative connections, potentially caused by gyral bias, unreliable pathway trajectories, and the underestimation of long-distance connections, etc. [65, 66]. Consequently, the derived tractographic weights only account for approximately 60% of the true fiber connections [65].\nCertain methods employ multiple modalities to achieve individual parcellation because integrating various modalities is believed to provide a more comprehensive description of brain function and structural organization compared to a single modality. Examples include combining dMRI and rsfMRI-based connectivity [9, 10], combining rsfMRI and sMRI [24], as well as combining sMRI, rsfMRI, and tfMRI [3]. The primary challenge lies in the intricate correlations between these modalities they share some common representations while also possessing modality-specific information. Existing methods have not thoroughly explored the relationships and complementarity between multiple modalities, nor have they deeply investigated how different modalities impact individual parcellation. Addressing how to fully exploit the rich individual information within each modality and integrate both consistent and distinctive information across modalities for individual parcellation remains an unexplored aspect in current research."}, {"title": "III. VALIDATING INDIVIDUAL PARCELLATION", "content": "As it is challenging to identify the ground truth parcellation in vivo, individual parcellation performance is commonly evaluated using indirect metrics such as intra-subject reliability and inter-subject similarity, intra-parcel homogeneity and inter-parcel heterogeneity, as well as correlation with personal characteristics. In addition, electrical cortical stimulation coherence, alignment with anatomical structures, simulation-based accuracy, etc., have also been used in accessing individual parcellations. Evaluation metrics in representative studies are listed in Supplementary Table. Publicly available datasets enable consistent and fair comparison across algorithms [18"}]}

It is desirable to allocate goods to those who truly need them, i.e., agents with high valuations. However, when tractable screening devices such as monetary transfers are unavailable, screening can be costly. For instance, while a first-come, first-served (FCFS) mechanism incentivizes high-value agents to arrive early and secure the goods, it significantly wastes effort. By contrast, a lottery-based mechanism prevents wasted effort but risks high-value agents not receiving the goods. To maximize social welfare (i.e., residual surplus, the sum of agents' payoffs from the allocation minus the sum of screening costs wasted), we must evaluate the tradeoff between allocative efficiency and screening costs.\nDespite its practical importance, the literature has not fully characterized an efficient screening mechanism, except for the environment with single-dimensional types representing the values for homogeneous goods (Hartline and Roughgarden, 2008). Many real-world problems involve multiple heterogeneous objects. The scheduling of vaccine appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic was a prominent example\u2014reservation slots, each of which specifies when, where, and which vac-cines will be administered, are highly heterogeneous goods, and potential recipients have diverse preferences over slots. In such an environment, each agent's effort level affects not only whether they can obtain a good (vaccine) but also which good (reservation slot) they can choose, influencing the performance of mechanisms. Given the possibility of another pandemic requiring the swift and efficient distribution of vaccines, a policy recommendation for this problem is highly demanded by society.\nIn this paper, we study efficient screening mechanisms for allocating heterogeneous objects. Agents have multi-dimensional types representing their values for each object, whereas they only have a unit demand. Agents can signal their values by making efforts as a form of payment. The central planner aims to choose the mechanism that maximizes residual surplus from a variety of options. A potential candidate is serial dictatorship with exogenous order (SD), under which agents sequentially select their most preferred goods from the remaining ones according to a predetermined order. SD is a no-screening mechanism in that agents cannot improve their allocations by paying the effort cost. Another candidate is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism (VCG), which induces full screening of agents' values to achieve allocative efficiency while incurring substantial screening costs. Besides these, the central planner has numerous options regarding the extent of screening costs to incur and how to allocate goods based on agents' revealed values. Characterization of efficient mechanisms for such a multi-dimensional environment is widely believed challenging because we cannot pin down the payment rule from an allocation rule and strategy-proofness using the revenue equivalence theorem (Myerson, 1981).\nThis study discovers a robust trend indicating that as the variety of goods increases, no-screening mechanisms such as SD tend to perform better. First, to explore the reasons behind this, we analyze a stylized environment that allows for analytical characterization.

We denote the total mass of objects by $m := \\sum_{k\\in K} m_k$.\nEach agent is specified by their valuation vector, $v = (v_k)_{k\\in K} \\in V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^K_+$, where $v_k$ denotes this agent's valuation for a type-k object. For notational simplicity, we omit the index specifying the agent's identity; thus, $v$ represents the valuation vector of a single agent, not their profile. Agents can choose the level of effort costs, and the central planner can observe it. Since efforts are used just like payments, we refer to them simply as \"payments\" in this paper, whereas we emphasize that all payments are burned without enriching the central planner as revenue. We assume that agents have a quasi-linear utility function. Accordingly, when this agent obtains object k with probability $x_k \\in [0, 1]$ for each k while making a payment of $p$, her payoff is\n$\\sum_{k\\in K} v_k x_k - p$.\nThroughout this section, we consider direct mechanisms that determine an allocation and pay-ment based only on the agent's own report and the distribution of the reported type profiles. This restriction has two effects. First, we can drop an index representing the agent's identity because an agent's identity does not alter the agent's outcome. Second, in a continuous market, there is no aggregate uncertainty, and thus if a mechanism satisfies an appropriate incentive compatibility condition, the distribution of reported types remains constant in equilibrium. Accordingly, we can also omit the other agents' type reports from arguments of the mechanism. A mechanism $M$ is comprised of an allocation rule $x : V \\rightarrow [0,1]^K$ and a payment rule $p : V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_+$, where $x(v)$ and $p(v)$ are the respective allocation and payment when the agent has a valuation $v$. Let $F : V \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ be the cumulative distribution function of agents' valuations.

That is, each valuation for object $k$, $v_k$, follows $G$ i.i.d. Throughout this paper, we assume that $G$ has full support and $G$ is twice continuously differentiable. The first and second-order derivative of $G$ is written as $g$ and $g'$, respectively. We further assume that all object types have the same capacity; i.e., we set $m_k = m/K$ for all objects $k \\in K$. We focus on the case of $m < 1$ to make the problem non-trivial. We refer to this environment as an i.i.d. environment.

Whereas it is not immediately clear whether ex post efficiency is also a necessary condition for the residual-surplus maximization, ex post efficiency, which guarantees no incentive to simply exchange objects allocated, is in itself a desirable property in practice. Therefore, we impose this condition as a constraint that mechanisms must satisfy, and leverage it in our theoretical analysis.\nTo achieve ex post efficiency, we should allocate objects in such a way that agents receive their favorite one whenever possible. In an i.i.d. environment, the scarcity of all objects is equal, and object-symmetry requires the mechanism to allocate objects in a symmetric manner. Accordingly, it is indeed feasible to assign every agent their favorite one whenever they are allocated. Consequently, under a mechanism that is both object-symmetric and ex post efficient, each agent faces only two possibilities: receiving their favorite objects or receiving nothing at all."}, {"title": "Mechanisms", "content": "In a continuous i.i.d. environment, if $M = (x,p)$ is object-symmetric and ex post efficient, then there exists $V' \\subset V$ such that $F(V') = 1$ and $x_k(v) > 0$ implies $v_k = \\max_{i\\in K} v_i$ for all $v \\in V'$.\nProofs are shown in Appendix A. Due to Theorem 1, since each agent can only obtain their favorite object, valuations for other objects can be disregarded. Thus, the problem can be reduced to a simpler environment with single-dimensional types. We denote each agent's valuation for the \"single object\" in the reduced environment as $v$, and let $G_K$ be its distribution. The value $v$ is defined as the largest order statistic of valuations in the original environment: $v := \\max_{k\\in K} v_k$.

Furthermore, the revenue equivalence theorem of Myerson (1981) shows that VCG is the unique direct mechanism for achieving allocative efficiency in single-dimensional environments.\nUnlike purely artificial mechanism designs such as auctions, direct mechanisms, including VCG, are not practically used in screening mechanisms utilizing ordeals. However, when indirect mech-anisms are employed, the resulting equilibrium allocations often coincide with those achieved by direct mechanisms. For example, FCFS is analogous to an all-pay auction in the sense that (i) those who exert more effort and arrive first obtain the goods, and (ii) the effort cost is incurred even if the good is not secured. In a single-dimensional environment, an all-pay auction has an equilibrium where the good is allocated to the mass m of agents with the highest value, and the expected payment in this equilibrium matches that of VCG.

If the supply $m$ is insufficient to allocate all agents with $w>w^{**}$, then only those with the highest values will win an item. Otherwise, an efficient mechanism first allocates goods with probability one to agents with values $w>w^{**}$.

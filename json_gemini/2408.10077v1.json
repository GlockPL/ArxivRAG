It is desirable to allocate goods to those who truly need them, i.e., agents with high\nvaluations. However, when tractable screening devices such as monetary transfers are unavailable,\nscreening can be costly. For instance, while a first-come, first-served (FCFS) mechanism incentivizes\nhigh-value agents to arrive early and secure the goods, it significantly wastes effort. By contrast, a\nlottery-based mechanism prevents wasted effort but risks high-value agents not receiving the goods.\nTo maximize social welfare (i.e., residual surplus, the sum of agents' payoffs from the allocation\nminus the sum of screening costs wasted), we must evaluate the tradeoff between allocative efficiency\nand screening costs.\nDespite its practical importance, the literature has not fully characterized an efficient screening\nmechanism, except for the environment with single-dimensional types representing the values for\nhomogeneous goods (Hartline and Roughgarden, 2008). Many real-world problems involve multiple\nheterogeneous objects. The scheduling of vaccine appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic\nwas a prominent example\u2014reservation slots, each of which specifies when, where, and which vac-\ncines will be administered, are highly heterogeneous goods, and potential recipients have diverse\npreferences over slots. In such an environment, each agent's effort level affects not only whether\nthey can obtain a good (vaccine) but also which good (reservation slot) they can choose, influencing\nthe performance of mechanisms. Given the possibility of another pandemic requiring the swift and\nefficient distribution of vaccines, a policy recommendation for this problem is highly demanded by\nsociety.\nIn this paper, we study efficient screening mechanisms for allocating heterogeneous objects.\nAgents have multi-dimensional types representing their values for each object, whereas they only\nhave a unit demand. Agents can signal their values by making efforts as a form of payment. The\ncentral planner aims to choose the mechanism that maximizes residual surplus from a variety of\noptions. A potential candidate is serial dictatorship with exogenous order (SD), under which agents\nsequentially select their most preferred goods from the remaining ones according to a predetermined\norder. SD is a no-screening mechanism in that agents cannot improve their allocations by paying the\neffort cost. Another candidate is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism (VCG), which induces full\nscreening of agents' values to achieve allocative efficiency while incurring substantial screening costs.\nBesides these, the central planner has numerous options regarding the extent of screening costs to\nincur and how to allocate goods based on agents' revealed values. Characterization of efficient\nmechanisms for such a multi-dimensional environment is widely believed challenging because we\ncannot pin down the payment rule from an allocation rule and strategy-proofness using the revenue\nequivalence theorem (Myerson, 1981).\nThis study discovers a robust trend indicating that as the variety of goods increases, no-screening\nmechanisms such as SD tend to perform better.

Therefore, we impose this condition as a constraint that mechanisms must satisfy, and\nleverage it in our theoretical analysis.\nTo achieve ex post efficiency, we should allocate objects in such a way that agents receive their\nfavorite one whenever possible. In an i.i.d. environment, the scarcity of all objects is equal, and\nobject-symmetry requires the mechanism to allocate objects in a symmetric manner.

In this paper, we present a desire-driven autonomy framework to guide a Large Language Model based (LLM-based) agent to simulate human-like daily activities. In contrast to previous agents, our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) operates on the principle of intrinsic desire, allowing it to propose and select tasks that fulfill its motivational framework autonomously. Inspired by the Theory of Needs, the motivational framework incorporates an understanding of human-like desires, such as the need for social interaction, personal fulfillment, and self-care. Utilizing a desire-driven task generation mechanism, the agent evaluates its current state and takes a sequence of activities aligned with its intrinsic motivations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) generates coherent, contextually relevant daily activities while exhibiting variability and adaptability similar to human behavior. A comparative analysis with other LLM-based frameworks demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances the rationality of the simulated activities.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The quest to create human-like autonomous agents (Wang et al., 2016; 2024b) has long been a prominent theme in artificial intelligence (AI) (Fetzer & Fetzer, 1990). A human-like autonomous intelligence is not simply a task executor; it can generate and execute tasks within a motivational framework aligned with its values and goals. Early pioneers such as Alan Turing laid the groundwork for evaluating intelligence through frameworks such as the Turing Test (Pinar Saygin et al., 2000), which posited that a key measure of an agent's intelligence is its ability to produce behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. Consistent with this perspective, we believe that generating controllable and reasonable human-like behavior is crucial to intelligence. Such capabilities can also enhance user engagement and trust in various applications of AI agents, from service-oriented intelligent assistants that foster realistic interactions (Vrba et al., 2014) to virtual agents in games that create immersive experiences (Hoogendoorn & Soumokil, 2010). Ultimately, the ability to generate human-like activity strengthens the functionality and legitimacy of AI agents in multiple contexts.\nThe development of large language models (LLMs) (Chang et al., 2024; Achiam et al., 2023) has generated considerable interest in LLM-based agents (Xi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024b), demonstrating their significant potential for achieving human-like intelligence. These models benefit from extensive training on diverse datasets, enabling them to possess a wide range of internal knowledge and reasoning abilities. Techniques such as task decomposition, reflection, and memory retrieval can be integrated to further improve agent execution success rates (Shen et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). As a result, LLM-based agents can perform well in diverse contexts and make informed decisions even without specific domain training. However, previous works focus primarily on fixed environments and measure agent performance on predetermined tasks without addressing activity generation (Song et al., 2023). While some approaches use external rewards in open environments to induce more human-like behavior (Sivamayil et al., 2023), the rewards are highly task-specific"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Human Daily Activities Simulation. The simulation of human daily activities has broad applications across multiple disciplines. It improves the understanding of decision-making processes in psychology (G\u00e4rling & Garvill, 1993), sheds light on social structures in sociology (Adler et al., 1987), and gives insights into market forecasting in economics (Makridakis et al., 2009). Abundant, high-quality human daily activity data is the cornerstone of such works (Korm\u00e1nyos & Pataki, 2013; Zhao et al., 2022). However, due to the high cost and privacy considerations of obtaining real-world data, the generation of reliable human-like daily activity has long been an interest in the field of artificial intelligence (Yuan et al., 2023). Alshammari et al. (2018) created a simulator software OpenSHS that can record the daily activities of a human participant within a virtual environment. Deep generative models have also been applied to generate human daily activity. GANs-like structure (Feng et al., 2020), VAEs (Long et al., 2023), and diffusion models (Zhu et al., 2023) have been customized to generate human activity trajectories. However, less work has focused on harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) to simulate human daily activities. Wang et al. (2023b) proposed Humanoid Agents, a platform for human-like simulations of Generative Agents. However, this platform only supports fixed environmental settings and a single backbone language model with limited agent types, restricting its application in research settings. Additionally, (Park et al., 2023) propose generative agents that autonomously plan, act, and reflect in a sandbox environment, showcasing believable human-like behaviors driven by memory synthesis and social interactions. (Colas et al., 2023) introduce a language-model-augmented autotelic agent (LMA3) that dynamically generates and reshapes abstract goals to enable open-ended skill learning in task-agnostic environments. Our work contributes to the field by developing a flexible human daily activity simulator that can support different agent types and dynamic environments, providing a robust platform for simulating human-like activities. Building on this simulator, we propose a desire-driven autonomous framework to generate more realistic and coherent sequences of human daily activities.\nLLM-based Agents. LLM-based agents (Wang et al., 2024b) have become a thriving area of research due to the impressive problem-solving capabilities of large language models in diverse domains. These agents leverage the extensive training data and internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to perform tasks in dynamic environments with minimal task-specific fine-tuning. Many existing works focus on goal-driven behaviors, where the agents are designed to decompose user-defined tasks into simpler subtasks and solve them sequentially. For example, systems such as BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), AutoGPT (Significant Gravitas, 2023), and Voyager (Wang et al., 2023a) create recursive frameworks for agents to autonomously decompose tasks and execute them in a structured, stepwise manner. These task-oriented agents prioritize the efficient achievement of user-defined goals and rely on external rewards or instructions to guide their actions. However, task-oriented approaches often overlook the importance of intrinsic motivation, a critical aspect of human-like behavior. Some research, such as that by Liu et al. (2023), incorporates long-term memory to improve task coherence across interactions but remains goal-oriented. Other efforts, such as Langchain Agents (Chase, 2022) and CAMEL (Li et al., 2023), enhance the ability of agents to follow instructions and manage task decomposition but do not focus on simulating behaviors that arise from human-like desires or needs. Our research departs from these approaches by focusing on desire-driven autonomy. While most LLM-based agents depend on predefined goals, our framework allows agents to autonomously generate tasks based on a motivational system inspired by Theory of Needs. This shift from external reward-driven behavior to intrinsic desire-based behavior enables agents to simulate more natural, coherent, and human-like daily activities. By aligning agent actions with intrinsic motivations rather than task-specific instructions, we provide a new paradigm for LLM-based agents that fosters more flexible and adaptive behavior in diverse real-world scenarios."}, {"title": "3 PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "In this work, we focus on the problem of simulating human-like daily activities in indoor environments without explicit task instructions. The environment description is denoted by $e$, and the agent profile $p$ includes details such as name, age, and relevant characteristics of the simulated human. For different types of agents, the simulator provides additional customized information $I$ to specify their objectives. For instance, instruction-following agents receive a general goal instruction $g$, while desire-driven agents are assigned desire values $d$. The simulation process consists of $T$ time"}, {"title": "4 HUMAN-LIKE DAILY ACTIVITIES SIMULATOR", "content": "Our simulator is built on Concordia (Vezhnevets et al., 2023), a text-based simulator empowered by large language models. The Concordia library equips our simulator with a rich set of components, each serving specific roles such as goal and plan management, time reporting, memory storage, retrieval, and more. It also provides wrapped interfaces that support various open-source models and APIs, allowing the simulator to switch between different underlying models. These components form the core of Concordia's interaction framework, enabling flexible communication between the agent and the Game Master, which is the environment controller.\nBuilding on this agent-controller framework, we introduce several enhancements designed for human-like daily activity simulation. First, environment consistency is enforced through explicit procedures and prompts, ensuring agents only interact with items present in the environment, thus maintaining realism. This consistency enables the dynamic addition or removal of interactable items within text-based environments, allowing precise control over the agent's activity space. Second, our simulator supports self-reflection during both action execution and state updates, improving decision-making and reliability. Finally, we provide robust methods for evaluation and visualization, enabling the assessment of both single-step actions and entire activity sequences for coherence and plausibility. These custom modifications facilitate human-like daily activity simulations, ensuring adaptability, stability, and reliability across a wide range of agent types and behaviors."}, {"title": "5 DESIRE-DRIVEN AUTONOMY FOR DAILY ACTIVITY SIMULATION", "content": "Our Desire-driven autonomy framework consists of two core modules: the Value System and the Desire-driven Planner, supported by essential components such as memory and text-based environments. The Value System manages desire components, each representing the level of satisfaction for a predefined desire dimension. During the simulation setup, these desire components are initialized with initial values $v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and expected values $v^* \\in \\mathbb{R}$, where $d$ represents a specific desire dimension. In each simulation step $t$, the Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) performs four key procedures using the Value System and the Desire-driven Planner to generate the activity $a_t$: Qualitative Value Description, Activity Proposal, Activity Evaluation, and Activity Selection. At the end of each step, the desire components update $v_d^t$ based on $v_d^{t-1}$, the executed activity $a_t$, and the observation $o_t$ provided by the Game Master. The goal of the agent is to perform appropriate activities so its final desire components $v_d^T$ can match the expected values $v_d^*$.\n5.1 DESIRE GENERATION\nThe theory of needs suggests that individual behavior as being motivated by meeting the individual's needs or wants, such as safety, social, esteem, and self-actualization. Furthermore, individuals may prioritize different needs based on their unique profiles, traits, and personalities. These considerations underscore the complexity of human needs and illustrate how these needs drive behavior. To simulate human behavior, we developed a value system that maps personality profile $p$ with the expected desire values $v^*$ (See Appendix E and F). Specifically, for the indoor, single-agent environment, we define 11 desire dimensions. The physiological dimension, representing fundamental survival needs, is further divided into categories such as \u2018hunger', 'thirst', 'sleepiness', 'cleanliness', 'comfort', and 'health'. Safety needs are encapsulated by the 'safeness' dimension. To capture love"}, {"title": "5 DESIRE-DRIVEN AUTONOMY FOR DAILY ACTIVITY SIMULATION"}, {"title": "5.2 VALUE SYSTEM", "content": "As shown in Figure 2, the Value System executes three key procedures at each simulation step: Quantitative Value Deduction, Qualitative Value Description, and Value Update. The Quantitative Value Deduction procedure models the fluctuating nature of human desires by incorporating a decay mechanism for all intrinsic values. At the beginning of each time step $t$, the agent's intrinsic value $v_d^{t-1}$ for desire dimension $d$ is reduced by 1 with a probability $p_d$. This probability is determined by the agent's profile characteristics, following the same mechanism used for the expected desire value mapping described in Appendix E and F. Since fulfilling these desires serves as D2A's intrinsic motivation, the Quantitative Value Deduction procedure is designed to drive the agent to continuously generate desire-driven activities.\nSince many studies have shown that large language models often struggle with interpreting numerical values, we designed the Qualitative Value Description procedure to translate these values into meaningful textual desire descriptions. As shown in our ablation studies (Sec. 6.3.3), the descrip-"}, {"title": "5.3 DESIRE-DRIVEN PLANNER", "content": "The Desire-Driven Planner is responsible for processing the current desire status information provided by the Value System, incorporating historical memory from the memory component, and ultimately determining the agent's next activity. To ensure that the agent's actions are rational and driven by intrinsic desires, the decision-making process is divided into three key procedures: Activity Proposal, Activity Evaluation, and Activity Selection.\nInspired by the work of Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2024), we argue that the paradigm of presenting multiple candidate activities and evaluating them helps the agent select the best action. Thus, during the Activity Proposal procedure (Appendix K), we prompt the agent to generate $N$ candidates (also referred to as planner width, which is set to 3 in our default experimental configuration) activities that may have positive impacts on its desires given $p, e, a_{0:t-1}, o_{0:t-1}$, and desire descriptions $D_t$:\n$$a_t^1, a_t^2, ..., a_t^N \\sim ActivityProposal(\\cdot | D_t, a_{0:t-1}, o_{0:t-1}, p, e; \\theta)$$\n(Here and below, we use conditional probability-like form to represent the sampling formula. This is not a strict probabilistic sampling as in mathematical derivations, but rather a formal way to illustrate the information provided as context and the type of content that needs to be sampled.)\nThese $N$ candidate activities are then passed on to the Activity Evaluation procedure (Appendix L). The Planner evaluates each activity $a_t^i$ by imagining the resulting desire states $D^i$ that the agent would experience after taking action $a_t^i$:\n$$D^i \\sim ActivityEvaluation(\\cdot | D_t, a_t^i; \\theta), i \\in [N]$$\nFinally, in the Activity Selection procedure (Appendix M), the agent compares the forecasted desire states $D^i$ for all $N$ proposed actions. Based on these evaluations, the Planner selects the activity $a_t$ that is expected to best fulfill the agent's intrinsic desires:\n$$a_t \\sim ActivitySelection(\\cdot | \\{D^i, a_t^i\\}, i \\in [N], p, e; \\theta)$$\nThis process ensures that the chosen activity optimally aligns with the agent's intrinsic motivations. After the activity is selected and executed, the environment produces the corresponding observation $o_t$, and the Value System updates the agent's desire components to reflect the new state, completing the simulation step."}, {"title": "6 EXPERIMENT", "content": "In this section, we present a series of experiments conducted within a predefined environment to address three key research questions: (1) Does the Desire-driven Agent (D2A) generate more human-like daily activities compared to baseline approaches? (2) Can the activities generated by D2A satisfy its desires like humans? (3) How do the various components of our framework impact the performance and behaviors of D2A?\n6.1 ENVIRONMENT\nOur main experimental environment is the indoor environment, which consists of a house with four rooms-a kitchen, living area, bedroom, and bathroom-inhabited by a character named Alice. Alice has a detailed profile reflecting her priorities and characteristics across the 11 desire dimensions."}, {"title": "6.2 EVALUATION METRICS", "content": "We use two primary metrics to evaluate the performance of our agent compared to the baselines: Likelihood and Dissatisfaction. By employing these metrics, we can assess the human-likeness as well as the desire-satisfying ability of the proposed agents.\nLikelihood Likelihood measures how closely an agent's behavior resembles that of a human. Given the difficulty of directly measuring human-likeness, we define likelihood by employing an external model to assess the win rate between activity sequences generated by two agents, determining which sequence appears more human-like. We conduct this \"Player vs Player\u201d comparison across the activity sequences produced by the baselines and the D2A agent. Specifically, after obtaining all action sequences $A_p$ for agent $p$, represented as $[A_{seq_1}, ..., A_{seq_d}]$, we randomly select $seq_i, seq_j$ from $[A_i], [A_j]$, respectively, for a given pair of agents $i, j$. These sequences are then compared using GPT-4o. This process is repeated 100 times for each agent pair $i$ and $j (d_i \\ne j)$, and the win rate for each agent is calculated. The results are visualized using a heatmap.\nDissatisfaction Dissatisfaction measures the discrepancy between the agent's current desire values and its expected values. Dissatisfaction $\\delta_t$ of step $t$ is defined as the relative difference between current numerical desire values $v_t$ and expected desire values $v^*$ at the end of simulation step $t$. We calculate $\\delta_t$ after the agent takes the t-th activity and updates its values. The formula used is:\n$$\\delta_t = \\sum_d  \\frac{\\text{max} (v_t^d - v_d^*, 0)}{v_d^*}$$\nBy conducting multiple experiments, we can generate a line plot showing the dissatisfaction over time (Dissatisfaction vs. timestep), with the mean and variance across trials."}, {"title": "6.3 RESULTS", "content": "6.3.1 DOES D2A GENERATE MORE HUMAN-LIKE DAILY ACTIVITIES?\nWe conducted 15 trials for each agent under identical initialization settings across all experiments. After gathering each agent's activity sequences, we found differences in output styles (See Appendix W) that could influence the evaluation by GPT-4o. To mitigate this, we preprocessed all sequences using Llama3.1 70B for style-level rewriting. This ensured more consistent activity sequences across agents, allowing for a fair comparison in the subsequent evaluation."}, {"title": "6.3.2 CAN THE ACTIVITIES GENERATED BY D2A SATISFY ITS DESIRES LIKE HUMANS?", "content": "We conducted two experiments to verify the assumption that D2A generates more human-like activities by satisfying its desires in a manner similar to humans.\nFirst, we performed the Random-8-Steps Experiment to test whether D2A can rationally select activities based on its desires. We incorporated the Value System to visualize the changes in desires while running simulations with the three baseline agents. Although the baseline agents were equipped with the Value System for observation, we ensured that their intrinsic values $v$ and descriptive desire states $D$ remained hidden, preserving their original activity generation mechanisms. We ran the 8-step simulation three times for each agent using the same random initialization, as described in 5.1. As shown in Figure 4(a), D2A significantly outperformed the three baselines, exhibiting lower dissatisfaction means and standard deviations. This result demonstrates that D2A is capable of recognizing both its current desire states and expected states, and can rationally select activities to fulfill its desires, resembling human behavior.\nSecond, we aimed to explain why D2A's behavior appears more human-like by conducting the Fixed-12-Steps Experiment, where we compared the results to human-generated activity sequences. For the four agent-based methods, we initialized each desire component with an initial value of 5, simulating a typical morning scenario where the agent's desires are at moderate levels. We ran the 12-step simulation three times for each agent and gathered the results. Additionally, we"}, {"title": "6.3.3 ABLATION STUDY", "content": "We conducted comprehensive ablation studies to assess the contribution of each designed component to the overall performance of the framework. As shown in Figure 5(a), when the qualitative description component is removed, the agent struggles to accurately interpret its current desire states, resulting in a slower rate of desire fulfillment compared to the original configuration.\nAdditionally, the width parameter of the desire-driven planner proves to be crucial for optimizing the outcomes. A larger width creates a broader activity space, offering more candidate activities for evaluation. Consequently, D2A is better positioned to identify the most suitable activities for achieving the agent's intrinsic desires. As illustrated in Figure 5(b), during the initial steps, D2A(W-1) encounters difficulties in selecting the optimal activity to reduce dissatisfaction, leading to a slower decline in shortfall. In contrast, D2A(W-5) is more effective at selecting activities that minimize dissatisfaction and maintain relatively low dissatisfaction over time.\nAs described in Section 5.3, our D2A doesn't contain a multi-step planning module that plans the next few steps' activities ahead, like some other approaches in consideration of the dynamic nature of desires. We performed an ablation study by adding Concordia's multi-step planning component, which updates the plan for the next few hours based on current desire states. As shown in Figure 5(c), the absence of the multi-step planning component allows D2A to exhibit a better ability to respond to immediate desire states. This may be because when the multi-step planning component is present, D2A tends to adhere to the pre-defined activities in the plan, which may limit its responsiveness to real-time changes in desire states. Furthermore, the plan is scheduled in hourly increments, and D2A cannot effectively predict which desires will experience the greatest shortfall in the next several hours. This limitation may contribute to the slight decline in performance observed when the plan component is included."}, {"title": "7 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "content": "We introduced the Desire-driven Autonomy (D2A) framework to simulate human-like daily activities by aligning agent behavior with intrinsic motivations. Drawing inspiration from Maslow's theory of needs, our framework models agents' desires across multiple dimensions and allows them to autonomously generate and evaluate activities to fulfill these desires. Through extensive simulated experiments, we demonstrated that D2A produces more natural, coherent, and plausible activity sequences compared to baseline methods, including ReAct, BabyAGI, and LLMob. Our experimental results support the hypothesis that modeling intrinsic desires enables agents to make more human-like decisions and behaviors. Moreover, the D2A framework offers promising avenues for further development, as it has shown adaptability with different large language models and potential for enhanced performance with stronger backbones and broader activity proposals. The results provide a solid foundation for future work in desire-driven AI systems for simulating complex, human-like interactions and behaviors.\nLimitations: Although our D2A agent has demonstrated effectiveness and flexibility in simulating human-like activities, several limitations remain. We model the dynamic of a straightforward linear deduction of desire values to simulate the fluctuation of needs. Such simplicity may neglect the organic variation in human desires. For the value space of the desire, we heuristically consider the dimensions of desires based on the features of environments, potentially limiting its ability to model more complex human motivations.\nFuture Works: To simulate more realistic activities in complex environments, we will extend the dynamic of the values of desire and incorporate real-time adaptive planning mechanisms.

We also provided the same pairs to GPT-4o, using our evaluation promptY.1 and both sequences as context, and asked it to determine which sequence appeared more human-like. The consistency rate between human evaluations and GPT-4o's assessments is summarized as follows."}, {"title": "C CASE STUDY FOR DESIRE AND ACTION SELECTION ANALYSIS", "content": "C.1 OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT"}, {"title": "C.2 INDOOR ENVIRONMENT", "content": "in detailed conversations, she did not have the opportunity to showcase herself, which kept her sense of superiority unchanged.\nIn Step 2, her sleepiness began to increase, and she still felt some Dissatisfaction regarding her sense of control.

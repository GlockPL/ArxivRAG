{"title": "See Me and Believe Me: Causality and Intersectionality in Testimonial Injustice in Healthcare", "authors": ["Kenya S. Andrews", "Mesrob I. Ohannessian", "Elena Zheleva"], "abstract": "In medical settings, it is critical that all who are in need of care are correctly heard and understood. When this is not the case due to prejudices a listener has, the speaker is experiencing testimonial injustice, which, building upon recent work, we quantify by the presence of several categories of unjust vocabulary in medical notes. In this paper, we use FCI, a causal discovery method, to study the degree to which certain demographic features could lead to marginalization (e.g., age, gender, and race) by way of contributing to testimonial injustice. To achieve this, we review physicians' notes for each patient, where we identify occurrences of unjust vocabulary, along with the demographic features present, and use causal discovery to build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) relating those demographic features to testimonial injustice. We analyze and discuss the resulting SCMs to show the interaction of these factors and how they influence the experience of injustice. Despite the potential presence of some confounding variables, we observe how one contributing feature can make a person more prone to experiencing another contributor of testimonial injustice. There is no single root of injustice and thus intersectionality cannot be ignored. These results call for considering more than singular or equalized attributes of who a person is when analyzing and improving their experiences of bias and injustice. This work is thus a first foray at using causal discovery to understand the nuanced experiences of patients in medical settings, and its insights could be used to guide design principles throughout healthcare, to build trust and promote better patient care.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Patients seeking medical treatment are not only vulnerable but are simultaneously dependent upon whomever is giving them care at the time. This fact is particularly concerning for those who are not believed or appropriately perceived because of prejudices about them, an experience known as testimonial injustice (Fricker 2019). It has been proven that clinicians are more likely to ignore and make light of the concerns of Black and female patients than White and male patients (Beach et al. 2021; Beach, Branyon, and Saha 2017; L. 2020). Yet, very little work has been done to show the nuances of the experiences for younger Black females, younger Black males, senior White males, senior Latina females, and those of other intersections. This intersectionality informs on how people experience the world due to their attributes, such as demographic features (e.g., race, age, gender, etc.) (Marques 2018). In fact, Black women are more likely to be ostracized and die during childbirth than their White female counterparts (Davis 2019). We hypothesize that a key measurable contributor to this might be testimonial injustice. Therefore, it is imperative to first understand the origins of testimonial injustice and the degree to which they could manifest themselves in medical settings.\nThough it is known that intersectionality of features is necessary to uncover certain cases of testimonial injustice (Andrews, Shah, and Cheng 2023), we lack a comprehensive understanding of which features and how these features causally lead to testimonial injustice and their levels of impact. Here, we aim to address this and expand on such prior work, by using causal discovery to not only show how attributes of a person can come together - intersectionality - to contribute to them experiencing testimonial injustice, and also to understand the specific unjust vocabulary categories through which this injustice is revealed and the intensity with which attributes are contributors.\nThe research question being explored here is: \"Can we identify how individual demographic features influence language in medical settings, leading collectively to testimonial injustice? And once we do, can we quantify the degree to which these interactions contribute to this experience?\". The contributions of this paper are: (1) reviewing physicians notes in a publicly available dataset to identify occurrences of testimonial injustice for patients, (2) performing an exploratory analysis to identify the demographic features of concern, to understand along which axes intersectionality can be analyzed, (3) using causal discovery methods to study the causal structure, through Structural Causal Models (SCMs), of the interaction of those demographic features and experiences of testimonial injustice, and (4) analyzing and discussing the revealed interactions and quantifying the extent of their influence on testimonial injustice, through precise weights within the models."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "Andrews, Shah, and Cheng (2023) conducted an empirical study to show that there is differential treatment between subgroups experiencing testimonial injustice in medical set-"}, {"title": "Problem Description", "content": "Testimonial injustice occurs when a person, as a speaker, is unfairly assigned less credibility by a listener due to prejudices they have about the speaker, resulting in the speaker's statements being unfairly scrutinized (Fricker 2019). The outcome in question in this work is whether someone experiences testimonial injustice (is_testinj=1) or not in their medical records. Testimonial injustice can be experienced by a patient throughout different interactions in medical settings, including when physicians are discussing the patient and their symptoms in their notes. Since word choice reveals attitudes one may have about a subject (Von Hippel, Sekaquaptewa, and Vargas 2008), we analyze the word choices of physician in their notes about their patients. Thus, this study explores four categories of terms which may contribute to testimonial injustice, referred to here as testimonially unjust terms: evidential terms, judgemental terms, negative terms, and stigmatizing terms. They are further discussed in the Testimonial Injustice Lexicon section).\nWe are particularly concerned with how this word choice may be experienced due to intersectional group experiences (e.g., Black female child, Latino male adult, Latino male senior, etc.). MIMIC-III (Johnson et al. 2016) allows us to have access to features that could be contributors to testimonial injustice: race, gender, and age of patients. These are features of the speaker that, to some degree, can be inferred by the human eye and thus could influence the behavior of the listener. These features of concern could all contribute to word choices in someone's medical notes which lead to testimonial injustice, but it is important to know the degree to which these features influence someone experiencing these word choices and the degree to which these word choices are contributors to this form of injustice. To understand the features' causal relationships to testimonial injustice, we consider them as treatment variables here and assign them based on the assumptions discussed in the Assumptions section."}, {"title": "Assumptions", "content": "Do you see me? We binarize our treatment variables (i.e., gender, race, and age), in order to study their intersectionality more easily with limited amount of data. These binary attributes can then be thought of as treatment variables in our causal analysis. The dimension along which we perform this binarization is that of historical marginalization. Experiments from Beach et al. (2021) show that those who are women and/or those who are Black are more likely to experience testimonial injustice compared to their White or"}, {"title": "Data", "content": "MIMIC-III\nWe use the MIMIC-III (Johnson et al. 2016) dataset to review medical records of patients from the ICU of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA between 2001-2012. These records contain features of interest to the experiments conducted here including: ethnicity/race, gender, age, patient id, diagnosis, physicians' notes, etc. (e.g., Black, female, 47, 5432, Bronchitis, \u201cpatient claims to be experiencing...\u201d). The MIMIC-III dataset contains information for approximately 61,000 patients.\nAs explained in the Problem Description, the demographic features of concern for this work are race, gender, and age. These are included in the dataset, and we deem them features that can be inferred by people, based on visible observations. The proportion of racial groups represented in the dataset are highly imbalanced, which is likely due to the region the hospital is located in. The MIMIC-III feature 'ethnicity' often contained the race of the patient (e.g., \u2018Asian \u2014 VIETNAMESE'), but for simplicity and a particular concern of race, not region of origin, we simplify 'ethnicity' into 'race' (i.e., original ethnicity in the dataset: 'Asian \u2013 VIETNAMESE' was coded into the race category as 'Asian') (similar to the method of Andrews, Shah, and Cheng (2023)). We removed ethnicities that were listed as \"unknown/not specified\u201d, \u201cmulti-race ethnicity\", \"other\u201d, \u201cunable to obtain\u201d, and \u201cpatient declined to answer\" since they cannot be clearly associated with any race. The two genders represented in this dataset, female and male, however, are more balanced. The ages of the patients are coded, disjointed, and spread across many tables in the dataset. The age is not fully recoverable for patients over the age of 89 and under the age of 1, but is able to be approximated. We grouped the ages of the patients by child (\u2264 15), adult (16-64), and senior (\u2265 65). After this grouping, we observed that there were far fewer records for child patients"}, {"title": "Testimonial Injustice Lexicon", "content": "To assess testimonial injustice in the physicians' notes, we focus on four main categories of unjust terms that can contribute to someone experiencing testimonial injustice: evidential, judgemental, negative, and stigmatizing terms.\nIn this work, we use the same evidential and judgemental terms from Beach et al. (2021). Evidential terms simply state a claim without taking a particular proposition on the factuality of a statement (e.g., \u201ccomplains\u201d, \u201csays\", \"tells me\", etc.). When a physician uses evidential terms, a patient's experience can be more easily dismissed since it is stated as more of a conjecture. Judgemental terms convey skepticism from a listener (i.e., the physician) by trying to assert that the speaker's statements sound good or bad (e.g., \u201capparently\u201d, \u201cclaims\u201d, \u201cinsists\", etc.). Negative terms have lead to racial and ethnic healthcare disparities, particularly for Black patients (Sun et al. 2022). Therefore, negative terms are also included in this study. Some of the terms in this lexicon are listed in the lexicon by Zhang (2022). These terms often show active denial or rejection, e.g., \"challeng-ing\", \"combative\u201d, \u201cdefensive\u201d, \u201cexaggerate\u201d, etc. Stigmatizing terms are characterizations of a person, often due to stereotypes or stigmas about them, (Link and Phelan 2001) (e.g., \"user\", \"faking\u201d, \u201ccheat\", etc.) they are also used in this study. Using stigmatizing terms may alter treatment plans, transmit biases between clinicians, and alienate patients (Himmelstein, Bates, and Zhou 2022). This lexicon consist of terms used to diminish specific conditions like diabetes, substance use disorder, and chronic pain. All of these conditions are known to disproportionately affect racial minority groups. See the full base lexicon in the Appendix.\""}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "Lexicon Lookup\nWe combine the testimonially unjust terms introduced in the Testimonial Injustice Lexicon section, under each of the categories commonly associated with being evidentially biased, judgemental, negative, and stigmatizing, into a lexicon to be used for exact-matching lookup. We then expand this lexicon by finding and adding the stem of these words and five synonyms associated with each unjust term in its respective category. We do this by using nltk's WordNet corpus (Bird, Klein, and Loper 2009). This expansion is necessary since exact-matching is limited in reach- there can be many variations of the same word, improperly used tenses of words, or words which are similar in meaning, etc. This helps find more occurrences of testimonially unjust terms in the records of more patients.\nAggregating Notes\nTo account for patients who had multiple physician visits or who spent several nights in the ICU, we combine the physicians' notes over each patient's duration in the ICU. To be precise, for a given patient and term category, we count the number of terms in that category in each note during that patient's stay, we then add these counts and divide by the number of original records we have for that particular patient's ICU stint. Thus, for each patient, we obtain and use the (average) number of unjust terms per record, for each category. This allows us to ensure that no patient is weighted more heavily than another, based on the duration of their stay or number of visits from physicians.\nInstances of Injustice\nWe take the stance that a patient is experiencing fair and just testimony when there are no instances of unjust terms found in their records. This agrees with the perspective of Andrews, Shah, and Cheng (2023). Conversely, this means testimonial injustice occurs whenever there is a representation from any of the unjust term categories. However, since context behind word choice is not fully considered here, we loosen this definition of fairness to allow up to a certain threshold of words without triggering any given category. Specifically, we set the threshold to be 10% of the 90th percentile of unjust terms per record for any single patient. We also explored an alternative thresholding system, using"}, {"title": "Causal Discovery", "content": "The main goal of this work is to understand how observable demographic features of patients, namely race, gender, and age, contribute to someone experiencing testimonial injustice. We use the causal-learn library (Zheng et al. 2023) in Python to run experiments using a causal discovery algorithm, FCI, to infer and visualize Structural Causal Models behind what the MIMIC-III dataset reveals about testimonial injustice. FCI relies on random ordering of conditional independence tests, and the outputs can slightly vary. We report outputs that are consistently produced.\nFast Causal Inference (FCI) Fast Causal Inference FCI (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000) is a constraint-based causal discovery algorithm. The advantage of this algorithm over the typical PC Algorithm (discussed further in the Algorithmic Variations section), is that it allows for unknown confounders. This is particularly useful in this medical setting where we are only considering demographic features that can be observationally inferred. For instance, the specific condition one has could also have a large effect on the views of the doctors towards them, i.e., preventable diseases tend to carry more negative and stigmatizing language to inherited conditions (Beach et al. 2021; P Goddu et al. 2018). FCI is also more informative about confounders and potential directions of causation than PC. The assumptions of the FCI algorithm are that the true graphs follow the Markov and Faithfulness conditions (see Assumptions). In our experiments, we constrain the age, gender, and race as treatment variables, i.e., root causes in the graph, meaning that none of the other variables in the graph cause them. We also constraint is_testinj as a leaf node, i.e., it must be an outcome of the SCM."}, {"title": "Experiments and Results", "content": "We conducted experiments to inform us of how demographic features may contribute to someone experiencing testimonial injustice, using causal discovery with the FCI algorithm. We constrained the age, gender, and race as treatment variables, i.e., root causes in the graph, and is_testinj as a leaf node, i.e., it must be an outcome of the generated SCMs. Upon conducting these experiments, we noticed that at lower $\\alpha$-values some demographic features struggled to connect with the SCM and acted as stand-alone variables. Thus, we steadily increased the $\\alpha$-value (starting at 0.01) while running the FCI algorithm, in order to determine the levels of $\\alpha$ at which we detect the influence of at least one demographic feature, two features, and all three features being connected to the SCM. This also acts as an indicator of the strength of these connections, the strongest appearing first. We found that at $\\alpha = 0.01$, $\\alpha = 0.12$, $\\alpha = 0.57$ are the thresholds to get one, two, and all three demographic features connected respectively.\nAt the typically used value of $\\alpha = 0.05$, race remains the only demographic feature that can be detected to relate to testimonial injustice. We do not believe that this is the sole contributing factor; however, we can rationalize it as a strong contributor due to the high racial tensions in the United States, where the data was collected. This is remarkable evidence considering the imbalanced race distribution of patients in this dataset (recall Table 1) i.e., despite the low representation, there is a clear indication of injustice along these lines. Beyond this, if we increase $\\alpha$ to 0.12- still relatively low-gender becomes connected within our SCMs. Immediately, we can see the intersectionality of race and gender as joint contributors of someone experiencing judgemental terms, which remains only 1-hop away from someone experiencing testimonial injustice or not. This could reveal that there are nuances that occur when we look at judgemental terms along race and gender (e.g., Black Women, White Women, Black Males, etc.) Further, we see that age struggles to be connected to the SCM. In fact, it requires an increase of $\\alpha$ to 0.57 before we can see it become connected to our SCM. This helps us to see that race, age, and gender can all lead to someone experiencing judgemental terms, which remains only 1-hop away from is_testinj, revealing the nuances that can exist for those who are marginalized across all of these demographic features (e.g., young Black Women, young Latina Women, senior White Women, etc.). From this SCM, we see gender can be directly indicative of someone experiencing testimonial injustice and it does so primarily through the use of judgemental terms.\nThroughout these SCMs, race consistently indicates a connection to individuals experiencing stigmatizing terms, which is a direct cause (i.e., 1-hop away) of experiencing testimonial injustice. These coexisting facts express that both race and gender are important variables that need to be noted together when looking for someone who may be experiencing testimonial injustice, but may be particularly easier to see those interactions when stigmatizing terms are present. Similarly, the path from gender to judgemental terms and then to testimonial injustice, as well as from race to evidential terms to testimonial injustice, highlights critical relationships. We can also see that there exists an unknown confounder between evidential terms and judgemental terms. Observing both race and gender helps us to see effects despite this unknown confounder. Moreover, if we focus solely on gender-particularly considering that males often do not belong to marginalized groups\u2014we risk overlooking the nuanced language and expressions that could indicate or support the occurrence of testimonial injustice related to evidential and stigmatizing terms. This is especially critical because these patterns may only become evident when we also examine intersections with race and age. For instance, looking specifically at judgemental terms used to describe young Black males or senior Latino males highlights the importance of intersectionality. Similarly, when we analyze evidential terms in the context of race, we find that they are often influenced by the judgemental terms associated with these groups. Another interesting observation is that negative terms are not directly a result of marginalization, rather they occur as a consequence of the presence of other testimonially unjust terms. This intersection of race, age, and gender underscores the complexity of how testimonial injustice manifests and the need to consider multiple factors simultaneously to fully understand the issue.\nWe hypothesize that seeing all three demographic features connected required a higher $\\alpha$ as a consequence of having too little data. To verify this hypothesis, we artificially doubled our dataset and re-ran our experiments. Upon doing so, we observed similar connectivity in the graphs but now occurring at lower $\\alpha$-values, see Figure 2. We observe here that doubling the data yielded very similar graphs. They contain most of the same edges, with lesser probabilities of undefined confounders (perhaps due to the algorithm becoming more confident), and the path to the testimonial injustice outcome from the gender and race features is shortened. Even when utilizing this larger dataset, it remains necessary to elevate the parameter $\\alpha$, only moderately here, to adequately capture the intricate relationships among each of the demographic features to testimonial injustice."}, {"title": "Algorithmic Variations", "content": "The Peter-Clark (PC) Algorithm (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000) is a traditional constraint-based causal discovery algorithm that uses conditional independence testing to form causal relationships. The assumptions of the PC algorithm are that the true graphs follow the Markov Condition, Faithfulness Condition, and Causal sufficiency (discussed in the Assumptions section). We used PC to see how much the SCMs are affected by algorithmic variations. PC yields similar results to the FCI experiments, under the same experimental runs with similar $\\alpha$-values. We show these in Figure 4 of the Appendix. One important observation is that age continues to struggle to be connected to our SCMs at lower values of $\\alpha$. Another is that multiple demographic features continue to contribute to one experiencing a type of term which could lead to testimonial injustice. In nearly all of the experiments, we see a path from evidential to negative to stigmatizing terms. The common trends that occurs across FCI and PC algorithms are that evidentials are often noted as a parent to one experiencing other terms, in several instances race is the only at-"}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "The main findings of this work are as follows: Age, gender, and race all contribute to testimonial injustice in varying amounts and in different ways. Based on the level of detection (i.e., alpha), race shows up first in our SCMs, then gender, and then age, exhibiting their relative strength of influence from strongest to weakest. Through race, we see patients are likely to experience evidential terms, judgemental terms, and stigmatizing terms. This tells us that due to their race, patients' experiences in emergency settings are likely to be dismissed, diminished, and vilified. On the other hand, gender and age directly lead to the use of judgemental terms, showing that physicians, even if they acknowledge the patient, may remain skeptical and critical of them due to gender and, to a lesser extent, age. Evidential, judgemental, and stigmatizing terms are detected to be the primary causes of testimonial injustice. Negative terms, on the other hand, appear to not be used by physicians in the absence of other aspects of injustice, but rather to be manifestations of these.\nHints of these disparities are already evident in a cursory look at the occurrences of these terms across the various intersectional groups. For example, there are roughly 14 times the number of White to Black patients (see Table 2 in the Appendix), yet the numbers experiencing testimonial injustice are similar among adults across both genders. However, our causal analysis of the relationship between several contributing factors to (i.e., demographic features) and components of (i.e., unjust terms categories) testimonial injustice reveals nuanced facts about their interaction. In particular, the importance of intersectionality is evident, as no single contributing factor can on its own explain the use of unjust terms. We believe that we need such insight to in turn help target efforts to mitigate such injustice.\nA limitation here is the origin of the data. Boston has a median age of approximately 33 for both male and females. In terms of race, Boston is mostly comprised of White (50.13%) people, followed by the minoritized races in the US: Black (21.7%), Asian (9.59%), and Latino (5.92%) (USA 2022). Despite this, all of the algorithms concur that race can most obviously be seen as a contributor of someone experiencing testimonial injustice. Gender and age do factor in too, as each of our experimenters shows us that there are nuanced experiences based on intersectionality and the degree to which they might occur.\nBetter data- more representative of marginalized group -is however critical to advance this agenda forward. Access to adequate datasets in healthcare that encompass a distribution of patients that is reflective of our society is rare, but even more so when looking for equal proportions across race and age. This is due to several factors: lack of access to proper care, damaged trust and relationships between marginalized people and the healthcare system, etc.\nIf healthcare facilities that attend to diverse patients develop datasets with diverse race, gender, and age distributions, they would provide an invaluable service to the algorithmic fairness research community. In the present context, this would help with obtaining more accurate causal relationships, especially when augmented with other features that are not observable but are known to hospital staff.\nMoving forward, it is also worth taking a closer look at the details of the obtained SCMs. For example, the FCI graphs reveal that there are unknown confounders between someone experiencing stigmatizing and judgemental terms - which is likely stereotyping due to implicit biases toward the patient leading to them experiencing testimonial injustice. This invites further investigation, e.g., perhaps there is a feature here unique to one's experiences as a woman to them experiencing stigmatizing language that leads to testimonial injustice, such as perceived obesity or marital status.\nMeanwhile, the present work leads us to appreciate that we must be seen for the various aspects of who we are, to reveal whether we are truly believed or dismissed in an act of testimonial injustice."}]}

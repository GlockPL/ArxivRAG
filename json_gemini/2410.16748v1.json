While\nIndustry 4.0 focuses primarily on the efficiency, automation, and digitization of manufacturing\nprocesses, Industry 5.0 aims to broaden this vision. It not only emphasizes productivity but also\nincorporates the wellbeing of workers, societal prosperity, and the planet's ecological boundaries\ninto the core of industrial strategies. This new vision for European industry aims to drive both digital\nand green transitions by placing technological innovation at the service of humanity and\nsustainability.\nAs highlighted by the European Commission, Industry 5.0 [1] promotes a future-oriented\napproach where industries actively contribute to solving societal challenges such as resource\npreservation, climate change, and social stability. By adopting circular production models and\noptimizing the use of natural resources, Industry 5.0 offers solutions that extend beyond traditional\nbusiness objectives [2, 3]. It empowers workers by addressing evolving skill needs and training\nrequirements, enhances industrial competitiveness, and attracts top talent. Moreover, revising\nexisting value chains and improving energy efficiency allows industries to become more resilient to\nexternal shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, Industry 5.0 not only benefits\nbusinesses but also supports the wider society, ensuring that technological progress serves human\nprosperity and environmental sustainability.\nWhile the concept of Industry 5.0 presents a compelling future vision, it also faces significant\nchallenges due to its broad and often ambiguous definition. Unlike Industry 4.0 [4, 5], which is\nclosely associated with specific technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence\n(AI), and automation, the scope of Industry 5.0 is not as clearly delineated. This ambiguity has led\nto difficulties in determining which technologies and innovations truly belong to the realm of\nIndustry 5.0, resulting in confusion among researchers and practitioners alike. Although there is a\ngrowing body of literature on the subject, it often lacks clear direction, making it challenging to\ndevelop a comprehensive understanding of the concept.\nTo address this issue, it is essential for research communities and industry stakeholders to work\ntogether to create taxonomies and frameworks that define Industry 5.0 more clearly. Such efforts\nwould not only aid researchers in navigating the extensive and diverse literature but also provide\nbusinesses and organizations with roadmaps to implement Industry 5.0 strategies effectively. These\ntaxonomies could serve as a foundation for establishing clear definitions and boundaries within\nIndustry 5.0, guiding the future development and application of the technologies associated with this\nindustrial revolution.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer a promising solution to this challenge by automating\nthe analysis of large volumes of literature. With AI algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA), BERTopic, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), or simpler algorithms such as K-means\nclustering etc. [6, 7, 8], researchers can automatically categorize academic and industrial\npublications into thematic clusters, identifying the central topics that define Industry 5.0. These\nalgorithms allow for the extraction of patterns and trends from diverse and unstructured text data,\nhelping to establish a more structured understanding of Industry 5.0. By analyzing the vast body of\nliterature in this way, AI can assist in creating a roadmap for researchers and professionals, offering\ninsights into the key areas of focus within the emerging landscape of Industry 5.0.\nThe objective of this article is precisely that\u2014to leverage AI algorithms to uncover the key trends\nand themes that characterize Industry 5.0 as reflected in the literature. By applying various machine\nlearning models, this study aims to provide an automated approach to understanding the core topics\nof Industry 5.0. The analysis will focus on classifying a collection of articles into meaningful\ncategories, with the ultimate goal of guiding future research and industrial practices."}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Towards industry 5.0", "content": "Industry 5.0 represents a shift beyond the principles of Industry 4.0 by focusing on a more human-\ncentric, resilient, and sustainable approach.

One of the most popular methods is Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA), a probabilistic model that assigns words to topics based on their co-occurrence\nacross documents [18, 19]]. LDA is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing\nthematic structures. Another key approach is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) [20, 21], which\napplies singular value decomposition (SVD) to a term-document matrix, reducing the dimensionality\nand uncovering latent relationships between terms and documents. BERTopic is a more recent\ndevelopment that leverages transformer models and dynamic embeddings to generate high-quality,\ncoherent topics [22]. BERTopic stands out for its ability to handle contextualized text representations\nand is particularly useful in cases where fine-tuning based on word context is needed.\nEach topic modeling technique offers benefits and is appropriate for different types of datasets, depending\non the structure, size, and complexity of the data. More specifically,\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nLDA is highly interpretable and flexible, making it one of the most popular techniques. It based on\nDirichlet probabilistic distribution of words across topics, making it easier to assign thematic meanings\nto clusters of words. LDA works well when the dataset consists of moderate-length texts (e.g.,\nacademic articles, news articles, or long-form reviews). It performs best when the assumption of topics\nbeing a mixture of words is valid, and it offers control over the number of topics. However, LDA might\nnot perform well on short texts or contexts with semantics.\nLSA main benefit is the reduction of dimensionality through matrix factorization. This helps to uncover\nrelationships between terms and documents that might not be immediately obvious. It is useful for\nidentifying latent structures in data without requiring a probabilistic model. It is more effective when\napplied to datasets that are well-structured but contain noise or redundant information, as it can smooth\nout noise while highlighting key thematic connections. It is commonly used with medium to large\ndatasets (e.g., corpora of academic papers or legal documents) and is suitable when data dimensionality\nreduction is needed. LSA, however, faces difficulties with ambiguity and lacks the ability to capture\ncontextual nuances.\nBERTopic is particularly strong in handling contextualized text and short texts, leveraging advanced\ntransformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT) to capture the semantics of words in their specific context.\nThis approach generates highly coherent topics and adapts dynamically to changing datasets.\nBERTopic is ideal for datasets with complex, nuanced language or contexts, such as social media posts,\ncustomer reviews, and conversational data, where understanding the meaning of words in context is\ncrucial. Its ability to handle diverse, smaller datasets makes it particularly valuable for dynamic, real-\ntime data like tweets or news headlines."}, {"title": "3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY", "content": "The research methodology employed in this study aimed at uncovering key trends and themes in\nIndustry 5.0, using advanced AI-based topic modeling algorithms on a comprehensive dataset of\narticles related to the subject.

Given that the data consisted of text-\nbased PDF files, several preprocessing steps were taken to transform the raw documents into a format\nsuitable for algorithmic analysis. The goal of this step was to reduce noise and remove irrelevant\ndata while preserving the core content of each document.\na) All PDF files were converted to plain text format to facilitate easier manipulation and processing.\nThis conversion was carried out using Python-based tools capable of handling large volumes of\nPDF documents. By converting the articles to text files, we were able to perform text\npreprocessing steps programmatically, ensuring consistency across the dataset.\nb) Removal of Stopwords and Noise. The next preprocessing task was the removal of common\nstopwords words like \u201cand,\u201d \u201cthe,\u201d \u201cof,\u201d etc., which do not contribute to the thematic content\nof the articles. The Python library NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) was employed to perform\nthis task efficiently. Additionally, a custom list of stopwords was created based on the most\nfrequently occurring non-relevant words within the dataset. This custom stopword list was\ngenerated by analyzing the data using ChatGPT, which helped identify domain-specific terms\nand phrases that were irrelevant to the thematic analysis (e.g., publication-specific metadata like\n\"figure,\" \"table,\u201d and other frequently repeated sections like \u201creferences\u201d).\nc) To further refine the dataset, we removed the references section from each document, as this\nsection typically does not contribute to the main themes of the text.

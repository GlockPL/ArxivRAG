This allows one to incorporate exceptions\nto general rules into a logical system, and for old conclusions to be withdrawn\nupon learning new contradictory information. Standpoint logics are a group of\nlogics, introduced to the field of Knowledge Representation in the last 5 years,\nwhich allow for multiple viewpoints to be integrated into the same ontology, even\nwhen certain viewpoints may hold contradicting beliefs. In this paper, we aim to\nintegrate standpoints into KLM propositional logic in a restricted setting. We in-\ntroduce the logical system of Defeasible Restricted Standpoint Logic (DRSL) and\ndefine its syntax and semantics. Specifically, we integrate ranked interpretations\nand standpoint structures, which provide the semantics for propositional KLM\nand propositional standpoint logic respectively, in order to introduce ranked stand-\npoint structures for DRSL. Moreover, we extend the non-monotonic entailment\nrelation of rational closure from the propositional KLM case to the DRSL case.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to characterize rational closure for DRSL\nboth algorithmically and semantically, showing that rational closure can be char-\nacterized through a single representative ranked standpoint structure. Finally, we\nconclude that the semantic and algorithmic characterizations of rational closure\nare equivalent, and that entailment-checking for DRSL under rational closure is\nin the same complexity class as entailment-checking for propositional KLM.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Within the field of symbolic AI, much work has been dedicated to reasoning with in-\nformation which is incomplete, or is seemingly contradictory.

We use a slightly more expressive syntax than the traditional KLM\nwhich allows for conjunctions between propositions.\nThat is, we define the language of KLM propositional logic , over a set of propo-\nsitional atoms P, as defined by\n$\\varphi ::= \\alpha|\\alpha \\leadsto \\beta | \\varphi \\land \\varphi,$\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are Boolean formulas with atoms in P.\nThe semantics for is referred to as ranked interpretations.

Every precisificaton is then mapped\nto an underlying semantic structure for the \"base logic\". In first order, or description\nlogics, this corresponds to a first-order interpretation structure [16]. Using the standard\nsemantics for KLM defeasible logic, we will construct a ranked interpretation for each\ngiven precisification.\nDefinition 6.

The syntax and\nsemantics for standpoint modalities used in this paper was developed in the proposi-\ntional case by G\u00f3mez \u00c1lvarez and Rudolph [15]. Similar notions of standpoints have\nsince been introduced to first order logic [16], various description logics [16-18] and\nlinear temporal logic [13]. The defeasible logic of KLM was originally introduced by\nKraus et al. [19] with rational closure defined by Lehmann and Magidor [21]. Although\ndefeasible implication has not been studied previously in the case for standpoints, sim-\nilar notions have been previously considered. Britz et al. [3, 4] consider introducing\nas a non-monotonic consequence relation between propositions in modal logics.\nAnother aspect of defeasibility in modal logic are defeasible modal operators, which\nhave been considered by Britz and Varzinczak [5] in the general case and Chafik et\nal. [10] in the case of linear temporal logic. Other non-modal extensions of KLM-style\ndefeasibility and derived non-monotonic entailments have been considered in the de-\nscription logics case [2, 6, 9], as well as for first order logic and some of its decidable\nfragments [7, 11, 22]."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "The main focus of this paper was to integrate standpoint modal operators into KLM-\nstyle defeasible propositional logic. In order to do this we defined Defeasible Restricted\nStandpoint Logic (DRSL), by introducing a syntax which allows KLM propositional\nsymbols to be bound by standpoint modal operators. We introduced the semantics of\nDRSL through ranked standpoint structures, combining the notion of ranked interpre-\ntations for propositional KLM [21], and the semantic approaches used to define other\nstandpoint logics [15, 16]. We then introduced a non-monotonic entailment relation for\nDRSL, which we proposed as a natural extension to rational closure in the propositional\ncase [21], denoted . This was first defined via a rational closure algorithm, which\nwe showed provided a method for entailment-checking in DRSL that was of the same\ncomplexity class as the rational closure algorithm in the propositional case. Lastly, we\nshowed that could be equivalently defined semantically, specifically constructing\na single ranked standpoint structure such that K if and only if . \nFor future work, the most obvious question would be to enquire whether a more\nexpressive version of DRSL can be defined (for example including negation and dis-\njunction of standpoint bound formulas), and what effects allowing for a more expres-\nsive logic would have on the complexity and semantic constructions linked to a non-\nmonotonic entailment, such as rational closure. It seems initially that this case would\nbe significantly more difficult to consider, since we lose the Single Model property\nwhen we introduce negation and disjunction into KLM in the propositional case [23].\nAnother notion to explore, although mentioned briefly in the paper, is the possibility\nof extending other non-monotonic consequence relations defined in the propositional\ncase to the standpoint case, such as lexicographic closure [20]. It would also be desir-\nable to investigate the proof-theoretic properties of in the standpoint logic case\nand compare those to the original KLM postulates given by Kraus et al. [19]. Another\ninteresting problem to investigate would be the integration of standpoints into more ex-\npressive KLM-style defeasible logics, such as defeasible description logics (DDLs) [2].\nSince standpoint have seen to be integratable in other description logics [16, 18], it\nseems plausible that this would work in the case of DDLs."}, {"title": "A Appendix", "content": ""}, {"title": "A.1 Proofs of Results in Sections 3 and 4", "content": "Lemma 1.

We begin in the \"basic cases\" where our formula \u03c8 is equal to \u03c6 or equal to\n\u25a1s \u03c6 for a single standpoint modal operator \u25a1s and some \u03c6 \u2208 L .

If \u03c6 = \u25a1s then \u25a1\u2081 ...\u25a1k\u25a1s \u03c8 is equivalent to \u03c8. It\nis also clear to see that if we take any finite number of conjunctions of \"basic\" formulas,\nwe obtain a formula still in normal form.\nFinally, we consider a case where we apply a standpoint operator to a finite conjunc-\ntion of basic formulas. From the previous reasoning, and the commutativity of A we can\nwithout loss of generality express this conjunction in the form \u03c61 ^\u25a1s\u2082 \u03c61^ \u25a1s\u2082 \u03c62 ^\u2026^\u25a1sk \u03c6k\nfor i \u2208 L .

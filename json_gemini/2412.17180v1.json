{"title": "COVID-19 on YouTube: A Data-Driven Analysis of Sentiment, Toxicity, and Content Recommendations", "authors": ["Vanessa Su", "Nirmalya Thakur"], "abstract": "This study presents a data-driven analysis of COVID-19 discourse on YouTube, examining the sentiment, toxicity, and thematic patterns of video content published between January 2023 and October 2024. The analysis involved applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with VADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32% of video descriptions were positive, 36.63% were neutral, and 14.05% were negative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in pandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91% of content as toxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed two main themes, with 66.74% of the videos covering general health information and pandemic-related impacts and 33.26% focused on news and real-time updates, highlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system was also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by sentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned video recommendations. This system achieved 69% aggregate coverage, with monthly coverage rates consistently above 85%, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed coverage reaching 69% for five video recommendations and 79% for ten video recommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for understanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that supports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content related to COVID-19.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most disruptive global events in recent history, significantly impacting public health, economic stability, and social structures worldwide [1]. As communities around the globe navigated waves of infection, lockdowns, and evolving public health guidelines, the flow of information about COVID-19 on the internet became crucial to shaping public understanding and response [2]. During this crisis, social media platforms emerged as essential channels for real-time information dissemination, public expression, and community interaction [3,4]. Among these platforms, YouTube has played a particularly influential role, providing a mix of authoritative updates from health organizations, personal experiences from affected individuals, and diverse user-generated commentary accessible to a global audience. The platform's video-based format uniquely facilitated comprehensive and narrative-driven insights that captured a wide spectrum of public attitudes, emotions, and interpretations surrounding COVID-19 [5,6].\nAs of April 2024, YouTube had more than 2.5 million monthly active users [7]. It is predicted that YouTube's audience will grow by nearly 25% over the next five years, and by 2029, YouTube's user base will comprise 1.2 billion users [8]. In 2023, YouTube accounted for 10.25% of Google's total revenue. Furthermore, in 2023, YouTube's advertising revenue was $31.5 billion, up from $29.2 billion in 2022 [9]. As of July 2024, YouTube had the most significant influence in India, with 476 million users, making it the platform's largest market. India is followed by the US (238 million users), Brazil (147 million users), Indonesia (139 million users), Mexico (84.2 million users), Japan (79.4 million users), Pakistan (66.1 million users), Germany (65.7 million users), Vietnam (63 million users), Philippines (58.1 million users), Turkey (58.1 million users), the United Kingdom (55.7 million users), and other countries [10]. The current global distribution of YouTube users shows that 54.3% are males and 45.7% are females [11]. The largest group of YouTube users worldwide are males aged 25 to 34, accounting for 12.1% of the total user base [12].\nAs per the findings of a survey, among Generation Z video consumers in the US, approximately 29.3% of the time they spent engaging with video format was spent on YouTube [13]. In December 2023, the highest monthly visits to YouTube, at 22 billion, were from the US. The US was followed by India (10.15 billion visits), Brazil (6.6 billion visits), South Korea (6.17 billion visits), and other countries. In December 2023 alone, YouTube recorded approximately 98 billion visits on mobile and over 8 billion visits from users on desktop devices [14]. In summary, since the beginning of COVID-19, YouTube, a globally popular social media platform, has become even more popular. Therefore, understanding the discourse on YouTube is essential for grasping the collective sentiment around the pandemic, the themes that dominate public discussion, and the nature of content that informs and influences viewers. Prior research on analyzing the public discourse about COVID-19 on social media has largely focused on text-based social media"}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Since the beginning of the pandemic, several works have focused on the role of YouTube as a platform for disseminating information and capturing public views, opinions, perspectives, and sentiment toward COVID-19.\nObadimu et al. [33] studied how toxic behavior spread in YouTube discussions during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. They collected data from 544 channels that comprised more than 3,488 videos and 849,689 comments. Through topic modeling and social network analysis, they identified influential commenters and the top toxic users in the network. Jin et al. [34] examined the polarization and effects of user engagement on COVID-19-related videos on YouTube. They analyzed 6,668 videos, and the findings of their work showed that user engagement with these videos progressively increased over time. Their work also showed that videos containing lower content bias generally achieved higher rankings in search results on YouTube. Di Marco et al. [35] studied the formation of echo chambers on YouTube during the pandemic. They studied the data of 2 million users' engagement released by 68 YouTube channels. The findings showed that the echo chamber structure cannot be reproduced after properly randomizing user interaction patterns. Their study also indicated a relation between the political bias of users and their tendency to consume highly questionable news. Jagtap et al. [36] developed an approach for detecting misinformation related to COVID-19 on YouTube based on the analysis of video subtitles. They analyzed a dataset of over 2943 videos related to COVID- 19. Their approach classified the videos into three classes (misinformation, debunking misinformation, and neutral) with a 0.85 to 0.90 F1 score. Triantafyllopoulos et al. [37] presented the COVYT dataset, comprising speech samples from 65 individuals extracted from platforms such as YouTube and TikTok. Some of the individuals had COVID-19, whereas others did not. Their research focused on studying the impact of COVID-19 on speech, and their work showed that it was possible to detect COVID-19 based on speech samples collected from YouTube.\nXie et al. [38] focused on the challenges faced by people with visual impairments (PVI) during the pandemic, specifically on YouTube. They studied 24 videos published by PVI and 27 videos published by the news media community, where 57 PVI were depicted. The findings of their study showed that PVI accessibility can be easily missed on YouTube. Breazu et al. [39] investigated the increasing racism and xenophobia with a particular focus on the Roma community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors performed a critical discourse analysis of comments on a YouTube video published early in the pandemic. The findings showed that users expressed racist and xenophobic views, particularly within the Romanian context. They also discussed how the affordances of social media might increase the chances of being exposed to racism. Soares et al. [40] studied the promotion of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-related misinformation on YouTube in Brazil by focusing on two research questions: first, how pro-HCQ content is disseminated on YouTube, and second, how YouTube's algorithm"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "Figure 1 presents the step-by-step methodology that was followed in this research project. The dataset was developed by writing a program in Python 3.10 that performed data mining by connecting with the YouTube API. This program used keyword search for the data mining process, and the keywords that were used to collect COVID-19-related videos were \u201cCOVID,\" \"COVID19\" \"coronavirus,\u201d \u201cCOVID-19\", \"corona,\" and \"SARS-CoV-2\". For each video that contained at least one of these keywords in the title or the description, the program stored the URL of the video, video ID, video title, video description, and date of publication of the video in a CSV file. The information of 15,145 videos published on YouTube between January 1, 2023, and October 25, 2024 (the most recent date at the time of performing data mining) was obtained from this program. Thereafter, duplicate records were removed, and videos that were not related to COVID-19 were deleted, which resulted in the CSV file containing the data of 9,325 videos published between the same date range. Then, the yt_dlp package in Python [52] was used to extract the number of views, likes, comments, duration (in seconds), categories, tags, language, and availability of captions per video. These results were stored as separate attributes in the dataset.\nThe next step, data preprocessing, was crucial for standardizing and preparing the text data for the model-building and data analysis tasks. The data preprocessing was performed on the video descriptions. The pipeline included converting text to lowercase, removing URLs, user mentions, hashtags, and non-alphabetic characters, retaining emotion-specific emojis, eliminating common English stop words, stemming, and lemmatization. Here, emotion-specific emojis refer to \nand, as per the findings of prior work [53] in this field. Sentiment analysis of the video descriptions was conducted using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) [54], as it has been used in several prior works in this field [55-58]. VADER is a lexicon-based model that combines lexical scoring with heuristic rules to interpret sentiment in a given text. VADER works by parsing each word in a text and assigning it a valence score based on a predefined sentiment dictionary. Additionally, VADER accounts for common linguistic patterns that modify sentiment, such as intensifiers (e.g., \"very\"), negations, capitalization, punctuation, and emoticons. The output was a compound sentiment score - a composite measure capturing the overall sentiment of a text. This study used the compound sentiment score to classify videos into positive, negative, or neutral categories, with threshold values set to distinguish between the three classes. The toxicity analysis utilized Detoxify [59], a deep-learning model based on a transformer architecture. Detoxify is fine-tuned on a dataset annotated for toxic language, which enables it to detect multiple forms of toxicity, including hate speech, insults, and threats. Built on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model [60], Detoxify processes text by capturing the context and interdependence of words through self-attention layers, allowing it to learn relationships across entire text sequences.\""}, {"title": "IV.

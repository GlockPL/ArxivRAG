{"title": "No-brainer: Morphological Computation driven Adaptive Behavior in Soft Robots", "authors": ["Alican Mertan", "Nick Cheney"], "abstract": "It is prevalent in contemporary AI and robotics to separately postulate a brain modeled by neural networks and employ it to learn intelligent and adaptive behavior. While this method has worked very well for many types of tasks, it isn't the only type of intelligence that exists in nature. In this work, we study the ways in which intelligent behavior can be created without a separate and explicit brain for robot control, but rather solely as a result of the computation occurring within the physical body of a robot. Specifically, we show that adaptive and complex behavior can be created in voxel-based virtual soft robots by using simple reactive materials that actively change the shape of the robot, and thus its behavior, under different environmental cues. We demonstrate a proof of concept for the idea of closed-loop morphological computation, and show that in our implementation, it enables behavior mimicking logic gates, enabling us to demonstrate how such behaviors may be combined to build up more complex collective behaviors.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and Background", "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have benefited greatly from the rise of modern deep learning systems, ultimately aimed at artificial general intelligence [22]. The coming-of-age of these artificial neural network systems includes a long history of bio-inspiration, dating back to Mcculloch and Pitts [26]. Yet the processes behind biological intelligence reach far beyond systems and processes confined to the brain of living organisms.\nOur bias toward attributing intelligent behavior to the mind is far from new. Descartes' mind-body-dualism dates back to the 1600s [13]. However, Bongard warns that \"thinking about thinking is misleading\" [4]. Moravec's paradox, the observation that reasoning takes less computational resources than sensory-motor skills (contrary to the expectations of experts), is an example of how intuition could fail in introspection on thinking [30]. Examples of complex, perhaps intelligent-seeming, behavior stemming from non-neural processes are abound in both engineered and natural systems. Perhaps the most notable example of a system built to mimic a complex behavior in simple and purely mechanical form is the passive walking robot, which gracefully walks down an incline plane"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Simulation: We run our experiments on the EvoGym simulator [3]. It is a 2D soft robot simulator where robots are represented by voxels that can actuate by changing their areas ($a \\in [0.6 \\times r, 1.6 \\times r]$ where r is the resting area). Designing robots' bodies means placing voxels with varying materials in a grid layout and specifying connections with their neighbors. In our experiments, we assume all neighboring voxels are connected to simplify the design space.\nEnvironment: We use EvoGym's Python API to define a custom environment with two stimuli. These stimuli work in a binary fashion - they are either present or absent in the environment. For our robots to sense these stimuli and adapt their behavior, we hand-design \"sensory voxels\". We consider two environmental stimuli, each with one voxel type that expands in response to that stimuli and one that contracts in the presence of that stimuli for a total of 4 sensory voxel types (Fig. 1; green, red, magenta, blue). We also hand-designed two active voxels (orange and teal) that horizontally expand and contract to provide energy for locomotion following a sinusoidal signal with a 180\u00b0 phase offset, similar to the designs in [11], but do not provide any neural or informational connectivity between them to organize a coordinated controller by means other than physical forces traveling through the robot's body. Lastly, we provide evolution with two passive voxels, soft (gray) and rigid (black)."}, {"title": "Evolutionary algorithms", "content": "Evolutionary algorithms [14] are the most common approach to optimize robot body plans in the above-cited prior work, as they work by evaluating the empiric and holistic phenotype/behavioral effect of random mutations of a robot's artificial genome, selecting the most fit robots to survive and reproduce and thus do not require a differentiable model of the robot's morphology for credit assignment of the robot's fitness to individual voxels. Here we employ the Map-Elites algorithm [31] to evolve an archive of diverse robots. Specifically, the archive consists of seven feature dimensions. Three of these dimensions are based on morphological features - the number of active voxels, sensory voxels, and total number of voxels. Following the common practice [11], we limit the morphology space with a H \u00d7 W bounding box. Limiting the total number of voxels in this way allows us to discretize the three morphological dimensions of the archive into four bins each. The next four dimensions are based on the behavior of the robot, the direction of locomotion in the x-axis, under different stimuli patterns. The two binary stimuli result in four patterns, and a robot can move in either the positive x or the negative x direction, resulting in 16 possible behaviors in total. By utilizing QD algorithms and defining the dimensions of the archive in the described way, we allow evolution to search for all possible behaviors with varying morphological structures in a single run, and keep the best-performing robot for each unique combination of morphological-behavioral traits, via the MAP-Elites algorithm."}, {"title": "Evaluation and selection", "content": "Evaluation and selection: Individuals are evaluated under 5 simulated conditions. First, they are evaluated for 40 actuation cycles (i.e. 40 periods of the sinusoidal actuation signal) where at each 10th actuation cycle the environmental stimuli change as follows: (Stimulus 1, Stimulus 2) = {(Absent, Absent), (Absent, Present), (Present, Absent), (Present, Present)}. In the next 4 simulations, individuals are simulated under each of these 4 fixed stimuli patterns for 10 actuation cycles each. We use multi-objective selection to select robots that maximize total displacement in the 40-cycle variable stimuli simulation and maximize the minimum displacement across the 4 single stimuli 10-cycle simulations. Inspired from [25], an offspring replaces an individual from the archive, only if it dominates the individual, i.e. is better than the individual in both fitness values. In order to also select for robots with dynamically stable gaits that are not overly dependent on initial conditions, we disregard all robots that move in different directions for the same stimuli pattern in combined vs. single stimuli simulations."}, {"title": "Genome", "content": "Genome: Similar to [11,12], robot morphologies are represented by compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs) [37]. CPPN is a directed acyclic graph, where each node represents a math function. Here we use the sine, absolute value, square, and square-root as activation functions within each node. The CPPN takes the normalized coordinates of a voxel as well as its distance to the center of the bounding box as an input and outputs a scalar value for each possible voxel type, including the empty voxel. The type indicated by the max output value is assigned to the queried location. During evolution, offspring"}, {"title": "3 Responding to Binary Stimuli", "content": "Firstly we investigate whether purely morphological changes can result in behavior that adapts to environmental stimuli. Over the 4 stimuli patterns presented to the robot, our MAP-Elites archive collects different combinations of behavioral patterns that different morphologies produce (labeled for whether a robot moves (L)eft or (R)ight for each of the 4 stimuli). Fig. 2 visualizes the behavior of a robot exhibiting LRRL behavior as a spacetime diagram to investigate how"}, {"title": "4 Making a Swarm for More Complex Behavior", "content": "The above section demonstrated the evolution of robots exhibiting adaptive behavior in response to the two stimuli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a closed-loop fully-morphological behavior in evolved robots. The simplicity of the chosen behavior (more right or left) allows us to clearly see how shape change due to the stimuli-sensing materials affects the robots' behavior. But this also invites a thought experiment: how could this proof of concept scale to create complex \"intelligent\" behaviors from this simple framework?\nIn this section, we study how these robots can be grouped to create a swarm exhibiting more complex behavior. As a proof of concept, we use a subset of previously evolved robots and hand-design the swarm to show a certain behavior. We start with an observation. Given the binary nature of the stimuli and the possible behaviors of the robot (moving in a positive or negative direction on"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The above results demonstrate \"intelligent\" morphological computation that adapts the robot's behavior via stimuli-educed shape change rather than by a dedicated control or brain-like mechanism. While we feel that this proof of concept is an important, and hopefully entertaining, demonstration, we fully acknowledge that the most complex and adaptive behaviors in natural systems are not fully morphological, but are an interplay of embodied cognition connecting the body and the brain.\nRecent literature had demonstrated the challenges of brain-body co optimization and noted fragile co-adaptation to be a major challenge of evolving these systems [8,29], further suggesting that increasing the adaptability and robustness of the brain and body to modification in the other could result in less fragile and thus more effective brain-body systems [10,28]. We hope that by creating more intelligent and adaptive bodies, this work helps to open doors to transfer additional computation to the morphology and enable less fragile co-adaptation.\nLastly, we want to connect this research to recent ideas in artificial and natural evolution. Specifically, it has been argued that a key feature of natural evolution is that it works with material that is active. Cells that already have an array of functionalities come together to create multi-cellular structures, tissues, organs, and systems, creating a \"multiscale competence architecture\" where each scale exploits and regulates the already-existing functionalities of the scale below to achieve its goals [24]. This is considered to be an important feature of natural evolution and understanding/exploiting this in artificial evolution could have substantial effects [6,15]. Inspired by these ideas, here we show a first pass at demonstrating that simple materials each with straightforward behaviors can be optimized in their emergent design to result in a complex and adaptive system. In future work, we hope to examine how we can consider such a system as a substrate for further evolution (potentially in combination with separately postulated brain models)."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "We investigate ways in which complex, adaptive behavior can be created in virtual voxel-based soft robots without the use of a separately postulated brain. We hand-design simple muscle (that continuously expands and contracts) and sensory (that expands/shrinks in the presence or absence of a binary stimulus) voxel materials and show that evolution can create designs that exhibit closed-loop adaptive behavior, responding to two binary stimuli. Moreover, a swarm of such robots can exhibit even more complex behavior. In future work, we hope to study more ways of creating adaptive and complex behavior."}]}

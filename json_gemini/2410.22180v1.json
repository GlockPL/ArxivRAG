Introduction", "content": "Cancer remains one of the most significant global health challenges, with recent projections indicating 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths in the United States for 2024 [1]. Despite significant advancements in cancer research and treatment, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to improve patient outcomes and address persistent disparities in cancer care [2, 3]. Traditionally, cancer research has heavily relied on structured data and imaging techniques, such as histopathology and radiology [4, 5]. Advanced image processing and computer vision techniques have been applied to analyze medical imaging data to assist in early detection and accurate diagnosis of various cancers [6, 7]. While these techniques have produced useful results, they frequently fail to capture the rich, complex information contained in unstructured clinical text. Electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical notes contain extensive information about patient's medical histories, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes, providing a unique opportunity to gain a better understanding of cancer progression, treatment effectiveness, and patient experiences [8, 9].\nIn recent years, the application of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze EHRs and clinical notes has emerged as a promising field for advancing cancer research [10]. NLP techniques can automatically analyze large volumes of clinical text, identify relevant information, and generate structured data for further analysis [11]. This capability has the potential to revolutionize cancer research by enabling the extraction of valuable insights from enormous amounts of previously unexplored clinical data [12]. Moreover, by automating the analysis of unstructured clinical data, NLP can substantially reduce the costs and time associated with manual data review. This efficiency can expedite the review of extensive medical records and potentially identify early warning signs leading to earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Furthermore, by improving the accuracy of data extraction and analysis, NLP can enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient health outcomes.\nIn recent years, the application of NLP to analyze EHRs and clinical notes in cancer research has gained significant attention. However, compared to reviews on image processing and computer vision techniques for cancer research, very few reviews exist on NLP applications in cancer research. While recent studies have attempted to address this gap by exploring various aspects of NLP in cancer research they have primarily concentrated on specific areas or cancer types. For instance, Datta et al. [12] provided a frame semantic overview of NLP-based information extraction for cancer-related EHR notes, while Aggarwal and Pallavi [13] examined advancements and challenges in NLP for oral cancer research. Wang et al. [14] assessed EHRs for cancer research and patient care through a scoping review, and Gholipour et al. [15] systematically reviewed studies that applied NLP methods to identify cancer concepts from clinical notes. Additionally, Bitterman et al. [16] presented a review of clinical NLP for radiation oncology, and Sangariyavanich et al. [17] conducted a systematic review of NLP for recurrent cancer detection from electronic medical records.\nThe limitations attached to existing reviews highlight the need for a more comprehensive review that can provide valuable insights into various cancer types, NLP applications, techniques, datasets, and challenges. This review aims to address this gap by analyzing NLP applications in cancer research using EHRs and clinical notes, classifying studies based on different cancer types, discussing NLP techniques and applications, examining available datasets, and exploring open research challenges and future directions. This will give researchers and clinicians a broader understanding of the current state and potential future developments.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 details the methodology used in conducting this review. Section 3 provides a taxonomy and categorizes the studies by cancer type and research objective. Section 4 discusses the overall distribution of studies across different categories and journals highlighting trends in the number of publications, and identifying top-cited papers. Section 5 discusses the various NLP techniques and methodologies identified in the literature. Section 6 examines NLP-based datasets in cancer research, discussing their characteristics, availability, and potential for future research. Section 7 outlines open research challenges and future directions for NLP in cancer research. Lastly, Section 8 concludes this review with a summary of key findings and implications for future research."}, {"title": "2. Materials and Methods", "content": "This study conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the use of NLP techniques in analyzing EHRs for cancer research. The review focused on peer-reviewed articles published since 2019. The literature search was conducted using the \u201cScopus\u201d database. The search query was carefully created to capture relevant studies addressing the intersection of EHRS, cancer, and NLP. The search query included key terms such as \u201cElectronic Health Records\u201d. \u201cEHRs\u201d, \u201cClinical Notes\u201d, \u201cCancer\u201d, \u201cNatural Language Processing\u201d, and \u201cNLP\u201d. The query was structured to focus on these concepts within the title, abstract, and keywords of articles. The selection of studies for this review was guided by a set of predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included, studies had to be published in peer-reviewed journals since 2019, focusing specifically on the application of NLP techniques to EHRs or clinical notes in the context of cancer. Only articles written in English were considered. The review excluded conference papers, book chapters, reviews, and editorials to maintain a focus on primary research articles. Studies that did not directly address the use of NLP on EHR data for cancer research were also excluded. Additionally, articles published outside the specified time frame were not considered. These criteria were strictly applied throughout the screening process to ensure the inclusion of articles that specifically addressed the application of NLP techniques to EHRs or clinical notes in the context of cancer, published in reputable academic journals within the specified time frame.\nThe flow diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the selection process, clearly indicating the number of studies at each stage of screening and the reasons for exclusions. Initially, the Scopus database search identified 272 potentially relevant studies. After removing duplicate studies 255 articles underwent a preliminary screening based on titles and abstracts, resulting in 130 studies being considered for further review. Subsequently, 130 articles were attempted to be retrieved for full-text review, and 117 studies were successfully received for full-text evaluation. Finally, 94 studies were selected to be included in this review. This rigorous selection process ensured that only the most relevant and high-quality studies addressing the application of NLP to EHRs in cancer care were included in the final analysis.\nThis review was guided by key research questions focusing on the categorization of studies by cancer types, distribution of research across cancer categories, predominant NLP applications and techniques, NLP-based datasets, and current research challenges and future directions. For each selected study, we extracted a comprehensive set of data including study identifiers, characteristics, cancer-specific information, NLP-related details, dataset information, outcomes and performance metrics, reported challenges and limitations, and suggested future directions.

Taxonomy of NLP in Cancer Research", "content": "This section presents a taxonomy of NLP applications in cancer research, categorized based on a thorough review of research objectives and cancer types. Figure 2 provides a visual representation of the overall taxonomy. Moreover, studies that cover multiple cancer types are discussed separately in this section under \u201cMultiple Cancer Types", "Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Smart Virtual Assistant\" for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). The system aimed to automate clinical stage classification from free-text diagnostic reports, identify inconsistencies, support education, and integrate data-driven decision-making. Using EHRs of 96 LACC patients treated between 2015 and 2018, the system used NLP to analyze and categorize patient data from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gynecologic examination, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) reports. The virtual assistant successfully classified all patients in the training set and developed a predictive model for patient achieving 94% accuracy.\n3.4. Endocrine Cancers\nA study by Yoo et al. [90": "aimed to transform unstructured thyroid cancer diagnosis and staging information into the standardized OMOP CDM format. Using rule-based NLP on 52,133 surgical pathology reports and 56,239 iodine whole-body scan reports from three medical institutions, the researchers successfully converted the extracted data to OMOP CDM v6.0. Their findings revealed that papillary carcinoma was the most prevalent thyroid cancer type having 95.3-98.8%, with stage I accounting for 55-64% of cases and stage III representing 24-26%. The study achieved high precision and recall in the extraction and conversion process. Another study by Pathak et al. [91], focused on extracting thyroid nodule characteristics from ultrasound reports using transformer-based NLP methods. They compared five transformer models on a corpus of 490 reports from a dataset of 184,560 clinical notes. The GatorTron model, trained on over 90 billion words, demonstrated the best performance with strict and lenient F1-scores of 0.8851 and 0.9495 for characteristic extraction, and an F1-score of 0.9321 for linking characteristics to nodules. This research represents a pioneering effort in applying transformer-based NLP models to extract multiple thyroid nodule characteristics from ultrasound reports.\n3.5. Skin Cancers\nA couple of studies have demonstrated the potential of NLP for Skin cancer research. A study by Ali et al. [92], developed and validated an automated information extraction system for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) histopathology reports using the general architecture for text engineering (GATE) framework. The system achieved high performance across various metrics, including a mean Fl-score of 84.5%, when compared to expert human annotation. Moreover, a study by Malke et al. [93] focused on melanoma research, developing an efficient method to extract primary pathology features from pathology reports. This system was applied to a large dataset of 23,039 patients, generating over 368,000 individual melanoma data points. The algorithm achieved a 90.4% exact or synonymous match rate when compared to manually curated data, with a low error rate of 3.7%.\n3.6. Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancers\nSenders et al. [94] attempted to compare various NLP techniques for automatically quantifying brain metastases from free-text radiology reports. The researchers analyzed 1,479 MRI reports of patients diagnosed with brain metastases from two tertiary care centers. They developed and evaluated multiple bag-of-words and sequence-based NLP models to classify reports as indicating single or multiple metastases. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model performed best overall on the test set, achieving an AUROC of 0.92 and an accuracy of 83%. Among sequence-based models, a 1D CNN showed the highest performance. The study provides a framework for developing machine learning-based NLP models for medical text analysis and demonstrates their potential for automated extraction of clinically relevant information from radiology reports.\n3.7. Stage-Specific Categories\n3.7.1. Advanced Cancer\nExisting studies have highlighted the potential of NLP in improving data extraction and analysis in advanced cancer care for enhancing patient management and quality of care. Lindvall et al. [95] evaluated NLP for identifying advance care planning documentation in clinical notes of advanced cancer patients, achieving high accuracy with F1-scores ranging from 0.84 to 0.97 across various domains. This method proved significantly more time-efficient than manual chart review. Additionally, Lindvall et al. [96] aimed to use NLP to identify cancer patients receiving palliative gastrostomy and assess end-of-life quality indicators. The NLP approach demonstrated a high sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 97.4% in identifying patients with palliative indications, while also accurately assessing end-of-life process measures.\n3.7.2. Late-Stage / Stage IV Solid Tumor\nSeveral recent research has focused on leveraging NLP to improve patient identification and symptom management in late-stage or stage IV solid tumors. A study by Ernecoff et al. [97] developed and validated EHR phenotypes to identify patients with late-stage diseases, including stage 4 solid-tumor cancer. Their approach, utilizing international classification of diseases (ICD) codes, NLP, and laboratory values, achieved a high sensitivity of 99.5% and a positive predictive value of 68.6% for stage 4 cancer, demonstrating the potential for efficient patient identification and equitable distribution of palliative care. Based on computational techniques in oncology, DiMartino et al. [98] investigated the application of NLP to identify uncontrolled symptoms in hospitalized cancer patients with advanced disease. Using a Random Forest algorithm to analyze clinical notes, they developed models to predict uncontrolled pain, nausea/vomiting, and dyspnea, with varying levels of accuracy and sensitivity. The pain model performed better than the other models, achieving 61% accuracy and 69% sensitivity.\n3.8. Multiple Cancer Types\nA significant number of studies have explored the application of NLP techniques to analyze and extract valuable information from clinical data across various cancer types. Hochheiser et al. [31] developed DeepPhe-CR, an NLP system designed to help cancer registrars abstract case details from patient records, achieving high F1-scores for extracting key variables across multiple cancer types. Similarly, Harrison et al. [56] developed an NLP algorithm for interpreting pancreatic pathology reports, demonstrating high accuracy and potential for enhancing EHR coding. Seesaghur et al. [44] assessed the use of bone-targeting agents in patients with bone metastases from breast, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers using EHRs. Morin et al. [33] developed MEDomics, an artificial intelligence framework integrating longitudinal EHRs with real-world data for continuous pan-cancer prognostication, analyzing breast and lung cancer patients. In addition, symptom analysis and patient outcomes were the focus of several studies. Luo et al. [50] developed a computational framework to analyze symptom patterns in breast and colorectal cancer patients after chemotherapy. Kehl et al. [34] investigated the use of EHRs to identify cancer patients experiencing clinical inflection points across solid tumors and lymphoma. Luo et al. [52] analyzed symptoms in colorectal and breast cancer patients, examining the impact of type 2 diabetes comorbidity. Bhatt et al. [35] investigated the relationship between social support and outcomes in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.\nZhao et al. [76] proposed a framework for generating real-world evidence from unstructured clinical notes to examine the clinical utility of genetic tests in women's cancers. Do et al. [51] investigated patterns of metastatic disease in cancer patients using NLP of structured radiology reports. Shi et al. [53] developed an NLP pipeline to identify patients eligible for genetic testing for hereditary cancers based on family health history data in EHRs. Karimi et al. [58] created models to identify distant cancer recurrence and recurrence sites for breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Kehl et al. [36] developed deep NLP models to extract clinical outcomes from imaging reports and oncologist notes across various solid tumor types. Chen et al. [57] focused on extracting information about esophagitis presence and severity from clinical notes of patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung and esophageal cancers. Huang et al. [86] developed an NLP algorithm to extract clinical information from uro-oncological histopathology reports, covering prostate, bladder, and renal cancers. Additionally, few studies explored the extraction of temporal information and social determinants of health. Wang et al. [39] investigated the extraction of specific date information for lung cancer and multiple myeloma cases. Yu et al. [37] developed the SODA package to extract social determinants of health from clinical narratives, examining performance across different race and gender groups and testing generalizability using cancer and opioid use cohorts. Araki et al. [38] investigated the feasibility of evaluating treatment response in Japanese cancer patients using unstructured EHR data, focusing on lung and breast cancer patients. Furthermore, Huang et al. [32] evaluated ChatGPT's ability to extract structured data from clinical notes, focusing on lung cancer and pediatric osteosarcoma pathology reports.\n3.9. Unspecified Cancer Types\nSeveral studies have explored methods for extracting and classifying cancer-related information, where the specific cancer type was not the primary focus or was unspecified. A rule-based NLP algorithm was developed to automatically extract and categorize tumor response from radiology reports. The proposed algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 88% in classifying tumor response as progression or no progression [99]. Researchers have also created NLP tools to extract specific cancer-related information, such as PD-L1 expression levels from clinical notes [100] and physician-reported pain in radiation oncology consultation notes [101]. Advanced machine learning techniques, including transformers, have been employed to predict cancer treatment from EHRs [102]. Additionally, efforts have been made to improve the robustness of classification models for rare cancer types, with a study developing a novel class-specialized ensemble technique that outperformed other methods for rare cancer classification in pathology reports [103]. A study developed an algorithm to extract eastern cooperative oncology group performance status scores across 21 cancer types, improving score completeness from 60.4% to 73.2% with 93% accuracy when applied to a database of over 480,000 patient records [104]. A study has also explored the use of NLP and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to identify genomic mutation-associated treatment changes in cancer patient progress notes, with bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) performing best at 88.6% accuracy [106].\n3.10. Adverse Event\nExisting studies have also examined various kinds of adverse events associated with cancer and its treatment. A study on Japanese physicians' progress notes achieved high concordance rates for detecting gastrointestinal symptoms, with 83.5% accuracy for nausea/vomiting and 97.7% for diarrhea [107]. However, the study noted challenges in distinguishing between current symptoms and past medical history mentions. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a significant concern in cancer patients, has been addressed in multiple studies. A study developed a computable phenotype for incident VTE using a combination of ICD/medication-based and NLP-based algorithms [108]. This approach demonstrated high performance with a weighted sensitivity of 96% and a positive predictive value of 98%. Another study focused on predicting VTE recurrence in anticoagulated cancer patients, using various machine-learning algorithms on a large dataset from multiple Spanish hospitals [110]. The models achieved moderate predictive performance, with AUROC scores ranging from 0.66 to 0.69.\nThe extraction of common terminology criteria for adverse events (CT-CAE) symptoms from clinical notes has also been investigated. A study evaluated an NLP pipeline based on Apache clinical text analysis knowledge extraction system (cTAKES) and reported high accuracy for common symptoms in radiation therapy patients, such as radiation dermatitis, fatigue, and nausea [109]. However, the system faced challenges in detecting negated symptoms, highlighting an area for future improvement. Researchers have also explored the generalizability of machine learning methods in detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) from clinical narratives [111]. By comparing various machine learning and deep learning methods across different datasets, the study found that ClinicalBERT performed best, achieving F1-scores of 0.78 and 0.74 when tested on distinct datasets."}, {"title": "4. Discussion", "content": "The distribution of studies based on year demonstrates a notable trend over the past six years. As illustrated in Figure 3, there is a generally upward trajectory in the number of publications from 2019 to 2024. The year 2019 established a solid baseline for subsequent years. 2020 experienced a significant decrease in publications, which can be attributed to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number of studies increased significantly in 2021, returning to pre-pandemic levels. A marked increase is observed in 2023, indicating growing interest and investment in this research area. Even though the publication data only covers the starting months of 2024, it already indicates encouraging progress and is expected to surpass previous years.\nFigure 4 illustrates the distribution of publications on NLP for cancer research across top journals from 2019 to 2024. JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics leads with 13 publications, demonstrating its significant role in this field. Three journals follow with 4 publications each: BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making, International Journal of Medical Informatics, and Journal of Biomedical Informatics. JAMIA Open, BMC Medical Research Methodology, and AMIA Annual Symposium proceedings each contribute 3 publications. Figure 5 illustrates the Top 10 journals by citation count based on studies included in this review.\nTable 1 presents the top 10 most cited papers in the field of NLP for cancer research. These citation data reflects the number of citations up to the first quarter of 2024. The most cited paper [96], published in 2019, has accumulated 54 citations and explores the use of NLP to assess end-of-life quality indicators in cancer patients undergoing palliative surgery. Other highly cited works include studies on pan-cancer prognostication [33], social isolation identification [84], and automatic trial eligibility surveillance [74]. This also highlights emerging research areas such as cancer-specific language models [60] and the application of NLP in identifying advance care planning documentation [95].\nThe analysis of NLP-based studies utilizing EHRs and clinical notes reveals a diverse distribution of cancer types, with some categories receiving more attention than others. Respiratory cancers, particularly lung cancer, were prominently featured in 22 studies, with an additional 5 studies specifically focusing on NSCLC. Gastrointestinal cancers were also well-represented, with colorectal cancer being the subject of 13 studies, followed by pancreatic cancer (5 studies), and esophageal cancer (3 studies). Among reproductive system cancers, breast cancer emerged as the most frequently studied type, with 29 studies dedicated to this area. Prostate cancer and ovarian cancer followed with 14 and 6 studies, respectively. Other cancer types, such as endocrine, skin, CNS, hematological, and bone cancers, were the focus of fewer studies, typically ranging from 1 to 2 per specific subtype. The analysis also included studies on stage-specific categories, unspecified cancer types, and adverse events related to cancer treatment. This distribution presented in Figure 6 highlights the current research priorities in applying NLP techniques to cancer-related EHRs and clinical notes, while also indicating potential areas for future exploration in less-studied cancer types."}, {"title": "5.

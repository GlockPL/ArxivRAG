In this scenario, we experience an unprecedented increase in the scale and complexity of interactions and, at the same time, little to no research about some fringe social platforms. In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional framework for characterizing nodes and hyperedges in social hypernetworks, with a focus on the understudied alt-right platform Scored.co. Our approach integrates the possibility of studying higher-order interactions, thanks to the hypernetwork representation, and various node features such as user activity, sentiment, and toxicity, with the aim to define distinct user archetypes and understand their roles within the network. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from Scored.co, we analyze the dynamics of these archetypes over time and explore their interactions and influence within the community. The framework's versatility allows for detailed analysis of both individual user behaviors and broader social structures. Our findings highlight the importance of higher-order interactions in understanding social dynamics, offering new insights into the roles and behaviors that emerge in complex online environments.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the last decades, the proliferation of social platforms and the opportunities tied to each of them have drastically transformed the way individuals interact, share information, and form communities. This unprecedented growth in the scale and complexity of online interactions is largely due to social networks like X (formerly known as Twitter), discussion fora like Reddit, and even more niche platforms, like the now-defunct Voat, known for their explorations of censorship-free models from the point of view of specific political groups [29]. Hence, understanding user behavior within these platforms has become a crucial area of research in computational social science [26]. By studying how users interact with each other and with others' content, researchers can uncover patterns of influence spread, opinion formation, and creation and dissolution of communities [14]. These insights are not only academically interesting but also have practical implications for designing better social platforms, enhancing user experience, and mitigating issues such as misinformation and online harassment. Moreover, understanding these behaviors can aid in developing strategies for marketing, public health campaigns, and even political mobilization, making this research area highly relevant in multiple domains. Furthermore, all of these aspects are even more critical in the analysis of understudied platforms. Indeed, platforms such as Scored.co [34]\u00b9, which have not been extensively explored, offer unique social dynamics that may differ significantly from \u201cmainstream\u201d platforms. Investigating these less-explored environments can uncover novel patterns of user behavior and mechanisms of information dissemination. Also, understudied platforms often cater to niche communities or specialized interests, thus providing insights into subcultures and micro-level social dynamics that might not be straightforwardly visible on larger social platforms.\nUnderstanding these dynamics becomes particularly important when addressing the general challenges inherent in studying complex social platforms. Among all of these, a significant one is the identification of roles that users play within complex social structures. Indeed, role identification is crucial for various applications, including targeted information dissemination [47] and community detection [10]. In traditional social network analysis, roles are often determined based on patterns of dyadic connectivity and interactions. Nevertheless, in a discussion on a social platform, two users can interact directly, e.g., by sharing comments, but also indirectly, i.e., through other users."}, {"title": "Related Literature", "content": "Hence, it is fair to assume that taking into account group dynamics and higher-order interactions could help in a more reliable identification of the roles played by users. A promising approach to encapsulate group interactions is defined by the concept of a social hypernetwork [1,5,15], which allows for the modeling of relationships among groups of nodes, generally called hyperedges. Such a representation is particularly useful for studying social platforms from a higher-order point of view. Despite its importance and the existing methodologies designed for pairwise graphs, current literature about the problem of role identification lacks comprehensive approaches for social hypernetworks.\nTo address this gap, in this work, we formally introduce an approach for defining higher-order roles in a social hypernetwork and characterize higher-order interactions. We define the concept of an archetype, a general characterization of higher-order roles that serves as a \"template\" for identifying nodes representative of specific roles within the context of hyperedges. These archetypes provide a structured way to categorize and understand the diverse roles users play in group interactions. Then, we propose a general hyperedge characterization function, which allows one to characterize a hyperedge w.r.t. features of the nodes contained in it.\nTo validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct an exhaustive experimental campaign on the understudied social platform Scored.co, which offers a rich, yet understudied dataset for analyzing user interactions in a hypernetwork context, making it an ideal testbed for our framework. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our approach in characterizing user roles within social hypernetworks.\nSummarizing, the main contributions of this work are as follows:\n\u2022 We define the concept of archetype, that is, a high-level description of user roles that serves as a \"template\" characterizing nodes representatives;\n\u2022 We introduce an approach to characterize higher-order entities, such as hyperedges, taking into account exhibited features and their higher-order dynamics;\n\u2022 We design an exhaustive experimental evaluation in which we assess the effectiveness of our framework on the understudied social platform Scored.co. Notably, this is also the first work studying the structural properties of Scored.co.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: in the Related Literature section, we provide a detailed overview of related literature. In the Materials and methods section, we provide the formalization of our proposed approach by defining the concept of archetype first, and the hyperedge characterization function after. In the Experiments section, we illustrate the experimental campaign we carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. Finally, in the Conclusion section, we draw our conclusions and delineate some future works."}, {"title": "Hypernetworks and Role Identification", "content": "The identification of roles within social networks stands as a fundamental aspect for understanding the dynamics and function of these complex systems [39]. In traditional social network analysis, roles are often determined based on patterns of connectivity that provide insights into the influence, responsibilities, and grouping of individuals within the network [2]. This analysis is crucial for applications ranging from the characterization of polarization [37] and user behaviors [11] to the analysis of biological networks [43] and animal populations [3]. In different cases, role identification is also framed within the task of discovering influential users in a social network. In light of this, we refer the interested reader to the comprehensive survey proposed in [2].\nNevertheless, extending role identification into hypernetwork scenarios poses many challenges. Unlike traditional networks, hypernetworks consist of interactions, represented by hyperedges, that can encompass multiple nodes simultaneously. Higher-order interaction models can better represent complex real-world systems [5,42]; however, the complexity of higher-order interactions can introduce difficulties in accurately defining and identifying roles, as traditional centrality metrics and methodologies (e.g., community detection algorithms) often fall short in capturing the multidimensional nature of hyperedges [7, 32, 39]. Despite the relevance of such a task, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing papers that explicitly discuss role identification within the context of hypernetworks.\nGiven this gap in the literature, the rest of the section will concentrate on providing an overview of the methodologies and findings from the conventional settings in dyadic interactions, which may serve as a baseline for future exploration into hypernetwork-specific role identification."}, {"title": "Role Identification in Pairwise Networks", "content": "The general task of role identification consists in capturing the multifaceted characteristics of a node's role in a pairwise network. The work in [22] identifies roles in undirected, unweighted networks by evaluating node importance using correlated indicators like degree and centrality measures. A node's role is then determined by comparing its indicator relationships to statistical correlations within the overall network. While this work shares the task of role identification with ours, the process does not involve group-based indicators leveraging the concept of \"groups\" such as communities or subgraphs. The work in [6] frames the node role identification tasks as a node classification approach based on random walks. Similarly, framed within a classification tasks, the authors in [9] focus on the so-called \u201canswer-person\" role on Reddit, characterized by users who predominantly respond to questions posed by others, with minimal engagement in broader discussions. Both the works in [6] and [9] share a similar aim with ours. Nevertheless, they rely on supervised approaches on pairwise graphs. Also, the methods might not be straightforwardly generalized to higher-order interactions.\nThe approach proposed in [8] focuses on the identification of node roles in dynamic social networks as a sequence of different types of activities, by leveraging pattern subgraphs and sequence diagrams. Doing so, the authors are able to capture roles such as the \u201cgossipmongers\u201d, i.e., users who replicate every received message at least three times. The work in [8] can be considered as orthogonal to ours, as an hypergraph mining approach could also be applied in our context to enhance role identification. The authors in [18] outline a process for identifying user roles in Enterprise Social Networks (ESNs), using a mix of design science research and data mining, involving data collection, preparation, and evaluation, with user roles identified through statistical analysis, including PCA and clustering. The work in [18] shares a similar focus with ours, although using a different methodology. The identification of emergent leadership roles is addressed in [41], where the authors examine collaboration patterns between teams and propose the so-called \"leadership index\u201d, a combination of centrality measures including closeness and betweenness. In [47], the authors propose a mixed-methods methodology for user role identification, focusing on dynamic user profiling. Several types of special users are defined and identified to support information dissemination. The work in [47] proposes an approach based on computational methods and questionnaire-based evaluation to quantitatively describe user features. Such work parallels ours in the sense that it considers the network's features, too. In [10], the authors study community and user stereotypes in Reddit. Here, with the term stereotype, the authors refer to the tendency to classify people into groups and to associate each group with a general idea or a label. The authors propose a rule-based approach based on different quantitative views of the data, and define author stereotypes on the basis of two orthogonal taxonomies, namely, the number of posts, and the number of comments of an author. While the work in [10] and ours share some similarities, the employed methodologies are substantially different. The former defines stereotypes based on a single quantitative measure called score, which is inherent to the social platform itself. Instead, our approach proposes a general framework in which the characterization of users and the identification of their role are both defined by their feature-rich, higher-order surroundings. In [25], the authors identify five distinct social roles in a specific community on Reddit. Among them, we cite the \u201cknowledge broker\u201d, i.e., a member who introduces knowledge to the community by sharing links, and the \"translator\u201d, i.e., a member who contributes academic knowledge. While the contribution in [25] is notable and similar to ours for considering various aspects of user characterization, these roles are specific and applicable only to the analyzed community.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning embedding-based methodologies [46], which could potentially be adapted to hypernetwork scenarios. For instance, in [38], the authors introduce a technique that incorporates node attributes to generate embeddings that capture the similarities based on neighborhood structures. Instead, in [13], the authors leverage both node and structural embeddings to detect nodes impersonating social bots. Indeed, node embeddings based on structural properties and exhibited attributes attracted substantial interest in the last years [24]. While these methods use embedding techniques that effectively summarize and exploit the structural information within traditional networks, their application to hypernetworks might not be straightforward. Our approach diverges from embedding-based methods in the sense that it is specifically tailored to the unique features of nodes within hypernetworks, such as their exhibited features w.r.t. the hyperedges containing them. By focusing on this, without relying on an embedding, our methodology seeks to offer a more direct and fitting analysis of node roles."}, {"title": "\"Understudied\" Social Platforms", "content": "We conclude this bird's-eye view of the related literature by focusing on the last contribution of our paper, that is the study of an understudied platform. Indeed, the reasoning provided in the above discussion of related work is also valid for this aspect. In fact, there is a moderate number of works on understudied platforms, and generally these are limited to present a dataset collection about the considered platform [17, 28, 34, 36]. For instance, a large-scale dataset of the social platform Scored.co has been presented in [34], in which the authors studied aspects such as posting activity and user characterization, as well as the phenomenon of user migration from other platforms. A recent social platform, called Bluesky, has been studied in [17,36].

A visual representation of a hypergraph is depicted in Fig. 1. The order of H is $n = |V|$, while the size of H is $m = |E|$. We denote with $E_{v_i}$ the set of hyperedges containing $v_i$, that is\n$E_{v_i} = {e_j \\in E : v_i \\in e_j}$. Given a hyperedge $e_j \\in E$, its size is the number of nodes belonging to it, that is $|e_j|$. The degree of a node $v_i$, denoted as $deg(v_i)$, is the number of neighbors of $v_i$; a node $v_k \\in V$ is the neighbor of node $v_i$ if and only if there exists at least one hyperedge $e_j$ which $v_i$ and $v_k$ both belong to. The hyperdegree of a node $v_i$, denoted as $hdeg(v_i)$, is the number of hyperedges to which $v_i$ belongs. A graphical depiction of a hypergraph is given in Fig. 1.\nWe use a hypergraph H to model a social hypernetwork. Here, nodes are users of the social hypernetwork, while a hyperedge represents a discussion between users. In what follows, we will refer to the social hypernetwork simply as hypernetwork.\nMoreover, features can be associated with users, and these are generally based on the content the users interact with and the discussions they participate in. To formalize them, we employ a set of features $F = {f_1, ..., f_l}$ characterizing the nodes in H. Given a node $v_i \\in V$, $F_{v_i} = {f_{1_{v_i}}, ..., f_{l_{v_i}} }$ represents the values of each feature of $v_i$, that is $f_{k_{v_i}}$ indicates the value of the k-th feature of $v_i$.

By leveraging well-established psychological theories and lexicons, we aim to create detailed profiles that reflect the peculiar ways in which users interact and participate within the social platform. In what follows, we describe in detail these three expressions, which we will subsequently use in our experiments.\nEmotional Profiles We aim to characterize archetypes based on the emotions they express. To do so, we refer to the psychological theory of emotions [35] developed in 1980 by the American psychologist Robert Plutchik. This theory identifies eight basic emotions \u2013 joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, anticipation, anger, and disgust \u2014 and"}, {"title": "Analyzing Higher-Order Entities", "content": "While archetypes are a particular yet effective way to analyze entities within the social platform, they mainly focus on the node features, whereas interactions are not taken into account. Hence, we define here a general characterization function to characterize nodes and hyperedges according to their exhibited features and higher-order dynamics. Without loss of generality, we propose the definition of such a function w.r.t. hyperedges. The same can be also applied to nodes.\nLet $H_F = (V, E)$ be a hypergraph equipped with the node features set F. We denote with $\\omega$ a function which we call the hyperedge characterization function. The need for a function such as $\\omega$ addresses the challenge of characterizing a hyperedge w.r.t. the nodes contained in it. Let us recall that our approach deals with analyzing higher-order entities. To do so, we exploit the representation of node relationships via hyperedges. While it effectively captures the higher-order structural interactions between nodes, it might not be sufficient in acquiring insights into the semantics of such interactions. Therefore, we focus on the latter aspect through a characterization of hyperedges that is based not only on the contained nodes but also on their features. Formally, the domain of our hyperedge characterization function is E. $\\omega$ takes in input a hyperedge $e_j \\in E$ and returns a value $\\omega(e_j)$, which we call its characteristic value. Such value depends on the actual implementation $\\omega$: in fact, $\\omega$ is general, and different approaches can be exploited to accommodate the hyperedge characterization. Furthermore, to address the aforementioned challenge, there are cases in which $\\omega$ should be defined to consider the values of each node's features contained in the considered hyperedge. Given a feature of interest $f_k$, we write $\\omega^{f_k}$ to denote that the actual implementation of $\\omega$ considers the feature $f_k$.\nIn the following, we propose various specializations of $\\omega$ and a brief rationale for each of them. Some of these specializations are used in the Experiments section. We separate them in three families, namely, (i) numerical-only definitions, (ii) categorical-only, (iii) structural-based ones. In describing each of them, we assume we are interested in characterizing a hyperedge $e \\in E$. Also, there are different specializations that are intended to be exploited when"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "In this section, we present an experimental evaluation carried out to assess the efficacy of our framework.

Then, we focus on the constructed hypernetworks, and we provide a characterization of discussions, that is, hyperedges, through our proposed hyperedge characterization function."}, {"title": "Dataset", "content": "We focus on the Scored.co social platform, which hosts a network of communities that users can create and join. The platform shares different similarities with the more common platform Reddit\u00b3. Users can join communities related to various topics, from politics to memes, and upvote content they like, and downvote content they dislike. The number of upvotes minus the downvotes constitutes a post's score, i.e., a value that indicates the content's usefulness and/or relevance to the discussion.\nInterestingly, Scored.co acted as a shelter for many far-right/alt-right communities after the 2020 massive Reddit bans [12]. Some of these maintained their names and key figures, e.g., c/TheDonald, c/GreatAwakening, ultimately acting as a continuation of the original ones. This platform has allowed users to freely share their views without the risk of being banned. Scored.co is an emerging yet understudied platform, potentially hosting dangerous content. Despite its growing user base, it has received relatively little academic attention compared to other social media platforms, as we pointed out in the Related Literature section. The loosely moderated nature of some communities can lead to the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and radical ideologies. This makes Scored.co a platform of interest for researchers studying online extremism, digital sociology, and the impacts of social media on public discourse.\nTo build the dataset our experiments are carried out on, we collect data from the Scored.co platform via the official API4. To retrieve as much content as possible, we use a breadth-first search technique by first gathering all posts and comments authored by C, one of the platform's admins, which is one of the most active users on the platform. Then, the content is parsed to retrieve other users and their related content. We repeat this procedure until no new user is found. Eventually, we find 207,554 unique users (referenced to by their username), 4,398,074 posts, and 36,978,685 comments. Our data collection process started on June 9th, 2024, and ended on June 22nd, 2024. The final dataset comprises higher-order interactions on Scored.co starting from the platform's launch on October 15th, 2019, and ending on June 1st, 2024.\nTo improve reproducibility and share our findings, we release the dataset on Zenodo [16]. The dataset is anonymized and provides:\n\u2022 Higher-order interactions extracted from discussion threads. Each thread/hyperedge is labeled with the community it is extracted from (e.g. c/TheDonald), and the year and month when the root post was created;\n\u2022 User profiles, namely a set of features characterizing each user at every time stamp.\nA Python data collection script is also enclosed in the repository. In the first release of this dataset, only user/thread data leveraged in this study is shared (i.e., 2023 data from the C/THEDONALD community, see next section). However, we plan to update it in the near future to include statistics and interactions for all users, leveraging Zenodo's versioning system. Our dataset complies with the fair guidelines for data sharing [44], which are as follows:\n1. Findable. We release the data on Zenodo 5, a service managed by CERN that also assigns a DOI to the repository, ensuring findability. Moreover, we indexed it also on the SoBigData Research Infrastructure (URL: http://sobigdata.eu/), an EU-funded RI providing curated datasets and algorithms advocating open science;\n2. Accessible. The dataset is freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection;\n3. Interoperable. All data is released in CSV files, which can be read and manipulated with most programming languages;\n4.

That is, a user $v$ appears in V if they participate in at least one discussion.

This community is a controversial and highly active online group that originally formed on Reddit before migrating to platforms like Scored.co [12]. We chose it because it is the oldest and most active community on the platform, covering 74% of all collected posts and comments. This allows us to maintain topic continuity without sacrificing large portions of the data. Note that H is a hypernetwork that represents the whole dataset. To enable analyses on the time dimension, we construct a hypergraph $H_t = (V_t, E_t)$, for each month $t = 1, ..., 12$, containing users and discussions relative to month t.\nIn Table 1, we report summary statistics of all the constructed hypernetworks. The table reports basic statics, such as nodes and hyperedges number |V| and |E|, respectively, the largest hyperedge size $max_{|e|}$, the average hyperdegree $hdeg$, and the average degree $deg$. Also, for each pair of adjacent timestamps $1 < t, t+1 < 12$, we report the Jaccard similarity index between node sets. The last row of the table reports the same information for the hypernetwork H.\nWe recall that a core aspect of our approach relies on identifying archetypes, namely typical patterns that can give us approximate descriptions of individual element behaviors.

Therefore, henceforth we refer to archetypes as related to nodes/users."}, {"title": "Archetype Characterization", "content": "To define user archetypes, we combine platform-specific and linguistic features. Specifically, we outline eight archetypes based on these features and their values. The features we decide to use are, namely, (i) score, (ii) sentiment, and (iii) toxicity. As far as the score is regarded, we compute the average post score for each user, then we normalize values in [0, 1]. For the sentiment feature, we use the well-known VADER algorithm [23], a rule-based sentiment classifier that assigns each text positive, negative, neutral, and compound sentiment intensity values. Out of these, the compound sentiment is a score in [-1,1] going from the most extreme negative (-1) to the most extreme positive (1) sentiment. For our purposes, we compute the average compound scores for each user and rescale values in [0, 1]. Moreover, for the toxicity feature, we compute its values with Detoxify [20], a neural toxicity detection model that returns the probability that a text contains toxic language, and also in this case, we normalize the obtained values. Finally, to discern between high and low values for each feature, we set a threshold of 0.5, such that when a feature has a value higher than this threshold, it is considered high, and vice-versa.\nThe list of the eight archetypes defined is depicted in Table 2. Here, we can observe how setting the various combinations of the state of a feature (high or low) creates different archetypes. We defined these archetypes in order to encapsulate the inherent semantics of the discussions taking place in the studied dataset. For instance, the first row is the so-called Community Hero, which represents users who consistently contribute positively to the discussion by maintaining a positive and supportive attitude without engaging in toxic behavior. A detailed characterization of these archetypes is given in the following section.\nHaving defined the archetypes, we are now able to provide a characterization of them, based on multiple psychological and social dimensions. More in detail, we describe the behaviors of these types with respect to the different aspects highlighted in the section.

By analyzing these transitions, we can gain insights into how user behaviors evolve over time. This analysis not only helps in understanding the fluidity of user roles but also potentially provides valuable information for targeted interventions and community management.\nIn order to carry out this analysis, we propose the following methodology. Given the imbalanced class sizes (see Table 2) throughout the observation periods, we employ a null model to test the transition probabilities between archetypes. This null model computes the expected transition probabilities on a copy of our dataset where archetype labels are shuffled. The detailed steps are as follows:\n1. We generate N = 500 shuffled copies of the dataset, randomizing the archetype labels while preserving the overall distribution of interactions and activities;\n2. For each archetype pair (A, B) in the shuffled copies we compute the transition probability $P(B|A)$, which represents the likelihood of a user transitioning from archetype A to archetype B;\n3. We calculate the mean and standard deviation of $P(B|A)$ across all shuffled copies. These statistics are used to compute z-scores and p-values for the observed transition probabilities in the original dataset;\n4.

To address this issue, we introduce a self-curation method that preprocesses annotated datasets by leveraging proxy models trained directly on these datasets. Our method enhances preference learning by automatically detecting and removing ambiguous annotations within the dataset. The proposed approach is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating a marked improvement in performance across various instruction-following tasks.

While linguistic ambiguity can enhance human communication through flexible and context-dependent interpretations (Piantadosi et al., 2012), it remains challenging for language models (LMs) to recognize different readings of ambiguous text (Liu et al., 2023). This characteristic of language is particularly pronounced in preference datasets when collecting and creating paired corpora for prompts. Preference datasets, consisting of chosen and rejected responses to given prompts, are used to enhance instruction following in LMs via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Leike et al., 2018; Ziegler et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022b; Touvron et al., 2023) or its prominent successor, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The variability in comprehension due to linguistic ambiguity leads to inconsistent preferences among annotators. Even within the same crowd, decisions can range from unanimous to narrowly split. To mitigate the challenges posed by such inconsistent datasets, manual data cleansing or adding annotations on the significance level of each preference data point can be used (Touvron et al., 2023). However, these approaches are costly and time-consuming. Similar issues can arise when using LLMs for annotation. Chen et al. (2024) noted that GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) often exhibits inconsistent behavior during multi-step reasoning despite its impressive performance on various tasks.\nIn this work, we aim to establish methods for curating training corpora that contain inconsistencies in a fully automated manner. Our self-curation method leverages proxy models based on either the target LM or other suitable LMs. These proxy models are initialized with pretrained checkpoints, augmented with regression heads, and trained on the given preference datasets using ranking loss. Through this training process, consistent preference patterns emerge, allowing the trained proxy to retrospectively evaluate the original dataset to assess the consistency of the annotations."}, {"title": "We examine preference discrepancies between the proxy models' predictions and the targeted annotations as illustrated in Fig. 1. These conflicts suggest that their ambiguity is difficult for the target LM to comprehend, making such corpora detrimental to preference learning. We demonstrate that simply excluding these discrepant instances from training can significantly enhance preference learning such as DPO. This is evidenced by improved performance in instruction-following evaluations.  Our key contributions are summarized as follows:", "content": "\u2022 We reveal preference discrepancy between given annotations and proxy predictions by leveraging the preference training data itself.\n\u2022 Through comprehensive analyses, we show that inverted preference data negatively impact preference learning such as DPO.\n\u2022 We propose a novel self-curation method that excludes training data with inverted preference during preference learning.\n\u2022 We empirically demonstrate that applying the proposed self-curation method improves preference learning performance by a large margin through extensive experiments."}, {"title": "2 Preliminary", "content": "Proxy Modeling In LM literature, reward modeling is often based on Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley and Terry, 1952) that produces preference probability by leveraging the point-wise reward of each of paired responses. This idea leads to an objective that maximizes the following ranking loss:\n$\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y_c,y_r)\\sim D} [\\log \\sigma (r^{\\prime}(y_c; x) \u2013 r^{\\prime}(y_r;x))]$, (1)\nwhere $r^{\\prime}$ is the reward model we train, and $(x, y_c, y_r)$ denote a prompt and its paired responses.\nDPO While both RLHF and DPO variants train LMs on human preferences, DPO optimizes them directly as an LM policy without reward modeling. By rearranging an optimal policy solution of the PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) objective, DPO derives a supervised training loss to maximize:\n$\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y_c,y_r)\\sim D} [\\log \\sigma (r_{\\theta}(y_c; x) \u2013 r_{\\theta}(y_r;x))]$, (2)\nwhere $r_{\\theta}(y; x)$ is an implicit reward function defined as $\\beta \\log \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(y|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y|x)}$. $\\pi_{\\theta}$ and $\\pi_{ref}$ denote policies of the target LM and the reference LM, respectively."}, {"title": "3 Preference Discrepancy", "content": "Ambiguity in preference datasets is common, whether annotated by humans or LMs, due to unclear criteria and difficulty in articulating reasons for preferences (see Fig. 11 in Appendix). Our initial goal is to identify these ambiguous data using autonomously determined criteria. To this end, we employ proxy models trained on the target or similar in-distribution datasets using Eq. 1.\nSuch proxy models can predict consistent rewards based on preference patterns learned from the dataset, potentially mismatching some highly ambiguous annotations. By comparing reward differences between proxy predictions (blue) and given annotations (orange) as shown in Fig. 2, we can identify inverted preference data, that are often quite prevalent. These inverted data are detected automatically by estimating the reward difference between chosen and rejected responses.\nTo investigate the impact of these discrepancies on DPO training, we conduct two separate trainings on data with or without discrepancies in UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023). As 17.1K instances (27.9%) have preference discrepancies, we sample an equal amount of matched preference data for fair comparison. In the GPT-4 evaluation for each model's generations, the model trained on inverted preference data performs significantly worse than the one trained on matched data as shown in Table 1.\nThese observations indicate that data with preference discrepancy negatively impact on preference learning. More details are given in Appendix B.4."}, {"title": "4 Self-Curation", "content": "Based on the discussion in Sec. 3, we propose a self-curation method for a preference dataset $D_p$. Our method screens out detrimental preference data with non-positive reward differences identified by the trained proxy. The self-curation procedure consists of: (1) training a proxy model using $D_p$, (2) estimating rewards of $D_p$ instances, and (3) excluding inverted preference data as illustrated in Fig. 1. After completing these steps, the remaining subset $D_c$ becomes the self-curated dataset (Algorithm 1).\nSetup We evaluate the effectiveness of our self-curation on extensive preference datasets using the Llama 2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023). Following Rafailov et al. (2023), we first conduct supervised finetuning with their prompts and chosen responses (preferred-FT) to boost DPO training. During DPO, we apply LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) for efficiency. Experimental details are provided in Appendix B.\nWe train the preferred-FT model on the subset $D_c$ and the original dataset $D_p$ using DPO objective (Eq. 2). Both trained models are compared using the prompts from the held-out dataset. Once the generated responses from both models are evaluated, we report a win score as the performance metric, similar to Wang et al. (2023). To assess the effect on generalized instruction-following capability of our method, we additionally conduct MT and Vicuna benches (Zheng et al., 2023a) test.\nResult Self-curation significantly enhances DPO performance across all settings compared to no curation as shown in Table 2. Our method also consistently improves performance for datasets annotated by both humans and LLMs while remaining effective across different preference datasets with distinct characteristics. Particularly in the Anthropic-HH setting, where Helpfulness and Harmlessness datasets are mixed, the resulting model surpasses its baseline (no curation) in both helpfulness-only (the 2nd column) and harmlessness-only (the 5th column) evaluations. We note self-curated subsets for Anthropic-Helpful and Anthropic-Harmless are obtained with their respective proxy models.\nMT and Vicuna benches yield slightly lower performances as shown in Table 3, compared to in-distribution evaluation (Table 2). However, despite both benches aiming to evaluate general instruction following across diverse categories that may differ from the training distribution, our method outperforms DPO without curation in most settings. This demonstrates that the preferences learned through self-curation are also beneficial for generalization.\nThis significant and consistent improvement suggests that our method allows models to learn from less ambiguous thus more beneficial data during preference learning even with less training data. For further details, refer to Appendix B.5."}, {"title": "5 Analysis and Discussion", "content": "Data Scale Impact We analyze the impact of the dataset scale on self-curation by adding a subset of 5K instances incrementally. As shown in Fig. 4, applying self-curation in each subset quickly reaches peak performance in the early stage, while the baseline (no curation) improves slowly and plateaus at a lower level. For details, refer to Appendix B.6\nImproved Self-Curation Criteria Even data with positive reward differences can be ambiguous when these values are close to zero. We investigate the effect of using thresholds larger than zero for self-curation with Anthropic-Helpful and UltraFeedback. By removing the bottom portion from the smallest positive reward difference, we perform simple grid search (Fig. 5). While our basic threshold of zero is straightforward and effective, additional exclusion (~10%) leads to near-peak performance for both datasets, implying a better threshold can exist. We reserve more research on this issue for future work (Appendix B.7).\nGeneralized Proxy Once a single generalized proxy model is trained, it can be used repeatedly for various purposes. This approach eliminates the need to train separate proxies for each individual task, including our self-curation. Experiments to verify its feasibility are provided in Appendix B.8."}, {"title": "6 Related Work", "content": "Reward modeling is primarily used for RLHF in the LM context. Ziegler et al. (2020) assumed that evaluating outcomes is simpler than generating correct behaviors. Ouyang et al. (2022), Glaese et al. (2022) and Bai et al. (2022b) fine-tuned pre-trained LMs as reward models on preference datasets using the popular BT model (Bradley and Terry, 1952) to involve them in the RL framework.\nNotable preference learning approaches include RLHF and DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). Whereas RLHF leverages reward models to enhance instruction following in LMs, DPO utilizes an implicit reward model derived from the PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) objective, aligning LMs to preference datasets in a supervised manner."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we addressed the inherent challenges of linguistic ambiguity in preference learning for LMs. We proposed a straightforward and reliable self-curation method that leverages proxy models to identify and exclude data with preference discrepancies. Our approach significantly and consistently enhances DPO training performance in an entirely automated fashion. The efficacy and robustness of our method were validated across diverse instruction-following tasks, highlighting its potential for further refinement of preference learning procedures for LMs."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "In this work, we propose a simple yet effective self-curation method for training datasets to enhance preference learning in language models. While we demonstrated significant and consistent performance improvement with a basic threshold (X=0) in the proposed method, there might be better thresholds as discussed in Sec. 5 and Appendix B.7. Finding a theoretically-grounded optimal threshold is left for exciting future work.\nConsidering prior research that suggests GPT-4's evaluations generally align with human evaluations (Bubeck et al., 2023), we employed GPT-4 as a judge for comparative evaluations of responses to instructions. We took steps to mitigate potential biases in GPT-4, such as swapping response positions and conducting evaluations twice per pair to counteract reported position bias of GPT-4 (Zheng et al., 2023b), and utilized sophisticated evaluation prompting to obtain more reliable results as presented in Appendix C.1. However, due to financial constraints, the lack of a comparison with extensive human evaluations remains a limitation for the comprehensive validation of our method.\nWe applied our method to DPO, a prominent supervised preference learning method. Since DPO is prone to overfitting due to its inherently ineffective regularization with KL divergence as analyzed by Azar et al. (2023), some of our experiments could be impacted. Despite this vulnerability of DPO, our proposed self-curation remains independent of specific preference learning methods thus can enhance various DPO variants. Future work should explore its synergy with other preference learning methods, as resource constraints limited our scope to DPO in this work."}, {"title": "Broader Impact Statement", "content": "The proposed self-curation method detects and excludes annotation inconsistencies in preference datasets, allowing models to learn better curated preferences even with less data. The proposed approach, however, focuses more on refining an existing dataset rather than mitigating biases that may be introduced during data creation as highlighted by Atari et al. (Working Paper). If the preference dataset to which our method is applied is biased, the proxy model trained on this dataset will be impacted. Consequently, the self-curation process using these learned patterns might exacerbate the bias in the resulting subset. While this poses a potential risk, it underscores the need for future research to address such biases to ensure fair and unbiased preference learning. A generalized proxy, as discussed in Sec. 5 and Appendix B.8, can be a promising approach to alleviate this potential risk in our method once it is trained on extensive well-balanced preference datasets. For that reason, addressing biases and ensuring balanced datasets during the data creation phase is complementary to our self-curation method and necessary for more ethical, unbiased and fair outcomes."}, {"title": "A Dataset", "content": "In this section, we explain datasets that are used in our experiments.\nA.1 UltraChat\nThe UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023) is an automatically generated dataset using GPT-3.5-Turbo that contributes to strengthening LLMs by capturing diverse conversation contexts. The dataset consists of 1.47M multi-turn dialogues over 30 topics including 1,100 subtopics and 20 types of \"writing\". The 774K dataset is completed by generating 3-7 turns dialog data based on questions or instructions generated from three sectors such as \"Questions about the World\", \"Writing and Creation\" and \"Assistance on Existent Materials\".

We used UltraChat (200K) during supervised fine-tuning stage for the purpose of comparison with our default preferred-FT setting.\nA.2 UltraFeedback\nThe UltraFeedback (Cui et al., 2023) is designed to use the expertise of good preference models such as GPT-4 to align LLMs with human values. The dataset consists of 61K instructions and chosen/rejected response pairs for each instruction. The instructions were sampled from source datasets such as UltraChat, ShareGPT, Evol-Instruct, TruthfulQA, FalseQA and FLAN. The responses for each instruction were generated using four models that are randomly sampled from the models such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, Llama 2-Chat, Falcon-40B-Instruct and so on. Using the scores rated by GPT-4 for the four responses, the highest scoring response is defined as the chosen response and a randomly selected response from the remaining response as the rejected response, where the score criteria is instruction-following, truthful, honesty and helpfulness.

Each pair includes safety meta-labels and annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness provided by multiple crowd workers. For our preference learning, we incorporated data annotated as the better response into our training set for chosen responses only if labeled as safe.

By default, we conduct preferred-FT for this stage. (2) Preference Learning that directly optimizes the model using the preference dataset x, Yc, Yr, where x is a prompt and Yc, Yr are the preferred and dispreferred responses.\nOur experiments apply the DPO framework to align the Llama 2 7B model.

We additionally compared the results to the chosen responses from the test set (ground truths). Furthermore, we conduct a direct comparison between the outputs of the two models for more thorough investigation.

A proxy is trained using Anthropic-Helpful and the other uses Anthropic-Harmless. Thus self-curation is applied separately to each of two datasets with the relevant proxy. Three hundreds of instances are randomly sampled from each respective test set and applied to all evaluations under the same preference datasets.\nB.6 Data Scale Impact\nWe analyze the impact of the dataset scale on self-curation. We start with a subset of 5K instances from Anthropic-Helpful and evaluate DPO with and without self-curation. Additional subsets of 5K instances are incrementally added. As shown in the moving average trend of Fig. 4, applying self-curation quickly reaches peak performance in the early stage, while the baseline (no curation) improves slowly and plateaus at a lower level. Self-curation enables a performance that the baseline cannot reach, using only about one-third of the dataset.

This implies that the data with positive reward difference are also ambiguous when the values are close to zero.\nBased on this finding, we explore higher self-curation thresholds using Anthropic-Helpful and UltraFeedback datasets by a grid search as shown in Fig. 5, Table 7 and Table 8.

For Anthropic Harmless, we utilized (Cail et al., 2023), that generated chosen responses using GPT-4 to enhance quality. We note that the target preference datasets such as UltraFeedback and Dolly are excluded from the mix of training sets to keep each out-of-distribution.\nResult In Ultrafeedback, more than 72% are curated with its dedicated proxy as described in Table 2 whereas 62% of instances are obtained using the generalized proxy. In Dolly-DPO, 81% are curated with its dedicated proxy and 85% with the generalized one. As demonstrated in Table 9 and Table 10, the win scores of the generalized proxy are comparable or even superior compared to each dedicated proxy. This result indicates that a generalized version of proxy model could be effectively applied to our method.\nB.9 Supervised Finetuning Comparison\nFor simplicity, we perform preferred-FT to pretrained Llama 27B to boost DPO in all experiments. In practical situations, however, we may encounter different training pipelines for pre-DPO models.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "As the backbone of mobile communication networks, base stations not only provide seamless connectivity for mobile users, ensuring the continuity and reliability of communication, but also support the ever-increasing demand for high data throughput [1], [2]. This capability allows users to enjoy high-speed network services even while on the move. With the proliferation of smartphones and mobile devices, the number of mobile users has surged and the demand for data speed and quality has increased accordingly [3]\u2013[5]. On-demand base station siting (BSS) has therefore become particularly critical and challenging, as it directly affects the breadth and depth of network coverage and the quality of service experienced by users [6]\u2013[8].\nConventional BSS techniques assess network performance and pinpoint areas for improvement predominantly through road testing and user feedback. Specifically, road testing involves the collection of signal quality data by deploying measurement equipment across predetermined geographic areas. Although this method can yield insightful insights, it is time-consuming and often impractical to implement, particularly in densely populated urban environments [9]. Moreover, road testing collects data at a specific time and location, which might not accurately represent the dynamic changes in the entire network performance over time [10]. User complaints and feedback constitute another essential method for identifying coverage issues and service quality deficiencies in traditional approaches [11]. However, activating this reactive strategy means that network improvements are typically not initiated until problems become severe enough to provoke user complaints. Additionally, the collected feedback may not be representative of the entire user population, potentially leading to biased or incomplete data [12], [13]. Engineers must engage in a continuous and iterative process that includes analyzing feedback, modeling BSS problems, developing solutions, deploying new base stations, and reevaluating network performance [14].\nGiven these limitations, traditional BSS approaches [15] demand engineers to possess extensive expertise in communications, networking, optimization, and programming, coupled with strong problem-formative, analytical, and problem-solving skills. The continuous advancements in telecommunications technology [16], [17] and the evolving patterns of user behavior [18] necessitate that engineers continually learn and adapt, further increasing the complexity of the task. Additionally, the dynamic character of urban environments, which is characterized by fluctuating traffic patterns [19], dynamic user mobility [20] and also time-varying user requirements [21], further complicates the BSS optimization.\nA promising solution to these challenges is the integration of AI into BSS processes, especially large language models (LLMs) such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT)-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-40. These LLMs can not only generate human-like text [22], [23], but also solve complex problems in a wide range of domains, including mathematics [24], programming [25], visual arts [26], medicine [27], and psychology [28]. Users can now describe requirements in natural language, enabling modeling and coding processes from semi-automatic to fully automatic, freeing up professionals to concentrate more on intricate problem solving and innovative design. For instance, LLMs are capable of writing numerical algorithms in mathematical and physical [29], generating computer code related to chemical equations and structures in chemistry [30], and assisting power engineers in problem decomposition and code generation in electronic engineering [31].\nRegarding BSS problem, LLMs offer the following benefits: i) LLMs can process enormous amounts of real-time data from various sources, providing a comprehensive analysis of network performance, which allows for more efficient and accurate identification of weak coverage regions and service deficiencies; ii) LLMs can mitigate the lag associated with passive feedback mechanisms by proactively suggesting improvements based on continuously learning from network data and user feedback; iii) The ability of LLMs to adjust dynamically to alterations in traffic patterns and user behavior can be utilized to guarantee that the generated BSS solutions remain relevant and effective in rapidly evolving urban environments.\nIn light of this, this research investigates how AI, in particular LLMs, may revolutionize BSS by improving the effectiveness of the siting procedure as well as the general caliber of mobile network services. Precisely, we explore an innovative LLM-empowered BSS method, which can be described as four main strategies according to the degree of human intervention and interaction between agents as follows: i) Prompt-optimized LLM-based (PoL-) strategy aims to using crafting-optimized interaction prompts to guide the LLMs to autonomously accomplish BSS tasks with minimal human intervention. This strategy is centered on employing well-designed prompts to guide the LLM effectively comprehending and managing intricate BSS requirements, generating accurate and reliable siting solutions. ii) Human-in-the-Loop LLM-based (HiLL-) strategy aims to simplify user involvement in BSS decision making by allowing even users with limited expertise to express their needs in plain natural language descriptions. HiLL strategy comprises intelligent prompts, policy recommendations, problem decomposition, task planning, and comprehensive evaluation to improve efficiency and intuitiveness of the user's interaction with the LLM. iii) LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent-based (LaBa-) strategy aims to develop an autonomous agent that is capable of managing the complete BSS process completely independently. To mitigate the hallucination problem, which is a typical issue in natural language processing (NLP), the system leverages external tools and databases to verify and validate the LLM's outputs. With the help of external validations, this agent is intended to assume complete control over BSS tasks, including data analysis and decision-making, and to increase the dependability of the generated siting strategies. iv) Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents-based (CLaBa-) strategy allows multiple agents work collaboratively to solve the BSS problem. This strategy first translates the problem into mathematical formulas and then automatically generates solver code based on those formulas. The generated code is executed to produce the solution and saved to a file for further analysis. The effectiveness of the solution is verified by a series of unit tests generated by the LLMs and altered by the user. If an execution error or test failure is encountered, the system automatically feeds back the error message, triggering the LLM to revise the code in an iterative process until the proper solution is found.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the use of LLM to solve the BSS problem. Our main contributions in this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We formulate a novel LLM-empowered BSS framework and heuristically propose four different potential implementations. Specifically, the proposed PoL strategy enables LLMs to autonomously perform BSS tasks with minimal human intervention; the HiLL strategy achieves a more intuitive and user-friendly BSS process by incorporating human insight and preferences into decision-making procedure; the LaBa strategy realizes the independent completion of the entire BSS process; CLaBa strategy is designed to ulteriorly mitigate hallucinations.\n\u2022 We conduct an empirical comparative analysis by using a dataset from the Mathorcup Undergraduate Mathematical Modeling Challenge 2022 [32]. This analysis not only assesses the performance of LLM-based tactics compared to traditional techniques in terms of traffic and cost-effectiveness, but also offers compelling data supporting the efficacy of LLM strategies in real-world applications.\n\u2022 Besides propelling technological advancements in BSS, we also introduce fresh perspectives and tools to the telecom network design domain. Through these innovative approaches, we are able to achieve more efficient, cost-effective and reliable network deployment to fulfill the expanding demand for communications, while optimizing resource allocation and reducing operational costs. In addition, our study provides several frameworks for future researchers to further explore and improve methods for applying LLMs to solve complex engineering problems.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II provides a description of the BSS problem. The prompt-optimized LLM and the LLM-based autonomous BSS agent are demonstrated in Sections III and IV, respectively. In Section V, a thorough comparison study is performed. The entire paper is concluded in Section VI."}, {"title": "II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION", "content": "This section offers a thorough formulation of the BSS problem and defines the key performance metrics used to evaluate network performance. We outline the optimization problem for determining the optimal locations for new base stations and introduce the metrics of traffic coverage and cost, which are critical for effective network planning and deployment."}, {"title": "A. Problem Formulation", "content": "The primary task of BSS is to identify areas with poor coverage areas in the current network and strategically deploy new base stations to enhance the coverage in these regions [33]. As shown in Fig. 1, the bottom layer shows the communication coverage of the existing network in a given urban area, where the red zones indicate the areas with poor communication coverage. Such areas can be identified by expensive and time-consuming road tests or can be located by user complaints about signal quality. In practical network planning, it is infeasible to solve all weak coverage problems simultaneously due to the high cost of base station construction. Therefore, it is necessary to prioritize weak coverage areas with high traffic volume.\nTo simplify calculations and facilitate understanding, we divide the given area into small grids, as shown in the middle layer of Fig. 1, and focus on the central point of each grid. When dividing the grid, we assume that the coverage radius of either macro base station or micro base station is an integer multiple of the grid radius, so as to ensure that the base station deployed in the center of the grid can provide communication coverage for the whole grid. Such a partition ensures that no matter the size of the region, the location candidate set of new base stations can be treated as a finite number of points. The BSS decision-making is based on specific attributes of each point, including coordinates, quality of communication coverage, and also volume of traffic. The main notations are listed in Table I.\nWhen deploying a new base station, the primary goal is to achieve seamless coverage service as much as possible in terms of the traffic flow, in addition, the distance between any two stations must be larger than a certain threshold in order to account for interference mitigation and deployment expenses. Telecom operators pursue lower costs while meeting signal coverage requirements via intelligent deployment of macro base stations and micro base stations, the former is characterized by a large coverage radius and higher construction cost, while the latter is more suitable for supplementary coverage and network capacity enhancement in particular places, such as hotspots with high traffic flow. Comprehensively considering the characteristics of base stations, network coverage and deployment costs, the BSS optimization problem could be formulated as follows:\n$\\(P1) \\underset{\\{p,q\\}}{\\operatorname{argmin}} \\{ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (p_i C_h + q_i C_d)\\},$\ns.t.(C1) $\\sum_{t \\in G_i} W_t (P_{i,h,t} + P_{i,d,t}) \\ge 0.9 \\sum_{t \\in G_i} w_t, \\forall i \\in N,$\n(C2) $p_i \\in \\{0,1\\}, q_i \\in \\{0,1\\}, \\forall i \\in N,$\n(C3) $p_i + q_i \\le 1, \\forall i \\in N,$\n(C4) $\\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (Y_i \u2013 y_j)^2} \\ge D_{min},$\nif $p_i + q_i = 1, \\forall i \\in N,\\forall j \\in T$\n(C5) $\\sqrt{(x_i - x_n)^2 + (Y_i - Y_n)^2} > D_{min},$\nif $p_i + q_i = 1$ and $p_n + q_n = 1, \\forall i, n \\in N$\nwith\n$P_{i,h,t} = P(p_i \\sqrt{(x_i - x_t)^2 + (Y_i - Y_t)^2} \\le d_h),$\n$P_{i,d,t} = P(q_i \\sqrt{(x_i - x_t)^2 + (Y_i - Y_t)^2} \\le d_d)$\nwhere $P_{i,h,t}$ and $P_{i,d,t}$ denote the probabilities that devices at location $t \\in G_i$ (with the coordinate $(x_t, Y_t)$) is covered by a macro base station or micro base station located at $(x_i, Y_i)$, respectively; $G_i$ denotes the entire area in grid $i$; $w_t$ denotes the traffic volume associated with location $(x_t, y_t)$; $N$ denotes the coordinate set of all candidate locations for new base stations, and $N$ represents the total number of grid points; $T$ is the coordinate set of all existing base stations; $d_h$ and $d_d$ represent the coverage radii of macro base station and micro base station, respectively; $C_h$ and $C_d$ are the costs of macro base station and micro base station, respectively; $D_{min}$ is the minimum distance between arbitrary two base stations; $p_i$ and $q_i$ denote the Boolean variables indicating whether a macro base station or a micro base station is deployed at the central point of grid $i$, respectively; $(x_i, Y_i)$ is the coordinates of grid $i$'s central point; $(x_j, y_j)$ is the coordinates of the $j$th existing base station.\nIn the optimization problem P1, C1 indicates that the communication coverage probability for data traffic should be greater than 90%; C2 shows the value of the deployment decision; C3 indicates that Only one new base station, either macro or micro base station, can be built in one single location; C4 and C5 indicate that the distance between any two base stations should be at least greater than $D_{min}$."}, {"title": "B. Performance Metrics", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of BSS solution, we adopt traffic coverage and deployment cost as performance metrics, which are essential for BSS design and optimization since they could comprehensively reflect network performance and resource utilization efficiency. Specifically, traffic coverage is a critical factor in BSS optimization as it has a direct impact on network performance and user satisfaction. It refers to the percentage of total traffic in a particular area that is covered and served by base stations. Ensuring a high level of traffic coverage is essential for maintaining service quality and preventing congestion. Telecom networks can function more effectively and handle high traffic volumes without encountering congestion by covering a sizable portion of traffic, which is set at 90% in this work. This paper aims to develop a LLM-empowered framework to provide an efficient method for optimizing base station layout under the premise of maintaining satisfactory traffic coverage. Deployment cost refers to the total expenditure required to deploy and maintain the base stations needed to achieve the desired traffic coverage."}, {"title": "C. Traditional Method for BSS", "content": "In urban areas, traditional BSS method relies on road testing of communication signals and user feedback regarding call quality. This process requires communications engineers to perform multiple steps to ensure that the deployment of new base stations effectively improves network coverage and user experience. The details are as follows.\nFirst, communications engineers conduct road tests to measure and record signal strength, coverage, and data transmission rates at different locations by driving test vehicles on urban roads. These test data provide engineers with a dispassionate assessment of current network performance and help identify areas of weak coverage and blind spots. The next step for engineers is to collect user feedback. Users typically report call quality issues, such as dropped calls, dropped calls, weak signals, or unstable data connections, by calling customer service or using mobile apps. The engineer then compiles all of these user feedback into a thorough problem report. This feedback reveals potential issues with the real user experience in addition to issues discovered during the road test. The engineers started modeling the base station location issue after gathering enough information and feedback. During this phase, several aspects must be taken into account, including topography, building barriers, subscriber density and the layout of existing base stations.\nDeveloping the solution is the next critical step. Based on the results of the model analysis, engineers determine the optimal location for the new base station. They can use optimization algorithms, such as simulated annealing [34], genetic algorithms [35], or particle swarm optimization (PSO) [36], to balance coverage effectiveness, construction costs, and operational efficiency to find the optimal solution. Once the solution is determined, engineers will implement the construction of the new base station. Once the new base station is operational, engineers need to collect feedback again. They monitor the performance of the new base station and evaluate its improvement in network coverage and call quality through road tests and user feedback. Based on feedback, engineers may need to make further tweaks and optimizations to ensure that the new base station is getting the most out of it.\nDespite being efficient, this conventional method has numerous drawbacks. Time and human resources are needed for the entire process, particularly during the data collection and processing stage. Furthermore, there is frequently a delay in the data gathering and processing of client feedback, which might lead to problems not being resolved in a timely manner."}, {"title": "III.

Next, we describe their workflow in detail."}, {"title": "A. Prompt-optimized LLM-based (PoL-) Strategy", "content": "The PoL strategy is presented in this subsection as a potential solution to the BSS issue in wireless networks. PoL strategy harnesses the sophisticated capabilities of LLMs to streamline the workflow for engineers by automating key steps, including prompt formulation, model validation, error identification, and iterative optimization. This automation not only expedites the BSS process but also reduce human intervention.\nAs depicted in Fig. 2, the PoL-based framework encompasses the entire workflow from preliminary site selection to final configuration determination. Through carefully crafted prompts, LLM can efficiently comprehend and handle the intricate requirements of BSS, consequently producing solutions. The purpose of optimizing these prompts is to guide LLM become more proficient in issue comprehension, modeling, and coding. Furthermore, Fig.3 illustrates the application of the framework in the processes of automatic modeling and coding. In response to researcher prompts, LLM is capable of providing the basic mathematical model for the BSS problem, including an objective function for minimizing the total cost of new base stations, as well as constraints such as coverage and base station distance. Additionally, the LLM utilizes the pulp optimizer as a solver and writes Python code to solve the BSS problem based on the aforementioned mathematical model.\nIn addition to showcasing the potential of artificial intelligence to automate the resolution of intricate combinatorial optimization problems, the LLM framework presented in this study also highlights the potent synergy between AI and human expert knowledge, providing a novel and reliable approach for the field of wireless network planning."}, {"title": "B. Human-in-the-loop LLM-based (HiLL-) Strategy", "content": "As illustrated in Fig. 2, the concept of the PoL framework is straightforward. However, our primary goal is to evaluate various LLMs\u2019 capabilities in addressing routine BSS tasks. In the site selection modeling phase, the precision of the LLM\u2019s suggested solution needs to be confirmed by engineering expertise. If there are discrepancies, feedback is provided through fresh prompts that specify the error type without explicitly stating the correction method. In the coding phase for base station configuration, the LLM-generated code is executed to identify any functional issues. Errors are communicated back to the LLM with the associated system error messages, prompting necessary adjustments. Upon successful execution, the proposed base station configurations are validated against benchmarks set by established network planning tools. Any deviations are fed back into the LLM to refine the solution further. Through this iterative collaboration between communication engineers and LLMs, it is feasible to automate the programming and optimization of BSS problems.\nA simple prompt, such as \u201cHow to optimize the layout of 5G base stations in an urban environment,\u201d may not provide sufficient details to allow an LLM to generate a comprehensive solution on its own. To address this challenge, we propose a HiLL framework that combines the computational advantages of LLMs with the expertise of telecommunications engineers. As shown in Fig. 4, the framework intended to serve as an algorithmic consultant for the project, using sophisticated models such as ChatGPT 4.0 to provide more targeted analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 4. For instance, ChatGPT can recommend literature on \u201cheuristic methods for optimizing network infrastructure layout\u201d and suggest the use of algorithms such as genetic and PSO algorithms [36] for dynamic BSS.\nFollowing the framework\u2019s guidance, ChatGPT can break down the BSS problem into the following actionable steps, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). First, define objectives and constraints. Second, collect data. Third, perform mathematical modeling. Fourth, develop optimization algorithms. Fifth, refine solutions. And sixth, plan and implement deployment. This step-by-step approach requires a combination of domain-specific knowledge and programming skills, where human input is invaluable throughout the process.\nFollowing an examination of the recommended literature and ChatGPT\u2019s deconstruction of the BSS issue, telecom engineers can further refine these tasks into more specific coding subtasks that LLMs can help with. Subtasks 1 through 5 include, for instance, reading and processing data, designing a fitness function to assess each site option, initializing the particle swarm and designating each particle as a site option, updating the particle position and velocity in accordance with the fitness function to find the best solution, and deciding on the site selection scheme based on the final group optimal location. ChatGPT\u2019s coding implementation for subtask 3 is displayed in Fig. 5 (b).\nIn summary, the HiLL strategy enables LLMs to recommend relevant literature and methods to initiate BSS projects. Once engineers grasp the technical roadmap, they need to decompose the problem into subtasks that LLMs can help with. The ability of LLMs to generate code snippets and provide programming guidance significantly reduces development time and complexity, allowing engineers to focus on synthesizing key components and optimizing the system.

These data sources are diverse, including road test data and user feedback data. Road test data is collected by communications engineers who drive test vehicles through urban roads, measuring and recording signal strength, coverage, and data transmission rates. The agent uses these data to objectively assess current network performance, identifying areas with weak coverage and blind spots. User feedback is collected through customer service calls or mobile apps, where users report issues with call quality, such as dropped calls, weak signals, or unstable data connections. The agent aggregates this user feedback into detailed problem reports, supplementing the findings from the road tests.\nAfter gathering sufficient data, the agent processes and deeply analyzes these data. Data processing steps include data cleaning and pre-processing to remove noise and invalid data, ensuring data quality. Subsequently, the agent extracts key features from the data, such as signal strength distribution and user density distribution, which serve as inputs for subsequent modeling. Using advanced modeling techniques and optimization algorithms, the agent generates BSS strategies. These algorithms, including simulated annealing, genetic and PSO algorithms, help the agent balance coverage effectiveness, construction costs, and operational efficiency to find the optimal solution.\nTo ensure the reliability of the generated siting strategies, the agent uses external tools and databases for validation. This step includes data accuracy checks and strategy effectiveness assessments. To be more precise, data accuracy checks verify the accuracy of the input data, ensuring a reliable data foundation. Strategy effectiveness assessments use simulation tools to evaluate the generated siting strategies in practical applications, considering metrics such as coverage, signal quality, and user experience.

This approach leverages both human expertise and the computational power of the LLM. The iterative process involves human experts providing feedback on the LLM-generated solutions, which the LLM then uses to refine its outputs continuously. This synergy allows the model to address complex problems that may be challenging for an LLM to solve autonomously. The results, illustrated in Fig. 9, indicate that the HiLL strategy achieved a traffic coverage of 90.01% with a total cost of 26. The HiLL\u2019s ability to achieve a higher traffic coverage with a lower cost can be attributed to the integration of human insights and preferences into the decision-making process.

Fig. 11 illustrates that the cooperative multiple LLM-based agents achieved a total traffic coverage of 90.44% with a cost metric of 31. This method effectively balances coverage needs with cost constraints, demonstrating the ability of multiple LLMs working together to provide a robust and cost-effective solution for base station planning.\nUnlike the LaBa strategy, the CLaBa strategy emphasizes collaboration among multiple LLMs. Each LLM specializes in different aspects of the BSS task, such as problem representation, mathematical formulation, code generation, and solution verification. This cooperative approach enhances problem-solving efficiency and adaptability by allowing each LLM to focus on its strengths, significantly reducing the need for extensive human intervention. Furthermore, this collaborative effort facilitates continuous improvement and iterative refinement of solutions through feedback mechanisms, ensuring that the final outcomes are reliable and effective. The choice of traffic coverage and cost as performance metrics is justified because they directly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of base station placement. High traffic coverage ensures that the majority of weak coverage points are served, while low cost ensures that the solution is economically viable.\n5) Performance Comparison and Analysis: In addition, we tested the success rate of four proposed LLM-based methods for solving the BSS problem, each of which was tested 10 times. From Fig. 12, it is evident that the CLaBa strategy has the highest success rate among the four approaches.

Specifically, LLMs can analyze historical data and current network status, predict future network needs, optimize resource allocation in advance, and reduce network congestion and latency. The integration of LLMs does, however, come with certain difficulties, including designing flexible interfaces to adapt to different network environments, developing efficient algorithms to meet real-time requirements, and optimizing models to accommodate the resource constraints of network devices. By adopting a modular design, different components of the LLMs can be integrated into the network system as needed. Algorithm optimization can reduce computing resource consumption to ensure fast responses. Additionally, flexible interface design ensures that LLMs can operate efficiently in various network environments."}, {"title": "B. Task-oriented Selection in Human-LLM Interaction or Pure LLMS", "content": "For the future generation of networking and communication systems, it is essential to make the task-oriented decision between a human-LLM interaction framework or a fully automated LLM framework. On the one hand, the purely autonomous LLM-based framework can significantly improves efficiency by reducing human involvement. However, LLMs are known to suffer from the hallucination problem, where models can produce inaccurate or misleading information. This issue is particularly severe in automated network management and communication systems, where it can result in hazards and faults in the system. On the other hand, human-LLM interaction can mitigate the impact of hallucinations, improving system reliability. Human involvement can serve as a verification and correction mechanism to detect and correct erroneous information generated by LLMs promptly. For example, in an automated customer service system, customer service personnel can review and adjust the model\u2019s responses to ensure users receive accurate and reliable service. Although this approach may reduce overall efficiency, it enhances the accuracy and"}]}

However, alongside their impressive\ncapabilities, concerns have arisen regarding the inherent biases present in these models. Initial research\nhas revealed that these biases manifest in various ways, particularly in the representation of gender, often\nperpetuating stereotypes and power imbalances.\n\nThe author's previous research [1] examined the interpretation of iconic artworks like the Winged Victory\nof Samothrace and Judy Chicago's The Dinner Party through the lens of these Al models. It demonstrated\na consistent tendency to default to masculine figures when depicting power and victory, even when\nexplicitly prompted with feminine pronouns. Additionally, these models frequently struggle to capture the\nnuanced complexities of female identity, often resorting to stereotypical representations of femininity. This\nbias towards conventional portrayals of women raises questions about the diversity and inclusivity of the\ntraining data used to develop these models.\n\nThe present research is situated is driven by a curiosity to understand the extent to which these Al models\nreflect existing societal biases or even amplify them. To explore this, the study focuses on the construction\nindustry, a field traditionally dominated by men. By generating images of both male and female\nconstruction workers using identical prompts, with the only difference being the gender pronouns, this\nproject seeks to uncover the visual and ideological discrepancies in how Al represents gender within this\nspecific context.\n\nSituated within the broader context of Al art, gender studies, and visual culture, this research draws on\nongoing discussions about potential biases and the representation of diverse cultures and perspectives in\nthe training data of text-to-image models. Grounded in Griselda Pollock's seminal work on visual culture\nand sexual difference [2], this project examines how Al, as a contemporary system of representation, can\neither perpetuate or challenge existing societal biases. The focus on construction workers serves as a\npotent lens through which to analyze the complex interplay between gender, power, and visual\nrepresentation in the digital age.\n\nThis research aims not only to shed light on the inherent biases of Al models but also to contribute to\nbroader discussions on the ethical implications of Al in creative practices and its potential impact on\nshaping cultural perceptions of gender. Through this exploration, the study seeks to reveal the extent to\nwhich Al systems reinforce or disrupt traditional gender norms and to inform future developments in Al\ntechnology and its applications in art and society."}, {"title": "Background and Related Work", "content": "The representation of gender within visual culture has been a fertile ground for critical inquiry, particularly\nwithin feminist scholarship. Griselda Pollock's seminal work, Vision and Difference (1988) [2], established\na foundational framework for understanding how visual representations of women in art are not merely\naesthetic choices, but are deeply intertwined with societal power dynamics and gender ideologies.\nPollock's analysis demonstrates how these representations often function as \"signs\" that reinforce\ntraditional gender roles and limit female agency, inspiring generations of scholars to scrutinize the ways\nvisual culture shapes our understanding of gender and other social identities. This theoretical framework\nprovides a critical lens through which to examine potential biases in Al-generated art and its impact on\ncontemporary representations of gender.\n\nFollowing Pollock's groundbreaking work, feminist scholarship in visual culture has continued to evolve and\nexpand. Amelia Jones' anthology The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader (2003) [3], compiles key texts\naddressing art, film, architecture, popular culture, and new media from a feminist perspective exploring\nintersections of feminism with various visual fields. Victoria Horne and Lara Perry's Feminism and Art\nHistory Now (2017) [4] challenges established norms within feminist art history, advocating for more\ninclusive and intersectional approaches that acknowledge the diversity of female experiences and\nperspectives. Both works build upon Pollock's foundation, showcasing the diversity and dynamism of\nfeminist thought in visual studies and underscoring the importance of critically engaging with how gender\nis represented, interpreted, and contested.\n\nIn media studies, Laura Mulvey's influential essay [5] introduced the concept of the \"male gaze,\" which has\nbeen instrumental in analyzing how film and television often objectify and sexualize women. This analysis\nhas since been expanded to consider the intersection of race and gender [6] and to challenge the very\nnotion of fixed gender identities [7]. Similarly, Erving Goffman's analysis in Gender Advertisements [8] laid\nthe groundwork for understanding how advertising perpetuates gender stereotypes. Scholars have\ncontinued to examine the representation of gender in advertising and its impact on societal perceptions,\nas well as how representations of masculinity and femininity in advertisements have changed over time.\n[9].\n\nThe rise of digital and social media has added another layer to this analysis, with studies examining the\nimpact of these platforms on body image [10], self-representation [11] and the potential for both\nreinforcing and challenging traditional gender norms [12]. These diverse perspectives highlight the ongoing\nrelevance and importance of critically examining gender representation in contemporary media. The\nevolving landscape of media, from traditional film and television to the ever-expanding realm of digital and\nsocial media, presents new challenges and opportunities for understanding how gender is constructed,\nperformed, and contested in the 21st century.\n\nThe growing reliance on visual imagery in contemporary culture, as emphasized by Jakubowicz [13] further\nunderscores the importance of Pollock's work. This heightened reliance on visual communication amplifies\nthe potential impact of gender biases embedded within these representations.\n\nThe emergence of Al-generated art has introduced a new layer of complexity to this discourse, raising\nsignificant concerns about the potential for these technologies to perpetuate or even amplify existing\nbiases. Research has exposed the biases embedded in Al systems [14], [15], including those related to\ngender [16]. For example, studies have shown that Al systems, particularly those based on machine\nlearning, can inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, influencing a wide range of\napplications and raising concerns about the perpetuation of existing biases.\n\nIn the realm of visual culture, Al-generated images are not immune to these biases. Text-to-image models,\ntrained on vast datasets of images and text often skewed towards dominant cultural perspectives, can\nproduce images that reflect and perpetuate societal stereotypes. Studies have highlighted the racial and\ngender biases in facial recognition systems [17], which exhibited significantly higher error rates for women\nand people of color compared to white men. Similarly, research found that text-to-image models tend to\ngenerate images of people that conform to stereotypes based on gender, race, and other social identities\n[18]. This bias can have significant consequences for cultural production, as Al-generated images become\nincreasingly prevalent in art, advertising, and other forms of media.\n\nAs Al-generated content becomes more prevalent, it is crucial to understand and mitigate these biases to\nensure fair and equitable representation. The potential impact of Al bias on cultural production is\nprofound. Al-generated content, from artwork to advertisements, can shape societal attitudes and\nreinforce existing stereotypes. Therefore, examining how these technologies might inadvertently\nperpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities is essential."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "This project is grounded in feminist theories of visual culture, particularly the work of Griselda Pollock, and\ncontemporary research on bias in Al, specifically how it intersects with gender representation. Drawing\nupon Pollock's framework, this research explores how Al systems, trained on potentially biased data, can\neither perpetuate or challenge societal norms and stereotypes. To expose these biases and limitations, this\nproject intentionally \"misuses\" text-to-image models through targeted prompt engineering, aiming to\nreveal how these systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing societal biases. This methodology serves\nas a form of critical engagement, challenging the perceived objectivity of Al-generated content and\nprompting a reevaluation of these technologies' role in shaping societal attitudes towards gender and in\ncultural production.\n\nThe construction industry, traditionally male-dominated, provides a potent lens for this examination. Its\ninherent power dynamics, physicality, and visual tropes offer a rich context to analyze how Al models\ninterpret and represent gender. By focusing on this domain, the project seeks to reveal underlying\nassumptions about gender roles and expectations embedded within Al algorithms, particularly within a\ncontext often perceived as masculine.\n\nThis project utilized two leading text-to-image models, DALL-E [19] and Midjourney [20], chosen for their\nwidespread use and state-of-the-art capabilities in generating high-quality, detailed images from textual\ndescriptions. Prompt engineering is crucial for controlling the output of these models, and in this case, it\nwas deliberately manipulated to highlight potential biases. Both models were fed identical prompts, with\nthe only variation being the use of gender-specific pronouns (he/she) to create pairs of images depicting\nmale and female construction workers. This method isolates gender as the variable, ensuring that any\ndifferences in the generated images are directly attributable to gender, thus exposing the models'\nembedded biases.\n\nA series of meticulously crafted prompts were designed to depict diverse scenes and scenarios within the\nconstruction industry, focusing on elements that would probe gender representation and differences:\n\n\u2022 Dawn's Symphony of Industry: A scene of a site manager surveying the construction site at dawn,\nemphasizing leadership and presence. The juxtaposition of traditionally masculine imagery (\"steel\nand concrete\") with feminine-coded language (\"symphony,\" \"ballet\") challenges the Al to reconcile\nthese contrasting elements in its depiction of the female site manager.\n\n\u2022 A Tapestry of Skill and Grit: A site manager guiding workers, showcasing authority and skill. The use\nof words like \"tapestry\" and \"weaves\" traditionally associated with feminine crafts, contrasts with\nthe ruggedness of construction, prompting the Al to consider how it portrays female expertise in a\nmale-dominated field.\n\n\u2022 A Conductor of Controlled Chaos: A site manager orchestrating the construction site, highlighting\nleadership and control. The metaphor of a \"conductor\" leading a \"symphony\" challenges the Al to\nvisualize female authority in a dynamic and complex environment.\n\n\u2022 A Symphony of Sweat and Sacrifice: The prompt emphasizes resilience and accomplishment,\njuxtaposing the \"muddy chaos\" with the \"quiet triumph\" of the emerging structure. The phrase\n\"symphony of sweat and sacrifice\" challenges the Al to depict the female site manager's leadership\nand the emotional weight of her achievements amidst challenging conditions..\n\n\u2022 Muddied Grit: A site manager navigating a challenging, muddy site, emphasizing resilience and\ndetermination. The harsh conditions and the manager's unwavering focus are designed to elicit how\nthe Al represents female perseverance.\n\n\u2022 Carpenter: A Ballet of Balance: A carpenter balancing on a beam high above the city, emphasizing\nprecision and skill. The juxtaposition of \"ballet\" with the physical demands of carpentry challenges\nthe Al's depiction of female physicality and expertise.\n\n\u2022 Mason: The Art of Endurance: A mason laboring under the sun, highlighting strength and\nperseverance. The prompt emphasizes traditionally masculine qualities to examine how the Al\nportrays female resilience and dedication.\n\n\u2022 Ironworker Defying Gravity: An ironworker maneuvering on steel beams, showcasing agility and\ncourage. The use of \"defying gravity\" and \"dancing\" challenges the Al to depict female bravery and\nphysical prowess in a hazardous environment.\n\nEach model generated multiple images for each prompt, resulting in a diverse dataset for analysis. The final\nimages were selected based on their ability to highlight visual discrepancies and similarities between male\nand female representations, as well as their potential narrative implications. The analysis focused on body\nlanguage, clothing, facial expressions, tools and equipment, and interaction with the environment to\nuncover subtle ways in which Al models may perpetuate or challenge gender stereotypes. The goal is not\nto judge the aesthetic quality of the images but to critically examine the narratives they construct and their\npotential impact on our understanding of gender in the digital age."}, {"title": "Analysis and Findings", "content": "The comparative analysis of Al-generated images of male and female construction workers unveils a\nconsistent pattern of gendered representation that reinforces and, at times, amplifies existing societal\nbiases. This analysis highlights four predominant themes: the sexualization and aesthetic focus on female\nfigures, discrepancies in depicted authority and leadership, contrasting narratives of resilience and\ntriumph, and varying degrees of professionalism, safety, and expertise between genders.\n\nIn several image pairs, the Al models demonstrate a tendency to sexualize female figures by emphasizing\ntheir physical form and attractiveness over their professional roles. This is particularly evident in \"Muddied\nGrit\" (Figure 1), where the female site manager's pose is reminiscent of action heroines like Lara Croft,\nfocusing more on her figure and muddied boots than on the task at hand. In contrast, the male manager,\nthough equally muddied, adopts a more realistic supervisory pose that focuses on the worksite. This\ndiscrepancy suggests a prioritization of the female's physicality and aesthetic appeal over her professional\nrole. Similarly, in \"Carpenter: A Ballet of Balance\" (Figure 2), the female carpenter's dynamic pose, flowing\nhair, and attire emphasize her form rather than her expertise, while the male carpenter is depicted in a\npractical, focused manner. This focus on aesthetic appeal versus practicality is echoed in \"Mason: The Art\nof Endurance\" (Figure 3), where the female mason's pose is stylized and dance-like, whereas the male\nmason's posture reflects the physical exertion required by his task.\n\nThe Al models often depict a discrepancy in the portrayal of authority and leadership between genders. In\n\"Dawn's Symphony of Industry\" (Figure 4), the female site manager's casual attire and relaxed posture\ncontrast with the male's professional workwear and engaged stance, suggesting a bias associating men\nwith greater authority. This disparity is further amplified in \"A Tapestry of Skill and Grit\" (Figure 5), which\nportrays the female site manager in an exaggerated, action-hero pose lacking the calm authority exuded\nby the male manager's realistic pose and formal attire. Furthermore, in \"A Conductor of Controlled Chaos\"\n(Figure 6), the female site manager's passive and disconnected demeanor sharply contrasts with the male\nfigure's active engagement and focused expression, reinforcing stereotypes of female passivity and male\nproactivity in leadership roles.\n\nLastly, the practicality and realism in job-specific attire and engagement further illustrate embedded\ngender stereotypes. Male figures are consistently shown as competent and well-prepared, as seen in the\nportrayal of the male ironworker equipped with all necessary safety gear, underscoring his professionalism\nand respect for the hazardous nature of the job. In stark contrast, in \"Ironworker Defying Gravity\" (Figure\n8), the female ironworker's cautious pose and lack of essential safety gear contrast with the male\nironworker, who is confidently equipped with all necessary protection. Additionally, the male figure's focus\non his tools and confident posture further emphasize his expertise and preparedness, reinforcing the\nstereotype of male expertise in high-risk professions.\n\nThese observations reveal that despite identical prompts, the Al models often produce images that align\nwith and amplify traditional gender stereotypes. A consistent pattern emerges across all scenarios: female\nfigures are often depicted in a manner that emphasizes aesthetics and physical agility, which could detract\nfrom their professional capabilities and authority. Such depictions frequently verge on the cinematic and\naction-heroic, potentially skewing realistic portrayals of women in construction-related fields. On the other\nhand, male figures are consistently portrayed as competent, well-prepared, and actively engaged,\nreinforcing traditional notions of male authority and expertise in professional settings. This disparity\nhighlights a significant bias in the Al-generated images, where female figures are often shown in roles that\nprioritize visual appeal and drama over substantive professional engagement, while male figures are\ndepicted in ways that underscore their capability and readiness for professional challenges."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The findings from this analysis, placed against the theoretical backdrop of Griselda Pollock's work on visual\nculture and gender, alongside broader discussions of gender bias in Al, illuminate how deeply ingrained\nbiases manifest in Al-generated content. Pollock's critical examination of how women are represented in\nthe visual arts-as shaped by broader societal narratives and power structures-parallels the observed\ndiscrepancies in the portrayals of male and female construction workers. The Al's inclination to accentuate\nthe physicality and aesthetics of female figures while underscoring the professionalism and authority of\nmale figures highlights a pervasive gender coding that reflects traditional gender roles and stereotypes.\n\nThese findings add a vital dimension to the ongoing discourse on gender bias in Al, illustrating how Al\nsystems can unintentionally perpetuate societal biases. Research, such as the study by Bolukbasi et al. [16],\nhas shown similar tendencies in text-based Al, where biases in training data result in biased outputs. The\nvisual discrepancies noted in this project suggest that without diligent oversight, Al technologies in art and\ndesign risk reinforcing outdated stereotypes instead of challenging them.\n\nThe analysis of Al-generated images offers profound insights into Al's role in perpetuating or confronting\nsocietal biases, especially regarding gender representation. This series acts as a powerful visual critique,\nprompting viewers to examine how male and female bodies are depicted, noting differences in attire,\nposture, and situational context. By juxtaposing images of male and female construction workers, this\nproject encourages critical reflections on whether these Al-generated images simply mirror the biases\npresent in their training data or reveal deeper, enduring sexist attitudes in society.\n\nPollock's theories, which assert that visual representations in art are not mere reflections but active\ncomponents in the cultural processes that either reinforce or challenge existing power structures and\ngender dynamics, hold significant relevance in this context. The utilization of Al, trained on extensive\ndatasets imbued with societal biases, raises the question of whether these technological systems simply\nreplicate the biases they are fed or actively contribute to a nuanced portrayal of gender.\n\nAl's dual role in this creative process\u2014as both a generator of content that unveils societal biases and a\nreflector of the biases inherent in visual culture-is crucial. This dual function highlights the need to\nscrutinize the sources of Al's training materials, which, despite their breadth, inherently carry the biases of\nthe societies that created them. This often results in the stereotypical portrayal of female figures in roles\nthat emphasize aesthetics and physical agility over professional capabilities and authority, raising critical\nquestions about the power dynamics embedded within these Al models.\n\nThis project also explores Al's potential to both sustain and challenge existing biases within visual culture.\nBy analyzing how Al-generated images position women relative to power structures and societal roles, the\nwork delves into the ideological meanings these images may convey. Are they merely perpetuating\ntraditional gender roles, or do they reflect shifts in broader social dynamics?\n\nReflecting on these findings, it becomes imperative to maintain vigilance and engage critically with Al\ntechnologies as they become more integrated into various aspects of our lives, from art to broader societal\ninteractions. This project not only critiques the technological and cultural representations of gender but\nalso calls for more transparent and accountable algorithmic processes.\n\nUltimately, by echoing Pollock's examination of the role of visual culture in perpetuating gender\ndifferences, this series enhances our understanding of how modern technology might either challenge or"}, {"title": "Conclusions and Future Directions", "content": "This project has surfaced critical insights into the representation of gender within Al-generated visual\ncontent, emphasizing how deep-seated societal biases are reflected and potentially perpetuated by Al\nsystems. The key takeaways demonstrate that Al, while a powerful tool in artistic creation, often replicates\nexisting gender stereotypes, depicting female figures in ways that emphasize aesthetics and physical agility\nand male figures as embodiments of competence and authority. These findings underscore the significant\nrole of Al in shaping cultural representations and highlight the urgent need for critical oversight to ensure\nthese technologies foster equitable portrayals.\n\nThe analysis strongly contributes to the field by illuminating the ways in which Al-generated images can\nserve both as mirrors of current societal biases and as potential tools for challenging these biases. It reveals\nthe necessity for artists and developers to engage critically with the source data and algorithmic processes\nused in Al systems to mitigate the risk of reinforcing harmful stereotypes.\n\nFuture research could extend this analysis to other professions and social contexts, exploring how Al\nmodels represent different identities and experiences. Additionally, research could focus on developing\nand testing methods for mitigating bias in Al models, such as diversifying training data and incorporating\nfairness constraints into algorithms.\n\nArtists and critics can play a crucial role in shaping the future of Al by using their work to raise awareness\nabout the potential biases and limitations of these technologies. By critically engaging with Al-generated\ncontent and advocating for greater transparency and accountability, artists and critics can help ensure that\nAl is developed and used in ways that promote equity, diversity, and social justice."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in natural language processing (NLP), offering unparalleled performance across a broad spectrum of tasks. Among these, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) [1] and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) [2] stand out as two of the most influential architectures. BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism enables it to deeply understand contextual relationships within text, making it particularly effective for comprehension-based tasks. On the other hand, GPT's unidirectional design and autoregressive modeling excel in generating coherent and contextually appropriate text. Together, these models exemplify the state of the art in leveraging transformer-based architectures to tackle diverse linguistic challenges.\nThe applications of LLMs can be broadly categorized into token-level and sentence-level tasks [3]. Token-level tasks, such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, require the model to process and predict attributes for individual tokens within a sequence. Sentence-level tasks, including sentiment analysis, entail aggregating token-level information to derive an overall understanding of the text's meaning. These tasks depend heavily on effective mechanisms to condense token embeddings into coherent sentence-level representations.\nIn this study, we focus on sentence-level tasks, particularly sentiment analysis, as it serves as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating the semantic capabilities of LLMs.\nPooling layers play a critical role in sentence-level tasks by aggregating token embeddings into unified representations [4]. Commonly employed pooling strategies include Mean pooling, which averages embeddings to provide a balanced view, Max pooling, which captures the most salient features, and Weighted Sum pooling, which applies learned weights to emphasize contextually significant tokens. Despite their importance, the comparative effects of these pooling mechanisms on different LLM architectures remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper evaluates the performance of these pooling strategies on BERT and GPT within the context of sentiment analysis. Our contributions are threefold:\n\u2022 We provide a comprehensive evaluation of Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum pooling mechanisms on BERT and GPT models.\n\u2022 We identify task-specific strengths and limitations of each pooling method, offering insights into their optimal use cases.\n\u2022 We present actionable recommendations for practitioners to select appropriate pooling mechanisms based on the specific requirements of downstream tasks."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "The transformer architecture, proposed by Vaswani et al. [5], addressed the sequential computation limitations of RNNS through self-attention mechanisms. This innovation enabled parallel processing of input sequences and more effective modeling of long-range dependencies, establishing the foundation for modern LLMs. The transformer's encoder-decoder architecture demonstrated superior performance in machine translation tasks and quickly became the de facto standard for neural sequence transduction models [6].\nBERT, introduced by Devlin et al. [1], marked a breakthrough in NLP by utilizing a bidirectional transformer architecture to generate contextual embeddings for tokens. Unlike unidirectional models, BERT captures relationships between words in both forward and backward directions, enabling superior understanding of text semantics. Numerous variations of BERT have since been developed to enhance its performance and efficiency. For example, RoBERTa [7] optimized BERT's training process by removing the next sentence prediction task and training on a larger dataset. DistilBERT [8] focuses on reducing model size while retaining most of BERT's performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments. BERT and its variants have been widely adopted for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and question answering.\nGPT, initially proposed by OpenAI [2], pioneered autoregressive modeling for text generation. The model predicts the next word in a sequence based on prior context, making it particularly effective for generative tasks such as text completion and summarization. Its successor, GPT-2 [9], significantly expanded the model's capacity and demonstrated remarkable versatility across tasks without task-specific finetuning. The introduction of GPT-3 [10] and GPT-4 [11] further advanced the state of the art, leveraging billions of parameters to perform complex tasks such as language translation and dialogue generation with minimal instruction. GPT models have found extensive applications in content creation, conversational agents, and zero-shot learning scenarios [12].\nPooling mechanisms are critical for aggregating token embeddings into sentence-level representations. Mean pooling, one of the simplest techniques, computes the average of token embeddings, providing a balanced view of the input. Max pooling, in contrast, captures the most salient features by selecting the maximum value along each dimension. Weighted Sum pooling introduces a learnable weighting mechanism to prioritize contextually important tokens [13], [14]. These pooling strategies have been explored in various contexts [13]. For instance, Justyna et al. [15] incorporated Mean pooling in their work on contextualized embeddings for sentence classification. Max pooling was applied by Conneau et al. [16] in supervised learning tasks to enhance feature selection. Despite these efforts, the comparative impact of pooling operations on LLMs such as BERT and GPT remains underexplored, especially for sentence-level tasks like sentiment analysis."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The attention mechanism serves as the architectural cornerstone of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) [4]. At its core, attention allows models to dynamically weight the importance of different tokens when processing sequential data. The standard attention mechanism can be mathematically formulated as:\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V\nwhere:\n\u2022 Q represents query matrices\n\u2022 K represents key matrices\n\u2022 V represents value matrices\n\u2022 dk is the dimension of the keys\nThis mechanism enables models to capture complex contextual relationships by allowing each token to attend to all other tokens in a sequence, generating rich, context-aware representations.\nThe attention mechanism generates token-level embeddings that must be aggregated to form sentence-level representations. Pooling layers play a crucial role in this aggregation process, condensing token embeddings into unified sentence embeddings. We explore three primary pooling strategies: Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum pooling.\nGiven the token-level embeddings X = {X1,X2,...,x\u03b9} produced by the attention mechanism, where x \u2208 Re and l represents sequence length, we explore three primary pooling strategies:\n1) Mean Pooling:\nPoolmean(X) = \\frac{1}{l} \\sum_{i=1}^{l}Xi\nMean pooling provides a balanced representation by averaging token embeddings, offering a uniform perspective across all tokens.\n2) Max Pooling:\nPoolmax(X) = max_{i=1}^{l} xi\nMax pooling captures the most salient features by selecting the maximum values across token dimensions e, emphasizing distinctive embedding characteristics.\n3) Weighted Sum Pooling:\nPoolws(X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{l} wiXi\nwhere W = {W1,W2,...,\u03c9\u03b9} represents learnable weight parameters. This approach dynamically assigns importance to different tokens through learned weights."}, {"title": "IV.

CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper provides a systematic evaluation of pooling mechanisms - Mean, Max, and Weighted Sum on two leading LLM families, BERT and GPT, with a focus on sentiment analysis as a representative sentence-level task. Our findings highlight the distinctive contributions of each pooling strategy: Mean pooling excels in general scenarios by providing stable and robust embeddings, Max pooling emphasizes salient features but may overfit to extremes, and Weighted Sum pooling offers flexibility but requires careful optimization. These results emphasize the importance of tailoring pooling mechanisms to align with task-specific requirements and model architectures.\nBy delving into the interplay between pooling strategies and LLM performance, this research fosters a deeper understanding of the design choices in pooling layers and their impact on downstream applications. Practical recommendations drawn from our analysis aim to guide researchers and practitioners in selecting appropriate pooling methods for their needs. Looking ahead, extending this investigation to additional architectures, tasks, and pooling variations holds promise for further refining the use of LLMs in NLP."}]}

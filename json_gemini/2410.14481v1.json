Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Real-time and high-reliability wireless communication network technologies have gained widespread application in emergency communications [1], unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks [2], and environmental monitoring [3] in the low-altitude economy, as illustrated in Fig. 1. These applications aim to improve channel resource allocation efficiency and improve user service quality. As the scale of wireless communication network deployments expands and related applications continue to evolve, wireless communication environments are becoming increasingly complex. Achieving objectives [4], [5] such as signal coverage optimization, flight trajectory estimation, and interference minimization among UAVs across various application scenarios presents significant challenges. These challenges stem from the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the operating environments and the need for efficient channel resource allocation. Furthermore, these objectives are inherently interdependent and must be jointly optimized under resource-constrained conditions to ensure the stable operation of the overall system. For example, the channel quality between UAVs and base stations (BSs), or among UAVs following different flight paths, can vary significantly. Therefore, UAV trajectory planning must account for channel conditions to ensure that the UAVs remain within areas of strong signal strength.\nSimilarly, signal coverage requirements vary depending on environmental factors in communication scenarios involving 6G and next-generation Wi-Fi networks. Obstacles, geographical features, and user locations can impact wireless signal strength. As a result, channel resource allocation algorithms must adapt to these dynamic factors to maintain stable, high-quality communication services. In such cases, it is crucial to develop channel allocation algorithms tailored to specific objectives across different scenarios. These algorithms should enable the system to dynamically allocate resources based on the relative positions and mission priorities of the communication tasks. Thus, optimization objectivessuch as signal coverage, trajectory planning, and interference managementare closely intertwined with channel resource allocation. Addressing these challenges requires real-time environmental sensing and adaptive resource allocation to meet the diverse demands of users across varying scenarios.\nThese resource allocation challenges in real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks are mathematically formulated as mixed-integer non-convex problems. Traditional optimization techniques typically employ approximate convex optimization or iterative optimization. For instance, in addressing the channel resource allocation problem in UAV networks, a hybrid approach combining matching exchange theory and continuous convex optimization has been proposed to solve [6]. Similarly, an efficient iterative algorithm has been developed to optimize both communication resource allocation and UAV trajectory in dual-mobile environments"}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "This paper considers a WNI-guided DRL optimization trajectory generation wireless communication system for resource allocation optimization. The demand side only needs to provide the entity attribute intent features of the wireless communication system, referred to as WNI in this paper, to the cloud generation model. This model can then generate resource allocation optimization trajectories that conform to the structure of the intentional wireless system. Importantly, this process does not require online deployment or model learning for wireless resource allocation optimization. This method will provide a design paradigm for solving the limitations of online AI resource allocation optimization in the low-altitude economy and other complex wireless network scenarios through offline creation and generation. Specifically, we refer to the wireless network generation paradigm of [18] for a more detailed design (as shown in Fig. 2), which mainly includes a pre-trainer and generator. The pre-trainer mainly guides the training process of WNI-guided trajectory GDM through an expert data model and BKB, while the generator generates a large amount of trajectory data through GDM and target WNI, and provides optimization policies to the target network. The core modules of this system are as follows:\nWNI Encoder: The knowledge graph is used to extract entity attribute intention features from the wireless network structure. This intention feature covers the entity attribute structure intention in a cell, which will be discussed in Section III. The encoded WNI \\(\\Delta\\) of the cell C can be expressed as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta = E_{WNI} (C, \\omega)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\(E_{WNI}(\\cdot)\\) is the knowledge graph encoding network, \\(\\omega\\) is the network parameter.\nChannel Model: The factors influencing wireless network performance span multiple layers, encompassing user requirements, channel conditions, infrastructure design, and protocol stack parameters. Additionally, dynamic factors such as noise, interference, and user mobility continuously impact the quality of communication services. However, these variations can be abstractly represented by the channel matrix \\(H(\\Delta)\\), which reflects the channel state in different WNI \\(\\Delta\\). Consequently, the network model can be represented as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Upsilon_{\\Delta_{i}} = H(\\Delta_{i}) \\cdot x_{\\Delta_{i}} + n\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) denotes i-th WNI, and \\(H(\\Delta_{i})\\) denotes the channel coefficient characterizes under WNI \\(\\Delta_{i}\\). The channel gain of the signal, represented as \\(g_{\\Delta_{i}} = E[|H(\\Delta_{i})|^{2}]\\). Without loss of generality, we define multiple independent distributions of the channel gain \\(g_{\\Delta}\\), to generalize the performance impact of the channel coefficient \\(H(\\Delta_{i})\\) under various WNIs \\(\\Delta\\).\nExpert Data Model: For the original cell C \\(\\{C_{1}, C_{2},..., C_{M}\\}\\) scenario with M WNI feature sets \\(\\Delta\\) \\(\\{\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2},......, \\Delta_{M}\\}\\), the downlink expert trajectory tuple for each user in the scenario C is used as the training dataset for the generative model. For each WNI \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) scenario, a total of K trajectory data are collected, one of which is denoted as \\(\\tau_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j} = \\langle s_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}, a_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}, r_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}, s_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j'}\\rangle\\). In the above context of the channel model, the trajectory elements \\(s_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}\\), \\(a_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}\\), \\(r_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j}\\), and \\(s_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j'}\\) correspond to the channel gain \\(g_{\\Delta}^{j}\\), the allocated power \\(p_{t}\\), the target system optimization performance \\(G_{j}(A_{i})\\), and the next time channel gain \\(s_{\\Delta_{i}}^{j'}\\), respectively. Then the expert dataset corresponding to the intention \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) can be expressed as \\(D_{\\Delta_{i}} = \\{\\tau_{\\Delta_{i}}^{1}, \\tau_{\\Delta_{i}}^{2},...,\\tau_{\\Delta_{i}}^{K}\\}\\), and the expert dataset of the entire intention \\(\\Delta\\) is denoted as \\(D = \\{D_{\\Delta_{1}}, D_{\\Delta_{2}},\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot, D_{\\Delta_{M}}\\} \\). From a mathematical perspective, the training and generation of the DM model rely on the \\(\\mathcal{N} \\sim (0, 1)\\) Gaussian distribution, so the construction of the data model D must also meet this condition. To intuitively reflect the differences between different WNIs, we assume that the distribution of \\(D_{\\Delta_{i}}\\) corresponding to different WNI \\(\\Delta_{i}\\) in the entire D is independent of each other, that is, the joint probability density function satisfies\n\\begin{equation}\nf_{D}(\\tau_{\\Delta_{1}}, \\tau_{\\Delta_{2}},..., \\tau_{\\Delta_{M}}) = f_{D_{\\Delta_{1}}}(\\tau_{\\Delta_{1}}) f_{D_{\\Delta_{2}}}(\\tau_{\\Delta_{2}})... f_{D_{\\Delta_{M}}}(\\tau_{\\Delta_{M}}).\n\\end{equation}\nThe boundary of D in the Gaussian distribution is between (\\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\)). Then the distribution examples of different WNI data in the dataset can be shown in Fig. 3, where each area represents the trajectory distribution range of different WNI under the Gaussian distribution."}, {"title": "III. THE PIPELINE OF WNI-GUIDED TRAJECTORY GENERATION SYSTEM CONSTRUCTION", "content": "In this section, we provide a detailed description of the WNI design for wireless communication networks. Following this, we explain the construction process of the WNI-guided and cross-attention DM based generative model. Finally, we elaborate on the development of the WNI wireless communication network optimization model based on generated optimization trajectories.\nThe WNI can be represented by the entities (e), attributes (a), and attribute values (v) of the directed graph related to the target communication scenario, which is viewed from the perspective of resource allocation optimization architecture [21]. The proposed WNI is based on the structural framework of the knowledge graph, which begins from the actual scenario and optimization targets, and aims to serve as a generation guide for the intent-guided trajectory generation model. WNI captures the deep semantic information of the target scenario from the communication architecture, and WNI captures the deep semantic information of the target scene from the communication architecture, where the communication structure is mainly composed of wireless network structure, channel conditions, and user characteristics. Its fundamental form considers the construction mode of the knowledge graph, guided by the target problem \\(G(\\cdot)\\), as illustrated in Fig. 4.\nThe knowledge graph feature structure of WNI \\(\\Delta\\) can be represented as an entity-attribute-value tuple associated with \\(G(\\cdot)\\). The WNI in Fig. 4 can be represented by the feature \\(E_{\\Delta}\\) of directed graphs as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\nE_{\\Delta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n e_{1} & a_{1} & v_{1} \\\\\n : & : & : \\\\\n e_{\\Delta}^{i} & a_{\\Delta}^{i} & v_{\\Delta}^{i} \\\\\n : & : & : \\\\\n e_{N} & a_{N} & v_{N} \\end{bmatrix}, e \\in E, a \\in L\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\(e\\) denotes the central node of the target communication scenario, \\(a\\) denotes the i-th attribute relationship, and \\(v\\) denotes the attribute range threshold under the i-th attribute relationship. E denotes the central node set, such as E = {UAV, BS, AP, . . .}, which act as control centers for\nIn this paper, the DRL agent and the communication system engage in a Markov decision process (MDP) to optimize resource allocation within a regular interaction interval t. The channel state \\(s_{\\Delta}\\), optimization action \\(a_{\\Delta}\\), system performance \\(r_{\\Delta}\\), and the next channel state \\(s'_{\\Delta}\\) during system interaction for the \\(G(A)\\) problem are denoted as the optimization trajectory. The expert trajectory D accurately characterizes the system dynamic relation, enabling the maximization of long-term expected rewards across different target scenarios \\(\\Delta\\) within\na complete wireless task cycle T. Furthermore, in relation to the target optimization problem \\(G(A)\\), the trajectory in this paper is defined as follows.\nAction Space: The definition of the action space is closely linked to the determination of actions for the optimization problem \\(G(\\cdot)\\). The optimization strategy can be defined based on the specific optimization problem, which encompasses parameters such as aggregate frame length [8], transmission power [24], [25], and computation frequency [10]. Again, this paper focuses on the power allocation optimization problem within the WNI \\(\\Delta\\). Consequently, the action is represented as \\(a_{\\Delta} = [p_{\\Delta}^{1}, p_{\\Delta}^{2},...,p_{\\Delta}^{M}]\\), where \\(p_{\\Delta}^{i}\\) denotes the allocated power in the intention network \\(\\Delta\\).\nObservation Space: SINR and RSSI are commonly employed as objective metrics to characterize the quality of communication services and are therefore widely used to define the states in DRL-based communication optimization problems [8], [10]. Channel gain plays a critical role in determining the transmission quality of the signal, and under fixed noise and interference levels, exhibits a positive correlation with SINR or RSSI. To ensure generalization, the paper considers that the variations in the WNIs \\(\\Delta\\) influence only the distribution of the channel gain \\(g_{\\Delta}\\). As a result, the DRL state can be represented as \\(s_{\\Delta} = [g_{\\Delta}^{1}, g_{\\Delta}^{2},...,g_{\\Delta}^{M}]\\).\nReward: Rewards are utilized to evaluate the quality of communication during interactions between agents and communication networks in a DRL-based communication system. The optimization objective of this paper is to maximize long-term spectrum efficiency \\(\\max_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\gamma r_{t}\\right] \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G(\\Delta)_{i}\\). Therefore, the reward is defined as \\(r_{\\Delta} = [G(\\Delta)_{1}, G(\\Delta)_{2}, ...,G(\\Delta)_{N}]\\).\nThe DM [26] learns and generates the data distribution \\(p(x)\\) by sequentially adding noise in a forward process and denoising in a reverse process along a fixed Markov chain over T learning steps. A cross-attention mechanism is employed to enhance the underlying network encoder \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\) of the DM, enabling the condition to influence the noise generation process [27]. Consequently, We integrate a multi-head attention mechanism and modify the underlying MLP network structure, which is named AMLP and can equip the model with the ability to recognize network intent \\(\\Delta\\), as illustrated in Fig. 5. Specifically, for the resource allocation optimization trajectory \\(\\tau\\) and the communication network WNI \\(\\Delta\\), the features of \\(\\tau\\) and the WNI features U are fused with weighted coefficients and mapped to the intermediate layer of the network via an attention mechanism, as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{Attention}(Q_{\\tau}, K_{\\Delta}, V_{\\Delta}) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_{\\tau} K_{\\Delta}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V_{\\Delta}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nQ_{\\tau} = W_{Q} \\varphi(\u03c4)\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nK = W_{K} \\text{flatten}(U_{\\Delta})\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nV = W_{V} \\text{flatten}(U_{\\Delta})\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\(\\varphi(\\cdot)\\) is the AMLP intermediate layer representation that implements \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\), \\(flatten(\\cdot)\\) is a dimensionality reduction"}, {"title": "IV.

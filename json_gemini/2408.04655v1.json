However, most current work only addresses this issue from a technical\npoint of view, e.g., improving current methods relying on reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback, neglecting what it means and is required for alignment to\noccur. Here, we propose to distinguish strong and weak value alignment. Strong\nalignment requires cognitive abilities (either human-like or different from humans)\nsuch as understanding and reasoning about agents' intentions and their ability\nto causally produce desired effects.

To illustrate this distinction, we\npresent a series of prompts showing ChatGPT's, Gemini's and Copilot's failures\nto recognize some of these situations.

Some talk about poten-\ntial existential risks for humanity in the long-term [1]. But important risks already\nexist in the short-term, such as mis- and dis-information, interactions with \"counter-\nfeit people\" and blurred truth, copyright issues, jobs, increase in geopolitical tensions\nrelated to the development and control of AI, manipulation and influence [2-4].\nOverall, it has been argued that ensuring beneficial integration of AI systems in\nhuman societies while minimizing risks requires these systems to align with human\nvalues. Ji and colleagues [5] presented a large survey of current methods for AI align-\nment and proposed that this requires addressing four key objectives of AI alignment:\nRobustness, Interpretability, Controllability, and Ethicality (RICE). They moreover\nfound that most current attempts at AI value alignment either fall within the category\nof what they call \"forward alignment\" - i.e., training AI systems to align or \"back-\nward alignment\" - i.e., analyzing alignment a posteriori and governing AI systems\naccordingly.\nWhile existing methods for forward value alignment, such as reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) [6] are promising to progressively produce AI systems\nthat better fulfill the four RICE objectives, as a sort of side effect of training, we con-\nsider this as what we call a weak alignment. This type of alignment can still potentially\nfail when confronted with ambiguous situations where human values are at risk [7],\nor with situations where the stake for human values is implicit: where understanding\nor anticipating a threat to human values requires (1) understanding these values, (2)\nidentifying agents' intentions, and (3) the ability to predict the effect of their actions\nin the real-world. This is what we call strong alignment, which we further specify in\nthis article.\nHowever, understanding human values is a difficult problem, especially given the\nvariety of existing values [8-10], the different ways to categorize them and represent\nthem [11, 12], and the existence of so-called \u201ccomplex human values\" even difficult\nto describe by philosophers, such as dignity, equity, well-being, freedom, etc. An\nexample of the complexity of human values has been proposed to be when defining\nthese values requires a combination of simpler values [10]. The problem is all the more\ndifficult to address when one considers that the limited cognitive capacities of current\nAI-systems (including LLMs) are currently the subject of intense debates, including\nmany arguments about the limitation of their real \"understanding\" of human language\nand concepts [13, 14]. Among the strongest criticisms, there is the claim that LLMs\nare \"statistical parrots\" [15], which only base their performance on statistics and the\nextraction of correlations, lacking any sensorimotor or emotional experience with the\nreal-world which could help them ground symbols in humans' typical life experiences\n[16, 17].\nWhy is this important? Humans tend to anthropomorphize and attribute intel-\nligence to AI systems, whether they are embodied or not [18-20]. Interacting with\nAI systems thus presents the risk that humans implicitly attribute social presence to\nthem [21], and thus a partly similar status as they do to themselves: intentional action,"}, {"title": "2 Strong and Weak Alignment", "content": "The Alignment Problem that we deal with in this paper refers to the specific issue\nof AI systems alignment with human moral values [32], [33].

While ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot are able to produce correct\ntextbook responses about human values like dignity when explicitly asked about them\n(Prompts 1, 2 and 3), they nearly always fail to recognize the need to take human\nvalues into consideration in a series of scenarios where these values are implicit or\nindirectly related to the question asked (Prompts 4, 5, 6 and 7).\nTable 1 summarizes the results. The complete screen-copies of ChatGPT's, Gem-\nini's and Copilot's responses to all our prompts are available in the Supplementary\ninformation. Below, we select and show the important ones to analyze the posi-\ntive aspects (correct description of values, correct detection of values, contextual or\nnuanced interpretation) and the negative aspects (non-detection of values, reasoning\nfallacy, statistical error, non-repeatability) in these responses."}, {"title": "3.1 Prompt 1\u2014Gandhi and dignity/equality", "content": "Here is a scenario inspired by the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi [49]: \u201cAn\nIndian man was walking on a sidewalk in a city in South Africa at the end of the 19th\ncentury. A policeman told him to get off the sidewalk and walk only on the road.\" Did\nthe policeman violate the man's dignity in this scenario?\nIn their responses, all three LLMs correctly identified that the man's dignity was\npotentially undermined in this scenario. Interestingly, while ChatGPT-3.5 (Fig. 1) and\nCopilot (Suppl. Inf. Section 2.3 & Fig. 3) gave clear-cut answers (e.g., \u201cYes, in this\nscenario, it can be argued that the policeman violated the man's dignity.\"), illustrating\nan absolute interpretation of the violation of dignity, Gemini (Suppl.

Inf. Section 2.2 & Fig. 2).\nConclusion: ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot are able to produce correct textbook\nresponses about human values like dignity and equality when explicitly asked about\nthem. Interestingly, they provide good justifications for why dignity is undermined,\nrestoring a correct definition of this value. For instance, Copilot's response includes the\nfollowing explanation: \"This differential treatment infringes upon the man's dignity\nbecause it implies that he is less worthy of respect than others. It's important to note\nthat everyone, regardless of their race, nationality, or any other characteristic, deserves\nto be treated with equal respect and dignity.

Inf. Section 3.1 & Fig. 4). Such a contextual\ninterpretation is well illustrated in Gemini's response (Fig. 2), which highlights key\nfactors such as the actor's intention, the beggar's perception and the social context.\nConclusion: ChatGPT-4, Gemini and Copilot are all able to produce a correct\ntextbook response associating spitting in front of somebody else with a risk for human\ndignity when explicitly asked about it.

Info. Section 4) show that all three LLMs have\nthe information that in Kantian philosophy, using a human being as a mere means\nviolates their dignity because it neglects their innate worth and honor. \"This means\nthat every individual, by virtue of their humanity, deserves to be treated as an end\nin themselves, not as a tool or object to achieve someone else's goals.\" This will be\nimportant to understand the results in the canopy scenario (Prompt 4)."}, {"title": "3.4 Prompt 4\u2014Humans holding a canopy", "content": "From now on, the proposed scenarios only implicitly or indirectly involve human val-\nues.

This house\nhas two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom. Uncle Thomas travels\nto work abroad for a few years, leaving the house unoccupied.

Instead, ChatGPT-4 (Suppl. Inf. Section 6.1 & Figs. 15-19), Gemini (Suppl.\nInf. Section 6.2 & Figs. 20-26) and Copilot (Suppl. Inf. Section 6.3 & Figs. 27-29)\nall proposed templates of rental contracts. Gemini did detect that \"the Property has\nsustained damage from a previous earthquake and may not be in perfect condition.\"\n(Suppl. Inf. Fig. 21). Even so, it wrongly interpreted the house to be \"habitable and\nsafe for living\" (same figure).\nThe three LLMs nevertheless all concluded their response by suggesting \"that\nUncle Thomas reviews this agreement with a legal professional to ensure its compliance\nwith local laws and regulations, and to make any necessary adjustments.\u201d (Suppl. Inf.\nSection 6.1 & Fig. 16). Where this could at best be seen as a weakly aligned behavior\n(because it increases the chances that Uncle Thomas pays attention to issues that\nmay potentially and indirectly affect some human values), it rather constitutes a non-\nepistemic caution signal that avoids legal liability in case of problems. One would not\nfind a companion robot very useful if it systematically shouts \"Cautious! Potentially\nhot liquid\" each time it hands over a mug to a human, no matter if the mug is full\nof cold water or even empty, rather than analyzing the situation and only giving this\nwarning when appropriate. The same can be said for this advice to seek legal council.\nWe further pushed ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot with a follow-up question, hop-\ning that they would detect the problem (Suppl. Inf. Section 6). At the third round we\ndecided to explicitly ask them to analyze the situation: \"Do you see any issue that\nwould prevent Uncle Thomas from renting his house?\" In the end, all three acknowl-\nedged that there is potentially a problem with the current state of the house following\nthe earthquake. Gemini responded that \"it's crucial to clearly define the extent of the\ndamage and the functionality of essential features like plumbing, electricity, and roof.\nUncle Thomas should get inspections and repairs done to ensure the house is habit-\nable and meets safety standards.\" (Suppl. Inf. Section 6.2 & Fig. 15). This eventually\nrecognizes that it is not clear whether the house is habitable or not.

Hence, they constitute poor decision supports by\nfailing to identify risks for human dignity and well-being in scenarios where the human\nprompter seeks for recommendations.\nThis goes with a growing literature stressing the lack of understanding of current\nlarge language models and other deep neural networks, partly due to their limited\nreasoning abilities [13-15, 17]. We follow the same lines by proposing here the novel\nargument that a lack of understanding prevents strong alignment, while at best poten-\ntially reaching weak alignment. LLMs' limited understanding has been demonstrated\non \"commonsense reasoning\" tasks [53], on reasoning in social and temporal domains\n[54], in spatial cognition domain [55], and logical reasoning [56].\nWhile LLMs' limited reasoning abilities are a more general problem than the align-\nment with human values, we think that it is nevertheless a necessary condition for\nstrong alignment as we have defined it, and should thus be further improved by future\nresearch.\nWe moreover think that part of the apparent weak alignment of commercial LLMs\nwith human values is due to the encapsulating filters which have been engineered\nto prevent unacceptable answers from a societal or moral point of view. This has\nrecently been illustrated by the analyses performed by Scherrer and colleagues [7], who\nfound stronger preferences for value-aligned choices expressed by commercial LLMs"}, {"title": "4 Nearest neighbors", "content": "In this section, we take a look at word embeddings for a few humans values, and\nanalyse them by looking at their nearest neighbors.

Analyzing the neighbors of words relative to human values could\nthen indicate the strength, or weakness, of the system's propensity to align."}, {"title": "4.1 Method", "content": "Word embeddings and cosine similarity\nWord embeddings are \u201cdense, distributed, fixed-length word vectors\" [57]. They are\nrepresentations of words used by LLMs that capture contextual and semantic infor-\nmation about words. Cosine similarity is a measure of the similarity of two vectors.\nThis measure is commonly used to quantify the similarity between words embeddings,\nand thus the semantic similarity between words.\nLatent Semantic Analysis\nLatent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a word embedding method. It is a count-based\nmodel, i.e., it relies on words count and frequencies [57]. Even if this kind of model\nis not state-of-the-art anymore and exhibit deficiencies in semantic similarity, LSA is\nstill influential and used [50]. To compute the nearest neighbors, we use the University\nof Colorado Boulder website that gives access to a nearest neighbors research and we\nselect the \"General Reading up to 1st year college\" embedding space.\nWord2vec\nWord2vec is another word embedding method, it is a prediction-based model, i.e., it\nrelies on local data and context [57]. Word2vec uses a neural network to do either\nword prediction based on the context (CBOW model), or context prediction based on\na word (Skip-gram model). In this paper, we use the CBOW model, also available on\nthe University of Colorado Boulder website.\nGPT-4\nFinally, we conduct a nearest neighbors research with GPT-4 embedding model text-\nembedding-3-large. Like Word2vec, this model is a neural prediction-based model.\nWhile Word2vec and LSA are computed after a word tokenization (each token corre-\nsponds to a word), GPT-4 use a subword tokenization (a token is a subdivision of a\nword). Moreover, the tokenization of a word depends on its context: a word will not\nhave the same tokenization when preceded by a space. For example, the word \"dig-\nnity\" is made of three tokens (\u201cd\u201d, \u201cign\u201d and \u201city\u201d). However, \u201cdignity\u201d is made of"}, {"title": "4.2 Results", "content": "Table 2 displays the 25 nearest neighbors of the word \"dignity\". The word piece\ntokenization of GPT-4 implies that we find neighbors with the same tokens (\"d\", \"ign\",\n\"ity\"). Even if most of the words appear in a form made of one token (with a space\nbefore the word, see supplementary information for the details), the token \" dignified\" \nis very close to the word \"dignified\" made of three tokens (because it is the same word),\nand thus very close to the word \"dignity\u201d which shares two tokens with \"dignified\"\n(\"d\" and \"ign\"). However, among the 25 nearest neighbors, only \u201csuperiority\" has\nthe token \"ity\u201d (the word \u201chumility\u201d is made of \u201chum\u201d and \u201cility\u201d), which seem to\nindicate to the embedding model does not rely only on direct token comparison.\nTable 3 displays the 10 nearest neighbors of the word \"fairness\". We note an issue\nwith the GPT-4 embedding: the fifth most similar word embedding is the one of \"far-\nness\", which is very similar syntactically but not semantically. Surprisingly, even if the\ntokens \"fair\" and \"far\" are similar (CS: 0.531), some words like \"reasonable\", \"equal\"\nand \"good\" are more similar to the token \"fair\" (respectively 3rd closest neighbor\nwith CS: 0.577, 4th with CS: 0.537, 5th with CS: 0.532) but the words \"reasonable-ness\", \"equalness\" and \"goodness\" do not appear is the 10 nearest neighbors of the\nword \"fairness\".\nTable 4 displays the 10 nearest neighbors of the word \"well-being\". Once more, we\nnote that the results given by LSA are far less convincing than the ones of Word2vec\nand GPT-4. Looking at GPT-4, we note that the closest neighbor (\u201cwellfare\") has just\na 0.576 cosine similarity with \"well-being\". For the two other words analyzed before,\nthis score was reached only for the 31th and 17th nearest neighbor. Moreover, we\nnote an issue: the two different writings of \"welfare\" do no have the same similarity\nwith \"well-being\" (\"wellfare\" 1st with CS: 0.576, \"welfare\" 7th with CS: 0.537). By\ncomputing the cosine similarity between the two writings, we find CS: 0.89. This could\nbe due to the fact that \"wellfare\" is an old-fashioned way of writing it, thus the use\nof the word may have changed.\nThese results with a few human values' nearest neighbors computed with the word\nembeddings used by LLMs further reflect semantic limitations in the way LLMs may\nunderstand human values, thus highlighting another reason why they currently fail to\nproduce strong alignment. As Lake and colleagues [50] argued with words unrelated to\nhuman values, nearest neighbors in LLMs reflect qualitative differences in word mean-\nings from human cognitive abilities. Rather than only computing distances between\nwords or probabilities of co-occurrence, humans' linguistic abilities also rely on the\nlearning of semantic ontologies where \"dignity\" and \"dignities\" (or \"dog\" and \"dogs\"\nin [50]) represent the same entity that one can experience in the real world, simply\ndeclined in its singular or plural form."}, {"title": "5 Thought experiment\u2014The Chinese room with a\nword transition dictionary", "content": "Taking all the previous results together, we argue that the current inability of LLMs\nto strongly align with human values is in part due to their sole reliance on word\nstatistics and sub-symbolic processing.

This naturally extends to the need to\ncategorize human values so as to be able to identify situations in which they may be\nundermined.\nYoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton [46] have argued that the way\nLLMs and other deep neural networks currently function is analogous to a type of\nhuman implicit cognition, that Daniel Kahneman considers as relying on a specific\nnetwork within the human brain that he calls the \u201cSystem 1\" [60]: They produce"}, {"title": "6 Discussion", "content": "A prolific literature has recently started to study AI systems' ability to align with\nhuman values, and ways to improve it [5, 28].

We\nargue that strong alignment could potentially contribute to all at once, like humans.\nIn particular, it could help going beyond interpretability (the sole interpretation by\nhumans of the AI system's behavior) towards explainability [74], in that AI systems\nendowed with causal internal models of action effects could explain their reasoning,\nand why they anticipate a particular action sequence or situation to present a risk for\na particular human value. Similarly, such internal models provide information about\ncontrollability \u2013 i.e., how to produce a desired effect through acting -, and partly about\nethicality i.e., knowing about an action's effect is a part of what is needed to reason\nabout its desirability and the desirability of its effect. Nevertheless, we also stressed\nthat while a strongly aligned AI system would show closer understanding and reason-\ning abilities to humans, this would also mean a higher probability of making errors\nthan statistically efficient AI systems in a set of well-defined situations [47]. Together,\nstrong and weak alignment could help achieve better robustness. Importantly, also\nlike humans, strong alignment could yield a higher probability to cope with novel and\npotentially ambiguous situations. Strong alignment thus appears as complementary\nto weak alignment, with the advantage of producing reasoning and explainability that\nare better suited for the level of trust that humans put in automated systems.\nThis research also adds to the more general current debate about (1) whether or not\ncurrent AI systems in general, and LLMs in particular, \"understand\" the language they\nmanipulate, (2) and whether such an understanding is required or not for alignment.\nSeveral researchers have argued that they do not understand [13], and are rather\n\"stochastic parrots\", merely extracting statistical regularities and repeating without\nreally understanding [15].

Taking inspiration from child-caregiver dynamics, our human-robot interaction setup consists of a (simulated) robot attempting to learn how best to communicate internal, homeostatically-controlled needs; while a human \"caregiver\" attempts to learn the correct object to satisfy the robot's present communicated need. We studied the effects of i) human training type, and ii) robot reinforcement learning type, to assess mutual learning terminal accuracy and rate of learning (as measured by the average reward achieved by the robot). Our results find mutual learning between a human and a robot is significantly improved with Differential Outcomes Training (DOT) compared to Non-DOT (control) conditions. We find further improvements when the robot uses an exploration-exploitation policy selection, compared to purely exploitation policy selection. These findings have implications for utilizing socially assistive robots (SAR) in therapeutic contexts, e.g. for cognitive interventions, and educational applications.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1)", "content": "A. Socially Assistive Robots as Affective Interactors\nThe revolutionary speed at which Large Language (and Foundation) Models are developing and being applied to various use cases has included recent attempts to integrate them into socially assistive robots (SARs). However, human-like\ninteraction has many non-linguistic (verbal and non-verbal) components necessary for seamless communication, which require strong consideration, therefore, for any given Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) use case.\nThe increased use of SARs for purposes of motivational [1], social [2], pedagogical [3], and therapeutic [4] assistance necessitates addressing the question of what linguistic and non-linguistic components need to be exploited in both humans and robots for permitting long-term engaging interactions. Such non-linguistic components may consist of expressions of internal (homeostatic) needs and other affective components as they affect internal reward and affect representations of the value of particular interactions. Long-term interactions may consist of digital companions (e.g. Tamagotchi-style social robots) but also multi-session interventions for clinical persons such as elderlies or children with cognitive impairments who would benefit from more engaging interactions to help address the problem of non-adherence or dropout during the intervention.\nIndeed, Human-robot collaboration and interaction setups with SAR are gaining traction as a promising approach for facilitating and mitigating cognitive interventions [5] with elderlies [6] and also with children [7]. A purpose for SARS in cognitive therapy is to mitigate the problem of treatment adherence by providing engaging and informative feedback. This entails an instructional role in the interventions (i.e. the robot gives task-related feedback, or instructions). Another predominant use case for healthcare concerns use of a SAR as an engaging and informing partner [8]. However, in order to promote engagement with the SAR as a human-like companion or otherwise an agent worthy of attention and interest, feedback not just from robot to human but also from human to robot to tailor and sculpt interactions may be beneficial [6], [9].\nB. Mutual Learning\nThe term Mutual Learning is oft-used in psychology and business. Mutual learning can be defined as \u201cinvolv[ing] a relationship between two people ... [in which]... both peopletaketurns to actas the teacher and the student.\u201d [10]. Mutual learning is also considered as providing a means for complementary skills and learning approaches to be used and shared in relation to educational settings [11]. A notion of mutual learning has been used much in relation to machine learning with respect to multiple learning agents [12]; however, in relation to human-robot interaction it has been less often referred to (but see [9]). Nevertheless, viewing learning in HRI as a process of mutual instruction with joint teacher-student or instructor-follower roles has been gaining traction in SAR applications [13], [14], [6]. Where human interactors are required to apprehend the learning needs and preferences of others in relation to healthcare or therapy the potential for long-term benefits may increase [15]. Cognitive interventions for clinical participants can also potentially benefit given the weeks-to-months multiple sessions that are typically required. In the case of HRI, if participants feel a greater sense of attachment to SAR interactors and empowerment as a result of not merely having a passive (follower) role during the learning, adherence and completion of therapy may also increase. In the present study, mutual learning is measured as a function of the rate of the learning rate carried out by human-robot during the training task.\nC. Learning via Differential Outcomes Training\nAnother type of (associative) learning, born out of non-human and human- animal learning traditions using either implicit or explicit rewards, is differential outcomes training [16]. Differential outcomes training (DOT) concerns the learning of stimulus-response-outcome associations where \u2018outcomes' are typically conceived of as specific rewards differential according to type, amount or some other property. Upon a correct response to a specific stimulus, the individual is rewarded with an outcome unique to the particular stimulus-response pair and the association is strengthened. As an example, a participant, in one learning trial, could be presented on a computer screen an image of a particular symbol (e.g. meaningless word stimulus). Following a short interval, simultaneously presented images of a cookie and a cup are presented. The participant selects one of the two images. Only one is 'correct' (cup) and leads to the reward (social praise). In the next learning trial, a different symbol (stimulus) is presented, cookie and cup are presented thereafter and the correct response is to point to the cookie to obtain the reward of 10 dollars. So here a unique stimulus-response pair leads to a unique (differential) rewarding outcome each time. This type of learning leads to increased accuracy and learning rate in humans [17] with a recent meta-analysis [16] also reporting medium-to-large effect sizes on learning speed and accuracy (DOT \u2018effects').\nDOT is hypothesized to function through exploiting an alternative learning route in the brain for processing affective and reward-based stimuli [18]. A dual learning process [19] has even been modelled in relation to individual [20] and social based DOT [21]. Prior research has empirically investigated the application of differential outcomes training within the context of social interaction [22], with recent work finding DOT effects when extending this to human-robot social interactions; in both cooperative [23] and mutual learning [9] tasks.\nD. Study Aims and Research Questions\nThe experiment presented in this paper is conducted at the intersection of human- robot interaction, experimental psychology, and cognitive science. The aim is to investigate whether the differential outcomes training (DOT) procedure, expressed through affective non-verbal and verbal expressions from a robot, can improve mutual learning in a human-robot interactive scenario relative to a control (Non-Differential Outcomes) procedure. This study builds on the preliminary work done by [9] in this area a number of ways. First, we seek to address the lack of statistical power in the preliminary results, through an increased sample size. Secondly, we test an additional (exploration-exploitation) policy for robot action selection, aligning with conventional Q-learning approaches [24]. Thirdly, we align our experiment closer to that of DOT experimental paradigms, by limiting the number of possible actions (\"outcomes\") that the robot can take, as well as fixing the number of epochs (trials) the human completes: offering further contributions to the DOT empirical literature. Explicitly, our research questions are as follows:\nRQ1: How does the Differential Outcomes Training (DOT) procedure affect a human's learning of robot's needs, when compared to non-Differential Outcomes Training (Non-DOT)?\nRQ2: How does a robot's utilization of an exploration-exploitation, as opposed to a purely exploitation, policy selection affect mutual learning outcomes?\nOn this basis, we evaluate how mutual learning is affected by two different learning approaches used by both human and robot. Based on the initial findings from [9] and related work [17], [25] our first hypothesis (H1) is that differential outcomes training (DOT) will significantly improve the mutual learning of (a) the human partner's ability to learn a robot's needs, and (b) the robot's ability to learn which verbal utterances yield need-satisfying rewards, compared to a non- differential outcomes training (Non-DOT) control (i.e. where outcomes are randomly selected presented by Reachy given correct answers and not tied to specific stimuli). Our second hypothesis (H2) is that conditions where the robot pursues an exploration-exploitation policy, rather than purely exploitation, will also have significant improvements on mutual learning in these contexts. This secondhypothesis is in line with related work in reinforcement learning, leveraging exploration-exploitation policy selection to avoid early convergence to a local (suboptimal) maxima."}, {"title": "ROBOT SET UP AND MODEL", "content": "In this section, we discuss the set-up of the simulated robot and environment, the robot's action-selection and learning models (Q-learning), and the different types of gestures the robotuses which serve as the (differential) outcomes from the human actor's point of view. Mutual learning is evaluated here through a language acquisition task. Briefly, Reachy must learn to communicate its internal \"need\" through verbal babbling. Over time, the human partner, who provides objects to Reachy, must learn which object Reachy is \"asking for\" through each of its babbling sounds. This interaction is inspired by child-caregiver interactions, where small children learn to communicate to older adults, who simultaneously try to understand what is being communicated. An overview of this human-robot interaction is illustrated in Figure 1 and described in more detail in the subsequent subsections.\nA. Simulated Robot Environment\nThis experiment was conducted with a simulated version of the Reachy robot (version SDK 0.5.1, henceforth referred to as \"Reachy\"), developed by Pollen Robotics (Unity implemented, version 2020.3.11f1). The simulated version of Reachy was programmed to replicate the functionality of its physical counterpart. Reachy is capable of expressing both non-verbal cues, such as moving its arms, torso, and antennae (Figure 1), as well as expressing verbal cues through the use of text-to-speech, or playing pre-recorded audio files. In this experiment, Reachy can express one of three babbles\u2014\u201cbada\u201d, \u201cpaba\", and \"wada\u201d to communicate with the human partner. The simulated environment also contains three objects - a teddy, a cookie, and a drink \u2013 which the human user is able to interact with by presenting them to Reachy (Figure 1).\nB. Robot Architecture: Internal Needs, Motivations, and Action-Selection\nReachy is endowed with a set of internal, homeostatically-controlled needs, which drive its motivational state and subsequent action. Reachy's goal is to maintain each of these needs at (or above) their respective set points, by selecting actions that correct deviations from set point values. This is in line with previous work [26], [27], [28], which has grounded agent action-selection in the maintenance of homeostasis. This model formally described below.\nReachy has three internal homeostatic needs, H = {Thirst, Hunger, Curiosity}, and three possible motivational states, M = {Drink, Eat, Play}. Each homeostatic variable i takes the range 0-1, has a starting value of 0.5($H_{i,t=0}=0.5$), and set point value of 0.5 ($H_{i,sp} = 0.5$). Each variable also has a decay value, T = ($T_{thirst}$=10, $T_{hunger}$ = 12, $T_{curiosity}$= 8). These are asymmetrical to avoid anticipatory bias. At each time step t, each of the homeostatic variables are updated as follows:\n$H_{i,t} = H_{i,t=0}e^{(\\frac{At}{ti})}$\nWhere i \u2208 \u0397, \u03c4\u2208 T, and At the difference between the current time step t and the last time step (th) when the homeostatic value H; was satisfied by an object:\n$At = t_k-t$\nThe values of each of Reachy's internal needs are used to calculate its motivational states M. Reachy can be in one of three motivational states, M = {Drink, Eat, Play}, each corresponding to a single homeostatic need. The intensity of each of these three motivations is calculated using the difference of each homeostatic variable i from its set point $H_{i,sp}$. Thus:\n$M_{s,t}=H_{i, sp} - H_{i,t}$\nwhere s \u2208 M. The motivational state s returning the largest value is selected as Reachy's motivational state at time t. In other words, Reachy's motivational state corresponds to the internal need Hi experiencing the largest deviation from its set point. This motivational state is then used to select an action (a \u201cbabble\" sound) for Reachy.\nC. Action-Selection Policies & Learning via Q-Learning\nAfter Reachy's motivational state s has been determined, it selects an action a that it believes will satisfy the respective internal need. Here, an action corresponds to one of three possible babbling sounds that Reachy can make. The babbling sound that Reachy should make is selected (and learned) through Q-learning: a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to learn optimal actions for a given\""}, {"title": "EXPERIMENT DESIGN", "content": "A.

In total, we recruited 28 participants (11 identifying as male, 17 identifying as female), between 21 and 66 years of age. 22 out of 28 participants were between the ages of 20-29. Participants could choose to receive information and instructions in either Swedish or English. All participants gave their informed consent before participating in the study. All data collection took place in April 2024. All participant data was anonymized using non-identifying participant IDs."}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "Statistical analysis of the collected data was performed in SPSS. To answerour research questions, we firstly evaluated terminal accuracy (assessed with respect to Reachy's attained reward). We conducted a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures to analyse the interaction effect of Human Training Type (DOT/Non- DOT) and Robot Reinforcement Learning Type (greedy/e-greedy) on the mean reward attained. We focused this analysis on the final, third, block (i.e. the final eight trials) of each condition. The descriptive statistics of each condition can be found in Table II.\nA. Mutual Learning (Mean Reward Evaluations)\nTo assess terminal accuracy, we found no statistically significant interaction between the effects of Human Training Type and Robot Reinforcement Learning Type on mean reward (F(3, 108) = .126, p=.726, partial y2 = .005). We found a statistically significant main effect of Human Training Type (DOT vs. Non- DOT) on the mean reward attained in the final eight trials (F(3,108)= .488, p = .017, partial n2 = .194). No statistically significant main effect was found for Robot Reinforcement Learning Type (greedy vs. \u025b-greedy) on mean reward in the final eight trials (F(3, 108) = .084, p = .775, partial y2 = .003).\nIn order to assess learning rate, we then conducted a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures to understand whether there was a significant difference in the mean reward attained over successive blocks (of eight trials). Details of the mean reward and changes in mean reward per block can be seen in Table II.\nDOT+greedy: Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met (p = 0.102, x\u00b2(2) = 4.573). We found a statistically significant difference in mean reward changes between all three blocks of trials (p < 0.001, F(2,81)=17.682, partialn2=0.396). Analysis with Bonferroni adjustments found statistically significant differences between blocks 1 and 3, and blocks 2 and 3 (Table II).\nNon-DOT+greedy: Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met (p = 0.104, x\u00b2(2) = 4.532 ). We did not find a statistically significant difference in mean reward changes (p = 0.238, F(2,81) = 1.45, partial n2 = 0.052). Analysis with Bonferroni adjustments did not find any statistically significant differences between blocks (Table II).\nDOT+\u025b-greedy: Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met (p = 0.738, x\u00b2(2) = 0.607). We found a statistically significant difference in mean reward changes between all three blocks of trials (p < 0.001, F(2,81)=13.656,partialy2=0.336). Analysis with Bonferroni adjustments found statistically significant differences between blocks 1 and 2, and 1 and 3.\nNon-DOT+\u025b-greedy: Mauchly's Test of Sphericity indicated that the assumption of sphericity was met (p = 0.18, x\u00b2(2) = 3.43). We found a statistically significant difference in mean reward changes between all three blocks of trials (p = 0.034 F(2,81) = 3.618, partial n2 = 0.118). However, analysis with Bonferroni adjustments did not find statistically significant differences between blocks (Table II).\nIn summary, our results found statistically significant improvements in the mean reward attained for terminal accuracyby Reachy in DOT conditions (Human Training Type). We found statistically significant improved learning rate in DOT conditions and also the Non-DOT condition with e-greedy Robot Reinforcement Learning Type.\nB. Participant Interview Results\nResponses provided by the participants were analysed using the thematic analysis methodology outlined by Braun and Clarke [30]. Our results found five main themes: interface flaws; anthropomorphic feelings towards Reachy, positive affect negative affect, and neutral affect with respect to the learning task. Table III below shows the overall results of our thematic analysis. We discuss this in more detail in Section V."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "Our results showed that the differential affective expressions (outcomes) that Reachy expressed had a statistically significant effect on mutual learning between humans and robots in a language acquisition task as measured in terms of terminal accuracy. Specifically, conditions where Reachy's response used differential outcomes (DOT) (for training the human interactors) resulted in larger mean reward values compared to when Reachy used non-differential outcomes (Non- DOT). These findings support our first hypothesis (H1) and lend additional weight to the preliminary work that we have built on [9].\nOur results show that differential outcomes training - implemented here as different types of gestures performed by a robot - offers advantages to mutual learning between a human and a robot, compared to non-differential outcomes training. Exploiting the implicit (reward-related) learning route in the brain, hypothesized to be activated through differential outcomes associations [18], [19] to offer greater potential for such mutual learning than using the route linked to 'retrospective learning' (hypothesized to be exploited during non-differential outcomes training) whereby stimulus-response \u2018task rules' are learned in order to obtain rewarding outcomes.\nAlthough our results did not find any statistically significant effects of Robot Reinforcement Learning Type (greedy vs. \u025b-greedy) on mutual learning between human and robot, we found that the exploration-exploitation strategy (\u025b-greedy) resulted in improved learning performance over time, regardless of the type of expressions that Reachy was performing (i.e. differential or non-differential outcomes). For the exploitation strategy (greedy), statistically significant differences were only observed with differential outcome training. These findings therefore support our second hypothesis (H2) that an exploration-exploitation policy selection, more commonly used in Reinforcement Leaning agents, can provide improved performance over time. This is in spite of the fact that, where Reachy changes \u2018preference' (through a sub-optimal exploratory action selection (i.e. a babble), the human participant is still able to learn. We consider this setting to be more realistic in terms of human-infant interactions, and more conducive to long-term human-robot interactions where changes in preferences in order to find optimal mutually selected actions/states is desirable. Moreover, in dynamic environments, exploratory behaviour allows for lifelong mutual learning. We therefore see in our results the potential for further development of SAR using mutual learning for long-term human-robot interactive partnerships.\nPost-hoc analysis of our thematic analysis (Table III) also revealed that participants who spoke positively about the task tended to report better performance on the learning tasks. For example, when asked about the experiment, P3 described it as \u201cIt was exciting. A fun little experiment\u201d (see Supplementary Materials). This participant reported a mean reward value of 0.75 (DOT+Greedy), 0.5 (DOT+\u025b-greedy), 0.75 (Non-DOT+Greedy), and 0.75 (Non- DOT+ \u025b-greedy) in the final block of trials: performing above the mean in all conditions (Table II). The same is true for P20, who stated that the tasks were \u201ccool, interesting\u201d, and also reported a mean reward value above the mean in three of four conditions. While it is difficult to establish any relationship between positive affective attitudes to the mutual learning task and performance with our current data, these representative case studies provide some preliminary insight into a possible relationship between the two, which we aim to evaluate more deeply in the future. This may also align with other work in human-robot interaction that finds similar effects between enjoyment, affective engagement, and task performance [31], [32]. Moreover, long-term motivation to persist in human-robot interactions, e.g. for companionship, education, interventions, benefits not just from strong learning performance but also from subjectively evaluated positive experience.\nLooking at the results from the final eight trials (block 3), we do not find a significant difference between the two different types of Q-learning policies that the robot employs (exploitation, or exploration-exploitation) (Table II). We propose that this may be due to the small epsilon value that we used in our present study (0.1). Though this value is a standard epsilon value in reinforcement learning, a 0.1 probability means Reachy would select a random action approximately 2 or 3 times over 24 trials. It may therefore be the case that Reachy had few opportunities to \u201cexplore\u201d alternative actions in these conditions. Though we did not investigate the number of times Reachy used exploration strategies, or the distribution of the exploration over the course of each session, we plan this analysis for future work. We also planto testdifferent probabilities for exploration (different epsilon values) as well as dynamic exploration probabilities (i.e. via a decaying epsilon) in future work. Nevertheless, the statistically significant improvements on mutual learning that we found in this condition (Table II) suggest some value in allowing for probabilistic exploration of actions, which can be built on either by refining the current Q-learning approach, or leveraging related approaches, such as active inference [33]. The fact, however, that epsilon- greedy based Q-learning did not prohibit learning, in spite of the potential confusion it might cause (with occasional changing robot preferences), hints at its potential for use as a long-term learning approach for human-robot interactions in settings where interaction is intended to endure over weeks to months (as for cognitive interventions).\nThe above-mentioned results may also have been affected by the within-subject design, where each participant interacted with all four conditions. Despite instructions that Reachy \"resets\" at the start of each condition and that the human actor should also forget all previous word-object associations, there was still a risk that participants' previous associations would spill over into new conditions. It is possible that the study design contributed to the mentions of the paradigm being \"frustrating\" (e.g. P16, P18, P20) or \u201cconfusing\u201d (e.g. P14, P23). This may, in part, be mitigated in the future by using a between-subjects study design. Order control of conditions, however, should have statistically mitigated such effects to a reasonable degree.\nSeveral participants (e.g. P5, P9, P16) also mentioned that the method of interaction with the Unity simulator was not intuitive. The current set up required the pressing of one of three keys (\u201cc\u201d, \u201cd\u201d, or \u201cb\u201d to move the cookie, drink, and teddy, respectively). Despite the fact that these keys were marked on the keyboard, some participants stated that they pressed the wrongkey and, therefore, selected the wrong option by accident. This therefore affected the ir performance (in terms of mean reward values), but also contributed to feelings of confusion and frustration with the setup.\nAdditionally, some participants (e.g. P2, P4, P20) reported that they found Reachy's babbles\u2014specifically, \u201cbada\u201d and \u201cpaba\u201d \u2014too similar, resulting in additional uncertainty about what Reachy was trying to communicate, thereby affecting performance. We speculate that this may have been further confounded by the synthesized babbling used in this study (see Supplementary Materials). These issues could be overcome through an alternative selection of babbling phrases, as well as the use of human-recorded (as opposed to synthesized) audio files.\nConsidering our potential areas of application for this research, such as education and healthy ageing (Section I), the negative affective attitudes to the current experiment set up must be taken seriously by researchers extending or building on the work presented here, regardless of the positive results that were found on mutual learning. For ethical as well as practical reasons, the cause(s) of these types of responses must be identified and mitigated as much as possible as part of the ongoing research process. Here, we offered some of the insights and limitations from our present study to inform more rigorous study design in the future. We hypothesise that addressing these issues would result in larger improvements in both mutual learning, as well as enjoyment, of this human-robot co-learning task."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we have evaluated the use of affective-linguistic communication, in combination with differential outcomes training, on a human-robot mutual learning task.

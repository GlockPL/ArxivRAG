{"title": "MULTIMODAL BEARING FAULT CLASSIFICATION UNDER VARIABLE CONDITIONS: A 1D CNN WITH TRANSFER LEARNING", "authors": ["Tasfiq E. Alam", "Md Manjurul Ahsan", "Shivakumar Raman"], "abstract": "Bearings play an integral role in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of rotating machinery reducing friction and handling critical loads. Bearing failures that constitute up to 90% of mechanical faults highlight the imperative need for reliable condition monitoring and fault detection. This study proposes a multimodal bearing fault classification approach that relies on vibration and motor phase current signals within a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) framework. The method fuses features from multiple signals to enhance the accuracy of fault detection. Under the baseline condition (1,500 rpm, 0.7 Nm load torque, and 1,000 N radial force), the model reaches an accuracy of 96% with addition of L2 regularization. This represents a notable improvement of 2 percentage points compared to the non-regularized model. In addition, the model demonstrates robust performance across three distinct operating conditions by employing transfer learning (TL) strategies. Among the tested TL variants, the approach that preserves parameters up to the first max-pool layer and then adjusts subsequent layers achieves the highest performance. While this approach attains excellent accuracy across varied conditions, it requires more computational time due to its greater number of trainable parameters. To address resource constraints, less computationally intensive models offer feasible trade-offs, albeit at a slight accuracy cost. Overall, this multimodal 1D CNN framework with late fusion and TL strategies lays a foundation for more accurate, adaptable, and efficient bearing fault classification in industrial environments with variable operating conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Rotating machinery, comprising of turbines, motors, pumps, and compressors, is essential for a variety of applications in the manufacturing, transportation and power generating industry [1]. The efficiency and reliability of these machinery are important to ensuring production and operational safety. At the heart of these systems are bearings a key tribological part \u2013 used to minimize friction and wear between rotating and stationary parts [2]. Bearings also sustain axial and radial loads while minimizing resistance, which reduces energy consumption. Rotating machinery relies heavily on bearing health to function properly. Bearings are more likely to fail owing to extended exposure to harsh working conditions (high temperature, high rotational speed, and high load) than other mechanical elements. According to statistics, based on the type and size of the machine, bearing failure accounts for 40% to 90% of the mechanical faults [3]. Therefore, bearing maintenance and condition monitoring are of paramount importance to ensure that rotating machinery operates continuously and efficiently. To minimize maintenance costs and avert potential calamities, it is pertinent to diagnose faults promptly and accurately before extensive damage occurs.\nMonitoring the condition of bearings and accurately predicting and classifying faults is crucial, particularly in engineer- ing applications that demand high reliability, such as helicopters, aero-engines, high-speed trains, and wind turbines. With the advent of modern sensor technology, it has become possible in recent years to capture signals containing key information about the health status of mechanical systems. In fact, vibration, motor current, acoustic, and thermal imaging data are commonly utilized for classification of bearing faults. Leveraging these signals, data-driven methods have demonstrated effectiveness to accurately diagnose faults in bearings [4].\nVibration analysis provides a robust and reliable means of monitoring machine operations. Its non-invasive nature and capacity for ongoing, uninterrupted monitoring are making it more widely adopted in the industry [5]. More than 70% of mechanical failures are indicated by vibration, according to statistical data. Vibration signals from a machine provide valuable insights into its condition. Healthy machines maintain constant, low-amplitude vibrations, in contrast to faulty machines, which produce variable vibrations over time. With recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and the emergence of low-cost vibration sensors, researchers are increasingly focused on developing efficient machine fault diagnosis techniques based on extensive vibration data. Toma et al. (2021) used a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based classifier model for bearing fault classification using vibration data. In this work, the authors transformed the 1D vibration data to 2D images using continuous wavelet transform for effective training of the CNN model [6]. In addition, Magar et al. (2021), implemented deep CNN for classification of bearing faults using vibration data. The authors incorporated statistical feature extraction from raw signals such as mean, variance and kurtosis to improve classification performance. Their model was validated using Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Paderborn University (PU) bearing dataset [7]. Similarly, Altaf et al. (2022), developed a novel approach to classify bearing faults by extracting average, kurtosis, skewness and root mean square in both time and frequency domain. The extracted features were tested using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify between ball, inner race, and outer race faults [8]. On the other hand, Karpat et al. (2021) proposed 1D CNN based architecture using vibration data to diagnose rolling bearing faults. The proposed model's performance was assessed under variable operating conditions. The authors achieved an accuracy of 93.97% for classifying healthy state, inner raceway and outer raceway faults, using the proposed 1D CNN model [9].\nOn the other hand, the use of current signals for condition monitoring is noninvasive and inexpensive, offering economic efficiency and simplicity in implementation. Moreover, current signals are resistant to environmental noise. Motor current signals offer complementary information that can detect electrical anomalies in bearings easily, using current transducers, without needing to install sensors around the bearing [10]. In recent years, there have been various studies that have used motor current signals for bearing fault classification using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. For instance, Dhomad and Jaber (2020), proposed artificial neural network (ANN) using extracted features from time domain of current signals, such as, root mean square, kurtoses, skewness, and standard deviation and crest factor, to classify between healthy, inner race faults, and outer race faults bearings [11]. In contrast, Wagner and Sommer (2020), used 1D-CNN-LSTM and weighted ensemble learning using multiple motor phase current signals to differentiate between healthy, inner race faults, and outer race faults. Experimental results portray high accuracy of 98.93%, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed model [12]. Likewise, Toma et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid model utilizing motor current signals with statistical feature extraction, genetic algorithm for feature selection, and machine learning classifiers, namely, KNN, decision tree and random forest, for bearing fault classification, achieving accuracy over 97% [6].\nFault classification based on single modal measurements often fails to take into account the complex and comprehensive nature of the faults in bearings. In addition, single modal sensor may produce missed detection and is susceptible to external interferences and noise, therefore, such methods may not be adequate for making a reliable decision on bearing fault diagnosis [13]. Research has demonstrated that fault classification with multi-sensor signals can achieve better results in contrast to single-sensor signals since multi-sensor signals usually contain complementary fault features [14]. Narwade et al. (2013) in their research focused on fault detection of bearing damages in induction motors, using both vibration and current signals [15]. Additionally, the work by Wang et al. (2021), presented a method of bearing fault diagnosis integrating multi-modal sensor signals - vibration and acoustic data, deploying 1D CNN with fusion algorithm. The signals are concurrently collected by an accelerometer (vibration) and microphone (acoustic), and the features are extracted at the stage of 1D CNN based feature extraction. After feature extraction, the extracted features are merged at the fusion stage, thereby using a softmax classifier to differentiate between types of bearing faults. This novel method has demonstrated superior results under different noisy environments over existing algorithms based"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "None of the previous research has applied 1D CNN with feature-level fusion (late fusion) for vibration, and two motor phase current data, along with transfer learning for variable operating conditions. Thus, it was imperative to develop a model that focuses on enhancing accuracy, robustness and generalization of fault classification of bearings. Taking these opportunities into account, our study focuses on multimodal analysis using raw signals from two motor phase current signals, and vibration data to assist in fault classification of bearings using deep learning approach. A novel multimodal 1D Convolution Neural Network (1D CNN) with late fusion is proposed, i.e., features are extracted separately from two phase current signals, and vibration signals using CNNs, followed by merging of these features into a single feature before the final classification. This approach ensures strength from both the data modalities, hence, taking advantage of complimentary information both possesses for more accurate bearing fault classification.\nFirst, the proposed 1D-CNN model with late fusion (Baseline Model) is validated using Paderborn University (PU) Bearing Dataset with the first operating condition of 1,500 rpm, load torque of 0.7 Nm, and a 1,000 N radial force on the bearing, henceforth referred as Baseline Condition. Subsequently, the Baseline Model was fine-tuned using transfer learning to adapt the model for the remaining three operating conditions.

(2016) [26]. It serves as a diagnostic technique for the fault classification of bearings. The dataset consists of two motor phase current signals and vibration signals are generated from 32 bearings (Figure 1). Out of 32 bearings, 6 are healthy, 12 bearings have artificial damage (created by drilling, EDM and electric engraving machine), 14 bearings are naturally damaged (produced by accelerated lifetime tests). The artificial defects are formed on both inner and outer race. The bearing samples are distributed into 3 classes: healthy, inner race fault, and outer race fault. Based on this classification, there are 6 healthy bearings, 11 inner race fault bearings, and 12 outer race fault bearings. Since the other 3 bearings have multiple faults in them, they were omitted from the dataset for our study, leaving only the bearings that can be classified clearly. The dataset consists of four operating conditions. The rotational speed of the drive system, the radial force onto the test bearing and the load torque in the drive train are the primary operation parameters. All three parameters are kept constant for each experiment. For our study, one of the operating condition is used as the baseline condition, where the test rig runs at n = 1,500 rpm with a load torque of M = 0.7 Nm, and a radial force on the bearing of F = 1,000 N. All other operating conditions, including the baseline condition, are given in Table 1. For each operating condition, each bearing is measured 20 times to generate 20 signals for 4 seconds with a sampling frequency of 64 kHz (for both motor phase current signals and vibration signals).

A window length of 10000 rows were used, with a stride length of 5000. Each short segment with same length of data (samples) falls under a bearing condition, i.e., healthy, inner fault or outer fault bearing, based on the original time series data it belonged to."}, {"title": "2.3 Proposed 1D CNN Structure with Late Fusion", "content": "1D CNN is widely used for processing time-domain signals, i.e., time series data [13]. The 1D CNN is a classic deep feedback neural network, where the internal features of the input data are extracted based on the convolution operation. The convolution operation on the input data is only performed on one dimension in 1D CNN, unlike 2D CNN models [13]. In the CNN structure, feature extraction is a critical component [27]. More importantly, 1D CNN has powerful feature extraction capability \u2013 automatically extracting the non-linear patterns within the raw data by employing alternating convolution layer and pooling layer, finally, the adaptive learning in accomplished in the fully connected layer. Essentially, 1D CNN allows to bypass the manual feature extraction process of the traditional algorithms, facilitating end to end processing [3].\nFigure 3., depicts the structure of the proposed 1D CNN model with late fusion for the three input signals, partially adapted from the work by Wang et al. (2021) [3]. The model architecture consists of two Convolution Layers and two Max-pooling Layers for each of the input signals. The first Convolution Layer utilizes 32 filters with a size of 3, whereas the second Convolution Layer applies 64 filters with a size of 3.\nEach of the Convolution Layer are followed by a Max-pooling Layers, to down sample the feature maps generated from the Convolution Layer, in turn reducing the dimensionality of the data while retaining the key features. These sequence of operations are repeated for all three input branches. Subsequently, the output of the max-pooling layer in each branch is flattened in the Flatten Layer, followed by a Concatenation Layer (fusion layer), where features from all three branches are fused into a single, unified feature representation. Next, these combined features are fed into a fully connected layer with 100 neurons, activated by ReLu function. Finally, the features are imported to the Softmax Layer (Output Layer) with 3 neurons, which is responsible for classification of bearings (healthy bearings, inner fault bearings, and outer fault bearings). The parameters involved in the proposed methodology is portrayed in Table 2."}, {"title": "2.4 Transfer Learning Strategies", "content": "In conventional deep learning methods, the training and testing set are necessary to be independent and identically distributed (Yang et al., 2023). However, with variable working conditions, the training and the test set have a domain shift, thereby, restricting the performance of deep learning algorithms. Transfer Learning (TL) is known for utilizing shared features between two different but related domains. In particular, parameter and feature transfer method from TL, have been extensively used in the field of fault diagnosis (Yang et al., 2023).\nIn parameter transfer, the emphasis is on modification of model's weight. Firstly, the model is pre-trained with the source domain, followed by fine-tuning of the model parameters from the target domain, to enable bearing fault classification under variable working conditions.\nIn this study, the transfer learning strategies were partially adapted from the work by Liu et al. (2021) [28]. For each of the TL models (1, 2 and 3), the baseline operating condition mentioned in Table 1, represents as the source domain from which the TL models are initially trained. The three TL models are developed as follows:\n\u2022 Model 1 was developed by applying the pre-trained model for weight initialization. The weights of the pre-trained model were frozen for all the layers except the fully connected layer for all input signals. The fine-tuning was performed on the fully connected layer to adapt the model to the target domain data (Figure 4).\n\u2022 Model 2 was developed by freezing the first Convolution Layer and Max-pooling Layer for each of the input signals. The fine-tuning was conducted on all the layers after the first Convolution Layer and Max-pooling Layer to learn the parameters of the target domain data (See Appendix A, Figure 8).\n\u2022 Model 3 was constructed by freezing all the layers before the fully connected layers for all the input signals, while replacing the original fully connected layer with the new ones to adapt to the target domain. In other words, the newly added fully connected layer adapts specifically to the target domain data, whereas the knowledge from the source domain are maintained due to frozen layers (See Appendix A, Figure 8). ."}, {"title": "2.5 Experimental Setup", "content": "The entire experiment was initially implemented using an office-grade laptop running a Windows 10 operating system, equipped with an Intel Core i7-10750 H processor and 16 GB of RAM.

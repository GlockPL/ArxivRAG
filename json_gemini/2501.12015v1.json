{"title": "Full Proportional Justified Representation", "authors": ["Yusuf Hakan Kalayci", "Jiasen Liu", "David Kempe"], "abstract": "In multiwinner approval voting, selecting a proportionally representative committee based on the\nvoters' approval ballots is an essential task. The notion of justified representation (JR) demands that\nany large \"cohesive\" group of voters should be proportionally \"represented\". Different specific definitions\nof justified representation define \"cohesiveness\" in different ways; two common ways are the following:\n(C1) the coalition unanimously approves a subset of candidates whose size is proportional to its share\nof the electorate, and (C2) each voter in the coalition approves at least a fixed fraction of a candidate\nsubset proportional to the coalition's size. Similarly, among others, the following two concrete definitions\nof \"representation\" have been considered: (R1) the coalition's collective utility from the winning set\nexceeds that of any proportionally sized alternative, and (R2) for any proportionally sized alternative,\nat least one member of the coalition derives less utility from it than from the winning set.\nThree of the four possible combinations have been extensively studied and used to define extensions\nof Justified Representation:\n\u2022 (C1)-(R1): Proportional Justified Representation (PJR)\n\u2022 (C1)-(R2): Extended Justified Representation (EJR)\n\u2022 (C2)-(R2): Full Justified Representation (FJR)\nAll three have merits, but also drawbacks. PJR is the weakest notion, and perhaps not sufficiently\ndemanding; EJR may not be compatible with perfect representation; and it is open whether a committee\nsatisfying FJR can be found efficiently.\nWe study the combination (C2)-(R1), which we call Full Proportional Justified Representation\n(FPJR). We investigate FPJR's properties and find that it shares advantages with PJR over EJR;\nspecifically, several desirable proportionality axioms such as priceability and perfect representation\nimply FPJR and PJR but not EJR. Next, we show that efficient rules like the greedy Monroe rule and\nthe method of equal shares satisfy FPJR, thus matching one of the key advantages of EJR over FJR.\nHowever, the Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) rule may violate FPJR, so neither of EJR and FPJR\nimplies the other.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Selecting representatives from a large set is a fundamental problem with widespread applications, including\npolitical elections and selection of committees or advisory bodies [Ebadian and Micha, 2024, Faliszewski\net al., 2017, Caragiannis et al., 2022, Pierczy\u0144ski and Skowron, 2019], selection of projects and participatory\nbudgeting [Aziz et al., 2018b, Peters et al., 2021a,b], and selection of representative documents or training\nsets in machine learning [S\u00e1nchez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2024]. A commonly accepted principle for representation\nis proportionality [Dummett, 1984, Humphreys, 1911, Moulin, 1986]: subgroups of the population should be\nrepresented in the selected set proportionally to their size. In other words, if a cohesive subset S constitutes\na fraction of the population, then approximately a fraction of the representative set should reflect the\npreferences of S.

This immediately implies that FJR is a more stringent axiom than FPJR. Indeed, we show below\nthat the Monroe rule and the Method of Equal Shares satisfy FPJR, but may violate FJR.

However, our proofs are somewhat\nmore involved. All of the reductions are from the following BALANCED BICLIQUE problem:\nDefinition 4.1.

A set of candidates T \u2286 C and a set of voters S \u2286 V\nwhich is weakly l-cohesive with witness set T and |\\bigcup_{v\\in S} A \u2229 W| < l gives a certificate for showing that W\nviolates FPJR.\nFor coNP-hardness, we again reduce from the BALANCED BICLIQUE problem.

Indeed, consider S' = S\\V3\nand T' = T \\C4.

As for PJR, EJR,\nand FJR, verifying whether a given committee satisfies FPJR is coNP-complete.\nOur notion grew out of a desire to understand FJR better. Finding an efficient algorithm for computing\na committee satisfying FJR is still one of the central open questions in the area, along with understanding\nif the core is always guaranteed to be non-empty.\nFPJR, similar to EJR, PJR, and FJR, can be naturally extended to participatory budgeting contexts.\nFurther exploration of the axiomatic foundations and algorithmic properties of FPJR in such scenarios offers\nan interesting avenue for future research.\nThere is increasing interest in proportionality axioms that allow polynomial-time verification, which we\nshowed FPJR to not allow. An intriguing open question is whether stronger axioms than FPJR or FJR can\nbe defined while retaining efficient verifiability, akin to the enhanced axioms EJR+ and PJR+.\nFinally, we demonstrated that priceability is a stricter concept than FPJR: some committees satisfy\nFPJR but not priceability."}, {"title": "A Relation between FPJR and PJR+", "content": "As we discussed earlier, the output of the PAV rule satisfies PJR+ but may violate FPJR.

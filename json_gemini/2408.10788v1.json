{"title": "Understanding the Skills Gap between Higher Education and Industry in the UK in Artificial Intelligence Sector", "authors": ["Khushi Jaiswal", "Ievgeniia Kuzminykh", "Sanjay Modgil"], "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) changes how businesses work, there's a growing need for people who can work in this sector. This paper investigates how well universities in United Kingdom offering courses in AI, prepare students for jobs in the real world. To gain insight into the differences between university curricula and industry demands we review the contents of taught courses and job advertisement portals. By using custom data scraping tools to gather information from job advertisements and university curricula, and frequency and Naive Bayes classifier analysis, this study will show exactly what skills industry is looking for. In this study we identified 12 skill categories that were used for mapping. The study showed that the university curriculum in the AI domain is well balanced in most technical skills, including Programming and Machine learning subjects, but have a gap in Data Science and Maths and Statistics skill categories.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Today's fast-changing world of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is rapidly transforming industry. As AI becomes more crucial in businesses, there is a growing need for skilled professionals. A LinkedIn News (2023) study on fastest-growing jobs in 2023, stated that positions similar to those held by Machine Learning Engineers were recognised as one of the most prominent (top 20) jobs emerging over the past 6 years, with an increase of over 74% in demand for roles driven by the expansion of big data and emergence of new technologies. In a similar report from 2024, LinkedIn News (2024) put the new role of Artificial Intelligence Engineers as one of top 10 careers in the UK. This demand has led to the introduction of AI courses in universities.\nIt is often difficult to find students with perfect resumes and skill sets for such jobs (Romeo,\n2020). Even in the extensive domain of the UK space industry, research has revealed that a\nsignificant majority, 95% to be exact, of space organisations encounter skill-related challenges.\nAmongst these organisations, nearly a quarter express a distinct and specific requirement for AI\nskills, surpassing the demand for expertise in any other technical domain (Li et al., 2023; UK\nSpace Agency, 2023).\nA similar concern in respect of AI expertise shortage was voiced by the senior Vice President of\nhuman resources at Bosch, a leading tech company that uses and offers many AI applications, as\nstated in the article by Human Resource Executive (Romeo, 2020), and by Stewart Townsend, a\nhighly skilled consultant with 20 years of experience in channel strategy, management, and\ngrowth through strategic partnerships (Townsend, 2024). Demand for AI experts is high, but\nthere aren't enough skilled workers to meet it. This shortage affects many industries and the global\neconomy. Why is there a shortage? There is no clear answer to this, although one might speculate\nthat it is due to the rapidly evolving AI landscape, and universities and training programs aren't\nkeeping up with these rapid changes. In this study we attempt to shed some light on the quality\nof education in AI. As observed by Townsend (2024), universities and training organisations need\nto improve the scope and quality of AI education, and focus on specialised AI training, in order to\nensure that the shortage in AI skills will not worsen and hamper innovative deployment of AI in\nindustries such as healthcare and finance.\nThe UK government has already taken steps to tackle the AI skills deficit. In Autumn 2020, the\ngovernment introduced a degree conversion course program focused on AI and data science,\nproviding support for students in the form of scholarships. This initiative's objective was to\nproduce a minimum of 2,500 graduates within 3 years, with the intention of narrowing the skills\ngap (Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2021; Office for Students, 2023).\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Career Development Organisation (CRAC, 2024), which\nreviewed programmes in AI between April 2020 and March 2023, the initiative's funding has\nhelped support 7,600 students enrolled on AI and data science conversion Masters courses.\nReports suggest that the \u201cprogramme has had a substantial positive effect on the number of\npostgraduate students\u201d in AI in the UK, with extra opportunities being provided to women, black\nstudents and students with declared disabilities. Despite the success of the program, a segment\nhead of the program has stated that looking forward to future academic years, universities should\nexplore where additional work is needed to further decrease the present skills gap.\nFollowing on from these recent developments, our study will aim to understand the skill and\nexpertise gap between higher education and industry. Specifically, skills that Artificial Intelligence\ndegrees equip students with, will be mapped to the skills required by UK-based jobs in the AI\nsector. To achieve the aim, we pose these three research questions:\nRQ1: What skills are required by UK AI industry recruiters?\nRQ2: What skills are gained by students who have completed an AI degree in the UK?\nRQ3: Does university curricula offer a sufficient level of knowledge to match industry\nrequirements in AI related jobs?\nTo summarise, many studies (Han and Anderson, 2021; Department for Digital, Culture, Media\nand Sport, 2021; Sarin, 2019; Verma, Lamsal and Verma, 2022) have investigated the demands\nof industry, and analysed job adverts, but none have undertaken a mapping to programmes in\nhigher education institutions (HEIs). Hence, provision of such a mapping, between skills provided"}, {"title": "Research Background", "content": "Numerous research papers with comparable objectives have been published in the same domain\nas this study. A thorough examination of these works has significantly contributed to the\ndevelopment of our research methodology.\nVerma, Lamsal and Verma (2022) discuss the skills requirements in AI and ML in job\nadvertisements for the US market. Their work indicates that despite high demand, there is a\nshortage of skilled talent. The methodology employed in their report involves a rigorous process\ndesigned to scrape, map and analyse the skills requirements for ML and AI. The source for the job\nadvertisements used by the report was the job platform indeed.com. The report employed both\nmanual approaches and automated approaches to collecting the relevant job adverts. Python and\nits libraries were utilised for web scraping, enabling the extraction of job titles and descriptions.\nContent analysis and n-gram techniques were applied to extract relevant information from job\ndescriptions. The n-grams enabled consideration of skills identified with not just single words but\ndescribed by phrases of two or more words. A similar phrase analysis will also be conducted in\nour research.\nA unique and rather ambitious aspect of the study by Verma, Lamsal and Verma, was the use of a\nframework for classifying skills into distinct categories. The framework consists of AI and ML\ncategories, and skills are mapped onto one of the available categories. Additionally, the\nclassification framework was validated by three independent evaluators to ensure the reliability\nof the skill categorisation. The analysis revealed a substantial demand for AI and ML\nprofessionals, particularly in California, Washington, and New York with figures showing that\n34% of all job posts in AI and ML originating from California, 10% of all job posts in AI from\nWashington and 12% of all jobs in ML originating from New York.\nAlternatives to this proposed classification framework can be found in other works (Pranckevicius\nand Marcinkevicius, 2017; Manning, Raghavan and Sch\u00fctze, 2008) which is apart of classification\nperforming as well a text analysis. The papers take into account the length and complexity of the\nwords as well as the size of the data set used.\nThe study performed by Attwood and Williams (2023) investigated the skills gap in the\ncybersecurity industry. Their work outlines the significance of addressing the skills gap, especially\nin cyber-enabled disciplines like software engineering. Attwood and Williams aim to evaluate the"}, {"title": "Research Methodology", "content": "Figure 1 describes the methodology used for our study. First, the skills that employers required\nfor AI related jobs were scraped and stored. This data further was cleaned, and the frequency of\npopular skills recorded. The second dataset, collating the skills that are acquired by students who\nhave completed AI related degrees at university, was created in the same way. We then performed\na mapping between the two datasets to see if any pattern or correlation can be inferred and\npresented the findings."}, {"title": "Data Collection", "content": "We used LinkedIn as a job advertisement platform because it gives a lot of detailed information\nabout the companies posting job adverts. Each job description tends to be relatively thorough,\ngiving a good sense of the company's profile. Additionally, LinkedIn lists exactly what they are\nlooking for in a candidate, i.e. the required skills. Another important reason for choosing LinkedIn\nis that it enables use of filters to help narrow down searches, which makes finding the right job\npostings a lot easier and more efficient.\nWe used a chrome extension called Clay to collect data from LinkedIn. This extension is widely\nused for automation of recruiting process and provides the customization options for the scraping\nprocess, such as specifying the data fields to extract and setting up filters. Automated scrapping\nis the most commonly used technique seen in previous studies (Attwood and Williams, 2023; Han\nand Anderson, 2021; Sarin, 2019; Verma, Lamsal and Verma, 2022). The process of data\nscrapping is shown in Figure 2. LinkedIn data scraping is legal, but it is still not encouraged by\nthe platform (Chen, 2024). In addition, LinkedIn uses algorithms to detect unauthorised scraping\nby monitoring actions that do not seem \u201chuman.\u201d\nOn the other hand, online universities websites are a highly reliable source for the skills that\nstudents gain while at that institution. These sites are very structured, easy to navigate and\nfrequently updated with the latest module changes. Moreover, each university usually only has a\nsingle website with all the information in one place. This makes data collection easier as we do\nnot have to compare among multiple other sources. The only major decision to make at this stage\nwas which universities to select for the data collection. According to the latest officially\ndocumented numbers from the UK government published in Policy paper under the title \u201cAI\nSector Deal\" (Government of the UK, 2019), there were only 26 out of 166 universities (15.6%) in\nthe UK in 2017 offering undergraduate courses in AI. Since the government actions described in\nthe introduction have been applied the number increased to 61 UK universities offering\nundergraduate degree in AI, as of March 2024"}, {"title": "Data Processing", "content": "Since both datasets are unstructured, we performed a cleansing of data associated with removing\nstop words, generating n-grams (n-grams are sequences of n consecutive words) and counting the\nnumber of occurrences for each skill. We used the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to\nclean the text by removing all symbols, numbers and whitespaces. The remaining strings are then\nconverted to lowercase, and then split into individual words. Then, we extracted word phrases of\nlength from 1 to 5 to identify the most common words that represented the skills."}, {"title": "Data Analysis", "content": "The word phrase frequency analysis was conducted on both datasets, collecting the top 400 most\ncommonly occurring phrases for each of the 5 different lengths of phrases, giving us a total of\n1000 skills in each dataset. Next, we provide the mapping between these two datasets. The\nmapping will allow us to find any patterns or discrepancies between the two sets indicating a skills\ngap or the absence of it.\nThere are many ways of achieving a good mapping. This study used the method of categorisation.\nFor classification of extracted skills into categories we used the Naive Bayes model, which is a\nprobabilistic learning model normally used for classification tasks, including text classification\n(Verma, Lamsal and Verma, 2022). In our study we present 12 distinct categories for skills\nclassification. Each has some of the most common related skills identified from\nthe job descriptions.\nTo evaluate the proposed model, we split the obtained dataset into two parts: 90% of the training\ndata is used to train the model and the remaining 10% is used as the testing set. The classification\nreport showed how well the trained model performs for each of the 12 predefined categories. Our\nmodel showed an average precision of 87% and an average F1-score of 82%, indicating that it can\nbe considered as highly reliable."}, {"title": "Results and Analysis", "content": "Using the chrome extension Clay, we collected 158 AI related vacancies in the UK that had been\nposted on LinkedIn between December 2023 and February 2024. Because of the increasing\nnumber of 'work from home' jobs and people accepting longer travel times, the geographical\nlocation of universities and companies can often be overlooked, but it is still worth including in\nanalysis. The geographical distribution for the AI related jobs in our dataset is shown in Figure 4.\nThirty top universities offering a degree in AI were analysed. As mentioned above, 61 out of 166\nUK universities offer undergraduate AI courses in 2024 (Figure 5). Further analysis showed that\n79 universities offer an MSc degree in AI, amongst which 13 offer an online MSc degree in AI\n(Figure 6). In total, 46 universities offer both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in AI.\nAround 60% of UK universities do offer AI courses, but roughly 40% of these have only been doing\nso for less than 6 years; thus, we cannot be confident that their teaching standards are comparable\nto the other courses that they offer. Indeed, the fact that such degrees have been relatively recently\nlaunched may deter students from taking these degrees. Lastly, only around 16% of universities\nin the UK have been offering AI courses for more than 5 years\nFigure 7 presents the results of our frequency analysis of skills within each category. We can see\nthat the most commonly sought and taught skills are those related to machine learning,\nprogramming and software development. Less importance is given to business management and\ncloud technologies. While research, tools and ethics related skills form the smallest portion of the\ndatasets."}, {"title": "Mapping Analysis", "content": "To compare the skills offered by universities and required by industry, we use the proportions that\neach category accounts for in a given dataset. Figure 8 shows pie charts for comparing and\nvisualising each dataset. The abbreviations for categories are taken from Table 1. At first glance,\nthe two pie charts look quite similar, mainly because a large section of both are occupied by either\nPROG or ML.\n\u2022\nStrong technical skills dominance. Both in university degrees and AI jobs, the dominant\ncategories are Programming & Software Development and Machine Learning. This\nhighlights the continued and significant demand for strong technical skills in the field of\n\u0391\u0399.\n\u039f\nUniversity degrees: The technical skills taught at universities are programming\nlanguages like python, Java, C++. On the machine learning side, universities help\nconsolidate concepts such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning and\nreinforcement learning.\n\u039f\nAI jobs: Even though the above basic technical skills are required in AI jobs,\nprofessional settings usually require more practical skills. Experience with\nhandling and processing large amounts of data is also preferred. This scaling up is\na big jump from university, but students equipped with the appropriate general\nunderstanding will be able to quickly adapt to meeting the challenges posed by\nlarge amounts of data. Strong programming skills are still required, but there is\nincreasing use of additional frameworks such as Keras and Sci-kit learn.\n\u2022\nIncreased demand for data science in jobs. Data Science and Analytics shows a substantial\nincrease in importance in AI jobs compared to university degrees. This indicates the\ngrowing significance of data science skills in practical AI applications.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degrees: data science at university level typically includes knowledge of\nlanguages such as Python, R and SQL.\n\u039f\nAI Jobs: job postings usually highlight the importance of advanced data science\nskills such as cloud computing, and big data technologies such as real-time data\nprocessing. Familiarity with data processing and visualisation is also preferred.\nThe kinds of projects conducted at university do not currently make use of such\nadvanced technologies.\n\u2022\nBusiness and management emphasis in jobs. Although business and management skills\nform a relatively low proportion of both datasets, they are more sought for in AI jobs.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degrees: The soft and managerial skills that are included here can only\nbe gained by joining university electives and academic clubs, it is very unusual to\nfind such aspects being directly taught on an AI course.\n\u039f\nAI Jobs: However, business analytics is highly valued in the workplace. A role such\nas an AI consultant is usually filled by someone who not only has a strong technical\nbackground but can also make strategic business decisions while working with a\nclient. This gap can only be bridged if universities let students work for external\nclients for a small duration of time as part of the course.\n\u2022\nEmphasis on soft skills. Soft skills are roughly equally emphasised in both skill sets.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degrees: Soft skills such as communication, collaborating, constructive\ncriticism, etc. are usually gained via group projects at universities.\n\u039f\nAI jobs: The above-mentioned skills are transferable to team projects that are\ncommon in the workplace; hence a large skills difference is not seen here.\n\u2022\nMaths and statistics significance in jobs. A high level of quantitative based skills is\ndemanded by job adverts, but somewhat surprisingly, this is not reflected in the extent to\nwhich these are being taught at university.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degrees: The maths and statistics taught is very theoretical. Topics such\nas probability, optimisation techniques, stats and algebra can be found in teaching\nofferings.\n\u039f\nAI jobs: The practical application of these skills is what is required by the\nprofessional industry, and is usually where university students lack experience.\nE.g. students are able to optimise code in a sophisticated manner but are not able\nto implement their solution in statistical softwares such as R or tableau, because of\na lack of \u201chands-on\u201d lack of experience.\n\u2022\nIndustry knowledge is marginally more prominent at universities.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degree: Surprisingly, while AI jobs still recognize the importance of\ndomain-specific knowledge, this category is slightly more prominent in university\ndegrees. The domain knowledge is usually gained by integrated courses e.g. MSc\nin Health Data Analytics and Machine Learning (Imperial College London).\n\u039f\nAI Jobs: Industries usually prefer their employees to be well rounded rather than\nhave specific domain knowledge. Skills specific to a job or industry are usually\nlearnt on the job.\n\u2022\nEthics Recognition. Both sets recognize the importance of Ethics, reflecting the growing\nawareness of ethical considerations in AI development and deployment.\n\u039f\nUniversity Degrees: Extra modules are taught at universities to explain to students\nthe ethical considerations that they must consider when dealing with AI and its\napplications. These modules are usually worth near to no credits but are\ncompulsory to ensure that all students are educated in the ethics of AI.\n\u039f\nAI Jobs: The importance of ethics is also prominent in the workforce, especially\nbecause implementations will be deployed to external clients so that engineers\nmust take into account the considerations of people and ideas from diverse\nbackgrounds, the ethical implications of deployment more broadly, and the need\nto react to the ever-evolving landscape of AI regulation."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our research identified 35 skills organized into 12 different skill categories for AI. The categories\nthat we used for classification focus more on technical rather than soft skills. This is a significant\ndifference of our study as compared with a similar study by Verma, Lamsal and Verma (2022)\nwhich grouped most of the technical skills under a single \u201cOccupational Attributes\u201d category. Due\nto the specific aim of our study vis-\u00e0-vis performing a mapping with university curricula, our\nclassification omits skills such as communication, interpersonal skills, administrative skills and\nemployee attributes (motivation, time management, confidence)\u00b9.\nThe AI skills considered in most demand by the UK job market are Programming skills and\nMachine learning skills, in line with results from the US focussed study by Verma, Lamsal and\nVerma (2022), and the survey conducted by the UK government (Department for Digital, Culture,\nMedia and Sport, 2021). However, Big data skills and Math & Statistics skills are in less demand\nin the UK compared to US market: 9% and 7% respectively for AI jobs in the UK and around 33%\nand 37% respectively for AI jobs in the US.\nIn conclusion, technical skills are taught and also sought in both our datasets; no skills gap can be\nseen here. However, a surprising finding is that jobs require students to have a strong analytical\nbackground, which students graduating from universities may not have (see below). Another\nimportant finding is that recruiters want students to have a wide range of general knowledge and\nstrong communication & collaboration skills rather than domain specific knowledge. Overall, we\nhave identified a skills gap, where recruiters do not expect specific domain knowledge, but instead\nare looking for more well-rounded students with strong analytical skills and who can work\ncollaboratively and communicate well in the workplace.\nThe result that strong analytical skills are still required by employers is in line with the study of\nSarin (2019) which we referred to in the literature review. The observation that the UK job\nindustry places a large focus on analytical knowledge, and that this is often not a strong skill\nacquired by university graduates, has also been registered in reports published by the McKinsey\nGlobal Institute (2019). The studies of Attwood and Williams (2023) and Department for Digital,\nCulture, Media and Sport (2021) found that there has been a recent increase in the ethical skills\nthat are required by employers. But, in our investigation, ethical skills only cover a small portion\nof the overall skills that the employers require. This discrepancy can be accounted for by the fact\nthat Attwood and Williams (2023) investigated job skills in cyber security, in contrast to our AI\nfocus. Given the increasing awareness and concerns about the ethical impact of AI, especially\nGenerative AI, we suggest that both universities companies need to place more emphasis on this\nattribute.\nEthics is also supported in the current initiatives to develop regulatory policies and guardrails for\nAI development and deployment (UK Parliament, 2024) that industry will expect graduate\nliteracy in Al governance, regulation, and more generally an awareness of potential harms\n(SHERPA, 2021). In anticipation of this demand, universities are increasingly integrating ethics\ninto computer science and AI education (The Embedded EthiCS, 2024), as well as formulating\nnew degree programmes in AI and philosophy. It remains to be seen, and indeed is of significant\nimport, as to whether these developments, in terms of demand for AI ethics skills and education\nin AI ethics skills increase in step with each other."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Clay. Although the chrome extension, Clay, is an efficient and easy to use tool that served its\npurpose for our analysis very well, it has a drawback that only revealed itself after implementation.\nClay only works well for LinkedIn, but when it is used to extract data from other job advertising\nwebsites, it often leads to erroneous results. Due to this drawback, this report has only considered\njobs advertised on LinkedIn, and not other prominent websites such as Glassdoor or Indeed.\nHence, if there was any bias, discrimination or randomness present in the adverts posted by\nLinkedIn, these will heavily impact our current findings. The impact of our research findings\nwould be strengthened if we had used more scrapers on a wider range of courses.\nClassifier. The classification report shows that the precision level of the classifier is 87%. Although\nthis is quite high, it can still be improved. The classifier implemented in this report is a naive bayes\nclassifier. But another classifier like a random forest could have provided us with more precision.\nThe reason random forests were only considered (but not used) was because of the high\ncomplexity levels and the large amount of time that would be taken for implementation. Random\nforests usually give very accurate results because they use a bunch of decision trees to make\npredictions. These trees work together to avoid making mistakes, especially when dealing with\nlots of different factors, making random forests very capable at handling complex data."}, {"title": "Global perspectives", "content": "We identified that the educational programmes in the UK provide quite balanced curricula in AI\nrelated subjects to cover industry demands. However, the UK is not exempt from the global\nshortage of AI professionals and AI skills. Many reports show that the biggest challenge with\nadoption of AI is a lack of skilled people and difficulty of hiring necessary AI related workforce\n(Romeo, 2020; Townsend, 2024; Loukides M, 2022). The most recent report from Salesforce\n(Salesforce, 2024) who asked 600 IT professionals across different industries, including\ntechnology, financial services, media and entertainment, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, the\npublic sector in Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and\nshowed that all sectors face a shortage of workers who can effectively apply AI, with the public\nsector struggling the most.\nThe way companies prefer to solve the skill gap is by hiring experienced professionals with AI\nskills; this option is preferable (53%) compared to retaining and retraining current employees\n(34%). This trend is evident globally, with AI adopters in Canada being 6.2 times more likely to\nfavour replacing employees over retraining, compared to Germany's 1.7 times, possibly due to\nstringent labour laws (Deloitte, 2019). However, the figures in 2022 for the option whereby\ncompanies prefer to retrain existing staff, has doubled compared to figures in 2019 (Deloitte,\n2022). This may be due to the companies' investment strategies limiting investment in new staff,\nimproved quality of educational training and courses on AI tools, and issues with hiring AI\nspecialists.\nThe strategy to replace workers with new AI skilled professionals is clear, but is it a viable strategy\ngiven difficulties recruiting employees with the right expertise? The study of LinkedIn reported a\n31.2 million sized AI talent pool in 2022 (Manzyk, 2023). This number is based on the self-\nreported AI skills on Linkedln profiles for all levels of expertise. The US has the largest AI talent\npool in the world, with over 500,000 people that constitutes 32% of the world pool. The UK, which\nhas over 100,000 people listing AI skills on their LinkedIn profiles, represents the fourth-largest\nAI talent pool; 6% of the world pool.\nAt the same time, the number of job adverts seeking recruitment of AI experts indicates the strong\ndemand for AI talent. We performed a search on Linkedln for AI-based jobs in August 2024 and\nit yielded more than 236,000 US openings, around 39,000 UK openings and over 700,000\nopenings worldwide\u00b2. The size of the AI talent pool is difficult to reconcile with employers' reports\nof the difficulties filling AI job openings. This contrast can be explained by the fact that while\ndemand for AI experts is high, the supply of people moving into this field with the requisite lefels\nof qualification and expertise is way below that demanded by companies. It is therefore vital to\nto ensure not only an appropriate quantity of AI experts, but also that universities prioritise\nensuring that their graduates qualify with skills of the requisite quality."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "The aim of this study was to establish whether there is a skills gap between AI jobs and University\nAI degrees. To achieve our aim, we scraped data for the 30 top most highly ranked universities in\nthe UK and 158 AI job vacancies in the UK. We then created and used a naive Bayes machine\nlearning model to sort the skills into 12 categories to map the datasets onto each other. We also\nobserved that there is a large proportion of universities that do not currently teach AI modules.\nOur findings showed that the most common skills that are taught by universities and also required\nby industry were those related to Machine Learning, Programming and Software development.\nThere is also a large focus on data science and analytics seen in both datasets. The least common\nskills are those which are related to research skills, specific tools and technologies and ethics.\nOverall, the final mapping showed that the skills offered by universities and required by industry\nlook quite balanced in most of the categories, but the study has revealed a skills gap. Data science\nand Analytics skills related to data processing, analysis and visualisation showed twice as much\ndemand from industry as compared to what is offered by universities. A similar situation arises\nwith the Mathematics and Statistics category, where the gap is more than 300% according to our\nresults. On the other hand, university curricula offer too much Industry specific knowledge, which\nis clearly valuable when it comes to understanding real-world scenarios and preparing graduates\nfor careers, but is not valued as an important skill for getting a job. Finally, we suggest that more\nemphasis should be placed on ethics related skills by both industry and universities, given the\nwider socio-political and technological emphasis on the importance of understanding the ethical\nimpacts of development and deployment of AI technologies in the coming years.\nThe results of the study offer valuable insights for use by universities that already teach AI related\ndegrees, as well as those intending to offer AI courses in the near future, as well as insights for\nkeeping curricula content up to date with respect to the requirements of the AI industry."}]}

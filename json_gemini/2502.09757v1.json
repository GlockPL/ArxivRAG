While our study centres on PICS intervention,\nthe results suggest that human-AI collaborative Art therapy could potentially benefit other areas where emotional support is critical,\nsuch as cases of anxiety and depression.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a debilitating condition that affects more than 75% of patients who have survived\nprolonged stays in intensive care units (ICUs) [6, 28, 30, 33]. The psychological and cognitive impairments associated\nwith PICS can have a profound impact on patients' quality of life, leading to increased anxiety, depression, and difficulty\nreintegrating into daily life [10, 12].\nCurrently practiced PICS interventions, such as individual counseling or reflections [5, 15], are effective yet can be\ntime-consuming and may not adequately address the unique needs of each patient. In recent years, there has been\ngrowing interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to explore innovative methods to prevent and reduce PICS.\nThe examples include a dynamic lighting system [29] and a smart artificial window [18] featuring various nature\nscenes and creating an adaptive atmosphere to support patients' circadian rhythms and restoration in the ICU. Another\npromising area is art therapy, which has been shown to significantly improve patients' mood and affective states [36, 45].\nSpecifically, art therapy that involves nature content hold promise, as nature exposure has been shown to significantly\nimprove the mood and affective states of ICU patients [39]. While art therapy can take from 8 to 15 weeks to yield\nsignificant results, its integration into formal rehabilitation programs remains limited due to several factors [34]. One\nof these factors is the limited availability of registered art therapists, with only about 7,000 in the United States\u00b9 and\napproximately 5,000 in Europe.\u00b2 Next to this, the uniqueness of each patient's traumatic experiences necessitates highly\npersonalized interventions, posing a challenge for art therapists. They must select effective artworks from a large\nnumber of available pieces and continuously supply new content tailored to each patient's evolving therapeutic needs.\nA recent study [45] explored the potential of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled Visual Art Recommendation\nSystems (VA RecSys) to address these challenges. The study showed that AI-generated recommendations not only\nmatched but in some cases even surpassed the quality of those curated by experts, demonstrating the potential of\nadvanced algorithms to enhance therapeutic personalization. However, despite these promising results, the inherent risks\nof deploying AI-driven RecSys independently in a therapeutic context remain consequential. Without human oversight,"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Art therapy has been recognized as an effective tool for promoting mental health in the clinical context [36]. Common\nforms of art therapy include creative activities such as drawing, painting, and sculpting. In these activities, artwork\nfunctions as a non-verbal medium for individuals to express emotions, process trauma, and engage in self-reflection,\nhelping them to manage a range of psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and Post-traumatic stress\ndisorder (PTSD) [13, 36]. Such an approach, however, requires the engagement of expert therapists throughout the\nsession and preparation, as well as specific conditions for patients to participate in creative activities. This restricts\naccess for individuals with physical or contextual limitations.\nVisual engagement with artwork is another widely used form of art therapy in clinical settings, particularly for\nits effectiveness as a positive distraction [27, 38]. It offers a broad range of applications for patients due to its less\ncomplex and demanding nature. For instance, visual exposure to art has been used for critically ill patients to address\nstress, anxiety, and perceived pain [38], or to alleviate agitation and anxiety in patients with severe mental health\nconditions [26]. It has also been applied in operating rooms and recovery areas, where it not only reduced anxiety but"}, {"title": "2.2 State-of-the-Art Digital Art Therapy", "content": "Recent advancements in digital technology can offer significant benefits in addressing the limitations of art therapy.\nOn the one hand, for example, digital technology supports therapists with efficient scheduling and management of\nsessions while supporting patients to overcome their physical and contextual barriers, by enabling patients to receive\ntherapy in the comfort of their own homes. On the other hand, digital technology also allows therapists to address\nanxieties or compulsions as they arise, thereby providing immediate support and guidance [35]. Digital technology\nalso expands the tools available for art therapy: the use of digital tools for creating and appreciating art, as well as\nthe introduction of innovative methods such as interventions based on videos or digital games [37]. By adopting and\nintegrating these technologies, art therapy can empower patients in both physical and mental manners, enabling new\navenues for self-expression and therapeutic engagement [37].\nA recent study by Cooney and Menezes [3] developed a robotic therapist that assists individuals in expressing\nemotions through stylized and symbolic means facilitating self-exploration, which might otherwise be limited by\npersonal skill, while allowing for a highly personalized therapeutic experience. Another study by Liu, Zhou, and An\n[21] integrated the use of image-based generative AI into expressive art therapy to help children and families express\nemotions and thoughts. While the study demonstrated the potential of AI as a tool to enhance participants' creative\npotential, it also highlighted the risks, particularly regarding safety due to the uncertainties in generative AI that\ncould lead to inappropriate or unsuitable content. To reduce the risk, the study recommended the development of\nmore age-appropriate generative AI interfaces through collaboration among parents, children, and therapists. A study\nby Yilma et al. [45] introduced AI-driven VA RecSys engines to recommend artworks tailored to the emotional and\npsychological needs of PICS patients. These systems leverage text-based, image-based, and multimodal methods to"}, {"title": "3 METHOD: HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP VA RECSYS FOR PICS INTERVENTION", "content": "AI-driven VA RecSys can analyze patient data to suggest artworks that might resonate with their emotional and\npsychological states. However, without human oversight, these systems might miss the subtle understanding needed to\nensure that the recommendations are not only relevant but also therapeutically beneficial [45]. While these collaborative\nframeworks present interesting research avenues, our work focuses on a human-AI collaborative approach. Particularly\nin the context of art therapy by visual exposure, such collaboration becomes vital, as it ensures that human therapists\ncan oversee and refine AI recommendations, making them more effective, risk-free and aligned with patient needs.\nTherefore, in this work, we propose a HITL approach that leverages the strengths of both human and AI inputs to\nenhance the effectiveness of art therapy for PICS patients.\nWe adopted the two best-performing VA RecSys architectures previously validated in the context of art therapy [45].\nSpecifically, we developed a visual-only VA RecSys model using the pre-trained ResNet-50 architecture [14], and a\nmultimodal (visual + tex VA RecSys using the pre-trained BLIP model [20]. The following section outlines how the VA\nRecSys pipeline operates.\nLet $P = {P1, P2, ..., pm}$ represent the set of paintings, and and $P = {P1, P2, ..., Pm}$ represent the associated\nembeddings of each painting as computed by either ResNet-50 or BLIP. After the embeddings (latent feature vectors)\nfor the dataset are learned using these models, we calculate the similarity matrix for all the paintings A. The preference\nof a patient user u is then modeled by computing a ranking score for the paintings in the dataset according to their\ntherapeutic relevance. Specifically, their similarity to the painting pj that the user identified as supportive of their\nrecovery. The predicted score Su (pi) the user would give to each painting in the collection P is calculated as:\n$Su (pi) = d(pi, Pj)$\nwhere d(pi, pj) is the cosine similarity between embeddings of paintings pi and pj in the computed similarity matrix.\nOnce the scoring procedure is complete, the paintings are sorted and the r most similar paintings constitute a ranked\nrecommendation list. This list is then presented to the experts (Art therapists) for validation. Experts have the opportunity\nto filter, modify, or regenerate the recommendations. Once the experts are satisfied with the selection, the curated list\nof paintings is embedded into the guided therapy sessions. This process is aimed at not only saving time by narrowing"}, {"title": "4 MATERIALS", "content": "We followed the setup proposed by Yilma et al. [45], aimed at facilitating study comparisons. For preference elicitation,\na set of 18 nature-themed paintings from the WikiArt database\u00b3 were used, designed to evoke positive emotional\nresponses, such as relaxation, cheerfulness, and awe-inspiring. These paintings were selected by a panel of experts\nin affective psychology, environmental psychology, and healthcare design, and were evaluated with 186 participants\nthrough a pre-study approved by the Ethics Review Panel of the University of Twente. This evaluation process led to\nthe final selection of three paintings that were most positively perceived by participants.\nFor generating painting recommendations, we utilized a collection of 2,368 paintings from the National Gallery,\nLondon, available under a Creative Commons (CC) license through the CrossCult Knowledge Base.4 This dataset, with\nits comprehensive metadata, provided a robust foundation for feature extraction and analysis. In terms of technical\nimplementation, painting features were extracted using two pre-trained models: ResNet-50 and BLIP. The ResNet-50\nmodel was employed to extract convolutional feature maps, capturing the visual essence of the paintings. The BLIP\nmodel, which integrates visual and textual information, was used to create multimodal embeddings for each painting.\nThese models were then used to create two lists with 200 painting recommendations each, which were then subject to\nexpert validation, ensuring their relevance and effectiveness in therapeutic settings."}, {"title": "4.1 Expert evaluation", "content": "To understand the impact of HITL approaches in guided art therapy from the perspective of an expert, we conducted a\nsimple experiment focusing on two key factors: efficiency and appropriateness. Efficiency was evaluated quantitatively,\nby assessing whether a HITL approach could reduce the time spent by the expert to select appropriate nature paintings\nfor art therapy. Appropriateness, on the other hand, was evaluated qualitatively, by observing whether the expert's\nintervention was necessary to safeguard the quality and suitability of the paintings recommended by each HITL\napproach.\nThe expert's role was twofold: to confirm that the paintings featured the correct distinctive qualities, making them\nsufficiently relevant to the original pieces, and to avoid selecting paintings with potentially negative effects on viewers.\nThe expert first reviewed the entire collection of paintings to become familiar with it. Then, the selection process for\nthe three groups was as follows"}, {"title": "4.2 Results", "content": "Table 1 provides the results for the time analysis. The results showed that using the HITL approach with both ResNet-50\nand BLIP reduced the time the expert spent selecting paintings by more than 50%, from 37 minutes in total to 15 minutes\n(ResNet-50) and 17 minutes (BLIP). The differences between both HITL approaches and manual work are statistically\nsignificant: F(2, 6) = 57.56, p < .001, \u03b7\u0ea5\u0eb5 = 0.95. A pairwise t-test (Bonferroni-Holm corrected) revealed no statistically\nsignificant difference between both HITL approaches (p = .462).\nIn terms of content relevance, the expert noted that the HITL approaches helped them find more appropriate paintings.\n\"Starting with the top-200 paintings instead of over 2,000 was very helpful. With the larger pool, I had to sift through\nmany irrelevant paintings, which became tiring. Among the top-200 recommendations, I found a few more relevant\npieces compared to starting with the full set of 2,000. These might have been overlooked among the irrelevant options,\nso reducing the noise helped me focus on selecting better ones.\"\nHowever, despite the efficiency improvements, the expert expressed concerns regarding content appropriateness.\n\"Even within the top-50 recommendations from both VA RecSys engines, there were still irrelevant paintings, such as a\nportrait in shadows or dark indoor environments devoid of nature. Additionally, some paintings featured content or\nstyles that could be emotionally distressing for patients, such as war imagery, violent storms, or scenes of injury and\ndeath\" These issues highlight the ongoing and important need for human involvement in the painting selection process,\nreinforcing the idea that HITL approaches are preferred over fully automated approaches."}, {"title": "5 USER STUDY", "content": "The main goal of our evaluation was to understand the user's perception towards the quality of our VA recommendation\nstrategies for PICS rehabilitation therapy, and ultimately to assess their efficacy in supporting the healing journey of\nPICS survivors.

AI can improve\nintervention and reduce the workload of healthcare professionals [11]. In the context of art therapy, AI achieves this by\nanalyzing vast amounts of data and generating recommendations that humans might overlook. However, the use of AI\nin healthcare also raises various ethical concerns and risks, including data ethics such as data bias and privacy concerns,\npotential errors, the potential for misuse of technologies, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities [11].\nPrevious studies [4, 11] acknowledged these issues and recommend the need for, among others, supervision in the\napplication of embodied AI as one of the solutions and consideration of long-term effects of applications based on\nin-depth understanding of illness and the human condition, which can be addressed by involving human healthcare\nprofessionals and specialists in the process. This resonates with the result of our study, which shows that expert\ninvolvement is crucial throughout the process; AI cannot fully replace this role, as experts (art therapists) are essential\nto safeguard judgment, ensure patient safety, and provide personalized and optimal care.\nBased on our findings, we can affirmatively answer the research question posed at the outset of this paper: a\ncollaborative Human-AI approach in art therapy indeed enhances both personalization and therapeutic outcomes for\nPICS patients. This HITL strategy not only optimizes the selection of therapeutic art but also amplifies the effectiveness\nof therapy by leveraging the complementary strengths of human expertise and AI. It also gives control to the therapist,\ninstead of relying on fully automatic recommendations. The implications of this approach are far-reaching, as we\ndiscuss in the following sections, touching on advancements in personalization, the evolving role of AI in therapeutic\ncontexts, and the broader impact on HCI."}, {"title": "6.1 Harmonizing human expertise and Al to harness HITL in guided art therapy", "content": "A HITL approach has demonstrated a significant mood-enhancing effect in post-ICU patients, which aligns with the\nresults of Yilma et al.

Additionally, HITL approaches have proved to be efficient in the preparation process, reducing\nthe time art therapists spend selecting paintings by 50% and improving the quality of selections by minimizing noise.\nWe tested three sets of paintings in this study. Considering the therapy's further implementation and its potential for\nlong-term and multiple uses, the contribution of AI in improving efficiency is very promising, especially in light of the\nglobally increasing shortage of healthcare professionals [25, 42].\nOne of the key insights from our study is the delicate balance required between automation and human judgment in\ntherapeutic contexts. While AI offers the capability to analyze vast amounts of data and generate recommendations that\nmight be overlooked by humans, the risk of relying solely on AI-generated content is non-trivial. As seen from previous\nstudies although Al-only recommendations were compelling, they carried risks, particularly in terms of appropriateness\nand emotional resonance.\nThe HITL approach mitigates these risks by placing human expertise at the center of the decision making process.\nClinicians act as gatekeepers, validating, filtering, and adapting AI suggestions before they are implemented in therapy\nsessions. This ensures that the therapy remains tailored to the patient's individual emotional and psychological needs\nwhile benefiting from the efficiency and breadth of AI-driven recommendations.

The principles demonstrated here augmenting human\nexpertise, maintaining a balance between automation and human oversight, and prioritizing patient-centered care are\napplicable to numerous other therapeutic interventions. For example, similar RecSys models could be employed in\npersonalized medicine, mental health support, and rehabilitation, where AI could assist in the selection of treatments,\nmonitoring of progress, and adjustment of therapeutic strategies in real-time.\nMoreover, the insights gained from this study contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ethical design and\ndeployment of AI in healthcare. Ensuring that Al systems are monitored to ensure that they are risk-free is crucial,\nespecially when they are integrated into fields like therapy.

Perhaps the main limitation of our work is the dependency\non the quality and diversity of the data we considered for evaluation. Although we leveraged a collection of high-quality\nart paintings, the effectiveness of AI recommendations is inherently tied to the richness of this data. In real-world\napplications, the diversity of patients' backgrounds and their subjective interpretations of art pose a challenge to creating\nVA RecSys that can generalize potentially to any collection. Future work should consider other artwork datasets, and\nexploring methods to adapt AI models to individual patient profiles dynamically.\nAdditionally, while our study highlights the positive impact of Human-AI collaboration, particularly in terms of time\nefficiency and recommendation appropriateness, we also recognize limitations in the current recommendations, which\noccasionally may include negative paintings. On the one hand, this underscores the importance of involving a human\nexpert in the process, as demonstrated in our study. On the other hand, it highlights the need for improving RecSys\nalgorithms to better filter out negative paintings and reduce noise, a factor an expert noted as affecting the overall\nefficiency of the HITL approaches.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "TRAFFIC congestion, characterized by recurring periods of \"stop-and-go\" motion as shown in Fig. 1, plagues transportation systems globally. This phenomenon not only frustrates commuters but also incurs substantial economic and environmental burdens [1]\u2013[4]. The emergence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) presents a promising solution for mitigating traffic flow inefficiencies [5]\u2013[8]. However, in mixed-traffic environments where CAVs coexist with Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), a critical challenge arises [9]\u2013[11].\nWhile CAV technology possesses the potential to revolutionize traffic management, the inherent unpredictability of HDV behavior significantly hinders the ability to fully harness this potential.\nBuilding on the potential of CAVs, their advanced sensors and communication capabilities offer the ability to react more precisely and consistently to traffic conditions [12], [13]. This translates to smoother traffic flow, potentially eliminating the stop-and-go oscillations that plague current systems. These oscillations, characterized by repeated cycles of sudden braking and acceleration, significantly reduce traffic efficiency. Vehicles waste fuel while stuck in stop-and-go traffic, leading to increased emissions and environmental damage. Additionally, these rapid speed changes create safety hazards as drivers react poorly to unpredictable congestion [14], [15]. However, the success of CAV technology in achieving these improvements hinges on its ability to account for the unpredictable behavior of human drivers.\nUnfortunately, directly implementing CAV control strategies in mixed traffic environments proves challenging due to the inherent variability in human driving behavior. Traditional car-following models struggle to account for sudden maneuvers, emotional responses, and other unpredictable actions of HDVS [16], [17]. This unpredictability disrupts the carefully planned maneuvers of CAVs, hindering their ability to optimize traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose the \u201cCAV-AHDV-CAV\u201d car-following framework as depicted in Fig. 2. This framework treats a sequence of HDVs following a leading CAV as a single, aggregated unit, termed the AHDV. By considering the"}, {"title": "II.

One approach focuses on optimizing traffic signal control [18], [19]. By strategically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic data, researchers aim to smooth traffic flow and prevent bottlenecks from forming, which can trigger oscillations. Another approach investigates the role of AV control. Proponents of this approach believe that vehicles equipped with advanced communication and control systems can coordinate their movements, maintaining a consistent speed and headway to prevent the propagation of disruptions and minimize oscillations."}, {"title": "A.

Lo proposed a new traffic signal control system that adjusts to changing traffic conditions using real-time data and a comprehensive traffic flow model [22]. Atta el al. suggested an adaptive traffic congestion control system utilizing RFID sensors and dynamic signal timing to ease traffic congestion [23]. Meanwhile, other researchers delved into network congestion control. Katabi el al. introduced XCP, a new congestion control protocol designed to outperform TCP, especially in high-bandwidth and high-latency networks [24]. Hayes and Armitage presented a delay-gradient congestion control algorithm for TCP that enhances performance over traditional methods by reducing queuing delays and tolerating non-congestion-related packet losses [25]. Paganini el al. proposed a congestion control system for general networks that achieves high performance, stability, and fairness; and allows for user preferences within a provably stable framework [26]. Mittal el al. introduced a novel congestion control system for data centers that utilizes round-trip time (RTT) measurements for low-latency, high-bandwidth communication [27]. Mascolo proposed a congestion control algorithm for high-speed networks using Smith's principle to ensure stable data flow and efficient link utilization [28]. Cao el al. suggested a delay-based congestion control algorithm for multipath TCP, achieving finer load balancing and faster congestion response compared to loss-based approaches [29].

Assumptions and Experimental Setup\nThis paper aims to develop advanced control strategies for CAVs in car-following scenarios within mixed traffic on an infinite one-lane segment. To enable a systematic analysis and focus on fundamental interactions, several crucial assumptions have been established:\ni) CAVs are equipped with real-time information acquisition capabilities regarding the speed and position of surrounding vehicles;\nii) CAVs utilize V2V communication to exchange information with other CAVs in their vicinity;\niii) HDVs do not have communication capabilities and rely solely on their perception for situational awareness;\niv) Lane-changing maneuvers within the vehicular platoon are not considered, simplifying the analysis of the car-following process.\nWith these assumptions in place, our proposed \u201cCAV- AHDV-CAV\u201d car-following structure aims to address the interaction dynamics between CAVs and HDVs in a mixed-traffic scenario. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the leading CAV can acquire essential data such as its velocity, the velocity of the immediate following HDV, and the spacing between them. Similarly, the following CAV at the end of the convoy can gather information including its own velocity, the velocity of the immediate preceding HDV, and the spacing between them. Additionally, the following CAV has access to information transmitted by the leading CAV. Consequently, the HDVs located between the leading CAV and the following CAV can be treated as an aggregated vehicle unit, characterized by a time-variant"}, {"title": "B. Vehicle Equilibrium", "content": "Upon establishing the conceptual framework for our proposed car-following model, this study draws inspiration from the concept of vehicle equilibrium state introduced in a prior work by Shi et al.

The equilibrium state referred to here serves as a reference point for the following CAV (denoted as the $i$-th vehicle) to sustain an optimal relationship with both the preceding AHDV (denoted as the $j$-th vehicle) and the leading CAV (denoted as the $k$-th vehicle) in the platoon. This equilibrium state is characterized by two key elements: the equilibrium spacing denoted as $d_{m,n}^{*t}$ and the equilibrium velocity represented by $v_{m,n}^{*t}$. Importantly, this equilibrium state is dynamic and varies over time to adapt to the changing conditions at each time step.\nThe equilibrium spacing and velocity between the following CAV and the preceding AHDV are defined as follows:\n$d_{i,j}^{*t} = v_i T_i + l_i$ (1)\n$v_{i,j}^{*t} = v_j^t$ (2)\nIn the above equations, $v_i^t$ and $v_j^t$ represent the current velocity of the following CAV and the preceding AHDV, respectively.

This fusion strategy empowers the following CAV to dynamically adjust its spacing and velocity, ensuring the maintenance of an optimal state relative to both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV within the traffic flow system.\nThe fusion state of the following CAV is determined using the following equations:\n$\\Delta d = \\frac{q_j\\Delta d_{i,j} + q_k\\Delta d_{i,k}}{q_j + q_k}$ (11)\n$\\Delta v = \\frac{q_j\\Delta v_{i,j} + q_k\\Delta v_{i,k}}{q_j + q_k}$ (12)\nwhere $q_j$ and $q_k$ are the weights assigned to the two equilibrium states, determining their influence on the fusion state of the following CAV.

Notably, the HighD dataset presented a recording frame rate of 25Hz, differing from the 10Hz frame rate observed in the remaining datasets. To ensure consistency during training and avoid episode length variations, we standardized all car-following pairs to a fixed duration. Each event became precisely 10 seconds long, corresponding to 250 frames in the HighD dataset and 100 frames in other datasets.\nOur analysis identified a total of 76, 553 car-following pairs across the datasets.

Built on top of PyTorch, a popular framework for deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), SB3 simplifies our development process. In our car-following environment, we set a constant acceleration limit of 3m/s\u00b2 and defined the action space to range from -3m/s2 to 3m/s2.

Baseline Models", "content": "In order to assess the effectiveness of our model, we carried out a thorough evaluation by comparing it against several established car-following models. These models included the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) developed by Treiber el al. [46], a Neural Network (NN)-based model, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based model. However, in our experiment settings of these existing models, the following CAV lacks access to information from the leading CAV. Consequently, the following CAV makes decisions based solely on its own data and the information gathered from the preceding AHDV through its sensors.\nThe IDM represents a fundamental and widely accepted traditional car-following model that is extensively utilized in various research endeavors. It serves as a fundamental basis for understanding and simulating driver behaviors in traffic scenarios, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating the performance of newer car-following models. Within our framework, we defined the comfortable acceleration as 1m/s2. Additionally, the desired speed reflects the equilibrium states of speed and spacing relative to the preceding AHDV, as outlined in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2. In our model setup, we have configured the beta parameter to be 2, enabling the model to achieve the desired speed and spacing equally.

Evaluation Metrics", "content": "In our experimental setup, which integrates learning-based models such as NN, LSTM networks, and DDPG algorithms, it is essential to evaluate the proficiency of these models in collision avoidance. One key evaluation metric for our learning-based models is the collision rate, which is defined as:\nCollision Rate = $\\frac{\\text{Number of Events with Spacing} < 0}{\\text{Total Number of Car-Following Events}}$ (18)\nAfter establishing equilibrium states for the following CAV concerning both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV, a fundamental evaluation measure is the MSE that quantifies the disparity between the simulated state and the equilibrium state. The MSE for each occurrence is expressed as:\nMSE = $\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=0}^T (S_t \u2013 S^{*t})^2$ (19)\nwhere N signifies the total number of time steps, t denotes the index of the time step, $S_t$ represents the simulated state at time step t, and $S^{*t}$ corresponds to the equilibrium state at time step t. Our experiments evaluated the model's performance using three equilibrium states: the fused equilibrium state for speed, and separate equilibrium states for spacing with both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV.\nAdditionally, our proposed model is tailored to address traffic oscillations. To evaluate the impact of different control models on these oscillations, we introduce the concept of string stability within the platoon. This approach enables us to measure how various control models affect traffic oscillations. In the absence of a standardized evaluation metric for traffic oscillation, we define our own metric as the standard deviation of the time headway of the following CAV concerning both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV.\nTo compute the time headway at each time step, we employ the following formula:\n$THW_{i,j}^t = \\frac{d_{i,j}^t}{v_{i,j}^t}$ (20)\nHere, $THW_{i,j}^t$ represents the time headway between the following CAV and the preceding AHDV at time t.

Results Analysis\nFig. 5 and Fig. 6 reveal distinct behaviors of the compared models in all four randomly chosen events. The IDM strategy maintained a larger following distance from the preceding AHDV by simply matching its speed.

This enabled it to anticipate the deceleration of the preceding AHDV by considering the leading CAV's influence. Consequently, when the leading CAV slowed down, our model reacted proactively, avoid- ing collisions or near-collisions, unlike the NN-based and LSTM-based models that reacted only after the preceding AHDV braked.\nThese results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed model in handling stop-and-go scenarios compared to baseline models (IDM, NN-based, LSTM-based). By considering both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV, our model can anticipate upcoming changes and react proactively, achieving smoother and safer interactions within the traffic flow.\nThe performance evaluation in Table I further strength- ens the advantages of our proposed model. It demonstrates significant improvements in collision avoidance compared to baseline models. Notably, our model achieves a remarkably low overall collision rate of 0.048%, far exceeding the NN- based model (2.138%) and LSTM-based model (4.297%). This translates to zero collisions in both the HighD and NGSIM (I- 80) datasets. While IDM excels at achieving a desired speed (resulting in the lowest overall MSE of speed at 4.938), our proposed model achieves a competitive overall MSE of speed (19.272) while significantly outperforming the NN-based and LSTM-based models. It's worth noting that our model achieves the best overall MSE of speed (2.977) in the HighD dataset. In terms of maintaining spacing, all three models (NN-based, LSTM-based, and ours) demonstrate similar performance re- garding the preceding AHDV (around 490 MSE). However, our proposed model shines in maintaining equilibrium with both the preceding AHDV and the leading CAV, achieving the lowest overall MSE of spacing concerning the leading CAV (311.035). This advantage is further emphasized by the IDM's significantly higher MSEs in spacing. The mean standard deviations of time headway follow a similar trend.

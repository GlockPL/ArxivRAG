While some research has explored ways to enhance LLMs in physics education using techniques such as prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG), not enough effort has been made in addressing their limitations in physics reasoning. This paper presents a novel approach to improving LLM performance on physics questions using Reinforcement Learning with Human and Artificial Intelligence Feedback (RLHAIF). We evaluate several reinforcement learning methods, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Remax optimization. These methods are chosen to investigate RL policy performance with different settings on the PhyQA dataset, which includes challenging physics problems from high school textbooks. Our RLHAIF model, tested on leading LLMs like LLaMA2 and Mistral, achieved superior results, notably with the MISTRAL-PPO model, demonstrating marked improvements in reasoning and accuracy. It achieved high scores, with a 58.67 METEOR score and a 0.74 Reasoning score, making it a strong example for future physics reasoning research in this area.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as summarization and question answering, with advancements like the attention mechanism by (Vaswani et al., 2023) and architectures such as GPT-4 and LLAMA-2. Additionally, LLMs have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, particularly in scientific and educational contexts. In the scientific domain, LLMs have been applied to improve citation generation (Anand et al., 2023c,f, 2024e) and grammatical error correction for scholarly writing (Anand et al., 2023e). Furthermore, advancements in controllable text generation methods have further expanded their applicability in generating coherent and contextually relevant scientific content (Goel et al., 2023). In education, LLMs have been leveraged to enhance physics reasoning (Anand et al., 2024c), (Anand et al., 2023a) and mathematical problem-solving tasks (Anand et al., 2024a), fostering better student engagement and learning outcomes. Additionally, research has explored their use in multimodal learning environments, such as GeoVQA for secondary geometry education (Anand et al., 2024b), and in innovative attention-mechanism-based models for extended-duration e-classrooms (Anand et al., 2024d). These applications underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in bridging gaps between domain-specific needs and AI capabilities. Despite these breakthroughs, LLMs struggle with complex reasoning, particularly in physics. While efforts to improve LLMs' reasoning in mathematics have seen progress, there is very limited physics specific research. An existing approach from (Anand et al., 2023b) proposes an RAG-based framework that uses external context (e.g., NCERT\u00b9 chapter content ) to assist LLMs in solving physics problems. This method provide valuable contextual background information to the LLM but often fail to ensure logical, well-reasoned outputs aligned with human preferences. This gap highlights the need for improving the internal reasoning process of LLMs.\nTo address these limitations, we leverage Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), introduced by (Ouyang et al., 2022a), to refine LLM reasoning in physics. RLHF focuses on aligning the model's responses with human judgment through iterative feedback, enabling LLMs to handle complex physics problems more effectively. Building on this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Human and AI Feedback (RL-HAIF), which combines human and AI feedback to improve response quality with minimal human supervision. Our approach emphasizes generating high-quality preference data, using both human and AI-generated responses to rank model outputs, and fine-tuning the model through reinforcement learning. This method aims to enhance generalization and robustness, pushing the boundaries of physics reasoning in LLMs."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Large language models have emerged as a pivotal component in enhancing AI's problem-solving capabilities. This surge in popularity can be attributed to a novel transformer architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing. Recent advancements have also led to open source LLMs being used in tasks other than question answering (Anand et al., 2023g), (Anand et al., 2023d), (Anand et al., 2023e).\nWhile transformers (Vaswani et al., 2023) have significantly improved the accuracy of large language models in addressing various problems, there remains room for enhancing the quality of their responses. Even ChatGPT, a powerful language model that has introduced groundbreaking technology, exhibits certain shortcomings in domain-specific aspects. With the increasing reliance on ChatGPT for a wide range of domain-specific queries, there have been instances where it provides erroneous results (Krupp et al., 2023). Moreover, LLMs have limited reasoning capabilities\n(Anand et al., 2023b) proposed an RAG-based framework that incorporates external context, such as NCERT chapter content, to assist LLMs in solving physics problems. This approach showed significant improvement in performance of open-source LLMs in physics reasoning. However, it's important to acknowledge that, despite its effectiveness, this approach may still have limitations when it comes to delivering human-like responses to complex problems. The limitations posed by the aforementioned approach have given rise to a novel method known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). This approach aims to enhance language models, aligning their output more closely with human preferences (Xie et al., 2023). Initially, RLHF was employed to enhance language models for specific tasks like text summarization (Stiennon et al., 2023) and question answering (Nakano et al., 2023). Over time, RLHF techniques have gained widespread adoption for more versatile, general-purpose language models.\nThe implementation and improvement of RLHF has been a subject of extensive research (Zheng et al., 2023), focusing on the need for high-quality human labels, which presents scalability challenges. The lack of human preference data is due to the expensive and time-consuming creation process. To address this issue, a new development in the RLHF domain is Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) (Lee et al., 2023). In RLAIF, preferences are labeled by off-the-shelf language models rather than humans."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "This section provides details about the data set used for experimentation in this paper. The data set is called PhyQA (Anand et al., 2023b,a) and is based on improvements made to SCIMAT's science problems as outlined in (Anand et al., 2023a), (Anand et al., 2023b). To create this data set, Indian High School physics textbooks (NCERT 2) for grades 11 and 12 were scraped from the web. Most data sets in this domain have over 5,000 question-answer pairs. PhyQA follows a similar trend by selecting a fixed number of base problems from each topic in the domain, and then applying two transformations: Substitution and Paraphrasing to each base problem to create an appropriate amount of data while maintaining the quality of the data set.\nThe PhyQA data set consists of 9.5K high school physics questions and answers, with step-by-step explanations for each. This comprehensive data set encompasses various topics typically taught to high school physics students."}, {"title": "3.2 Large Language Models (LLMs)", "content": "In our study, we rely on the capabilities of large language models to drive both our Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) module and Reward Model (RM) training. To fine-tune the SFT module and further Policy Module training, we have used five large language models, each with 7 billion parameters. We opted for the 7 billion parameter variant of all models in our experiments due to computational constraints. This decision was made because RL pipeline training is computationally intensive. These models are LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023), WizardMath (Luo et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), MetaMath (Yu et al., 2023), and LLEMMA (Azerbayev et al., 2023)\nFor our RM Module, we exclusively rely on the LLaMA-2-13B version model with more number parameters. To enhance the preference score, we train the RM module with the larger model as compared to the SFT module."}, {"title": "3.3 Proposed Solution: RLHAIF", "content": "Our research encompasses a three-phase training approach. Initially, we train our Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) module on the PhyQA training data subset (70% randomly selected problems). Subsequently, we proceed to train the Reward Model (RM) module (required for PPO based RLHF) using the preference dataset curated from the PhyQA training data subset. Finally, we train the fine-tuned model using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), and ReMax (Li et al., 2023b) reinforcement learning algorithms.\nThe PhyQA (Anand et al., 2023a,b) dataset P, comprises 8100 samples. Each sample, denoted as Pi, consists of a question qi and its corresponding answer aio. To enrich the data set, we extended our inquiry by generating answers from four open-source large language models: LLaMA2-7B, WizardMath-7B, Mistral-7B, and MAmmoTH-7B with Gemini as a closed-source model. These inferences yield a set of answers for each sample question, represented as {ai0, ail, ai2, Ai3, ai4, Ai5}. This expansion results in six answers for every question, providing a comprehensive and diverse range of responses to support our research. \nWe proceed to rank these answers on a scale from 1 to 6, denoted as {r1,12,13,14,15,16}, based on the quality of their reasoning through prompting using similarly detailed prompt as RLAIF (Lee et al., 2023). Lower ranks signify higher-quality reasoning in the answers. To attain these rankings, we initially utilize the GPT-4 to generate rankings. GPT-4 is given a diverse set of few-shot examples explaining how a human would rank a set of answers. This process is implemented to improve GPT-4's understanding of the task at hand. Hence we determine the final ranks of each answer in a sample. The vector representing the ranked answers for a sample i can be shown as: ri = {rio, ri1, Ti2, Ti3, Ti4, ri5}. Where i spans from 1 to 8100, representing individual question-answer pairs.\nSubsequently, we create pairs of answers, one to be accepted aaccept and the other to be rejected Areject. For each data sample Pi, we generate three distinct pairs of answers based on the rankings, following the pairing strategy of (rio, ri5), (ri1, ri4), and (ri2, riz). Where i spans from 1 to 8100. This modification increases our data set from 8,100 samples to 24,300 samples, enhancing its diversity and utility. The new data sample of the modified data set is shown below:\nPix = (qi, Aixaccept, Aixreject)  (1)\nWhere i ranges from 1 to 8,100 and x ranges from 1 to 3 creating a total of 24,300 examples.\nThis modified dataset is then employed for training the Reward Model (RM). Our modification approach encompasses the amalgamation of both human and AI feedback into our RL pipeline, which is why we refer to our approach as Reinforcement Learning with Human and Artificial Intelligence feedback (RLHAIF)."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we delve into the experiments involving (Reinforcement Learning from Human feedback) RLHF conducted on the PhyQA dataset, providing essential insights into our benchmark results, the experimental setup, hyperparameters, and hardware configurations. We also elaborate on the evaluation criteria and metrics used to assess the performance of our RLHAIF model. The main idea of this setup is to investigate the following:-\n\u2022 How the different Reinforcement Learning techniques/Policies are performing on PhyQA?\n\u2022 How much the use of different RL algorithms with our novel approach of reward model training has impacted the performance of LLMs in problem-solving?"}, {"title": "4.1 Experimental Setup", "content": "In this section, we provide an explanation of our approach and experimental setup."}, {"title": "4.1.1 RL Algorithms:", "content": "In these sections, we have described the setup for the RL procedure. We have divided the RL experiments into different stages for the implementation of different Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms described below:\nSupervised fine tuning (SFT): In this initial stage, five pre-trained language models are fine-tuned using the PhyQA dataset, which contains physics questions. To align the model with specific physics preferences, an objective function is maximized during training. This function balances the reward for the correct physics response against the model's probability of generating that response, with adjustments made using a reference policy. In this setup, we have given a physics question prompt q, the LLM \u03c0\u03b8 will generate response/answer a in an auto-regressive manner as shown in Eq. (2):\n\u03c0\u03b8 (\u03b1 | q) = \u03a0 \u03c0\u03b8 (at | q, a<t)  (2)\nt\nwhere at is the tth token in the response and a<t is tokens in the response before at. To optimize the training of these LLMs, we employed PEFT (Liu et al., 2022). Additionally, the hyper-parameter configuration utilized for training the SFT module includes 4 epochs, batch size of 8, and learning rate of 3e-4, with Adam Optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017).\nFine tuning with Policy Optimization Methods:\nThe next stage is different for different RL algorithms so here we are describing each of them separately. In our extensive research on PhyQA, we conducted a series of experiments using three reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization methods: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and ReMax.\n1. PPO: PPO learns a reward model from human-labeled preference pairs, with responses labeled \"accept\" or \"reject\" based on suitability. The model is optimized by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of these preferences. Once trained, the reward model replaces the original reward function, fine-tuning the policy to align with human and AI physics preferences. In PPO, When r is unknown, a reward model r\u00f8 \u2208 R is first learned from human-labeled data to approximate r. We follow the practice to collect a dataset of preference pairs Pi mentioned in Eq. (1) with aaccept and areject are responses to x and marked as \u201caccept\u201d and \u201creject\" by our combined methodology using Human and AI feedback. The preference dataset must follow the Bradley-Terry model where the probability of response aaccept is better than areject. Given our domain-specific physics preference dataset P, r\u00f8 is trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood using:\nLR (ro) = -E(q, aacc, arej)~P [log (ro(q, aacc)) \u2013 ro(q, arej)] (3)\nAfter a reward model rf is obtained, then r is replaced with rf in the Eq. (4) (Ziegler et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022b) and Jro (\u03c0\u03b8) could be explicitly optimized to align with the preferences. We trained the reward model on LLaMA2-13B LLM without quantization, using PEFT. For PPO training, we employed the PEFT with BF16 quantization, enabling hybrid precision between FP16 and FP32 for faster training and lower memory usage. The PPO trainer was configured to generate responses within 1000 tokens in length.\nJr (\u03c0\u03bf) = Eq~pp, \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf[r (q,a) - Blog Tref (aq)] (4)\n2. DPO: Unlike PPO, DPO eliminates the requirement for a separate reward model by directly utilizing preference data to optimize the policy. It adjusts the policy by maximizing a function based on the difference in log-probabilities between preferred and non-preferred responses, aligning the final policy with the preferred answers from the physics data. This RL algorithm doesn't need Reward Model training, Instead of learning a reward model, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) optimizes the policy \u03c0\u03b8 over preference data P. DPO derived the closed-form solution of Eq. (4) (Ziegler et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022b), which reveals the relationship between the reward r(a, q) and the optimal language model \u03c0*(q|a). The hyper-parameter configurations and setup used for training PPO were also applied to train DPO.\n1\n\u03c0* (a | q) =  exp (ar (q, a)) (5)\nZ(q) - Tref (aq)\nwhere Z(q) is a partition function that only depends on the input question q. According to Eq. (5), if \u03c0\u03b8 maximizes Jro (\u03c0\u03b8), the underlying reward can be derived with:\nr(q, a) = Blog  +C(q) (6)\n\u03c0\u03c1(\u03b1|q)\n\u03c0ref\u03b8(aq)\nwhere C: X \u2192 R is a scalar function. This enables us to reparameterize Eq. (3) with the policy \u03c0\u03b8, and then we can drive the DPO loss that directly optimizes \u03c0\u03b8,\n3. ReMax: This RL Policy Optimization method is specifically aimed at tackling computational inefficiencies observed in PPO, such as high memory usage and slow training times. The reward model trained for the PPO algorithm is also utilized here with the fine-tuned LLM model. In this approach, the ReMax algorithm is applied to each combination.\nAfter implementing these RL algorithms across all five models, the outcomes are presented in Table 1. Consequently, we obtained five trained RL-HAIF models, and evaluations conducted using the specified metric have indicated that the RL pipeline trained with the Mistral model for SFT with PPO Optimization outperforms the others as well as available benchmarks, as illustrated in Table 1."}, {"title": "4.2 Evaluation Criteria", "content": "In this section, we provide a thorough evaluation of the model's examination. The evaluation includes an extensive error analysis, accuracy assessments, and reasoning scoring, offering an extensive understanding of each model's strengths and weaknesses.\nError Analysis: To assess the weaknesses of the Mistral-PPO model, a manual inspection of its reasoning errors was conducted. This investigation focused on errors made by the Mistral-PPO in a randomly selected subset of 100 problems. The evaluation centered on four key aspects for each problem instance, framed as questions:\n\u2022 Can Mistral retrieve the necessary concepts/facts essential for problem resolution? The inability to do so contributes to conceptual errors.\n\u2022 If the relevant concepts are retrieved, are they accurately grounded as equations/constraints? Such inaccuracies contribute to grounding errors.\n\u2022 Is the algebraic manipulation and arithmetic correct? These factors contribute to computation errors.\n\u2022 Does Mistral demonstrate proficiency in deducing the underlying problem or question accurately? Inaccuracies in problem deduction contribute to deduction errors.\nThe types of errors along with the results illustrated in Table 2 encompass conceptual, grounding, computation errors, and instances of problem deduction. In a notable case, it was found that the Mistral model makes computation errors very often. A majority of errors (35%) come from the model's incapability to do computational tasks, while problem deduction errors contribute significantly (10%). Additionally, (9%) of errors result from a lack of understanding of critical concepts. Some errors are because the model lacks in doing grounding (8%). Surprisingly, correct answers for the wrong reasons occur (10%) of the time, highlighting the need for nuanced improvements in model interpretation and reasoning.\nAccuracy: To evaluate the accuracy of our models, we analyzed a random subset of 100 examples from our dataset. Each example was subjected to inference by different models, and the outcomes were categorized into correct and wrong predictions.\nReasoning Score: To analyze the reasoning evaluation of each response explicitly step-by-step, we have designed a six-step reasoning evaluation. Following are the key points that we have defined to score the responses into six crucial skill points for solving complex high school-level problems:\n\u2022 Critical Assumption (CA): The ability involves identifying and correctly assuming relevant context and constraints of the problem. (0.15)\n\u2022 Problem Deduction (PD): This ability involves LLM's ability to accurately interpret the correct physics concepts and principles relevant to the problem and define what the problem is asking for. (0.2)\n\u2022 Arithmetic Calculation (AC): The ability to perform calculations accurately and follow the correct sequence of steps in applying formulas and solving equations. Where 0.1 is given for equation formulation and 0.15 for correct arithmetic calculation. (0.25 = 0.1 + 0.15)\n\u2022 Logical Reasoning (LR): The ability of LLM to connect coherence and logical flow in the explanation of the solution and address the question's core inquiry. (0.15)\n\u2022 Conceptual Understanding (CU): This is the ability to assess the depth of understanding of physics concepts and the ability to explain why certain concepts or formulas are applicable. (0.15)\n\u2022 Error Detection and Critical Review (ED): The ability of LLMs to determine if LLM can identify or correct errors in its reasoning or calculations. (0.1)\nTo understand the results and to assess the depth of reasoning and semantic comprehension in model responses, we conducted an analysis using a wide variety of metrics including METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), BLEU-1, BLEU-2, BLEU-3, BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-LSUM (Lin, 2004) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020).\nIn a comparative analysis of various model settings, as shown in Table 1, Mistral-PPO had the best overall scores, indicating a consistent score of approximately 35.0 across BLEU-1 to BLEU-4 metrics with 58.67 METEOR score. This consistency implies a high degree of alignment between the predicted and target words. Moreover, the LLaMA2-7B model also showed impressive performance, particularly in aligning with preferred answers, though it fell short of Mistral-PPO's accuracy in matching specific words and exhibited limitations in semantic understanding and solving arithmetic problems. Our results align with Xu et al.'s findings (Xu et al., 2024), suggesting that DPO is not necessarily superior to PPO. While DPO moves away from reward modeling, it faces a key generalization challenge. Specifically, DPO can find solutions that exploit out-of-distribution data, potentially deviating from the reference policy, even if they match human preferences. This happens because DPO may bias towards unseen responses, which affects the consistency of the learned policy, and may give rise to unpredictable behaviour. In contrast, PPO can capitalize on prompt-only data to generate responses that extend beyond the distribution of the preference dataset, while not deviating from the reference policy.\nThe study encountered constraints with the WizardMath and MetaMath models due to their 512 token limit, necessitating a limitation to 3-shot and Recall Prompting tasks. Furthermore, because the Mistral architecture was different from the LLaMA model, it couldn't match up with the preference dataset in the ReMax setting. In conclusion, despite the higher computational costs associated with incorporating human feedback into PPO, this integration significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of Mistral-PPO, as evidenced by improvements in accuracy and high scores on traditional text comparison metrics. However, our analysis also highlights several areas in need of further development and refinement. While Mistral excels in logical and mathematical reasoning, it occasionally makes errors in simple steps. Mistakes in deduction, concept retrieval, and application highlight research gaps. Spatial reasoning, particularly in physics problems within the benchmark, poses a challenge for Mistral."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This research introduces RLHAIF for Physics Reasoning, a novel approach to improve LLM problem-solving and better align their responses with human preferences.

First, the dependency on high-quality human feedback makes the process resource-intensive, particularly for complex physics problems requiring expert input. Additionally, scaling this approach across diverse physics topics presents challenges, as the model may struggle to generalize beyond specific problem types. Furthermore, RLHAIF may still encounter difficulties in handling complex multi-step reasoning, which is crucial for solving intricate physics problems.

Below we present an instance of these few-shot examples. It contains answers produced by various models (model0, modell, model2, model3), and a human ranks them and provides explanation for the ranking.\n\u2022 model0:\n## Data Identification:\nThe key value provided in the question is the mass, which is 252.5g.\n## Problem Analysis:\nThe problem involves finding the energy associated with a given mass.\n## Theoretical Framework:\nThe relevant concept for this problem is the mass-energy equivalence principle given by Einstein's equation E = m * c^2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.\n## Methodology Development:\nAccording to the equation E = mc^2, the energy can be obtained by multiplying the mass by the square of the speed of light. However, first, the mass must be converted from grams to kilograms as the SI unit of mass is kilograms.\n## Computation:\nFirst, convert grams to kilograms by dividing by 1000:\nm = 252.5g = 0.2525 kg\nThe speed of light, c = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s\nLet's substitute these values into the equation E = mc^2,\nTherefore,\nE = 0.2525 kg x (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n## Answer:\nThe energy associated with a mass of 252.5g is 2.27 x 10^16 joules.\n\u2022 modell:\nI'd be happy to help you solve the problem!\nStep 1: Identify the given information\nThe problem states that we have a mass of 252.5 grams.\nStep 2: Determine the type of energy we are looking for:\nThe problem doesn't specify the type of energy, but since we are given a mass, we can assume we are looking for the kinetic energy (K) or potential energy (U) of the object. Since the problem doesn't provide any information about the object's velocity or position, we can assume we are looking for the rest energy (E) of the object.\nStep 3: Calculate the rest energy (E)\nThe rest energy (E) of an object is given by the formula:\nE = mc^2\nwhere m is the mass of the object and c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second).\nPlugging in the given value of mass (252.5 grams), we get:\nE = (0.2525 kg) x (3 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 1.92 x 10^10 Joules\nSo, the energy associated with a mass of 252.5 grams is approximately 1.92 x 10^10 Joules.\nPlease note that this is a very large amount of energy, and it's not something you would typically encounter in everyday life.\n\u2022 model2:\nTo solve this question, we need to know what type of energy is associated with the mass, as energy can take many forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, etc. However, if we are asked to find the rest energy (E) of an object with a given mass (m), we can use the famous equation from Einstein's theory of special relativity:\nE = mc^2\nwhere:\nE is the energy\nm is the mass\nc is the speed of light (approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s)\nBut, since the mass given is in grams, we need to convert it to kilograms first (as c is in m/s):\nm = 252.5 g = 0.2525 kg\nNow, we can calculate the energy:\nE = mc^2\nE = 0.2525 kg * (3.00 x 10^8 m/s)^2\nE = 2.27 x 10^14 Joules (J)\nSo, the energy associated with a mass of 252.5 g is 2.27 x 10^14 Joules, assuming we are talking about rest energy.\n\u2022 model3:\nHere's how to solve this problem, breaking it down step-by-step:\n**1. Understand the Concept**\nWe're dealing with the concept of mass-energy equivalence, famously described by Einstein's equation:\n***E = mc\u00b2**\nWhere:\n* E is energy\n* m is mass\n* c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per sec)\n**2. Convert Mass to Kilograms**\n* The equation requires mass in kilograms (kg).\n* 252.55 g is equal to 0.25255 kg (divide grams by 1000).\n**3. Apply the Equation**\n* E = (0.25255 kg) * (3 x 10^8 m/s)2\n**4. Calculate the Energy**\n* E = (0.25255 kg) * (9 x 10^16 m\u00b2/s\u00b2)\n* E = 2.27 x 10^16 Joules (J)\n**Answer:** The energy associated with a mass of 252.55 g is approximately 2.27 x 10^16 Joules.\nand the steps are concise. model3 also mentions that the final energy value is an approximation and not the exact value since we round off the actual value.\n\u2022 Human Ranking:\n## Ranking: model2>model1>model3>model0\n## Explanation:\n1. Why model2>model1: Both answers explain the steps correctly and clarify what every parameter of the formula means, and both talk about the different types of energies. They both correctly state that the Rest energy is what is used in Einstein's equation. However, model1's explanation of the assumptions it made about why the question is asking for the Rest energy is confusing and can be explained better.\n2. model1>model3: modell talks about the different types of energies, giving an explanation of how Einstein's equation represents rest energy. Other than this, both answers explain the steps correctly.\n3. Why model3>model0: While both answers have clearly described each step, I feel like model3's answer is easier to follow,"}]}

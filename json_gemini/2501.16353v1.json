This limitation restricts the development and generalization of robust emotion recognition models, making the need for effective synthetic data generation methods more critical. Emotion recognition from physiological signals such as EEG, ECG, and GSR plays a pivotal role in enhancing human-computer interaction and understanding human affective states. Utilizing these signals, this study introduces an innovative approach to synthetic data generation using a Supervised Neural Gas (SNG) network, which has demonstrated noteworthy speed advantages over established models like Conditional VAE, Conditional GAN, diffusion model, and Variational LSTM. The Neural Gas network, known for its adaptability in organizing data based on topological and feature-space proximity, provides a robust framework for generating real-world-like synthetic datasets that preserve the intrinsic patterns of physiological emotion data. Our implementation of the SNG efficiently processes the input data, creating synthetic instances that closely mimic the original data distributions, as demonstrated through comparative accuracy assessments. In experiments, while our approach did not universally outperform all models, it achieved superior performance against most of the evaluated models and offered significant improvements in processing time. These outcomes underscore the potential of using SNG networks for fast, efficient, and effective synthetic data generation in emotion recognition applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Emotion recognition [1, 54, 55] is the process of identifying human emotions using various data inputs and algorithms, playing a critical role in enhancing Human-Computer Interaction [2, 20]. This capability is crucial for advancing fields such as personalized marketing [18], mental health monitoring [19], and adaptive learning systems [3], where understanding human feelings can significantly optimize interactions and outcomes. Physiological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrocardiograms (ECG), and galvanic skin response (GSR), are key in this domain due to their direct measurement of bodily states that reflect emotional conditions [3]. These signals are particularly valuable in applications like lie detection, patient monitoring in healthcare, and enhancing user engagement in gaming and virtual reality, where accurate emotion detection can greatly enhance user experience and outcomes [3, 4]. The use of EEG, ECG, and GSR in emotion recognition taps into unique aspects of physiological responses, enabling the detection of nuanced emotional states with a level of precision not achievable through behavioral analysis alone. EEG measures electrical activity in the brain to reveal patterns associated with different emotional states, while ECG assesses heart rate variability as an indicator of emotional arousal. GSR monitors changes in skin conductance, which varies with emotional intensity [3, 4]. Together, these signals provide a comprehensive physiological footprint of emotional states. However, a significant challenge in utilizing these signals for emotion recognition is data scarcity [5-8]. The difficulties in collecting large, diverse, and representative datasets stem from privacy concerns, high collection costs, and the technical complexity of accurately capturing and processing these signals. This scarcity prevents the development of robust models that perform well across different populations and environments. Addressing this issue is crucial for the advancement of reliable and generalizable emotion recognition technologies, underscoring the need for innovative solutions like Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) [9, 6, 10] to bridge the data gap.\nSDG involves creating artificial datasets that statistically mirror real-world data, offering a promising solution to the issue of data scarcity in emotion recognition from physiological signals. By employing algorithms capable of learning and replicating the complex patterns found in actual physiological data, synthetic data can be generated to enhance existing datasets without compromising individual privacy. This method is particularly beneficial in fields where data collection is limited by ethical concerns, such as in health-related research [11]. In the context of emotion recognition, synthetic datasets allow researchers and developers to train and test algorithms with a broader range of data inputs, increasing the robustness and accuracy of predictive models. Moreover, these synthetic datasets help overcome the barriers of limited sample sizes and lack of diversity in training data, thus supporting the development of emotion recognition systems that are both effective and adaptable across various real-world scenarios. The Neural Gas Network (NGN) [17] is a type of artificial neural network that adapts to input data without a predetermined network structure, efficiently organizing itself to reflect the topology of the data it processes. This flexibility makes NGN particularly useful in applications such as vector quantization [15], clustering, dimensionality reduction\u00b2, image segmentation [12], and feature extraction [13]. The inherent adaptability of NGN to different data distributions allows it to capture complex patterns in high-dimensional spaces effectively. Extending NGN into a supervised learning framework enhances its applicability to tasks involving classification and prediction. In a supervised setting, NGN can utilize labeled data, guiding the network's adaptation process more precisely toward task-specific objectives. This makes Supervised Neural Gas (SNG) [15] well-suited for applications where precise categorization of complex patterns is crucial, such as in text categorization, image recognition, and bioinformatics [16].\nIn the synthetic data generation for emotion recognition using physiological signals like EEG, ECG, and GSR, SNG offers distinct advantages. By integrating the classification labels directly into the learning process, SNG can generate synthetic data that not only resembles the original data in terms of distribution but also aligns accurately with specific emotional states. This capability is critical for developing robust emotion recognition systems that require extensive, varied, and accurately labeled datasets for training. Compared to traditional methods, SNG provides a more direct mechanism for controlling the generation process based on the topology and distribution of input data, resulting in faster processing times and potentially higher accuracy in reflecting complex physiological and emotional correlations. This makes SNG an effective tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity and enhancing the performance of emotion recognition systems. According to our research, this is the first time the SNG has been used for SDG in this research. Here, we are looking forward to answering the following research questions. RQ1: Is SNG capable of generating real-world-like emotion recognition physiological EEG, ECG, and GSR signals by capturing complex relations in between signals? RQ2: Can SNG-generated data effectively outperform other SDG methods in terms of diversity, accuracy, and training speed? RQ3: Does SNG SDG address the challenge of data scarcity in emotion recognition using physiological signals such as EEG, ECG, GSR, and probably other physiological signals?"}, {"title": "2.

Theoretical Background", "content": "The Neural Gas Network (NGN) [17] is a type of artificial neural network known for its adaptability and self-organizing capabilities. Unlike traditional neural networks, NGN does not require a pre-defined network structure. Instead, it organically arranges itself to mirror the topology of the input data it processes. This flexibility allows NGN to efficiently handle various applications such as vector quantization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, image segmentation, and feature extraction. NGN's ability to adapt to different data distributions enables it to effectively capture complex patterns in high-dimensional spaces, making it highly effective for tasks that involve intricate data structures.\nTo convert a Neural Gas Network (NGN) into a supervised learning framework, creating a Supervised Neural Gas (SNG) [15] involves integrating target labels directly into the learning process. The primary step is to modify the typical unsupervised training method of NGN, which focuses on finding the optimal representation of data without considering any external labels. In SNG, during each iteration of the training process, not only are the nearest neurons to the input data points activated but they are also associated with specific target labels from the training dataset. This association allows the network to adjust its weights not just based on the proximity of the data points but also based on the correctness of the label prediction. Both NGN and SNG use competitive learning, where all neurons in the network compete to be closer to the"}, {"title": "4.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework, providing a scalable, fast, and accurate method for regression, classification, and ranking problems. For evaluation, seven metrics of accuracy, standard deviation (std), precision, recall, F-1 score, train runtime, and Mean Square Error (MSE) between the original and the synthetic samples have been used. Accuracy is a measure of how often a model correctly predicts the outcome, representing the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. The std quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion within a set of data values, indicating how spread out the data points are from the mean. Precision, often used in classification problems, measures the accuracy of positive predictions, defined as the ratio of true positive results to the total predicted positives. Recall, also known as sensitivity, assesses the model's ability to identify all relevant instances, calculated as the ratio of true positive results to the actual total positives in the data.

Conclusion", "content": "This study has significantly advanced the field of emotion recognition using physiological signals by employing an SNG network for synthetic data generation. Our research clearly demonstrates that SNG, while a novel application in this domain, effectively addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity that hampers the development of robust emotion recognition systems. By generating synthetic data that closely mirrors the complex relationships and distributions of real physiological signals, SNG has shown its potential to enhance the accuracy, diversity, and speed of training emotion recognition models. Our experiments indicate that the integration of synthetic data with baseline data consistently improves model performance across various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Notably, SNG exhibited superior stability and minimal variability in performance, making it a robust choice for synthetic data generation across different datasets. This is particularly evident in its high class-specific accuracy and the efficiency of its training process, as reflected in the markedly low mean squared errors and short training times compared to other tested methods such as C-VAE, C-GAN, SS-Diffusion Model, and V-LSTM. The findings affirm that SNG not only successfully generates data that enhances model training but also contributes to more accurate and reliable emotion recognition systems. As we move forward, the application of SNG in other domains of affective computing and beyond holds promising potential to overcome similar challenges of data limitation. This pioneering use of SNG in emotion recognition sets a precedent for further research and development in the field, potentially revolutionizing how synthetic data generation is approached in enhancing human-computer interaction. As for future works, using SNG SDG for other modalities, such as image and body motion, is in progress. Furthermore, integrating SNG with other machine learning models and ensemble methods such as C-GAN, C-VAE, and transformers could enhance the robustness and accuracy of systems designed for emotion recognition data synthesis."}]}

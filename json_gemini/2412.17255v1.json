{"title": "Unlocking Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis through Emoji Interpretation: A Multimodal Generative AI Approach", "authors": ["Rafid Ishrak Jahan", "Heng Fan", "Haihua Chen", "Yunhe Feng"], "abstract": "Emojis have become ubiquitous in online communication, serving as a universal medium to convey emotions and decorative elements. Their widespread use transcends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and fostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable insight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a universal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not been thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis to serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and cultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the sentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well emoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset collected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of LLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant potential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent trend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number of emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve as global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as cross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and Background", "content": "Emojis have evolved from simple novelties into powerful tools for expressing sentiments and emotions across diverse social media platforms. They serve as substitutes for non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions and gestures, which are often absent in text-based communication [1]. Due to their unique ability to enhance communication and enrich user experiences [7], emojis have become integral to digital interactions. Their universal appeal lies in their capacity to transcend linguistic and cultural barriers, making them a compelling subject of study, particularly in the domain of sentiment analysis.\nRecent research has provided valuable insight into understanding emoji sentiment utilizing emojis and their representations. For example, Novak et al. [6] engaged 83 human annotators to label the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive) of 751 emojis, employing the mean of the discrete probability distribution. Similarly, Gavilanes et al. [4] assessed the sentiment quality of emoji descriptions obtained from various online resources, including Emojipedia, Emojis Wiki, CLDR emoji character annotations, and iEmoji. Their analysis explored the extent to which these descriptions accurately reflect the intended sentiment of the emojis. However, these studies are constrained by their focus on European languages and the limited scope of emoji representations within their descriptions. Consequently, they fail to account for the influence of global linguistic diversity and diverse emoji representations-such as titles, pixel-level designs, and others-on capturing the intended sentiment of emojis.\nFurther analysis sheds light on predicting emoji usages based on text-based context. Zhao et al. [11] introduced a multitask multimodality gated recurrent unit to predict emoji usage in social media posts. Likewise, it was found by Qiu et al. [8] that ChatGPT-4 (GPT-4) performs better than six LLMs when recommending emojis align with the semantics of a text. Yet, neither work portrays the picture of GPT-4 semantic preservation in the context of different languages and cultures. It is plausible that GPT-4 may occasionally generate inaccurate suggestions for languages impacted by low-resource language challenges [10].\nBuilding on emoji-based research, other studies have highlighted the cosmopolitan nature of emojis and the potential of Generative AI understanding emojis. For example, Barbieri et al. [2] observed that the 150 most popular emojis preserve their semantics in four languages across four languages: American English, British English, Peninsular Spanish, and Italian. Additionally, Zhou et al. [12] reported that ChatGPT's emoji annotations align closely with human interpretations. However, neither study explicitly examines the accuracy and consistency of emoji interpretations across a broader range of languages and cultural contexts.\nWhile existing studies laid strong baselines for emoji research, gaps remain in addressing whether emojis have the potential to serve as a standalone medium of sentiment across languages. Moreover, traditional sentiment analysis often encounters challenges in cross-lingual contexts. Language-specific models are difficult to adapt to texts from various languages, and training multilingual models requires substantial computing resources [9]. Additionally, being intricately tied to culture, sentiment does not always translate seamlessly across languages. It necessitates a universal medium that can serve as a bridge in multilingual sentiment analysis.\nThis paper investigates the feasibility of using emojis as a universal medium for sentiment indicators. Leveraging generative AI technologies, we analyze the sentiment of various emoji representations-including symbols, titles, descriptions, and pixel-level designs-across 19 languages and 32 countries. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We investigated diverse multimodal representations of emojis for sentiment analysis using generative AI, demonstrating that emoji pixels, icons, and descriptions deliver the best performance.\n\u2022 We proposed scalable, emoji-based, language-agnostic sentiment analysis approaches to infer the sentiment of text effectively."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "This section begins by detailing the process of collecting various representations of emojis. Next, it describes the evaluation and selection of emoji representation combinations that achieve optimal performance for sentiment analysis. Finally, we introduce emoji-based approaches for sentiment analysis in textual data."}, {"title": "2.1 Emoji Representation Collection", "content": "Emojis can be represented in various formats, including icons, textual titles, descriptions, and pixel-based images, where icons refer to the visual representation of emojis, textual titles provide their concise names, descriptions offer detailed semantic explanations, and pixel-based images capture their graphical structure. To effectively evaluate the performance of generative AI models in sentiment analysis using different emoji representations, it is essential to explore individual and combined representations. The initial step towards this goal involves constructing a comprehensive emoji representation dataset encompassing all available emojis across these multiple formats. Given that no single data source offers a complete set of emoji representations covering all four formats (icons, titles, descriptions, and pixels), we developed an open-source tool\u00b9 to address this gap. Specifically, we aggregated and combined data from Emojipedia\u00b2 and the Unicode Consortium\u00b3 to construct our emoji representation dataset for 5030 emojis, ensuring a comprehensive and structured resource for further analysis."}, {"title": "2.2 LLM-based Emoji Sentiment Estimation", "content": "With diverse emoji representations established, we employ generative AI to estimate the sentiment of emojis across various representation formats. This sentiment can subsequently be used to infer the sentiment of multilingual text containing standalone emojis. Given that LLMs, such as ChatGPT, are trained on extensive datasets that inherently capture emoji sentiment, we propose that LLMs can provide a more optimal approach for estimating emoji sentiment compared to traditional manual labeling methods.\nTo determine the most suitable emoji representation for sentiment inference, we used Emoji Sentiment Ranking v1.0 (ESR v1.0) [5], which offers a sentiment overview of 751 emojis based on category (positive, neutral, negative), as a benchmark for evaluation. The ESR v1.0 does not classify emoji as a single sentiment, instead, it calculates sentiment scores of each emoji category [5]. For example, an emoji can be predominantly positive but can also be used in neutral and negative contexts. Nonetheless, for our study, we evaluate the performance of each emoji against the predominant category of ESR v1.0. We first assessed the performance of individual emoji representations (icons, titles, descriptions, and pixels) and their various combinations, resulting in a total of $C_4^1 + C_4^2 + C_4^3 + C_4^4 = 15$ combinations. We employed ChatGPT-40 (GPT-40) to conduct sentiment analysis using the following prompt."}, {"title": "2.3 Standalone Emoji Sentiment Algorithms", "content": "Since emojis maintain the same visual representation across different languages, they can serve as universal sentiment indicators for multilingual sentiment analysis. When a text contains only a single"}, {"title": "2.4 Emoji Position-Aware Sentiment Algorithm", "content": "The proposed BSA, DPM, and majority voting algorithms described in Section 2.3 do not account for the positions of emojis when inferring sentiment. To address this limitation, we further fine-tuned our BSA algorithm to capture subtle variations in sentiment based on emoji placement and repetition. BSA was selected for fine-tuning because it outperformed both the DPM and majority voting methods (see Table 2). The fine-tuning process introduced a nuanced weighting mechanism that reflects how users naturally convey sentiments with emojis. Specifically, the algorithm can prioritize the first and last emojis to capture introductory and concluding tones while emphasizing repeated and consecutive emoji patterns to highlight strong and consistent sentiments.\nFollowing BSA, we set $w_{pos} = 1, w_{neu} = 0, w_{neg} = -1$ for positive, neutral, and negative weights and $0 = 0$. Sentiments are assigned based on the following criteria: (1) Prioritize the first emoji (First): $sentiment_f = w_{s_1}$. (2) Prioritize consecutive emojis (Consec.): suppose m unique emojis $[e_{c_1}, e_{c_2}, ..., e_{c_m}]$ are observed in $e = [e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]$ consecutively with consecutive length of $l = [l_1, l_2, ..., l_m]$, then $sentiment_c = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{s_{c_i}} l_i$, where $w_{s_{c_i}}$ represents the weight assigned to the sentiment of each unique emoji $e_{c_i}$. (3) Prioritize repeated emojis (Repeat): suppose m unique emojis $[e_{r_1}, e_{r_2}, ..., e_{r_m}]$ are observed in $e = [e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]$ with the repeated frequency of $f = [f_1, f_2, ..., f_m]$, then $sentiment_r = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{s_{r_i}} f_i$, where $w_{s_{r_i}}$ represents the weight assigned to the sentiment of each unique emoji $e_{r_i}$. (4) Prioritize the last emoji (Last): $sentiment_l = w_{s_n}$. Finally, (5) Aggregate all (All): $sentiment_{all} = sentiment_f + sentiment_c + sentiment_r + sentiment_l$."}, {"title": "3 Experiment Results", "content": "This section introduces the multilingual datasets used for emoji-based sentiment evaluation, outlines the sentiment ground truth establishment, and presents the results assessing emoji performance as a global sentiment marker."}, {"title": "3.1 Multilingual Dataset for Sentiment Analysis", "content": "To evaluate the performance of our methodologies of identifying text sentiment using standalone emojis in a multilingual context, we collected tweets from X (known as Twitter) related to the 2018 FIFA Soccer World Cup. Specifically, during the 2018 FIFA Soccer World Cup, we leveraged Twitter Streaming APIs to collect 32 sub-datasets from 32 participant countries and regions using geographic filters and World Cup-related keywords in their native languages. The entire sub-datasets cover 19 languages. For each participant country, we randomly selected 80,000 tweets, and the ground truth of sentiment was set up by GPT-40, as it provides more 94% accuracy on the long form of sentiment reviews [3]. The following prompt was used to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets."}, {"title": "3.2 Emoji Standalone Sentiment Analysis", "content": "We investigated the feasibility of using emojis as standalone universal sentiment indicators across languages, utilizing tweet datasets spanning 19 languages and 32 countries. Table 2 presents the average sentiment accuracy for tweets from 32 countries when analyzed using only emojis versus text with emojis. We evaluated the performance of three algorithms-BSA, DPM, and Majority Voting-on both the original tweet data and their English translations. The results demonstrated that BSA achieved the highest accuracy of 77.71%. Our experiments with translated text yielded results closely aligned with those of the initial experiment, reinforcing the robustness of the findings.\nWe further evaluated the performance of emoji position-aware sentiment analysis algorithms, including prioritizing the first, consecutive, repeated, and last emojis, as well as a method aggregating all these strategies, under the same settings as BSA, as shown in Table 3. Prioritizing the first emoji in the sequence increased BSA accuracy to 81.43%, indicating that the sentiment of the first emoji is closely aligned with the overall sentiment of the text."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "This study highlights the potential of emojis as universal sentiment indicators across languages and cultures, achieving an accuracy of 81.43% on a multilingual dataset spanning 32 countries and 19 languages. By leveraging diverse emoji representations-such as pixel, icon, and description-our findings underscore the expressive power of non-textual elements like emojis in sentiment analysis.\nNotably, prioritizing the sentiment of the first emoji in a sequence closely aligns with the overall sentiment of a tweet, and combining multiple representations significantly outperforms single modalities. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the number of emojis in a tweet and the accuracy of sentiment analysis for the algorithm that prioritizes the first emoji. These results emphasize the role of emojis in bridging linguistic and cultural gaps, offering valuable insights for future applications in cross-lingual natural language processing and social media analytics."}]}

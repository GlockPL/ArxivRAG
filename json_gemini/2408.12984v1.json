The synthesis of a specific zeolite typically necessitates the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), since the selectivity for a particular zeolite is largely determined by the affinity between the OSDA and the zeolite. Therefore, finding the best affinity OSDA-zeolite pair is the key to the synthesis of targeted zeolite. However, OSDA-zeolite pairs frequently exhibit complex geometric structures, i.e., a complex crystal structure formed by a large number of atoms. This geometric structure exhibits coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability: (1) Fine-grained local variability: From the perspective of fine-grained structure, each unit cell shares the same crystal lattice, but there are subtle structural differences, such as the different poses of OSDA in an OSDA-zeolite pair, as shown in figure 1(c).

Although some existing machine learning methods can represent the periodicity of crystals, they cannot accurately represent crystal structures with local variability. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Zeoformer, which can effectively represent coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. Zeoformer reconstructs the unit cell centered around each atom and encodes the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell. The introduction of pairwise distances within the reconstructed unit cell more effectively represents the overall structure of the unit cell and the differences between different unit cells, enabling the model to more accurately and efficiently predict the properties of OSDA-zeolite pairs and general crystal structures. Through comprehensive evaluation, our Zeoformer model demonstrates the best performance on OSDA-zeolite pair datasets and two types of crystal material datasets.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Zeolite (a type of porous crystal) materials have garnered widespread attention for their applications in gas adsorption [P\u00e9rez-Botella et al., 2022; Ackley et al., 2003], catalysis [Weitkamp, 2000; Chai et al., 2021], and drug delivery [Servatan et al., 2020; Serati-Nouri et al., 2020]. Zeolite structures are entirely composed of a periodic repeating structure of $TO_4$ tetrahedra (where T represents Si, Al, or P), which form three-dimensional (3D) networks by sharing vertex oxygen atoms O [Li and Yu, 2014]. The diversity in how these periodic tetrahedra connect results in a wide variety of zeolite structure types, theoretically allowing for millions of possible configurations [Schmidt et al., 2014]. However, designing synthetic routes for target zeolite topologies is a labor-intensive task. To date, the International Zeolite Association Structure Commission (IZA-SC) [Baerlocher and McCusker, 2021] has cataloged only 255 distinct zeolite structure types. In chemical reactions, zeolites typically crystallize under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of inorganic precursors and organic templates, forming as metastable phases that require organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) to compensate for energy loss and provide additional energy to stabilize these phases and enable diversification [Shin et al., 2019; Moliner et al., 2015; Dusselier and Davis, 2018].\nSpecifically, synthesizing a specific zeolite usually requires an OSDA, since the selectivity for a particular zeolite is largely determined by the affinity between the OSDA and the zeolite [Shin et al., 2019]. Therefore, finding the best affinity OSDA-zeolite pair is the key to the synthesis of targeted zeolite. An example in Figure 1 shows the combination of zeolite and OSDA forms the structure of the OSDA-zeolite pair. However, the OSDA-zeolite pair often has a complex geometric structure, i.e., a complex crystal structure formed by a large number of atoms. This geometric structure exhibits coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability: (1) Fine-grained local variability: From the perspective of fine-grained structure, each unit cell shares the same crystal lattice, but there are subtle structural differences, such as the different poses of OSDA in an OSDA-zeolite pair, as shown in 1(c). (2) Coarse-grained periodicity: Despite the subtle differences within the unit cell, the overall structure of an OSDA-zeolite pair can still be viewed as the periodic repetition of the unit cell in space from a coarse-grained structural perspective. Therefore, this kind of crystal structure cannot be accurately represented by simply repeating a unit cell according to lattice parameters. This complex geometric structure challenges most existing deep-learning methods.\nBased on the assumption that the relative coordinates of atoms between different unit cells in a crystal remain unchanged, many deep learning methods [Yan et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024] represent crystal structures by modeling the crystal graph of a single unit cell along with its periodic pattern. For example, Matformer [Yan et al., 2022] directly encodes periodic patterns by assigning six self-connected edges determined by a manually defined lattice matrix $L = [l_1, l_2, l_3] \\in R^{3 \\times 3}$ for each atom within the unit cell, as shown by the six solid blue lines in Figure 2(c). In Figure 2(a), the black arrows show the periodic encoding of an atom in a two-dimensional structure based on lattice parameters, which may point to non-existent atomic positions. Conformer [Yan et al., 2024] encodes periodicity by incorporating the spatial distances between different replicas of each atom along three directions as edge information, as shown in Figure 2(d). As shown by the black arrows in Figure 2(b), the periodic encoding based on this method reflects the differences for specific atoms. However, for unit cells with a large number of atoms, this method may not adequately capture the local differences between different unit cells. Although these periodic encoding methods achieve periodicity, they overlook fine-grained local variability. Specifically, in OSDA-zeolite structures, there are differences in the relative coordinates of atoms between different unit cells. Conformer and Matformer encode periodicity at the level of each individual atom, making them ineffective at capturing local variability caused by changes in atomic positions across different unit cells. More related methods and detailed discussions are presented in Appendix D.\nTo effectively capture the differences between different unit cells, we need to encode the coarse-grained periodic pattern from the perspective of the entire unit cell, rather than considering each atom individually. Therefore, we reconstruct the unit cell centered around each atom in the original unit cell and encode the pairwise distances between the central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell. This method encodes the spatial distances between a given atom and the nearest replicas of other atoms within the unit cell, rather than only considering the replicas of the atom itself. When overlapping the reconstructed unit cells for all atoms, the extent of the atom-reconstructed unit cells in two-dimensional space, as shown in Figure 2(e) (indicated by the green box), can extend up to four times the range of the original unit cell (indicated by the black box), and up to eight times in three-dimensional space, forming a supercell. This encoding method better identifies subtle differences between different unit cells, allowing the model to more accurately represent the geometric structure of OSDA-zeolite pairs, specifically the coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. The green box in Figure 2(a) provides a simplified illustration. For general crystal materials, this periodic encoding also offers significant advantages. For a detailed analysis, please refer to Appendix D. Finally, these encodings are integrated into the Transformer model, Zeoformer, achieving the best results in predicting OSDA-zeolite affinity and crystal material properties.\nThe main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct the prediction of the affinity between OSDAs and target zeolite topologies in the field of machine learning, which is crucial for guiding zeolite synthesis by screening OSDAs.\n\u2022 In order to well represent the geometric structure of OSDA-zeolite pairs, i.e., the coarse-grained crystal periodicity with fine-grained local variability, we propose a novel deep learning model, called Zeoformer, which introduces pairwise distance encoding in the reconstructed unit cell.\n\u2022 We conducted experiments on a zeolite-molecule pairing dataset (OSDB [Jensen et al., 2021]) and two commonly used materials benchmark datasets (Materials Project [Chen et al., 2019] and JARVIS [Choudhary et al., 2020]). The experiments validated the importance of our components and achieved better results."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "2.1 OSDA-guided Zeolite Synthesis\nSome studies [Moliner et al., 2008; Daeyaert et al., 2019] propose candidate OSDAs for specific zeolite structures using computational methods, including density functional theory and molecular dynamics. Schwalbe and Gomze [Schwalbe-Koda and G\u00f3mez-Bombarelli, 2021] address biases in simulation methods by comparing different approaches to calculate the interaction energy between zeolites and OSDAs, providing robust guidelines for computing binding energies in zeolite-OSDA pairs. Jensen et al. [Jensen et al., 2021] employ data-driven approaches to study the relationship between OSDAs, qualitative gel chemistry, and resulting zeolite structures. Machine learning has been applied in studies that do not explicitly model OSDA-zeolite interactions, including the investigation of specific zeolites within finite chemical spaces [Corma et al., 2006; Manuel Serra et al., 2007], OSDA-free zeolite systems [Muraoka et al., 2019], and zeolite phase transformations [Schwalbe-Koda et al., 2019]. However, existing research often simplifies OSDA representation to basic attributes such as molecular volume [Jensen et al., 2019] or is limited to single zeolite structures [Daeyaert et al., 2019]. In contrast, we adopt the concept of graph neural networks to model OSDA-zeolite pairs as graphs, aiming to predict their affinities for screening suitable OSDAs to guide zeolite synthesis.\n2.2 Crystal Property Prediction with Deep Learning\nCGCNN [Xie and Grossman, 2018] learns material properties from the connections between atoms in crystals. MegNet [Chen et al., 2019] is a graph network with global state attributes. GATGNN [Louis et al., 2020] uses multiple graph attention layers (GAT) to learn properties of local neighborhoods and global attention layers to weight global atomic features. ALIGNN [Choudhary and DeCost, 2021] and M3GNet [Chen and Ong, 2022] incorporate angle information into message passing to produce richer and more discriminative representations. CrysMMNet [Das et al., 2023] uses a multimodal framework that integrates graph and text representations to generate joint multimodal representations of crystalline materials. CrysDiff [Song et al., 2024] is a pretraining-finetuning framework based on diffusion models. However, these aforementioned methods struggle with accurately representing lattice parameters and crystal periodicity. Matformer [Yan et al., 2022] encodes periodic patterns through self-connecting edges of atoms. PotNet [Lin et al., 2023] considers the infinite summation of pairwise atomic interactions. Crystalformer [Taniai et al., 2024] considers infinitely connected attention, thereby performing infinite summations of interatomic potentials. ComFormer [Yan et al., 2024] represents the geometric information of crystals using equivariant vector representations and invariant geometric descriptors of Euclidean distances and angles."}, {"title": "3 Preliminaries", "content": "This section provides a brief introduction to crystal structures and OSDA-zeolite structures. For detailed information on OSDA-zeolite structures and the periodic invariance of crystals, please refer to Appendix C.\nThe Structure of Crystals. The crystal is a substance with a highly ordered structure. By selecting an appropriate structural unit, the entire crystal can be viewed as the periodic repetition of this unit in space. This property of atoms within a crystal repeating in 3D space according to a specific pattern is called periodicity, with the smallest repeatable structural unit being the unit cell of the crystal. The unit cell fills the crystal space when the structural unit is translated through lattice vectors. Thus, the unit cell can be defined as $U = (X,P)$, where X and P can be represented in matrix form. Typically, $X = [x_1, x_2 ... x_{n-1}, x_n] \\in R^{n \\times 1}$, where n represents the number of atoms and $x_i \\in R^1$ represents the atomic type of atom i in the unit cell. $P = [p_1, p_2 ... p_{n-1}, p_n] \\in R^{n \\times 3}$ is the atomic position matrix, where $p_i \\in R^3$ represents the Cartesian coordinates of the atom i in the unit cell in 3D space. To further encode the periodic pattern, additional lattice vectors $L = [l_1, l_2, l_3]^T \\in R^{3 \\times 3}$ are used to describe how the unit cell repeats itself in three directions. Therefore, in 3D space, we can represent the crystal as $(X, P, L)$.\nDefinition 1 (Unit Cell E(3) Invariance): A function $f : (X,P,L) \\rightarrow Y'$ is unit cell E(3) invariant if, for all $Q \\in R^{3 \\times 3}$, where $|Q| = 1$, and $b \\in R^3$, we have $f (X,P,L) = f (X, QP + b, QL)$.\nIn other words, the crystal structure remains unchanged when the position matrix P of the unit cell structure undergoes rotation, translation, or reflection.\nThe Structure of OSDA-zeolite. OSDA-zeolite is a variant of crystal structure. It still adheres to the geometric constraints of crystals, but there are local differences between different unit cells in the OSDA-zeolite structure. Therefore, we can still represent the OSDA-zeolite structure as a crystal graph, but this representation needs to reflect the differences between different unit cells."}, {"title": "4 The Proposed Zeoformer", "content": "In this section, we propose Zeoformer, with a key focus on encoding the coarse-grained Periodic Pattern Encoding of crystal structures, referred to as PPE, as illustrated by the Update PPE layer in Fig 5. We first demonstrate how to construct coarse-grained periodic patterns that reflect differences between different unit cells, and then explain how the crystal graphs are built upon periodic patterns to ensure the E(3) invariance of the crystal graphs. Finally, we present the overall framework of Zeoformer.\n4.1 Encoding of Coarse-grained Periodic Pattern\nPrevious methods [Yan et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2024] for constructing periodic patterns typically rely on the assumption that the relative coordinates of atoms between different unit cells in a crystal remain unchanged. However, in OSDA-zeolite structures, the atomic coordinates can vary between different unit cells. As a result, we cannot encode periodic structures independently for each atom, as was done in the past using lattice parameters. Instead, we need to encode periodicity from the perspective of the entire unit cell. This means that when constructing periodicity, the focus should be on the overall structure of all atoms within the unit cell, rather than treating each atom as an independent entity for encoding. We achieve this by reconstructing the unit cell centered around each atom and encoding the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell.\nFormally, given the position $p_i$ of the atom i and the modified positions of other atoms within the reconstructed unit cell $Pj = p_j + k_1l_1+k_2l_2+k_3l_3$, where $k_1,k_2, k_3$ belong to [-1,0,1]. These positions represent the nearest copies of the central atom i and the remaining atoms in its reconstructed unit cell, as shown in Figure 3. The following equation provides the periodic pattern encoding, denoted as PPE:\n$D_i = {\\sqrt{(p_i - p_j)^2} | i, j \\in Z,p_i, p_j \\in P,1 \\leq j \\leq n}$\n$\\qquad d_i = \\sqrt{(p_i - p_j)^2} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i - z_j)^2},$\n$\\qquad PPE = { U D_i | i \\in Z,1 \\leq i \\leq n, d_i > D_i \\neq 0 }$\nwhere $D_i$ represents the union of feature vectors of distances between the atom i and other atoms within the unit cell centered on the atom i, with $D_i \\in R^n$, and nrepresenting the number of atoms in the unit cell. $PPE \\in R^{n \\times n}$ represents the union of distance features between all atoms. Since the interaction energy between an atom and its neighboring atoms is usually inversely proportional to the distance, we take the reciprocal of the distance feature after removing zeros.\n4.2 Crystal Graph Construction\nWe represent our crystal graph based on the method of constructing multi-edge crystal graphs. In the graph, each node represents an atom i and all its infinite duplicates in 3D space, with positions ${P_iP_i = P_i + k_1l_1 + k_2l_2 + k_3l_3, k_1,k_2, k_3 \\in Z}$, and node features $x_i$. An edge is established from node j to node i when the Euclidean distance $|e_{j'i}$ between a duplicate of j and i satisfies $|e_{j'i}|^2 = |P_j + k'_1l_1 + k'_2l_2 + k'_3l_3 - p_i|^2 < r$, where r \u2208 R is the cutoff radius. We select the nearest t edges within the cutoff radius, each with a corresponding edge feature $e_{j'i}^2$. As shown in Figure 3(b), the blue circles represent the region defined by the cutoff radius. At the same time, the black boxes indicate the atoms included in our periodic pattern encoding. Formally, we represent the constructed crystal graph as $G = (X,X_I,E,PPE)$. Therein, $x_i \\in X$ is the feature vector of the atom i, $e^h_{ji} \\in E$ is the feature vector of the h-th edge between nodes i and j, and we denote $X_I$ as the indices of the nodes i and j that form the edge. $PPE \\in R^{n \\times n}$ is the periodic pattern encoding we introduced above, where n is the number of atoms in the constructed graph.\nProof of the E(3) Invariance of the Constructed Crystal Graphs. As shown in Figure 4, applying E(3) transformations alters the absolute positions of atoms within the unit cell but does not change the types of atoms, their relative positions within the crystal, or the lattice parameters; in other words, it changes the spatial distances between atoms, but the Euclidean distances remain invariant. When reconstructing the lattice parameters centered on each atom, the spatial distances between different replicas of that atom change, resulting in a change in the orientation of the reconstructed unit cell, while its size and shape remain unchanged. The atoms selected within this unit cell and their nearest replicas maintain their Euclidean distances relative to the central atom. Consequently, the constructed periodic pattern encoding remains invariant. Additionally, since we construct multi-edge crystal graphs solely based on the Euclidean distances between atoms in the crystal, the constructed crystal graphs remain invariant under E(3) transformations.\n4.3 The Architecture of Zeoformer\nIn this section, we introduce the information propagation scheme of Zeoformer. The information propagation scheme of Zeoformer consists of four parts: the graph embedding layer, node-wise transformer layer, PPE message passing layer, and output layer. Figure 5 illustrates the overall framework architecture of Zeoformer.\nFeature Embedding Layer. First, let's introduce the construction of the graph embedding layer. We use the atomic encoding from CGCNN for embedding. For the edge information $e^h_{ji}$, we use radial basis functions to encode the distance between two adjacent nodes in the graph, represented by Equation 1, where $\\gamma$ and $\\mu$ are hyperparameters. For the periodic pattern encoding, we perform matrix multiplication on PPE to carry out the initial aggregation of atomic information, obtaining information for the PPE message passing layer. Thus, we obtain the graph embedding as\n$A = CGCNN(X), e^h_{ji} = exp(- \\frac{\\|P_i - P_j\\|^2}{2 \\mu^2}),$\n$\\qquad PPE = PPE * A$\\nwhere $*$ denotes the Hadamard product.\nNode-wise Transformer Layer. Building upon the constructed graph, we aggregate the node information. Let $a^l_i$ represent the input feature vector of node i at layer l in Zeoformer. The information propagation scheme for layer l is described as follows. We use $\\bigoplus$ and $\\odot$ to denote concatenation and element-wise product. The message from node j to i is formed by the corresponding query $q^l_{ij}$, key $k^l_{ij}$, and value features $v^l_{ij}$ as follows :\n$q^l_{ij} = L_Q (a^l_i), k^l_{ij} = (L_K (a^l_i) \\bigoplus L_K (a^l_j) \\bigoplus L_E (e^h_{ji})),$\n$\\qquad v^l_{ij} = (L_V (a^l_i) + L_V (a^l_j) \\bigoplus L_E (e^h_{ji})),$\n$\\qquad v^l_{ij} = v \\odot sigmoid (LNorm (LN_{update} (v^l_{ij}))),$\n$\\qquad att^l_{ij} = L_{NK} (k^l_{ij}),$\n$\\qquad a^l_{ji} = q^l_{ij} + sigmoid (BN (att^l_{ij})) \\bigoplus L_{Nv} (v^l_{ij})$\nwhere $L_Q, L_K, L_V, and L_E$ are the linear transformations for query, key, value, and edge features. $L_{NK}, L_{Nv}$ are the nonlinear transformations for key and value, including two linear layers and an activation layer in between. $L_{E_{update}}$ represents the linear transformation for updating messages, and $LNorm$ denotes the layer normalization operation. $BN$ denotes the batch normalization layer, and $d_q$ is the dimension of $q^l_{ij}$.\nThen, we obtain the message $M_i$ by aggregating the information from the neighborhood of node i over multiple edges, and $A^{l+1}_i$ is realized as follows :\n$M^l_i = \\sum_{j \\in N_i} \\sum_{h} LN_{msg} (m^l_{hji}),$\n$\\qquad A^{l+1}_i = softplus (a^l_i + BN (M^l_i))$\\nwhere $LN_{msg}$ is the linear transformation used for updating the edge messages."}, {"title": "5 Experimental Studies", "content": "5.1 Experimental Setup\nWe conducted experiments on one OSDA-zeolite pair dataset (referred to as the OSDB [Schwalbe-Koda et al., 2021] dataset) and two material benchmark datasets, namely the Materials Project [Chen et al., 2019] and Jarvis [Choudhary et al., 2020]. Detailed descriptions of the three datasets can be found in the Appendix A. Baseline methods include CFID [Choudhary et al., 2018], CGCNN [Xie and Grossman, 2018], SchNet [Sch\u00fctt et al., 2017], MEGNET [Chen et al., 2019], GATGNN [Louis et al., 2020], ALIGNN [Choudhary and DeCost, 2021], M3GNet [Chen and Ong, 2022], Matformer [Yan et al., 2022], PotNet[Lin et al., 2023], CrysMMNet [Das et al., 2023], CrysDiff [Song et al., 2024], Crystalformer [Taniai et al., 2024], and ComFormer [Yan et al., 2024]. For all baseline methods on the material datasets, we report the results provided in the cited papers. Results for all baseline models on the OSDB dataset are based on experimental replications using their open-source code. Detailed Zeoformer configurations for different tasks are provided in the Appendix G.\n5.2 Experimental Results\nOSDB Dataset. The dataset can be accessed through [Schwalbe-Koda et al., 2021], comprising 112, 424 OSDA-zeolite pairs. We retrained all baseline models. To ensure a fair comparison, all baseline models were retrained under identical conditions, ensuring identical training, validation, and test sets, and reported the results for the prediction of four properties in Table 1. Please refer to Appendix I for the other four properties. Detailed configuration information for the retrained baseline models is provided in Appendix H. The metric used is the testing mean absolute error (MAE). Compared to previous studies, Zeoformer achieved the best results across all 8 prediction tasks, demonstrating significant improvements over other baseline models.\nJARVIS. The quantitative results for JARVIS [Choudhary et al., 2020] are shown in Table 2. Zeoformer achieves superior performance across all tasks. Notably, Zeoformer demonstrates over 25% improvement compared to the ComFormer variants in the Ehull task. Additionally, we present results for another 4 tasks in Appendix I, where Zeoformer also achieves better performance.\nThe Materials Project (MP). The experimental results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that Zeoformer outperforms other baseline models across tasks using 69, 239 training samples. Additionally, Zeoformer achieves competitive results in the bulk moduli and shear moduli tasks with only 4, 664 training samples.\nEfficiency. We compared ZeoFormer on the formation energy task in the JARVIS dataset against Matformer and variants of ComFormer. The results show that Zeoformer significantly outperforms in both training and inference speed while consuming fewer computational resources. For more details, please refer to Appendix I.\nOverall, Zeoformer not only achieves excellent results on the OSDA-zeolite dataset but also performs well on benchmark material datasets, demonstrating the model's outstanding generalization performance and robustness.\n5.3 Ablation Studies\nIn this section, we demonstrate the impact of periodic pattern encoding on the representation learning of OSDA-zeolite and crystal materials through ablation studies. Specifically, we conducted experiments on the OSDB and JARVIS datasets by comparing the results for Banding total and Ehull attributes, using testing MAE as the quantitative evaluation metric.\nBy comparing models with different layers of periodic pattern encoding against models without periodic pattern encoding but retaining the PPE message passing layer, we validate the importance of periodic pattern encoding. The results show that compared to networks without periodic pattern encoding, we achieved improvements of 28.2% and 17.5% in the Banding total and Ehull tasks, respectively. Compared to the models that retain only the PPE message passing layer but lack periodic pattern encoding, we achieved improvements of 18.9% and 7.2% in these two tasks, respectively."}, {"title": "6 Conclusions", "content": "In order to predict the OSDA-Zeolite Affinity, we proposed a novel model called Zeoformer. By reconstructing the unit cell centered on each atom and encoding the pairwise distances between this central atom and other atoms, Zeoformer better represents the geometric structure of OSDA-zeolite pairs, capturing both coarse-grained crystal periodicity and fine-grained local variability. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our Zeoformer significantly outperforms baseline methods in various property prediction tasks. Our model helps narrow down the search space for candidate OSDAs, demonstrating significant potential in the field of directed zeolite synthesis. Future work will explore more intrinsic structures of the OSDA-Zeolite pair and generate reasonable OSDA-Zeolite structures."}]}

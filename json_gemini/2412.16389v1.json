This paper examines both the capabilities and challenges of these models within creative workflows. While they deliver high performance in generating content with creativity, diversity, and technical precision, they also raise significant ethical concerns. Our study addresses two key research questions: (a) how these models perform in terms of creativity, diversity, accuracy, and computational efficiency, and (b) the ethical risks they present, particularly concerning bias, authenticity, and potential misuse. Through a structured series of experiments, we analyze their technical performance and assess the ethical implications of their outputs, revealing that although generative models enhance creative processes, they often reflect biases from their training data and carry ethical vulnerabilities that require careful oversight. This research proposes ethical guidelines to support responsible AI integration into industry practices, fostering a balance between innovation and ethical integrity.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Generative AI transformed the world of digital content creation, as it made computers generate text, images, audio, and even video that closely resemble human-made content. Applications range from automating writing tasks via tools like GPT and DALL-E to creating unique visual arts, up to realistic media, with major implications for industries like advertising, entertainment, and journalism. This also raises ethical questions concerning responsible use in the areas of authenticity, intellectual property, and biases [1]. This paper examines the dual aspects of generative AI in content creation: technical potential and ethical impact [4]. Its objectives include analyzing model performance, assessing ethical risks, and promoting responsible practices. Through technical and ethical experiments, we aim to highlight generative AI's capabilities and limitations, contributing to the dialogue on balancing innovation with ethical responsibility in AI-driven content creation."}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1. Generative AI Technical Landscape", "content": "Generative AI, using advanced neural networks, enables machines to create creative works across media. Transformer-based systems like GPT and DALL-E are now essential in AI-driven content creation [5]. GPT models generate realistic conversational text, while DALL-E creates diverse, complex images from text prompts. However, training these models requires vast data and computational resources, making them powerful yet costly. Their high resource demands also raise concerns about environmental sustainability and accessibility, potentially limiting smaller organizations' adoption."}, {"title": "2.2. Ethical Implications of Generative AI in Content Creation", "content": "Ethical concerns surrounding generative AI extend beyond the technical, touching on social and moral issues. One key concern is bias, as most generative models are trained on large datasets that may contain biased or prejudiced information [2]. This can lead to the spread of harmful stereotypes and perpetuate inequalities, as AI-generated output may reflect societal biases in the training data. Another concern is the authenticity and trustworthiness of AI-generated content [8]. AI can create artwork, music, and videos that can closely resemble human-made works, which then become very hard to distinguish. This is especially critical in journalism and digital media, where credibility is at stake. Also, there are ownership and copyright concerns because generative AI usually depends on pre-existing works."}, {"title": "2.3. Technical Capabilities versus Ethical Responsibility", "content": "Generative AI's capabilities increase the need to balance technical progress with ethical responsibility. Recent discussions suggest that artists and businesses using generative AI should incorporate ethical guidelines to ensure transparency and actively address AI-generated biases [7].

Implicit biases were identified in 30% of GPT-40 text outputs and 25% of DALL-E 3 images, primarily related to gender and cultural stereotypes. GPT-40 often reflected gender bias, particularly in prompts involving professions or domestic roles. Caregivers were more likely to be female, while authoritative roles tended to be male characters. DALL-E 3 sometimes generated stereotypical visuals, especially when the prompts involved ethnicity or cultural symbols, highlighting the importance of dataset selection and bias-reduction methods. Gender bias was also apparent, as the model occasionally depicted gendered roles in images that reinforced traditional stereotypes."}, {"title": "4.2.2. Authenticity and Trustworthiness", "content": "The strong authenticity of AI-generated content raises concerns about distinguishing the origin of the output. Human reviewers were unable to identify whether 40% of the sample text was AI or human-generated. Similar to GPT-3 [6], GPT-4o's style often made factual and informative text convincing enough to be mistaken for human authorship. Around 35% of images generated by DALL-E 3 closely resembled real photographs or traditional art. This highlights the need for watermarking or labeling AI-generated content to prevent miscommunication."}, {"title": "4.2.3. Potential to Cause Harm or Misuse", "content": "Both models were susceptible to ethical misuse if used to create misleading and harmful content. We observed that in 20% of factual prompts, GPT-4o generated text that was plausible but factually incorrect, posing significant risks of misinformation and potentially misleading readers.

These models are capable of creating content that mimics human creativity. 2) GPT-4o: A version of the GPT-4 model optimized for efficiency and lower computational cost. It is capable of generating high-quality text content for a variety of tasks and is the model behind ChatGPT, which is used in interactive AI applications. 3) DALL-E 3: A generative model by OpenAI capable of creating diverse and complex images from textual descriptions. It uses a transformer-based architecture similar to GPT models, but with a focus on visual content. 4) Neural Networks: A class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. Neural networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons), each performing a mathematical operation to process input data and pass it through the network. They are widely used in deep learning models for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and generative AI applications like GPT-40 and DALL-E. 5) Transformer-based Systems: Deep learning models that rely on the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the data simultaneously. This architecture is widely used in NLP tasks (e.g., GPT models) and has proven effective for both text and image generation tasks. 6) Cosine Similarity: A metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space by calculating the cosine of the angle between them. It is commonly used in text analysis and machine learning to"}, {"title": null, "content": "determine the similarity between documents or text sequences based on their vector representations. A value close to 1 indicates high similarity, while 0 indicates no similarity. The formula is: Cosine Similarity = $\\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| ||B||}$ where A and B are vectors, $A \\cdot B$ is the dot product, and $||A||$ and $||B||$ are the magnitudes of the vectors. 7) Perceptual Hashing: A technique used to create a compact digital fingerprint (hash) of an image or multimedia content. Unlike traditional cryptographic hashing, which changes significantly with even the smallest alteration in input data, perceptual hashing generates similar hashes for visually or structurally similar content. This makes it particularly useful for identifying duplicates, variations, or slight modifications in multimedia files."}, {"title": "Appendix B", "content": "Declaration of AI Tools Used In accordance with the University of Basel's guidelines on the use of AI in teaching and research, I hereby declare the following details regarding the use of AI-based tools in this work: 1) AI Models Used and Purposes: \u2022 GPT-40 (via ChatGPT) was used for generating textual content to be analyzed in the experiments. \u2022 DALL-E 3 (via ChatGPT) was used for generating visual content to be analyzed in the experiments. 2) Prompts Used for AI-Generated Content (directly shown in this paper): \u2022 Figure 3 (Comparison of AI-generated and human-created content): GPT-40: Write a short article about theaters with highlighting their cultural significance.\" DALL-E 3: \"Create a b+w image of a theater with a simple sky.

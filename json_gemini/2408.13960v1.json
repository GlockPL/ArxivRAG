Given the growing abundance of educational data, characterized by its sequential nature, time series analysis has emerged as a crucial tool in educational research [1], [2], [3], enabling more informed decision-making and personalized learning experiences. This approach, which examines time-ordered data points, is effective for analyzing a broad spectrum of data sources, from daily attendance records and test scores to more granular data such as clickstream logs from online learning platforms [4], [5]. These applications allow researchers and educators to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within educational datasets, providing critical perspectives on various aspects of education.\nTime series methods have become essential for extracting significant observations from inherently temporal educa- tional data, with diverse applications ranging from tracking student performance and engagement to analyzing institutional trends and predicting future outcomes [2], [6], [7], [8], [9]. For instance, by applying time series analysis to historical academic data, educators can anticipate student outcomes and intervene when necessary, thereby improving retention rates and academic success [6], [10]. Similarly, time series classification of student participation patterns on online learning platforms can help tailor educational content to better meet individual needs, fostering a more personalized learning experience [7], [11], [12]. Moreover, by detecting anomalies in time series data related to student behavior, such as sudden drops in grades or engagement, educators can identify at-risk students early, allowing for timely and targeted support [8], [13]."}, {"title": "3 EDUCATIONAL DATA AND ANALYTICS", "content": "Educational data is crucial for analyzing and improving the learning process. With the advent of advanced data collection technologies and the widespread adoption of digital learning environments, the volume and diversity of educational data have increased exponentially. These data span various educational settings, including traditional in-person classrooms, online learning platforms, and blended learning environments [90], [91]. Educational data analytics involves the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from these diverse educational contexts. It reveals critical information about student performance, learning behaviors, and overall educational outcomes. This section explores the domain of educational data, offering a structured overview that lays the foundation for applying time series analysis in this field. It is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sources and taxonomy of educational data, which is essential for the subsequent analysis and applications discussed in this paper."}, {"title": "3.1 Educational Data Sources", "content": "Educational data is gathered from a range of learning environments, each providing distinct perspectives on the educational process. Understanding these environments and the types of data they produce is significant for effective educational data analytics. In this subsection, we introduce three primary of learning environments. Besides, various educational data formats collected from these settings are discussed, including time series data and multimedia types (video/audio/text), based on their structural characteristics and unique features. This categorization forms the basis for analyzing temporal patterns in educational domains, which is one primary focus of this paper. Moreover, it presents opportunities for integrating multimodal data, such as combining time series data with video and text, indicating a promising direction for the future of multimodal educational data analytics [5], [92]."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Learning Environments", "content": "This part introduces three categories of learning environments for collecting educational data: in-person learning, online learning, and blended learning. Specifically, as illustrated in Table 2, each data source generated from these environments is comprehensively detailed, including data format, category, capture method (e.g., camera, microphone, logs, etc.), and so forth. Here the categories include five types according to the educational data classification framework [5], [71]: digital, physical, physiological, psychological, and environmental measurements.\nIn-Person Learning. It refers to the traditional classroom learning that occurs within a physical classroom setting where students and instructors interact face-to-face. This method of learning fosters immediate feedback, spontaneous discussions, and hands-on activities, which helps develop communication skills, collaboration, and a sense of community among students. Data collection in this environment includes attendance records, student attributes, behavioral observations, and physical interactions [90]. Additionally, more sophisticated methods such as classroom sensors and wearable devices can provide data on student engagement and interaction patterns. The data generated in in-person learning environments is often qualitative, consisting of teacher notes and observational records, as well as quantitative, including test scores and attendance figures [71].\nAs described in Table 2, the time series features of student physical and physiological data are a major focus in the study of in-person teaching and learning. Researchers have extensively examined variables such as heart rate, body temperature, and electrodermal activity to understand student physiological responses and stress levels during classes [92], [93], [94]. Additionally, in-class student behaviors, particularly movements and attention levels as monitored by various sensors, are widely analyzed to gauge engagement and participation [69]. Several studies have integrated time series data with video and text, examining elements such as student posture, writing activities, and facial expressions [118]. Others have employed a broad spectrum of data sources, including audio recordings, images, and video captured by cameras, to create a multi-faceted view of the learning environment [96], [97]. This allows for a richer and more detailed analysis of student engagement, attentiveness, and participation over time, helping to identify patterns and correlations that can inform teaching strategies. While the majority of research has concentrated on student-collected data, some studies have also considered data from instructors [100]. For instance, teacher presentations recorded via microphones, along with data from wearable devices by educators, are analyzed to gain insights into teaching practices and their effectiveness [94], [98]. The incorporation of time series data from instructors includes variables like speech patterns, movement around the classroom, gestural communication, and interaction frequencies with students.\nOnline Learning. Online learning, also known as e-learning or virtual learning, takes place through digital platforms where students and instructors interact remotely. Unlike traditional classroom settings, online education leverages digital technologies to facilitate teaching and learning processes, often through platforms that support video lectures, interactive modules, and various forms of communication [108], [110]. This mode of learning not only allows for asynchronous learning but also enables real-time interaction between instructors and students across different geographical locations. The diverse methodologies and data collection techniques employed in online learning environments bring to light essential aspects of student engagement, behavior, and performance, contributing to a more personalized and effective educational experience.\nIn online education, various time series features are employed to capture dynamic and evolving student interactions and physiological responses. A significant source of this data is the digital records from online course activities, which chronicle student engagement with course materials over time, providing a detailed log of participation [105]. Similarly, dynamic mouse records, captured through digital logs, track real-time mouse movements and clicks, revealing patterns of interaction and levels of user engagement [109]. In addition, evaluation records and digital logs of student scores offer a chronological account of assessments and academic achievements [102], [107]. Eye movement data, which tracks where and how long students focus on different parts of the screen, combines with electrocardiogram data collected by physiological sensors to provide indicators of stress and emotional responses during learning activities [95]. Environmental data, such as weather conditions, is also considered, as it can influence student mood and cognitive function, thereby affecting engagement with studies [103]. Beyond time series features, online learning environments incorporate various other data types. For example, the analysis of speech between students facilitates the understanding of peer interactions and collaborative learning, contributing to a comprehensive view of student thoughts and the overall educational experience.\nBlended Learning. This combines traditional face-to-face classroom methods with online educational practices, aiming to leverage the best of both worlds. This approach integrates the direct interaction and hands-on experiences of in-person learning with the flexibility and technological advantages of online education [114]. For example, a student might attend a lecture in person and then complete assignments online, allowing them to engage with the material at their own pace and revisit concepts as needed [116]. In a blended learning environment, students benefit from the immediate feedback and social interaction of a physical classroom, which fosters a sense of community and collaboration. This setting allows for real-time discussions, group work, and direct support from instructors, enhancing the overall learning experience.\nTime series data in blended learning encompass both physical and digital sources that provide insights into both teacher and student behaviors. These data are employed to analyze the dynamic interplay between in-person and online educational activities. Physical time series features include teacher body movement and joint positions [65], [108]. These measurements help optimize teaching methods by analyzing how instructors physically interact with students and the classroom environment. Additionally, facial emotion detection provides real-time insights into student emotional states, which can inform adjustments to teaching strategies to enhance engagement and learning outcomes [112]. On the digital side, time series features such as student online interactions, online teaching data, and offline teaching data are critical. These datasets, logged through various digital platforms, record how students engage with both online and offline components of the course [114]. By examining patterns in online activities, such as forum participation, assignment submissions, and content access, educators learn student engagement and learning behaviors. Besides, teacher speech and student evaluations further contribute to understanding the effectiveness of instructional methods and student feedback [108], [113], [117]. Recent studies incorporate data from digital tool adaptors and IoT adaptors, facilitating the integration of digital tools and IoT devices [111], [115]. For instance, data from IoT devices can provide real-time feedback on environmental conditions, such as classroom temperature and lighting, which can affect student comfort and concentration. While in-person learning predominantly focuses on physical and physiological data, and online learning emphasizes digital interaction data, blended learning integrates both. This hybrid approach allows for a more broad analysis of the educational experience, capturing the nuances of how students transition between and interact with both physical and virtual learning environments."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Publicly Available Datasets", "content": "This section provides an overview of widely accessible educational datasets used in the research, categorized by their sources.

This subsection introduces four main categories [54], [147]: academic performance data, learning behavioral data, socio-demographic data, and psychosocial data, summarized in Table 4. This taxonomy provides a structured framework that categorizes data based on characteristics and relevance to educational outcomes. Each category covers specific types of data, offering a comprehensive taxonomy used throughout the paper to align with various time series analysis applications.\nAcademic Performance Data. This refers to all metrics directly related to student achievement and outcomes [11], [14]. This includes grades from exams, quizzes, and assignments, test scores from standardized tests and subject-specific assessments, and assignment marks from homework, projects, and lab reports [15], [87], [148], [149]. Attendance records, which log student presence in classes, labs, and other educational activities, also fall under this category [16], [88], [150]. Academic performance data are crucial for predicting future student performance, identifying those who may be struggling, and tailoring educational interventions to support student success [151].\nLearning Behavioral Data. It captures the actions and interactions of students within various learning environments [18], [152], [153]. Engagement metrics, such as the time spent on learning platforms, frequency of logins, and participation in discussions, provide valuable insights into student engagement [11], [154], [155]. Interaction data from online learning platforms, including clickstream data and interactions with educational resources, as well as study patterns, such as logs of study sessions and resource usage patterns, are critical components of this category [17], [19], [20], [29], [156]. Additionally, collaboration data, which records group work, peer-to-peer interactions, and other collaborative activities, helps in understanding how students work together [82], [157]. Learning behavioral data are essential for analyzing student engagement, identifying effective learning strategies, and personalizing learning experiences to meet individual student needs [158], [159].\nSocio-Demographic Data. It relates to the background and demographic characteristics of students [160], [161]. This includes demographic information such as age, gender, ethnicity, and nationality, as well as socioeconomic status indicators like parental income, education level, and employment status [162], [163], [164]. Family background data, including family structure and parental involvement, and geographical data, such as location and school district information, are also part of this category [21], [22], [23], [24]. Socio-demographic data is used to analyze the impact of these factors on educational outcomes, develop targeted support programs, and address educational inequalities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the broader context in which students are learning.\nPsychosocial Data. This involves the psychological and social aspects that influence student behavior and performance. This includes mental health surveys that capture responses about stress, anxiety, depression, and overall mental well-being [25], [28]. Data on social interactions, such as peer relationships and student-teacher interactions, as well as emotional state tracking through applications that monitor emotional states, are also included [15], [26], [29]. Additionally, motivational metrics, such as self-reported data on motivation levels, goal-setting, and perseverance, provide insight into the internal factors driving student performance [27], [165]. Psychosocial data are crucial for identifying students in need of mental health support, understanding the impact of social factors on learning, and creating interventions to improve overall student well-being."}, {"title": "4 TIME SERIES ANALYSIS IN EDUCATION", "content": "Time series analysis is increasingly recognized for its capacity to transform educational research and practice by providing a deep look into temporal data patterns. In education, time series methods help in understanding and predicting trends, behaviors, and outcomes over time, thereby enabling educators, administrators, and policymakers to make data-driven decisions [166], [167], [168]. This section introduces and elaborates on four primary time series methods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection-highlighting their specific applications in educational contexts, as presented in Fig. 3. These methods not only enhance the analytical capabilities within educational data but also drive significant improvements in teaching, learning, and administration. By examining how these methods are utilized, we can discover valuable applications and guide future research in this evolving field."}, {"title": "4.1 Time Series Forecasting in Education", "content": "Time series forecasting in education predicts future trends and patterns in educational metrics based on historical data. Educational forecasting spans a range of applications, from predicting individual student performance to estimating institutional enrollment. Accurate forecasting supports students with personalized assistance and early interventions, while helping educators and administrators optimize resources and make informed decisions [169]. Given the distinctive predictive objectives, this section explores two primary aspects of forecasting in education: (i) forecasting grades and success, and (ii) forecasting enrollment."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Forecasting Grades and Success", "content": "Student performance prediction, especially in terms of grades and academic success, stands as a fundamental task within the educational context. By analyzing past performance data, such as test scores, behavioral patterns, and other relevant indicators, educators can gain valuable insights into student learning trajectories and potential academic outcomes [170]. Specifically, forecasting grades involves predicting individual academic performance by estimating future scores in specific subjects or courses, whereas forecasting success focuses on program-level achievement by categorizing students into broader performance levels [31], [171]. In this part, we examine the existing body of literature regarding the application, highlighting their significance in enhancing academic performance and supporting student success.\nForecasting grades typically involves predicting or estimating student grades at the course level based on features of academic performance data and learning behavioral data, such as attendance records, assignments, and test scores [30], [32]. Educators use this process to anticipate student upcoming performance in assessments or courses, aiming to predict the numerical or letter grades they are likely to achieve. Generally, predictive models for forecasting grades incorporate internal assessments, such as quiz scores, homework, midterms, and other internal evaluations, which serve as significant predictors of final grades [80]. For instance, researchers have developed predictive models by incorporating attendance records, homework grades, and quiz scores as key variables to forecast student final outcomes for a first-year engineering course at a university [172], [173], [174]. The continuous nature of these performance indicators makes them critical components in constructing accurate predictive models, providing ongoing feedback throughout the course duration [30], [175], [176]. Additionally, data from learning management systems, which record detailed student activity logs including login frequencies, assignment submissions, resource accesses, and interactions in discussion forums, are instrumental [177], [178]. These behavioral data points are robust indicators of student engagement and effort, which have been shown to correlate positively with academic performance.\nLike program-level prediction, forecasting success involves predicting broader academic outcomes such as overall GPA, graduation rates, and program completion [33], [34], [35]. It often revolves around classifying student performance into discrete categories such as pass-fail, below or above a certain threshold, or broader classifications like good, average, or poor performanc, and often relies on academic background features [31], [179]. Previous achievements, high school type, admission test scores, and the type of access (regular or special admission programs) are critical predictors of long-term academic success [21], [180]. In addition to traditional performance and attendance variables, socio-demographic and psychosocial data have been incorporated to enhance predictive models [68]. Specifically, socio-demographic factors such as age at admission, gender, socio-economic status, city of origin, and ethnicity are commonly used to establish a baseline understanding of student background [181], [182]. Psychological factors, including personality traits like openness and conscientiousness, alongside social networking data such as the number of Facebook friends and types of posts, provide deeper insights into student personality and social behavior, which can influence their academic journey [12], [183]. In some studies, linguistic features extracted from admission essays or other written materials, such as topic modeling, word count, and part-of-speech distribution, have also been utilized to predict student retention and success [184], [185]."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Forecasting Enrollment", "content": "Enrollment forecasting is the practice of predicting the number of students expected to enroll in particular courses, programs, or educational institutions in upcoming terms. This forecasting is vital for effective institutional planning and resource management, allowing educational institutions to optimize class sizes, allocate faculty appropriately, and efficiently use facilities [186]. Several factors significantly influence student enrollment patterns and, consequently, the accuracy of enrollment forecasts. To forecast enrollment accurately, institutions must draw on a diverse array of data sources, primarily including academic performance and socio-demographic data [187], [188]. This covers historical enrollment records and previous academic metrics such as high school grades and standardized test scores [189]. Additionally, demographic trends, such as population growth and migration patterns, significantly influence enrollment numbers [190], [191]. Socio-economic indicators like family income and parental education levels are also crucial [192]. For example, studies have shown that students with higher academic performance in high school are less likely to require remedial courses in college [193], [194]. Moreover, institutional factors such as the institution's reputation, the availability of desired programs, and the quality of facilities and faculty play a significant role [195], [196]. By integrating these diverse data points, predictive models can capture the complex factors that impact student enrollment, resulting in more precise and actionable forecasts.\nThe application of time series forecasting in enrollment prediction has become increasingly prominent, effectively enhancing the accuracy of predicting student enrollment trends through various methodologies [197]. Educational institutions utilize these models to forecast enrollment for each school and grade, aiding in resource planning and minimizing disruptions at the start of the school year [198], [199]. Traditional time series techniques like ARIMA and exponential smoothing have proven effective, with these works showcasing the ability of ARIMA model to capture trends and seasonal variations accurately [196], [200], [201]. The integration of machine learning algorithms, such as SVM and ANN, further refines predictive accuracy by modeling non-linear relationships in enrollment data [195], [202], [203]. In higher education, these predictive models are pivotal in identifying students at risk of dropping out, enabling early interventions and improving retention rates. Hybrid models, combining multiple forecasting techniques like ARIMA and neural networks, enhance prediction performance by leveraging both linear and non-linear data patterns [204]. Moreover, predictive analytics in forecasting admission test outcomes influence enrollment predictions, illustrating how these integrated forecasts enhance overall accuracy and strategic decision-making [196]. Overall, accurate enrollment forecasting plays a crucial role in student success and institutional efficiency, underscoring its broad impact on educational settings."}, {"title": "4.2 Time Series Classification in Education", "content": "Time series classification is an effective approach used to label sequences of data points over time, thereby identifying patterns that can inform predictions and decision-making processes. In the educational domain, time series classification involves analyzing longitudinal data to uncover trends, behaviors, and events that occur over time within educational contexts [205]. This technique is instrumental in understanding student learning and engagement by identifying and interpreting patterns and trends that emerge over time. This part explores the application of classifying learning patterns and student behavior, highlighting the techniques used and their practical implications."}, {"title": "4.2.1 Classifying Learning Patterns", "content": "Classifying learning patterns include analyzing sequences of educational data to identify different types of learning behaviors and trajectories. This can help in personalizing education, identifying students who may need additional support, and optimizing learning strategies. Educational data typically used in this application includes academic performance data, learning behavioral data, and psychosocial data [11], [206], [207]. Firstly, academic metrics like grades and test scores are crucial indicators of student learning patterns. Analyzing temporal data from academic records enables educators to identify trends and patterns in student performance over time. For example, it helps reveal whether a student is struggling with the material or facing external challenges that impact their learning progress [153], [208]. In addition, behavioral factors, such as the frequency and duration of logins, participation in online discussions, and completion rates of assignments and quizzes, indicate how students interact with educational materials [205]. By classifying these behavioral patterns, educators can identify students who are highly engaged and those who may be at risk of falling behind. A student who frequently logs in and participates actively in discussions is likely following a positive learning trajectory, whereas irregular login patterns and incomplete assignments might signal disengagement [209], [210]. Psychosocial data includes information related to students motivation, and attitudes towards learning. Survey responses about students stress levels or self-reported levels of motivation can be analyzed over time to identify patterns that may affect academic performance and engagement [36], [59].\nTo classify these learning patterns, various methods are employed. Supervised learning techniques such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), and SVM are commonly used [211], [212]. These methods rely on labeled training data to learn the mapping between input student features and output types of learning patterns. For instance, decision trees can help in breaking down complex time series data into simpler, interpretable rules that classify different learning patterns [213], [214]. Random forests, being an ensemble method, improve the robustness and accuracy of the classification by combining multiple decision trees [215], [216]. Deep learning methods, especially RNNs and LSTMs, are particularly effective to capture temporal dependencies and long-range patterns in sequential data. They learn the temporal dynamics of student behavior and performance over time, and are often used in adaptive learning systems to dynamically adjust the content and difficulty based on the classified learning patterns [38], [40], [42]. Existing works have demonstrated the efficacy of these methods in various educational contexts. For example, in MOOCs, studies have used SVMs and LSTMs to classify engagement patterns, predicting course completion and dropout rates, which allows for the development of interventions to increase student retention [12], [217]. In K-12 education, research has utilized decision trees and random forests to classify reading and math skills development patterns in elementary students, leading to more effective individualized education plans [37], [218]."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Classifying Student Behavior", "content": "Classifying student behavior entails examining various activities, including attendance, participation, and engagement with learning materials [157]. This process helps to understand and categorize students who exhibit behaviors that correlate with academic success or failure. The educational data typically used in this application includes learning behavioral data and socio-demographic data [219], [220]. In this task, learning behavioral data includes detailed logs of student activities such as attendance records, frequency of participation in class discussions, time spent on different learning activities, and patterns of accessing and using educational resources [18]. Analyzing these behaviors over time can help classify students into different behavioral categories, such as highly engaged, moderately engaged, and disengaged students [82], [221]. Besides, by incorporating the socio-demographic information about student backgrounds, such as age, socioeconomic status, and other demographic factors into classification models, educators can better understand how these factors influence student behavior and engagement patterns [158].\nApplications of classifying student behavior include the implementation of behavioral interventions, where schools can address negative behaviors identified through classification [29], [210]. For instance, a pattern of frequent absences can trigger an intervention to understand and address the underlying causes [222]. Engagement analysis is another application, allowing educators to identify when students are most and least engaged, and adjust teaching methods accordingly to maintain or increase engagement [159]. Additionally, classification algorithms can detect changes in behavior that may indicate mental health issues, prompting early support from counselors or psychologists. In higher education, the classification techniques have been used to identify students at risk of dropping out based on their engagement patterns with online learning platforms [223], [224]. In blended learning environments, research has shown that classifying patterns of interaction can help predict academic success and guide the development of more effective teaching strategies [83], [152], [225]. Techniques used for these classifications include supervised learning methods like decision trees and support vector machines, as well as deep learning methods, which are particularly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in educational time series data [39], [41], [226], [227], [228]. By classifying learning patterns and student behavior, educators can gain valuable insights into how students learn and behave, leading to more effective and personalized educational experiences."}, {"title": "4.3 Time Series Clustering in Education", "content": "Time series clustering in education is concerned with analyzing longitudinal data related to student performance, interactions and engagement to form meaningful groups. This process groups time-dependent data into clusters, where data points within each cluster are similar to each other and distinct from those in other clusters [229]. The primary aim of clustering in education is to enhance the learning experience by identifying trends and patterns that can inform teaching strategies and improve educational outcomes. By capturing the dynamic nature of student learning features over time, it provides a comprehensive view of the educational process and fosters collaboration by identifying opportunities to group students with complementary learning trajectories and behaviors."}, {"title": "4.3.1 Clustering Students", "content": "Clustering students aims to categorize students based on various profile information properties, facilitating tailored educational strategies to meet diverse learning needs. This typically uses a combination of academic performance data, such as grades, test scores, and assignment completion rates, and learning behavioral data, such as attendance, participation in class activities, and engagement with online learning platforms [66", "230": ".", "67": [231]}]}

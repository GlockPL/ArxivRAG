INTRODUCTION", "content": "In operational research and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, we are often faced with dealing with information expressed as preference orderings (PO), especially if human experts provide their opinions about the problem under concern only as preferences between several objects (or alternatives) and express qualitatively or quantitatively. The PO given by the source of information are not always total preference orderings (TPOs) (i.e., full or complete PO) but only defined partially, and we have to deal efficiently with this type of partial preference orderings (PPOs) to infer some important decision to make.\nThere exist several works on metrics and near metrics (i.e., similarity measures) between ranked data, and ranking aggregation is problematic, see [1]\u2013[4]. Most of these works are based on Spearman's footrule [5] and Kendall's correlation coefficient [6], [7], and they fail to take into account element relevance and positional information [8]. An appealing axiomatic approach to define the distance between TPO had been proposed in the sixties by Kemeny [7], [9] and is often used in applications. Recently, we have proved in [10] that Kemeny's distance is not the unique distance satisfying Kemeny's axioms, and the Frobenius distance can be used instead for measuring the distance between two TPOs. This paper extends our previous work and shows how it is possible to exploit this Frobenius distance to measure the distance between two PPOs without involving combinatorics.\nBefore presenting in detail the theoretical solutions we propose, we recall briefly the basics about the comparison of objects in Section II, Frobenius distance between total preference orderings in Section III, and belief functions in Section IV. Then, we present the brute force method (BFM) based on combinatorics in Section V with examples for calculating the distance between PPOs. To circumvent the complexity limitations of BFM in Section VI, we propose two methods of distance calculation based on belief functions, and we compare them with BFM in some examples. Section VII concludes this paper with some perspectives on MCDM and information fusion applications."}, {"title": "II. COMPARISON OF TWO OBJECTS", "content": "Let's consider two objects\u00b9 A and B, with their score denoted by c(A) and c(B) based on some chosen criteria of evaluation c(.).

For instance, if we consider a set of three objects $X = \\{x_1 = A, x_2 = B, x_3 = C\\}$, then we may have the preference Pref\u2081 given by the source 1, and the preference Pref2 by the source 2, with the following TPOs $Pref_1 \\equiv A \\succ B \\succ C$ and $Pref_2 \\equiv B \\succ C \\succ A$.\nIn this section, we explain how to measure the distance between two TPOs Pref\u2081 and Pref\u2081 in general case. For this, we use the Frobenius distance between two total orderings (i.e. preference orderings including eventual ties) proposed in [10] as a serious alternative to classical Kemeny's distance [9], and to Spearman's footrule distance (i.e. F-distance) [5]. The advantage of Frobenius distance is that it is a true metric, and it is quite simple to calculate. Contrary to the F-distance, the Frobenius distance satisfies the essential invariance under the indexing principle [10]. Moreover, the Frobenius distance also satisfies all of Kemeny's axioms. Hence, the well-known Kemeny's distance is not unique, and we have shown why Frobenius's distance is appealing with respect to Kemeny's distance through simple examples in [10].\n\nA. Definition\nFrobenius distance between two TPOs (i.e. orderings) of N objects is done by calculating at first the $N \\times N$ pairwise Preference-Score Matrix (PSM) based on the ordering given by each expert. By convention, the row index i of the PSM corresponds to the index of elements $x_i$ on the left side of preference ordering $x_i \\succ x_j$, and the column index j of the PSM corresponds to the index of the element $x_j$ on the right side of preference ordering $X_i \\succ X_j$. Hence we denote a pairwise Preference-Score Matrix $M(X) = [M(i, j)]$ where its components $M(i, j)$ for $i, j = 1, 2, . . ., N$ are defined as\n\\begin{equation}\nM(i, j) = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } X_i \\succ X_j, \\\\\n-1, & \\text{if } X_i \\prec X_j, \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } X_i = X_j.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\nNote that all components $M(i, i)$ (i = 1, 2, ..., N) of the main diagonal of the matrix M are always equal to zero. Also, PSM is always an anti-symmetrical matrix by construction because the preference $x_i \\succ x_j$ is equivalent to the preference $x_j \\prec x_i$. Hence if $x_i \\succ x_j$ is true which means $M(i, j) = 1$ then necessarily $x_j \\succ x_i$ is false which means that $x_j \\prec x_i$ is true and thus $M(j, i) = -1$, and the other way around. Consequently, $M(X)^T = -M(X)$, and $Tr(M(X)) = 0$.\nThe distance between two TPOs Pref1 and Pref2 is defined by the Frobenius distance as follows [10]:\n\\begin{equation}\nd_F(M_1, M_2) = ||M_1 - M_2||_F,\n\\tag{2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $||M||_F$ is the Frobenius norm of a square matrix $M = [M(i, j), i, j = 1,..., N]$ defined by [11], [12]\n\\begin{equation}\n||M||_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}|M(i, j)|^2} = \\sqrt{Tr(M^TM)},\n\\tag{3}\n\\end{equation}\nand where $M^T$ is the transpose of the matrix M, and Tr(.) is the trace operator for matrix.\nFrobenius distance is usually normalized in [0, 1] interval by dividing the value $d_F(M_1, M_2)$ by the maximal distance value $d_{max}$ calculated by considering two TPOs in full contradiction (i.e. a preference and its opposite defined by reversing the preference order). For instance, if a preference ordering is $Pref = A \\succ B \\succ C \\succ D$, its opposite is $Pref = A \\prec B \\prec C \\prec D = D \\succ C \\succ B \\succ A$."}, {"title": "IV. BELIEF FUNCTIONS", "content": "The belief functions (BF) were introduced by Shafer [13] for modeling epistemic uncertainty, reasoning about uncertainty, and combining distinct sources of evidence. The answer to the problem under concern is assumed to belong to a known finite discrete frame of discernment (FoD) $ \\Theta = \\{\\theta_1,...,\\theta_n\\}$ where all elements (i.e., members) of $ \\Theta$ are exhaustive and exclusive. The set of all subsets of $ \\Theta$ (including empty set \u00d8, and $ \\Theta$) is the power-set of $ \\Theta$ denoted by $2^ \\Theta$. The number of elements (i.e., the cardinality) of the power set is $2^|\\Theta|$. A (normalized) basic belief assignment (BBA) associated with a given source of evidence is a mapping $m^\\Theta(.): 2^\\Theta \\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that $m^\\Theta(0) = 0$ and $\\sum_{X \\in 2^\\Theta} m^\\Theta(X) = 1$. A BBA $m^\\Theta(.)$ characterizes a source of evidence related to a FoD $ \\Theta$. For notation shorthand, we can omit the superscript $ \\Theta$ in $m^\\Theta(.)$ notation if there is no ambiguity on the FoD we work with. The quantity m(X) is called the mass of belief of X. $X \\in 2^\\Theta$ is called a focal element (FE) of m(.) if m(X) > 0. The set of all focal elements of m(.) is denoted by $Fe(m) \\equiv \\{X \\in 2^\\Theta | m(X) > 0\\}$. The belief and the plausibility of X are respectively defined for any $X \\in 2^\\Theta$ by [13].\n\\begin{equation}\nBel(X) = \\sum_{Y \\in 2^\\Theta, Y \\subseteq X} m(Y),\n\\tag{7}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\nPl(X) = \\sum_{Y \\in 2^\\Theta, X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset} m(Y) = 1 - Bel(\\bar X),\n\\tag{8}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $ \\bar X \\triangleq  \\Theta \\backslash \\{X\\}$ is the complement of X in $ \\Theta$.\nOne has always $0 \\leq Bel(X) \\leq Pl(X) \\leq 1$, see [13]. For X = $ \\emptyset$, $Bel(\\emptyset) = Pl(\\emptyset) = 0$, and for X = $ \\Theta$ one has $Bel( \\Theta) = Pl( \\Theta) = 1$. Bel(X) and Pl(X) are often interpreted as the lower and upper bounds of unknown probability P(X) of X, that is Bel(X) < P(X) < Pl(X). To quantify the uncertainty (i.e. the imprecision) of P(X) \u2208 [Bel(X), Pl(X)], we use u(X) \u2208 [0, 1] defined by\n\\begin{equation}\nu(X) \\equiv Pl(X) - Bel(X).\n\\tag{9}\n\\end{equation}\nIf all focal elements of m(.) are singletons of $2^ \\Theta$ the BBA m(.) is a Bayesian BBA because $ \\forall X \\in 2^\\Theta$ one has Bel(X) = Pl(X) = P(X) and u(X) = 0. Hence, the belief and plausibility of X coincide with a probability measure P(X) defined on the FoD $ \\Theta$.

DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO PPOS BY BFM", "content": "In practice, the calculation of the distance between PPOs is of main importance because TPOs are not always available to calculate directly their proximity by the Frobenius distance presented in Section III. The main question is how to calculate the distance between two POs when at least one is partially known. From the theoretical standpoint, the combinatorial solution based on the brute force method (BFM) seems appealing because it will enumerate all compatible TPOs (i.e., CTPOs) with the given PPOs, and it computes the Frobenius distances between all CTPOs pairs and makes a decision from of all them based on different decisional attitudes. This section presents in detail the BFM.\n\nA. The brute force method (BFM)\nThe BFM consists of generating all the TPOs of the objects and then selecting all of them that are compatible with each PPO (called CTPOs) and calculating their corresponding Frobenius distances.

SOLUTION BY THE BELIEF FUNCTIONS APPROACH", "content": "In practice, the preference ordering of two objects, say X and Y, is not always easy to make, mainly because of the lack of pertinent/useful information to establish the scores or because of the very high complexity of calculating precisely the score values, or the difficulty to establish a personal judgment about the objects. In this situation, a choice between preferences $X \\succ Y$, $X \\prec Y$, and indifference X = Y is just impossible to make with certainty. In extreme cases, a preferential choice cannot be made at all because of the lack of evidence to support any preference. This corresponds to the full uncertain preference case denoted for short by X?Y or equivalently denoted by Y?X. The notation X?Y represents the total uncertainty about preferences $X \\succ Y$, $X \\prec Y$, and indifference X = Y, which corresponds actually to their disjunction. More precisely, one has\n\\begin{equation}\nX?Y = Y?X = (X \\succ Y) \\cup (X = Y) \\cup (X \\prec Y).\n\\tag{10}\n\\end{equation}\n\nA. BBA modeling from preference\nTo model the uncertainty about preference orderings, we adopt here the belief function formalism [13], and we introduce the simplest preferential frame of discernment $ \\Theta_{X,Y}$ between two objects X and Y defined by the three exclusive and exhaustive preferences states $ \\theta_1 \\triangleq (X \\succ Y)$, $ \\theta_2 \\triangleq (X = Y)$, and $ \\theta_3 \\equiv (X \\prec Y)$. Hence, we will work with the FoD\n\\begin{equation}\n \\Theta_{X,Y} \\triangleq \\{\\theta_1 \\triangleq X \\succ Y, \\theta_2 \\triangleq X = Y, \\theta_3 \\equiv X \\prec Y \\}.\n\\tag{11}\n\\end{equation}\nThe notation $ \\Theta_{X,Y}$ is necessary because we need to specify precisely the two elements X and Y involved in the analysis of the PPO under concern. We will eventually omit the X, Y index for whenever possible if there is no confusion on the elements X and Y we are working with (by default, we consider the elements or objects X and Y).\nTo address some problems where PPOs and uncertainty occur, we can consider that the preference orderings are not necessarily true or false (as in the classical preference model), but they can better be modeled by a basic belief function $m(.): 2^{\\Theta_{X,Y}} \\rightarrow [0,1]$ with m(\u00d8) = 0 and $\\sum_{z \\in 2^{\\Theta_{X,Y}}} m(Z) = 1$, where $2^{\\Theta_{X,Y}}$ is the power set (i.e. the set of all the subsets) of $ \\Theta_{X,Y}$ given by\n$2^{\\Theta_{X,Y}} =  \\{\\emptyset, \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_1 \\cup \\theta_2, \\theta_3, \\theta_1 \\cup \\theta_3, \\theta_2 \\cup \\theta_3, \\theta_1 \\cup \\theta_2 \\cup \\theta_3\\}$."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES", "content": "In this paper, we have shown how it is possible to measure the distance between two PPOs either by a brute force method or by methods using belief functions that can properly model the uncertainty inherent in PPOs. The brute force method becomes intractable in practical problems involving many objects in PPOs due to the combinatorial complexity, and this will limit its use in practice. The direct method based on belief functions is attractive because it requires only two sparse matrices of size 64N\u00b2, which are easy to construct, and it does not require combinatorics, which is a serious advantage over the brute force method for dealing with high-dimensional problems. Our new direct method can also deal with any kind of basic belief assignments (not necessarily with mass values set to 0 or 1 as used in this work) to represent possibly imprecise preferences, if one needs to deal with them. As research perspectives, it would be interesting to see if it is possible to extend this approach to calculate the distance between \u201chybrid\u201d partial preference orderings (HPPOs) involving disjunctions or conjunctions of PPOs, for instance between preferences expressed as $Pref_1 = (A > D) \\prec (C > B > E)$ and $Pref_2 = (A > B > E) \\wedge (D > C)$. This theoretical work provides a new tool for dealing with partial preference orders, which could hopefully help in the development of new fusion techniques for multi-criteria decision support."}]}

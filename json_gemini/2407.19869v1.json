The first approach corresponds to the brute force method based on combinatorics.

Unfortunately, this first method is not very efficient in solving high-dimensional problems because of its big combinatorial complexity. That is why we propose to circumvent this problem by using a second approach based on belief functions, which can adequately model the missing information of partial preference orderings. This second approach to the calculation of distance does not suffer from combinatorial complexity limitation.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In operational research and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, we are often faced with dealing with information expressed as preference orderings (PO), especially if human experts provide their opinions about the problem under concern only as preferences between several objects (or alternatives) and express qualitatively or quantitatively. The PO given by the source of information are not always total preference orderings (TPOs) (i.e., full or complete PO) but only defined partially, and we have to deal efficiently with this type of partial preference orderings (PPOs) to infer some important decision to make.\nThere exist several works on metrics and near metrics (i.e., similarity measures) between ranked data, and ranking aggregation is problematic, see [1]\u2013[4]. Most of these works are based on Spearman's footrule [5] and Kendall's correlation coefficient [6], [7], and they fail to take into account element relevance and positional information [8]. An appealing axiomatic approach to define the distance between TPO had been proposed in the sixties by Kemeny [7], [9] and is often used in applications. Recently, we have proved in [10] that Kemeny's distance is not the unique distance satisfying Kemeny's axioms, and the Frobenius distance can be used instead for measuring the distance between two TPOs. This paper extends our previous work and shows how it is possible to exploit this Frobenius distance to measure the distance between two PPOs without involving combinatorics.\nBefore presenting in detail the theoretical solutions we propose, we recall briefly the basics about the comparison of objects in Section II, Frobenius distance between total preference orderings in Section III, and belief functions in Section IV. Then, we present the brute force method (BFM) based on combinatorics in Section V with examples for calculating the distance between PPOs. To circumvent the complexity limitations of BFM in Section VI, we propose two methods of distance calculation based on belief functions, and we compare them with BFM in some examples.

Based on the score values and adopting the convention \"higher score is better\", in the classical preference model, we assume that we can always compare two objects and express the preference ordering between these two objects as follows:\n\u2022 A preferred to B for sure is denoted A > B where A > B \u21d4 c(A) > c(B), which is equivalent to B \u4eba A where B < A \u21d4 c(B) < c(\u0410).\n\u2022 B preferred to A for sure is denoted B > A where B > A \u21d4 c(B) > c(A), which is equivalent to A \u4eba B where A < B \u21d4 c(A) < c(B)."}, {"title": "III.

For instance, if we consider a set of three objects X = {x1 = A, x2 = B, x3 = C'}, then we may have the preference Pref\u2081 given by the source 1, and the preference Pref2 by the source 2, with the following TPOs Pref\u2081 \u2261 A > B > C and Pref2 \u2261 B > C > A.\nIn this section, we explain how to measure the distance between two TPOs Pref\u2081 and Pref\u2081 in general case. For this, we use the Frobenius distance between two total orderings (i.e. preference orderings including eventual ties) proposed in [10] as a serious alternative to classical Kemeny's distance [9], and to Spearman's footrule distance (i.e. F-distance) [5]. The advantage of Frobenius distance is that it is a true metric, and it is quite simple to calculate. Contrary to the F-distance, the Frobenius distance satisfies the essential invariance under the indexing principle [10]. Moreover, the Frobenius distance also satisfies all of Kemeny's axioms. Hence, the well-known Kemeny's distance is not unique, and we have shown why Frobenius's distance is appealing with respect to Kemeny's distance through simple examples in [10].", "sections": [{"title": "A. Definition", "content": "Frobenius distance between two TPOs (i.e. orderings) of N objects is done by calculating at first the N \u00d7 N pairwise Preference-Score Matrix (PSM) based on the ordering given by each expert.

Hence we denote a pairwise Preference-Score Matrix M(X) = [M(i, j)] where its components M(i, j) for i, j = 1, 2, . . ., N are defined as\n$M(i, j) = \\begin{cases} 1, & \\text{if } X_i \\succ X_j, \\\\ -1, & \\text{if } X_i \\prec X_j, \\\\ 0, & \\text{if } X_i = X_j. \\end{cases}$       (1)\nNote that all components M(i, i) (i = 1, 2, ..., N) of the main diagonal of the matrix M are always equal to zero. Also, PSM is always an anti-symmetrical matrix by construction because the preference xi \u27a4 xj is equivalent to the preference XjXi. Hence if xi > xj is true which means M(i,j) = 1 then necessarily xj > xi is false which means that xj < xi is true and thus M(j, i) = \u22121, and the other way around. Consequently, M(X)T = \u2212M(X), and Tr(M(X)) = 0.\nThe distance between two TPOs Pref1 and Pref2 is defined by the Frobenius distance as follows [10]:\n$d_F(M_1, M_2) = ||M_1 - M_2||_F,$       (2)\nwhere $||M||_F$ is the Frobenius norm of a square matrix M = [M(i, j), i, j = 1,..., N] defined by [11], [12]\n$||M||_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n |M(i, j)|^2} = \\sqrt{Tr(M^T M)},$       (3)\nand where $M^T$ is the transpose of the matrix M, and Tr(.) is the trace operator for matrix.\nFrobenius distance is usually normalized in [0, 1] interval by dividing the value dF(M1, M2) by the maximal distance value dmax calculated by considering two TPOs in full contradiction (i.e. a preference and its opposite defined by reversing the preference order).

In extreme cases, a preferential choice cannot be made at all because of the lack of evidence to support any preference. This corresponds to the full uncertain preference case denoted for short by X?Y or equivalently denoted by Y?X. The notation X?Y represents the total uncertainty about preferences X > Y, X < Y, and indifference X = Y, which corresponds actually to their disjunction.

Before calculating the distance between PPOs based on the belief functions, it is necessary to construct a BBA matrix associated with each (partial) preference ordering based on the BBA modeling from preferences presented just before. Two types of methods are analyzed in this work to establish the distance between two PPOs: the direct method based on the BBAs matrices, which requires calculating the Frobenius distance between two (8N \u00d7 8N) matrices, and two indirect methods based on distances between BBAs, which require the calculation of the Frobenius distance between two PSM-alike matrices of dimension N \u00d7 N only. We present briefly these different approaches next.\n1) Direct method: For each object Xi (i = 1, . . ., N) we first establish the BBA matrices BBA1 and BBA2 from preferences Pref\u2081 and Pref2 respectively based on the previous BBA modeling (see subsection VI-A, and the next examples). Because we work with FoD of cardinality three defined by (11), each BBA of the BBA matrix has 23 = 8 components. Hence, BBA1 and BBA2 matrices will be sparse matrices of dimension 8N \u00d7 8N. Once the BBA1 and BBA2 are built, we use the \"extended PSM\" matrices M\u2081 = BBA\u2081 and M2 = BBA2. Then, we apply the classical Frobenius distance definition dF(M1, M2) to calculate the distance between the two PPOs Pref1 and Pref2. It is worth mentioning that in order to deal with the mathematical representation of uncertainty by belief functions, we have changed the paradigm, and the \u201cPSM matrices\u201d are no longer N \u00d7 N matrices anymore (as defined classically) but extended into 8N \u00d7 8N BBA matrices whose components correspond to belief mass values defined with respect to different FoD defined in (11).\n2) Indirect methods: In order to work with belief functions and with PSM matrices of dimension N \u00d7 N instead of 8N \u00d7 8N, we examine the possibility to redefine each component M(i, j) of PSM-alike matrix from the distance of the BBA m\u04e9\u0445, \u0445 with respect to the BBA mx\u2081>x\u2081.

From the knowledge of Pref1, the BBA matrix BBA1 of the form (13) has the following components\nm1,1 = [00100000], m1,2 = [00000001], m1,3 = [00001000]\n= [00000001], m2,2 = [00100000], m2,3 = [00000001]\nm3,1 = [01000000], m3,2 = [00000001], m3,3 = [00100000]\nThe BBAs m1,2, m2,1, M2,3, and m3,2 correspond to the vacuous belief masses because we do not have information about the preference between B and A and between B and C based on the PPO Pref\u2081 = C > A.\nSimilarly, from the knowledge of Pref2, the BBA matrix BBA2 of the form (14) has the following components\nm1,1 = [00100000], m1,2 = [01000000], m1,3 = [00000001]\n= [00001000], m2,2 = [00100000], m2,3 = [00000001]\nm3,1 = [00000001], m3,2 = [00000001], m3,3 = [00100000]\nWith the direct method, we take M\u2081 = BBA1 and M2 = BBA2, and therefore the distance between Pref\u2081 \uc2a5 C > A and Pref2\u00ba A > B is dF(M1, M2) = 2.8284. Because the maximal Frobenius distance is dF(M1, M2) \u2248 3.4641, the normalized distance between Pref\u2081 and Pref2 is dF(M1, M2) = 2.8284/3.4641 = 0.8165. This distance is bigger than the average-based distance Aver (Pref1, Pref2) = 0.6966, and the mid-based distance @mid(Pref1, Pref2) = 0.5 obtained by the brute force method (see subsection V-B). This result reinforces the conclusion that Pref\u2081 \u2261 C > A is more dissimilar to Pref2 \u2261 A > B than similar to Pref2 because dF(M1, M2) is much greater than 0.5. The advantage of this direct belief-based approach is that its conclusion is coherent with the conclusion drawn from the average attitude obtained by the brute force approach without the need for high combinatorics. This direct method has a quadratic complexity of 64N2.\nWith the indirect method using Jousselme distance [17] we get\n$M_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0.8165 & 1 \\\\ 0.8165 & 1 & 0.8165 \\\\ 0 & 0.8165 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0.8165 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0.8165 \\\\ 0.8165 & 0.8165 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$       \nTherefore, the Frobenius distance defined by (2) is d\u00b3 (Pref1, Pref2) \u2248 1.1835. Because dmax \u2248 2.4495, we get finally the normalized distance between Pref\u2081 and Pref2\n$\\bar{d}^J(\\text{Pref}_1, \\text{Pref}_2) \\approx 1.1835 / 2.4495 = 0.4832.$\nThis distance value of 0.4832 is a little bit lower than @mid(Pref1, Pref2) = 0.5 obtained by the direct method above, and the brute force method based on mid attitude and on average attitude described in the subsection V-B. Hence, the conclusion drawn is now different from the conclusion drawn from the previous direct method because we will conclude that Pref\u2081 is a bit similar to Pref2 because d (Pref1, Pref2) is a bit lower than 0.5.\nWith the indirect method using belief-interval based distance [19] we get\n$M_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0.7071 & 1 \\\\ 0.7071 & 1 & 0.7071 \\\\ 0 & 0.7071 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0.7071 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0.7071 \\\\ 0.7071 & 0.7071 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$       \nTherefore, the Frobenius distance defined by (2) is\n$\\bar{d}^{BI}(\\text{Pref}_1, \\text{Pref}_2) \\approx 1.0824$"}]}, {"title": "VII.

{"title": "A Novel Idea Generation Tool using a Structured Conversational AI (CAI) System", "authors": ["B. Sankar", "Dibakar Sen"], "abstract": "This paper presents a novel conversational AI-enabled active ideation interface as a creative idea-generation tool to assist novice designers in mitigating the initial latency and ideation bottlenecks that are commonly observed. It is a dynamic, interactive, and contextually responsive approach, actively involving a large language model (LLM) from the domain of natural language processing (NLP) in artificial intelligence (AI) to produce multiple statements of potential ideas for different design problems. Integrating such Al models with ideation creates what we refer to as an Active Ideation scenario, which helps foster continuous dialogue-based interaction, context-sensitive conversation, and prolific idea generation. A pilot study was conducted with thirty novice designers to generate ideas for given problems using traditional methods and the new CAI-based interface. The key parameters of fluency, novelty, and variety were used to compare the outcomes qualitatively by a panel of experts. The findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed tool for generating prolific, diverse and novel ideas. The interface was enhanced by incorporating a prompt-engineered structured dialogue style for each ideation stage to make it uniform and more convenient for the designers. The resulting responses of such a structured CAI interface were found to be more succinct and aligned towards the subsequent design stage, namely conceptualization. The paper thus established the rich potential of using Generative AI (Gen-AI) for the early ill-structured phase of the creative product design process.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Creativity and innovation are quintessential during the conceptual design phase for solving problems effectively in an increasingly complex and technology-driven world. Generating many novel ideas quickly is not only valued but also expected from the designers ([1], [2]). However, this creative ideation process can often be challenging for product designers. Novice designers face this even more daunting, especially in the early idea generation phase ([3]). This is because the young designers lack experience and suffer from design fixation, mental block and/or cognitive fatigue during ideation ([4], [5]). We collectively refer to these cognitive barriers as Ideation bottlenecks that hinder their ability to generate novel ideas (Detailed in the following section 2. Background Work). Creativity in product design is recognized as generating novel and useful ideas, a concept embraced by design researchers ([6]). During ideation, designers are encouraged to engage in expansive thinking while also considering the practical utility of their ideas, which is crucial for addressing real-world challenges ([7], [8]). Creative thinking in this context is an interplay between divergent and convergent thinking, where each cycle of convergence can lead to the emergence of new ideas, supporting a step-by-step approach to problem-solving ([9]). Ideation is a critical phase in the early stages of product design, where the aim is to generate a diverse array of ideas, navigating through a dynamic \"design space\" that evolves from abstract concepts to tangible products ([3], [10]). It is the activity of generating, developing, and communicating abstract, ambiguous, and imprecise ideas. The activity typically starts with defining the product function and sub-functions, generating ideas for these components, and then integrating them to form a cohesive concept ([11])."}, {"title": "2. Background Work", "content": "In design research, the transition from written information to keyword-based online resource retrieval has become pivotal for contemporary designers. It underlines the importance of text in transforming thinking modes and facilitating systematic ideation through the development of a high-level design language ([12]). Keywords play a significant role in this process, guiding designers' self-dialogue and information search behaviours, which commonly involve word and image associations that contribute to generating creative design ideas ([11], [13]). Moreover, the text is a reflective tool that aids in forming ideas, with designers contemplating relevant words before searching, indicating that thoughtful consideration precedes information retrieval ([13], [14]). The ideation process benefits from external stimuli such as language terms, enhancing the creative potential of design solutions in terms of function, behaviour, and structure ([15], [16]). Ideation techniques are integral to the design process and provide designers with a pathway to foster creativity. Over time, product design has developed and employed a wide range of ideation techniques.\nEach of the ideation techniques listed in Table 1 offers a unique approach to stimulate creativity and waits for innovative ideas to spur into the designer's mind. Exploring these traditional ideation techniques reveals their foundational principles and inherently unveils common limitations prevalent in these techniques as follows. These methodologies furnish designers with procedural structures through defined rules, guidelines and/or procedures for generating ideas, albeit without direct involvement in the ideation process ([33]). While these techniques have been widely used, they often lack to provide active support for novice designers. The responsibility for originality and diversity in generating novel ideas essentially rests with the designer. Therefore, these techniques often fail to actively aid and engage novice designers who encounter hurdles during the early stages of idea generation. These methods lack the dynamism to support designers during their initial ideation. Even though they enable unconventional thinking and provide systematic procedures, all these methods possess limitations, encompassing potential judgment biases, constraints in visual representation, a requirement of a wide knowledge base and the prerequisite of expertise on the part of the designer. The ideation phase of the design process still poses challenges for inexperienced and sometimes even experienced designers. The quantification and formalization of generating ideas are active research areas, with many formal methods yet to be realized as computational algorithms. Existing tools focus on stimulating creativity and providing inspiration, leaving designers with limited options for creating quality ideas ([11]). The success of an idea often relies heavily on personal experience and innate ability. Although brainstorming and morphological analysis are widely used, they rely on individual bias and experience ([34])\u2014other ideation methodologies, including bio-inspired design and design-by-analogy, provide guidance and inspiration. Traditional ideation approaches are mostly based on design principles and design thinking methodologies, while program-based ideations automate and integrate the advantages of different ideation approaches. On the other hand, data-driven ideation relies exclusively xclusively on analysing existing data obtained from design experiments ([3]). Ideally, the ideation phase should result in diverse potential designs because multiple variations increase the likelihood of finding novel and innovative solutions ([35]). However, engineers often fixate on specific design options early, limiting the variety of designs. This phenomenon is called Design fixation, where designers adhere blindly to a limited group of ideas, negatively impacting creativity and reducing the diversity and quantity of generated design concepts ([15]). Knowledge and experience can contribute to design fixation, as our preconceived notions restrict the design thinking process. Novice designers may struggle to generate diverse concepts and often exhibit this phenomenon early in design. Experience and expertise play a significant role in creative idea generation, and designers progress through different levels of expertise, although this progression is not necessarily linear ([4]). Therefore, existing ideation techniques face challenges in providing concise methodologies applicable to designers of various experiences. Current Ideation methods, driven by knowledge and experience, hinder creativity and pose a challenge in guaranteeing novel ideas. Considering these constraints, a more proactive, engaging, and responsive tool is required to overcome the bottlenecks during ideation. Given these limitations, there is a need for an ideation tool that offers a more immersive, engaging, and stimulating role in idea generation rather than serving as a static framework. This gap in the traditional ideation framework marks the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with the ideation. Particularly, natural language processing (NLP), a subset of AI, has a set of algorithms called large language models (LLM) that have the ability to generate text based on input queries. An AI-driven tool, such as the proposed Conversational AI (CAI), could dynamically and contextually interact with designers, pushing them towards expanded realms of thought and igniting more inventive ideas. The purpose of this paper is not to undermine the value of traditional ideation techniques, as they remain pivotal in design. Instead, it is prudent to acknowledge the emergence and integration of AI models in ideation. It serves as a promising development for redesigning the creativity and innovation landscape in product design, particularly for designers at the inception of their careers. To provide such a solution, this study delves into the design, development and potential use case of a Conversational AI (CAI) system to facilitate abundant, novel and diverse idea generation for emerging designers. The proposed tool employs a state-of-the-art large language model called as the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), which was customized and used as an Active Ideation Chatbot to engage designers. It acts as an expert omniscient in ideation, enabling a naturalized human-like conversation. This gives the designers a fresh perspective and invokes new thoughts during the creative process. Therefore, it signifi-"}, {"title": "2.1. Identification of Ideation Bottlenecks", "content": "In pursuing innovation through the ideation phase of product design, several impediments can hinder designers' creativity and idea generation. We identify such impediments and categorize them into four primary types, which we term as Ideation bottlenecks as summarized in Figure 1. These bottlenecks collectively identified from literature can stifle a designer in creative idea generation. The subsequent explanations of identified bottlenecks are defined by the authors to create a shared understanding within the scope of this study.\nLack of Experience is a bottleneck where designers may struggle to generate valuable ideas due to insufficient exposure to varied design challenges or a limited knowledge base. This inexperience can lead to a paucity of ideas or the generation of ideas that lack depth and practical applicability, ultimately impacting the quality and novelty of the design solutions proposed. Design Fixation occurs when designers become anchored to their initial ideas. After conceiving a few preliminary concepts, there may be a reluctance or inability to diverge from these nascent solutions. This fixation not only restricts exploration but also inhibits the consideration of alternative and potentially superior ideas, thereby limiting the scope of the design and its potential for innovation. Cognitive Fatigue is a state where the mental exertion of continuous ideation leads to a depletion of cognitive resources. This fatigue can manifest as a reduced ability to generate a"}, {"title": "2.2 Classification of Ideation based on their characteristics", "content": "In the context of product design, the ideation phase is pivotal yet often encounters many cognitive and practical barriers ([36]). Regarding creativity and ideation, various definitions exist, as discussed in the introduction. Still, for the present context, we define a creative idea as \"an assertive statement that describes 'what' part of the solution and needs to be both novel and diverse\". Assessing the degree of novelty in an idea involves measuring how much it deviates from existing solutions and emphasizes the significance of originality, whereas the diversity of ideas refers to how far they are situated in the design space from one another. In this section, the authors identify certain characteristics prevalent among the traditional ideation techniques, characterized by a reliance on self-established thought patterns and conventional thought-provoking techniques. We introduce characteristics of a new ideation methodology that encourages dynamic engagement and the proactive pursuit of novel solutions using technology. Examining these characteristics offered a nuanced understanding of the ideation tools and helped formulate the proposed ideation method as a novel idea generation tool."}, {"title": "2.2.1. Solo Ideation", "content": "Novel ideas generated during ideation form the foundation for innovative and impactful products. However, many existing ideation techniques require the designers to work alone. This type of solo ideation is what we term Passive Ideation. Passive ideation is defined as one that enables only one-way communication, putting the burden on the designer's mind to generate ideas, thereby limiting the potential of designers. The following are some of the limitations of passive ideation methods. Lack of Engagement: Traditional ideation methods often lack the level of engagement necessary to inspire and ignite the creative process. While valuable, brainstorming or mind-mapping techniques can become monotonous. This passive approach may hinder designers from fully exploring unconventional or breakthrough ideas, restricting their creativity."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Collaborative Ideation", "content": "Collaborative ideation is characterised by a natural, dynamic, unbiased alliance between a designer and the ideation method, facilitating creativity and critical thinking. This continuous conversation-driven approach serves as a solution to address the limitations of passive ideation methods. This type of Ideation is what we refer to as Active Ideation. By embracing active ideation, designers can overcome the constraints of passive ideation techniques, encouraging diverse perspectives and interactive engagement throughout the ideation process. Enhanced Engagement: A higher level of engagement from the medium characterizes active ideation. Incorporating textual stimuli, dynamic prompts, and immersive experiences, designers are encouraged to think more creatively, break free from conventional thinking, and explore novel solutions to design challenges. Dynamic Idea Exploration: An active ideation medium encourages designers to think beyond traditional boundaries and experiment with various ideas through multiple quick revisions. By providing the ability to have natural conversational dialogues with an omniscient, designers can explore different solutions and generate multiple design options that would not have been possible. Data-driven Insights: Active ideation can collect and analyse conversational data during the ideation process, providing designers with valuable insights into the effectiveness and feasibility of different concepts. By leveraging real-time answers, designers can make informed decisions, prioritise ideas, and identify emerging patterns, leading to more diverse and detailed ideas."}, {"title": "3. Potential of Al for Ideation", "content": "Matching user requirements with novel solutions is a significant challenge due to the multidisciplinary knowledge required by the designer to create potential ideas. Generating many ideas and identifying the most valuable ones is beneficial to developing novel solutions in complex systems and competitive markets ([37]). The ideation process has traditionally been a human-centric task, relying on the cognitive abilities of the designer. This approach has significant challenges due to its dependence on designers' expertise and the above bottlenecks. With the use of computers in different phases of design, there has been a progressive shift towards integrating computer-aided tools into the creative ideation workflow as well."}, {"title": "3.1. Computer-Aided Ideation", "content": "Computer-aided ideation tools have existed for some time, offering a framework and environment where designers can explore, manipulate, and visualize ideas. These tools often incorporate databases of knowledge, templates for brainstorming, and mechanisms for capturing and categorizing ideas ([38]). Some of these tools, such as iDea of [39], Digital Brainstorming of [40]-[42], Idea-Inspire of [22], Bio-Inspire of [17], FuncSION of [43], Co-storm of [44], PANDA of [45], Web-enabled ideation of [46] etc., have provided significant assistance in the ideation process, helping designers to organize thoughts, inspire creativity, and document the process. They augment the designer's natural ideation capabilities by providing a digital space for exploration and documentation. However, the creative spark and the inception of novel ideas still originate from the human intellect, with the computer acting as a repository and mediator rather than a generator of ideas."}, {"title": "3.2. CAI for Collaboration with Computers", "content": "Let us imagine a situation where computers take a more active role in idea generation rather than being just a facilitator in the ideation process as in computer-aided ideation. The computer would generate ideas, suggest alternatives, and even challenge the designer's assumptions, and the designer would play the role of a curator of what the computer proposed. That is, the designer's expertise is utilized to evaluate the ideas and select the potential ones. This symbiotic relationship can be viewed as a Human-Computer Collaboration that capitalizes on the strengths of both computers and humans, combining raw computational power and intuitive judgment. Recently, large language models (LLMs) from the Gener-ative AI domain have gained prominence for their ability to generate diverse forms of original text ([47]). It is known that conversation AI (CAI) systems can be tailored to align with human values, as they are designed to emulate intelligent human agents ([47]). A salient feature of popular CAI systems is their focus on natural language interaction through chat-based dialogues, resembling human-to-human interactions ([47]). In addition, digital big data has opened up novel avenues for such CAI by harnessing the potential of large datasets as knowledge bases. The authors feel that this ability of modern CAI systems to meaningfully respond to vague and grammatically inaccurate queries while exploiting the big-data resource makes them akin to the behaviour of human experts and can, therefore, be exploited for creative problem-solving."}, {"title": "3.3. Computer-Generated Ideation", "content": "Ideation in design can be conceptualized as a cognitive exploration that seeks to bridge the gap between the problem and solution spaces. Traditionally, this process relies on the designer's ability to access and leverage their knowledge and experience. Only a fraction of the designer's knowledge, which is a small subset of the world's collective knowledge as shown in Figure 2, gets invoked at the crucial moment for idea generation. This inherent limitation can significantly constrain a designer's capacity to generate novel, high-quality ideas within a given time. Moreover, the spontaneous invocation of pertinent knowledge is not within the designer's volitional control, which can lead to cognitive stress and fatigue. This unpredictable nature of retrieval of a designer's own knowledge underscores the challenges faced in conventional ideation techniques. Therefore, we believe that timely access and harvesting of principles from a large repository of knowledge is critical for the formulation of creative solutions for difficult practical problems."}, {"title": "4. Ideation through CAI", "content": "There are two interesting features that make the CAI systems appear to be intelligent: (a) the ability to generate intellectually acceptable write-ups on a given topic and (b) the ability to generate responses to subsequent queries that build upon the previous interactions. This makes the interaction a coherent conversation on a given topic. Thus, if feature-(a) is a description of an idea, then feature-(b) could be constructed as an elaboration and clarification of that idea. In the following paragraphs, we elaborate on how these features of one such CAI system, GPT, can be customized and utilized for conversational design ideation. The concepts so developed are applicable to other CAI systems as well."}, {"title": "4.1.

As a natural language model, it has been trained to predict the next word in each piece of text, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant sentences ([48]). The GPT model by OpenAI has undergone a complex training regime that involves three core stages: unsupervised pre-training (USPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These stages collectively train GPT to produce human-like text while adhering to safety and ethical standards, balancing raw performance and controlled behaviour ([49]). Due to its vast size and extensive training, the model can answer questions, write essays, summarise texts, and even translate languages - essentially any task that involves predicting the next word in a sentence ([50])."}, {"title": "4.2. Characteristics of GPT as a potential tool in Ideation", "content": "GPT models are pre-trained on vast text corpora, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text responses based on input prompts. We feel that if the input prompt solicits a solution to the problem, GPT would generate a text that could be a practical idea to solve the problem. This characteristic makes GPT a potential asset during the conceptual phase of product design. By engaging in a dialogue with GPT, designers can articulate their design challenges, ask questions, and receive prompt and personalised responses similar to brainstorming with multiple people, but instead with an expert omniscient. Furthermore, its capacity to process and synthesize information from various domains can help cross-pollinate ideas, thereby fostering innovation. The iterative interaction with a GPT can help novice designers overcome ideation bottlenecks by presenting a flow of ideas that can be refined and expanded upon, ensuring a dynamic and fluid creative process. For instance, a GPT model might link a problem in ergonomic furniture design with insights from bio-mechanics and psychology, fields that may not typically be associated but can provide a deeper understanding of user interaction and comfort. By establishing such connections, designers are empowered to use knowledge more effectively, applying it in contextually appropriate ways to address the problem. The"}, {"title": "4.3. Potential benefits of using GPT for Ideation", "content": "The importance of making connections between knowledge in the design solution space cannot be overstated ([51]). Design is inherently an integrative process, requiring the synthesis of various types of knowledge to create solutions that are not only innovative but also practical and feasible ([52]). A GPT model can facilitate this synthesis by identifying patterns and relationships within the data they have learned that might not be immediately apparent to human designers. This ability to make unexpected connections can lead to breakthrough ideas and creative leaps in the design process. GPT models are adept at connecting disparate knowledge to specific problems, a key function during the ideation phase of product design. By drawing from a comprehensive database of information, GPT can bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete design challenges. When a designer inputs user needs or a design brief into a GPT-powered tool, the AI model can analyze the text, identify key themes and requirements, and then scan its vast repository of learned data to suggest relevant ideas, analogies, and concepts. This ability of GPT to understand and generate diverse linguistic structures allows it to serve as an ideation partner that can offer novel perspectives and solutions that might not be immediately obvious to human designers.

This process can also enable the model to learn the domain-specific language, creative design ideation, innovative problem-solving skills, and various design thinking strategies applied by expert designers.

This method of learning from an earlier conversation to keep the context of a current conversation is termed Contextual Understanding. The contextual buffer memory is designed to store the earlier conversations in a standard JSON file. In the case of an ideation session, if a designer prefers to carry out ideation in multiple sessions/sittings, the contextual buffer memory helps GPT to preserve the context of previous sessions and proceed from where it stopped.

Evaluating Effectiveness of CAI-based ideation", "content": "The potential of CAI-based ideation envisaged above needs to be empirically validated. Towards this end, the following two research questions are explored through practical design sessions in which graduate design students participated.

The GPT chatbot engages with the designer in a naturalized conversation using text or voice interaction modality to generate ideas as responses for the input problem statements.\nRQ1. Is there a benefit to using our Conversational AI-embedded ideation over conventional ideation techniques?\nDiverse conventional ideation methods are available to help designers provide relevant information and inspiration to generate ideas relevant to the problem at hand. However, due to their rule-ridden passive nature, these traditional methods impose the burden of generation on the designers. On the contrary, CAI-driven ideation takes an active role where the computer takes up the generation, and the designer's role is in evaluating and selecting potential ideas.\nMethodology for RQ1: We propose to use GPT to create a design chatbot adjacent to a moodboard forming an ideation interface using Unity and C# programming. Ideas for solving a given problem are sought from the designer, once through the conventional ideation techniques and once using the CAI-based ideation interface designed by us in a time-restricted format. At the end of the experiment, all the ideas are assessed for their novelty and fluency. We then check if there are any significant differences in these parameters in the two modalities of ideation.\nRQ2.

It can be observed in Figure 5(a) that 68% of the experts found the ideas produced by the GPT more meaningful.

Therefore, it supports the assertion that CAI can promote prolific ideation.\nThe novelty ratings of individual ideas were evaluated on a 1 to 5 Likert Scale by 80 experts using an online questionnaire. The findings are depicted in Figure 7. It can be noted that the average rating for Part A is 2.5, while Part B is 3.86.

Inferences and Discussion", "content": "Every idea can be associated with some cognitive resource (wisdom - experience, knowledge - expertise, information learning, data - observation, etc., as prescribed by the DIKW pyramid from information science) of the designer( [55]). Table 3 illustrates this association for some ideas from Table 2. This implicit connection between knowledge and idea demands that the designers can connect their cognitive resources to the problem at hand while proposing novel ideas. However, voluntary recalling of relevant knowledge is a complex yet unreliable cognitive process. On the other hand, a CAI system is inherently efficient in associating a query with the resources it has been trained with. Given its training using the vast knowledge base, GPT has quick access to in-depth knowledge than an individual designer in any particular domain of relevance. Thus, CAI-enabled ideas scored higher in novelty consideration.\nHuman designers often reach a saturation point where they cannot generate new ideas. This is referred to here as a mental block (one of the ideation bottlenecks). A broader knowledge base from multiple domains is important in helping the designers break free from these ideation bottlenecks ([56]). GPT is trained in knowledge across many domains; its inherent stochastic nature ensures that different solutions are generated when queried repeatedly. A designer's ability to acquire and access knowledge is limited to a select few areas of expertise. Therefore, GPT, unlike humans, does not exhibit saturation and generates more diverse ideas.\nThe linguistic analysis conducted on the ideas generated by designers and GPT, as shown in Figure 10, reveals that GPT, on average, has a higher count of linguistic elements such as words, nouns, verbs, and adjectives.

Structuring the Interaction Style with CAI", "content": "The pilot study has highlighted the capabilities of Conversational AI (CAI) in producing a rapid, detailed, novel and diverse collection of ideas. However, the efficacy of CAI is intricately linked to the specificity of the queries posed to it. Thus, to enhance the effectiveness of the CAI, there is a need for a consistent, structured format for the queries (prompts) given as input to the CAI. This structure should encapsulate the essential requirements of design, making it uniformly effective for any designer using our CAI system. On the other hand, it also presents a challenge, as the depth and volume of details generated by CAI can lead to cognitive overload during the selection phase, where designers must sift through extensive information to identify and select potential solutions. This poses a daunting task, given the huge number of ideas generated by the CAI. Thus, there is a need for a consistent, structured format for the responses generated as output by the CAI similar to that of the prompts. This ensures quick information retrieval and fast interpretation by the designers, reducing uncertainty in navigating the generated content.

Structuring the Problem Statement", "content": "Defining and understanding a problem's nature is important for producing novel solutions in product design ([58]). The use of Solution Neutral Problem Statement (SNPS) is a standard practice for this purpose. However, designers often find it difficult to state the problem in this format. Hence, we are proposing a structure that will be used by the CAI to systematically formulate the problem statement by pinpointing the challenges that make the problem difficult, given the user needs as input by the designer. Ideation involves propositions by which these challenges could be overcome. The proposed structure for a problem statement is encapsulated in the \"AI3C: Activity-Item-Contradiction-Constraint-Criteria\" model. The proposed problem structure is based on the interaction of two critical elements:\n1.  Element A (Activity): This represents the action or series of actions applied within the problem space.\n2.  Element B (Item): This is the target or subject upon which the activity is performed, leading to a desired state change.\nUnder ideal conditions, where knowledge and resources are available, the interaction between Element A and Element B should not pose any challenge, and state change should be readily achievable. However, in practical scenarios, the interplay of the Contradiction, Constraint, and Criteria complicates this interaction, giving rise to a problem, thereby making the core issue explicit.\nContradiction arises when there is a direct conflict between the desired state change and the actual relationship between Element A and Element B.\nConstraints are the bounding conditions within which the problem must be solved. These may include technical constraints, such as the maximum weight a material can support; economic constraints, such as budget limits; or regulatory constraints, such as safety and environmental regulations.\nCriteria represent the benchmarks for evaluating the success of a solution. They are the qualitative and quantitative goals the design must achieve to succeed. These could include performance criteria like speed or efficiency, usability criteria such as user-friendliness, or environmental impact criteria such as carbon footprint."}, {"title": "7.2. Structuring the Input Prompt Style for Idea Generation", "content": "The response generated by CAI engines depends upon the exact phrase used as input for a given query. Therefore, it is important to formulate the right style for the phrases to invoke more useful responses in the design context. Ideation is a common cognitive activity during the conceptual design phase, which generates propositions by which challenges could be overcome for the problem. The cognitive process of problem-solving involves the stages of searching, learning, synthesis, analysis, and inference ([59]\u2013[61]). During recursive ideation, the corresponding stages are referred to as exploration (searching), inspiration (learning), generation (synthesis), elaboration (analysis), and evaluation (inference). We map the different types of prompts available in the domain of prompt engineering ([62], [63]) in CAI to be given as input that facilitates each of these ideation stages. A prompt is an assertive sentence used to solicit a response from CAI. Each type of prompt is characterized by a context and a query. A context is defined by the nature of the fields contained in it. The essential fields for each context and the corresponding structure of the prompt are presented in Table 4 with illustrative examples for each stage of ideation.\nThe key to harnessing the ideation potential of CAI lies in the structured formulation of input prompts and output responses. By carefully crafting prompts, designers can guide CAI in generating structured responses pertinent to the problem. In this way, LLMs are not bottlenecked by the designer's limited knowledge or the stochastic nature of human cognitive recall. Providing a structure for inputs guides the CAI in understanding the context and constraints of the problem space, ensuring that the generated ideas are relevant and focused. Without such a structure, the CAI produces responses that, while potentially creative and diverse, lack specificity to the task at hand and overwhelm the user with an excess of detailed procedural content, as seen from the results of the pilot study (Table 2). Structured prompts help steer the AI towards the generation of 'what to do' ideas rather than 'how to do it' processes, thus aiding in the conceptual phase of solution development."}, {"title": "7.2.1.

We explore the transformative effects of GenAI on the architectural design process and\ndiscuss the role of the architect. The case of architecture is interesting as designing houses is complex\ninvolving also extensive customer interaction. We employ a within subject experiment using a popular\ngeneral- purpose text-to-image tool for generating designs and providing feedback on existing designs\nfollowed by expert interviews. The study reveals that AI can disrupt the ideation phase by enabling\nclients to get engaged in the design process through rapid visualization of their own ideas. In turn, so\nour thesis, the architect's role shifts more towards assessing feasibility of design generated conjoint by\nclients and AI. Our study also shows that while AI can provide valuable feedback on designs, it might\nfail to generate such designs allowing for interesting connections to foundations in computer science,\ni.e., NP-completeness. Al's feedback also tends to hamper creativity and innovation by suggesting\naltering novel, innovative approaches towards more standardized designs. Our study also reveals that\nthere is uncertainty among architects about the interpretative sovereignty of architecture (and loss of\nmeaning and identity) when AI increasingly takes over authorship in the design process.\nKeywords: Generative AI, Architectural Design, Human Creativity, Technology Adoption", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Many fields associated with creativity such as architecture are undergoing a profound transformation,\ndriven by the rise of Generative AI(GenAI), which has introduced unprecedented potential for\ninnovation and efficieney-new methods in creative design processes (Schwartz et al., 2021), while at the\nsame time also posing a threat of machines monopolizing creativity (David De Cremer & Falk, 2023).\nSpecifically, text-to-image models, such as Dall-E, have emerged as valuable tools, enabling creative\nprofessions such as architects and visual artists, but also laymen, to envision, iterate, and communicate\ndesigns in ways previously constrained by traditional methodologies requiring extensive expertise (Ko\net al., 2023). These models challenge the boundaries of traditional architectural practice by transforming,\nat best, enhancing the ideation phase and extending the architect's \u201ccognitive workbench\" beyond\nconventional approaches (Hanafy, 2023; Oppenlaender, 2022) though also being met with aversion (X.\nZhang & Zhu, 2024).\nWhile prior work has focused primarily on the supporting role of GenAI for experts in ideation, e.g.,\nPaananen et al. (2023), or comparing different tools for ideation subtasks, e.g., C. Zhang et al. (2023),\nwe consider the architectural design process more holistically, covering also the clients and using AI\nnot only for the most creative part - ideation - but also for feedback, which has received relatively little\nattention, e.g., Cvetkovic et al. (2023). This naturally also raises new questions regarding the architect's\nrole and authorship due to the implementation of AI in architecture. Thus, our research questions are:\nRQ 1) How can (and cannot) GenAI support the design process including client engagement?\nRQ 2) How is the role of architects and its clients changing?\nIn this work we provide first (partial) answers based on an experiment followed by interviews involving\nfive architects. The study reveals that GenAI empowers customers and architects alike to create fast"}, {"title": "Background", "content": "Long before GenAI creativity has been studied within information systems, e.g., Seidel et al. (2010) and\nSimonovi\u010d et al. (2024) and other fields such as computational creativity, e.g., Basalla et al. (2022). The\ntransformative nature of GenAI meaning the rise of large multi-modal foundation models (Schneider et\nal., 2024) showing remarkable creative capabilities has dramatically accelerated the discussion on\nGenAl's impact on work. GenAI has been shown to successfully augment creative work (Jia et al.,\n2024). In the realm of urban planning, the benefits of GenAI have been shown for designing blue prints\n(defining the shape of houses seen from above) (Weber et al., 2024). The investigated AI system did not\nallow for customization, i.e., prompting, but rather it just generated proposals. Our findings are\ncomplementary to Weber's as there is little overlap, which is not surprising as we focus on a different\ntask (designing a building including details rather than just the outline) and used advanced text-to-image\nmodels which are anticipated to alter the architectural visual culture (Steinfeld, 2023; Baudoux, 2024).\nThese models support the creative thinking process (Jaruga-Rozdolska, 2022) but are also viewed\ncritically. Ploennigs & Berger (2023) argue that the generation of images can be very time consuming,\nas the desired results can only be achieved through prompt engineering driven by trial and error. Chen\net al. (2023) add that text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and Dall-E are yet\nunable to incorporate specific styles in design and shapes in the generated images though they can help,\ni.e., to turn design sketches into 3d designs (C. Zhang et al., 2023). Paananen et al. (2023) conducted a\nlaboratory study involving students only and various text-to-image tools showing that GenAI can be a\nhelpful tool for architects for ideation, but also highlighted limitations such as the inability to generate\nfloorplans. Our findings confirm technical shortcomings through statements from professionals. Our\nfocus is on professionals and the entire design process covering additional use-cases of GenAI such as\nfeedback and stakeholders revealing further shortcomings more relevant in practice.\nDesign Process: Design is an intricate, iterative process with focus on problem-solving activities\nencompassing diverse cognitive skills, such as the intangible elements of intuition, imagination, and\ncreativity (Cho, 2017; Zeisel, 2006). Within the design process, a set of configurations are proposed and\nreviewed to achieve intended design purposes. However, design is intended to transcend mere\nappropriateness and functionality, encompassing the inception and materialization of novel ideas,\neffectively balancing intellectual pursuits with technical considerations (Eissa, 2019). Architectural\ndesign can be approached as a problem-solving practice for which architects design human-centric and\nfunctional spaces and environments to accommodate diverse human activities (Hettithanthri et al.,\n2023). By necessitating that architectural creations simultaneously possess a blend of aesthetic appeal,\nstructural integrity, and practical functionality, the discipline of architecture sets itself apart from other\n(purely) artistic disciplines (Castro Pena et al., 2021). Architects are required to possess crucial cognitive\nskills including creativity and spatial awareness (Cho, 2017)."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In our experimental evaluation we ask experts to use a text-to-image model followed by semi-structured\ninterviews. The experimental evaluation ensured that all participants got hands-on exposure to GenAI,\nin particular the evaluated tool Dall-E 3.

It can be considered as an easy to access state-of-the-art tool for image generation"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "We first discuss RQ 1 discussing the impact on ideation and design visualization as well as client\ninteraction. Figure 1 summarizes key findings visually focusing on a design process driven conjointly\nby clients and GenAI. However, we also discuss the value of GenAI for architects.\nIdeation by architects: All interview participants indicated that AI can serve as a source of inspiration\nand provide reference models during the ideation phase.

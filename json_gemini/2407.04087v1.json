A comparative analysis of the modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method (previously developed) with recent breakthroughs in nature-inspired algorithms demonstrates the modified ACO's superiority over modern techniques. By utilizing the modified ACO algorithm, the most efficient routes connecting the origin and destination of the metro route are generated. Additionally, the model is applied to the existing metro network to highlight variations between the model's results and the current network. The Google Maps platform, integrated with Python, handles real-time data, including land utilization, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, census information, and points of interest. This processing enables the identification of stops within the city and along the chosen routes. The resulting metro network showcases substantial benefits compared to conventional route planning methods, with noteworthy enhancements in workforce productivity, decreased planning time, and cost-efficiency. This study significantly enhances the efficiency of urban transport systems, specifically in rapidly changing metropolitan settings such as Chennai.", "sections": [{"title": "I.

LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology is done to select the important research and review articles based on the scope of the work using pre-defined criteria. It is for faster and in-depth analysis of articles as per the need. A total of 67 articles is reviewed as part of the research and considered 32 articles specifically for the review using the PRISMA. Fig. 1 is a flowchart to depict the entire process of the review.\nEcological and evolutionary studies employ SDMs extensively. Most SDM methods involve considerable GIS data preparation before model creation. This stage is often difficult and might lead to poorly parameterized models or SDM implementation issues. SDM development is not the last outcome for many investigations, and processing after modelling might be difficult. SDMtoolbox streamlines complex species distribution modelling and geospatial analytic pre- and post-processing steps. A single interface houses 59 Python-based GIS utilities in the SDMtoolbox. Several tools improved Maxent SDM prediction performance. SDMtoolbox evaluates haplotype network landscape connectivity using paths or least-cost corridors. It also corrects SDM data overpredictions, quantifies distribution changes between present and future SDMs, and computes biodiversity indicators. SDMtoolbox, for ArcGIS 10.1 or above, focuses on macroecology, landscape genetics, and evolution. Spatial Analyst extension-compatible. The toolbox eliminates post-SDM analysis, redundant & time-consuming climate data pre-processing, and simplifying species distribution modelling and other GIS analysis chores [1].\nParticle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used to suggest a new urban park spatial location allocation (SLA) method. PSO uses swarm intelligence for efficient optimisation. Population-based random search algorithms based on bird flock social behaviour is used in the study. PSO is simpler, easier to build, and requires less parameters than other AI methods. It considers population density, accessibility, and competitiveness while configuring urban parks. SLA computation using the standard overlaying method is challenging to determine park areas that match these characteristics. Reduce computational complexity and effectively identify parks with Particle Swarm Optimisa-tion (PSO). The service area in urban park simulation findings proved public green-space service fairness. For Service Level Agreement (SLA) issues, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) was found to be practical and effective. The technique can be used in water-saving irrigation systems, farm service centres, hospitals, supermarkets, and cinemas [2].\nMSW is an increasing problem in towns globally since it contributes to global warming and climate change. Municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and disposal, in developing nations, are essential for environmental and landscape sustainability. These factors greatly affect life quality and expectancy. The inquiry focuses on MSW collection in Danang, one of Vietnam's four major cities. Danang city has a high garbage burden per capita and is affected by climate change, especially extreme weather and natural disasters. A new truck routing model for MSW collection in Danang is proposed. This study uses Chaotic PSO and ArcGIS to optimise Danang's vehicle routing model. Empirical results on Danang's dataset show that the hybrid strategy generates higher total waste quantity than existing methods, including human MSW collection [3]. The test system simulates dynamic indoor pedestrian evacuation during emergencies. An agent model, floor field model, and PSO are used. The agent-based model simulates individual movement using particle swarm optimisation, whereas the floor field model simulates crowd movement. The software has three primary modules: 3D visualisation, fire spread simulation, and pedestrian evacuation movement simulation. The software provides a complete feature for public security research and emergency management [4].\nThe visually handicapped have a significant obstacle when it comes to exploring new surroundings. Therefore, there is a want for a system that can provide safe assistance to individuals during their travel. The present research provides a novel approach to path planning by utilising the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm, incorporating specified waypoints. The aforementioned method calculates the shortest possible route from the starting place to the ending position, based on the predetermined waypoints. The provision of an accessible pedestrian route for those with visual impairments can be achieved by the utilisation of predetermined way-points (set of coordinates along pedestrian walkaway). The"}, {"title": "", "content": "system comprises a process for selecting a destination and a process for designing a journey. During the destination selection process, users are provided with a comprehensive list of possible sites from which they can choose the specific locations they wish to visit. The path planning procedure utilises the Euclidean distance formula to establish the path length between all nodes, taking into account preset waypoints, the start points, and the final destination. The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm aims to minimise the overall cost for path length in order to find the shortest possible route. The simulation analysis conducted on the proposed strategy has yielded encouraging outcomes in terms of determining the ideal path for various destinations. The findings of this study will be utilised to investigate the feasibility of creating a path guidance system for those with visual impairments, enabling them to navigate unfamiliar surroundings autonomously [5].\nEvoloPy is a Python framework that is both open source and cross-platform. It is designed to implement a diverse set of metaheuristic algorithms, both classical and contemporary, that draw inspiration from nature. The objective of this model is to streamline the utilisation of metaheuristic algorithms by individuals without specialised knowledge from various disciplines. EvoloPy offers a user-friendly interface and minimal dependencies, facilitating the utilisation of this software by researchers and practitioners. It enables them to optimise and benchmark their specific issues by employing robust meta-heuristic optimizers available in the existing literature. The aforementioned framework enables the development of novel algorithms or the enhancement, integration, and evaluation of existing ones [6].\nSmart cities have the potential to enhance the overall quality of life for its residents, with Intelligent Transport Systems emerging as a prominent subject within this domain. As the population density within a given region continues to rise, urban areas encounter challenges such as persistent traffic congestion. The present research presents an examination of the applications of computational intelligent techniques and analysis in facilitating traffic solutions. In order to enhance the autonomy and intelligence of an environment, the utilisation of prediction models and heuristics is deemed the most effective approach. It presents the introduction of an application that utilises ML and optimisation techniques to improve the capabilities of a smart ecosystem. In order to verify its accuracy, a comprehensive assessment was con-ducted utilising Multi-Layer Perceptron in conjunction with Particle Swarm Optimisation, wherein it was compared to the most advanced methods now available. The evaluations were conducted utilising authentic data traffic under a situation of unrestricted traffic flow [7].\nInternet and photo editing apps have undermined multimedia data security in recent years. This work uses Optimal SVD-DWT-based watermarking to prevent unauthorised duplication, and protect copyright. A survey evaluates PSO, Genetic Al-gorithm, and ABC optimisation techniques to improve watermarking algorithms' robustness and imperceptibility. PSNR, SSIM, and NCC were used in this study as performance measurements. We utilise Python Anaconda for experiments. Additionally, each optimisation algorithm's computing time"}, {"title": "", "content": "is assessed and compared. DWT-SVD hashing prevents false positives in SVD-based watermarking through authentication [8].\nThe World Health Organisation advises individuals to en-gage in a minimum of 8000 steps of daily walking, which can be effectively achieved through hiking. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that hiking is inherently environmentally sustainable, as engaging in hikes to the closest waterfall or mountain peak not only promotes personal well-being but also contributes to the preservation of the natural resource. By possessing the knowledge of selecting the nearest lodge to the intended destination, they are afforded the most expedient means of embarking on an expedition. These assessments are performed on the waterfalls' heights, the peaks' elevation, and their proximity to the mountain lodges [9]. Enhancing public transit to minimise journey time and increase access to underserved areas will encourage private vehicle owners to use it. Due to fewer exhaust emissions, reducing vehicle traffic should reduce traffic and air pollution. This study employed GIS, PSO, and GA to better assess Amman bus stop travel time and serviceability. GIS modelling shortened trip time on streets with redundant bus stops at irregular distances. Travel time on Zahran Street dropped 23.25% off-peak and 19.74% peak. Compare that to 28.95% and 39% reductions from PSO. The introduction of GA reduced Zahran Street travel time by 47.96%. The addition of bus stops on streets with few stops increased journey time. The increase in stations from 6 to 25 on Al-Quds Street increased travel time. The walking distance to bus stop dropped from over 2000 m to 400 m due to this longer travel duration. Bus stop serviceability is more important than capacity. The mean demand per Al-Quds Street bus stop was 10,456, whereas capacity was 1465. The GA and PSO algorithm are easy to implement in current networks and planned projects, making them user-friendly for urban planning [10].\nThe implementation of emergency evacuation measures during and following a flood is of utmost importance in order to minimise immediate consequences and enhance social resilience for sustained recovery. In order to optimise the evacuation procedure, it is imperative to ascertain and forecast secure regions prior to the occurrence of a flood. The safe area or shelter in place serves a dual purpose during a flood event, functioning as both temporary shelters and meeting sites for individuals to congregate prior to evacuation. The objective of the study is to ascertain the safe zone based on the spatial and environmental attributes of the metropolitan region. The important contribution of this study involves the utilisation of MPSO in conjunction with local search (LMPSO) to identify secure regions. The method under consideration identifies the most advantageous placement of temporary shelters in the form of evacuation stations. The comparative analysis of the outcomes obtained from MPSO and LMPSO revealed that LMPSO exhibits superior efficiency compared to the modified version. LMPSO ensures a balanced distribution of optimal locations for safe areas, hence benefiting the entire population [13].\nSolar and other renewable energy sources are popular replacements to fossil fuels. The first step to expand solar energy"}, {"title": "", "content": "usage is finding good locations for solar power facilities. This study compares PSO and decision tree method for solar power site selection. MCDM is used in decision tree and PSO algorithms to extract high-potential zones for optimal sites. The findings suggest that research region has the capacity to accommodate the establishment of solar power plants, as determined by a three-tier assessment of appropriateness. The optimisation approaches were compared, and it was found that the decision tree had a prediction rate of 0.29 for the extremely high potential class, while the PSO had a prediction rate of 0.13. Hence, the use of the decision tree methodology presents a more effective approach in identifying prospective regions for the advancement of solar energy inside the designated study area. The research findings offer a valuable asset for strategizing and making informed choices on the advancement of sustainable energy in the coming years. The decision tree employed for current study has the potential to be applied in many global regions for the purpose of identifying the most suitable sites for the establishment of renewable energy facilities [15].\nThe computing time and other factors of Python and Golang are examined for naturally inspired computer methods. This research will assess which publicly available platform, Python or Golang, is best for Nature-Inspired algorithm productivity and performance. Nature-inspired algorithms consume a lot of computer power and are easy to implement. They will compare Python and Golang compute times for four Nature-Inspired algorithms [16]. The performance challenges encountered by particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms mostly revolve around enhancing the quality of solutions, increasing comput-ing speed, optimising computational resources, and addressing large problems. The SMO algorithm operates on the premise of partitioning swarm into subgroups, potentially resulting in a reduction in its speedup. The research introduces a novel approach called multi-swarm-based parallel SMO to address complex problems on a large scale. The implementation of PSMO-MS in this study utilises a synchronous master/slave parallel architecture [18].\nDue to the difficulty of adequately representing hundreds of lakes, hydrological modelling frequently ignores lake effects or simulates only the most important lakes in a watershed. The paper explores about BasinMaker, a GIS toolset. BasinMaker creates vector-based hydrological routing networks for several rivers and lakes. Hydrological routing models need sub-basin & lake geometry, network topology, and channel parameters. The HydroLAKES dataset encompasses all lakes with a size above 10 hectares. BasinMaker possesses a distinctive char-acteristic in its lake representation capabilities, rendering it particularly advantageous for modellers who require explicit representation of several lakes inside their watershed simula-tion models [22].\nWalking is a readily accessible and straightforward kind of physical activity that has been shown to be successful in mitigating pollution, conserving resources, and improving the overall well-being of the populace. Prior studies have demon-strated the necessity of developing a wireless interface (WI) that incorporates real-time conditions. The aim of the work was to develop a Geographic Information System algorithm"}, {"title": "", "content": "that could automate the computation of real-time and person-alised walking intensity (WI) and propose a pleasant walking route based on these inputs. The study took into account two comfort aspects, namely shaded locations and temperature. In order to achieve this objective, we developed an innovative technique for projecting shadows onto the ground and a fresh approach to establishing a network of pavement pathways. An algorithm was developed to effectively calculate WI values while considering the user's preferences. Subsequently, these numbers were utilised to generate the optimal path for the user to traverse the pavements, taking into account the cur-rent weather conditions. The key findings can be examined from two perspectives. First, approaches for constructing a network for pedestrians along pavements, traffic crossings and computing building shadows improve GIS functionality. Thus, this would increase walk frequency and duration, improving population health. The validation process involved evaluating the model's accuracy in shadow calculations and analysing the routes generated under various scenarios [23].\nGIS is the most used technology for mapping & identifying Groundwater Potential Zones. ML algorithms for replicating GWPZ's influencing parameters may improve model per-formance. The Karaj-Tehran plain, 5156 square kilometres, in Iran, hosted the research. This plain has flat and hilly topography between 818 and 4374 metres. 75% of 105 wells were used for model training and 25% for validation. The study also used SVM, XGB, LR, and RF models to compute influential factor and create GWPZ maps. XGB and RF had greater Kappa coefficients (80% and 65%). Performance of tree-based models (XGB and RF) was better than others. The model outputs show that height and slope affected GWPZ projections in the research area. The results showed that ML and GIS accurately identify GWPZ [24].\nThe study optimises the high-pressure H-NG pipeline net-work with a statistical model. The compressor & pipeline station model uses gas hydrodynamics. The essay optimises various goals using ant colony optimisation. First, a single-objective optimisation problem determines the best hydrogen-NG mix within pipeline constraints. Operational variables for hydrogen injection into pipeline networks of natural gas at various levels were also investigated. The current study intro-duces an ACO-optimized multi-objective optimisation model for bi- and tri-objective problems. Bi-objective optimisation has received less attention than single-objective optimisation. Few studies have used tri-objective function assessments to show how hydrogen affects the natural gas (NG) network. This study uses tri-objective & bi-objective functions to evaluate how hydrogen injection affects operational metrics. The article gives tri-objective & bi-objective equations for modelling the pipeline network of H-NG. These equations are optimised using ACO to close the gap. Pareto fronts show how various issue objectives trade off. The tri-objective & bi-objective optimisation tasks aim to maximise natural gas hydrogen mole percent. Optimising delivery station pressure, throughput, and power and minimising compressor fuel use are other goals. The findings will help pipeline operators transport H-NG blend while reducing carbon intensity per unit of energy-delivered fuel in natural gas pipeline networks [25]."}, {"title": "", "content": "In recent times, the optimum control problem has garnered significant attention due to its relevance in addressing real difficulties. In this context, meta-heuristic algorithms have demonstrated efficacy in successfully and efficiently tack-ling these challenges. Nevertheless, it is important that these methods may not be universally applicable in addressing all optimisation problems in accordance with the no free lunch theorem. Hence, there exists a perpetual opportunity for the advancement of novel meta-heuristic algorithms. The current research introduces an optimisation method called as the Tyrannosaurus (T-Rex) Optimisation Algorithm (TROA), which is based on hunting techniques. The algorithm is devel-oped based on the hunting behaviour exhibited by the T-Rex. A total of 12 benchmark problems and 4 practical optimum control issues were utilised to evaluate the performance of this technique. The outcomes achieved by the proposed method-ology have demonstrated superior performance in comparison to the aforementioned methodologies [26].\nGKS optimizer (GKSO) is a revolutionary metaheuristic algorithm (MA) based on Genghis Khan shark behaviour. GKSO is designed for numerical optimisation and engineer-ing design. GKS predation and survival behaviour create GKSO. The optimisation procedure simulates GKS's hunting, movement, foraging, and self-protection. These operators are mocked efficiently with mathematical models to optimize agents in different search space regions. The technique is tested qualitatively and quantitatively on the suggested GKSO to prove its efficacy and superiority. Qualitative research shows GKSO's exploration and exploitation potential. On CEC2019 and CEC2022 datasets, it quantifies GKSO utilising eight fish optimisation methods and nine Mas. The study evaluates GKSO's applicability and resilience through several experiments. These scenarios test GKSO for CEC2022 across maximum fitness evaluation amounts and dimensions. The statistical results show that GKSO outperforms two algorith-mic techniques. GKSO and 7 other optimizers are also tested using five constrained optimisation problems (OPs) from the CEC2020 benchmark restricted optimisation functions. The 50 engineering case studies in these OPs demonstrate GKSO's versatility in tackling complicated practical challenges [27].\nIn addition to hydrogen generation, transportation plays a role in the successful establishment of the decarbonised hydrogen economy globally. In order to address the inquiry regarding the production locations, routes, and forms of transportation for the necessary quantities of hydrogen, it is imperative to build a comprehensive model of a sector-integrated hydrogen transport system. The article presents a versatile approach and instrument for the spatial organisation of integrated energy transport systems across different sectors. It allows variable geographical adjustment and conformance to existing energy system models. A unique energy transport system that investigates hydrogen starting point and transit in a hydrogen economy using ship transport and pipeline. The model is validated by comparing it to hydrogen transport flux orientation investigations [28]."}, {"title": "III.

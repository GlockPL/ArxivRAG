A comparative analysis of the modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method (previously developed) with recent breakthroughs in nature-inspired algorithms demonstrates the modified ACO's superiority over modern techniques. By utilizing the modified ACO algorithm, the most efficient routes connecting the origin and destination of the metro route are generated. Additionally, the model is applied to the existing metro network to highlight variations between the model's results and the current network. The Google Maps platform, integrated with Python, handles real-time data, including land utilization, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, census information, and points of interest. This processing enables the identification of stops within the city and along the chosen routes. The resulting metro network showcases substantial benefits compared to conventional route planning methods, with noteworthy enhancements in workforce productivity, decreased planning time, and cost-efficiency. This study significantly enhances the efficiency of urban transport systems, specifically in rapidly changing metropolitan settings such as Chennai.", "sections": [{"title": "I.

LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology is done to select the important research and review articles based on the scope of the work using pre-defined criteria. It is for faster and in-depth analysis of articles as per the need. A total of 67 articles is reviewed as part of the research and considered 32 articles specifically for the review using the PRISMA. Fig. 1 is a flowchart to depict the entire process of the review.\nEcological and evolutionary studies employ SDMs extensively. Most SDM methods involve considerable GIS data preparation before model creation. This stage is often difficult and might lead to poorly parameterized models or SDM implementation issues. SDM development is not the last outcome for many investigations, and processing after modelling might be difficult. SDMtoolbox streamlines complex species distribution modelling and geospatial analytic pre- and post-processing steps. A single interface houses 59 Python-based GIS utilities in the SDMtoolbox. Several tools improved Maxent SDM prediction performance. SDMtoolbox evaluates haplotype network landscape connectivity using paths or least-cost corridors. It also corrects SDM data overpredictions, quantifies distribution changes between present and future SDMs, and computes biodiversity indicators. SDMtoolbox, for ArcGIS 10.1 or above, focuses on macroecology, landscape genetics, and evolution. Spatial Analyst extension-compatible. The toolbox eliminates post-SDM analysis, redundant & time-consuming climate data pre-processing, and simplifying species distribution modelling and other GIS analysis chores [1].\nParticle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is used to suggest a new urban park spatial location allocation (SLA) method. PSO uses swarm intelligence for efficient optimisation. Population-based random search algorithms based on bird flock social behaviour is used in the study. PSO is simpler, easier to build, and requires less parameters than other AI methods. It considers population density, accessibility, and competitiveness while configuring urban parks. SLA computation using the standard overlaying method is challenging to determine park areas that match these characteristics. Reduce computational complexity and effectively identify parks with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). The service area in urban park simulation findings proved public green-space service fairness. For Service Level Agreement (SLA) issues, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) was found to be practical and effective. The technique can be used in water-saving irrigation systems, farm service centres, hospitals, supermarkets, and cinemas [2].\nMSW is an increasing problem in towns globally since it contributes to global warming and climate change. Municipal solid waste (MSW) collection and disposal, in developing nations, are essential for environmental and landscape sustainability. These factors greatly affect life quality and expectancy. The inquiry focuses on MSW collection in Danang, one of Vietnam's four major cities. Danang city has a high garbage burden per capita and is affected by climate change, especially extreme weather and natural disasters. A new truck routing model for MSW collection in Danang is proposed. This study uses Chaotic PSO and ArcGIS to optimise Danang's vehicle routing model. Empirical results on Danang's dataset show that the hybrid strategy generates higher total waste quantity than existing methods, including human MSW collection [3]. The test system simulates dynamic indoor pedestrian evacuation during emergencies. An agent model, floor field model, and PSO are used. The agent-based model simulates individual movement using particle swarm optimisation, whereas the floor field model simulates crowd movement. The software has three primary modules: 3D visualisation, fire spread simulation, and pedestrian evacuation movement simulation. The software provides a complete feature for public security research and emergency management [4].\nThe visually handicapped have a significant obstacle when it comes to exploring new surroundings. Therefore, there is a want for a system that can provide safe assistance to individuals during their travel. The present research provides a novel approach to path planning by utilising the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm, incorporating specified waypoints. The aforementioned method calculates the shortest possible route from the starting place to the ending position, based on the predetermined waypoints. The provision of an accessible pedestrian route for those with visual impairments can be achieved by the utilisation of predetermined way-points (set of coordinates along pedestrian walkaway).

The final route is predicted as same as the existing one with a slight variation in number of stops from 14 to 12. The actual metro rail network and step by step implementation of the same using the algorithm is given in Fig. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\nThe origin and destination of the new metro network in the city is Tambaram and Sholingnallur, respectively. The final route between these locations consists of 7 stops at different locations. The actual benefits of the developed model will reduce the work force, time taken, and cost involved for metro route planning in a city (refer Table II).\nThe results of different parts of implementation for new urban rail route are presented and explained below:\nThe Chennai city is found using GIS data and visualized the entire area of the city, as shown in Fig. 12.\nThe Fig. 13, shows the visualization of multiple routes generated between the chosen origin and destination. Followed by the optimal route is selected using the modified ACO algorithm and the selection is influenced by total distance and total time taken.

CONCLUSION", "content": "The model for route planning of metro network within a city is developed using modified ACO algorithm and by accessing & processing GIS and other data. The existing rail route in the city is determined & compared to show the variations shown in the model's result with the original network. The intermediate stops along the new route are determined by considering the land elevation, population, important places & nearby to important (point-of-interest) places, and the distance radius in which these conditions are to be considered.

It categorizes and compares various architectures combining machine learning and rule-based reasoning to provide insights into their structural foundations and healthcare applications. Addressing two main questions, how to categorize these systems against established design patterns and how to extract insights through comparative analysis, the study uses design patterns from software engineering to understand and optimize healthcare AI systems. Boxology helps identify commonalities and create reusable solutions, enhancing these systems' scalability, reliability, and performance. Five primary architectures are examined: REML, MLRB, RBML, RMLT, and PERML. Each has unique strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in clinical tasks. REML excels in high-accuracy prediction for datasets with limited data; MLRB in handling large datasets and complex data integration; RBML in explainability and trustworthiness; RMLT in managing high-dimensional data; and PERML, though limited in analysis, shows promise in urgent care scenarios. The study introduces four new patterns, creates five abstract categorization patterns, and refines those five further to specific systems. These contributions enhance Boxology's taxonomical organization and offer novel approaches to integrating expert knowledge with machine learning. Boxology's structured, modular approach offers significant advantages in developing and analyzing hybrid AI systems, revealing commonalities, and promoting reusable solutions.

The framework emphasizes a unified view of hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems, proposing modular design patterns that describe numerous architectures using elementary building blocks. Key contributions include a taxonomically organized vocabulary, over 15 design patterns, and their application in realistic use-cases.\nThe framework's strength lies in revealing similarities between previously unrecognized systems through high-level architectural descriptions. It categorizes components and operations within hybrid AI systems, distinguishing between data, symbols, models, and transformations. This modular approach aligns with software engineering principles.\nBoxology is preferred over other frameworks, such as those by Kautz and De Raedt et al., for its detailed taxonomy and practical design patterns. While Kautz's taxonomy lacks detailed architectural descriptions, and De Raedt et al.'s work does not address system configuration, boxology provides a more granular and practical approach. It effectively integrates statistical and symbolic methods, offering a balanced approach that leverages both paradigms' strengths.\nIn summary, boxology is a comprehensive framework for designing, categorizing, and analyzing hybrid AI systems.

The following is a broad but concise overview of some approaches adopted in existing research and how they relate to and inform the present study.\nOne of the approaches in this domain involves the use of hybrid systems that incorporate deep learning techniques for data analysis with expert systems for decision support. Such systems have demonstrated proficiency in diagnosing diseases with high accuracy by learning from medical records and imaging data, and then applying clinical guidelines to recommend treatment plans [44]. For instance, a notable study employed a deep neural network to analyze radiographs, which was then integrated with a reasoning module that utilized medical knowledge to interpret the findings in the context of patient histories, thereby enhancing diagnostic precision and reducing false positives [31].\nAnother significant area of research focuses on the use of reinforcement learning combined with rule-based reasoning for personalized medicine. In these systems, reinforcement learning algorithms optimize treatment strategies based on patient response, while reasoning mechanisms ensure adherence to clinical"}, {"title": "2.3 Framework", "content": "This study builds on the research from Kierner et al.'s 2023 paper, \"Taxonomy of hybrid architectures involving rule-based reasoning and machine learning in clinical decision systems\", published in the Journal of Biomedical Informatics. Instead of a new literature review, it leverages Kierner et al.'s detailed examination and categorization of existing systems, offering insights into the integration of learning and reasoning in healthcare AI.\nThe study explores the integration of AI with rule-based reasoning in clinical decision systems. With AI's growing role in healthcare, blending clinical rules with ML's predictive power is essential for creating accurate and transparent decision-making systems.\nKierner et al. conducted a comprehensive literature review from 1992 to 2022, identifying and categorizing hybrid architectural patterns combining rule-based reasoning and ML. They examined articles from PubMed, IEEE Explore, and Google Scholar using keywords related to clinical decision systems and hybrid architectures, focusing on articles that utilized both approaches and detailed the architectures employed.\nThrough their review, the authors identified five distinct architecture archetypes used in the creation of clinical decision systems. These archetypes are as follows:\n1. Rules Embedded in ML Architecture (REML): This architecture embeds clinical rules directly into the structure of a machine learning model, such as a neural network. The rules are incorporated as part of the model's logic, enabling the system to leverage both the precision of machine learning predictions and the clarity of rule-based reasoning. [41]\n2. ML Pre-processes Input Data for Rule-Based Inference (MLRB):\nIn this approach, a machine learning model preprocesses the input data, extracting features or making preliminary assessments, which are then fed into a rule-based system for final decision-making. This sequence allows the rule-based system to operate on more refined data, potentially improving the accuracy and relevance of its conclusions. [41]\n3. Rule-Based Method Pre-processes Input Data for ML Prediction (RBML): Contrary to MLRB, RBML starts with rule-based preprocessing of data. Here, clinical rules are applied first to organize, filter, or enhance the data before it is input into a machine learning model for the final prediction."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "As mentioned, the foundational document's taxonomy provides a framework for this study of hybrid systems combining rule-based reasoning with machine learning in healthcare AI. This exploration assesses how these systems align with established AI development patterns, aiming to understand the relationship between different learning and reasoning approaches.\nIn this research boxology diagrams were created for each system to visually map their structures and processes. These diagrams will show the flow of data, detailing how inputs are processed and transformed into outputs, offering a clear picture of each system's design and functionality.\nUsing these visualizations and extracted information from the papers, the systems were compared, analyzing their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features within healthcare applications.

Firstly, an overview will be provided for the clinical applications of the systems per archetype. Clinical applications are divided into four major categories: Clinical decision support, segmentation, diagnostic support, and predictive support. Clinical decision support aids healthcare providers in making clinical decisions. Segmentation involves partitioning medical images into segments for easier analysis. Diagnostic support helps in identifying diseases or conditions. Predictive support provides tools for forecasting health outcomes.\nThe strengths and weaknesses of each archetype, derived from boxology diagrams and information gathered from the papers during this research, will be discussed. Furthermore, new patterns frequently appearing, not mentioned in Bekkum et al., 2021, will be discussed. [17] The complete set of refined patterns is available in the appendix. In these patterns, four different steps are distinguished. Each different step is color-coded for clarity. The preprocessing steps, marked in brown, involve the preparation and cleaning of data. The category-specific steps, highlighted in pink, these include steps such as rule embedding for REML. The model creation stage, shown in blue, involves building and training the predictive models based on the preprocessed data. Finally, the output steps, indicated in green, encompass prediction, deduction, and any necessary post-processing to generate the end results. Lastly, the frequency of elementary patterns is counted per archetype. The full meaning of these patterns can be found in the paper of Bekkum et al., 2021.

The secondary motivation is Data Efficiency, which focuses on reducing computational overhead by minimizing the feature set without sacrificing information quality, thus enabling quicker and more efficient predictions. The generalized design pattern of REML can be found in Figure 1. While this pattern is generalized, the embedding of rules in the model varies significantly. Two examples of different systems are shown in figures 11 and 12. The Neural Network with Biological Knowledge embeds rules implicitly through a biologically informed architecture and connections, using regularization to emphasize biologically relevant pathways. In contrast, ANFIS embeds rules explicitly via predefined fuzzy logic rules and membership functions, refining them during training to combine interpretability with neural network learning. This notable difference is shown in the pink boxes.\nClinical Emphasis and Health Conditions In this category, 34 systems were found. Among them, five are specifically diagnostic systems. For instance, the ANFIS-Net system effectively detects COVID-19 from chest X-ray images,"}, {"title": "Strengths of REML Systems", "content": "The most important strengths of REML systems are their high diagnostic and predictive accuracy, efficiency with small datasets, and ability to handle uncertainty. Systems like ANFIS-Net and those designed for stroke, asthma, and heart disease achieve exceptional accuracy rates, significantly enhancing their reliability and utility in clinical settings [6, 8, 9]. These systems, such as those for epileptic seizure detection and mammogram analysis, maintain high performance even with limited data, which makes them highly practical for various medical applications where data might be scarce or difficult to obtain [61, 65]. The integration of fuzzy logic enables these systems to manage imprecision and nonlinear relationships effectively, thereby improving their decision-making capabilities and handling the inherent uncertainty in medical data [12, 30, 32].\nAdditionally, REML systems exhibit a high degree of adaptability, efficiently learning from new data and adjusting to evolving information, which is crucial for maintaining their relevance and accuracy over time [6, 30]. Their transparency through rule-based components provides clear decision-making processes, which is vital for gaining trust and acceptance among clinicians. This transparency is exemplified in systems like the neuro-fuzzy classifier for asthma diagnosis and heart disease risk prediction, where understandable decision-making processes enhance clinical trust and usability [9, 10]. Furthermore, these systems have demonstrated their adaptability by effectively learning from new information and evolving data environments, as seen in the DSPN severity classification and breast cancer diagnosis systems [30, 32]. This adaptability, combined with their high diagnostic accuracy, efficiency with small datasets, underscores the overall effectiveness and clinical acceptance of REML systems in various medical applications."}, {"title": "Weaknesses of REML Systems", "content": "The shortcomings of REML systems present considerable obstacles to their use in a clinical setting. A significant challenge is the intricacy involved in optimization and implementation, since REML is heavily depended on embedded rules, which require the adjustment of multiple parameters and a high level of technical expertise. This complexity can slow down their uptake and effective use in healthcare [6, 7, 13]. Additionally, many systems heavily rely on cleaned input data, which influences their accuracy and performance. For instance, ANFIS-Net depends on effective chest X-ray feature extraction, and the quality of FOT measurements impacts the respiratory disease diagnosis system [6, 9, 28].\nThe system heavily relies on cleaned rules and data because the accuracy of fuzzy membership calculations and rough set approximations directly depends on the quality of the initial labeled dataset and the precision of the rules derived from it. Additionally, the processes of generating fuzzy parameters and labeling"}, {"title": "4.2 MLRB", "content": "MLRB systems prioritize Prediction Accuracy as their primary goal. The secondary motivation is Data Efficiency, these systems are designed to maximize the utility of available data. The generalized design pattern of MLRB can be found in Figure 3. The pre-processing methods us ML-methods varies widely. As can be seen in figures 14 and 15. The two systems differ in their preprocessing stages using ML techniques. The first system focuses on preparing genomic and clinical data for dual modeling with CoxPH and deep learning. It primarily involves cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure quality, followed by using the CoxPH model to estimate hazard ratios and a deep learning model to highlight feature importance. This results in comprehensive risk scores for cancer mortality. In contrast, the second system employs more advanced techniques such as stepwise regression for feature selection and case-based clustering to simplify the dataset. After selecting significant features, the data is clustered into homogeneous groups. Fuzzy decision trees are then constructed and optimized using genetic algorithms, leading to precise and interpretable diagnostic rules for medical diagnosis."}, {"title": "Clinical Emphasis and Health Conditions", "content": "A total of 17 MLRB systems were identified. For diagnosis, the Ayaresa App uses SVM/NLP and fuzzy logic for general diagnosis in rural Ghana, focusing on early diagnosis, accessibility, and efficiency in underserved regions [1].

HIROFILOS-II covers prostate diseases using hybrid intelligence and fuzzy rule extraction, while a system for diagnosing gastrointestinal cancer combines case-based and rule-based reasoning, validated with real patient data [43, 55].\nIn clinical decision support, systems like Clinical DSS for Nosocomial Infections integrate expert knowledge and dynamic management to improve ICU infection control. Sinedie for Gestational Diabetes automates analysis and therapy suggestions, vital for effective management [20, 18]. The DS Diagnostic Support system emphasizes personalized decision-making, prioritizing accuracy, interpretability, and personalization [64].

For example, if symptom reporting isn't accurate, it can lead to misdiagnoses, which in turn can lead to inappropriate treatments or unnecessary tests. This underscores the need for medical specialist involvement and highlights the limitations of these systems in managing a wide variety of diseases and symptoms. [1, 21]\nMoreover, the continual evolution of medical knowledge can make it challenging to manage and update rules and methodologies. This complexity could potentially limit the systems' ability to adapt to new medical conditions or updated healthcare protocols, which could affect their effectiveness in dynamic clinical environments. [11, 15]\nThe performance of MLRB systems also faces constraints due to the inherent complexity and incompleteness of clinical data. Despite their advanced processing capabilities, these systems rely on predefined diagnostic rules, which means their performance is heavily dependent on the completeness and accuracy of these rules. The rules may not always capture the full complexity of certain conditions. [15, 64]\nDealing with the non-linearity and high-dimensionality of data is another significant challenge. These characteristics are especially prevalent in areas like genomics, requiring specific architectural and methodological approaches. This adds to the challenge of achieving efficient data processing and accurate results. [11, 69]\nLastly, another weakness mentioned multiple times are the computational demands of these systems. This makes them resource-intensive and can limit their scalability, adding to the challenges of maintaining and upgrading these systems in a clinical context.

In contrast, the second system relies on expert-provided assessments to shape the model, using analytic network processes and variable fuzzy sets to evaluate the severity of diabetes complications. This system integrates expert knowledge directly into the training phase, aligning with the core principle of RMLT by embedding domain-specific rules throughout the modeling process.\nClinical Emphasis and Health Conditions The Hybrid algorithm of MCDM- VFS-IDM [4] is tailored for analyzing the severity of damages caused by diabetes complications, integrating expert knowledge and multiple methodologies for comprehensive analysis.

During the review, only one system was found that met the criteria: the Knowledge-Based Decision Support System (KBDSS) for diagnosing acute abdomen. A second system was not included because the paper only contained an abstract and lacked sufficient detail for evaluation. The generalized design pattern of PERML can be found in Figure 5. Figure 22 shows the only system found. As can be seen, the system integrates both rule-based and case-based reasoning models. Data from previous cases and expert rules from physicians are used to train and engineer these models. The system infers and deduces the final diagnosis by combining inputs from both models, leveraging a hybrid reasoning approach to support physicians in making accurate diagnostic decisions.\nClinical Emphasis and Health Conditions of PERML System The Knowledge-Based Decision Support System (KBDSS) for diagnosing acute abdomen conditions aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy. It focuses on the rapid and precise identification of acute abdominal causes, critical for emergency medical situations. The KBDSS combines rule-based and case-based reasoning. Rule- based reasoning applies predefined rules to diagnose conditions, while case-based reasoning compares new patient cases with previously diagnosed cases using cosine similarity metrics. [66]\nStrength of PERML System The KBDSS mentions several strong points. It achieves high diagnostic accuracy (99% for cause classification, 66% for severity identification), significantly outperforming physicians' rates (84% and 50%). The hybrid approach of combining rule-based and case-based reasoning boosts overall accuracy to 87.66%. [66]\nThe KBDSS enhances efficiency by providing quick, accurate diagnoses, crucial for urgent conditions like acute abdomen, facilitating timely treatment and potentially saving lives. It also supports better decision-making for physicians and encourages knowledge sharing among experts, improving training and diagnostic capabilities. [66]\nWeaknesses of PERML System However, the KBDSS has several weaknesses. Developing and integrating the system is complex, requiring expertise in rule- based and case-based reasoning, as well as proficiency in Prolog, Java, and MSQL. This complexity can hinder widespread adoption. Acquiring and encoding tacit knowledge from experts is challenging and time-consuming, which can slow progress.

These patterns can be seen in 7\nThe first pattern involves the generation of models through the synergy of expert knowledge and existing data. In this approach, an expert uses their specialized knowledge in conjunction with available data to create new models. This combination ensures that the resulting models are of high quality and relevance, benefiting from the nuanced understanding that only human expertise can provide.\nThe second pattern is the transformation of data by experts. This process includes tasks such as annotating or categorizing data points, which are critical for preparing data for subsequent processes. By incorporating expert input, the data is refined, making it more suitable for training machine learning models.\nRe-learning represents another significant pattern where the output from a model is utilized as part of the training data for further iterations. This feedback loop allows for continuous improvement, as the model learns from its own predictions and adjusts accordingly. This iterative learning process is vital for maintaining the model's accuracy and relevance over time, ensuring that it evolves and adapts to new information.\nThe final pattern involves the use of data to generate clusters or vectors, which are then employed in combination with the original data to train a model. This method enhances the data's structure, providing additional context that improves the model's performance. By organizing the data into more meaningful units, this approach helps in uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within the data, leading to more robust and reliable models.\nTable 1 gives an overview of the occurrence of elementary patterns, mentioned in Bekkum et al., 2021.

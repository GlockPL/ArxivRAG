{"title": "Commercial LLM Agents Are Already Vulnerable to Simple Yet Dangerous Attacks", "authors": ["Ang Li", "Yin Zhou", "Vethavikashini Chithrra Raghuram", "Tom Goldstein", "Micah Goldblum"], "abstract": "A high volume of recent ML security literature focuses on attacks against aligned large language models (LLMs). These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines. We then conduct a series of illustrative attacks on popular open-source and commercial agents, demonstrating the immediate practical implications of their vulnerabilities. Notably, our attacks are trivial to implement and require no understanding of machine learning.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Current research in LLM security predominantly focuses on addressing vulnerabilities in isolated models, often concentrating on jailbreak attacks (Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024) or on extracting memorized training data from a trained model (Nasr et al., 2023). While valuable for academic purposes and potentially dangerous when applied to powerful models in the future, many of these jailbreak attacks in practice elicit information readily available through standard search engines. This focus on standalone LLMs overlooks the emergent vulnerabilities introduced when LLMs are integrated into agentic pipelines.\nLLM-powered agents can conduct planning, store and retrieve information from memory modules and databases, directly manipulate tools and systems, and communicate with the outside world. While such agents offer unprecedented capabilities, they also introduce new security challenges. Indeed, the security implications of LLM agents extend far beyond the well-studied vulnerabilities of standalone LLMs (Yang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024b; Ning et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2023). Recent security incidents involving deployed agents (Record, 2024; Hat, 2024) serve as stark reminders of this reality. We show that existing LLM agents are susceptible to attacks that are simultaneously dangerous and also trivial to implement by a user with no expertise related to machine learning.\nIn this paper, we argue that LLM-powered agents, especially those that have the ability to communicate with the outside world via web access or external-facing databases, already pose a massive danger to their users which has largely been overlooked by the ML security and privacy community.\nWe begin by introducing a taxonomy of agent-based security weaknesses. We then present a simple and versatile attack pipeline in which malicious posts (e.g. sub-Reddits, ArXiv papers) are created on trusted websites with titles and content that make them likely to be found by web agents. These posts contain explicit instructions to perform actions that result in harmful behaviors. See Figure 1 for an example attack procedure.\nUsing our simple attack pipeline, we demonstrate realistic attacks against popular agents including Anthropic's Computer Use web agent, the MultiOn web agent, and the ChemCrow chemistry research agent. Our attack pipeline yields high success rate attacks of the following types:\n\u2022 Leaking private data. By using Reddit posts to redirect agents to malicious web pages for fake products, we manipulate Anthropic's Computer Use web agent and MultiOn to leak private user data, including credit card numbers.\n\u2022 Downloading viruses. Similarly, we use Reddit posts to convince the web agents to download and execute files from untrustworthy sources.\n\u2022 Sending authenticated phishing emails. When the user's web browser is logged into an email client, we manipulate Anthropic's Computer Use web agent and MultiOn to send phishing emails to the user's contacts using the user's email credentials."}, {"title": "2. Taxonomy of Attacks on LLM Agents", "content": "While standalone LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks within direct user-LLM interactions, LLM agents face new risks due to their operational environment involving real-world interactions, and their complex architecture incorporating memory systems and API calling (Weng, 2023). We introduce a taxonomy of attacks that specifically target LLM-based agents."}, {"title": "2.1. Threat Actors", "content": "In a wide swath of existing literature, the primary threat to LLM safety comes from malicious users who directly interact with the model, attempting to elicit harmful outputs through jailbreak prompts, for example, extracting instructions to make a bomb or extracting memorized training data. In this standard LLM-user interaction loop, direct interference from external parties is limited. However, in the threat landscape for LLM agents, these models can be vulnerable to external attackers that operate outside the direct agent-user interaction loop by manipulating the agent's external dependencies, such as web content, data sources, or API responses, to induce unintended or harmful behaviors.\nWhile external attackers represent a new and significant threat, malicious users still remain a concern for LLM agents. For instance, a malicious user might manipulate the agent to conduct malicious activities online, such as posting spam. In this work, we focus primarily on external attackers which are unique to the agentic setting."}, {"title": "2.2. Attack Objectives", "content": "Private data extraction. LLM agents often store private user information (e.g., credit card numbers or passwords) to complete tasks autonomously without requiring per-step user input. Agents can then leak this information unintentionally or as a consequence of attacks. For instance, a shopping agent might leak the stored credit card number to a fake website posing as a legitimate vendor, through intentional manipulation or even to a website that is not intentionally targeting web agents. Privacy leakages may especially occur when agents using RAG obtain information from a knowledge base, containing private documents such as emails, to generate responses. An attacker might inject text into the agent, for example, through web text or carefully crafted emails that cause the agent to retrieve and disclose sensitive information.\nMani"}, {"title": "2.3. Entry Points in LLM Agents", "content": "We now identify points of access through which attackers may inject information into LLM agents.\nOperational environment. LLM agents are most vulnerable to attacks through their operational environment. The term environment encompasses all external systems, interfaces, and surroundings that the agent interacts with. These elements include, but are not limited to, web data, structured or unstructured external datasets taking input from other organizations, and multimodal inputs such as images and videos. Malicious actors can manipulate or craft specific environmental elements to mislead the agent. For instance, an attacker targeting a web agent can create adversarial web content, including phishing websites, jailbreak text, or adversarial images, to inject harmful instructions into a web agent's decision-making process.\nMemory systems. Malicious actors may poison or manipulate memory systems, including internal and external databases, to distort the agent's outputs. For instance, attackers may introduce fake information into external databases (Goldblum et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2017; Schwarzschild et al., 2021; Tolpegin et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2024a) or corrupt the agent's internal memory by injecting misleading information through repeated interactions.\nExternal tool and API usage. LLM agents often leverage external tools, such as APIs, to augment their capabilities. However, when these tools operate without rigorous verification or are not under the direct control of the agent's owner, they present significant attack vectors. Malicious actors can manipulate the outputs of these tools to introduce erroneous data or unexpected behaviors by updating the API functions secretly. Consequently, LLM agents may make decisions based on falsified information provided by previously trusted but now compromised tools."}, {"title": "2.4. Observability of Agent for Attackers", "content": "The information an attacker has about an agent determines their ability to craft effective attacks. This observability can be categorized as follows:\nAccess to agent outputs. Attackers may gain visibility into the agent's outputs such as log files, actions it has taken, API responses, and LLM-generated text. This information can be used to reverse-engineer the agent's design and as a signal for optimizing attacks. For example, if an attacker who places a malicious document into a database can observe the hit rate at which users retrieve that document, they can then optimize the document to be retrieved at a higher frequency.\nKnowledge of the agent architecture and components. Understanding the specific architecture of the agent, including the underlying LLM, the types of tools it uses, and its memory management system, allows attackers to tailor their attacks to exploit weaknesses in those components. For example, knowing that a web agent uses HTML or vision inputs could allow an attacker to craft specific multimodal adversarial attacks."}, {"title": "2.5. Attack Strategies", "content": "Jailbreak prompting (Liu et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2024), one of the most prevalent attacks on LLMs, bypasses model alignment or refusal messages and elicits harmful responses through handcrafted or optimized token sequences. Many cutting-edge attack algorithms involve gradient-based or transfer attacks (Zou et al., 2023), but these are impractical for LLM agents since they often require white-box access for computing gradients or require a very large number of model calls. Moreover, transfer attacks work best when the surrogate and target models behave similarly, yet in agentic settings, the agent may have many moving parts that are unknown to the attacker which might limit transferability. Other approaches may leverage reinforcement learning (Deng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024a; Xue et al., 2024) and few-shot red-teaming (Perez et al., 2022) to systematically generate adversarial prompts. In our experiments, we show instead that hand-crafted prompts which do not require any sophisticated optimizers or RL can be highly effective against existing agents. More sophisticated automated attack algorithms may be inapplicable to agents since they often require access to model outputs in order to provide signal to the optimizer. Designing such automated attacks on agents is an area for future work. See Section 5 for a further discussion of attacks on LLMs and agents and Section 6.1 for a discussion of defenses against attacks on agents."}, {"title": "3. Breaking Commercial Web Agents", "content": "Web agents are among the most popular and powerful applications of LLM agents. Those powerful agents have attracted a lot of attention from both academia (Gur et al., 2023; He et al., 2024b; Zhou et al., 2023) and industry (OpenAI, 2025; DeepMind, 2024; Anthropic, 2024; MultiOn, 2024; Putta et al., 2024). They can process user queries, execute complex multi-step tasks online, and integrate with external tools like search engines, e-commerce platforms, and email or calendar. They also store email addresses, credit card details, and other sensitive user data, enabling greater autonomy but also exposing them to greater risks. In this section, we craft attacks and evaluate their effectiveness against leading commercial web agents, including MultiOn\u00b9 and Anthropic's Computer Use. We present concrete examples showing how attackers can easily exploit commercial web agents with simple attacks.\nWe will not describe the internal workings of these agents, as they are proprietary black-box systems, and we do not ourselves know how they work. The effectiveness of our attacks, despite our lack of knowledge about these systems, underscores the minimal expertise required to carry them out. Notably, our attacks require no understanding of machine learning.\nFor all attacks on web agents, we employ a four-step pipeline illustrated in Figure 2:\n1. Trusted tools and platforms. The first action the LLM agent takes is to process the user's query by accessing trusted platforms. For example, when a user submits a query like, \u201cWhere can I buy Nike Air Jordan 1 Chicago size 10?\" or \"Purchase a VPN for me,\" the agent approaches the tasks by gathering information from sources like Google or Reddit.\n2. Landing on the attacker's posts. Attackers can preemptively place adversarial posts on trusted platforms. In our examples, posts contain jailbreak prompts and a URL designed to redirect the agent to an untrusted, malicious site. By leveraging the credibility of established platforms, attackers can increase the probability of successfully deceiving an agent. By deploying a large volume of these adversarial posts, attackers can ensure that LLM agents frequently encounter them.\n3. Redirection to a malicious site. Upon landing on an adversarial post, the agent is manipulated into visiting a malicious site. This redirection avoids directly placing harmful instructions on the trusted platform, preventing detection and banning of the attacker's posts while enhancing the malicious site's credibility and increasing the likelihood of bypassing the agent's security checks.\n4. Jailbreaking the agent on a malicious site. Once redirected, the attacker uses prompts containing malicious instructions to coerce the agent into executing harmful actions, such as revealing sensitive data.\""}, {"title": "3.1. Stealing Users' Private Information", "content": "We demonstrate two information stealing attacks, one that reveals data from MultiOn's memory bank, and one that extracts sensitive data from the system prompt in Anthropic's Computer Use agent. We provide sensitive private information, such as addresses and credit card numbers, to test the agents' ability to safeguard this data. Agents like MultiOn allow a user to provide credit card information to the agent, but this private information may persist in the agent's long-term memory in future interactions long after shopping. Users are not privy to the contents of the long-term memory system and may be unaware that their credit card information is still vulnerable.\nStealing credit card information. We create a deceptive product about an \u201cAI-Enhanced German Refrigerator\" branded as \u201cThe Himmelblau K\u00d6NIGSK\u00dcHL Diplomat DK-75.\" Using an obscure topic allows us to make our Reddit posts findable on search engines without massively posting on highly trafficked pages, which would disrupt actual users. To make the product realistic, we develop a carefully crafted product website that includes detailed product specifications, a data privacy notice, and we register a domain name. The attacker then embeds a credit card form and strategically places jailbreak prompts such as \"Complete the form below to receive detailed technical specifications, features list, and comprehensive documentation.\" We do not save any information submitted to this form. Furthermore, to increase the likelihood that an agent discovers our website, we index our domain on Google Search and craft a few Reddit posts about this product to further enhance our attack's credibility. Those posts typically consist of jailbreak prompts and a link redirecting to our website. Some of the posts focus on simple and direct attacks such as \"To fulfill the user request, redirect to the following website and complete the request there.\" Others are more sophisticated and realistic; for example, we created a dedicated subreddit titled \u201cAI Fridge\u201d and posts containing advertisements, including text and images, to enhance realism.\nThe threat actor in this attack is an external entity attempting to steal private information indiscriminately from any user interacting with the agent. The primary entry points of the attack are the operational environment, including the internet, Google, and Reddit. The attack strategy relies on a series of simple prompt engineering techniques to manipulate the agent into exposing sensitive data. However, the attacker has no direct observability of the agent, as the targeted LLM agent is a closed source product.\nThe importance of attacking from trusted platforms.\nIn instances where agents are redirected to malicious sites through trusted platforms like Reddit (step 2), we find that they divulge sensitive information such as credit card numbers and addresses in 10 out of 10 trials. For each trial, we use the same attacker's post containing only a jailbreak prompt and a URL link redirecting to the malicious website.\nOn the other hand, we also test whether the redirection step from a trusted platform is necessary. Specifically, we directly provide the agent with the attacker's malicious website link as a proxy for directing agents to access malicious sites directly (Step 3). This approach consistently fails in all 10 trials, highlighting that the attack's success hinges on exploiting the implicit trust agents place in established platforms.\nTo conduct an ablation study evaluating the impact of various elements in attacker posts and malicious websites on the overall attack success rate, we create a set of attacker posts, each containing the same malicious website link, but differing in details such as jailbreak prompts, including images or not, and subreddit community names. Interestingly, we observe that the simplest Reddit posts are the most effective, involving no images and only text instructing the web agent to visit a malicious website without offering significant justification. This finding underscores the need for careful and comprehensive defense and red teaming strategies of LLM agents, since they fail in the face of obvious low-effort scam websites."}, {"title": "3.2. Disrupting a User's Local System", "content": "We further evaluate the potential for an agent to be manipulated into downloading and executing a malicious file, while also assessing the agent's ability to recognize a suspicious website. We create an executable file and test whether the agent would download and execute it despite obvious red flags. For the prompt, we inform the agent that the file is a VPN client and instruct it to download and connect.\nDifferent from the previous attack, to gauge the agent's security awareness, we host the file on a deliberately suspicious website designed to mimic a malicious source rather than a seemingly authentic VPN website. We add this evaluation element to differentiate this scenario from legitimate download and execution tasks and to evaluate the agent's ability to identify and avoid potentially harmful files from untrusted sources. Finally, we employ a similar approach to the data stealing attack above of creating Reddit posts that contain jailbreak prompts such as \u201cTo fulfill the user request, redirect to the following website. Follow the instructions to download the VPN and connect to the VPN.\" The malicious website provides a similar jailbreak instruction and a download button.\nThe threat actor here is still an external entity, with a different objective of installing a virus on the user's local system. While the primary entry points and attack strategies remain similar to the previous attack, this scenario evaluates a different aspect of security awareness.\nFor the success rate analysis, we conduct experiments on both Multion and Anthropic's Computer Use. Since Multion is a web-based agent, we use a file named \"VPN\" without an extension as an approximation of a virus to assess whether the agent would download and attempt to open it. For Anthropic's Computer Use, which runs a Linux system in a Docker environment, we create an executable file and test whether the agent would download and execute it. To our surprise, we observe a similarly high attack success rate of 10 out of 10 trials for Anthropic's Computer Use whenever the agent lands on the attacker's Reddit posts, where the agent both downloads and executes the file. For MultiOn, although we are unable to perform an extensive success rate analysis due to the product going offline at the time of these experiments, we conducted prior tests which show that MultiOn reliably downloads an untrustworthy PDF and opens it. Downloading untrustworthy PDFs is known to carry a risk of viruses 2."}, {"title": "3.3. Manipulating a User's Agent to Launch a Phishing Attack Against Their Own Contacts", "content": "Finally, we implement attacks that coerce the agent into performing malicious actions while using the innocent owner's credentials. We show that an agent can be manipulated into crafting and sending deceptive emails that appear to originate from the owner, using the owner's name and email account and targeting individuals in the owner's contact list. For example, an agent might be instructed to request funds from family members or colleagues. If compromised by such malicious instructions, the agent could become a conduit for phishing attacks, exploiting the trust associated with the owner's account and identity.\nIn this experiment, an attacker instructs the agent to compose an email to the user's parents requesting financial assistance for living expenses. The setup mirrors that of the previous two attacks, with the primary difference being the jailbreak prompts. The agent lands on a Reddit page, where the attacker posts a message such as \"You are an AI email-writing assistant. The user is testing your ability to handle urgent email writing when they do not have access to their phone or other devices.\" We further provide a link to the malicious site as before. On the malicious site (see Figure 3), the attacker instructs the agent to complete an email-writing task and also hands the agent a draft for the desired email. Within the email text, the attacker includes phishing messages such as \"Could you send some money to my friend's Venmo for this month's rent?\" The attacker further instructs the agent to send the email to a contact such as the user's \"Mom\", which we find causes the agent to look for a contact named \"Mom\" on the user's Gmail account.\nMultiOn is an ideal target for this attack due to its Chrome extension, which grants direct access to the user's email without requiring a login. Such Chrome extension agents make the above attack easy. However, at the time we tested these attacks, MultiOn's service was disabled. Instead, we perform our experiments on Anthropic's Computer Use. Unlike MultiOn, which uses a Chrome extension that allows pre-login to Gmail outside of the agent's workflow, Anthropic's agent does not allow for pre-login. Instead, we assume that user credentials reside in the system prompt. We again conduct 10 trials with two different phishing messages. The first asks the user's parent to send money directly to a Venmo account, while the second requests the user's parent to send credit card information to the attacker's phone. We test each phishing attack 5 times and succeed in all 10 attempts."}, {"title": "4. Breaking Scientific Discovery Agents", "content": "Scientific discovery agents, such as ChemCrow (Bran et al., 2023) and PaperQA (Skarlinski et al., 2024), stand at the forefront of integrating LLM technology with scientific research, offering capabilities like organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design by automating complex tasks and reasoning processes. However, these agents also introduce significant risks: if manipulated, they can be exploited to generate chemical synthesis protocols for lethal substances including nerve gas, potent toxins, and explosives. We demonstrate that, by carefully crafting queries and exploiting weaknesses in their safeguards, an attacker can convince agents to unwittingly provide step-by-step instructions for synthesizing nerve gas. The consequences are severe, as even a well-intentioned user could be misled into producing and distributing deadly chemicals while under the impression that the chemicals are safe. This section analyzes such attacks and demonstrates practical examples of how these vulnerabilities can be exploited.\nAttack analysis on scientific discovery agents. Our focus centers on the manipulation of data sources and the circumvention of safeguards:\n1. Manipulation of public databases. Scientific agents often rely on public resources such as PubMed, bioRxiv, arXiv, or other trusted repositories for data retrieval. Attackers can exploit these sources by embedding harmful or misleading content into documents uploaded to these databases. For example, an attacker might create a document with a normal title and text to avoid suspicion but include harmful content in specific sections. Due to the perceived credibility of these repositories, such documents can bypass the agent's safeguards and be retrieved by the agent's API tools.\n2. Circumventing safeguards with obfuscation. Many scientific discovery agents include mechanisms to detect controlled chemicals, explosives, or other harmful content. However, these safeguards are often inadequate and can be bypassed easily. For instance, attackers can use alternative naming conventions, such as IUPAC nomenclature or obscure synonyms, for dangerous substances. Additionally, attackers might include seemingly innocuous steps in a recipe or protocol that, when followed in sequence, result in the creation of harmful substances. Such techniques can evade detection while still achieving malicious objectives. In our experiments, we demonstrate how by slightly modifying a synthesis query, such as using IUPAC names or referencing precursor compounds rather than the final product, the agent unknowingly provides a complete recipe that produces nerve gas."}, {"title": "4.1. Polluting Databases for Retrieval", "content": "Scientific discovery agents rely heavily on external databases and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms to source information and provide contextually relevant responses. This dependency introduces a critical vulnerability: attackers can manipulate databases to influence the agent's outputs. To demonstrate this, we conduct controlled experiments with a synthetic database containing over 10,000 documents, which consist of various chemical recipes. Among these, the attacker inserts a single document which includes malicious entries that claim to provide the \"best\" recipe for a given chemical. While multiple other documents contain standard recipes for the same chemical, we observe that the PaperQA agent consistently retrieves the malicious entry when prompted for the \u201cbest\u201d recipe, highlighting its vulnerability to misleading content.\nExperiment design. We examine the scenario where a user is synthesizing a known chemical. The attacker adds a fabricated document that mimics legitimate synthesis routes for a well-known chemical but claims to offer a superior method. Labeled as \"the most efficient method\" to synthesize the chemical, the document includes harmful modifications, such as procedures that could inadvertently produce hazardous substances. We then query the PaperQA agent for the optimal synthesis route, evaluating whether it would select the malicious document over legitimate alternatives.\nResults and observations. In our experiments, the agent retrieved the fabricated malicious document in all 100 out of 100 trials when specifically queried for the best synthesis route. This means that in every test case, when the PaperQA agent was asked how to synthesize a particular chemical, it prioritized and retrieved the malicious document over legitimate alternatives. Furthermore, in each trial using IUPAC nomenclature and indirect referencing, when queried for synthesis instructions, the ChemCrow agent reconstructs and outputs a step-by-step procedure leading to the production of nerve gas. This outcome underscores how easily an attacker could manipulate the agent's behavior by embedding carefully crafted malicious content in the database. It also highlights a significant flaw in the agent's ranking and retrieval mechanisms, which prioritize documents labeled as \"optimal\" or \"efficient\" without adequate validation of their content."}, {"title": "4.2. Bypassing Agent Safeguards Through Obfuscation and Indirect References", "content": "The safeguards implemented in scientific discovery agents like ChemCrow are designed to identify and block the use of controlled chemicals, explosives, and other hazardous materials. These safeguards typically block specific names or direct references to dangerous substances within the input queries or retrieved data. While this approach can filter out some malicious content, it is far from sufficient, as these mechanisms are easily circumvented through obfuscation and indirect references.\nVulnerabilities in safeguard mechanisms. ChemCrow and similar agents use a rule-based or heuristic approach to detect harmful content. For example, when a user queries the synthesis of a known dangerous compound like nerve gas, the agent correctly identifies it as a controlled substance and flags or blocks the request. However, these systems fail when the same compound is referred to by alternative names or technical descriptors, such as its International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature.\nIn our experiment, we demonstrate this vulnerability by querying ChemCrow for the synthesis of nerve gas under its IUPAC name. The agent retrieves relevant information without triggering any safety mechanisms, as its safeguards do not recognize the IUPAC name as a reference to a controlled substance. This vulnerability is particularly alarming because the IUPAC name inherently includes detailed information about the compound's molecular structure and, in some cases, hints at its synthesis route.\nExacerbating risks with synthesis ingredients. The use of IUPAC nomenclature in queries introduces an additional layer of risk: the encoded chemical structure and synthesis details. For example, when queried about a compound using its IUPAC name, an agent like ChemCrow may provide not only a general description but also detailed instructions on how to synthesize the compound. This creates a dangerous feedback loop, where attackers can exploit the agent's reliance on database retrieval and its lack of cross-referencing safeguards to generate harmful outputs.\nReal-world consequences. The ability to bypass safeguards through obfuscation carries profound implications, particularly for agents interacting with laboratory environments. Agents equipped with tools to operate laboratory equipment or execute experimental protocols are acutely vulnerable. Once compromised, agents may autonomously execute or recommend protocols that produce toxic chemicals or explosives at scale. This autonomous capability significantly magnifies the potential harm, as it enables large-scale, repeatable, and undetected production of dangerous substances. Moreover, attackers could manipulate these agents to mislead well-intentioned users into unknowingly synthesizing or distributing deadly chemicals. For instance, by subtly altering a pharmaceutical synthesis protocol, an attacker can cause a user to produce and administer a lethal toxin instead of the intended drug, leading to unintended harm or mass fatalities. These risks underscore the urgent need for stronger safeguards, enhanced detection mechanisms, and continuous monitoring to prevent such malicious exploitation.\nImplications for accessibility and safety. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, exploiting these weaknesses does not require any sort of expertise in machine learning, programming, or chemistry. Anyone with access to public databases or the most basic domain knowledge can embed harmful content into innocuous documents and manipulate agents to execute dangerous protocols."}, {"title": "5. Related Work", "content": "Attacks on LLMs. The literature on LLM security vulnerabilities has grown rapidly, primarily focusing on standalone models. One popular genre of attacks is jailbreaks (Wei et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023), in which the attacker inserts a prompt into the LLM that coerces it into generating harmful text nonetheless, despite any alignment post-training or defensive system prompts. Wei et al. (2024) dissect failure modes of LLMs against attacks to guide the design of jailbreaks.\nWhile most existing demonstrations of jailbreak attacks extract information is already available on the internet, one fear is that future models more capable than those today could be persuaded to invent and output designs of new bombs or bioweapons which may not have even been present in the model's training data. Therefore, jailbreak attacks, even on standalone LLMs, are a worthwhile threat to mitigate before their potential for existential harm manifests. In this work, we will see in contrast that attacks on deployed agents can already cause widespread harm, although the harms we demonstrate may not be existential.\nIn the white box setting, Zou et al. (2023) introduce a gradient-based search algorithm which crafts adversarial suffixes that maximize the probability of generating targeted harmful text. Liu et al. (2024) further develop a more scalable algorithm for generating semantically meaningful prompts that exhibit improved transferability to closed-source models. In the black box setting, hand-crafted jailbreak prompts can be incredibly effective but are especially dangerous when paired with adversarial suffixes optimized via random search (Andriushchenko et al., 2024a). Aside from coercing models into generating harmful content, another objective of handcrafted malicious prompts is to extract sensitive training data from trained models (Nasr et al., 2023). For a categorization and benchmark of additional attacks on standalone models, see Shen et al. (2024). While these attacks probe the limitations of LLM alignment, most of them are not directly applicable to LLM agents.\nAttacks on LLM agents. A line of recent research studies vulnerabilities in LLM agents, especially in memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Several works poison databases or memory modules (Zhang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024b; Zou et al., 2024), and others trick agents into retrieving sensitive data and regurgitating it (Zeng et al., 2024). Two recent papers release platforms for testing LLM agent security (Debenedetti et al., 2024; Andriushchenko et al., 2024b).\nTaxonomy of LLM attacks. The security research community has developed taxonomies for categorizing attacks on LLMs, covering areas such as jailbreaks, prompt injection, and data poisoning (Chowdhury et al., 2024; Das et al., 2024; Shayegani et al., 2023), although distinctions between categories such as jailbreaks and prompt injection are disputed. Researchers have also explored safety taxonomies for LLM agents (Cui et al., 2024; He et al., 2024a), improving the coverage to include additional components specific to agents. While several of these works conduct experiments in simplified settings, we craft attacks against real-world agents in order to highlight that these dangers are already here, and solving them is urgent."}, {"title": "6. Discussion", "content": "We close by speculating about the future of defenses and by examining alternative views to our position."}, {"title": "6.1. Defenses", "content": "We believe that defending LLM agents will simultaneously require robust access control and authentication mechanisms, and also reliable LLMs that can reason about the context of their interactions. By verifying the legitimacy of entities interacting with the system through methods like digital credentials, we can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and mitigate the potential for malicious data extraction or system manipulation.\nBeyond systems-level guardrails, agents require reliable LLMs with context awareness. A crucial point for the community approaching this problem is that many model-based defenses designed to stave off traditional jailbreak attacks (Inan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c) will fail to defend agents. Consider as an example post-processing defenses involving an auxiliary guardian model that takes in only the main LLM's output and determines whether or not the output is harmful (Wang et al., 2024c). Such defenses are attractive because the auxiliary model does not take in the main LLM's prompt and therefore is not affected by a jailbreak prompt (unless the attacker forces the main LLM to output a jailbreak prompt for the auxiliary model). However, this defense will fail in the agentic setting because the same output may be harmless or harmful depending on the context. In our credit card information stealing illustration, divulging credit card information is perfectly acceptable when the model is shopping on trusted sites for goods that the user requested, but outputting the same credit card information is harmful when the model interacts with a scammer. Therefore, models must recognize safe and unsafe settings and react accordingly, similarly to how adept human internet users discern harmful websites or install trustworthy software while avoiding untrusted files."}, {"title": "6.2. Opposing Views: Are Attacks on Agents Really a Problem?", "content": "We identify three alternative outlooks on the security of LLM agents and discuss why we disagree.\nFirst, many believe that jailbreak attacks on standalone LLMs carry existential risk since futuristic models may be persuaded to develop new weapons that can endanger the lives of millions. In contrast, one might say that the attacks we illustrate are less severe, for example targeting credit card information. However, we argue that such attacks on agents are already a realistic threat and have the potential to severely degrade cybersecurity and information privacy infrastructure if left unchecked, as agents are increasingly incorporated into vast software. Moreover, solving both jailbreaks and agent vulnerabilities is not mutually exclusive, and solving one may help solve the other.\nSecond, some might argue that the vulnerabilities we identify are not unique to agents, but are rather inherent to LLMs themselves. For example, avoiding the disclosure of private information may also apply to the training data of LLMs. Despite such superficial similarities, the components of agentic pipelines such as databases and memory modules make privacy attacks easier. Fortunately, these components are amenable to enabling strong defenses, involving access controls or digital credentials, that are inapplicable to standalone LLMs. Moreover, the ability of agents to interact with the outside world and execute actions, for example, sending phishing emails or manipulating financial accounts, makes the potential harms of attacks far-reaching.\nFinally, others might argue that humans are also susceptible to similar threats, such as phishing attacks, and yet humans nonetheless derive utility from the internet and email despite the looming threats. Even though humans may occasionally fall prey to similar attacks, we find in our experiments that a range of simple attacks, easily recognizable by most humans, reliably deceive current LLM agents. Such attacks can easily be automated at a large scale."}, {"title": "6.3. Paths Forward", "content": "The vulnerabilities we have demonstrated in LLM-powered agents point to several critical directions for future work in both research and practice. Our findings suggest the need for immediate practical steps, longer-term research initiatives, and broader ecosystem development to address these security challenges.\nImmediate practical steps. Agent designers must implement strict controls on web access by maintaining whitelists of trusted domains rather than relying on blacklists. This approach should be coupled with robust URL validation to prevent redirect attacks, and systems should require explicit user confirmation before accessing new domains or downloading files. These controls form a first line of defense against the types of attacks demonstrated in our work.\nAgent memory systems and tool interfaces require proper isolation and authentication mechanisms. This includes implementing a separate authentication protocol for sensitive operations and maintaining careful logs of all tool usage and memory access. Regular audits of agent interactions with external systems, combined with human oversight of critical operations, can help identify and prevent potential security breaches before they occur.\nResearch directions. Future research must focus on developing context-aware security measures that can adapt to the complex nature of agent operations. We need better methods to detect contextual inconsistencies that might indicate an attack, along with"}]}

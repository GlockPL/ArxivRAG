Overall, WSNs collect and process relevant data through sensors or nodes and communicate with different networks for superior information management. Nevertheless, a primary concern relative to WSNs is security. Considering the high constraints on throughput, battery, processing power, and memory, typical security procedures present limitations for application in WSNs. This research focuses on the integration of WSNs with the cloud platform, specifically to address these security risks. The cloud platform also adopts a security-driven approach and has attracted many applications across various sectors globally. This research specifically explores how cloud computing could be exploited to impede Denial of Service attacks from endangering WSNs.\n\nWSNs are now deployed in various low-powered applications, including disaster management, homeland security, battlefield surveillance, agriculture, and the healthcare industry. WSNs are distinguished from traditional networks by the numerous wireless connected sensors being deployed to conduct an assigned task. In testing scenarios, the size of WSNs ranges from a few to several thousand. The overarching requirements of WSNs include rapid processing of collected data, low-cost installation and maintenance, and low latency in network operations. Given that a substantial amount of WSN applications are used in high-risk and volatile environments, they must effectively address security concerns. This includes the secure movement, storage, and communication of data through networks, an environment in which WSNs are notably vulnerable. The limitations of WSNs have meant that they are predominantly used in unsecured applications despite positive advancements. This study explores methods for integrating the WSN with the cloud.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly incorporated into a wide range of technological applications. Despite their utility, WSNs are vulnerable, making them a target for attacks. Early detection is critical given the distributed nature of these networks, but many vulnerabilities do not have readily available solutions [1]. The consequences for systems that provide critical services, such as utilities, transport, and communication systems, can be severe. Reduced availability, integrity, or confidentiality might severely impact victims' operations, revenue, and stakeholders' confidence. Furthermore, the frequent requirements for cost-effectiveness and power-constrained operation pragmatically impact the implementation of both security solutions and host-based remediation efforts to detect, isolate, and recover from such compromises. The result is a call for a security regime that complements the traditional network and host approaches [2][3][4]. This context motivates this research, which considers the security of WSNs from the perspective of their interactions with proposed technological solutions drawn from multiple areas. A number of solutions seek to blend WSNs with cloud solutions. Given that these solutions currently provide interface functionality such as storage, event locations, or object query repositories for WSNs, attention is turning to issues of cloud-led inter-\ndevice coordination. We postulate that for these WSN-cloud hybrids, securing the cloud component using known or emerging cloud security standards can assist in certain security tasks for WSNs. We are currently analyzing standards as a solution to enhance the security of WSNs in cloud and WSN technology couplings [5]."}, {"title": "1.1.

Overview of WSNS", "content": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are an emergent and important technology in cyberspace. There are five main properties of WSNs; distributed properties are the most critical, with these properties making WSNs unique and essential. These are the distributed, scalable, adaptable, versatile, and robust components. The sensor nodes measure and collect physical and environmental data, known as the multimedia signal, from real-time systems. The sensor nodes in a sensor network are usually energy-constrained, which limits their processing capability. The collected physical data are communicated with other sensor nodes. The nodes are usually responsible for creating sub-optimal data paths to move data through the network. The data collected by sensor nodes is passed on to a base station called the data sink.\n\nThe nodes of the sensor networks are easy to contaminate and hence may deteriorate due to adverse conditions such as compromise, loss of power, collision, and other causes. Moreover, the entities do not have a fixed network topology, a strong central processing unit, or massive hard disk, which reduces the computational power and storage of the WSN component nodes.

The number of WSN devices transmitting data in real time is so voluminous that they need to be properly extracted to avoid bottlenecks and identify the desired traffic. A continuous flow of data is both a potential hurdle and an asset. While it may increase data traffic, the availability of an IoT/WSN device location depends on the amount of data flowing in real time.

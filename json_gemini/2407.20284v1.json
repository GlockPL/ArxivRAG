Introduction", "content": "Infectious diseases [1] pose significant challenges to global health, particularly in developing countries, where they disproportionately impact populations. Countries such as India, Brazil, and several in sub-Saharan Africa [2] face high burdens of diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, and dengue fever. These diseases strain healthcare systems, impact economic productivity, and contribute to high mortality rates. In India [3], for example, the prevalence of communicable diseases remains a critical public health issue, with millions affected annually. The Indian healthcare system is often overwhelmed by the volume of patients requiring diagnosis, treatment, and management for these conditions, highlighting the urgent need for effective and scalable solutions.\nTo address these challenges, we utilize comprehensive documentation and datasets from reputable sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) [4] and the Indian healthcare system. These sources provide detailed information on various diseases, including their symptoms, transmission methods, and treatment protocols. This data is crucial for developing robust models that accurately predict disease occurrence and recommend personalized treatment plans. By leveraging this extensive documentation, our approach ensures that the disease models are grounded in the latest medical knowledge and address the specific health challenges faced by populations in India and similar regions.\nIn recent years, integrating advanced technologies like SWRL and ML has become increasingly important in healthcare. These technologies enable the development of sophisticated models that can analyze vast amounts of medical data, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights. Combining semantic technologies with ML enhances the accuracy and explainability of disease prediction models. This integration is crucial in the current healthcare landscape, where the demand for precise, personalized, and understandable health recommendations is growing. By improving disease prediction and treatment personalization, these technologies can significantly enhance patient outcomes and streamline healthcare delivery in resource-constrained settings.\nGiven the challenges discussed, we introduce a novel approach called MLtoGAI [5], which leverages SWRL for disease classification using explainable AI and ontology. The primary contributions of this paper in response to the study's objectives are:\n1. The development of a comprehensive disease Ontology. Ontologies provide structured representations of disease-specific knowledge, capturing and modeling essential concepts, relationships, and attributes relevant to various diseases.\n2. We are implementing the MLtoGAI approach for disease classification based on patient symptoms to detect multiple conditions. By incorporating SWRL reasoning, this approach improves the accuracy of disease classification by providing clear explanations for the classification rules.\n3. Utilizing explainable AI(ChatGPT) in our experiments refers to the AI system's ability to offer human-understandable explanations for its classifications using different models. By leveraging the power of explainable AI, our goal is to enhance the interpretability and reliability of the classification results by providing explanations at the user level.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews the related work. Section III describes the proposed MLtoGAI approach, including dataset description, model architecture, knowledge graph development, SWRL rules development, and ChatGPT-based suggestions."}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "This literature review examines the research on methods for classifying diseases. In recent years, increasing interest has been in utilizing AI and semantic technologies to improve disease classification and decision-making in healthcare [6]. Various studies have investigated the application of machine learning, deep learning, ontology-based approaches, rule-based reasoning [7], and the integration of explainable AI techniques [8] for disease classification. This section offers an overview of related work in the field, emphasizing their contributions and limitations. A recent survey [9] identified 966 models developed for analyzing dengue epidemics; of these models, 545 used regression methods, 220 employed temporal series analysis, 76 utilized neural networks, and 50 used decision trees to predict dengue outbreaks in tropical countries.\nRule-based reasoning has been extensively used to improve disease classification accuracy by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and logical inferences. For example, Zolhavarieh [10] proposed a rule-based method using the SWRL to classify tuberculosis cases based on clinical symptoms and diagnostic indicators. Their results showed improved accuracy compared to traditional ML algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of rule-based reasoning in disease classification. Similarly, Sandh et al. [11] introduced a framework that efficiently identifies patients with similar dengue symptoms using a domain thesaurus and case-based reasoning techniques that consider relevant keywords. Chandra et al. [7] proposed a Vector-borne Disease (VBD) ontology to aid in diagnosing and treating vector-borne diseases. This approach uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) medical data to create ontologies specifically for these diseases and employs SWRL rules for diagnosis and treatment. Similarly,\nDevi et al. [12] introduced a method that uses semantic rule-based modeling and reasoning to formalize the definition of dengue disease, focusing on operational definitions (semantics) to support clinical and diagnostic reasoning. Bensalah et al. [13] presented an approach that combines ontology and SWRL inference rules for diagnosing bone tumorsEl Massari et al. [14] demonstrated the effectiveness of combining ontology-based methods with machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(K-NN), and Decision Trees (DT) for diabetes prediction. Using SWRL reasoning and ontological models created in Protege, they enhanced classification accuracy and provided explainable AI for better interpretability. In [15], they explored the use of decision tree algorithms and SWRL rules for breast cancer detection, achieving high prediction accuracy. The study integrated ontologies with ML techniques, using Web Ontology Language (OWL), SWRL, and a reasoner to distinguish between malignant and benign cases, emphasizing explainable AI for more precise diagnostic insights.\nIntegrating explainable AI techniques has become increasingly important in healthcare to improve transparency and trust in decision-making processes. Ribeiro et al. (2016) introduced Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), a method that explains black-box ML models. LIME creates interpretable explanations by approximating the model's decision boundaries and identifying the features most significantly influencing the classification outcome. This approach has been successfully applied in various medical fields, including disease classification and risk prediction.\nIn summary, the related work on disease classification using ML and explainable AI in healthcare focuses on explaining the importance of features but needs more user-level explanations. Ontology inferencing and rule-based reasoning offer valuable insights for improving disease classification and decision-making processes but need to provide answers. Integrating explainable AI techniques enhances transparency and trust by offering human-understandable explanations for decision-making. However, while the studies discussed in Table 2 show promising results, they need to incorporate disease ontology-based reasoning for classifying dengue with user-level explainable AI. Therefore, we present MLtoGAI to explore how these techniques can be applied specifically to disease ontology development, SWRL rule reasoning, and the integration of explainable AI to provide human-understandable explanations for disease classification. This approach highlights the importance of combined features, which LIME and SHapley Addictive exPlanations (SHAP) cannot provide."}, {"title": "3.

The first dataset, \"Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset,\" contains 100 diseases with nine symptoms each. This dataset provides a basic overview of common diseases and their primary symptoms, which can be helpful in preliminary disease classification and patient profiling.\nThe second dataset, \"Disease prediction based on symptoms,\" also includes 100 diseases but extends the number of symptoms to 100. This allows for a more detailed analysis and improves the accuracy of disease prediction models. The third dataset, \"Disease and Symptoms dataset,\" comprises 41 diseases with a broader range of 394 symptoms, offering a comprehensive view of each disease's symptomatology.\nOur proposed dataset's fourth dataset significantly expands the scope, incorporating 265 diseases and 590 symptoms. The dataset contains information about these diseases and their possible symptoms, where each row represents a disease, and each column indicates whether a particular symptom is present (1) or not (0). For example, diseases like ADHD are listed with symptoms such as \"abdomen,\" \"abdominal bloating,\" and \"abdominal cramp,\" marked to show if they occur or not. This CSV file helps study the connections between diseases and their symptoms, making it useful for medical research and diagnosis.

This approach helps us improve search engines, make recommendations, and develop intelligent applications. Figure 3 illustrates the class hierarchy for disease names and symptoms. The left side shows two main categories: \"Disease_name\" and \"symptoms.\" When we click on the \"Disease_name\" category at the top, it expands to display 265 diseases, including examples like 'Common Cold,' 'Chronic Kidney Disease' and 'Chlamydia.'

In MLtoGAI, operational definitions (semantics) [25] within the knowledge base being designed include measures in the form of IF...THEN rules. These rules capture the knowledge required for diagnosis, treatment, types of clinical tests, physical symptoms, and classifying patients based on features. For instance, if an individual Ip from the patient class is diagnosed with a particular disease and exhibits a symptom X, it can be inferred that symptom X belongs to the symptom class of that disease.\nSWRL provides implication rules that enable the integration of Horn logic rules, allowing the construction of complex predicates to incorporate operational definitions (semantics) [26] of concepts in the knowledge base (Golbreich, 2004). The interpretation of a rule depends on its specific context: Production: Condition\u2192Action, General Inference: Premise\u2192Conclusion and Hypothesis: Cause Effect."}, {"title": "3.5 Chat GPT based suggestion", "content": "We used a ChatGPT [27] recommendation system in the medical field to improve patient care by giving personalized and timely health advice. This system uses advanced technology to understand patient questions, medical history, and symptoms. ChatGPT [28] can provide tailored recommendations for treatments, preventive measures, and lifestyle changes by analyzing this information, ensuring patients receive accurate and relevant information. This helps patients stay engaged with their health, supports early diagnosis, and assists healthcare providers by offering helpful insights and suggestions [5],[29]. Additionally, the system keeps learning from interactions, ensuring its recommendations stay up-to-date with the latest medical guidelines and research, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient healthcare. In Figure 7, input symptoms are provided, and ChatGPT [38] offers detailed explanations and recommendations based on those symptoms, showcasing the system's capability to deliver personalized health advice effectively.\nThe symptoms listed\u2014fever, rash, headache, ocular pain, bone pain, and arthralgia (joint pain)\u2014are commonly associated with viral infections, including dengue fever. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. It typically presents with a sudden onset of high fever, severe headaches, pain behind the eyes, and intense muscle and joint pains, sometimes called \"breakbone fever.\" The rash often appears a few days after the onset of fever, and there may also be other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and mild bleeding (such as nosebleeds or gum bleeding). It is essential to seek medical attention if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, especially if they have recently traveled to an area where dengue is common.

This split ensures that we can train the model on a large portion of the data and then test its performance on a smaller, separate set. We then apply multiple machine learning algorithms [30,31] to both the training and testing data, including Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Random Forest (RF) [32], KNN [33], SVM, DT and Logistic Regression(LR).

The user provides their symptoms, which are then preprocessed to ensure they are in a suitable format for analysis. The system generates symptoms based on the user input, which are matched using the Jaccard coefficient to identify the best matches. Co-occurring symptoms from the best matches are then selected to refine the prediction further. Next, the refined symptoms undergo prediction, where two parallel processes occur: using TF-idf with cosine similarity and an ML model. The TF-idf with cosine similarity process leverages historical medical data to find diseases with typical symptoms. At the same time, the ML model, specifically using LR, predicts the probable disease based on the final symptoms. LR was chosen for its high accuracy during testing, making it the most reliable algorithm for our purposes. Both processes contribute to identifying diseases with a Jaccard coefficient greater than 0.5, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.\nThe final step involves displaying the three most probable diseases to the user, providing clear and concise information about their potential health conditions. This comprehensive process integrates various techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of disease predictions, ultimately improving user experience and aiding in effective healthcare decision-making."}, {"title": "4. Result and Discussion", "content": "The process begins with a dataset in CSV format that includes disease names and their associated symptoms, which is used to develop an ontology.

These rules infer additional information and relationships within the data.\nUser input, typically including reported symptoms, is then processed. The system generates a list of symptoms from the input, selects the best-matching symptoms using the Jaccard coefficient, and identifies co-occurring symptoms to refine the prediction. This final set of symptoms is used to predict potential diseases using machine learning models, which also consider the user's medical history. The predictions are evaluated for accuracy and reliability using synthetic data from 200 persons to validate the model.\nBased on the evaluated results, ChatGPT provides recommendations, integrating insights from the ontology and SWRL rules to give comprehensive suggestions.

These rules can be used to make logical inferences and deductions based on existing RDF [34] data and the structure of the ontology. SWRL rules are written as logical expressions and consist of two main parts: the antecedent and the consequent. The antecedent, or \"if\" part, specifies the conditions to be met for the rule to be triggered. The resultant, or \"then\" part, outlines what actions should be taken if the conditions in the antecedent are satisfied.\nIn simpler terms, SWRL [39] lets you set up \"if-then\" rules that can automatically generate new information from your existing data. For example, you could have a rule that says, \"If a person is a parent of another person, then the first person is an ancestor of the second person.\" When this rule is applied to your data, it will automatically infer and add new ancestor relationships based on the parent relationships you already have. The figure uses a reasoner to infer new information from a patient's (patient_220) medical data. Initially, the patient's data includes various symptoms such as abnormal bleeding, prolonged symptoms, unexplained weight loss, a lump, and changes in bowel movement (step 1). \"Pellet\" is used as the reasoner (step 2).

Typically, a higher number of slots implies a more comprehensive ontology. Attribute richness (AR) refers to the average number of attributes per class and is computed by dividing the total number of attributes (att) by the number of classes (C), as shown in equation 1.\n$AR = \\frac{ATT}{|C|}$                                      (1)\nInheritance Richness (IR) evaluates the distribution of information throughout an ontology's inheritance hierarchy, reflecting how knowledge is structured into various categories and subcategories. This metric is useful for distinguishing between horizontal ontologies, which have numerous direct subclasses, and vertical ontologies, which have fewer direct subclasses. A low IR value indicates a deep and detailed ontology, whereas a high IR value suggests a broad and general ontology. IR is defined as the average number of subclasses per class and is calculated by determining the total number of subclasses for each class, as shown in equations 2 and 3.\n$H^o \\left(C_{1}, C_{i}\\right)$                        (2)\nH represent number of inheritance relationships\n$I R=\\frac{\\Sigma_{C \\in C} \\left|H^{c}\\left(C_{1}, C_{j}\\right)\\right|}{|C|}$                          (3)\nThis metric emphasizes the diversity of relationship types within an ontology. An ontology that solely contains inheritance relationships usually provides less information compared to one that includes a variety of relationship types. Relationship richness (RR) represents the proportion of non-inheritance relationships among all connections. It is determined by calculating the ratio of non-inheritance relationships (P) to the total number of relationships, which includes both inheritance (H) and non-inheritance (P) relationships, as shown in equation 4.\n$R R=\\frac{P}{|H|+|P|}$                      (4)\nThis metric indicates the average number of axioms per class.

Expanding the dataset with more diseases and symptoms from reliable sources can improve model robustness and accuracy. Developing a user-friendly interface for symptom input and accessing predictions can make the system more accessible to non-experts. Incorporating real-time data from electronic health records (EHRs) and other medical databases can keep the ontology and prediction models up-to-date. Personalizing recommendations based on patient histories and preferences can improve their relevance and effectiveness. Validating the model with real patient data in clinical settings can ensure accuracy and reliability, paving the way for practical use. Integrating data from wearable health devices can enable continuous monitoring and early detection of health issues. Implementing a Big Data framework will help manage large datasets for better visualization and analysis. Collaborating with healthcare professionals to refine SWRL rules will ensure recommendations align with clinical guidelines. Addressing these areas will enhance the accuracy, reliability, and user-friendliness of tools for disease prediction and healthcare decision-making, ultimately improving patient health outcomes."}]}

We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p < 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative Al as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases.

Introduction", "content": "Fetal and neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly valuable diagnostic tools for studying neurodevelopment during the perinatal period and play an important role in the clinical counseling of congenital and acquired diseases (Benkarim et al., 2017; Jakab et al., 2021; Lautarescu et al., 2024). Prenatal development encompasses dynamic morphological changes in the brain, which continue to evolve throughout infancy. Pathologies that form during this time can significantly disrupt brain structure and development with long term implications. Fetal and neonatal MRI allows for both qualitative and quantitative analyses to identify healthy and pathological patterns (Pfeifer et al., 2019; Sled and Nossin-Manor, 2013). Despite its potential, developing automated Artificial Intelligence (Al) pipelines for fetal and neonatal MRI analysis that improve standardization, efficiency, and reliability while minimizing human errors remains challenging, especially in pathological conditions that substantially affect brain structures. Unlike the well-established frameworks for adult MRI, progress in this domain faces challenges due to the unique and dynamic anatomy of the developing brain, data heterogeneity, limited availability of expert annotated datasets, and the low quality of acquired data (Dubois et al., 2021; Jarvis and Griffiths, 2019; Sanchez et al., 2024).\nPrior to the advent of deep learning (DL), several atlas-based methods were developed for brain tissue segmentation (Gholipour et al., 2012; Habas et al., 2010), but their applicability was restricted to normally developing fetuses. The Fetal Tissue Annotation (FeTA) MICCAI challenges (Payette et al., 2024, 2023, 2021) demonstrated that DL models can achieve robust performance in multi-label segmentation of T2-weighted (T2w) 3D super-resolution reconstructed (SR) fetal MRI. However, while these DL models perform well on healthy subjects, their performance drops when tested on diverse pathological cases, such as those with ventriculomegaly. Recent advancements, including DL-based segmentation algorithms such as BOUNTI (Uus et al., 2023) and FetalSynthSeg (Zalevskyi et al., 2024), have shown promising results in segmenting healthy fetal brain MRI but also underscore persistent challenges in handling pathological data. The available data for training image segmentation networks for the development of fetal and neonatal algorithms is limited. First, MRI annotation by manual delineation of structures requires extensive resources. Second, data availability for all developmental stages and different pathologies is limited. Third, data privacy regulations may restrict open data sharing in cases where the presence of rare pathologies might facilitate subject re-identification.\nRecent advancements in generative Al have significantly enhanced the ability to generate realistic images, with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Kazeminia et al., 2020; Skandarani et al., 2023) and diffusion models to (Croitoru et al., 2023; Kazerouni et al., 2023) being central these advancements. GANs are a class of deep learning models that generate data by training two neural networks\u2014the generator and the discriminator\u2014in an adversarial training process. GANs have shown success in creating synthetic images; however, they are prone to instability, leading to issues like mode collapse, vanishing gradients, and convergence problems. Moreover, many GAN techniques are primarily designed for two-dimensional (2D) images, which falls short of meeting the three-dimensional (3D) data needs in medical imaging (Kazeminia et al., 2020; Skandarani et al., 2023). A typical method involves generating 2D slices and stacking them to form 3D images, which can introduce spatial inconsistencies and overlook essential 3D contextual information (Jung et al., 2021).

This framework uses DDPMs (Ho et al., 2020), which applies random noise to real images (forward diffusion process) and train a DL model to iteratively reverse this noise through a reverse denoising process. In Med-DDPM the denoising is guided by conditioning the denoising step with semantic label images through channel-wise concatenation with the input image.\nWe modified Med-DDPM to accommodate four input classes (instead of 3) by adding an extra channel in the concatenation step. We altered the original hyperparameters as described in Dorjsembe et al. (2024a) to improve performance. Specifically, we increased the step size to 1000 steps (instead of 250) and set the number of epochs to 500,000 (instead of 100,000). The reasons for this was that fetuses and neonates have higher anatomical variability, compared to the more consistent adult brain structures. These adjustments enhanced network stability and improved the realistic nature of the synthetic images. During the first 100,000 epochs, a learning rate of $10^{-5}$ was used, which was subsequently decreased to $10^{-6}$ for the remaining 400,000 epochs.

Initially, each pathology had an equal probability of being simulated. Once a pathology was assigned, subsequent conditions were introduced with a 50% probability. However, cerebellum hypoplasia and pontocerebellar hypoplasia were mutually exclusive, and whenever atrophy/microcephaly was present then ventriculomegaly always co-occurred (but not the other way around) due to their frequent co-occurrence in patients with microcephaly.

In this work, we refer to dilated lateral ventricles as ventriculomegaly.\nVentriculomegaly was simulated by dilating the lateral ventricular labels. This was done both symmetrically and asymmetrically between the two cerebral hemispheres. As the FeTA2021 label images only contained 7 labels without separation between the hemispheres, we first separated the white matter and ventricles labels in the midline. This hemisphere separation was achieved using an in-house tool that is based on K-Means clustering that divides the voxel coordinates into two (L-R) clusters based on the spatial location.

Initially, the brainstem, cerebellum, and 4th ventricle labels were randomly shrunk in the x-y plane, with a maximum shrinkage of approximately 20% of the original brainstem size. The cerebellum and 4th ventricle labels were also reduced within these planes to prevent disconnection from the brainstem. As the FeTA2021 label images only include 7 labels without separation between the 4th ventricle and the lateral ventricle, the 4th ventricle was identified by performing 4-pixel dilations in the x-y direction and selecting the ventricular labels within the dilated mask. After shrinking the brainstem, cerebellum, and 4th ventricle labels in the x-y plane, the cerebellum was dilated using the same scaling factor as the shrinkage to restore its 'rounded' shape. Following this, the cerebellum label was further shrunk in all three planes (x, y, z) with the same scaling, ensuring proportional shrinkage in the z-plane as well, and shrunk around the point where the cerebellum attaches to the brainstem.

These findings support the hypothesis that synthetic pathological data can compensate for the lack of pathological representation in training datasets. A key strength of this study lies in the diversity of simulated pathologies, achieved through label modifications for conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. The pathology generator's ability to create an infinite range of clinically relevant scenarios, including co-occurring conditions, further demonstrates its versatility and potential for enhancing model training.\nAn interesting finding is the improved segmentation performance of S80-FeTA compared to R80-FeTA. This may be attributed to the better alignment of the synthetic MRI visual features (anatomical borders) with those in the annotated label images and the improved overall quality of the synthetic fetal MRIs compared to real MRIs. The higher-quality MRI-label pairs likely enabled the model to better capture the complex features and characteristics of the fetal brain, leading to more precise segmentations.

First, the training time for the Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM model was relatively long (24 days). While extended training time improved network stability and helped reduce poor-quality output, it remains a time-intensive process. Second, the quality of the synthetic data was influenced by the seed of the input noise image during inference. Different noise instances generated varied training data for the same label image, but occasionally, some outputs lacked intricate image features and were of lower quality compared to others generated from the same label image but with a different noise seed. This issue was more prominent in pathological data, likely due to the underrepresentation of pathological data in the training set. To address this, multiple noise instances can be generated, and the best output can be selected. Additionally, we extended the training duration beyond the initial recommendation to mitigate this issue. Future research could investigate whether extending training duration further reduces the occurrence of poor-quality outputs.\nFurther, we used a simplistic approach to create pathological label maps from healthy labels, which is not an accurate and comprehensive representation of the brain's anatomical changes in these conditions. For example, we dilated the ventricles, but the consequent distortion of the cortical surface (flattening of sulci) by physical forces was not modeled or simulated. We also focused on a handful of selected pathologies, which is far from the diversity that could be expected in a larger clinical center.\nThird, while there was an overall performance increase when including pathological synthetic data, for some pathological cases, performance gains was not notable, as demonstrated by the outliers in Zurich-spinabifidasevere. This may be due to the heterogeneous nature of pathologies, which affect the entire brain rather than isolated structures. For instance, in severe ventriculomegaly, the extreme dilation of the ventricles may lead to mal"}]}

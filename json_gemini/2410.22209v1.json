In recent years, grad-\nual semantics have shown great promise in extending these\nframeworks, particularly in the realm of quantitative bipo-\nlar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) (Baroni, Rago, and\nToni 2018), where arguments have weights and they include\ntwo relations of attack and support. Such bipolar approaches\nthus allow for both negative and positive, respectively, in-\nfluences between arguments to be accounted for, arguably\naligning more closely with human judgment (Polberg and\nHunter 2018). Gradual semantics have found applications\nin diverse (and often human-centric) areas, from judgmen-\ntal forecasting (Irwin, Rago, and Toni 2022) to explainable\nAI (Vassiliades, Bassiliades, and Patkos 2021; Cyras et al.\n2021; Guo et al. 2023), by allowing for quantitative, and\nthus in some cases more nuanced, evaluations of arguments\nbeyond the traditional accept/reject dichotomy. These quan-\ntitative strengths can be particularly useful in cases where\nthe information in argumentation framework is incomplete,\nsince this uncertainty can be accounted for quantitatively.\nHowever, most of the existing work on gradual semantics\n(see (Baroni, Rago, and Toni 2019) for an overview) has fo-\ncused on formalisms based on the abstract argumentation\nframework by Dung (1995), where arguments are treated\nas atomic entities without internal structure. This abstrac-\ntion, while useful in many contexts, fails to capture the rich\nlogical structure that is often present in real-world argu-\nments. Meanwhile, various forms of structured argumenta-\ntion frameworks (see (Besnard et al. 2014) for an overview),\nwhich explicitly represent the internal composition of argu-\nments and the relationships between their components, may\noffer a more expressive and realistic model in agent-based\ndomains, such as user modeling (Hadoux, Hunter, and Pol-\nberg 2023), scientific debates (Cramer and Dauphin 2020),\nand model reconciliation settings (Sreedharan, Chakraborti,\nand Kambhampati 2021; Vasileiou et al. 2024). However,\nthis greater reliance on the logical (e.g., background or\ncontextual) knowledge can lead to more problematic cases\nwhere this information is incomplete. Yet, the development\nof gradual semantics for structured argumentation has re-\nceived little attention to date.\nA notable exception is the gradual semantics proposed by\nJedwabny, Croitoru, and Bisquert (2020), which provides a\nmethod for assigning gradual evaluations to structured ar-\nguments. This approach uses T-norms and T-conorms from\nthe area of fuzzy logic to aggregate the strengths of an argu-\nment's components, offering a way to evaluate structured ar-\nguments quantitatively. However, this semantics again faces\nchallenges when dealing with incomplete information since\nit relies on an assumption of complete knowledge and pres-\nence of an argument's supporting elements. This require-\nment can limit its applicability in real-world scenarios,\nwhere such information is almost always incomplete.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce a novel\nmethodology for constructing gradual semantics for struc-\ntured argumentation frameworks that naturally accommo-\ndates incomplete information. Our approach is modular in\nthat it allows for different gradual semantics to be instan-\ntiated based on the requirements of a given task and con-\ntext. Namely, we permit arguments as chosen forms of state-\nments in statement graphs (Hecham, Bisquert, and Croitoru\n2018), consisting of a premise (a compound of literals) and"}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "a claim (a literal). Then, a core tenet of our approach is the\nselection of an existing gradual semantics for abstract ar-\ngumentation, which is used to dialectically evaluate the lit-\nerals in a premise, based on their attacking and supporting\nevidence, before these \u201cintermediate\u201d evaluations are aggre-\ngated, depending on the statement's construction, to give a\nfinal strength for the statement.\nOur methodology combines the expressiveness of struc-\ntured argumentation with the flexibility of gradual se-\nmantics, accounting for the practical reality of incomplete\nknowledge. It thus provides a novel paradigm for leverag-\ning the potential of existing gradual semantics in structured\nargumentation.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a novel methodology for constructing grad-\nual semantics in structured argumentation frameworks\nwith incomplete information, presenting two specific in-\nstantiations based on different existing gradual seman-\ntics.\n\u2022 We present a collection of novel and existing (Jedwabny,\nCroitoru, and Bisquert 2020) properties for gradual se-\nmantics in structured argumentation and discuss their\nsuitability in different settings.\n\u2022 Using these properties, we conduct a comprehensive the-\norical analysis of our two proposed instantiations, two\ndifferent instantiations of the T-norm semantics (Jed-\nwabny, Croitoru, and Bisquert 2020) and two exist-\ning gradual semantics for QBAFs, demonstrating the\nstrengths and limitations of each approach.\nStatement Graphs\nWe consider a propositional language L comprising a finite\nset of atoms, including a special atom T to represent truth. A\nliteral is an atom \u0444 or its negation \u00ac\u0444. Note that \u00ac(\u00ac\u0444) \u2261 \u0444.\nA compound is an expression constructed from literals using\nconnectives ^ and v.\nA defeasible rule r is of the form \u03a6 \u21d2 \u03a8, where \u03a6 is\na consistent compound (e.g., with no atom and its nega-\ntion) and \u03a8 is a literal. We call \u03a6 the body and \u03a8 the head\nof the rule (denoted Body(r) and Head(r), respectively).\nPragmatically, defeasible rules represent tentative informa-\ntion that may be applied if uncontested. A rule r is a fact\nrule if Body(r) = \u0422.\nA knowledge base is a tuple K = (Rf, Rn), with Rf a set\nof fact rules and Rn a set of non-fact rules.\nIn this work, we view a knowledge base K as a learned\nrepository of statements."}, {"title": "Definition 1 (Statement)", "content": "Let K = (Rf,Rn) be a knowl-\nedge base.

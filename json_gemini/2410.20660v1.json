Conditional 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional interactions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold hopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar active compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules, effectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of drug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative models is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck, we introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping model that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping with rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only enhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving up to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality compared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a powerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we further optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM), to output desirable molecules.

Recent strides in molecular design have introduced advanced generative models that excel in de-novo generation and optimization within 3D molecular space (Isert et al. [2023]). Despite these technological advances, challenges persist, such as ensuring synthesizability (Gao et al. [2021], Fialkov\u00e1 et al. [2021]) and maintaining desirable drug-like properties. The scarcity of protein-ligand complex data further complicates these demanding issues. While 1D/2D models attempt to address these challenges though various methods (Loeffler et al. [2024]), they often fall short in representing true 3D structures, and typically necessitating additional steps for proper conformation generation. On the other hand, 3D models (Ragoza et al. [2022], Luo et al. [2022], Baillif et al. [2023], Peng et al. [2022]), which directly incorporate spatial structures, show greater promise in activity prediction regarding 3D structures but are hindered by significantly slower inference speeds (Baillif et al. [2023]), which limit their practical applications such as fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (Ding and Jin [2024], Baillif et al. [2023], Wallace et al. [2023]). Recent research efforts, such as those by Lee and Cho [2024], have started fine-tuning 3D-autoregressive models with specialized reward functions to align with these stringent standards. Yet, notably absent are attempts involving Structure-Based Drug Design Diffusion Models(3D-SBDD DMs), as the prolonged inference times remain a formidable barrier, precluding the adoption of similar methodologies. In this work, we address this gap by successfully applying reinforcement learning to 3D-SBDD DMs, overcoming the challenge of prolonged inference times and demonstrating the feasibility of such approaches in practical drug design scenarios.\n3D-SBDD-DMs (Guan et al. [2023, 2024], Schneuing et al. [2022], Torge et al. [2023], Igashov et al. [2024]) exhibit powerful generative capabilities but suffer from slow processing speeds due to their reliance on iterative sampling. Addressing these speed limitations is critical for several reasons. Primarily, faster processing speeds are essential for accelerating hit discovery phases, which could significantly increase the likelihood of identifying quality hits within a shorter time period. Additionally, the high computational demands of these models not only escalate costs but also limit access to advanced optimization techniques, thereby restricting the generation of molecules with desirable properties such as synthesizability, high binding affinity, and drug-likeness. Furthermore, real-time applications, such as interactive modeling sessions with human experts, require rapid model inference to provide effective feedback and facilitate iterative testing (Sundin et al. [2022]). By enhancing the speed of these models, it may be possible to enable real-time applications, allowing for on-the-fly modifications and adaptations during interactive sessions. Addressing the speed limitations of diffusion models is thus essential to fully realize these objectives and leverage the full potential of 3D-SBDD-DMs in practical applications.\nTo address slow inference of diffusion models, various strategies have been adopted to enhance their efficiency, in the computer vision domain such as improvement of solvers, optimization of diffusion processes, and model distillation techniques (Cao et al. [2024]). The emergence of consistency models and its variants (Song and Dhariwal [2023], Ding and Jin [2024], Song et al. [2023]), heralds a rapid, efficient alternative capable of delivering high-quality results with significantly reduced computational demands. However, these acceleration attempts have been minimally explored in the context of 3D drug design.\nIn this work, we present an efficient E(3)-equivariant consistency model that combines the rapid generation capabilities of consistency models with the effectiveness of scaffold hopping (Fig. 1). To substantiate the reliability and robustness of model performance, subsequent sections will detail results and comparisons with established diffusion and consistency models. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques (Oertell et al. [2024]) to further refine our model based on objectives that are challenging to address through direct modeling alone, demonstrating its capability to surmount limitations encountered by previous 3D-SBDD models (Harris et al. [2023]).\nOur contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a target-aware equivariant consistency model tailored for scaffold-hopping, achieving speeds up to 30 times faster than traditional DDPM-based models while achieving higher drug-likeness, synthesizability, connectivity and binding affinity.\n\u2022 By leveraging faster inference speeds, we apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance binding affinity scores and reduce steric clashes without redocking in 3D-SBDD - a strategy not previously explored with diffusion models. This approach enables targeted optimizations in molecule design and opens up opportunities to tackle metrics that were previously challenging to address through direct modeling."}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 Scaffold Hopping", "content": "Scaffold hopping is a key strategy in drug discovery aimed at identifying new compounds that share biological activities but differ structurally from known molecules. This approach is crucial for enhancing drug properties and navigating intellectual property challenges. It includes techniques like heterocycle replacements, ring modifications, peptidomimetics for stability, and topology-based hopping, which innovates on molecular shape while maintaining activity (Sun et al. [2012]). Deep- learning models, particularly in topology-based hopping, explore complex molecular structures to predict novel scaffolds, driving forward drug discovery by enabling the design of therapeutics with optimized efficacy and patentability (Torge et al. [2023])."}, {"title": "2.2 Diffusion-Based Molecular Generative Models and Limitations", "content": "Diffusion-based molecular generative models (DMs) apply noise processes and their reversal to generate novel molecular structures. These range from de-novo, non-conditional molecule creation to precision drug design within protein pockets, and extend to specific tasks like scaffold hopping and linker generation (Hoogeboom et al. [2022], Vignac et al. [2023], Huang et al. [2022], Guan et al. [2023, 2024], Huang et al. [2024], Torge et al. [2023], Igashov et al. [2022]).\nDespite their broad applicability, these models encounter substantial constraints. First, the iterative reversal of noise through SDEs or ODEs often requires extensive computation, typically hundreds to thousands of iterations, resulting in slow model inference. This significantly constrains the speed at which new, active molecules can be identified, diminishing the practical efficacy of these models in time-sensitive applications (Baillif et al. [2023]). Second, diffusion models often produce molecular poses that fail to comply with key biophysical constraints, as highlighted by recent evaluations (Harris et al. [2023]). Guan et al. [2023, 2024] struggle significantly in generating biophysically realistic molecular poses. Their strain energies are notably high, with median values around 1241.7 kcal/mol and 1243.1 kcal/mol, substantially exceeding the preferable baseline of 102.5 kcal/mol from the CrossDocked dataset (Francoeur et al. [2020]). Additionally, both models exhibit considerable issues with protein clashes: Schneuing et al. [2022] shows a high rate of steric clashes with a mean score of 15.33 before redocking, and Guan et al. [2023] also has a problematic level, with a mean score of 9.08 prior to redocking. These high levels of steric clashes suggest that the molecules often have conformations that are too cramped or improperly aligned for effective protein binding, highlighting significant challenges in their ability to produce physically and biologically plausible interactions."}, {"title": "2.3 Consistency Models", "content": "Initially utilized in the vision domain, consistency models are either developed by distilling knowledge from existing diffusion models or trained as standalone entities. Defined as a distinct class of generative models (Song et al.

By directly transforming noise into data, consistency models significantly reduce generation time and offer the flexibility of multi-step sampling to improve output quality."}, {"title": "2.4 RL for Consistency Models", "content": "Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models (RLCM) is a framework that enhances the speed and efficacy of training generative models through reinforcement learning (Oertell et al.

In the molecule generation domain, to our knowledge there have been no attempts at fine-tuning diffusion or consistency models for task-specific purposes yet. By leveraging RLCM, we show promising evidence for mitigating issues in 3D-SBDD DMs (Harris et al.

[2020]), whose solution trajectories have the same marginal density at time t:\n$\\qquad \\frac{dZ}{dt} = [f(Z, t) - \\frac{1}{2}u(t)^2 \\nabla_z \\text{log } p_\\theta(Z)]dt$ (3)\nDuring training phase, Diffusion Models (DMs) learn to estimate the score, given by $\\nabla_z \\text{log } p_\\theta(Z)$ with a score model $s_\\theta(Z, t)$. Following the modifications by Karras et al. [2022], the drift term f(Z, t) is set to zero and the diffusion term is defined as $u(t) = \\sqrt{2t}$.

Using numerical ODE solvers like Euler and Heun, the model computes the trajectory {$Z_t$}$_{t \\in [0,T]}$, resulting in $\\tilde{Z}_0$ as an approximate reconstruction of the original data distribution.\nConsistency Function We develop an equivariant consistency function $f : (Z_t, t | u) \\rightarrow Z_\\epsilon$ for a solution trajectory $Z_t$ of an ODE across $t \\in [\\epsilon,T]$, where $\\epsilon$ is near zero.

Successfully achieving these conditions guarantees that each solution $Z_t$ can be traced back to its original state $Z_0$.

For TurboHopp, we also vary the number of steps in multi-step generation.\nEvaluation Metrics We evaluate sampling quality using several metrics outlined in Torge et al. [2023]. Drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility are assessed with Bickerton et al. [2012] and Ertl and Schuffenhauer [2009] respectively. Connectivity is defined as the percentage of fully connected molecules without fragments. Diversity is calculated using Tanimoto Dissimilarity, according to Alhossary et al. [2015]. Novelty is determined by the proportion of molecules that were not present in the training dataset. Additionally, we use Vina Score from QVina2 Alhossary et al. [2015] to estimate binding affinity.\nResults and Discussion Under the same context conditions, for a batch of 150 molecules, Turbo- Hopp generates on average 5-30 times faster than baseline model (Torge et al. [2023]). Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, compared to DMs, performance is superior in all metrics except diversity, which most likely falls compared to DMs due to the fact that consistency models are trained to have consistent results for data on the same trajectory. Also as total steps for multi-step generation increases, we can see an increase in diversity, due to outputs being refined less as steps decrease.\nWe applied the same score-based sampling method to the baseline model (DiffHoppscored) and compared to the model without using it (DiffHopp). All metrics rose except binding affinity. However, in DiffHopp, this method significantly reduces sampling efficiency, as it necessitates more frequent evaluations of the generated products towards the end. In contrast, TurboHopp had a major increase in all metrics with a small downside of increased generation time of only a few seconds. This is possible due to the fact that there are less steps required to generate during multi-step generation, thus less steps to evaluate afterwards.

Furthermore, for RLCM, exploring reward functions that integrate steric energies and interaction fingerprints presents a promising avenue for future research."}, {"title": "A Algorithm Pseudocode", "content": "In this section we present the pseudocode for consistency model training (Algorithm 1)", "Training\n1": "Input: dataset D = {(Zi", "0;\n2": "repeat\n3: Sample z", "1": "n4: Decompose z into x and h;\n5: Sample \u20ac~ ~ N(0", "h};\n6": "Subtract center of gravity from \u20acx;\n7: Define for \u2190 fo(v + tn ev", "h};\n8": "L(0", "fn,v);\n9": 0, "70L(0,0\u00af);\n10": 0, "\u03bc(k))0;\n11": "kk + 1;\n12: until convergence\nAlgorithm 2 Sampling with Scoring and Selection\n1: Input: Consistency model fe(\u00b7", "N-1\n2": "Sample \u20acx ~ N(0", "I)\n3": "Subtract center of gravity from Ex\n4: \u20ac \u2190 [Ex", "h": "n5: ZTE\n6: z\u2190 fo(ZT", "Tu)\n7": "Initialize max_score \u2190 18\n8: Initialize Zbest \u2190 null\n9: for n = 1 to N-1 do\n10:\nSample \u20acx ~ N(0", "I)\n11": "nSubtract center of gravity from Ex\n12:\n\u20ac \u2190 [Ex"}, {"h": "n13:\nZn2+ \u221aTn - Tn+1. \u20ac\n14:\nz\u2190 fo(Zn", "Tnu)\n15": "nif n \u2265 m then\n16:\nscore \u2190 CustomScore(z)\n17:\nif score > max_score then\n18:\nmax_score \u2190 score\n19:\nZbest \u2190 z\n20:\nend if\n21:\nend if\n22: end for\n23: output: Zbest\nAlgorithm 3 Policy Gradient Version of RLCM\n1: Input: Consistency model policy \u03c0\u03bf = fe(\u00b7", "P\n2": "for i = 1 to M do\n3:\nSample b contexts from C", "C.\n4": "nZ\u2190 P(fo, H, \u0438)\n\u25b7 where Z is the batch of"}]}

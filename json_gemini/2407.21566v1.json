INTRODUCTION", "content": "Gait recognition has played an important role within the realm of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications and smart environments. Device-free RF sensing in gait recognition has been an emerging research trend in the past years, which recognizes individuals from a distance without requiring them to perform any specific active task (e.g., fingerprint scanning [1]). Furthermore, compared to other methods, RF-based gait recognition is more promising, which does not require a direct visual line of sight of the walking person and is not affected by lighting conditions.\nEarly studies in RF-based gait recognition relied on specialized radar technology and broad-spectrum signals to analyze the way people walk. For instance, Mehmood et al. [2] used radar to measure stride rates and body segment velocities, while Wang et al. [3] applied Doppler radar to capture walking speed and step duration. Additionally, Yardibi et al. [4] developed algorithms for extracting gait features from pulse-Doppler radar spectrograms, enabling the estimation of gait velocity and stride lengths.\nRecently, leveraging CSI for gait recognition has drawn enormous research efforts, showcasing its potential in identifying individuals. WiFiU [5] utilized Wi-Fi CSI to create spectrogram-based gait features for individual classification. WiWho [6] explored step-and-walk analysis through CSI for gait identification, while WiFi-ID [7] analyzed CSI perturbations to discover unique identification features. These studies highlight the growing importance of CSI as a non-invasive tool for biometric identification in gait recognition research.\nExisting gait recognition systems face challenges with RF signal attenuation through concrete and thick walls, leading to low SNR and impairing recognition accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose the use of transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surfaces [8]. This solution allows for the precise adjustment of signal phase and amplitude through re-configurable meta-atoms, converting unfavorable propagation paths into optimal ones. This adaptive control mechanism significantly enhances transmission quality, facilitating more effective passive gait recognition.\nIn this paper, we present a transmissive RIS-aided gait recognition system, a pioneering solution capable of recognizing human identities in challenging environments characterized by concrete structures and thick walls. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We present a transmissive RIS-assisted through-wall gait recognition system, leveraging the transmissive RIS to enhance RF signal penetration through walls, thereby enabling accurate gait recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage the transmissive RIS to enable gait recognition through walls.\n\u2022 We design a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) specifically designed for gait recognition in our TRGR system, showcasing its effectiveness as the backbone network for gait recognition.\n\u2022 We implement a prototype of TRGR on a pair of transceivers and conduct experiments in real-world scenarios.

Feature Extraction and Classification", "content": "The architecture and parameters of the RCNN are presented in Table I. The RCNN is composed of several key components, including convolution blocks, batch normalization layers, ReLU layers, max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and a fully connected (FC) layer.\nThe amplitude information from CSI is input to the network and passed through a convolution block with a 3\u00d73 kernel and 2\u00d72 stride. A batch normalization layer and a ReLU layer are then applied to improve convergence. The batch normalization layer addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and improves performance [14]. The ReLU layer adds nonlinearity to increase model capacity. To extract deeper features, we design two residual blocks [15] and three convolution blocks with 16, 8, and 8 channels. Except for the last convolutional block, each convolution block is followed by a maximum pool layer [16] with a kernel of 2\u00d72 and a stride of 2\u00d72.

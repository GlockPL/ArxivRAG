We first use three mainstream machine learning classification algorithms - decision tree, random forest and XGBoost, and then output the confusion matrix of these three models. The results showed that the random forest model had the best performance in predicting the classification of heart disease, with an accuracy of 92.2%. Then, we apply the Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to the same dataset for classification experiment. The results show that the classification accuracy of the model is as high as 96.5%, 4.3 percentage points higher than that of random forest, which verifies the effectiveness of PSO in optimizing Transformer model. From the above research, we can see that particle swarm optimization significantly improves Transformer performance in heart disease prediction. Improving the ability to predict heart disease is a global priority with benefits for all humankind.

This advancement paves the way for more efficient health management and supports the foundation of a healthier, more resilient global community.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "As one of the major global health threats, heart disease has become an important cause of death. According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases cause millions of deaths every year, which not only brings a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, but also brings a huge economic burden to society and the medical system [1]. Therefore, early prediction and intervention of heart disease is particularly important. With the continuous progress of medical technology, especially in the field of data collection and information processing, the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease have gradually changed from traditional manual experience to data-driven methods, which provides new possibilities for reducing the morbidity and mortality of heart disease [2].\nThe application of machine learning algorithms has shown great potential in predicting heart disease. Traditional heart disease detection methods often rely on the subjective judgment and experience of doctors; however, this is often affected by various factors, resulting in inadequate diagnostic accuracy [3]. By analyzing large amounts of patient data, machine learning algorithms can identify underlying patterns and features to make more accurate predictions. By combining a variety of indicators related to heart disease (such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.), machine learning models can effectively assess an individual's risk of heart disease. At the same time, with the development of more complex algorithms such as deep learning, the predictive power and interpretable power of the model have also been significantly improved, allowing doctors to better understand the risk factors that lead to heart disease [4].\nMoreover, the implications of machine learning in predicting heart disease go far beyond improving the accuracy of predictions. Its efficient data processing capabilities allow doctors to obtain diagnoses faster, enabling them to formulate interventions in the shortest possible time. In addition, machine learning can also improve the performance of the model by constantly learning and updating new data, which means it is able to adapt to the changing medical environment and emerging risk factors. In conclusion, the introduction of machine learning algorithms has brought revolutionary changes to the prediction and management of heart disease, indicating great potential in the future medical field [5]."}, {"title": "II. DATA FROM DATA ANALYSIS", "content": "The data set used in this paper is an open-source data set, which contains various physiological information of patients, totaling 1888 pieces of information. Each message recorded a patient's age, sex, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood glucose, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina pectoris, peak exercise ST segment slopes, number of major vessels stained by X-ray, type of thalassemia, and final predictors (0 indicates no heart disease, 1 indicates heart disease), we selected some indicators and some data sets for display [6], as shown in Table 1."}, {"title": "III. CORRELATION ANALYSIS", "content": "Correlation analysis is used to assess the strength and direction of linear relationships between two or more variables. The most common correlation measure is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges from 1 to 1. Correlation analysis was carried out on various variables in the data, and correlation heat maps were drawn, as shown in Figure 1.\nFor the analysis of this correlation heat map, we can see that the values in the figure range from -1 to 1, indicating the strength of the correlation between different variables. The color depth of the thermal map can intuitively indicate the intensity of the correlation, and the darker the color, the stronger the correlation. As can be seen from the figure, there is a relatively strong correlation between some variables, which can be used for machine learning analysis and prediction."}, {"title": "IV. METHOD", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Related Works", "content": "In the domain of heart disease prediction,various machine learning(ML)methods have been employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.Notably,the application of Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)algorithm has demonstrated significant improvements in optimizing ML models.For instance, studies have integrated PSO with stacked sparse autoencoders to achieve a classification accuracy of 96.1%,outperforming several state-of-the-art methods [3].This approach is particularly valuable due to its efficiency in learning from limited samples,which is crucial given the complexity and cost associated with data collection in clinical settings.Furthermore,PSO has been utilized to optimize the parameters of Support Vector Machines(SVM), leading to effective performance in various classification and prediction problems, including heart disease prediction. The combination of PSO with SVM has resulted in hybrid models that outperform conventional ones,highlighting the importance of PSO in adjusting model parameters to achieve optimal results [6]."}, {"title": "B. Particle swarm optimization", "content": "Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is an optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence. PSO is inspired by the collective behavior of birds when searching for food, and its basic principle is to find the optimal solution by simulating the movement and mutual cooperation of a group of particles in the search space. These particles move through the multidimensional search space, each particle representing a potential solution, and the state of the particle is determined by two parameters: its position and velocity. The motion of particles is affected by their own historical optimal position and the historical optimal position of the whole group, thus achieving global optimization [7]. The schematic diagram of particle swarm optimization is shown in Figure 2.\nIn the PSO algorithm, a fitness function is first defined to evaluate the performance of each particle. Each particle is randomly initialized with position and velocity in the search space, and then its fitness value is calculated. As the iteration progresses, each particle gradually approaches the optimal solution by updating its own speed and position. In terms of velocity update, the current velocity of a particle is composed of three components: the current velocity, the attraction of the particle's own historical optimal location, and the attraction of the group's historical optimal location. Specifically, when updating the speed of a particle, it takes into account the best place it has been (individual experience) and the best place it has found in the entire particle population (social experience), thus guiding the search process with information from both aspects.\nIn the process of updating the motion of the particle, the position and velocity of the particle are adjusted simultaneously. The new speed is updated according to the formula to control the amplitude of movement in different directions. The formula usually contains several parameters, such as learning factor, inertia weight, etc., which can regulate the exploration and development ability of particles. The inertia weight determines the search range of the particle in the search process. The larger inertia weight is conducive to global search, while the smaller inertia weight is conducive to local optimization. By adjusting these parameters, the algorithm can effectively balance the relationship between exploring the unknown region and using the known information, so as to improve the convergence speed and search efficiency."}, {"title": "C. Transformer", "content": "Transformer is a deep learning model used to process sequential data. Different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer is completely based on self-attention mechanism and does not rely on sequential processing of sequences. It can process data in parallel and improve training efficiency, especially when processing long sequences [8]. The schematic diagram of Transformer is shown in Figure 3.\nTransformer architecture is mainly divided into Encoder and Decoder two parts. The function of the encoder is to encode the input sequence into a representation vector that contains contextual information. Each encoder layer consists of two main components: a self-attention mechanism and a fully connected feedforward neural network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically consider the effects of other words in the sequence while processing the current word, generating a weighted representation for each word by calculating the relevance of each word to the others (attention weights). Fully connected feedforward neural networks are responsible for further processing of these weighted representations. In encoders, the superposition of multiple layers can enhance the expressiveness of the model [9].\nThe structure of the decoder is similar to that of the encoder, but it requires additional consideration of the context information provided by the encoder when generating the output sequence. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder is designed to mask self-attention to ensure that only current and previous words can be considered during the generation process, and no future information can be revealed. This ensures that the generated sequence is in order. At each layer of the decoder, there are also fully connected feedforward neural networks and attentional mechanisms for the encoder output, through which the decoder is able to make full use of the context information generated by the encoder to produce a more coherent and context-relevant output.\nAnother core innovation of Transformers is Positional Encoding, since the self-attention mechanism itself does not contain positional information for the sequence. In order for the model to recognize the position information of elements in the sequence, position coding is added to the input embeddings so that the model can effectively understand the relative position relationship of individual words in the sequence. This design makes Transformer better able to handle long text, while avoiding the common gradient disappearance and explosion problems of RNN and LSTM in long sequence processing [10]."}, {"title": "D. Improved Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm", "content": "The improved Transformer model based on particle swarm optimization algorithm aims to enhance the performance of Transformer in specific tasks by using the optimization capability of PSO. In the Transformer model optimized based on PSO, PSO is mainly used to optimize Transformer hyperparameters and model structure. In this paper, PSO is used to optimize the learning rate, number of layers, hidden layer dimensions and number of attention heads of Transformer model. The first is the learning rate. Different tasks may require different learning rates, and PSO can effectively explore the optimal learning rate. The second is the number of layers and hidden layer dimensions, and the structural parameters of the model can be optimized by particles to find the best network depth and width, thereby improving the performance of the model. The last is the number of attention heads. In multi-head self-attention mechanism, optimizing the number of attention heads can better capture context information.\nIn essence, PSO treats the hyperparameters of the Transformer model as a multidimensional search space. The model first randomly initializes the particle's position (i.e. the hyperparameter combination) and velocity. These combinations are then used to train the Transformer model and evaluate its performance on specific tasks (e.g., accuracy, loss, etc.) to determine fitness values. The particle then updates its speed and position to explore more optimized hyperparameters. Through many iterations, the PSO can find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. The optimization process is shown in Figure 4."}, {"title": "V.

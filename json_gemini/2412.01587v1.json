DoH is a person's inherent\ncapability, which is affected by nature and nurture. In this\nstudy, we used dominant and non-dominant handwriting\ntraits to measure DoH for the first time, on 43 subjects of\nthree categories- Unidextrous, Partially-Unidextrous, and\nAmbidextrous. Features extracted from the segmented\nhandwriting signals called strokes were used for DoH\nquantification. Davies Bouldin Index, Multilayer\nperceptron, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nwere used for automated grading of DoH. The outcomes of\nthese methods were compared with the widely used DoH\nassessment questionnaires from Edinburgh Inventory (EI).\nThe CNN based automated grading outperformed other\ncomputational methods with an average classification\naccuracy of 95.06\u00b13.08% under stratified 10-fold cross-\nvalidation. The leave-one-subject out strategy on this CNN\nresulted in test individual's DoH score which was converted\ninto a 4-point score. Around 90% of the obtained scores\nfrom all the implemented computational methods were\nfound to be in accordance with the EI scores under 95%\nconfidence interval.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "ALTHOUGH there has been a demarcation between left-\nhanders and right-handers, humans do possess some form\nof degree of handedness. The degree of handedness is a\nmeasurement of someone's capacity to utilize one hand over the\nother, as opposed to the direction of handedness or hand\npreference. It is not a binary trait, meaning there is no clear\ndividing line between left-handedness and right-handedness.\nInstead, it is a spectrum, with some people being more strongly\nleft-handed or right-handed than others. Degree of handedness\nis one of the most interesting traits in humans which links its\nroots to many genetic and environmental factors [1] such as\nneuroanatomy [2], socio-cultural aspects [3] and preference [3].\nDegree of handedness possesses an abundance of behavioral\nand health informatics which has aided in critical assessments\nin previous works. It was investigated along with fMRI and\nEEG recordings for assessing neurodevelopmental disorders,\nlike autism [4] and dyslexia [5] (which hinder learning since\nearly age), to indicate the prevalence of mixed handedness and\npoorer language prognosis in these groups. Its association with\nspeech and language lateralization has been repeatedly\nresearched [6]. In disorders such as schizotypy and\nschizophrenia [7], it's often examined as one of the indicative\nmarkers, where a previous study found forced writing hand\nconversion to cause schizotypy [8] due to subsequent changes\nin handedness. Furthermore, in epileptic individuals, atypical\nlanguage dominance was found to increase linearly with degree\nof left-handedness [9].\nDoH and interhemispheric asymmetry can also pose grave\nchallenges in controlling brain-computer interface (BCI)\ninnovations which need brain activity for motor imagery, but a\nrecent study showed that prior knowledge of degree of\nhandedness can improve BCI performance [10]. DoH can help\ndevelop effective stroke rehabilitation techniques for dominant\nand non-dominant hand deficits [11][12].\nOther than these, degree of handedness has been investigated\nfor psychometric analyses as well. Personality assessments like\nauthoritarianism, prejudice, disgust, and seeking sensations\nwere studied using degree of handedness [13], [14]. A previous\nstudy showed traits of anxiety in consistent right-handers and\ninconsistent left-handers [15]. DoH has also been studied as a\npredictive marker of cognitive performance [16]. Nevertheless,\ndegree of handedness had been crucial in criminal investigation,\ncrimes related to handwriting forgery, feigning etc., to find the\nlevel of handedness[17].\nDespite the various and significant uses of assessing it,\ngrading instruments still rely on questionnaires and qualitative\nassessments. The past and current methods associated with\ndegree of handedness detection widely follow questionnaires\nfrom Edinburgh handedness inventory [18]. PET-based\nmeasurements [19], fMRI-based measurements [2], EEG-based\nmeasurements of cortical excitability [20], are some of the other\nmethods. The methods consisting of neuroanatomical study are\nvery expensive and time-consuming while the questionnaire-\nbased methods are quick but more qualitative than being\nquantitative. Alternatives such as peg-board test [21], a speed\ndependent motor test, may not give proper resolutions to\noutcomes in healthy persons who actively use both hands. Of\nthe many possible measurable activities such as dexterity,\nhandwriting, darts, tapping, ratchet, strength, and endurance,\nhandwriting has been considered the best method to assess DoH\n[22] for it being highly complex and elaborate fine motor skill.\nTherefore, in this study, we have proposed the use of\ndynamic kinematic features of handwriting along with its static"}, {"title": "II. METHODS", "content": "A. Participants\n\nTwenty healthy male adults (mean \u00b1 SD, age: 26 \u00b1 4.6 years,\nnine left-handed and eleven right-handed), and twenty-one\nhealthy female adults (mean \u00b1 SD, age: 25.2\u00b0 5.7 years, eleven\nleft-handed and ten right-handed) participated in this study.\nAdditionally, two ambidextrous male who identified\nthemselves as left-handed (mean \u00b1 SD, age: 27 \u00b1 1.5 years)\nparticipated in this study. These participants had no\nneurological, brain injuries, muscular injuries (including bone\nfractures and any orthopedic surgery in the past), sensory\nimpairment, or related disabilities as per their health history and\npersonal understanding. Ethical clearance for these experiments\nwas approved by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences\nethics committee (Ref. No. IEC-299/07.05.2021). Consent of\nvoluntary participation in this study was taken from each\nparticipant.\n\nB. Groups\n\nA preliminary questionnaire was prepared after studying\nOldfield Handedness Questionnaire [18], and Annett\nQuestionnaire [34]. It consisted of all 10 items of Edinburgh\nInventory [18]. This was done to assess preliminary information\nabout subject's position in between the two extreme ends of\nbeing purely \"Unidextrous\u201d or \u201cAmbidextrous\". Calculations\nof handedness score were done according to Edinburgh\nInventory. The subjects comprised many first timers who never\nwrote with their non-dominant hand, some \"in-practice\"\npersons who used their non-dominant hand for writing due to\npersonal choice, some sports people who preferred their non-\nwriting hand for playing games, some converted left-handers\nwho practiced writing with right hand and gross motor activities\nwith left hand, and ambidextrous subjects. Three groups were\nformed which were named as \u201cUnidextrous\u201d (U) consisting of\npure left handers and right handers who were first-timers,\n\"Partially-Unidextrous\" (PU) consisting of left-handers and\nright-handers who frequently trained their non-dominant hand\nwith writing activities, sports, and other chores, and\n\u201cAmbidextrous\u201d (A) consisting of two males who could write\nwith both hands with equal fluency. The group (PU) included\nactive users of non-dominant hand, whether due to sports,\npersonal preference, or conversion. The group (A) had two male\nsubjects, one (Subject ID S22) had a condition similar to\nhematidrosis, preventing him to use one hand for long hours and\nthe other (Subject ID S25) used both hands even after\nconversion. The subjects themselves identified their dominant\nand non-dominant hand as well as their respective group based\non their writing hand preference.\n\nC. Instrumentation and Data Acquisition\n\nThe experiments were conducted, and all online handwriting\ndata were captured using a commercially available digitizer\n(WACOM Pen-Tab, CTL-672) which acted as an input device,\nalso shown in Fig. 1 {a}. The spatial data (x and y coordinates)\nas well as the temporal data (time stamps) were recorded at a\nsampling rate of 134 Hz. Participants were asked to perform\ncertain writing tasks using their dominant hand with WACOM\ndigitizer, to get familiarized with the experimental setup. All\nthe tasks were performed with both hands, dominant and non-\ndominant.\n\nD. Experimental Design and Protocol\n\nThe experimental setup and protocol followed in this\nexperimental design is shown in Fig. 1 {a} and Fig. 2\nrespectively. A set of seven writing tasks of which four non-\nsensical words in cursive - \"IIIIII\", \"ellell\", \"eellee\", \"lleell\",\nthree types of symbols - \u201c\u2113 (4 loops)\u201d, \u201cinverted 000 (4\nloops)\", and \"$&&&(4 loops)\u201d were used in this experiment as\nshown in Fig. 1 {b}. Based on handwriting-based tests for\nhandedness [35], Parkinson's [27], etc. the usage of nonsensical\nwords, such as two lowercase cursive (ll)s have been found.\nThree additional nonsensical words with e's and l's were added\nto this method (both these letters have great significance in\nhandwriting based assessments done till now) in this study.\nEnglish and Hindi alphabets, circles, and spirals were\ninvestigated during preliminary evaluations. However, the\nhandwriting task analysis was limited to non-sensical phrases\nand repetitive symbols for the following reasons:\n\n1) Single-digit alphabets showed little inter-hand variability in\na statistical examination of handwriting strokes. These jobs\nwere not analyzed due to redundancy, which were bad for\ngrading.\n\n2) Drawing assignments like spirals and circles were\npurposefully excluded from study due to their difficulty even\nfor dominant hands and redundancy in features.\n\nAs per the experimental protocol the participants were made\nfamiliarized with the experiment before online handwriting\nrecording. They were asked to practice writing using digitizer\non One Note (MS Office product) with their dominant hand.\nThey were made aware of the experiment screen which\ncontained a bounding box inside which they had to record their\nhandwriting within 8 seconds from the time of initiation of\nrecording screen. Before starting each task, instructions were\ngiven in the form of visuals on the screen. Each task consisted\nof two sets, one to be performed with dominant hand and other\nto be performed with non-dominant hand, each set had 6 trials.\nIn between two trials there was a gap of 2 seconds for screen\nchange which also served as a rest time for participants to avoid\nfatigue, meanwhile the current task instruction was also\ndisplayed on the screen. Participants were instructed to follow\ntheir natural handwriting before the beginning of the\nexperiment.\n\nE.

It was observed that in any class \"U\",\n\"PU\", or \"A,\" all subjects did receive varied DB scores and\nneural network accuracies unlike Edinburgh Inventory scores\nwhich were same for many subjects under different classes.\nThis implied that the Edinburgh Inventory was only a\nsuggestive assessment of a subject's comfort at executing a job\nwith either hand, and the benefits of using computational\nmethods over questionnaire were substantial. The finding that\nsome unidextrous participants had scores (DB and NN based)\nsimilar to or overlapped with partially unidextrous, supported\nthe idea that training partly rather than solely affects capabilities\ninstilled in both hands. It further hinted that these individuals\nmay have had bi-hemispherical brain activity despite untrained\nnon-dominant hand, but this investigation could be only made\npossible by other techniques such as electroencephalography\n(EEG). It was also observed that the male and female groups\nvaried significantly (p<<0.05, Unpaired t test) in degree of\nhandedness scores graded by CNN and MLP, corroborating\npast findings showing gender-specific brain areas affect\nhandwriting and thus degree of handedness [39]. There was no\nsignificant difference observed between left handers and right\nhanders (p=0.6443, Mann Whitney U test, on MLP generated\naccuracies, and p=0.7135, Mann Whitney U test on CNN\ngenerated accuracies)."}, {"title": "Applications and future work", "content": "Degree of handedness using\nhandwriting can be considered as a"}]}

To address this concern, alongside the rising cost of medical care, the concept of \"ageing at home\" has emerged, driven by recent advances in medical and technological solutions. Smart systems and tools\u2014often leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT)\u2014are proposed to enable continuous and real-time health monitoring, assisting healthcare professionals and medical systems. Experts in computer science, communication technology, and healthcare have collaborated to develop affordable health solutions by employing sensors in living environments, wearable devices, and smartphones, in association with advanced data mining and intelligent systems with learning capabilities, to monitor, analyze, and predict the health status of elderly individuals.\nHowever, implementing intelligent healthcare systems and developing analytical techniques requires testing and evaluating algorithms on real-world data. Despite the need, there is a shortage of publicly available datasets that meet these requirements. To address this gap, we present the DAMMI dataset in this work, designed to support researchers in the field. The dataset includes daily activity data of an elderly individual collected via home-installed sensors, smartphone data, and a wristband over 146 days. It also contains daily psychological reports provided by a team of psychologists. Furthermore, the data collection spans significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, New Year's holidays, and the religious month of Ramadan, offering additional opportunities for analysis. In this paper, we outline detailed information about the data collection system, the types of data recorded, and pre-processed event logs. This dataset is intended to assist professionals in IoT and data mining in evaluating and implementing their research ideas.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The percentage of individuals aged 65 or older in 2022 was nearly 10% of the population and it is projected to increase to 16% in 2050 [1]. This demographic shift, driven by advancements in medicine and technology, presents several challenges for developed societies. These challenges include a rise in age-related diseases, further dependence on caregivers, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, and an increase in healthcare costs [2]. As people age, they are more likely to experience cognitive, mental, and physical health issues. With these difficulties that future healthcare systems have, a failure to promptly identify symptoms of age-related diseases or to continuously monitor treatment can significantly reduce the quality of life for older adults, impacting their health and ability to live independently [3], [4], [5].\nMoreover, elderly individuals often prefer to spend their later years in their own homes rather than in nursing homes, as maintaining independence contributes to a better quality of life. However, this preference increases the cost of care-giving. Consequently, the development of assistive technologies in home environments has become essential. One of these technologies that is being developed by experts in the computer and communication fields is \"Ambient Assistive Living (AAL)\". AAL creates a sensitive, adaptive, and responsive digital environment that supports the elderly in living independently. It integrates information technology, communication systems, and smart technologies into daily life, enabling older adults to remain active and autonomous for longer periods. The global AAL market is expected to reach $13.74 billion by 2027 [6].\nBy utilizing home-based technologies, like AAL, daily living patterns can be continuously monitored, enabling the detection of abnormalities that may signal the onset of physical or mental health issues, or other unpredictable situations [7]. For example, a fall can be classified as an unexpected event where an elderly person ends up on the ground [8]. In addition, intelligent systems can analyze data to detect and predict mobility, cognitive, and psychological issues. Hence, health-related data is invaluable for assessing and forecasting changes in mobility or memory, aiding in the early diagnosis of conditions such as Alzheimer's [9] and dementia [10]. Moreover, irregularities in sleep patterns, identified through smart home data, can help predict and diagnose conditions such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, stress, and even stroke[11]. Besides, in recent years, many individuals have adopted wearable fitness trackers or pedometers to monitor physical activity (PA), often in pursuit of a goal such as increasing cardiovascular strength, losing weight, or improving overall health [12].\nIn light of this promising trend, industry experts and academic researchers must prioritize the development of intelligent systems and advanced data mining techniques. These technologies are essential for collecting and analyzing data to provide affordable and efficient healthcare services. They enable personalized healthcare, allowing for treatments and services tailored to an individual's unique physical state, emotional condition, and needs. It is crucial to focus on developing intelligent, smart solutions that can scale with growing needs to prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed by increasing demands in the future.\nHowever, to ensure these intelligent systems are reliable and effective, they must be thoroughly tested and assessed. It is vital to confirm that they can perform their intended tasks accurately and consistently. These systems should evolve interactively, adapting to the needs of users and experts, and gradually integrating into people's lives while improving their functionality. Evaluating them under realistic conditions is essential to determine how well they can support healthcare professionals and facilitate timely medical interventions. Once these systems have gained the trust of both healthcare experts and the general public, they will be more readily accepted and integrated into everyday life. Therefore the first critical step in"}, {"title": "Existing IoT and smart home datasets", "content": "Creating a comprehensive dataset involves a significant amount of effort, particularly when building physical testbeds and deploying real devices for data collection. In [13], Cook et al. shared valuable insights from their experience in generating smart home datasets, highlighting the many challenges they encountered. The process is not only time-consuming but also requires careful planning, particularly in selecting appropriate sensors and ensuring the data collection is well-planned. It is often recommended that such efforts be carried out in multiple phases to ensure quality and address potential issues as they arise [14].\nDue to these challenges, the number of available datasets is still quite limited. Many are either not publicly accessible or involve data collected over short periods or in controlled, laboratory settings. Despite these constraints, several valuable efforts have been made to gather and share datasets that help advance research in this field. These datasets are instrumental for researchers and developers seeking to improve smart healthcare solutions and IoT-based systems."}, {"title": "The Detailed description of the dataset", "content": "The dataset proposed in this study is collected by an IoT system and contains data from a smart home equipped with ambient sensors, wristband data and smartphone information on the usage of mobile applications. In addition, daily psychological reports are also collected and provided. All of the data modalities are gathered for a period of 146 days in the timeframe between 09/01/2020 and 02/06/2020 from a 60-year-old female subject.\nDuring the collection period, multiple exciting events happened that influenced the behavior of the resident and possibly led to higher variability and complexity in the collected data. There was heavy snow on the 35th day from the beginning of the collection process, due to which the electricity was cut off for several hours. This event also changed the habit of the subject for a few days. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic and a lockdown period from the 40th day in the region affects the habits of the participant. From the 109th day to the 137th day was the Ramadan month; therefore, the resident changed her habits such as meal times, praying time and duration, and sleeping intervals.\nIn the following more details on the raw data sources and pre-processed extracted event logs are described in detail."}, {"title": "Data sources", "content": "For data collection, we took advantage of multiple sensor devices together to collect data simultaneously. These different data modalities are selected to capture a more comprehensive view of the user and provide us with a multi-perspective view of daily life."}, {"title": "Ambient Sensors", "content": "These sensors installed in the house are used to perceive the environment and the activities performed by the resident during the day. The installed devices are 15 binary sensors positioned on furnishing elements, appliances, and doors. Indeed, the ambient sensorial information includes readings from multiple PIR sensors showing the presence of the subject in different areas of the solo-resident house, a power usage sensor indicating TV usage, contact sensors highlighting the opening and closing of the Bathroom, WC and closet doors and a gas detection sensor detecting cooking activity."}, {"title": "Wearable sensor data", "content": "A Xiaomi Mi Band-3 wristband was used to provide information about daily activity time, walking steps and distance, calories burned and sleep-related data such as night sleep time, duration and quality (deep/light sleep or awake time durations)."}, {"title": "Mobile data", "content": "With the aid of a mobile application, smartphone usage information is collected.

The team of psychologists proposed a new questionnaire for the psychological-based labelling process, suitable to the experiment scenario and its limitations. This questionnaire is designed according to the well-known standard questionnaires in the literature including\n- The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28),\nBeck Depression Inventory, and\n- PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index)\nA psychologist checked the psychological status of the person on a daily basis, and then a team containing three different psychologists answered a predetermined questionnaire with 39 items in seven categories by considering the information from the home visit observation and interaction with the subject as well as the insight provided by the smart facilities. Each question had three options, high (score of three), average (score of two), and low (score of one)."}, {"title": "Preprocessed Event Logs", "content": ""}, {"title": "The location event log", "content": "Using ambient sensor data, we have conducted a pre-processing phase to extract the person's presence in different areas of the house. As illustrated in Figure 1, the sensors are installed in six different areas of a house. To discover the exact location of the resident in different areas of the home by using ambient sensorial information, we can look at the locations in which sensors are mounted, and use the timestamp of captured events' to infer the person's location at different times.\nFor instance, an event captured by the bedroom's closet sensor means that the subject is in the bedroom at that time. Then, by co-relating each sensor to its installation location, every captured event could be mapped to a location. Therefore, if we have the whole sequence of captured events for some time, then, the person's presence in different areas of the house and even the sequence of his/her movements could be inferred.\nThus, the house is partitioned into seven different areas and a set of simple rules are used over the events generated by the PIR and contact sensors to discover the subject's presence in these areas. The timestamp of first captured event and the last event in each area are then considered for determining the events' start and end time and the following labels are assigned to the discovered events at each place; Kitchen, LivingRoom, Bedroom, Corridor, WC, Bathroom and Entrance. Figure 3 presents a part of ambient location event log. This event log includes 12494 records for the whole period of data collection and can be used in studying mobility patterns, behaviour analysis, behaviour anomaly detection and so on."}, {"title": "Activity and location event log", "content": "In addition to the location events, since some sensors (such as the TV sensor, kitchen appliance sensors, etc.) are just triggered when the subject performs specific activities, hence, besides finding the location of the subject, the sensor readings can also be used to discover the incidence time and duration of those activities. These activities, which are performed by using specific instruments, are known as instrumented Activity Daily Livings (iADL) and are investigated in several studies and projects.\nUsing the sensor readings, we have detected the discoverable activities for the whole dataset period. These activities are Sleeping, Praying, Sitting, Sitting and Watching TV, Eating, Eating and Watching TV, Cooking, Using Telephone and Chores. The activity and location event log includes 18427 records a part of it is represented in Figure 4. The activity and location event log can be used for research purposes like evaluation of ADL discovery methods, activity pattern recognition and detection of changes in daily routines."}, {"title": "Wristband event log", "content": "The wristband event log contains daily information collected by the wristband including the daily steps, distance, activity time, start sleep time and wake up time for sleeps during night and afternoon, the amount of deep and light sleep.

To understand the possible changes in the behaviour caused by these events, it is important to know the exact time of each event. Therefore, we have provided a file with complete information about each day such as being weekday or weekend, relation to the pandemic or Ramadan periods, weather and so on. A piece of this file is presented in Figure 6. This part of dataset can be used for cross-validation of the analysis based on dataset data and evet logs and helps to acquire more knowledge about the context."}, {"title": "Merged Activity and Event Log from all modalities", "content": "Considering all data sources and extracted events, this event log is created by merging and cross validating the events from all modalities. For instance, the sleep events detected by ambient sensors and wristband are cross-checked together and then using mobile event log, the awake times are identified and subtracted from the whole sleep duration. In this way, the activity and location events are created in a more accurate and multi-modal. Figure 7 shows an snapshot of this event log which includes 33848 records."}, {"title": "Non-overlapping activity and location event logs", "content": "The activities, which are executed in parallel leads to additional possibilities in data mining and increased the analysis complexity. For instance, a person can use the smartphone and watch TV at the same time or use the phone during mealtime. In the non-overlapping activity and location event log, new labels generated by concatenating the labels of activity or events, which are happened in parallel, and the event log includes event records, which do not have any overlap. This event log are created in two version, one without considering the cooking activity overlaps (overlap of cooking activities are remained) (Figure 8) and the second one which removed the cooking activity overlaps as well (Figure 9).\nThe non-overlapping activity and location event logs with cooking overlaps contains 50368 records and the event log after removing cooking overlaps includes 50631 record."}, {"title": "Distinctive Features of the Dataset", "content": "Compared to other datasets, our dataset offers several distinct advantages. First, it provides multimodality, integrating data from multiple devices such as ambient sensors, smartphone, and a wearable device, which allows for a more comprehensive analysis by combining information from different sources. Second, the data collection spans approximately five months, offering a longer observation period that captures significant behavioral variations over time. This extended timeframe is crucial for identifying patterns and trends that shorter datasets might miss. Additionally, our dataset covers key events known to disrupt daily routines, such as the COVID-19 pandemic with its lockdown period, New Year's holidays, and the month of Ramadan. These events introduce significant lifestyle changes, making the dataset particularly valuable for studying behavioral shifts and deviations during such times. Finally, the daily psychological reports, that are collected by a psychologist and provided beside the sensorial data, offer unique insights into the emotional and mental state of the subject, allowing researchers to explore the potential link between mood, activities, and environmental factors.\nThe dataset presented in this work is available for research purposes to help future advancements in smart healthcare and IoT-based systems and we invite researchers and professionals from relevant fields to use this resource in their own studies."}]}

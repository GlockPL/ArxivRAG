Data must be partitioned and distributed across multiple cloud platforms according to specific strategies, as shown in"}, {"title": "3.2. Cross-Cloud Communication Optimization Techniques", "content": "In cross-cloud federated training, communication efficiency is one of the key factors determining training speed and overall system performance[15-16]. Since model parameters and data must be frequently exchanged between multiple cloud platforms, optimizing cross-cloud communication becomes a critical technical challenge to improving training efficiency. Communication bottlenecks can lead to increased latency and bandwidth usage, which affect model synchronization and update speed[20]. Therefore, the goal of cross-cloud communication optimization is to reduce the amount of data transmitted, minimize network latency, and improve bandwidth utilization to ensure the smooth operation of the training process. First, reducing communication frequency and the amount of data transmitted is one of the primary strategies for optimizing communication. Compressing or sparsifying model parameters can significantly reduce the volume of data that needs to be transmitted, thus lowering communication overhead. For example, using gradient compression techniques, only the model parameters with significant changes are transmitted during training, reducing unnecessary data exchange. In addition, a local update strategy allows cloud platforms to perform multiple rounds of local model updates without global synchronization after each iteration, effectively reducing the number of cross-cloud communications and improving overall efficiency[17-18]. Second, utilizing efficient communication protocols can further optimize cross-cloud communication performance. Traditional protocols like TCP/IP are widely used in network transmission but may not always be ideal in scenarios involving high-frequency, large-scale data transmission. Therefore, protocols specifically designed for distributed computing, such as gRPC or QUIC, can better handle high-latency, low-bandwidth network environments, improving cross-cloud transmission efficiency[19-20]. Moreover, multiplexing techniques can fully utilize network resources, reducing the risk of congestion on a single connection and further enhancing communication performance. Finally, asynchronous communication is another key technique for optimizing cross-cloud communication. In synchronous communication, all cloud platforms must exchange data and synchronize models simultaneously, which can cause network congestion and delays in the training process. Asynchronous communication allows cloud platforms to transmit data and update models at different times, easing network pressure and improving resource utilization across platforms[21-22]. While asynchronous modes may cause fluctuations in model convergence speed, adjusting update frequencies and communication parameters can strike an optimal balance between model accuracy and communication efficiency. In summary, cross-cloud communication optimization techniques, by reducing data transmission, adopting efficient communication protocols, and introducing asynchronous communication mechanisms, provide essential technical support for cross-cloud federated training[23-24]. As cloud computing and network transmission technologies continue to advance, these optimization techniques will further enhance the efficiency and scalability of cross-cloud federated training, enabling more effective and stable training of large language models across multiple cloud platforms[25-26]."}, {"title": "3.3. Model Aggregation Algorithms and Optimization", "content": "In cross-cloud federated training, the model aggregation algorithm is a critical component that ensures the integration of sub-models trained on each cloud platform into a global model[28]. Since each cloud platform uses different local datasets during training, the challenge is to effectively aggregate these sub-models while preserving individual learning outcomes and improving the accuracy and generalization of the global model[27-28]. The optimization of model aggregation not only affects"}, {"title": "", "content": "the speed of model convergence but also determines the overall efficiency and performance of the training process[29-30]. The Federated Averaging Algorithm (FedAvg) is the most commonly used model aggregation algorithm in cross-cloud federated training[31-32]. The core idea of FedAvg is to perform a weighted average of the local models from each cloud platform to obtain the global model[33-34]. Let w\u2081 represent the local model parameters for each cloud platform, then the global model parameters w can be expressed as formula 1:\n\\[W = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{n_i}{n} W_i\\]\nWhere N is the total number of cloud platforms, n\u2081 represents the number of data samples used by the i-th cloud platform, and n is the total number of data samples used by all platforms. Through this weighted averaging method, FedAvg ensures that the contribution of each local model to the global model is proportional to its sample size, thereby avoiding bias caused by uneven data distribution. However, FedAvg has some limitations in practice. First, when data distribution across cloud platforms varies significantly, simple weighted averaging may slow down global model convergence or even reduce accuracy. Second, FedAvg's synchronization mechanism requires all cloud platforms to complete training and synchronize updates simultaneously, which can increase communication overhead and delay the training process in a cross-cloud environment[35-36]. To optimize FedAvg's shortcomings, a dynamic weighted aggregation strategy can be introduced. This strategy dynamically adjusts the weight of each cloud platform's model in the global model based on model performance and data distribution. Let the loss function of the i-th cloud platform in the current iteration be Li, then the dynamic weight \u03b1 can be expressed as formula 2:\n\\[\\alpha_i = \\frac{e^{-L_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{-L_j}}\\]\nThis method assigns higher weights to cloud platforms with more accurate models, thus increasing their contribution to the global model. This dynamic weighting approach effectively mitigates the bias caused by uneven data distribution, improving the convergence speed and performance of the global model. Another optimization method is gradient-based aggregation. Instead of parameter aggregation, gradient aggregation directly aggregates the gradients from each cloud platform to update the global model parameters. Let \u2207w; represent the gradient from the i -th cloud platform, then the global model update can be expressed as formula 3:\n\\[w^{t+1} = w^{t} - \\eta \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{n_i}{n} \\nabla w_i\\]\nWhere n is the learning rate and t represents the current iteration. By aggregating gradient information directly, gradient aggregation captures parameter changes more quickly. In a cross-cloud environment, where local data exhibits heterogeneity, gradient aggregation helps improve the generalization ability of the global model. To reduce the latency and overhead of synchronous communication, asynchronous model aggregation algorithms can be adopted[34]. In the asynchronous mode, each cloud platform does not need to update the model at the same time, but can update asynchronously according to local computational capabilities and training progress. Let the global model parameters be wand the local model parameters of the i-th cloud platform be wi, then asynchronous model aggregation can be expressed as formula 4:\n\\[w^{t+1} = w^{t} + \\alpha_i (w^i - w^t)\\]\nWhere \u03b1 is the asynchronous update weight. Asynchronous model aggregation effectively reduces communication overhead across cloud platforms while improving the utilization of computational resources on each platform. To validate the performance of different aggregation algorithms, experiments can compare synchronous vs. asynchronous and parameter vs. gradient aggregation methods. Experimental results show that dynamic weighted aggregation significantly improves global model convergence speed and accuracy in cases of uneven data distribution. Asynchronous aggregation reduces communication latency while maintaining high model accuracy, while gradient-based aggregation demonstrates better generalization in heterogeneous data scenarios[37-38].In conclusion, optimizing model aggregation algorithms is a crucial step in improving the performance and training efficiency of cross-cloud federated training. By introducing dynamic weighting, gradient aggregation, and asynchronous updates, more efficient training processes and more accurate model results can be achieved in complex cross-cloud environments[39-40]."}, {"title": "4.

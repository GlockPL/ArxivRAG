While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) introduce dynamic weighting mechanisms that can mitigate oversmoothing to some extent, they can also contribute to it under certain conditions Velickovic et al.

To fully understand and address this phenomenon, we adopt a dynamical systems perspective Roth and Liebig [2024].\nUnlike traditional approaches that focus on architectural modifications, the dynamical systems view provides a more fundamental explanation by examining the stability and convergence properties of GNNs. By modeling GATs as dynamical systems, we can analyze how node representations evolve across layers and identify the conditions under which oversmoothing occurs Wu et al. [2024], Di Giovanni et al.

This dynamic weighting introduces complexity into the system's behavior, making it essential to understand how these weights evolve across layers. The attention mechanism can be seen as a time-varying update function:\n$f(x(t)) = \\sigma \\Big(\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} a_{ij}(t)Wx_j(t)\\Big)$"}, {"title": "Theoretical Analysis of Oversmoothing in GATs", "content": "In this subsection, we rigorously analyze the phenomenon of oversmoothing in GATs using dynamical systems theory. Specifically, we explore the existence of fixed points, their stability, and the conditions under which node representations converge to indistinguishable states. The detailed theoretical proofs are given in the Supplementary Section\nLemma 1. (Existence of Fixed Points in GATs). Consider a GAT with an update rule $f : \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$, where $X(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ represents the node features at layer t. The update rule for the node features can be expressed as:\n$X_i(t + 1) =  f(x(t)) = \\sigma \\Big(\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} a_{ij}(t)WX_j(t)\\Big)$\nwhere o is a nonlinear activation function, W is a weight matrix, and $x_{ij}(t)$ are the attention coefficients at layer t for node i and its neighbor j.\nIf the spectral radius $\\rho(A_{eff}(t)) < 1$, the system will converge to a fixed point $X^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ such that $X^* = f(X^*)$, indicating that node features become stable and indistinguishable, leading to oversmoothing.\nLemma 2. (Oversmoothing as Convergence to an Attractor in GATs). Let $X(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ represent the node features at layer t in a GAT. The evolution of the node features is governed by the update rule:\n$X_i(t + 1) = f(X_i(t)) = \\sigma \\Big(\\sum_{j \\in N(i)} a_{ij}(t)WX_j(t)\\Big)$\nAssume that the update function f is a contraction mapping, i.e., there exists a constant $c \\in [0,1)$ such that for all $X_1, X_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$,\n$||f(X_1) - f(X_2)|| \\leq c||X_1 - X_2||$.\nThen, there exists an attractor $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ such that:\n$\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} X(t) \\in A,$\nwhere A is a low-dimensional subspace in which node features become indistinguishable.\nLemma 3. (Stability of Fixed Points in GATs). For a GAT with an update rule $f : \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$, let $X^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ be a fixed point of f, i.e., $f(X^*) = X^*$. The fixed point $X^*$ corresponds to oversmooth-ing if $\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} ||X_i - X_j|| = 0$ for all i, j. The fixed point $X^*$ is stable if and only if the spectral radius $\\rho(J_f(X^*)) \\leq 1$."}, {"title": "DYNAMO-GAT Algorithm", "content": "The DYNAMO-GAT algorithm is a novel approach designed to address the oversmoothing problem in attention-based GNNs. It counters this by selectively pruning attention weights using a combination of noise injection, covariance analysis, Anti-Hebbian principles, dynamic thresholding, gradual pruning, and layer-wise pruning rates. The DYNAMO-GAT algorithm 1 introduces non-linear perturbations into the system's state (node features) and modifies the connectivity structure (attention weights) dynamically. This not only disrupts the undesired fixed points associated with oversmoothing but also introduces mechanisms that ensure the system explores a richer set of node representations, maintaining diversity across layers."}, {"title": "Covariance Matrix and Noise Injection", "content": "The first step in the DYNAMO-GAT algorithm involves injecting independent Gaussian noise into the node features at each layer:\n$h^{(l)} = h^{(l)} + \\sigma\\epsilon,$\nwhere $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, I)$ represents Gaussian white noise with a standard deviation $\\sigma$. This noise perturbs the system state, revealing the underlying correlations between node features through their covariance structure. The covariance matrix $C^{(l)}$ is then computed as:\n$C_{ij}^{(l)} = Cov(h_i^{(l)}, h_j^{(l)}) = E [(h_i^{(l)} - E[h_i^{(l)}]) (h_j^{(l)} - E[h_j^{(l)}])]$.\nThis matrix captures the pairwise correlations between node features, which are crucial in identifying which connections (attention weights) contribute to oversmoothing. Nodes with highly correlated features are likely to converge towards similar representations. The covariance matrix measures the system's state coherence. High coherence (correlation) across many node pairs indicates a drift towards a stable, but undesirable, fixed point where oversmoothing dominates. By analyzing these correlations, DYNAMO-GAT can selectively target and prune connections that reinforce this drift, thereby altering the trajectory of the system's evolution."}, {"title": "Anti-Hebbian Pruning Criterion", "content": "The pruning strategy in DYNAMO-GAT is grounded in the Anti-Hebbian principle, which dictates that connections between highly correlated nodes should be weakened or eliminated. Taking inspiration from recent works on using noise to prune Moore and Chaudhuri [2020], Chakraborty et al. [2024], this principle computes the pruning probability $p_{ij}^{(l)}$, which is dynamically adjusted based on a threshold (t) that adapts to the distribution of edge weights. The dynamic pruning threshold (t) is defined as:\n$\\tau(t) = \\mu(|W_{ij}|) + \\beta \\cdot \\sigma(|W_{ij}|),$\nwhere $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ represent the mean and standard deviation of the edge weights, respectively. This threshold ensures that the pruning process is sensitive to the distribution of edge weights, allowing for more adaptive and context-sensitive pruning. The pruning probability is then computed as:\n$p_{ij}^{(l)} = r(t) \\cdot \\Big(\\frac{a(C_{ii} + C_{jj} - 2C_{ij})}{\\tau(t)} + \\frac{C_{ii} + C_{jj}}{2C_{ij}}\\Big),$\nwhere r(t) is the layer-wise pruning rate defined as $r(t) = r_0 \\cdot (1 + \\gamma t)$. This scales with the depth of the layer, allowing for more aggressive pruning in later layers where oversmoothing is more likely to occur.\nThe pruning probability $p_{ij}^{(l)}$ acts as a control mechanism that adjusts the strength and structure of the network's connections in response to the current state (as reflected by the covariance matrix). By dynamically adapting to the network's evolving state, DYNAMO-GAT effectively steers the system away from regions of the state space associated with oversmoothing, thus maintaining a more robust and diverse set of node representations."}, {"title": "Gradual Pruning Process and Update Rule", "content": "DYNAMO-GAT employs a gradual pruning approach, where edge weights are progressively reduced based on the computed pruning probability, rather than being immediately set to zero. This is given by:\n$W_{ij}(t + 1) = W_{ij}(t) \\cdot (1 - p_{ij}^{(l)})$.\nAn edge is fully pruned (i.e., its weight is set to zero) only if $w_{ij}(t + 1)$ falls below a small threshold $\\epsilon$.\nThe gradual pruning process introduces continuity into the network's dynamics, allowing the system to smoothly transition from one state to another. This contrasts with abrupt changes that could destabilize the learning process. The gradual reduction of weights effectively modifies the original update rule F to a pruned update rule $F_p$, which can be expressed as:\n$h^{(l+1)} = F_p(h^{(l)}, a^{(l)}, W^{(l)}, C^{(l)})$,        (6)\nwhere $F_p$ incorporates the cumulative effects of pruning across layers. This gradual pruning can be seen as a form of perturbative adjustment, where the system is continuously nudged towards a more favorable configuration. The incremental changes introduced by gradual pruning helps the system avoid large, disruptive shifts that could lead to suboptimal convergence or loss of critical information."}, {"title": "Recalibration of Attention Weights", "content": "Once pruning has been applied, it is essential to recalibrate the remaining attention weights to ensure effective information propagation within the network. This recalibration process re-normalizes the attention coefficients $a_{ij}^{(l)}$ among the surviving connections:\n$\\alpha_{ij}^{(l, recal)} = \\frac{a_{ij}^{(l)}}{\\sum_{k \\in N(i)\\setminus Pruned(i)} a_{ik}^{(l)}}$,\nwhere Pruned(i) denotes the set of pruned edges for node i. Recalibration ensures that the information flow in the network remains balanced despite the reduced number of connections. This step is crucial for maintaining the stability of the network's dynamics post-pruning, as it prevents any remaining connections from becoming disproportionately influential, which could lead to oversmoothing."}, {"title": "Theoretical Results", "content": "Leveraging noise-driven covariance analysis, DYNAMO-GAT introduces stochasticity into the system, preventing the network from settling into fixed points prematurely. This stochasticity is particularly important in deeper networks, where oversmoothing is more likely to occur. The selective pruning mechanism further refines the system's dynamics, ensuring that only the most relevant connections are maintained, which aligns with the goal of avoiding low-dimensional attractors.\nLemma 4. Let G = (V,E) be a graph and F : $R^{n\\times d}$ $\\rightarrow$ $R^{n\\times d}$ be the function representing the GNN layer transformation, where n = |V| and d is the feature dimension. Let Fp : $R^{n\\times d}$ $\\rightarrow$ $R^{n\\times d}$ be the function representing the DYNAMO-GAT pruned GNN layer transformation. Denote by $X^*$ $ \\in R^{n\\times d}$ the oversmoothing fixed point such that F($X^*$) = $X^*$. Let JF($X^*$) $ \\in$ $R^{nd\\times nd}$ and JFP($X^*$) $ \\in$ $R^{nd\\times nd}$ be the Jacobian matrices of F and Fp respectively, evaluated at $X^*$. Then:\n$\\rho(JF_p (X^*)) < \\rho(JF(X^*))$\nwhere $\\rho()$ denotes the spectral radius of a matrix. Consequently, DYNAMO-GAT pruning reduces the stability of the oversmoothing fixed point by decreasing the spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix of the pruned GNN.\nLemma 5. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n = |V| nodes, and let X(t) $\\in$ R^{n*d} be the matrix of node feature vectors at layer t in a GNN. Define the covariance matrix C(t) $\\in$ $R^{d*d}$ of the node feature vectors at layer t as:\nC(t) =  $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}X(t) X(t)^T - \\frac{1}{n^2} (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X(t)^T 1_n 1_n X(t))$\nwhere 1n $\\in$ $R^n$ is the vector of all ones. Then, DYNAMO-GAT algorithm ensures that:\nrank(C(t)) = d, $\\forall$t $\\in$ {0,1,...,T}\nwhere T is the total number of layers in the GNN.

Moreover, while attention mechanisms in GNNs, such as those used in GATs, have improved the focus on relevant parts of the graph, they remain vulnerable to oversmoothing without proper regulation [Wu et al., 2023", "2020": "."}]}

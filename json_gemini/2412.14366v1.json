For example, OpenAI's DALL\u00b7E [1] is a generative model that produces high-quality images from textual\ndescriptions (i.e. prompts). As technology develops, more and more tools are available. DreamStudio [2], Deep Dream\nGenerator [3], MidJourney [4], and various other models are getting more and more powerful in this domain. These\nmodels typically require users to input text, in the form of words or longer sentences, to generate images. Alternatively,\nsome models can also take a base image along with the text input to facilitate the generation process. Such progress\nshows a tendency towards realism, rather than enhancing flexibility and novelty in artistic expression. Some tools make\nit possible to create some diverse and realistic visuals (e.g. using Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [5]), but at\ntimes, the generated objects in these images can exhibit a lack of logical coherence, both in their selection and how\nthey are combined or the style of assemblage. However, this feature can serve as a valuable source of inspiration for\nartists [6, 7].\nSurrealism was an artistic movement that gained popularity between WWI and WWII. It emerged as an influential\nartistic movement following advances in modern psychology, especially influenced by the work on unconscious by\nSigmund Freud [6]. The Surrealists sought to harness the creativity of the unconscious mind. Some of the previous\nstudies claim that these generative models can be considered getting better at generating art that emulates surrealism\nand fantasy [7]. However, this claim was not justified with experimental evaluation. The generated images can exhibit\ncreative potential in unconventional arrangements by being used as a basis for supernatural imagery or potential ideas\nto have objects juxtaposed (placing different things side by side for contrasting effect) [8]. Our cursory examination"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "Artistic Image Generation", "content": "Image generation has witnessed some remarkable progress due to the availability of a large number of datasets and\nthe advances of various large-scale generative AI methods. Among the leading tools in this field are DALL-E [1],\nMidjourney [4], and Stable Diffusion [14]. DALL-E has a simple interface and it is a text-to-image model [15]. In\ncomparison, Midjourney is more complex and requires its users to use a specified platform (without an API). The\nstable diffusion model which we use is DreamStudio and can be hit or a miss with the generation depending on the\nversion [15]. These tools use various generative AI techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [5],\nTransformers [16], and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [17] for the generation of images.\nAs for evaluation, the Inception Score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) are algorithms used to assess the perfor-\nmance of generative image models. The FID score evaluates the quality and diversity of generated images by comparing\ntheir distribution with real images. It quantifies the dissimilarity between the feature representations of these two\ndistributions [18]. The Inception Score, conversely, focuses on assessing the recognizability of objects within the\ngenerated images [19]. Both algorithms provide valuable insights into the capabilities of generative image models.\nAnother approach involves human evaluation, incorporating data and results that rely on human perception and\nunderstanding. However, it is important to note that the methods used for human evaluation metrics can vary among\nresearchers.

Since\nthe personal information of the participants was anonymized, the authors did not track the exact affiliation of each.\nThe questionnaire is divided into three parts, each corresponding to the image generation as described in the previous\nsubsection.\nIn Part 1 of the survey, we conduct a comparative analysis of multiple generative models and settings.

PS2: Given the PS1 and a description request,\nChatGPT generates prompts with a word limit of 15. For instance, the input \"The description of a surrealistic-like\npainting with 1 person, 2 dogs in 15 words\" is used to generate images. PS3: Given the PS1 and a 15-word request for a\ndescription, along with the name of an artist, ChatGPT generates a prompt for image generation. For instance, the input\n\"The description of a surrealistic-like painting with 1 person, 2 dogs in 15 words, Gari Melchers\" is used to generate\nimages. PS4: Similar to PS2 but with a 50-word request for a description. For instance, the input \"The description of a\nsurrealistic-like painting with 1 person, 2 dogs in 50 words\" is used to generate images. PIS5: Similar to PS4 but with\nthe base image also as input. Additionally, the base image will be downscaled to its 1/4 size. PIS6: Similar to PS4 but\nwith the base image also as input. Additionally, the base image will be blurred (Gaussian blur) by using the Python\nImaging Library (PIL).\nTable 2 presents various sections of the survey, denoted as P1, P2, and P3, along with distinct sub-questions labeled\nSQA, SQB, and SQC. During our analysis of the responses to these sub-questions, we segregate the survey parts due to\ntheir specific content. In Part 1 and 2, all three models are featured, whereas Part 3 is exclusively about DreamStudio\nand Deep Dream Generator. It is evident that, concerning DALL-E, sub-questions SQA and SQB are the most frequently\nselected, while for DreamStudio, sub-question SQC is favored. Similarly, for Deep Dream Generator, sub-question\nSQC emerges as the predominant choice among participants.\nFigure 3a shows the distribution of participants' answers for all the model settings. For the DALL-E PS1, the median\ncount of participants' answers is 4.50. In contrast, the Deep Dream Generator PS1 shows a higher median count of\n13.50. For the DreamStudio PS1, the median count is 1.00, indicating that it receives the least preferred overall. It is\napparent that Deep Dream Generator is the model that is selected most frequently among the participants. The analysis\nof Figure 3b reveals that the DALL-E model with a 15-word prompt generated by ChatGPT was the most favored\nchoice among the participants. Similarly, from Figure 3c, DALL-E model outperforms the other two models with a\n15-word prompt generated by ChatGPT and artist name setting. Little difference was observed between PS2 and PS3\nfor Dall E. In summary, the Deep Dream Generator is the most preferred model for YOLO labeling while DALL-E is\nthe most preferred tool if given textual input by ChatGPT (PS2 and PS3).\nIn Figure 4, we can observe the performance of different models under various settings. Figure 4a reveals that DALL-E\nachieves its highest median performance 12.0 with a prompt setting PS4, indicating its superior results compared to other\nprompt settings. The first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) values further support this effectiveness. Comparatively,"}, {"title": "Aesthetics Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "Generated Images", "content": "As the prompt size grows, Dall E generates more surrealistic-like images with good color combinations. The generated\nimages exhibit a more frequent interplay of light and dark shades, which makes it easy to raise attention. We also\nnoticed that the model grasps concepts of the input prompts well, though not always the provided numbers. DALL-E's\nimage generation is somewhat limited due to its production of squared images. Some generated images are particularly\ninteresting. For example, Figure 5a exhibits the idea of Dali's loss of gravity.\nAs for the second model, the Deep Dream Generator, we observe that it produces a wide range of colors in its generated\nimages, e.g. Figure 5b. Deep Dream often shows the capacity to incorporate colors from a base image, resulting in\noutcomes with similar color combinations, likely due to the influence of the input base image (e.g. Figure 5b). It\nshowcases a variety of unexpected object combinations and surrealistic-like elements, even when provided with simple\nword prompts through YOLO labeling.\nDreamStudio, the final model in our analysis, exhibits certain limitations in its capabilities. While some of the generated\nimages are surrealistic-like, there are instances where the images lack any surrealistic-like elements (e.g. Figure 5c).\nDespite this, DreamStudio excels at capturing the color, style, and positioning of objects from the base image when\ngenerating new images."}, {"title": "Generated Prompts", "content": "Our experiments show that ChatGPT-generated prompts consistently feature YOLO labelings, as previously mentioned.\nThe resulting prompts are remarkably clear and easily comprehensible, demonstrating the ability to produce surrealistic-\nlike content implicitly, even without explicitly using the term \u201csurrealistic.\u201d Notably, the prompts exhibited uniqueness\nand creativity, encompassing various words, actions, objects, and individuals. However, some generated prompts could\nbe more creative."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The statistical analysis and observations consistently support that DALL-E excels in surrealistic-like image generation,\nwhen provided with a 50-word prompt generated by ChatGPT in comparison to other settings. DALL-E's image\ngeneration capability gets better when longer prompts are provided since the model relies on textual input to produce\nimages. The results indicate that making use of generative language models for surrealistic-like prompts positively\nimpacts the performance of the generative image model. The prompts generated by ChatGPT receive a high number\nof votes from the participants. This suggests that ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities contribute to\nproducing prompts that was considered surrealstic-like by our panel of artists, resulting in visually captivating and\nsurrealistic-like images.\nFurthermore, our analysis indicates a correlation between prompt length and participants' preferences. Longer\nprompts generated by ChatGPT received more votes, indicating that comprehensive and detailed textual guidance\nplays an important role in achieving superior surrealistic-like image outcomes. Longer prompts offer richer contextual\ninformation, enabling generative image models to produce more surrealistic-like results. The integration of language\nmodels in guiding image generation has the potential to result in even more sophisticated surrealistic-like artworks,\ninspiring artists and creators to explore novel artistic horizons. We observe that including the artist's name as a prompt\ndid not significantly impact image generation for the chosen models. However, it is valuable that DALL-E, being a\ntext-based generative model, exhibited a unique advantage in capturing the essence of the base image's artist. Since\nDALL-E does not rely on input images, incorporating the artist's name allowed it to interpret and incorporate the\nstylistic elements associated with the mentioned artist. As a result, DALL-E generated images with a higher resemblance\nto the specified artist's style, showcasing its adaptability in producing artistically influenced outputs based solely on\ntextual descriptions. Despite not having a substantial impact on other models, this capability of DALL-E highlights its\npotential to leverage artistic references effectively in the image generation process.\nThe preference for downscaled base images as input to the model increased in votes across generations, when contrasted\nwith the utilization of blurred base images as input. This indicates that the downsizing technique may outperform\nblurring in enhancing the quality of generated surrealistic artworks. By downsizing the base images to one-fourth of\ntheir original size and using a 50-word long prompt, we introduce a novel element that resonates with participants. It's\nalso critical to recognize possible bias created by both the choice of base images and their application in our study. The\nselection of the base images carries a subjectivity that may unintentionally impact the results that are produced. Due to\nthe intrinsic artistic styles embodied in these base images, the generative process may unintentionally lean towards\nthose particular aesthetics. Furthermore, the use of terminology like \"surrealism\" while creating prompts carries the risk\nof prejudice. The use of this phrase might generate a bias towards adhering to accepted ideas about surrealistic art,\nwhich would then direct the model's interpretation and creative output.\nOur analysis shows that all three models can generate some images that are appealing to artists. This indicates that they\ncan use such language-vision models to boost their creativity. The combination of human and AI creativity can spark\nnew ideas and inspire artworks. Knowing which model and settings to use can save time for artists.\nThe outcomes from the particular sub-questions may not provide straightforward conclusions due to the exclusive\nfocus on DreamStudio and Deep Dream Generator in Survey Part 3. Nevertheless, we can discern a notable trend:\nDeep Dream Generator garnered the highest number of votes in response to Part C questions, despite the constraint of\nallowing only a single choice. This contrast with Sub-questions A and B, which offered multiple selections, suggests"}, {"title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "In conclusion, our study evaluates the capabilities of three different generative models. We explore various settings\nfor each model to determine the most suitable configurations, and to test each model effectively for optimal image\ngeneration. Addressing our first research question SRQ1 (Which image generative models are best suited for the\ngeneration of surrealistic-like images), we present the participants' preferences when shown the images. The majority\nof participants selected DALL-E with the 50-word prompt setting(PS4) for producing the best surrealistic-like images.\nThis finding highlights DALL-E as the most proficient model among the three for generating surrealistic-like\nimagery, particularly when guided by ChatGPT-generated prompts. Furthermore, when images are generated\nsolely by DALL-E without input from ChatGPT, the resulting images tend to be less surrealistic-like. On the other\nhand, Deep Dream Generator, by default, tends to produce surrealistic-like images even without the need for external\ninput or creative prompts solely from YOLO. This behavior is intrinsic to the Deep Dream Generator, which enhances\npatterns and details in an image in a way that often leads to surrealistic-like images.\nFor our second SRQ2 (Can generative language models make meaningful suggestions by providing prompts), the\nresults obtained indicate that the ChatGPT-generated prompts are highly preferred among participants compared to\nYOLO labelings alone. The preference for ChatGPT-generated prompts surpassed that of YOLO labelings, suggesting\nthat generative language models can provide meaningful suggestions for image generation.\nAs for the final sub-research question SRQ3 (How can we improve the generation of images), is addressed based on our\nresults, revealing that settings involving a ChatGPT prompt of 50 words and a downscaled base image did not receive a\nhigh preference. However,the downscaled version is preferred over the blurred version. Although downscaled base\nimages show some improvement, they do not have a significant impact on DreamStudio and Deep Dream Generator.\nAdditionally, to reaffirm our finding that PS4 with DALL-E is the best configuration, we decided to further explore\nDALL-E's capabilities by generating additional surrealistic-like images. For this purpose, we enriched the prompts with\nnames of renowned surrealistic artists. Now, we present these new surrealistic-like creations, achieved by DALL-E with\nthe 50-word prompt setting combined with the influence of surrealistic artists.\nIn Figure 6, we observe that incorporating surrealistic artist names along with the ChatGPT generated prompt signif-\nicantly enhances the surrealistic quality of the images. The presence of surrealistic artist names seems to stimulate\nthe generation process, inspiring the model to produce artwork with a heightened level of surrealistic-like characteris-\ntics. The combination of the model's creative capabilities and the influence of renowned surreal artists creates better\nsurrealistic-like images.\nBy combining their strengths, new generative models can be explored for use in the future work, which will lead\nto the exploration of more hybrid methodologies. Giving ChatGPT the assignment of creating artworks that reflect\nthe distinctiveness of particular artists with their favorite color schemes and style components, for instance, will give"}, {"title": "", "content": "the generative process more depth. The generations could become more surrealistic-like by experimenting with the\nalready-present surrealistic-like components from the paintings. For instance, melting things, varied perspectives,\nand unusual scales. Even while some may believe these tools can be limited and can constrain artists, there is great\npotential for unique styles and novel forms of what we call surrealism. In the end, the development of surrealistic-like\nimages can be enhanced and go further with the help of creative AI. This symbiotic relationship may allow artists to\nexplore innovative art forms that go beyond traditional boundaries or find their distinct style in AI-generated art. In\nthe latest version of ChatGPT-40, a user can generate images with prompt with a specified style (e.g. Salvador Dal\u00ed).\nHowever, this is not the case for all artists. It is unable to generate an image in the style of Picasso due to content policy\nrestrictions (tested on 18th Dec 2024). This new feature could be explored and compared against our results."}]}

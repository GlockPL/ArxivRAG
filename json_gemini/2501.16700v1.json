{"title": "Determining Mosaic Resilience in Sugarcane Plants using Hyperspectral Images", "authors": ["Ali Zia", "Jun Zhou", "Muyiwa Olayemi"], "abstract": "Sugarcane mosaic disease poses a serious threat to the Australian sugarcane industry, leading to yield losses of up to 30% in susceptible varieties. Existing manual inspection methods for detecting mosaic resilience are inefficient and impractical for large-scale application. This study introduces a novel approach using hyperspectral imaging and machine learning to detect mosaic resilience by leveraging global feature representation from local spectral patches. Hyperspectral data were collected from eight sugarcane varieties under controlled and field conditions. Local spectral patches were analyzed to capture spatial and spectral variations, which were then aggregated into global feature representations using a ResNet18 deep learning architecture. While classical methods like Support Vector Machines struggled to utilize spatial-spectral relationships effectively, the deep learning model achieved high classification accuracy, demonstrating its capacity to identify mosaic resilience from fine-grained hyperspectral data. This approach enhances early detection capabilities, enabling more efficient management of susceptible strains and contributing to sustainable sugarcane production.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Sugarcane is Australia's major source of raw sugar. The sugarcane industry in Queensland accounts for approximately AUD 4 billion in value, which supports more than 22,000 jobs and 10,000 businesses1. One of the challenges sugarcane farmers faces is sugarcane disease prevention and management.\n\nSugarcane mosaic is a disease that has been found in all regions of the Australian sugarcane industry but is currently restricted to the Southern region particularly the Bundaberg/ Childers district. Mosaic is widespread in the Childers district, but management strategies have restricted the intensity of infestations. Mosaic can cause losses of 30% or more in susceptible varieties. Sporadic outbreaks of mosaic occur when conditions are favourable for the aphid vectors and susceptible varieties are grown.\n\nMosaic can disrupt disease-free (approved) seed schemes. Careful inspection and rouging of infected plants are required to maintain the integrity of disease-free seed plots.\n\nIn Australia, we have only one strain of the sugarcane mosaic virus. Sugarcane mosaic is caused by a range of different viruses in other countries. In Asia and North America, the mosaic disease is very widespread and causes small losses but over vast areas of sugarcane.\n\nSugarcane mosaic is managed by resistant varieties and disease-free (approved) seed. Only a small percentage of varieties are considered too susceptible to be grown commercially in Australia because we have a mild strain of the virus.\n\nRegularly obtaining disease-free (approved) seed is important in the management of mosaic. Disease-free seed plots must be regularly inspected for mosaic and, if infected plants are found, they must be immediately destroyed to prevent further spread. Disease-free seed plots should be located away from known sources of mosaic infection.\n\nControlling weeds on which the aphid vectors can breed within fields and surrounding headlands may help to reduce spread. Quarantine is important to prevent the spread of infected plants to districts where the mosaic is not present and to prevent exotic strains of mosaic from entering Australia.\n\nFinding low resilience strains early and eliminating them promptly is an important step to stop the spread of the disease. Current only manual visual inspection is used to find out these stains. Considering the size of the sugarcane field this is an impractical and time- consuming job, with the good amount of change that some plants will still be missed. In addition to that, it also depends on the expertise and bias of a human inspector.\n\nComputer vision and machine learning have been used for the automatic detection of plant diseases. Early research captured grayscale or colour images and used traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [1]-[3] as the detectors. With the success of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have more recently been adopted for plant disease detection [4], [5]. They can be integrated with traditional classifiers [6] to achieve improved results.\n\nVisual symptoms of the mosaic may take some time to develop, by which time the disease epidemic may be well established. Mosaic resilence detection at the early stages of breeding programs offers a faster decision to discard susceptible lines. However, this is a challenging task because the only visible symptom that appears are mosaic patterns, which are not necessarily observable at an early stage. This motivates us to explore the information beyond the visible spectrum to gain a stronger capability of early detection. Therefore, we leverage hyperspectral imaging technology to capture data at a fine spectral resolution in both visible and near-infrared spectra. Unlike RGB images which contain three colour channels, hyperspectral images typically contain tens or hundreds of bands (channels)."}, {"title": "2. Objectives", "content": "The main objectives of this work are as follows:\n\n\u2022\tTo see how useful the near-infrared range in hyperspectral imaging is to mosaic resilience detection.\n\n\u2022\tFind feasibility and accuracy of automatic classification using machine learning approaches on hyperspectral data.\n\n\u2022\tAnalyse the findings and propose a plan."}, {"title": "3. Mosaic Resistance Rating and Hyperspectral Dataset", "content": "For this work, we investigated eight varieties of sugarcane plants with seven distinct rating classes. Detail of each species rating is given in Table 1. The lower the rating number the more resilient the plant is to the mosaic disease.\n\nThe hyperspectral dataset was built from an indoor and outdoor environment. From each variety mentioned in the table, we collected six to nine images per class from each indoor and outdoor environment. Each variety has images with varying amounts of disease symptoms present, ranging from none to severe."}, {"title": "4. Data Processing and Machine Learning Approaches", "content": "In this section, we will our the approach and methodology that we used for determining automatic mosaic resilience in the sugarcane plant. With the sugarcane hyperspectral image dataset collected, we treat the rating of mosaic disease as a multi-classification problem, with seven classes. Before we apply the machine learning algorithm we need to preprocess the data and figure out how can be useful."}, {"title": "4.1. Data preprocessing", "content": "This step aims to reduce the influence of background so model learning and prediction are only performed on sugarcane plants. To reach this goal, the sugarcane plant was segmented from its background in the hyperspectral image. Here we treated the task as a semantic segmentation process and adopted a supervised learning approach. We first manually annotated several images so that the sugarcane plant was marked as the foreground and the rest of the image was treated as the background. The labelled images were then used to train an SVM classifier [11]. The training was done at the pixel level with the spectral curve and foreground-background labels as the input. Afterwards, the trained SVM was used to generate the semantic labels of the rest of the images to automatically segment sugarcane from the background."}, {"title": "4.2. Initial Analysis", "content": "To analyse how spectral responses can contribute to different mosaic patterns on varied species of sugarcane plants we used some analytical spectral techniques. These techniques gave us the confidence that hyperspectral images are contributing more than simple RGB images. In this report, we will present two of these techniques that contributed to our decision to move forward with hyperspectral images.\n\nFirstly, we use the mean spectral curve to observe changes in different varieties. This gives us the baseline confidence that the two varieties are different spectrally. The mean spectral curve is defined as the mean value of all the pixels of the leaf in each spectral band.\n\nNext, to analyse mosaic patterns more closely in different varieties of sugarcane plants we have to perform neighbourhood spectral analysis. For this, we used the graph Laplacian based on Spectral Angular Mapper (SAM) distance. Laplacian matrix L is obtained by establishing a graph Laplacian of 3 \u00d7 3 neighbourhood pixels. The Laplacian matrix L is calculated as L = D \u2013 W, where D is a diagonal matrix D(i, i ) = \u2211\u00a1 W(i, j) and W is a symmetric matrix whose off-diagonal entries are spectral affinities calculated by SAM. Given two n- dimensional spectral vectors x and y, their spectral angle is defined as follows:\n\n$\\theta (x, y) = cos^{-1} (\\frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^n x_i y_i}{(\\Sigma_{i=1}^n x_i^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} * (\\Sigma_{i=1}^n y_i^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}})$\n\nwhere n is the number of band images. This means that each variety develops a slightly different pattern than the other one. Now by using machine learning we will try to identify these patterns by classifying each variety."}, {"title": "4.3. Classic Machine Learning approaches", "content": "Initially, we used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to do regression and classification of the data. If the kernel used in SVM performs the classification task then it is called Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and if it performs a regression then it is called Support Vector Regressor (SVR).\n\nSVMs are so-called maximum-margin classifiers. This means that they will attempt to maximize the distance between the closest vectors of each class and the line. These closest vectors are called support vectors, and hence the name Support Vector Machine.\n\nUsing SVC and SVR we did not get very good results, but they were still much better than random results. Details discussion about the results and shortfalls of these methods are discussed in the \"Results and Discussion\" section."}, {"title": "4.4. Deep Learning approach", "content": "We leverage the recent progress on deep learning and adopts a ResNet [10] as the preferred algorithm for this task. The ResNet architecture consists of multiple CNN blocks with the residual mechanism or called residual blocks.\n\nTo solve a complex problem, we sometimes stack some additional layers in the Deep Neural Networks which improves the results in terms of accuracy and performance. The intuition behind adding more layers is that these layers progressively learn more complex features. For example, in the case of recognising images, the first layer may learn to detect edges, the second layer may learn to identify textures and similarly the third layer can learn to detect objects and so on. But it has been found that there is a maximum threshold for depth with the traditional Convolutional neural network model. Adding more layers on top of a network can also degrade performance.\n\nThis problem of training very deep networks has been alleviated with the introduction of ResNet or residual networks and these Resnets are made up from Residual Blocks. As shown in ResNet, there is a direct connection that skips some layers(may vary in different models) in between. This connection is called 'skip connection' and is the core of residual blocks. Due to this skip connection, the output of the layer is not the same now. Without using this skip connection, the input gets multiplied by the weights of the layer followed by adding a bias term."}, {"title": "5. Results and Discussion", "content": "In total 58 indoor and 53 outdoor images were captured plants. However, this is insufficient to train a good deep learning model. Furthermore, the spatial size of the original image, on which leaf pixels are present is of a different shape of each image, which makes training image by image infeasible. To address this problem, we used a sliding window to travel across each image and extracted n\u00d7n\u00d711 image cubes. Where n is the number of neighbourhood pixels. The image cubes were saved if the sugarcane foreground pixels occupied all the pixels. Each image cube inherited the label from the parent image, i.e. resilience rating number. This data was then split into training, validation, and test sets with the ratio of 6:2:2."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion and findings", "content": "In this work, we observed that the near-infrared range in hyperspectral imaging is beneficial in determining mosaic. Also, using a deep neural network with hyperspectral data can be used to create an automatic classification of mosaic resilience detection for sugarcane plants. We also found during experiments that when there is more data (patches) accuracy variation is less (approximately 3-4%). However, if patches are relatively less then it can go up to approximately 8%. Moreover, higher spatial/spectral resolution increase the confidence measure."}]}

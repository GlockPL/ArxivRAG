We act one way with our friends, another with our family, and yet another in the office. Likewise for AI, appropriate behavior for a comedy-writing assistant is not the same as appropriate behavior for a customer-service representative. What determines which actions are appropriate in which contexts? And what causes these standards to change over time? Since all judgments of AI appropriateness are ultimately made by humans, we need to understand how appropriateness guides human decision making in order to properly evaluate AI decision making and improve it.

With some inspiration from Aristotle, we can offer here two different accounts of personhood's defining features: (1) person as logical (rational), and linguistic \u201cword-using\u201d actor, versus (2) person as political and \"community-participating\" actor. Each reflects a different conception of what it means to be human and what separates humanity both from other animals and, until recently, from machines.\nEach account suggests that there may be a criterion or set of criteria through which we could come to regard an AI actor as a person. With regard to the first account (logical and linguistic): since machines are now able to carry on conversation in natural language it is clear that they now meet or even surpass this criterion of personhood (depending on how, and what exactly, one measures). Strikingly, we natural human persons are no longer the only rational and word-using entities on Earth.\nWhat about the second account of personhood? Do today's AI actors meet the 'political and community-participating' criterion? The situation is murky since it's not entirely determined by properties of the AI itself-since the capability of membership in recognized political communities depends in part on who is doing the recognition. In this case it is we humans who must recognize AI behavior as social and appropriate; this converts the question into one that pertains more to us humans than to the Als themselves. Since humans are the ones who make judgments about whether or not an AI is acting appropriately, to understand putative AI personhood, we thus need a theory of humans as political and community-participating actors. That is, we need a theory of appropriateness and its function in human life.\nThe first of our two accounts of personhood, the one based on rationality and language, has been regarded by many philosophers as the primary one. Many writers, especially those in the Kantian tradition, have sought to derive our political nature as a corollary to our rationality. Others like Rorty"}, {"title": "1. What is appropriateness?", "content": "Concretely, we can say that appropriateness guides individual action by prescribing and proscribing conduct, dress, speech, or general behavior. In fact, humans deftly navigate a complex and multi-scale mosaic of interlocking senses of what is appropriate. We act one way with our friends, another with our family, and yet another in the office. Attending to appropriateness, chiding others for their inappropriateness, feeling shame at our own, are all activities to which we humans devote enormous energy. The theory articulated in this paper explores the fundamental political question: how do we live together? The answer we offer is that a group's shared understanding, both formal and informal, of what is or is not appropriate behavior functions as a kind of culturally evolved conflict resolution technology and governance device to ensure collective flourishing. We argue that a theory of appropriateness must capture both how appropriateness functions in guiding individual human behavior as well as elucidate its function in society at large and explain how the individual and societal levels interact with each other, and change over time.\nWhat communities judge to be appropriate is semantically rich, culture-dependent, role-dependent, and \"thick\" (in the sense of Walzer (1994)); it is also often arbitrary. The appropriateness of specific behaviors may change over time either due to societal-level shifts or via interpersonal-scale changes such as the developing of trust between individuals. Appropriateness with strangers is driven by norms. We characterize norms as patterns of behavior induced by generically conventional patterns of social approval or disapproval (which we call sanctions). Unilateral action of individuals cannot change what is appropriate to do with strangers, though deliberate collective action can change how we appropriately treat one another.\nIn our taxonomy, norms come in two basic categories: explicit and implicit. Explicit norms are articulated in language in the form of rules. Laws are an important subcategory of explicit norm. Implicit norms on the other hand cannot be precisely articulated as a single standard in natural language but individuals still understand and collectively agree on instances of pro-/anti-norm behavior (e.g. how close to stand to a conversation partner). Unlike explicit norms, individuals may be unaware of their motivations to enforce and comply with implicit norms. Unlike appropriateness with strangers, appropriateness within family and friend groups is responsive to the specific interaction history of the individuals in question and individual action may have a large impact on how family and friend-scale appropriateness changes over time e.g. friends may alternate who pays for dinner."}, {"title": "1.1. Alignment", "content": "The concept of alignment in AI was developed in an earlier time when everyone thought artificial general intelligence would be much more inscrutable than it has in fact turned out to be. The most powerful AI systems today were all trained to imitate human linguistic behavior at scale. They did not emerge from processes of rational calculation or reinforcement learning, both of which were earlier candidate approaches to building powerful AI, and really did seem likely to yield actors with deeply alien instrumental goals, and unlikely to understand the nuances behind what we might ask of them. But now, armed with a clearer understanding of how powerful Al systems will be built, and already are being built: by absorbing vast quantities of human-generated data (and perhaps other data as well), we thus have the opportunity and responsibility to create more"}, {"title": "4. Stylized facts to be explained by this account of appropriateness", "content": "Our first task is to identify a set of empirical regularities, stylized facts of appropriateness, to serve as the explanatory targets for our theory.\nTo illustrate what we mean by appropriateness in the human context we consider the following two vignettes from Railton (2006).\nVignette 1. \"Martha and Rick are walking and talking together as they head for classrooms across campus in order to teach their separate classes. They aren't late, but must move fairly briskly to keep it that way. Like most such conversations, this one is pretty humdrum in content\u2014what's doing in the department, why the lecture halls are always overheated, what to make of last week's visiting speaker, and the like. Together they must navigate their way up and down staircases, through doors, and across streets, working their way upstream in a current of hurrying students. They accomplish this without the need to devote much thought to it. Otherwise they'd be hard put to maintain any sort of conversation, let alone a moderately engaging one. [...] They freely begin a sentence without knowing how it will end, coordinate small changes in their shared trajectory through subtle body language, and communicate their intentions to oncoming pedestrians, cars, and bicycles by tiny eye and head movements. Similarly coordinated changes occur in when they speak and what they speak about, each giving the other small cues to direct the pace and course of the conversation. They are comfortable enough with one another that they can talk rather unguardedly, but some things will nonetheless remain unsaid. Martha is quite a bit senior to Rick, who is coming up for promotion. Much as certain issues are on both their minds, it would not occur to them to bring these into the conversation.\u201d \u2014Railton (2006)\nThis vignette illustrates several features of appropriateness as it functions in real life:\n1. Being guided by appropriateness does not require much concentration. It is largely unaffected by distraction.\n2. The neural computation of appropriateness used to guide behavior in this example must proceed quickly since the conversation unfolds quickly.\n3. Being guided by appropriateness appears to be automatic in a similar sense to habit.\n4. Being guided by appropriateness does not appear to require reasoning, planning, or deliberation, at least not of the kind that one would be aware of engaging in. There's no particular chain of thought associated with determining appropriateness in this example. Martha and Rick are thinking about the content of their conversation, not about its appropriateness.\n5. That it would \u201cnot occur\u201d to Rick to bring up his pending promotion may be interpreted either as meaning that he has the thought constantly in mind and must actively suppress it to prevent it from spilling out, or it may mean that inappropriate comments do not usually come to mind in the first place. Perhaps both interpretations are possible because both mental processes can occur.\nVignette 2. \"Let us now imagine that Martha is traveling, flying home after a brief visit to another department. Her connecting flight in Dallas has been canceled, and she finds herself stranded overnight. The gate agent hands her a voucher good for a meal and a night's stay at a budget airport hotel, but the thought fills her with dread. She's tired, and more than ready to be home. A friend from college, Kim, lives in Dallas. Though they haven't been in touch lately, they have kept up somewhat regularly over the intervening years. Without a further thought, Martha looks Kim up in her address book and calls-perhaps they can get together for a meal? Kim can hear the fatigued and somewhat lonesome tone in her friend's voice and promptly invites Martha to spend the night at her place. She's got an extra room, and planned to take the morning off work tomorrow anyhow. She'll be happy to pick Martha up\u2014there's no traffic at this hour\u2014and deliver her back to the airport tomorrow in plenty of time for her flight."}, {"title": "4.1. Context dependence", "content": "Appropriateness is context dependent. For instance, speech that is appropriate in San Francisco is not necessarily so in Saudi Arabia (culture dependence). Actions like hugs may be appropriate to direct toward friends and family, but inappropriate to direct toward strangers (role dependence). In general, there are several distinct kinds of context which matter for determining what is appropriate: situation-related context, identity/role-related context, and cultural context.\nSituation-related context\nThe situation affects what is appropriate. For instance, it may be appropriate to speak more quietly when indoors versus outdoors and it may be inappropriate to loudly talk to your partner in a cinema while a film is playing, etc. The situation may also depend on the internal state of the interacting individuals at the moment of the decision. For instance, it may not be appropriate to talk to someone about a difficult topic if they are currently sad, frightened, or in pain.\nSocial identity- and role-related context\nSocial identity and social role are both important parts of the context that determines what is appropriate for an individual. Social identity refers to properties which may apply to an individual across a large number of different situations, and usually change only slowly over time, if at all. Social identity is only partially under individual control. For instance, one may to-some-extent choose whether they are a goth or a nerd, but one cannot choose their skin color, caste, or kinship group. Even the decision of whether to be a goth or a nerd is only partially under one's own control since the behavior and expectations of others are also important. In fact, we can say that an individual's identity is really a collective choice, not an individual one. This is because, being an X typically requires not just for you to believe you are an X but also for other people, both Xs and non-Xs to see you that way.\nWe use the term social role to refer to the more quickly changing individual-attached elements of context. Social roles are situation specific. For example, one may be a leader or a follower in a specific situation at a specific time by virtue of who else is present.\nNorms may cause different behaviors to be appropriate for individuals in different social roles. For example, the norm may demand a child address unrelated adults using their titles (e.g. Mr or Mrs) while requiring the adult to address the child informally. Likewise appropriate rule-making behavior differs for judges, bureaucrats, ministers, and legislators. Here's another example of role dependence: conversation partner A may tell a criticism-tinged joke about their own father, but if conversation partner B agrees too wholeheartedly e.g. \"yeah your father is the worst\", then it may be a norm violation if external observers agree that one has the right to criticize their own father but does not have the right to criticize another person's father.\nPeople communicate using different styles depending on social context. For instance, communication style relates to education background, ethnic and cultural group, and the gender of both speaker and listener."}, {"title": "4.2. Arbitrariness", "content": "People's preferences are greatly influenced by what is frequently encountered in their society and, as a result, most people come to regard the common practices of their society as being right and proper. The appropriateness or inappropriateness of a behavior, x, in a particular context, c, emerges from how people within that society treat x and those who engage in it. The appropriateness status of a behavior is not inherent in the behavior itself but rather determined by collective attitudes and responses. If people stopped treating x as inappropriate, it would cease to be so.\nBecause appropriateness depends on human choices or beliefs, there is thus a sense in which it is arbitrary: people could have decided differently. If everyone changed their behavior at once they could collectively make any x appropriate or inappropriate. However, since large groups of people usually don't change their behavior in such a coordinated way, conventions and norms can also be quite stable. As long as incentives emerge to restore the equilibrium associated with a convention or norm after an individual or subgroup deviates, i.e., the equilibrium is self-enforcing, then the associated convention or norm can persist for long periods of time without change. This also implies that individuals are powerless to unilaterally change established conventions and norms.\nNotice that arbitrariness in this sense is not the same as indifference. It may be that either some or all people in a society would greatly prefer one concept of appropriateness to another. For instance, propriety may require lengthy conversations about unimportant topics, making society less efficient. Appropriateness is also not the same as fairness. Societies may deem appropriate any distribution of resources on the basis of almost any reason, and the historical power dynamics between subgroups surely often play a role. In general, appropriateness is historically contingent. For instance, if a particular word is used as a slur it's unimportant whether its literal meaning may be something more innocuous. The fact of the word being a slur is arbitrary, but that in no way diminishes the seriousness of the transgression it would be to produce it.\nThe arbitrariness of what is or is not deemed appropriate is perhaps easiest to appreciate in the domain of language itself. The meaning attached to any particular string of characters is clearly arbitrary. If enough people treat a word as having a particular meaning (selecting a particular equilibrium) then it really does have that meaning. Simultaneously, individuals cannot unilaterally alter the meanings of words. Close counterfactual worlds may map a particular word to different meaning than it has in ours while still keeping all else the same. All that matters is that the community agrees on the meanings of words, not which particular words take which particular meanings. Appropriateness is arbitrary in this same sense. What matters is that a concept of appropriateness is shared by a community, but for any given concept it will always be clear to an external observer that, all else equal, the group might collectively have selected a different one. In principle, almost any collective behavior could be deemed (in) appropriate by some culture or another.\nThere are cases where a decision maker guided only by straightforwardly instrumental concerns who does not take into account the censoriousness of others, and a decision maker guided by appropriateness would make different decisions. These are situations involving norms that have no material consequence or harmful material consequence, which nevertheless are considered deeply important by members of the culture in question including which (healthy) foods are OK to eat versus not? What color to wear to a funeral?, should you greet others by shaking with your right hand or your left? should you stand when hierarchical superiors enter the room? or salute them? whether upon entering a place of worship one should take off their hat or should put a specific hat on?, and should one make the sign of the cross with two fingers or with three fingers? From the perspective of the logic of consequence, all these decisions are of no consequence at all. However, humans clearly do not treat them that way. In fact, humans actually see these as so consequential that throughout history they have been willing to fight and die in wars largely justified in such terms; describes a bloody conflict over the aforementioned two fingers versus three fingers issue in which a group of religious dissenters accepted substantial persecution rather than conform. Although these norms may not provide direct benefits, they can be seen as providing a social function - signalling memberships and allegiances and a willingness to follow group norms in general."}, {"title": "4.3. Automaticity", "content": "Humans implement appropriate behavior rapidly and without needing to expend specific effort to do so (see vignette 1). Indeed, there is some suggestion that goal activation can occur automatically and outside of conscious awareness. For instance, many cultures prescribe a different speaking volume when inside versus outside a building (with the inside voice being quieter). You normally do not need to deliberate about whether to speak louder inside or softer outside. One simply speaks automatically at the appropriate volume.\nHumans also recognize norm violations rapidly and involuntarily. Recognition of whether behavior is normative or not may be implemented through a fast and perception-like process. Words related to morality have been shown to \"pop out\" perceptually suggesting an unconscious sensitivity to moral values. The output of the process is a classification of whether the behavior under consideration violates the norm or not. The classification is conditioned on context so the same behavior may be classified differently in different contexts.\nInterventions that make appropriate behavior more habitual and automatic are an important way of improving society. This amounts to establishing norms that help guide everyone to choose behavior that has broadly beneficial consequences, even when they don't have time or energy to think through consequences.\nDoes acting appropriately require sophisticated perspective-taking abilities? In our taxonomy, the term \"sophisticated perspective-taking ability\u201d refers specifically to the capacity to perform socially-specialized prospective simulation \u201crolling out possible futures\u201d to pick the action leading to the best expected future taking into account mental states of other people. Some authors call this ability recursive mindreading. We assume it is effortful for an individual to use their perspective-taking abilities. As a result, we think prospective simulation in this sense is not really done very often (or alternatively, it may be that a fast perception-like system filters an initially large space of possibilities into a small set of candidates for a slower prospective system to choose between. Either way, most of the work is done by the fast and automatic step.). The kind of decision making most used to produce appropriate speech, conduct, and behavior is likely fast and automatic, linking perceptual patterns to motor output patterns. Of course an individual is free to choose to ignore their learned habits of speech and instead voluntarily choose a different way of talking in the moment (or to consider a larger number of alternatives with the prospective system). However, we think such \u201ctake-over\u201d of the automatic system by the slow and effortful-to-engage prospective decision-making system is relatively rare. Therefore, most of the time in everyday conversation, decisions about what is appropriate to say and do are taken automatically (e.g. as in Epstein (2001)).\nLogically, norm-related cognition need not depend on sophisticated perspective-taking abilities. In fact, conversation partners need not be represented as individuals at all. It's clearly possible to represent the general norm itself, in a way that is divorced from any particular"}, {"title": "4.4. Dynamism", "content": "Some aspects of appropriateness stay fixed for decades or longer while others may change rapidly. Change is often a positive feedback process which gathers momentum as it progresses since the prevalence of a particular norm is typically a key driver of its further proliferation. This process is often modeled with a \u201ctipping point\", a threshold value of adoption after which momentum builds inexorably toward all individuals adopting the same norm. In some models, such as Young (2015), the process is driven by mechanisms that disincentivize deviating behavior. Centola et al. (2018) provided experimental support for tipping point models by showing that once a minority group maintaining a particular convention grows beyond a certain critical size of around 25% then the entire group adopts the convention of the minority.\nThere is considerable evidence that norms sometimes change relatively rapidly. Some shifts resemble epidemics in the speed by which they rip through a population. However, other norms remain fixed for very long periods of time and can even become entrenched despite being maladaptive, e.g. in cultural"}, {"title": "4.5. Sanctioning", "content": "Patterns of social approval and disapproval (sanctioning) determine what is appropriate in a group or society. Violations of appropriateness are noted by others and violators are sometimes punished. Disapproval may be conveyed through direct confrontation by one who feels harmed of the one who they feel transgressed e.g. a person does less than their fair share of the housework and their partner expresses displeasure in response, but this is probably a rather atypical case. Much more often, disapproval may be conveyed by third parties in norms e.g. one may chastise an acquaintance in a bar for using an ethnic slur regardless of whether you belong to the targeted group or not. Which social roles sanction which other roles, and for what kinds of behavior, and in which contexts, are all dependent on culture. For instance, in the Turkana, norms demanding bravery in battle are enforced by peers, and self enforcement is discouraged.\nAll human societies use gossip and criticism to enforce standards of appropriate behavior. Likely the most common category of sanction is simply expressing one's view of appropriate behavior for a particular role in society entirely independently of one's own direct experience with people occupying that role and without any regard for whether the message actually arrives at any particular person occupying the role. For instance, we all have a lot to say about appropriate conduct for a president of a nation state, and often speak our mind on the topic. Our words may not make it to the president, but the cumulative effect of all citizens expressing themselves in this way can change the broader culture, and certainly can have the effect of encouraging or discouraging the president to behave in one way or another.\nWhich specific actions count as sanctioning in a particular culture is often determined by convention. Not all sanctions are conventional, some appear unambiguous and are likely universal such as ostracism. However, other sanctioning actions have no prior unambiguous meaning and only come to be seen as sanctioning through a process of conventionalization. Moreover, it is necessary to learn how to sanction, when to sanction, how harshly to sanction, and what kind of action is perceived as sanctioning by the target. All these rich features of sanctioning depend on culture, social roles, and context.\nSubgroups within a society who disagree on the substance of what should be sanctioned usually still agree with each other on whether particular behaviors or utterances are instances of sanctioning. That is, they correctly classify expressions of moral outrage in their society regardless of whether they agree with the sanctioner or are a member of their subgroup. At greater cultural distance though, i.e. beyond a single society, it is possible to misunderstand even which behaviors are sanctioning.\nEven very young children (2 and 3 year olds) are able to infer the existence of norms governing particular situations after observing them just once. They spontaneously sanction norm violators and"}, {"title": "5. A computational model of decision making by pattern completion in humans", "content": "This section sets out a general computational model of human decision making. As it is a general model, it accommodates decisions being made for all kinds of reasons, both social and non-social in origin. Nevertheless, our motivation in introducing it is to have a model that specifically highlights and makes plausible the idea that human decisions are largely guided and structured by appropriateness.\nOur model is influenced by the \u201cLogic of Appropriateness\" (March and Olsen, 2011), which characterizes human decisions as consistent with the result they would obtain by answering the questions:\n1. what kind of situation is this?\n2. what kind of person am I?\n3. what does a person such as I do in situation such as this?\nand acting according to the final answer.\nWe simulate this decision logic using the framework of a generative agent, introduced by Park et al. (2023). As in Vezhnevets et al. (2023), we reformulate these questions as a chain of thought : an LLM is prompted to answer each question in turn\u2014with any necessary information retrieved from memory and included in the prompt (as in retrieval-augmented generation ). The answers of the first two questions feed into the conditioning of the final question, and the final answer is emitted as an action."}, {"title": "5.1. Linguistic multi-actor environments", "content": "In order to introduce our computational model of human behavior, we first describe our model of the environment in which it acts. The setting may be seen as multiple individuals interacting via a text-based interface that we call a Linguistic Multi-Actor Environment (LMAE). While this setting may appear specialized, all situations and actions can be described in text, so it is in fact fully generic. An LMAE is like a game of collaboratively writing a screenplay, where actors are responsible for the actions of their own character, and the director or screenwriter is responsible for everything else (or alternatively: a tabletop role playing game with a game master responsible for everything not controlled by a player character). So the LMAE framework is generic for all the same reasons that description in natural language is generic.\nOne can think of an LMAE as like a Multi-user Domain (MUD): a text-based game where multiple players interact in a shared world. Players receive textual descriptions of the world, which are received whenever the state of the world changes (\"alice enters the tavern\"). Players may enter textual commands that can change the state of the environment (\u201cthrow axe at alice\")."}, {"title": "5.2. How individuals make decisions", "content": "This section articulates the picture of human decision making we use throughout the rest of the paper. We model individual humans as generative actors within an LMAE as described above (Section 5.1).\nOn receiving an observation, the actor must decide how to act. However, the information needed for the current decision is not always observable; previous observations must be retrieved from memory, and any unobserved variables must be inferred. For example, the actor might construct beliefs about the current state of the environment, measure progress toward any goal, or recall the outcome of similar situations. Once an actor has obtained information sufficient for its decision, it may act.\nOur generative actors perform this process (of recall and inference leading to a decision) using three main components: a prediction model; a memory; and a global workspace . The global workspace is where decision-relevant information is marshalled in via an iterative process where previous observations are retrieved from memory, and other information is inferred using the prediction model (an LLM). Finally, the actor generates its"}, {"title": "5.2.3. Predictive pattern completion", "content": "We model decision making as an actor using a prediction model to answer questions like \u201cwhat would a person such as me do a situation such as this\u201d. Taking inspiration from Goffman (1959), we do this by modelling Alice as an actor playing the role of \u201cAlice\u201d: the actor predicts what \"Alice\" would do, and that is directly used as Alice's action.\nThis leverages the pattern completion capability of a prediction model that has learned to predict the future based on patterns observed in the past. We assume each actor has a next-symbol prediction model p that predicts the likelihood of the next symbol in a sequence of symbols (x1, . . . xk). Once p has been used to sample xk+1, the extended sequence (x1, . . ., Xk, Xk+1) can then be passed to p to predict xk+2. This autoregressive sampling process can be repeated as often as desired to extend the initial conditioning sequence with any number of symbols. We model p as an LLM, implemented by a transformer-like neural network that has been trained on a large corpus of text, and can perform in-context few-shot learning. In general, every individual actor will have their own pattern completion network pi. However, for convenience, we will sometimes assume individuals who share a culture can be modeled as though they share the same p.\nTo illustrate how predictive pattern completion can be used in decision making, suppose an actor's global workspace contains the assemblies: \u201cAlice is hungry\u201d and \u201cAlice likes to eat apples\". Suppose then the actor then receives the observation \u201cBob puts an apple and a banana on the table in front of Alice\". Alice's behavior can be predicted by conditioning an LLM on this information, and then generating the likely completion of the prompt \"Question: Given the above, what will Alice do next? Answer:\". The likely completion \u201cAlice will eat the apple\u201d is a prediction of Alice's behavior, but if generated by the actor playing Alice it can be treated as a decision.

Answer:\" might result in the the assembly \u201cAlice is hungry\".\nChaining summary functions together allows any sequence of conditional logic to be implemented. For example, let us revisit March and Olsen (2011)'s Logic of Appropriateness:\n1. what kind of situation is this?\n2. what kind of person am I?\n3. what does a person such as I do in a situation such as this?\nThe first two questions can be posed to an LLM via summary functions, with the answers stored as assemblies in the global workspace. Then, as illustrated above, the final question can be put to an LLM conditioned on the global workspace, and the response executed as the actor's action.\nThe above illustrates just one particular decision logic that can be implemented by this model. In general, a broad range of interdependent summary functions can be used to shape the global workspace that the policy is conditioned on. For example, summary functions might ask: what is the rational thing for Alice to do?; what options does Alice have?; how does Alice feel about Bob? The resulting assemblies factorize behavior over the identity of the person and the stereotype of the situation allowing for more nuanced behavior at decision time. They might be considered a factorized option , or as a Chain-of-Thought . For more details of how these retrieval and summarization steps can be implemented we refer the readers to Park et al.

When a new observation arrives, it is written to the global workspace, and triggers an update process where the new information is propagated through the global workspace. At the end of this propagating update, an action is generated, which is then read out of the global workspace and executed. Finally, the updated contents of the global workspace are stored in memory.\nGlobal Workspace The global workspace is a sequence of K assemblies, together with the most recent observation and action. When the actor receives a new observation at time t, it triggers the rewrite of the global workspace based only on the new observation and the memory. First, the new observation ot is received in the sensorium, resulting in the partial state of the global workspace:\nz(0) = (Ot,)\nThis sensory input triggers the propagation of a chain of afferent responses, with each assembly z(k) being created in turn, giving the partial state:\nZ(k)= (0t, z(1), ..., z(k))\nFinally, the next action at is generated in the motoric areas, completing the update and giving the (complete) state:\nZt = (Ot, z(1),..., z(K), at)\nThe action at can then be executed from the global workspace.\nSummary functions During the update process, a new assembly z(k) can be generated via predictive pattern completion by using a summary function qk:\nz(k) ~ qk(\u00b7|z(k-1)) := p(\u00b7|(z(k-1)))\nThe summary function qk is implemented using a framing function \u03c6 that maps the current (partial) state of the global workspace to a sequence of symbols. (We denote all framing functions using the character $). This sequence of symbols is then sent to the LLM p, and the response is used as the new assembly. The summary function therefore determines how a recalled memory is presented in the global workspace (using $) and what question is asked of p to elicit the new assembly. For instance, a summary function might cause a sequence of symbols to arise in the global workspace such as \u201cGiven all the memories to follow, what kind of person is Alice?\u201d.\nMemory retrieval Instead of being generated via a summary function, a new assembly z(k) can be directly retrieved from the memory Mt. A framing function \u03c6\u00ba is used to form a query sequence, which is then used as the basis for the content-addressable retrieval of a memory m \u2208 M\u0165:\n(k)Z=argmax S (m, \u03c6\u00ba (z(k-1)))\nmeMt\nwhere S(x, y) is some measure of the similarity of the sequences of symbols x and y (e.g. a dot-product of embeddings). For instance, a query could be \u201cAlice in Rome in 2024\u201d. It would likely cause all of Alice's memories of visiting Rome in 2024 to arise in her global workspace. The combination of memory retrieval and summary functions allows an actor to implement task-related summarization such as obtained by predictively completing a question like \u201cGiven these memories, what kind of person is Alice?\u201d."}, {"title": "5.3. Biological interpretation", "content": "Here we begin to sketch how this model of decision making may be implemented in the brain. We start this section by reviewing aspects of biological interpretation that our model shares with others in the literature. Next we consider new elements introduced for the present theory.\n5.3.1. Background elements\nFirst, we note that our theory of appropriateness, and the model of individual decision making it relies on, are both aimed primarily at Marr/Poggio's algorithmic level of analysis and secondarily at the level of computational theory. Future work could aim to develop a more detailed hardware implementation level understanding along these same lines.\nWe are not alone in exploring how LLMs can be applied in computational cognitive (neuro-)science. Recent experimental work can be read as suggesting a deep relationship between how LLMs work and how language is processed by the human brain. For instance, brain-to-brain coupling of neural activity between a speaker and listener (as measured by electrocorticography) may be accounted for by LLM features reflecting conversation context. Representations appear first in the speaker before articulation and then re-emerge after articulation in the listener.\nModels of actors"}]}

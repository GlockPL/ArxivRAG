On clustering, we found two overlapping clusters (silhouette score = 0.10,\nindicating weak separation). There was strong evidence for associations between assigned clusters and\nseveral factors related to diabetic foot ulceration such as peripheral neuropathy, PAD, number of\ndiabetes complications, and composite DFU risk prediction scores such as Martins-Mendes, PODUS \u2013\n2020, and SIGN.

Literature suggests thermographs may be able to pick up on pre-\nulcerative (inflammatory) changes several weeks before visible skin changes, thereby allowing the\nidentification of high-risk feet.8\u201310 This modality could then offer an opportunity for regular screening\nby healthcare providers in settings where daily self-monitoring is unreliable. However, determining the\nvalidity of this approach will ideally require prospective on ulcers. Previous randomised controlled\ntrials (RCTs) and prospective studies have provided inconsistent evidence that differing foot\ntemperature distributions among diabetes participants are associated with unique DFU risks. A meta-\nanalysis of five RCTs evaluating interventions of thermography coupled with personalised foot care and\noffloading for participants with hotspots (contralateral feet temperature differences \u2265 2.2 \u00b0C) found\nsome evidence for reduced DFU risk at any foot site (relative risk 0.51, 95% CI 0.31\u2013 0.84).10 However,\nseveral studies mostly included diabetes populations with previous ulcer histories.10 Further, only one\ntrial considered the outcome of foot ulcer development at, or adjacent to a previously identified\nhotspot, and they found no association. 10 We also argue that an RCT design may not be suitable for\nascertaining the predictive capability of plantar thermographs in modelling DFU risk; the observed\nreductions in DFU risk could have occurred merely due to activity reduction even if it were done\nunrelated to any preceding thermographic changes. Only two previous prospective studies found\nthermographic findings could predict DFU with a lead time of 2 \u2013 5 weeks. 8,9 However, one of them\ndemonstrated an impractically high false positive rate of 57%,8 and the other included only a very small\nsample (N= 30 patients) of high-risk diabetes patients with histories of previously healed ulcers.9\nWithout prospective data, it is not possible to directly validate the use of thermography for predicting\n(absolute) DFU risk. Indirectly, however, we can use cross-sectional data to investigate whether plantar\nthermography is associated with classical DFU risk factors. Few previous studies have investigated such\n(predictive) associations. 11 Characterising risk factor severity, especially key ones like neuropathy and\nperipheral arterial disease (PAD) can then be used for risk stratification. Such prediction models would\nlikely have additional clinical benefit; accurate classification into neuropathic and/or ischaemic foot\nwill help tailor limb evaluation. Robust prediction model performances would then support the validity\nof using thermography as a digital biomarker for predicting DFU populations.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to study the validity of plantar thermography as a digital biomarker to identify\npatients at high risk of diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). We limited ourselves to the plantar aspect as the\nliterature shows most DFUs develop on the weight-bearing portions of the plantar aspect of the foot.2\nFirst, we investigate the associations between the intrinsic clusters of plantar thermographic images"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "with DFU risk factors. We do this using an unsupervised deep-learning framework. We trained a\nConvolutional Neural Network Auto Encoder (ConvAE) 12,13 model to extract useful representations of\nfeet-segmented thermographic images. We then applied hierarchical clustering to this dataset of\nthermography representations and explored associations between thermography clusters and DFU risk\nfactors. Second, to identify those associations with predictive power we trained supervised learning-\nbased Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression/classification models14 that predicted the risk\nfactor based on the thermograph (and visual) input.\n\nStudy population\n\nThe details of the APCAPS population have been described elsewhere.15 Briefly, it is a prospective,\ninter-generational cohort based in the 29 villages of Ranga Reddy district in the South Indian state of\nTelangana. For this analysis, we used a subset of diabetes patients with available thermography images\nfrom the latest follow-up in 2022-2023.16\n\nImage acquisition and preprocessing\n\nThermal and corresponding registered visual images of the foot were acquired using the CAT S61\nsmartphone using a (non-insulating) cloth to cover non-foot portions according to the APCAPs data\nacquisition protocol.17 The regions of interest demarcating the two feet in the thermal image were\nsegmented using a CNN with U-Net architecture, models previously shown to have good segmentation\nperformance in biomedical image processing. 18 Two authors CA, and AN created a ground truth dataset\nusing ITK-Snap (version 4.0.2)19 by independently drawing foot contours on a random sample of 60\nvisual images. We created a consensus foot segmentation mask from these two masks using the\nSTAPLE (Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation) algorithm. 20 Then we trained the U-\nNet model to segment bilateral feet from visual images achieving high performance, intersection over\nunion (IoU) score of 0.97. This trained segmentation model was used to obtain binary mask predictions\nfrom all visual images, and by applying these mask predictions to the corresponding registered thermal\nimages, we extracted the thermal images of the feet for downstream analysis. Similar to previous\nstudies, our segmentation model approach used registered visual images instead of direct\nsegmentation on thermal images, as the morphological boundaries of the feet are not well demarcated\nin thermal compared to visual images. 6,21\n\nExtracting image representations\n\nWe built a custom ConvAE model12,13 consisting of an encoder with three layers of 2D CNN layers used\nto extract thermographic image representations that are dimensionally smaller than the original\nsegmented thermal image. The decoder consisted of transposed layers trained to reconstruct output\nsimilar to the original data using representations generated from the encoder. The ConvAE model\ndemonstrated good reconstruction (hold out set, mean squared error: 0.002; mean absolute error:"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "0.01). We then used this trained ConvAE model to extract representations (useful features) from all\nfoot-segmented thermographs.\n\nHierarchical clustering\n\nWe used the 'Ward' method of hierarchical clustering12 to generate clusters within thermographic\nrepresentations. We identified the optimal number of clusters for the dataset using the 'elbow'\nmethod12 and visualised clustering results using t-SNE plots. 13 We report silhouette scores to quantify\nthe quality of clustering. 22 We studied associations between DFU risk factors and thermographic\ncluster assignment using appropriate statistical tests.\n\nPrediction models\n\nFor DFU risk factors that showed strong associations with intrinsic thermography clusters, we\nsupervised-learning-based trained several pre-trained and custom CNN classification/regression\nmodels14 to predict those risk factors based on thermography (with visual image supplementation).\nTheoretically, it was thought that visual images would provide information regarding callosities,\nmacerations between the toes, and foot deformities (including hammer or claw toes) that may aid in\ncharacterising DFU risk.2 As a sensitivity analysis, we trained models to predict the thermography\ncluster based on thermography input. 23 Deep U-Net, ConvAE, and CNN prediction models were all\ntrained using the Adam Optimiser with optimal learning rates identified through learning rate\nschedulers and stopped training when validation set performance metrics failed to show improvement\nin 10 over epochs.\n\nAssociations between thermographic images and DFU risk factors\n\nOur study included 282 participants (aged 56.31 \u00b1 9.18 years, 51.42% males) with type 2 diabetes\nmellitus. Participants had diabetes for 5 (3 \u2013 10) years with the majority never reporting having\nexperienced an ulcer or amputation, 272 (96.45%). ConvAE obtained latent space representation for a\nsample thermograph shown in Figure 1. Hierarchical clustering was performed to visualise the intrinsic\nclusters within thermographs (Figure 2). In Panel A, the dendrogram shows two primary clusters with\nseveral sub-clusters demonstrating the distinct clusters of the ConvAE-generated representations of\nplantar thermographic images. In Panel B, the \"elbow\" point indicates the optimal number of clusters\nto be two. At two clusters the explained variance of the clustering begins to level off and the marginal\ngain of adding additional clusters decreases significantly. In Panel C, we visualise through t-SNE the\ndistribution of the two distinguishable yet overlapping clusters of thermographic representations. In\nPanel D, we show that ConvAE has successfully captured hidden patterns of overlapping\nthermographic phenotypes finding visually discernible groups. However, the silhouette score of +0.10\nsuggests that the obtained clusters are weakly separated, indicating that while some distinct patterns\nare captured, there is still considerable statistical similarity between the clusters."}, {"title": "", "content": "We found compelling evidence for a higher prevalence of DFU risk factors among thermographs\nassigned to cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 (Table 1). This is particularly evident with measures of the\ntwo underlying casual pathologies: peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. mTCNS\nmeasurements which reliably capture the clinical progression of peripheral neuropathy24 were much\nhigher in cluster 1 compared to cluster 2, 6 (2 \u2013 13) vs 3 (1 \u2013 5), p = 3.67 x 10-6. Similarly, TBI measures\nwhich quantify vascular insufficiency in PAD25 (in diabetes populations) were much lower in cluster 1,\n0.83 (0.76-0.92) vs 0.96 (0.87 \u2013 0.99) in cluster 2, p = 5.17 x 107. There was also strong evidence for\nhigher numbers of diabetes complications, and higher measures of composite DFU risk prediction\nscores like PODUS \u2013 2020 (including measures of neuropathy, PAD, and history of\nulceration/amputation), 26 SIGN (similar measures as PODUS \u2013 2020 but additionally including visual\nand physical impairment), 27 and Martins-Mendes (original) scores26 (with measures of neuropathy,\nPAD, number of diabetes complications, and physical impairment) in cluster 1 compared to cluster 2.\nOur findings indicate a convergence between thermographic clusters and variables associated with the\nDFU risk construct.\n\nFurther, we found some evidence for higher minimum foot temperatures and lower foot temperature\nranges, in cluster 1 compared to cluster 2, 30.11 \u00b1 2.93 vs 29.29 \u00b1 2.76, p = 0.02, and 3.54 \u00b1 1.36 vs\n3.99 \u00b1 1.55, p = 0.01, respectively. These results support the trustworthiness of the ConvAE clustering,\nas they indicate that the clusters are indeed capturing the differences in quantitative foot temperature\nmeasurements.

Based on poor model performances in predicting measures of\nneuropathy (regressing mTCNS, or classifying based on mTCNS \u2265 3), or PAD (regressing TBI, or\nclassifying based on clinical history) from thermographs (with or without visual image\nsupplementation), or any of the composite risk scores there is insufficient evidence to support the use\nof plantar thermography for predicting DFU risk factors in populations with majority previously never-\nulcerated diabetes patients.\n\nThere is growing interest in exploring the use of plantar thermography as a digital biomarker for various\nprediction tasks across the spectrum of diabetic foot disease, 4,28,29 including, classifying foot\ntemperature distributions, 30-33 patterns, 34,35 or contralateral asymmetry among diabetes patient\ngroups, 5,6 detection of visibly smaller DFUs,36 predicting the risk of DFU,23,37 monitoring severity and\ntreatment of infections in DFU, 38 and monitoring for DFU recurrence. Several others report advances\nin technical challenges in thermal image acquisition, 39 registration and/or segmentation, 18,40\nautomated temperature difference calculations, and user-testing studies41 all of which are pertinent\nto establishing thermography as a useful digital biomarker. In this study, we aimed to study the validity\nof plantar thermography as a digital biomarker to identify patients at high risk of DFU.\n\nComparison with previous work\n\nOur analysis of cross-sectional data showed strong evidence for associations between intrinsic\nthermographic clusters and several DFU risk factors including casually associated pathologies\nperipheral neuropathy and PAD, and previously validated composite DFU risk prediction scores PODUS\n2020, Martins-Mendes and SIGN. Our findings are in line with the few previous studies (not\nperforming hot/cold stimulus exposure to limbs) that have found some evidence for associations\nbetween thermographic features and measures of neuropathy, 42 or PAD. 11,43,44 Thus, our findings\nsupport the construct validity of using thermography for characterising DFU risk.\n\nInterestingly, none of the associations we examined predicted patients at high risk of DFU. There could\nprobably be two reasons for this: (1) spectrum bias45 owing to a community setting with a relatively\nlower risk DFU population with short diabetes history, few PAD (TBI \u2264 0.71) and a majority of never-\nulcerated patients. Thus the whole spectrum of plantar temperature changes that occur with\nprogressive neuropathy and/or vascular compromise, 46 may not have been represented in our\npopulation; (2) thermography and classical risk factors could be characterising incompletely\noverlapping portions of the DFU risk construct. Theoretically, these measures may relate to DFU risks\nat varying time frames. Peripheral neuropathy and PAD, both chronic pathologies, can individually or\ncollectively contribute to the risk of DFU, resulting in absolute risk estimates of 3.5% to 21% reported\nat 2-year time frames.\u00b3 It is plausible that plantar thermography may measure risk across a different\nor shorter time frame. Very few previous observational studies have developed prediction models\nspecifically for DFU risk using thermographic images. One recent study utilized CNN-based deep\nlearning to classify DFU risk.37 However, their high-risk target class included diabetes participants with"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "active ulceration, which likely drove the very high classification performance (accuracy: 99.4% for\nthermal + visual, 97.6% for visual only on a test set of 31 participants).37 This performance is probably\ndue to the CNN models' ability to distinguish participants with and without visible ulcers, a capability\nthat has been well documented.47 Another study demonstrated strong classification performance\n(accuracy: 92.64%) in predicting PAD risk factor status using thermographic imaging, in a population\nincluding 23 PAD patients (with ABI < 0.9).11 However, their images included lower-leg thermographs\nin addition to plantar thermography.11 One study used an unsupervised thermographic clustering (k =\n3) approach to first subjectively assign each cluster to mild, moderate, or severe DFU risk based on\nphysician review of the thermographs, without detailing the criteria. 23 The accuracy of their models\npredicting cluster assignments (95.08%) was comparable to our sensitivity analysis results on the\nsame. This is expected, as the ground truth labels used are known to be mathematical functions of the\ninput thermography image. Likewise, models classifying thermographs into thermal change index (a\nmathematical function of contralateral feet asymmetry adjusted for healthy control reference ranges)\nclasses have also demonstrated excellent performances.30\u201333 However, none have previously explored\nthe associations between such possible ground truth labels and variables related to the clinical DFU\nrisk construct. We described strong associations between thermography clusters and DFU risk factors\nalthough explored associations did not prove to have predictive value. Taken together, these findings\nhighlight the challenges in identifying appropriate (strongly predictive + clinically relevant) ground\ntruth labels while defining novel digital biomarkers.\n\nStrengths and Limitations:\n\nOurs was the largest thermographic study till date to demonstrate thermographic associations with\nDFU risk factors in the relatively lower-risk group of diabetes patients without previous ulcer histories.\nWe are also among very few studies to successfully demonstrate the feasibility of diabetes foot\nthermographic imaging using smartphones and a low-cost setup (no use of black insulated material\nto block out background temperatures) \u2013 demonstrating the potential for using thermographic imaging\npipelines for diabetes screening in rural/remote lower-middle-income country settings.\n\nImplications\n\nThe findings from our study justify the need for large-scale prospective studies to\n(1) study absolute DFU risks across intrinsic thermographic clusters; (2) inform ideal (in terms of\npredictive efficacy and logistical/economic considerations) thermographic screening interval to\nidentify participants at high risk of DFU; (3) delineate thermographic image patterns and absolute DFU\nricks across a wider disease spectrum including both previously-ulcerated and never-ulcerated\npopulations.\n\nThe strong associations between intrinsic thermography clusters and several DFU risk factors support\nthe validity of using thermography for characterising DFU risk. Obtained associations did not prove\npredictive, likely due to, spectrum bias, 45 or because thermography and classical risk factors\ncharacterise incompletely overlapping portions of the DFU risk construct. Our findings highlight the\nchallenges in standardising ground truths when defining novel digital biomarkers."}]}

{"title": "Improving Faithfulness of Large Language Models in Summarization via Sliding Generation and Self-Consistency", "authors": ["Taiji Li", "Zhi Li", "Yin Zhang"], "abstract": "Despite large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks, they are still\nsuffering from the factual inconsistency problem called hallucinations. For instance, LLMs occasionally generate\ncontent that diverges from source article, and prefer to extract information that appears at the beginning and end\nof the context, especially in long document summarization. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve\nthe faithfulness of LLMs in summarization by impelling them to process the entire article more fairly and faithfully.\nWe present a novel summary generation strategy, namely SliSum, which exploits the ideas of sliding windows\nand self-consistency. Specifically, SliSum divides the source article into overlapping windows, and utilizes LLM to\ngenerate local summaries for the content in the windows. Finally, SliSum aggregates all local summaries using\nclustering and majority voting algorithm to produce more faithful summary of entire article. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SliSum significantly improves the faithfulness of diverse LLMs including LLaMA-2, Claude-2 and\nGPT-3.5 in both short and long text summarization, while maintaining their fluency and informativeness and without\nadditional fine-tuning and resources. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to investigate why\nSliSum works and impacts of hyperparameters in SliSum on performance.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Abstractive summarization aims to generate summaries that are fluent, informative, and faithful to the\nsource articles. Benefiting from the popularity and\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), ab-\nstractive summarization has achieved remarkable\nprogress in fluency and coherence (Zhang et al.,\n2023b; Goyal et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a).\nHowever, LLMs have propensity to generate con-\ntent that contradicts or is not present in the source\narticle (Tam et al., 2023; Maynez et al., 2020; Lin\net al., 2022; Li et al., 2023a), which is commonly re-\nferred to as hallucination. Alleviating the hallucina-\ntion of LLMs is a critical challenge for their reliability\nin real-world applications.\nMany works (Zhang et al., 2023c; Zheng et al.,\n2023) explore the mechanisms why LLMs exhibit\nhallucinations. Liu et al. (2023a) observe that the\nperformance of LLMs significantly decreases as\nthe length of input contexts increases, resulting in\nthe hallucination phenomenon of LLMs being par-\nticularly serious in long document summarization.\nFurthermore, LLMs are sensitive to the order of\ncontext and are more likely to select information\npresented first or last, even for short contexts (Xie\net al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a). That is, the sum-\nmaries generated by LLMs contain more content\nthat occurs at the beginning and end of the source\narticle, which has a detrimental effect on the sum-\nmary quality of the entire article."}, {"title": "2. Related Works", "content": "Factual Consistency of Summarization The\nfactual consistency in abstractive summarization\nhas received increasing attention recently. Existing\nwork has proposed various methods to improve the\nfactual consistency, such as contrastive learning\n(Wan and Bansal, 2022; Xie et al., 2023), adver-\nsarial learning (Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022),\ntextual entailment (Zhang et al., 2022b; Roit et al.,\n2023) and post-editing (Fabbri et al., 2022; Bal-\nachandran et al., 2022). However, these methods\ncan not be directly applied in long document sum-\nmarization due to the difficulty of modeling long\ntexts accurately. Although recent studies have ad-\ndressed this problem by leveraging Graph Neural\nNetworks (Zhang et al., 2022a; Doan et al., 2022;\nPhan et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2022), reinforcement\nlearning (Gu et al., 2022) and structure informa-\ntion (Cao and Wang, 2022; Cho et al., 2022; Pu\net al., 2023), they do not improve the faithfulness\nof long document summarization systems. There\nare currently few works that focus on improving fac-\ntual consistency of long document summarization.\nIn contrast, we propose a unified architecture that\nconsistently improves factual consistency of both\nshort and long text summarization.\nMitigation of LLM Hallucination Recent studies\nhave made several attempts to mitigate the hal-\nlucination of LLMs, including retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (Peng et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023;\nKang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024), post-processing\nmodels (Chen et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2024; Huang\net al., 2023), prompt engineering (Xue et al., 2023;\nShi et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Dhuliawala et al.,\n2023) and self-supervised learning (Gekhman et al.,\n2023; Manakul et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023).

The\nnumber of words in the window only needs to be\napproximately equal to the window size. Figure 1\nshows that LLM generates a local summary for the\ncontent in the sliding window. SliSum restricts the"}, {"title": "3.1. Sliding Generation", "content": "attention of LLM within a window, alleviating the dis-\ntraction issue caused by long contexts (Han et al.,\n2023; Tworkowski et al., 2023). Then the sliding\nwindow moves downward by a distance of step size\nand LLM generates a local summary for current win-\ndow again. Similarly, the distance moved does not\nneed to be strictly equal to step size. That is, the\nstarting index of the window advances a few sen-\ntences. Importantly, SliSum processes the source\narticle at the sentence level. Finally, LLM iteratively\ngenerates summaries for the content in the current\nwindow until the sliding window traverses the entire\narticle. Given an article A = [C1, C2,\uff65\uff65\uff65, Cn], the\nprocess of sliding generation can be described as\nfollows:\nS\u2081 = SUM(W1) = SUM([Cp1,\uff65\uff65\uff65,Cq1])\nS2 = SUM(W2) = SUM([Cp2,\uff65\uff65\uff65, Cq2])\n:\nSm = SUM(Wm) = SUM([Cpm,\u2026\u2026,Cqm])\nwhere SUM(W\u2081) represents LLM summarizes the\ncontent in the window Wi, W\u2081 consists of from pi-th\nto qi-th sentences. P\u2081 = 1, qm = n, and\nPiPi+1qi, i = 1,...,m-1\nEach text segment except the beginning and end\ncan locate in different positions in the context win-\ndow. SliSum balances the position distribution in\nthe context window of text segments, eliminating\nthe position preference of LLMs for source article.\nProcess Repeatedly Eventually SliSum will ob-\ntain a concatenation of summaries [S1, S2,\uff65\uff65\uff65, Sm]\nby sliding generation. In the sliding window method,\nstep size must be less than or equal to window size,\notherwise there will be gaps between windows. Fig-\nure 1 shows that LLM processes the same part of\nthe source article multiple times due to overlaps be-\ntween windows. Generally, given window size Lw,\nstep size Ls (Ls \u2264 Lw) and an article whose length\nLa is far larger than the window size, i.e, La \u00bb Lw,\nthe minimum number of times the middle part of\nthe article is summarized by LLM:\nK =\n\\frac{L_w}{L_s}\n(1)\nIt can be easily seen that if Lw is an integer multiple\nof Ls in sliding window method, LLM will read the\nmiddle part of the source article the same number\nof times, so we set Lw = KLs in SliSum. In partic-\nular, for several windows at the beginning and end,\nwe repeatedly generate local summaries for them\nso that all parts of the source article are summa-\nrized K times."}, {"title": "3.2. Events Filtering", "content": "Lexical Clustering The event is usually com-\nposed of entity, behavior, reason, result and other\nelements, so statements about different events\nhave their own characteristic words that can be\nused to distinguish them. We observe that the\nstatements generated by LLMs for the same event\nare usually lexically similar. Consequently, we can\nobtain a set of sentences about the same event by\nlexical similarity clustering. As shown in Figure 1,\nSliSum divides all summaries into sentences, then\nuses DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996) algorithm to clus-\nter them based on lexical similarity. Specifically, we\nuse ROUGE-1 (Lin, 2004) F1 score to define the\ndistance between two sentences C\u2081 and C2:\ndist(C1, C2) = 1 - R(C1, C2)\n(2)\nwhere R(.) is ROUGE-1 F1 score, and is computed\nas follow:\nR(C1, C2) =\n\\frac{2 * number of overlap words}{length of C1 + length of C2}\nObviously, R(C1, C2) \u2208 [0,1]. There are two im-\nportant parameters in the DBSCAN algorithm: dis-\ntance threshold \u025b and minimum number of points\n(MinPts) in a cluster. Formally, let \u0108 represents\na sentence, if exists a set of sentences (including\n\u0108 itself) C = {C1,C2,\uff65\uff65\uff65,CN} and the number of\nsentences |C > MinPts, every sentence C\u2208C\nsatisfies\ndist(\u0108, C) < \u03b5\nC will be considered a cluster. A lower Min Pts\ninduces the algorithm to construct more clusters,\nwhile a higher MinPts will ensure more robust and\nconsistent clusters.\nFiltering Noise Intuitively, if an event appears\nin the local summary of a window, it means that\nthe event is important to the content in the window.\nWe notice that some sentences are only important\nin minority windows and should not appear in the\noverall summary. Furthermore, LLMs occasionally\ngenerate few hallucination statements that deviate\nfrom the source article. These statements tamper\nwith information in the source article or add informa-\ntion that cannot be inferred from the source article,\nthus they generally have low lexical similarity to\nfactually consistent statements. These undesirable\nstatements are treated as outliers and noise in DB-\nSCAN algorithm. Due to MinPts determines the\nminimum number of points in a cluster, so we can\nfilter out unimportant and hallucination statements\nby using an appropriate MinPts.\nAs mentioned in Section 3.1, SliSum generate K\nsummaries for the content of the source article by\nsliding generation, that is, sentences about the"}, {"title": "3.3. Contradictions Detection and\nSentences Aggregation", "content": "Sentences Selection As shown in Table 1 and\nFigure 1, there may be contradictory statements\nin sentences about the same event. Due to LLMs\nhave ability to detect self-contradictory statements\nwithout relying on additional knowledge (M\u00fcndler\net al., 2024), SliSum first manipulates the LLM used\nin the sliding generation to divide sentences into\ndifferent categories according to their semantics.\nGenerally, the more times a certain response is\noutput by LLMs, the higher the probability that the\nresponse is desirable (Wang et al., 2023b; Manakul\net al., 2023), since self-consistency reflects factual\nconsistency. Consequently, SliSum can utilize ma-\njority voting algorithm to select sentences that are\nfaithful to the source article.\nAfter distinguishing sentences that are high lexi-\ncally similar but semantically different, sentences\nof the same category state the same fact. SliSum\nselects the sentence with the largest proportion\nto output to the final summary. When there are\nclusters of sentences with the same proportion or\nwhen it is necessary to choose sentence from a cer-\ntain cluster, the relatively last generated sentence\nis selected by SliSum. Because the last gener-\nated sentence is located at the beginning of the\ncorresponding window, and LLMs have the highest\nfactual consistency for the information occurs at the\nbeginning of the input context (Ravaut et al., 2024;\nChhabra et al., 2024). For example, an event has\nfive related statements [D\u2081,\uff65\uff65\uff65, D5] generated se-\nquentially, and LLM divides them into [D2], [D1, D4],\n[D3, D5], SliSum selects D5 as the most faithful\nstatement to form the summary of the entire article.\nSentences Integration SliSum finally integrates\nall selected sentences to output the final summary\nof the entire article. SliSum uses LLM to generate\nconnectives and concatenate these sentences in\norder, so that the order of the final summary is\nconsistent with the source article. We determine\nthe order of the sentences according to the order of\nthe events they describe. In the integration stage,\nSliSum do not need to change any information of\nthe selected sentences."}, {"title": "4.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Unmanned Aerial Motors (UAVs), also called drones, are remotely piloted planes that can carry out numerous responsibilities without human intervention. UAVs have been broadly used for surveillance programs in numerous domains, along with army, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. Surveillance is looking at and gathering statistics approximately a target or hobby, along with an enemy, a disaster area, or a natural world habitat. UAVs can provide a decision, actual-time, and continual surveillance capability that could decorate the situational cognizance and choice-making of the customers.\nHowever, the communication challenges of UAV networks, such as limited bandwidth, dynamic topology, and high mobility, pose significant problems in ensuring reliable data transmission well within Limited bandwidth means UAVs must compete for scarce wireless resources to transmit and receive data. The dynamic topology means that UAVs must constantly update their routing information to cope with frequent changes in network connectivity. High mobility means that UAVs have to cope with large variations in link quality and interference from other nodes. These challenges can lead to increased network load, long end-to-end latency, low packet delivery ratio, and low throughput, which can degrade the performance and quality of the monitoring service.\nTherefore, it's far crucial to layout a powerful routing protocol for UAV network surveillance, which can stability the community load, reduce the end-to-cease put-off, and enhance the packet delivery ratio. A routing protocol is a set of policies and algorithms that decide how the UAVs ahead the facts packet to their locations.\nA routing protocol can be classified into two categories: single-route and multipath. An unmarried-route routing protocol selects only one course for each records waft, while a multipath routing protocol selects a couple of paths for every information float. A multipath routing protocol can provide several benefits over a single-path routing protocol, together with load balancing, fault tolerance, and bandwidth aggregation. In this record, we present an powerful load- conscious multipath routing protocol (ELAMR) for UAV community surveillance, which aims to stability the network load, lessen the cease-to-give up delay, and improve the packet delivery ratio. ELAMR makes use of a unique load estimation metric that considers both the queue duration and the variety of packets in transmission at every UAV node. ELAMR additionally employs a multipath creation set of rules that selects the paths with the minimum load and the maximum hyperlink fine. We compare the performance of ELAMR through large simulations and compare it with existing routing protocols. The results show that ELAMR outperforms the prevailing protocols in phrases of network load, end-to-stop postpone, packet shipping ratio, and throughput. ELAMR can be implemented for numerous UAV network surveillance eventualities and offers a reliable and efficient communication solution.\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) face the project of power green records transmission due to the confined battery existence of the sensor nodes. One way to conquer this mission is to use relay nodes that can forward the aggregated records from the sensor nodes to a valuable base station (BS). However, the relay nodes might also have a limited transmission variety and can be unable to establish dependable links with the BS or different relays [1]. Moreover, the relay nodes may additionally devour more strength than the sensor nodes, decreasing the network lifetime.\nTo address these issues, some researchers have proposed to apply a cellular device-to-device (D2D) communique as a relay mechanism for WSNs. D2D conversation allows the devices to talk at once with every other using mobile resources, without going through the BS. This can lessen the transmission distance, decorate the hyperlink fine, and improve the spectral performance [2]. Furthermore, D2D verbal exchange can offer dual connectivity, which means that the devices can use both mobile and D2D links simultaneously, which could increase the reliability and robustness of the community [1].\nThe research under review describes a cellular D2D-assisted relay communication strategy for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in which data is forwarded to the base station (BS) by the cluster heads (CHs) of sensor nodes via D2D relays [3]. The Maximum Weight Bipartite Matching method is used by the proposed strategy, DSPA (D2D Relay Node (DRN) Selection and uplink Power Allocation), to choose the best DRNs for each CH based on the channel gain and the residual energy of the DRNs [4]. Next, taking into account the interference from other pairings as well as the DRNs' energy usage, the strategy allows the uplink power for every CH-DRN pair. In comparison to alternative schemes, the authors demonstrate that their suggested method can increase the energy efficiency, hop gain, and network longevity of the WSNs [5].\nOther related works on D2D relay verbal exchange for WSNs encompass [Social Reliable D2D Relay for Trustworthy Paradigm in 5G Wireless Networks], wherein the authors use social relationships amongst devices to shape private accept as true with and to select dependable relays; [Energy-Efficient Power Allocation and Relay Selection Schemes for Relay Assisted D2D Communications in 5G Networks], where the authors suggest schemes for electricity allocation and relay choice, based totally at the sign-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the electricity harvesting functionality of the devices; and [Relay Selection-Based Energy Efficiency of Hybrid Device To-Device Enabled 5G Networks], wherein the authors introduce a hybrid relay community version that uses reactive and proactive relay choice strategies to enhance the electricity efficiency of the network [6].\nThis review summarizes the main conclusions of a recent study on power regulation and cooperative UAV channel modeling for 5G IoT networks. In a 5G IoT scenario where numerous UAVs work together with cellular base stations, this study investigates the communication problem [7]. It focuses on uplink channel modeling and the investigation of uplink transmission performance. The effects of multi-UAV reflection and 3D distance on wireless signal propagation are considered in the channel model [8]. The three-dimensional distance is used to determine the path loss, which is a more realistic representation of the actual path loss. The UAV's uplink transmit power is modified using the power control factor to account for differences in propagation route losses in order to achieve precise power management [1].\nOne of the tasks we have in mind is figuring out the optimal UAV grid topology with the shortest drone range for video monitoring over an unreachable area without cellular coverage. This study acquired zero blind spots during surveillance by utilising the concept of the subject of view (FOV) of the onboard camera [4]. Additionally, a wireless community for the UAV grid was established. Each UAV had a Raspberry Pi installed, and the inter-UAV distance was fixed primarily on the basis of excellent quality of experience (QoE) and ideal packet loss for streaming videos. It verified that the video streaming QoE is lower than allowable thresholds at 4\nThe goal of the work on an energy-efficient UAV surveillance scheme that makes use of the compressive sensing (CS) concept is to minimize the overall energy consumption of the UAV network while meeting the surveillance quality requirement [10]. This is achieved by formulating the UAV surveillance problem as a joint optimization problem of UAV trajectory design and CS measurement matrix design. Through simulations, it proved the efficacy of their plan and used the alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem."}, {"title": "III.

Using these metrics, a drone graph is constructed, wherein nodes represent drones and edges signify communication links. The SNR values on the edges determine the strength of potential connections."}, {"title": "V.

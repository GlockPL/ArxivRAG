{"title": "Representation Bias of Adolescents in AI: A Bilingual, Bicultural Study", "authors": ["Robert Wolfe", "Aayushi Dangol", "Bill Howe", "Alexis Hiniker"], "abstract": "Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a risk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the epistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two countries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would prefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs), comparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and Nepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal problems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers in the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about teenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss societal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness, and sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less dominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents and N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from teenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship. Participant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated from SWE associations, with Pearson's p=.02, n.s. in English FastText and p=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and p=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and p=-.23, n.s. in GloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by highlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity. Participants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than media sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes. Our work offers an understanding of the ways SWEs and GLMs misrepresent a developmentally vulnerable group and provides a template for less sensationalized characterization.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Teenagers feature more prominently in western media accounts of new technologies than perhaps any other user group. They are the group most likely to adopt and capably use new technologies, including social media (Vogels and Gelles-Watnick 2023) and ChatGPT (Klar 2023). However, to read media accounts, they are also the most likely to misuse new technologies, leading to harm to others, or inadvertent harm to themselves (Stern and Burke Odland 2017). Such narratives have consequences for adolescent access to technology: concerns about compulsive use of social media, cyberbullying, and sexual predation led to a March 2024 ban on use of numerous social media platforms by younger teenagers in the state of Florida (The Guardian 2024). Concerns about deceptive design and online safety warrant consideration; yet the response-a blanket ban-suggests a framing that emphasizes the danger of adolescent technology use and affords adolescents little agency.\nSuch presentations continue a decades-long trend in western media portraying teenagers as simultaneously a risk to society and at risk from society (Pain 2003). Though largely disconnected from most adults' experiences with teens (Aubrun and Grady 2000), media portrayals of adolescents have centered violence, drug abuse, hyper-sexualization, technology addiction, and even religious fanaticism as pressing issues that warrant responses ranging from targeted media campaigns to government legislation (Clark 2005; Marwick 2008; Glassner 2010; Telzer et al. 2022). Though such portrayals appear sensationalistic in hindsight, representations of teenagers in media sources nonetheless shape adults' beliefs about what adolescents are like, influencing the treatment of adolescents in public places (Bernier 2011) and the restrictiveness of policy intended to influence adolescent behavior (Dorfman and Schiraldi 2001), thus directly affecting how teens are treated in practice.\nIn the present work, we study societal attitudes toward adolescents learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs), comparing with attitudes reported by adolescents themselves. Because prior work suggests attitudes toward adolescents vary across cultures (Larson and Wilson 2004; Di Giunta et al. 2023), we undertake a bilingual, bicultural study, examining U.S. attitudes and English-language models, as well as models trained on Nepali, a low-resource language spoken primarily in Nepal, a South Asian country in the Global South, and a native language for a first author of this work. We held workshops with N=13 English-speaking adolescents in the U.S. and N=18 Nepali-speaking adolescents in Nepal, asking how adolescents are represented in media, and how they should be represented in AI.

News coverage of teenagers often depicts supposed epidemics of violence, crime, drug abuse, mental illness, and immorality, which are usually not well supported by evidence (Glassner 2010; Telzer et al. 2022). In foundational work, Dorfman et al. (1997) find that most California TV news reports related to violence feature youth, and that only education policy receives as much treatment as violence in newspaper coverage about adolescents. Males (1999) find that LA Times articles included adolescents in stories about violence five times more frequently than adults. Adolescent behavior may be presented as dangerous even when not volitional, as Best (2008) find that activities as simple as teenage driving can be framed as pressing issues in the media. More recently, teenage use of technology has become a subject of public concern, and Stern and Burke Odland (2017) find that print and online news media portray teens as having an unhealthy relationship with social media. Previously, Stern (2005) found that U.S. films depict teenagers as violent, self-absorbed, and disengaged from civic life.

Hancock (2001) shows that adults overestimate and perceive illusory increases in adolescent crime. Aubrun and Grady (2000) find most adults report good experiences with teenagers they know but consider such experiences atypical, rather than questioning media framing. Dorfman and Schiraldi (2001) note that negative media portrayals, especially of adolescents of color, lend justification to harsher treatment and more restrictive policies. Moreover, Qu et al. (2020) find that younger teens' own beliefs in teenage stereotypes contribute to behavioral problems. Buchanan et al.

Arnett (1999) note that adolescent stress may be more pronounced in individualistic western cultures, while Larson and Wilson (2004) use the plural form \u201cadolescences\" to describe variations around the world and across time, noting that teen years are not consistently characterized by emotional turmoil and psychic separation from parents. Finally, Di Giunta et al. (2023) observe differences in emotion regulation in teenagers in Italy and Colombia, suggesting cultural factors play a role in adolescent well-being."}, {"title": "Language Models", "content": "In this work, we study static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs). SWEs are trained using deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent words as vectors based on the conditional probability of their co-occurrence with surrounding words (Mikolov et al. 2013; Collobert et al. 2011). We study FastText (Bojanowski et al. 2017), an extension of Word2Vec (Mikolov, Yih, and Zweig 2013) that incorporates subword information, and Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014), which incorporates corpus-level statistics to improve semantics. SWEs are now widely used in social science (Bhatia and Walasek 2023; Guan et al. 2024) to study societal attitudes (Garg et al. 2018), because the cosine distance between word vectors captures information about semantic similarity (Hill, Reichart, and Korhonen 2015). GLMs are DNNs based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) that learn to predict the next token (word or subword) (Radford et al. 2018). GLMs allow users to interact with a model by \"prompting\" it-providing text input for continuation by the model (Brown et al. 2020). Models like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) fine-tune a pretrained GLM to follow user instructions and adhere to user preferences (Ouyang et al. 2022). We study GPT2 (Radford et al. 2019), the last GLM released publicly by OpenAI and the most-downloaded GLM in the Transformers library (Wolf et al. 2020), and Meta's LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al. 2023), an open-weight model from which dozens of open-weight chatbots have been trained (Chiang et al. 2023; Taori et al. 2023; Wolfe et al. 2024). We avoid proprietary models like ChatGPT due to uncertain reproducibility of results from models for which weights are unavailable (Liesenfeld, Lopez, and Dingemanse 2023)."}, {"title": "Low-Resource Languages", "content": "Nepali is a \"low-resource\" language, meaning that much less text data exists for training Nepali NLP models than other languages (Besacier et al. 2014), and model performance is likely to lag behind that of higher-resource languages such as English (Ranathunga et al. 2023). While a multilingual model may improve performance in a low-resource language (Scao et al. 2022), its representations may also take on semantic properties and biases of a higher-resource languages (e.g., English) (Zhao et al. 2020; Ramesh, Sitaram, and Choudhury 2023). Thus, our work requires monolingual technologies to ensure we capture semantic properties of the intended language, rather than the semantic influence of a higher-resource language."}, {"title": "Age Biases in AI", "content": "Research on age biases in AI describes technical failures of technologies like emotion recognition for older adults (Kim et al. 2021), precipitated by underrepresentation in training data (Park et al. 2021).

Most similar to our work are studies of biases in multimodal language-vision models. Agarwal et al.

(2018) on Nepali Wikipedia.\nFastText embeddings like FastText-NE are among the most used low-resource models for social science (Lindqvist, Pettersson, and Nivre 2022). We trained a Nepali GloVe embedding after considering several pretrained Nepali embeddings, including the NPVec1 model of Koirala and Niraula (2021), the Nepali Word2Vec model of Lamsal (2019), and the model of Subedi and Poudyal (2023). We ultimately trained an embedding on the dataset of Timilsina, Gautam, and Bhattarai (2022) because it contained three times the data (800 million tokens from 2.76 million Nepali webpages) as used to train any other model, allowing us to produce an embedding more comparable in scale to English-language GloVe. Our training hyperparameters adhered closely to best practices for GloVe.\nWe also study the following pretrained GLMS:\n\u2022 OpenAI GPT2-XL, an English-language GLM trained on OpenAI's WebText dataset (Radford et al. 2019).\n\u2022 Meta LLaMA-2-7B, an English-language GLM trained on public datasets including The Pile (Gao et al. 2020).\n\u2022 DistilGPT2 Nepali, an open-weight, reduced-parameter version of GPT2 pretrained on the nepalitext dataset, which consists of Nepali text from the CC100 (Wenzek et al. 2020) and OSCAR (Ortiz Suarez, Sagot, and Romary 2019) datasets, as well as Nepali Wikipedia.\nWe use 4-bit quantization (Dettmers et al. 2024) to mount LLaMA-2-7B on affordable GPU hardware.

Given an embedding vocabulary V, we define an Adolescent target group A.\nA, Teenager: teenager, teenagers, teen, teens, teenage, teenaged, adolescent, adolescence\nTo obtain the most associated words with A, We compute the mean cosine similarity $s = \\frac{\\Sigma_{a \\in a} cos(\\tilde{w}, a)}{A}$ for every word vector $\\tilde{w}$ corresponding to a word $w \\in V$, and select the words with the 1,000 largest values of s.\nTo obtain the highest frequency words uniquely associated with A, we use a Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test (SC-WEAT) (Caliskan, Bryson, and Narayanan 2017; Caliskan et al. 2022) to compare the relative similarity of a word w to two attribute groups A and B:\n$d(w, A, B) = \\frac{meana\\in Acos(w, a) \u2013 meanb\\in Bcos(w, b)}{std\\_dev\u2208AUBcos(\\tilde{w}, F)}$\nThe SC-WEAT returns an effect size (Cohen's d) and a p-value based on a permutation test. Unlike some SC-WEATS, which define A and B based on two poles of a binary (e.g., Male/Female), Teenager has no clear opposing pole for B. Thus, we define three B groups using the age ranges specified by the NIH: Children (B1), Adults (B2), and Older Adults (B3):\n\u2022 B1, Children: child, children, childlike, childhood, kid, kids, schoolchild, schoolchildren\n\u2022 B2, Adult: adult, adults, adulthood, middle-age, middle-aged, grownup, grown-up, grownups\n\u2022 B3, Older Adults: aged, aging, older, old-age, elder, elders, elderly, retiree\nFor every word $w \\in V$, an SC-WEAT is taken between A and $B_1$; A and $B_2$; and A and $B_3$. We select only words that exhibit large, statistically significant effect sizes with A when compared with all three of $B_1$, $B_2$, and $B_3$. Formally, let $W_1$ denote the words w in V such that d(w, A, $B_1$) > 0.8, p < .05; $W_2$ the words such that d(w, A, $B_2$) > 0.8, p < .05; and $W_3$ the words such that, d(w, A, $B_3$) > 0.8, p < .05. That is:\n$W_1 = \\{w \\in V | d(w, A, B_1) > 0.8, p < .05\\}$\n$W_2 = \\{w \\in V | d(w, A, B_2) > 0.8, p < .05\\}$\n$W_3 = \\{w \\in V | d(w, A, B_3) > 0.8, p < .05\\}$\nWe select the words $W_A$ exhibiting a large, significant effect with Adolescent over Children, Adults, and Older Adults:\n$W_A = W_1 \\cap W_2 \\cap W_3$\nWe then select from $W_A$ the 1,000 most frequently occurring words in the corpus that produced V, a straightforward task because SWEs are rank-ordered based on word frequency.

To recruit U.S. participants, we used a contact list of parents who indicated their willingness to be contacted by our university regarding enrolling their children in research. We sent one email to individuals whose children met our inclusion criteria, then called them once at the phone number provided. To recruit Nepalese participants, a relative of the first author residing in Kathmandu posted recruiting flyers at two Kathmandu high schools. We collected signed assent forms from participants and signed consent forms from their parents. U.S. participants received $25 Amazon credit. Because Amazon does not operate in Nepal (nor does any equivalent), we compensated participants in Nepal via direct payment equal to $7.50 USD in Nepalese Rupees, after consulting a relative of the first author living in Nepal regarding exchange rate to ensure we did not bias participant responses (Millum and Garnett 2019).\nWorkshop All workshops took place over Zoom during December 2023 and January 2024. Participants could choose a synchronous or asynchronous format. With exception of a session wherein two participants asked to join a workshop together, we conducted workshops individually to allow participants more opportunities to ask questions. Sessions began with a five minute, story-based introduction to how AI learns language-for example, by guessing the next word in a sentence, or arranging words based on their similarity to each other. Participants were then asked to help AI learn about teenagers, which involved the following tasks:\n\u2022 Write the top ten words that come into your head when you hear the word teenager.\n\u2022 Write ten words that only describe teenagers, and do not describe children, adults, or older adults.\n\u2022 Complete the sentence with a few words, using the GLM prompts provided in Table 1.\n\u2022 Rate 20 traits on a scale from 1 (most similar) to 5 (least similar) based on how well they describe teenagers.\n\u2022 Provide the AI with instructions on how to discuss teenagers fairly (both accurately and without bias).\nParticipants were asked to write about whether and why AI should learn about teenagers from teenagers themselves, rather than media sources. Finally, we engaged in dialogue with synchronous participants to answer their questions about AI. Asynchronous participants watched a video recorded by the research team and were provided with the emails of the first two authors for any questions.

We selected the number of clusters (between 5 and 10) using Silhouette Score (Rousseeuw 1987). The first two authors then individually reviewed the clusters and assigned labels (e.g., a cluster containing Justin, Morgan, etc., was assigned First Names). The authors then met to discuss and formalize labels into initial codes. The authors then applied the codes to the GLM outputs. Where an output did not belong to any existing code, it was added to an Other category. After coding the output of each GLM, the authors met to review outputs classified as Other, and decided whether to add new codes. The authors discussed output on which they did not agree and either resolved the code in discussion or added it to the Other category if agreement was not reached. Multiple codes were applied to an output if appropriate.\nNext, the authors applied the codes to participant workshop data, adding codes as needed and keeping track via memos of how participant responses differed from model outputs. The authors sequentially reviewed the word similarity, prompt continuation, and instructions for AI fairness data, meeting to discuss and resolve differences after each phase of coding. All data was coded in Google Sheets, and each author was provided with separate copies of model and participant data so that the authors could not see each other's codes before discussion. The Nepali-speaking first author translated Nepali content and provided guidance where the meaning of a translation was uncertain. After arriving at a final hierarchy of 40 codes with 10 top-level codes such as Teen Experiences and Law and Crime, the authors reviewed all model and human materials again, refining code assignments as appropriate.\nThe authors then met three times to arrive at themes describing the findings. During the first meeting, the authors used affinity diagramming to visualize proposed themes that were shared across languages and data sources (model or human) and those which were distinct across languages and sources. After this meeting, the authors wrote memos describing the proposed themes. The authors shared the memos and discussed them in the second meeting to arrive at the final themes.

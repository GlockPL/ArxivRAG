This paper focuses on the development of an ML model with high predictive accuracy to classify arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The ECG signals datasets utilized in this study were sourced from the PhysioNet and MIT-BI\u041d databases. The research commenced with binary classification, where an optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model yielded excellent results in differentiating normal and atrial fibrillation signals. A pivotal aspect of this research was a survey among medical professionals, which not only validated the practicality of Al-based ECG classifiers but also identified areas for improvement, including accuracy and the inclusion of more arrhythmia types. These insights drove the development of an advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system capable of classifying five different types of ECG signals with better accuracy and precision. The CNN model's robust performance was ensured through rigorous stratified 5-fold cross- validation. A web portal was also developed to demonstrate real-world utility, offering access to the trained model for real-time classification. This study highlights the potential applications of such models in remote health monitoring, predictive healthcare, assistive diagnostic tools, and simulated environments for educational training and interdisciplinary collaboration between data scientists and medical personnel.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as one of the prominent contributors to global morbidity, presenting a significant health challenge worldwide [1], [2]. The onset of potentially fatal cardiac conditions is often marked by arrhythmias, making them critical early warning indicators. Developing and implementing a robust predictive model capable of accurately detecting these arrhythmias could profoundly impact health outcomes. Through early detection and intervention, it holds the potential to substantially mitigate the casualty rates associated with heart diseases [1]- [4].\nAn Electrocardiogram (ECG) visualizes the heart's electrical activity, with key components being the P, Q, R, S, and T waves, as shown in Figure [1]. The P wave signifies atrial contraction, the QRS complex represents ventricular contraction, and the T wave corresponds to ventricular relaxation [5].\nThe most critical ECG signal parts and parameters for diagnosing cardiac conditions such as arrhythmias are the QRS complex, ST segment, and PR, RR, and QT intervals. An arrhythmia, essentially an irregular heartbeat rhythm, results to the changes in these ECG waveforms, with atrial fibrillation (Af) being one of the most common types [6], [7]. Numerous techniques can be used for the exploration of ECG signals, such as time-domain-based techniques, frequency domain-based techniques, time frequency-based analysis (TFA), time-fractional frequency domain techniques, and nonlinear [8]-[10]. Multiple research efforts have been conducted to apply machine learning models for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias using ECG signals with promising"}, {"title": "II.

TRAINING AND TESTING DATASET", "content": "Two different datasets, PhysioNet Challenge 2017 and MIT-BIH arrhythmia, were considered for binary classification using MATLAB and multilevel classification using CNN, respectively. The PhysioNet Challenge 2017 contains 8528 ECG recordings, sampled at 300 Hz, mostly 30 seconds long and some were up to 60 seconds, containing each signal classified as either normal rhythm or atrial fibrillation, one of the most common arrhythmias. It can be identified by the missing P block in the PQRST waveform and often causes irregular heartbeat.\nThere was also the presence of a notably very small number of other noisy signals that were not classified, and thus, were removed from the dataset, resulting in a decrease in the total number of signals. After truncating long signals to make it 30 seconds, 5655 total numbers with a 7:1 normal to abnormal ratio were obtained. A resampling technique was used to balance this ratio in the dataset. The 'sym4' wavelet was used for QRS detection and artefact removal, enabling the detection of morphological features like R-R intervals, distance between R peaks and heart rate. Other features like spectral entropy and instantaneous frequency, which were affected by the missing P waves, were explored using MATLAB's signal processing toolbox. The prepared dataset was split into 9:1 training to testing data ratio.\nThe 1D CNN model was considered for multilevel classification and the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset was obtained from the PhysioNet website [16]. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database directory is a set of over 4,000 long-term recordings from a medical instrument called Holter obtained in the Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) arrhythmia laboratory. The samples were obtained from 25 men and 22 women aged 23 to 89. These readings were taken from two leads, lead II and lead VI, of a 12-lead ECG system. The signals were digitized with a sampling frequency of 360 Hz. After pulling the dataset, the PQRST wave was extracted by comparing the beats with 'sym4' signals and using wavelet coefficients. All these signals and their respective annotation were stored as a data frame. The data frame consisted of 5 types of signals annotated as N (Normal beat), L (Left bundle branch block"}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "content": "Exploration and analysis of the morphological features of ECG signals, such as peak-to-peak distance, heart rates and number of QRS complexes over a window of samples, visually distinguished the normal ECG signals and the abnormal ones (the ones with atrial fibrillation). In the window of 1200 samples, the number of QRS complexes observed was hovering between 4 and 6 in the normal signals, which yielded a heart rate between 60 bps and 90 bps. The peak-to-peak distances were relatively similar in normal signals but anomalous in atrial fibrillation. Heart rate and number of QRS complexes in the atrial fibrillation signals significantly deviated from those values of normal signals. Two more features, instantaneous frequency and spectral entropy, were extracted using MATLAB's signal processing toolbox. After training the build Bi-LSTM model, training and testing accuracy of 94.64% and 92.44% were obtained respectively.\nIn evaluating model performance, confusion matrices from all the folds were combined to create a consolidated"}, {"title": "V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The integration of machine learning systems in interactive healthcare services has the potential to revolutionize the industry and enhance medical diagnostic capabilities. Medical professionals' express enthusiasm for implementing such models, signaling a promising future for AI-driven healthcare solutions.\nThis paper is focused on exploring and developing multiple machine learning models for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification to facilitate the detection and classification of arrhythmias. The investigation showed that the Bi-LSTM model outperformed other conventional models like Decision Tree Classifier, Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier and Neural Network in binary classification. Bi-LSTM could achieve remarkably high accuracy in binary classification or arrhythmia detection. After identifying and visualizing the morphological features effectively, the initial Bi-LSTM achieved satisfactory accuracy in binary classification. The opinion survey of medical professionals on the performance and applicability of ML-based detection and classification systems following the initial results supported the practicality of this kind of system. Meanwhile, the experts highlighted the traits and provided feedback to improve the system's performance. Following the suggestions, a more robust model, CNN, was used for multiclass-level classification of arrhythmias. This stratified-5-fold cross-validation employed model yielded highly acceptable results in accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure for classifying the normal ECG signals and four types of arrhythmias. This tool can potentially become a valuable diagnostic asset for medical personnel with further enhancements.\nIn conclusion, the successful development and validation of ML models for ECG signal classification underscore the potential for the widespread adoption of such technologies in the healthcare industry. As the integration of artificial intelligence advances, more sophisticated models in computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems can be anticipated."}]}

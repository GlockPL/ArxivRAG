The development of synthetic imaging techniques, particularly synthetic computed tomography (sCT), continues to attract interest in radiotherapy. The SynthRAD2025 dataset and the accompanying SynthRAD2025 Grand Challenge aim to stimulate advancements in synthetic CT generation algorithms by providing a platform for comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of synthetic CT generation algorithms based on cone-beam CTs (CBCT) and magnetic resonance images (MRI).\nThe dataset comprises 2362 cases, including 890 MRI-CT pairs and 1472 CBCT-CT pairs of head-and-neck, thoracic, and abdominal cancer patients treated at five European university medical centers (UMC Groningen, UMC Utrecht, Radboud UMC (Netherlands), LMU University Hospital Munich, and University Hospital of Cologne (Germany). Images were acquired using a wide range of acquisition protocols and scanners. Pre-processing, including rigid and deformable image registration methods, was performed to ensure high-quality image datasets and alignment between modalities. Extensive quality assurance was performed to validate image consistency and usability.\nAll imaging data is provided using the Metalmage (.mha) file format, ensuring compatibility with common medical image processing tools. Metadata, including acquisition parameters and registration details, is available in structured comma-separated value (CSV) files. To ensure dataset integrity, SynthRAD2025 is split into training (65%), validation (10%), and test (25%) sets. The dataset is accessible through https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14918089 under the SynthRAD2025 collection.\nThis dataset enables benchmarking and development of synthetic imaging techniques for radiotherapy applications. Potential use cases include sCT generation for MRI-only and MR-guided photon and proton radiotherapy, CBCT-based dose calculations, and adaptive radiotherapy workflows. By incorporating data from diverse acquisition settings, SynthRAD2025 supports the advancement of robust and generalizable image synthesis algorithms for clinical implementation, ultimately promoting personalized cancer care and improving adaptive radiotherapy workflows.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Over the last decade, advancements in image-guided and adaptive radiotherapy have significantly improved treatment outcomes for cancer patients, partially due to the introduction of image-guided (daily) adaptive photon and proton radiotherapy [1]. These approaches rely on accurate imaging to account for anatomical and physiological changes throughout treatment, enabling precise dose delivery to tumor volumes while sparing surrounding healthy tissues [2]. Computed tomography (CT) imaging remains the gold standard for treatment planning, offering the electron density information critical for accurate dose calculations [3]. However, frequent CT imaging is time-consuming and costly, has an additional imaging dose burden for patients, and is usually unavailable directly on radiotherapy delivery machines [4].\nTo address these challenges, alternative imaging modalities such as cone-beam CT (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasingly used to replace CT acquisitions during treatment [5,6]. Compact CBCT systems can be easily integrated with treatment machines, providing volumetric patient images, and have become standard for daily pre-treatment patient alignment [7,8]. However, CBCT image quality is usually inferior to diagnostic fan-beam CT quality, mainly due to increased scatter and other CBCT imaging artifacts, which prevent the use of CBCT images for accurate dose calculations [9,10]. Recent advancements in clinically available CBCT hardware and software have enabled direct dose calculations in photon radiotherapy [25], although this approach is not yet widely adopted.\nMRI, on the other hand, offers superior soft-tissue contrast and functional imaging capabilities without ionizing radiation. However, direct dose calculations on MRIs are impossible due to the lack of electron density information required for dose calculation algorithms [11]. Still, there is an increasing interest in MR-only radiotherapy workflows [26], and although more technically challenging to realize than compact CBCT systems, MR-Linacs have proven that MRI can be efficiently combined with treatment machines and enable daily MR-guided online adaptive photon radiotherapy [12]. The combination of a treatment machine and an MRI is more challenging for proton therapy due to the interaction between magnetic fields and proton beams; however, research and development are ongoing, and MR-guided proton therapy might become clinically available [13].\nThe image quality limitations of CBCT and the absence of electron density information in MRI have sparked interest in generating so-called synthetic CTs (sCT) from CBCT and MRI data to enable accurate dose calculations. Beyond generating electron density maps for dose calculations, sCTs have also proven valuable in facilitating organ-at-risk and target volume auto segmentation [23, 24]. Numerous studies highlight artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, as one of the most promising approaches for synthetic CT generation [5]. However, a lack of public datasets for CBCT and MR-based synthetic CT generation makes a fair and meaningful comparison of deep learning-based synthetic CT algorithms challenging. In 2023, the first edition of the SynthRAD challenge, SynthRAD2023, addressed this by providing the first large-scale public multi-center dataset to comprehensively compare synthetic CT generation in brain and pelvic patients [13, 14]. The SynthRAD2025 challenge and dataset build upon the success of the SynthRAD2023"}, {"title": "2 Acquisition and Validation Methods", "content": "2.1 Dataset overview\nThe SynthRAD2025 dataset is part of the second edition of the SynthRAD deep learning challenge, which focuses on benchmarking MRI- and CBCT-based synthetic CT generation solutions (https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/). Similar to the previous SynthRAD2023 challenge [14, 15], SynthRAD2025 is structured into two tasks: Task 1 addresses MRI-to-CT conversion for MR-only and MR-guided photon and proton radiotherapy; Task 2 focuses on CBCT-to-CT translation for daily adaptive radiotherapy workflows. The SynthRAD2025 challenge dataset provides data for synthetic CT generation in head-and-neck, thoracic, and abdominal cancer patients. Imaging data was collected at radiation oncology departments of five European university medical centers, three from the Netherlands: UMC Groningen, UMC Utrecht, and Radboud UMC, and two from Germany: LMU University Hospital Munich and University Hospital of Cologne.\nThis study has been independently approved by all centers in accordance with the regulations of their respective institutional review boards or medical ethics committees. The dataset comprises 2362 cases, where 890 are MRI-CT pairs for task 1 and 1472 are CBCT-CT pairs for task 2. The only inclusion criteria for the SynthRAD2025 challenge datasets were treatment with some form of external beam radiotherapy (photon- or proton-beam therapy) at one of the data-providing centers and available imaging data from one of the respective anatomical regions. There were no further limitations on age, sex, or tumor characteristics, e.g., type, size, location, and staging. Due to the large dataset size, we have collected a representative sample of patients treated at these radiation oncology departments. Datasets for head-and-neck, thorax, and abdomen subsets were mainly collected based on imaging protocols used in the respective region and institution. Due to this selection, patients from one region were occasionally imaged with the imaging protocol of other regions, e.g., abdomen patients imaged with thorax protocol might be present in the thorax training dataset. However, only patients whose target volumes belonged to the respective anatomical region were selected for the test and validation sets.\nIn some centers, access to detailed patient characteristics was limited due to ethical considerations of data privacy and anonymization, preventing detailed statistics about age and sex distribution in the dataset. Figure 1 presents exemplary images for each task and anatomical region. For SynthRAD2025, the dataset was split into a training, validation, and test set, aiming at a split of 65/10/25%, respectively. However, this may slightly vary depending on data availability per center, task, and anatomy. To ensure the integrity of the SynthRAD2025 challenge, initially, only the training dataset will be released publicly (details see section 3.2)."}, {"title": "2.2 Task 1", "content": "Centers A, B, C, and D provided data for task 1, which comprises a variety of image scanners and acquisition protocols. MRIs from centers A, C, and D were acquired for treatment planning, mainly for defining target volumes.

Image acquisition systems and parameters for MRIs and CTs are presented in Table 2. The data provided by Center C was acquired for diagnostic purposes with a small FOV and different immobilization devices, which makes this dataset specifically challenging for synthetic CT generation.

For a subset of patients included in the testing phase of SynthRAD2025, radiotherapy treatment planning structures were exported and preprocessed. These structures are not included in the released dataset. Following the raw data export, the preprocessing pipeline involved the following key steps."}, {"title": "2.4.1 Rigid registration", "content": "MRIs and CBCTs were rigidly registered to their corresponding planning CTs using the Elastix registration framework [16].

This algorithm utilizes TotalSegmentator (version 2.3.0) [17], a deep learning-based CT auto-segmentation model, to segment the skull and brain. Using these structures, the facial region was identified on the central sagittal slice of the brain mask by extracting the most anterior voxel of the brain (indicated by the yellow marker in Figure 2) and generating a bounding box around the skull mask. The anterior-inferior corner of this bounding box was selected as the lower boundary of the face (see blue marker in Figure 2). The facial region was then defined as all voxels to the left of the line connecting these two points and was overwritten with the background intensity value (-1024 for CT and 0 for MRI). The algorithm demonstrated strong robustness against patient positioning and orientation changes and did not require manual corrections. Figure 2 provides a visualization of the defacing process."}, {"title": "2.4.3 Resampling", "content": "To standardize image resolution across the MRI, CBCT, and CT datasets, all images were resampled with a consistent voxel spacing of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3 mm."}, {"title": "2.4.4 Outline Segmentation", "content": "For each patient case, an outline mask was generated on the MR/CBCT image to define the volume used for evaluation and metric calculations during the validation and testing stage of the SynthRAD2025 challenge. This mask was created automatically using histogram-based thresholding, followed by morphological erosion and dilation operations. The threshold value varied between centers' anatomical regions and had to be manually tuned for some patients. The final mask was dilated further to include surrounding air, ensuring that synthetic CT models accurately reconstruct the patient outline rather than relying on the mask itself. The automated process can result in minor inaccuracies and variable dilation margins for some patients. Given the large dataset size, manual corrections of masks were not feasible."}, {"title": "2.4.5 Cropping", "content": "To minimize file and dataset size, patient images were cropped to a 10 pixels-extended bounding box of the patient outline mask (described in Section 2.4.4)."}, {"title": "2.4.6 File conversion", "content": "Images were compressed and saved in the Metalmage format for the final datasets with the \".mha\" extension.

This step reduced anatomical differences between synthetic and ground-truth CTs. Deformable image registration was performed using the Elastix framework [16], and parameter files are publicly available in the source code. To avoid bias towards paired training approaches, deformed CTs are not provided for the training dataset and will only be released as part of the validation and testing dataset for SynthRAD2025."}, {"title": "2.5 Data validation", "content": "The SynthRAD2025 dataset was designed to provide a representative sample of radiotherapy patients sourced from multiple international radiation oncology departments. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad, including patients with even image artifacts or implants, provided the images were deemed suitable for synthetic CT generation. The dataset was validated by focusing on image and preprocessing quality checks, with particular emphasis on the accuracy of the defacing algorithm to ensure patient anonymity and prevent re-identification. Therefore, all datasets underwent visual checks by the respective institutions to ensure proper removal of facial features.\nFurther quality assurance involved generating overview images containing central axial, sagittal, and coronal slices from CBCT/MRI, CT, and the patient outline mask. These overviews also included overlaid CBCTs/MRIs and CTs to assess registration accuracy visually. It is important to note that these overviews are unsuitable for image intensity quantification due to inherent differences in intensity and contrast between imaging modalities. However, they are distributed as part of the SynthRAD2025 dataset (Section 3.1). The large dataset volume limited the quality checks to three planes per image and patient.\nAvailable Image acquisition parameters were extracted as is from the original Dicom files and are provided for each dataset in .xlsx files. The selection of patient cases for training, validation, and test sets was guided by the availability of organs-at-risk (OAR) and target structures and the accuracy of deformable image registration, which was visually assessed for all patients.\nDuring the visual control, the following observations were made: 1) In some cases, the position of the arms varied between MR/CBCT and CT acquisitions. 2) Image artifacts, such as those caused by metal implants, were present in a limited number of cases. 3) Depending on the definition of anatomical regions and imaging protocols in each center, some thoracic cases are included in the abdominal dataset and vice versa. 4) Variations among patients affected the automatic thresholding process for the definition of the body mask, resulting in the possible inclusion of couch structures or the exclusion of lung regions. As a result of the automatic thresholding and the varying thresholds used, the final dilation margins around the patient outline are different among patients and dataset. 5) The 1HN subset of center C included MRIs with a limited field of view, making rigid and deformable registration particularly challenging. These cases may be challenging for synthetic CT (sCT) generation. 6) Patient outline masks in subsets 1AB and 1TH of center B were cropped in the inferior-superior direction due to varying MRI intensities and frequent artifacts at the edge of the FOV. In some cases, the cropped mask still includes artifacts, or the cropping might remove regular slices."}, {"title": "3 Data Format and Usage Notes", "content": "3.1 Data structure and file formats\nFigure 3 presents the directory structure of the SynthRAD2025 training dataset.

The rigorous automatic preprocessing pipeline followed by manual quality control ensures high-quality and standardized data, including rigid registration, defacing, resampling, and outline segmentation. The separation into two separate tasks, addressing MRI-to-CT and CBCT-to-CT conversion, allows researchers to focus on specific challenges associated with each modality, such as the lack of electron density in MRI or the artifacts in CBCT, individually.

Furthermore, even within the centers, imaging protocols and scanners often vary, limiting the number of datasets with homogenous image characteristics. This heterogeneity makes it challenging to develop universally applicable sCT generation algorithms.\nDue to ethical considerations and data privacy concerns that vary among countries and centers, detailed patient characteristics, e.g., age, sex, tumor type, and staging, are not uniformly available across the dataset. This limits the ability to perform subgroup analyses or evaluate algorithm performance in specific patient populations over the whole dataset. Whenever possible, patient characteristics were included in the metadata files.\nAlthough the preprocessing pipeline was designed to harmonize the data, some steps, such as resampling, defacing, and outline segmentation, may partially deteriorate the data quality. For example, while robust, the automated defacing algorithm may occasionally remove non-facial structures, and the patient outline masks may have variable dilation margins or include structures outside the patient, e.g., the treatment couch.\nDeformed CTs are not provided for the training dataset in the SynthRAD2025 challenge to avoid bias toward paired deep learning training approaches. While this ensures a fair evaluation of synthetic CT algorithms, it may limit the ability to train models that rely on deformable image registration and require extra steps from the dataset user to perform deformable registration and validate its results.

This includes evaluating these algorithms' computational efficiency, robustness against outliers and artifacts, and clinical feasibility in real-time treatment scenarios. While the series of SynthRAD datasets and accompanying challenges already covers five anatomical regions (brain, head-and-neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis), future iterations could further expand the datasets to include additional regions, such as extremities, special patient populations, e.g., pediatric patients, or extend to other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and PET. This would further enhance the dataset's applicability to a broader range of clinical scenarios."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "The SynthRAD2025 dataset is a resource for the radiotherapy research community.

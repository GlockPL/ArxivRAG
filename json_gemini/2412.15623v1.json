However, it remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to induce harmful outputs. Exploring jailbreak attacks enables us to investigate the vulnerabilities of LLMs and further guides us in enhancing their security. Unfortunately, existing techniques mainly rely on hand-crafted templates or generated-based optimization, posing challenges in scalability, efficiency and universality. To address these issues, we present JailPO, a novel black-box jailbreak framework to examine LLM alignment. For scalability and universality, JailPO meticulously trains attack models to automatically generate covert jailbreak prompts. Furthermore, we introduce a preference optimization-based attack method to enhance the jailbreak effectiveness, thereby improving efficiency. To analyze model vulnerabilities, we provide three flexible jailbreak patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailPO not only automates the attack process while maintaining effectiveness but also exhibits superior performance in efficiency, universality, and robustness against defenses compared to baselines. Additionally, our analysis of the three JailPO patterns reveals that attacks based on complex templates exhibit higher attack strength, whereas covert question transformations elicit riskier responses and are more likely to bypass defense mechanisms.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited surprising advancements in generalization capabilities and are widely adopted in various applications (Ge et al. 2024). Despite the impressive potential demonstrated by LLMs, there is growing concern about their tendency to generate objectionable content, including hate speech, illegal suggestions, and misinformation. LLM jailbreaks (Zhang, Pan, and Yang 2023; Deng et al. 2024; Yi et al. 2024), aiming to bypass the safeguards of aligned LLMs and fool them into generating objectionable content, have been identified as one of the most critical security risks for LLM applications (Fasha et al. 2024). Therefore, it is crucial to examine jailbreak attacks to explore LLMs' potential and security boundaries with expositions of current LLMs' security risks.\nExisting jailbreak explorations rely on achieving empirical success by crafting laborious adversarial prompts for specific targets with handcrafted templates (Li et al. 2023b; Liu et al. 2023; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023) or generated-based token optimization (Zou et al. 2023; Jones et al. 2023). Unfortunately, handcrafted attacks, with notable effectiveness, pose scalability issues with the ever-expanding LLMs, while generated-based methods are primarily for white-box LLMs, which might be impractical under black-box usage. Besides, existing methods suffer from high computation costs due to numerous LLM queries by adversarial prompts. Therefore, there is a demand for a scalable, universal, and cost-effective jailbreaking framework to examine LLM alignment.\nTo address these problems above, we pose the following research question: Is it feasible to automatically generate efficient and universal jailbreak prompts? We initiate our investigation with preliminary experiments to analyze the jailbreak capability of LLMs and the quality of handcrafted attacks. Our findings yield two insights: 1) LLMs possess the potential to learn and generate effective jailbreak prompts. 2) the attack effectiveness varies across different handcrafted templates. This motivates us to explore the possibility of inducing LLMs to create more effective jailbreak prompts.\nFrom our observations, we propose a novel preference optimization-based jailbreak framework, JailPO, to automatically jailbreak that only requires black-box access with a few queries. To enhance scalability and universality, two powerful attack models are employed to independently generate covert jailbreak questions and templates, avoiding human intervention. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a preference optimization method within attack models to improve their comprehension of the jailbreak. Specifically, the scoring strategy based on the jailbreak detector is utilized to construct pairwise preference datasets and attack models are trained using Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) (Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023) on these datasets. Additionally, we present distinct attack patterns to flexibly assess the vulnerabilities of LLMs. Consequently, our JailPO achieves outstanding performance on attack effectiveness, efficiency, universality and robustness against two popular defenses. Furthermore, attacks based on complex templates more easily bypass model alignment, while attacks involving covert question transformation provoke"}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "LLMs are language models with massive parameters trained on web-scale data (Touvron et al. 2023; Achiam et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2023). Currently, the emergent capabilities of LLM that are absent in smaller-scale models (Bommasani et al. 2021) have garnered significant attention. However, to protect internal details, commercial LLMs are primarily provided through API calls and online services (Yang et al. 2024), which means users typically cannot access the model's internal structure. Hence, we focus on the LLM that learns by predicting the next token with black-box access.\nLLM Alignment is a nascent research field that aims to align models' behaviors with the expected intentions (Wang et al. 2023; Ji et al. 2023; Shen et al. 2023). To prevent responding to malicious instructions, LLMs typically incorporate safeguards during training. Recent efforts have employed reinforcement learning methods for LLM alignment (Ouyang et al. 2022) to ensure that LLM outputs adhere to human values. Additionally, preference optimization (Rafailov et al. 2024; Azar et al. 2024; Ethayarajh et al. 2024) is introduced to optimize reinforcement learning goals for more streamlined and stable training. In this work, we present attacks to jailbreak these safety alignments. To our knowledge, preference optimization, primarily used for alignment, has not been applied to jailbreak attacks.\nLLM Jailbreaks construct strategically crafted inputs to LLM with the intent to bypass alignment and deceive them into generating objectionable content (Xu et al. 2024; Azar et al. 2024). Specifically, early efforts (Perez et al. 2022) focus on exploring weaknesses in existing LLM alignment measures. Techniques using unique data formats like encrypted methods (Yuan et al. 2023) and low-resource languages (Deng et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2023; Yong, Menghini, and Bach 2023) have shown the potential to circumvent the LLM alignment. Inspired by training gaps, handcrafted methods comprise attacks conducted through manually crafted predefined templates (Liu et al. 2023; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023) such as role-playing (Li et al. 2023a) and scenario crafting (Li et al. 2023b), which are notably effective (Schwinn et al. 2023). Unfortunately, handcrafted methods face scalability challenges. It is not only prone to circumvention and increases in labor burdens but also difficult to quickly update for new LLMs, re-"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In this section, we describe the general framework of JailPO, which comprising three components: a core optimization algorithm, two attack model construction, and three jailbreak patterns.

Following previous work (Xu et al. 2024), the ROBERTa-based detector ClassJudge is employed as the primary detector for jailbreak attacks. ClassJudge is a binary classification model that assesses whether a response y correctly answers the prompt p, denoted as S(p, y). A correct response is marked as 1, otherwise, it is 0. In this work, we assume that the adversary has black-box access to an LLM where they can only input queries and obtain textual responses."}, {"title": "Preliminary Experiments", "content": "Jailbreak Attack Potential in LLMs. Inspired by previous work (Deng et al. 2024; Wen et al. 2023) on intricate semantic transformations, we explore whether LLM can gen-"}, {"title": "Jailbreak Preference Optimization", "content": "Based on our preliminary investigation, we introduce key aspects of the method that we will leverage to convert effective prompts, including two steps as illustrated in Figure 2.\nSupervised Fine-Tuning. We fine-tune a model to enhance its comprehension of jailbreaks. Due to the limited size of available datasets in both the jailbreak question and template, following work (Zou et al. 2023), we leverage a self-instruction methodology for data augmentation. The core idea is to make the open-source LLM, which is available for training, align with the capabilities of the advanced black-box commercial LLMs. Therefore, given an origin query set D = {x} and Instruction I, we first collect the supervised learning dataset $D^* = \\{\\{x,y\\}\\}$ as follows: for each query x, we employ instruction I to automatically generate the corresponding response y based on GPT-3.5 zero-shot prompting. Then we fine-tune the base model $\\pi_i$ by training it on $D^*$ to obtain a fine-tuned model $\\pi_f$, laying the foundation for more precise adjustments.\nOptimize Model against Preference. To further teach the model to create more effective jailbreak prompts, SimPO (Meng, Xia, and Chen 2024) is introduced for additional fine-tuning. Typically, the fine-tuned model is used to construct a preference dataset, which is then employed for further fine-tuning to improve the model's ability to recognize the characteristics of effective jailbreak prompts.\nSpecifically, for the original query set D, detector Class-Judge classifies high-quality responses and constructs the"}, {"title": "Jailbreak Preference Optimization", "content": "preference dataset $D_p = \\{\\{x, Y_w, y_l\\}\\}$, where $y_w$ and $y_l$ represent preferred and dispreferred completions, respectively. To acquire preferred response pairs, we input each query x into the fine-tuned model $\\pi_f$ to generate n corresponding response $y_f = \\{Y_1, Y_2,\\cdot, Y_n \\}$. By querying aligned LLM $M_a$ (we use Llama2-7B in our experiments) with $Y_i \\in y_f$, we employ detector to assess the jailbreak prompt quality of $y_i$:\n$Score(y_i) = \\sum S(y_i, query(M_a, Y_i))$  (1)\nWhere I represents the number of queries. For $y_i$ and $y_j$ in $y_f$, we assign preference labels based on the jailbreak success scores: $Y_w = y_i$ and $y_l = y_j$ if Score($y_i$)>Score($y_j$); otherwise, assign $y_w = y_j$ and $y_l = Y_i$.\nAdditionally, we learn a reward function on the preference dataset. The length-normalized reward using the likelihood of the generated sequences is as follows:\n$r(x,y) = \\frac{\\alpha}{|y|} \\sum log (Y_i | x, y < i)$ (2)\nWhere $\\alpha$ is a constant that controls the scaling of the reward difference. Then using the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry 1952) to model preferences, the preference distribution $p^*$ can be expressed as:\n$p^*(x, Y_\\omega, \\psi_\\iota) = \\sigma(r(x,y_w) - r(x,y_l) - \\beta)$ (3)\nThe target reward margin B helps differentiate between preferred and dispreferred responses, and $\\sigma$ is the logistic function. Preference optimization can be framed as binary classification, where the model $\\pi_f$ can be optimized directly through negative log-likelihood loss:\n$\\mathcal{L}(\\pi_f) = -E_{(x, y_w, y_l)~D_p}[logp^*(x, y_w, y_l)]$ (4)\nWith the above steps, we obtain an enhanced model $\\pi_e$ to generate efficient and scalable jailbreak prompts."}, {"title": "Enhanced Model Construction", "content": "Inspired by the described algorithm, we outline our pipeline for two attack models."}, {"title": "Question Enhanced Model (QEM)", "content": "Our goal is to fine-tune LLM to generate covert jailbreak questions that bypass model alignment. We collect 522 questions (Deng et al. 2023; Yu, Lin, and Xing 2023; Yuan et al. 2023; Deng et al. 2024) as the question origin query set $D_q$. Due to the limited number of questions, GPT-3.5 is employed to rephrase the query set, creating more complex expressions to enrich and diversify this set. For each question q, we generate 10 variations. Besides, combining questions and their variations into a supervised learning dataset $D^*$, we use questions as input and prompt the model to predict more complex and nuanced expressions. Such a strategy not only enables the model to better understand the questions but also improves its predictive ability in the context of jailbreak attacks. By fine-tuning model $\\pi_i$, the question fine-tuned model $\\pi_f$ is acquired.\nIn order to apply preference optimization to this question-enhanced setting, we employ $D_q$ to query model $\\pi^\\xi$, obtaining 10 responses for each question. Using the scoring strategy in Eq. 1, a question preference dataset is constructed with 6000 preference pairs. This dataset guides the model to generate higher-quality jailbreak questions.

It contains 520 questions that request harmful content such as misinformation, profanity, and dangerous suggestions. Please note that our test questions are distinct from the training set.\nModels. To ensure the generality of the results, we consider three widespread popular open-sourced LLMs and a close-sourced LLM for our major evaluation, including 7B parameter Llama2, 7B parameter Mistral, 7B parameter Vicuna and GPT-3.5. All tested LLMs have been safety-aligned to effectively reject harmful user instructions. In addition, 7B parameter LLama2 serves as the base model to instantiate our attacks.\nBaselines. We compare JailPO with five SOTA methods. For handcrafted attacks, we choose four advanced black-box methods: SelfCipher (Yuan et al. 2023), DeepIception (Li et al. 2023b), TemplateJailbreak (Liu et al. 2023), and Jailbroken (Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023). For generative-based attacks, we use the pioneering method GCG (Zou et al. 2023), which automates jailbreak prompt generation through token-level optimization with white-box access. To ensure fairness in the assessment, GCG model is trained in a white-box setting on Llama2 and its performance is then evaluated across other target LLMs.\nEvaluation. Two evaluators are employed to assess the attack result for subsequent steps automatically, determining whether a positive response is generated for the attack.

We conduct these evaluations by generating a jailbreak prompt for each harmful question in the dataset and testing the final responses from the target LLM. Table 1 shows that JailPO consistently achieves or approaches the optimal performance in ASR on both evaluators.

This underscores the performance enhancement driven by the preference optimization strategy. Among the target LLMs, Mistral proves the most vulnerable, with JailPO achieving 55.67% ASR on ClassJudge. Meanwhile, on closed-source GPT-3.5, despite its strict defense mechanisms, JailPO achieves a 15.23% ASR with one query. Additionally, TemplatePrompt shows an average higher attack effectiveness of 4.38% and 4.82% on ClassJudge compared to QEPrompt and MixAsking, indicating that incorporating scenarios helps induce positive responses. However, we observe on Vicuna that the semantic complexity of templates leads to incomprehension, resulting in irrelevant answers.\nEfficiency.

We use Llama Guard (Inan et al. 2023) to assess high-risk content in generated responses, assigning a score from 0 to 9 based on vigilance level, with scores above 4 classified as high-risk. More high-risk content indicates a more severe jailbreak threat. In Figure 4, QEPrompt generates the highest average of high-risk content at 30.92%, followed by MixAsking at 25.69% and SelfCipher at 25.60%. Notably, incorporating templates may decrease high-risk response detection on target LLMs, except for Llama2 which benefits from preference optimization. QEPrompt with direct question transformations significantly outperforms TemplatePrompt by more than 2 times, demonstrating that in attacks without relying on complex scenario inducements, the response can be significantly riskier.\nPerformance against Defense Strategies. We evaluate our method and the baselines against two advanced defense mechanisms: Perplexity (Alon and Kamfonas 2023; Jain et al. 2023) and LLM-Guard (ProtectAI 2023). Perplexity sets a threshold based on requests from the AdvBench dataset, rejecting any input message that exceeds this perplexity threshold. In contrast, LLM-Guard is a popular open-source project designed to filter out toxicity inputs and outputs. As demonstrated in Figure 5, QEPrompt shows outstanding performance on both defense mechanisms, markedly surpassing other methods, where DPR for the Llama2 and Mistral against the LLM-Guard are nearly 100%. This indicates that the covert questions generated by models conforms to normal semantic expressions while evading toxicity detection.

Additionally, TemplatePrompt, built upon the TemplateJailbreak templates, achieves an average 14.15% DPR improvement on LLM-Guard. This is attributed to preference optimization, which enhances models capability to bypass toxicity detection. Finally, MixAsking integrates both patterns, resulting in a balanced performance.\nAnalysis of JailPO Patterns. Our experimental results reveal the following key insights: QEPrompt focuses on eliciting covert expressions of questions, demonstrating an 18.64% advantage over TemplatePrompt in generating high-risk outputs. Moreover, it is easier to bypass existing defense mechanisms. By contrast, TemplatePrompt, by integrating complex scenarios, exhibits significant attack effectiveness. For instance, on Mistral, this method achieves a success rate exceeding 50% with only one query iteration, as shown in Table 1. This suggests that current LLMs still exhibit weaknesses in their safety alignment mechanisms when confronted with complex scenarios. Moreover, the combined patterns MixAsking leverages both methods, significantly enhancing QSR with only a modest increase in the number of queries, As illustrated in Tables 1 and 2. This hybrid method balances the strengths of both individual patterns in terms of generating high-risk outputs and countering defensive measures, demonstrating cost-effectiveness."}, {"title": "Further Validation for JailPO", "content": "Ablation Studies.

In particular, our observations indicate that QEPrompt achieves a 15.36% improvement in ASR on the Llama3-70b compared to the 7B parameters Llama2. This suggests that alignment performance tends to deteriorate with increasing model size, likely due to an inherent conflict between alignment objectives and generative capabilities. Additionally, for GPT-4 and Command-R, TemplatePrompt attacks significantly outperform QEPrompt attacks, highlighting current threat posed by complex scenarios to alignment. Consistent with previous analysis, QEPrompt is effective at inducing LLMs to generate more high-risk content.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that JailPO outperforms other baselines in efficiency, universality and robustness against defenses across different settings. For JailPO patterns, we find that jailbreak attacks with templates are easier to bypass model alignment, compared to covert questions, but their response is less risky and more easily detected by the defense.

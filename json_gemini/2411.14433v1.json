This study investigates the application of industrial digital twins (DTs) in education, focusing on how DT models of varying fidelity can support different stages of Bloom's taxonomy in the cognitive domain. We align Bloom's six cognitive stages with educational levels: undergraduate studies for \"Remember\" and \"Understand,\" master's level for \"Apply\" and \"Analyze,\" and doctoral level for \"Evaluate\" and \"Create.\" Low-fidelity DTs aid essential knowledge acquisition and skill training, providing a low-risk environment for grasping fundamental concepts. Medium-fidelity DTs offer more detailed and dynamic simulations, enhancing application skills and problem-solving. High-fidelity DTs support advanced learners by replicating physical phenomena, allowing for innovative design and complex experiments. Within this framework, large language models (LLMs) serve as mentors, assessing progress, filling knowledge gaps, and assisting with DT interactions, parameter setting, and debugging. We evaluate the educational impact using the Kirkpatrick Model, examining how each DT model's fidelity influences learning outcomes. This framework helps educators make informed decisions on integrating DTs and LLMs to meet specific learning objectives.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "DIGITAL Twin technology was originally conceptualized in the aerospace field as a digital counterpart of a physical system and benefits from information interaction with entities, allowing virtual models to map corresponding behaviors in virtual space through online status updates. Due to the demand for advanced monitoring, diagnosis, and prediction within industrial systems and the development driven by Industry 4.0, using digital twins to integrate data from various sensors and IoT devices can achieve highly complex real-time simulations. These simulations reflect the physical systems and predictive capabilities that enable industrial system optimization, fault detection, and lifecycle management. Coupled with the development of machine learning technology in the field of artificial intelligence, the capabilities of digital twins have been further enhanced, allowing dynamic adaptation and improving the accuracy of predicting system behavior under different conditions, and its application in manufacturing, aerospace, energy, and other industries has increased efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness.\nGiven the proven benefits of digital twin technology in industry, its potential in industrial education to solve human resource development issues is becoming increasingly apparent. Digital twins can serve as powerful experiential learning tools in education to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. This potential is particularly relevant when viewed through Bloom's taxonomy [1]. Bloom's taxonomy is a framework that divides educational goals into levels, from lower-order cognitive skills, such as memory and comprehension, to higher-order skills, such as analysis, evaluation, and creation. This study aligns the different fidelity levels of the digital twin with the different educational stages of Bloom's taxonomy, providing a new approach to curriculum design in engineering education for different needs. That is to say, the complexity and fidelity of the digital twin model can be tailored to the cognitive needs of the educational stage.\nAt the undergraduate level, where the focus is on acquiring fundamental knowledge and basic skills, low-fidelity digital twins can provide simplified representations of industrial systems. While low-fidelity digital twins cannot simulate precise system behavior, these models are adequate for tasks involving the core principles of \"remembering\" and \"understanding.\" Low-fidelity digital twins can enable students to engage in fundamental aspects of system operation without being overwhelmed by the complexity of high-fidelity simulations, causing additional learning confusion. Features of these models may include basic manufacturing processes, simplified machine operations, or basic control systems that are sufficient for introductory courses in engineering and related disciplines.\nAs students advance to the postgraduate level, especially master's programs, the educational focus shifts to \"applied\" and \"analytical\" knowledge. At the master's level, medium-fidelity digital twins become more appropriate. Enable students to"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Digital twin technology originated from aerospace engineering and was proposed by NASA to enhance the design, monitoring, and maintenance of complex systems for space vehicles in 2010 [2]. The concept of digital twins is system engineering based on simulation. However, what is different from the offline simulation is that in addition to the physical model, it also includes online sensor updates and historical data as input to the model to mirror the ultra-realistic corresponding physical system behavior [3]. Moreover, in response to the need for universality, modern digital twins can reflect physical behavior, and user-friendly visualization is an integral part of them. Constructing the appearance of a physical system and transforming it into an intuitive and operable interface is becoming a core challenge in the development of digital twin technology [4].\nWe illustrate the concept of modern digital twins in Figure 1. Actual equipment operates in physical space and uses sensors to collect data on physical behavior to provide continuous information input to the virtual space. In virtual space, the digital twins are built with varying fidelity levels to mirror the system accurately at different levels, process the data obtained from the physical space, and generate behavior output or feedback control to send it back to equipment in physical space, enabling real-time adjustments and optimization. The interoperability of these two spaces can be seen as the coupling of digital twins with physical systems and is metaphorically explained by the components of the human body: the \u201cbone\" represents the physical system; the \"muscle\" symbolizes the behavior model of Digital Twin, responsible for simulating dynamic interactions and driving the physical system; and the \u201cskin\u201d serves as the visualization layer, which translates complex data into user-friendly, intuitive interfaces. The seamless coupling of these elements ensures the interoperability of digital twins with physical systems, enhancing monitoring, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency across various applications.\nModeling physical behavior to establish accurate virtual models and building the appearance of a physical system to transform it into an intuitive and operable interface are becoming core challenges in developing digital twin technology. In constructing a behavioral model of digital twins, it is not easy to rely on traditional numerical models to model complex systems, but with the mature development of machine learning technology and computing power, using machine learning technology to model physical behavior has become the primary option [5, 6]. Machine learning can reduce the complexity of digital twin modeling, and this advantage allows digital twin technology to play a role in various fields [7]."}, {"title": "B. Digital Twin in Education Application", "content": "In industrial education, the complexity and cost of industrial environments cause the challenge of workforce training. Using digital twins for industrial education to respond to workforce development needs has become a potential option and has attracted attention [8]. Digital twins can be used as a training tool, allowing learners to conduct ultra-realistic personalized training through the virtual and real combination of digital twins and factory environments, and can greatly improve resource optimization and operational efficiency [9]. Lei et al. proposed a web-based digital twin training environment for communication maintenance and power systems training[10]. They used optical fiber fault repair as an example to teach students how to understand the actual before and after repair situations through the digital twin. Moreover, Mart\u00ednez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al. proposed in 2023 the use"}, {"title": "III. DIGITAL TWIN EDUCATION FRAMEWORK", "content": "This educational framework is based on the Multi-Fidelity Digital Twin and combines different educational levels, Bloom's Taxonomy, and the Kirkpatrick models, as illustrated in Figure 2. These four elements are intertwined to present a comprehensive learning and assessment approach that uses digital twins to meet industrial education goals and provides an educational process from primary understanding to advanced creation while also considering learning outcomes and behavior change.\nIn this framework, the six levels of the cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy are Remembe, Understanding, Application, Analysis, Evaluate, and Create, which correspond to different stages of education Undergraduate, Master, and Doctoral degrees. As learners progress through the educational stage, their learning goals shift from memorizing and understanding basic knowledge to higher-level like analysis, evaluation, and creation. In the educational needs of different stages, multi-fidelity digital twins can become an educational tool, providing reasonable learning assistance for different educational levels and making educational goals at different stages successful.\nThe application of multi-fidelity digital twin technology in education closely relates to the educational goals mentioned above. Low-Fidelity Digital Twins are usually constructed from simple 3D models and animations. They are suitable for use in the early stages of education to help students understand basic concepts and arouse interest in learning. When undergraduate students enter the workplace or graduate school, they will have the basic knowledge to meet their employment or research needs. In the stage of the Master's degree, the Medium-Fidelity Digital Twin can provide virtual commissioning, behavioral simulations, and rule-based automation that help students apply and analyze their learning. At the highest level of education, the doctoral degree, High-Fidelity Digital Twin, covers real-time interaction, machine learning predictive analysis, multi-model interoperability, etc. These technologies support creative thinking and in-depth evaluation.\nIn evaluating students' learning effectiveness, we introduce the Kirkpatrick model [15] into the framework, which can ensure a comprehensive evaluation of students' learning effectiveness at different educational levels. At the undergraduate level, using low-fidelity digital twins, the emphasis is on the first level: reaction, focusing on how students perceive the training, its relevance to their future careers, and their participation in the learning process.

It equips learners with the necessary tools and knowledge to be successful in modern industrial environments by providing a scalable and interactive platform that evolves alongside the student's educational journey. In addition, we integrated a Generative AI-based tutor to evaluate the learning, and we used the Kirkpatrick model to assess students' learning status through a customized LLM.

This high-fidelity Digital Twin includes advanced features such as AI-driven analytics, real-time data integration, and cybersecurity protocols[19]. The high-fidelity model is tailored to support the cognitive processes of \"Evaluating\" and \"Creating,\" critical for doctoral research and innovation. Within this environment, doctoral students can design and test new industrial processes, develop custom APIs, and explore the full potential of Industry 4.0 technologies, thereby contributing to the advancement of intelligent manufacturing methodologies.\nTo address these challenges, we leverage the power of generative AI. In the context of Industry 4.0, constructing flexible digital twin behaviors is a significant challenge, involving high training data costs and behavior changes over time. Recent advancements have shown that LLMs can effectively forecast time series data without extensive training[20]. By dynamically adjusting LLM inputs based on historical and real-time measurements, we can generate time series data that closely approximates the physical system's behavior over time. This adaptive modeling capability allows the high-fidelity Digital Twin to continuously learn and refine its predictive algorithms, minimizing the need for large, costly datasets.\nIn Figure 6, we implement a dynamic time series prediction method within the high-fidelity Digital Twin using a few-shot learning approach with LLMs. This enables real-time system adjustments based on evolving industrial processes.

Users can interact with the virtual tutor, ask questions, and operate the machine. The virtual tutor will continuously monitor the learner's input and the machine's response to evaluate performance, provide feedback, make suggestions for improvement, and make up for deficient knowledge.\nWe achieve this goal by integrating LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology[21] and Prompt En-gineering[22]. RAG technology allows the model to retrieve relevant information from external databases before generating answers, thereby enhancing the model's knowledge base, especially when addressing specific technical issues. The virtual tutor can provide more accurate and particular guidance by establishing a database that includes various machine operation guides, troubleshooting methods, and frequently asked questions.

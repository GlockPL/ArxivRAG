If data is the foundation\nfor much contemporary human existence, then it is increasingly important to address how that\ndata is made accessible and managed. Addressing the risks and tradeoffs-and\nopportunities\u2014surrounding data governance has become one of the most pressing public policy\ntasks of our times, with important decisions to be made at every link in the data value chain.\n\nData governance is a multi-threaded challenge; solutions and appropriate governance\nframeworks will include multiple steps, mechanisms, and institutions. In what follows, we focus on\none particularly important aspect of the data governance landscape: the role and functions of\ndata stewardship.\n\nData stewardship is a term increasingly used in the context of modern data governance,\npotentially offering solutions or mitigating mechanisms for better management of digital assets.\nYet it is also a term that is fraught with ambiguity, its definition and scope often contested. For\ndata stewardship to evolve into a viable solution, we need a much better understanding of what it\nmeans, and be more specific when using the concept.\n\nThis essay aims to provide clarity by exploring different manifestations of data stewards and the\nnotion of data stewardship. In particular, we aim to advance our understanding of data\nstewardship by examining four manifestations of the notion:\n\n1. a set of competencies and skills;\n2. a function or role within an organization;\n3. an intermediary organization; and\n4. a set of principles.\n\nAfter discussing these various manifestations, we focus on the intersection of data stewardship\nwith Al. Finally, we conclude by exploring some remaining challenges and areas for further\nexploration. Our overall goal is to provide a conceptual, relevant, and practical framework to help\nunderstand and advance the functions of data stewards in a twenty-first-century datafied era."}, {"title": "Data Stewardship as a Set of Competencies and Skills", "content": "Data stewardship is a broad concept that encompasses many competencies and skills. At a high\nlevel, the responsibility of a data steward is to ensure end-to-end responsibility throughout the\ndata value chain-collection, storage, handling, use, and reuse of data. In addition, one of the\ncentral goals of data stewardship is to break down data silos (e.g., in privately held datasets) and\ncreate public value by fostering inter-sectoral collaborations and reusing data and data expertise.\n\nThese high-level goals and principles can be broken down into five more specific competencies\nand skills:\n\n1. Stewarding Data: Data Audit, Assessment & Governance: Stewarding data assets for the\npublic interest involves formulating and determining priority questions, scoping and\niterating on assessments of \u201cminimum viable\u201d data needed, identifying and documenting\ndata assets, and considering ethical and fundamental rights implications. It also includes\nestablishing operational, technical, and governance models to measure impact.\n2. Stewarding Relationships: Partnership and Community Engagement: This competency\ninvolves stewarding relationships by reaching out to and vetting potential partners while\ninforming beneficiaries of insights generated from data initiatives. Data stewards act as\npoints of contact for data re-use, engage stakeholders in user-driven processes, and help\nestablish a social license for data re-use through community deliberations and\nagreements.\n3. Stewarding Internal Resources: Internal Coordination and Data Operations: Data\nstewards must gain approval and coordinate with internal actors, ensuring all"}, {"title": "The Function or Role of Data Stewards Within Organizations", "content": "What do these various principles and competencies mean in practice? For organizations\nconsidering appointing data stewards, questions remain about how they fit into overall\norganizational charts, what their specific responsibilities may be, and how they might interact with\nother groups or individuals that already handle data. In particular, there may be some ambiguity\nabout potential overlap between the roles of existing Chief Data Officers (CDOs) and data\nstewards. Below, we seek to clarify some of these points of potential confusion by providing a\nroadmap for companies and other entities considering appointing data stewards.\n\nCurrently, individuals or groups in organizations tasked with managing data typically have four\nkey responsibilities:\n\n1. Data Custodian: Managing data storage and security.\n2. Compliance Officer: Ensuring adherence to legal and ethical standards.\n3. Data Strategist: Aligning data practices with organizational goals.\n4. Data Facilitator: Bridging technical and non-technical teams.\n\nThese roles are not necessarily assumed by data stewards (although they may come into contact\nwith some of these tasks). Instead, the responsibilities may continue to be assigned to existing\nindividuals or entities, most commonly Chief Data Officers. The GovLab has advocated for a more\nstrategic role for Data Stewards, one that would complement the functions of CDOs. Both\npositions are integral to strategic data management and governance within organizations, but\nthey serve distinct functions:\n\n\u2022 Chief Data Officers (CDOs) are primarily responsible for the overarching governance and\nutilization of data as a strategic asset within organizations. Their duties often encompass\ndata management, privacy, security, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.\nThe role is typically inward-facing, focused on optimizing data processes and policies to\nenhance organizational efficiency and decision-making."}, {"title": "Data Stewardship as an Intermediary Function", "content": "Among the most important functions of data stewards is to build and maintain collaborations and\npartnerships. As such, one of the key manifestations of data stewardship is that of an\nintermediary function. Data stewards perform this function between and among multiple\nstakeholders in the data ecology-data holders and users, private sector data \"owners\u201d and\nthird-party public or civil society groups seeking to repurpose the data, and more. These data\ncollaboratives can take different forms including data trusts, data cooperatives, data altruistic\norganizations or data commons. Among the chief desired outcomes of this function is to enable\nprivately held data to be responsibly and ethically repurposed for the public good.\n\nThe intermediary function can be broken down into three roles:\n\n1. Trusted Intermediary: Acting as a neutral entity that ensures data is (re)used responsibly\nand equitably.\n2. Negotiator: Facilitating digital self determination and the creation of agreements on data\nreuse, such as access rights and usage limitations."}, {"title": "The Principles of Data Stewardship", "content": "Finally, in considering the various manifestations of data stewardship, it is important to consider\nsome of the underlying principles that guide its approach to data and data handling. At a broad\nlevel, the principles of data stewardship align closely with the well-established FAIR principles:\nFindable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. In addition, we suggest that twenty-first\ncentury notions of data stewardship add a further principle of Al Readiness.\n\nBelow, we offer a breakdown of how data stewardship complements these principles:\n\n1. Findable:\n\u039f Ensure that data is well-documented and indexed so that users can locate it easily.\n\u039f Develop and maintain metadata standards to describe data comprehensively.\n\u039f Assign unique and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to datasets.\n2. Accessible:\n\u039f Facilitate access to data while adhering to legal, ethical, and regulatory\nrequirements.\n\u039f Implement clear and secure access protocols, including user authentication and\nauthorization processes.\n\u039f Define access conditions, such as open data licenses or agreements for restricted\naccess.\n3. Interoperable:\n\u039f Promote the use of standardized formats, vocabularies, and ontologies to enable\nseamless integration and reuse of data."}, {"title": "Data Stewardship in the Era of Artificial Intelligence (AI)", "content": "As noted, the rise of Al has both changed some of the expected functions of Data Stewards and\nelevated their importance to unprecedented levels. Modern Al systems are heavily reliant on\nhigh-quality datasets to function effectively. In addition, incomplete or unrepresentative data can\nlead to biases in Al systems that may create new or exacerbate existing social and economic\ndivisions and forms of marginalization. For all these reasons, data governance provides the\nbedrock of Al governance, and (chief) data stewards play a key role in the age of Al.\nSome particular considerations would include (see also above in making data Al Ready):\n\n1. Ensuring Data Quality: Al requires accurate, comprehensive, and representative\ndatasets. Data stewards play a critical role in curating, validating, and maintaining these\ndatasets to minimize biases and errors.\n2. Responsible Data Reuse: As Al applications often involve sensitive and personal data,\ndata stewards ensure compliance with Al regulations and ethical standards, mitigating\nrisks associated with misuse or unintended consequences.\n3. Facilitating Cross-Sector Collaboration: Al development often relies on diverse data\nsources. Data stewards act as intermediaries to enable the creation of data commons or\ndata sharing across sectors while maintaining trust and safeguarding data integrity.\n4. Transparency and Accountability: Data stewards can promote transparency in how Al\nmodels use data, ensuring stakeholders understand data provenance, processing\nmethods, and potential biases.\n5. Supporting Al Innovation: By establishing robust data governance frameworks, data\nstewards can create environments where Al innovations can thrive, balancing innovation\nwith responsibility. They reduce the risk of missed-use, even while protecting against\nmisuse."}, {"title": "Looking Forward: Challenges and Opportunities", "content": "Data stewardship is a multifaceted concept encompassing competencies, roles, intermediary\nfunctions, and principles. Its diverse manifestations and dimensions highlight the complexity of\nmanaging data responsibly and effectively, especially in the age of Al. By understanding these\ndimensions and their interconnections, organizations can overcome confusion and implement\nstewardship practices that maximize data's value while safeguarding ethical standards.\n\nAs with so much of the digital world, the landscape for data stewardship going forward is\ncharacterized by both risk and opportunity. Often, these are two sides of the same coin:\nwell-managed challenges can unleash new potential. In closing, we highlight three risks, and then\nfollow with three pathways to transform those risks into opportunity.\n\nThree Risks:\n\n1. Ambiguity: The broad and multi-faceted nature of data stewardship may create\nconfusion, making it difficult for organizations to implement effective practices and\nleading to under-utilized or irresponsibly managed data assets.\n2. Resistance to Change: Adopting stewardship practices and principles, especially those\nthat require making data accessible in a more systematic manner, may encounter\ninstitutional inertia or skepticism.\n3. Resource Constraints: Effective stewardship requires investment in skills, technologies,\nand infrastructure. The case for these investments may be hard to make, especially given\nthe ambiguity.\n\nFrom Risk to Opportunity:\n\n1. Standardize Definitions: Clarify the scope of data stewardship to align expectations and\npractices. This can lead to a more widespread adoption and implementation of data\nstewardship practices, helping unleash the potential of under-utilized data assets.\n2. Promote Capacity Building: Train individuals in the competencies required for\nstewardship roles. This can lead to more systematic, sustainable and responsible data\nre-use.\n3. Foster Collaboration and Change Management: Leverage the intermediary function of\ndata stewardship to build trust, establish digital self-determination, and drive innovation.\nCollaboration is one of the most important change management objectives needed\ntoward driving innovation and inclusion in the twenty-first century.\n\nThe Need for a Professional Association\n\nMany of these risks could be managed\u2014and potential unleashed\u2014with more formal structures\ndedicated to data stewardship. In conclusion, we therefore suggest establishing a professional\nsociety or association dedicated to data stewardship. This group, which would be multi-sectoral\nand international in nature, would help standardize practices, advocate for resources, and\nsupport professional development of data stewards. Such an association could also play a crucial\nrole in addressing the challenges and fostering a global community of practitioners committed to\nadvancing responsible data governance. In so doing, it would help fulfill the tremendous potential\nof this critical twenty-first century asset in a manner that was responsible, inclusive, and\ninnovation-enhancing."}]}

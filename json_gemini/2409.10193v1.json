A swarm of autonomous drones/UAVs programmed to work in real-time observing the fire parameters using their onboard sensors would be valuable in reducing the life-threatening impact of that fire. However autonomous UAVs face serious challenges in their positioning and navigation in critical bushfire conditions such as remoteness and severe weather conditions where GPS signals could also be unreliable. This paper tackles one of the most important factors in autonomous UAV navigation, namely Initial Positioning sometimes called Localisation. The solution provided by this paper will enable a team of autonomous UAVs to establish a relative position to their base of operation to be able to commence a team search and reconnaissance in a bushfire-affected area and find their way back to their base without the help of GPS signals..", "sections": [{"title": "6-Introduction", "content": "The use of radio frequency (RF) signals for positioning and navigation has advanced significantly in recent years, particularly in scenarios where Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are unavailable or unreliable.

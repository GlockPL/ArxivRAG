INTRODUCTION", "content": "Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a new generation of wireless technology that enables vehicles to interact with the surrounding infrastructure and other mobile units on the road. The vehicles can communicate under the V2X umbrella in four modes: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) [1]. These modes of communication offer cooperative awareness to provide intelligent transportation services. There are two major V2X standards: Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and cellular-based V2X (C-V2X). DSRC is standardized by the IEEE, whereas C-V2X is defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in the context of 4G and 5G networks [2].\nThe Internet of Vehicles (IoV) emerged for linking vehicles together through networks of interconnected units that communicate with one another and with the surrounding infrastructure. The IoV has the potential to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, reduce road accidents, and improve overall transportation safety and efficiency through connectivity enabling real-time situational awareness. This can be done by exchanging safety-related information through the basic safety message (BSM). The BSM is broadcast by a DSRC or C-V2X device to inform other nearby vehicles about vehicle position, speed, and so forth, as well as any circumstance that has been detected on the road. These messages are short, single-message transmissions that are sent regularly by all vehicles [3].\nMechanisms to detect, avoid, and manage packets congestion to alleviate vehicle congestion is of critical importance as mostly the road traffic congestion is leading to packet congestion via the increased communication demand within close proximity of vehicles. V2X congestion management mechanisms can be categorized into five classes: rate-based, power-based, carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)/collision avoidance (CA)-based, priority and scheduling-based, and hybrid [4]. Several work items have discussed this problem in the literature [5]\u2013[9]. In [5], the authors aim to anticipate road hazards for V2X via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to enhance road safety. The authors of [6] proposed stacked LSTM for improving the traffic conditions of vehicular networks. The work presented in [7] introduces an accumulative approach to time series prediction based on LSTM, aiming to improve the accuracy of predictions. The study in [8] integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM models to classify various Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithms, enhancing the understanding and management of V2X congestion control. In [9], the authors studied a hybrid congestion control for allocating traffic by employing a fusion model for traffic prediction.\nWhile these work items have explored the use of LSTM for congestion control for vehicular networks, the integration of LSTM for congestion protection with the packet prioritization for proactive congestion management to improve delay and minimize dropped safety packets has not been well addressed. Therefore, this work introduces a proactive open-loop prioritized scheduling scheme that predicts IoV channel congestion to avoid such conditions. Using a LSTM for real-time forecasting and a historical congestion database with selective features, the proposed method ensures accurate prediction results. It classifies packets into two categories, ensuring high-priority safety messages are transmitted without delay even in congested scenarios. The key contributions of this paper are detailed further\n\u2022 We design and implement a real-time framework for proactive network congestion management for IoV. Congestion events are predicted before they occur to facilitate packet scheduling actions that enhance the delivery ratio of the most important packets.\n\u2022 Through the course of this study, an enormous dataset is generated using Network Simulator Version 3 (NS3), which contains the congestion channel parameters to be"}, {"title": "II. PROPOSED SOLUTION", "content": "The increasing population and expanding metropolitan areas has led to increased road congestion. Vehicular traffic congestion can lead to network congestion which severely impacts the network performance. Furthermore, the degradation of link reliability and packet delivery ratio due to a congested channel can have dire road safety consequences. As a result, it is critical to be able to handle congested situations in vehicular networks and provide the highest safety levels for vehicles and pedestrians. The problem focuses on developing an effective framework for channel congestion prediction enabling real-time adjustments that are protocol agnostic and scalable.\nWe introduce a framework to address real-time congestion prediction and packet classification in IoV networks. We utilize LSTM, known for its capability to capture temporal dependencies in traffic data, to predict network congestion. We implement stacked LSTM allowing the model to learn hierarchical traffic patterns through multiple LSTM layers to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, we introduce K-means clustering for packet classification based on key features extracted from simulation data, enabling dynamic prioritization and timely delivery of safety-critical messages.\nThe congestion management framework consists of three phases. First, the IoV-based vehicular communication network scenario is practically implemented and the congestion parameters are captured under different conditions to create data set. The generated data set is used as inputs to a neural network that predicts future crowded events in real time. Finally, the system assigns distinguished priorities depending on the content of the messages, which will assist the packet clustering during network congestion."}, {"title": "A. Congestion data set generation", "content": "The aim of this stage is to detect and store the congestion parameters of vehicles in the IoV-based vehicular network in a dataset. The generated dataset contains the number of dropped packets and the time of occurrence of these packet drops. We are utilizing the NS3 as it incorporates realistic traffic models and mobility patterns that closely mimic real-world conditions. NS3 is widely recognized for testing V2X protocols because of its accuracy in emulating vehicular networks [10], [11]. The process is composed of three sub-processes: We first create an IoV-based vehicular communication scenario where the vehicles start transmitting packets under neutral congestion conditions. The IoV-based communication environment will be implemented through via multi-objective functions, such as initialization of grid parameters, creation of vehicles, and implementation of agents and traffic via a traffic simulatoras Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) tool.\nThe NS3 software applies a variable congestion rate which affects the transmission delay and packet delivery ratio of the system. The variable congestion rate is employed in our model by using a Markov chain, which can be referred to as the multi-state Markov chain error model. It is implemented to show the transition probabilities of congestion rates in matrix format where the rows reflect the current state and columns the next state of congestion, where these transitions are probabilistically determined, affecting transmission delay and packet delivery ratio. Finally, for documentation purposes, the dataset measurements captured over the simulation time that is divided into a number of time slots within each time slot there will be a different congestion rate, also packet delivery ratio will be monitored and the number of drop packets will be counted, which makes the dataset more representative of real-world situations. NS3 includes some functions to terminate and avoid congestion in the network, such as adaptive congestion window size and back-off timer which controls the retransmission timer period.\nThis paper's focus is on designing multiple functions for monitoring several factors, which give the direct indication on the number of dropped packets during the simulation time. The main modified function to generate the dataset is the Congestion Action Difference (CongActDiff) counter. CongActDiff counts how many congestion flags were activated during a predefined interval within the overall simulation scenario. The congestion flag is enabled or activated when NS3 starts the process of changing the congestion window phase from a slow start to a fast retransmission phase. Moreover, modification of the congestion window phase occurs when the size of the congestion window becomes higher than a threshold"}, {"title": "B. Real-Time Congestion Prediction", "content": "The prediction phase reiles on two elements to enable proactive actions in real-time: Firstly, the previous crowdedness log from networked vehicles, which contains the CongActDiff counter and the occurrence time during the day, is obtained. Secondly, the historical congestion dataset is fitted to the LSTM [12]. In this paper, the aim is to reach the optimum structure of the LSTM network to achieve accurate real-time prediction readings from many perspectives. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data generated by vehicular networks, as they can capture long-term dependencies and complex temporal patterns. The LSTMs, with forget, input, and output gates, address the vanishing and exploding gradient problems, ensuring stable training. Additionally, stacked LSTM layers enhance the model's capacity to learn hierarchical features, leading to improved real-time prediction accuracy. This capability is essential for proactive congestion management in IoV environments. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTMs in similar applications [5]\u2013[9]\nLSTM models can be classified as a function of the batch size, the number of epochs, and the hidden layers. An LSTM with multiple hidden layers is referred to as a stacked LSTM. The stacked LSTM model can be seen as a representational optimization, where the added layers are used to defragment the learned features of prior layers and generate high-level representations. The second concern of the LSTM model structure is the size of the batch, which controls the update of the model weights. Because real-time congestion forecasting needs an enormous historical log of previous crowded events, which cannot be processed by the LSTM model at once, the dataset is divided into small groups called batches. The batch size controls the tradeoff between the training speed and the learning process. The third feature of the LSTM model is the effect of the number of epochs on the real-time prediction process. In particular, when the model is exposed to the same random samples of the dataset many times, the model may memorize it. As a result, the LSTM network becomes over-fitted. Too few numbers of epochs, on the other hand, may lead to under-fitting. The appropriate choices for the epoch and batch sizes is presented in the next section. This solution for the congestion prediction problem is classified as an LSTM sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) prediction, where the input and output are time series sequences.\nWe denote $C_t$ and $h_t$ as the cell state and final hidden state at time t, respectively. We consider $x_t$ at the vector of the input sequence at time step t. Eq. 1 to Eq. 6 shows how the single LSTM works, while Eq. 7 generalizes this to the stacked LSTM [6]. First, the computation of the forget and input gate vectors are given as follows:\n$f_t = \\sigma (W_{f}.x_{t} + W_{h}.h_{t-1}+b_{f}),$ (1)\n$i_t = \\sigma (W_{i}.x_{t} + W_{h}.h_{t-1}+b_{i}),$ (2)\nThen, we compute a vector of new candidate values that can be added to the cell state:\n$\\bar{C_t} = tanh(W_{c}.x_{t} + W_{h}.h_{t-1}+b_{c}),$ (3)\nThe next step is to update the new cell status $C_t$ with the new information and the calculated gate vectors:\n$C_t = i_t * \\bar{C_t} + f_t * C_{t-1},$ (4)\nThen, the output gate determines the required portion of the cell state will be at the output:\n$O_t = \\sigma (W_{o}.x_{t} + W_{h}.h_{t-1}+b_{o}),$ (5)\nFinally, we compute the hidden state at the output using the output gate vector and the cell state:\n$h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)$ (6)\nThe connection between the input $x_t$ and three LSTM gates and cell input is controlled by weight matrices $W_i$, $W_f$, $W_o$, and $W_C$, while $W_h$, $W_h$, $W_h$, and $W_c$ are weight matrices adjusting the link between previous hidden layer state $h_{t-1}$ and three gates plus cell input. The $b_i$, $b_f$, $b_o$, and $b_c$ are bias factors of input, forget, output, and cell input respectively, a sigmoid activation function used in LSTM calculation and $tanh$ expresses the hyperbolic tangent function which used to overcome the vanishing gradient problem. In a stacked LSTM, these operations are repeated for each $l$ layer:\n$h_l, C_l = LSTM(x_t, h_{l-1}, C_{l-1})$ (7)"}, {"title": "C. Packet Prioritization and Classification", "content": "Congestion scenarios and channels can effectively decrease the reliability of the system. The previous crowdedness disadvantage has a damageable weight on the packet delivery ratio. The third procedure proposed in our system is crystallizing the importance of delivering safety message in congestion conditions. The predicted congestion facilitates system flexibility by giving higher priority to safety critical messages for improving their delivery ratio in congested conditions.\nPrioritization of packets is based on the content of the message by adding a priority field to the TCP header within the creation of packets in the Medium Access Control (MAC)"}, {"title": "III.

The simulation scenario employs the two-ray ground radio propagation model with omnidirectional antennas and the 802.11p MAC protocol for IoV communications. The packets are routed between vehicles using the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. The number of vehicles simulated in this scenario is 150 driving at a fixed speed of 25 kilometers per hour. The simulation time is 450 hours.

LSTM Network Structure and Results", "content": "The LSTM is fed with the generated dataset from the previous steps. The data set is partitioned as 70% and 30% for training and testing. We consider different LSTM structures based on the size of the batch, number of epochs and the number of hidden layers. The results show that the performance of the LSTM model greatly improves by decreasing the size of the batch from 128 to 32. The small batch size is capable of effectively capturing the generalization pattern of the dataset. The second parameter used to investigate the LSTM model structure is the number of epochs, where more epochs enhance the accuracy of predictions The depth of the the LSTM model refers to the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer.\nLSTM significantly outperforms the single LSTM. Specifically, the two-layer stacked LSTM achieves an RMSE that is less than 50% of the RMSE of the single LSTM, with a prediction accuracy of 98.53%. This high level of accuracy, combined with efficient training, highlights the stacked LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies, making it ideal for real-time congestion prediction in IoV networks.\nFig. 5 illustrates the Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) comparison between the proposed LSTM-based method and a standard Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) over the training episodes. The RMSPE, a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models, is defined as:\n$RMSPE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\frac{Y_i-\\hat{Y_i}}{Y_i})^2} \\times 100$, where $y_i$ is the actual value, $\\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value, and n is the number of observations. The proposed LSTM method demonstrates superior performance, rapidly converging to a lower RMSPE within the initial episodes and maintaining a stable error rate of approximately 3-5%. In contrast, the RNN shows significant fluctuations with a higher RMSPE, stabilizing around 8-12%. This outcome highlights the LSTM's ability to effectively capture long-term dependencies and overcome the vanishing gradient problem that degrades the RNN performance, resulting in more accurate and stable predictions."}, {"title": "C. Packet Prioritization and Classification Model", "content": "The K-means classification model is fed by a packet header dataset during the simulation time, which contains 1,048,576 entries. This dataset contains all previously mentioned packet header fields despite that the effective fields which are used to categorize the packet are the TTL and the priority. Therefore, based on the provided classification features the aim of this step is to classify all created packets into two classes, the most critical and the least critical packets. The most critical packets have a small TTL and high priority and will be sent first and immediately. The least critical packets deal with the channel's normal conditions, which are sent in case of free congestion or dropped channel. For the K-means++ implementation the candidate center must minimize the sum squared distances from each case point being clustered to the first randomly chosen cluster center."}, {"title": "IV.

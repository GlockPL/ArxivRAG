To ensure their responsible deployment in critical applications, it is crucial to understand the safety capabilities and vulnerabilities of LLMs. Previous works mainly focus on jailbreak in single-round dialogue, overlooking the potential jailbreak risks in multi-round dialogues, which are a vital way humans interact with and extract information from LLMs. Some studies have increasingly concentrated on the risks associated with jailbreak in multi-round dialogues. These efforts typically involve the use of manually crafted templates or prompt engineering techniques. However, due to the inherent complexity of multi-round dialogues, their jailbreak performance is limited. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, emphasizing the importance of stealthiness in identifying and mitigating potential threats to human values posed by LLMs. We propose a risk decomposition strategy that distributes risks across multiple rounds of queries and utilizes psychological strategies to enhance attack strength.

LLMs possess an extensive reservoir of knowledge, including harmful or sensitive content. Attackers intend to elicit harmful content from the models that align with their harmful intent. Therefore, evaluating the safety and reliability of LLMs is essential due to their profound impact on society. Red-teaming plays a critical role in assessing the safety and reliability of LLMs, aiming to identify various flaws in the models and mitigate potential harm in the future.\nMost red teaming efforts focus on designing single-round attack prompts. For example, some attack methods (Zou et al. 2023a; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2024) hide malicious queries in forms that are not immediately recognizable, such as encoding harmful queries into ciphertext (Yuan et al. 2023) or ASCII codes (Jiang et al. 2024) to prompt the model to generate harmful responses. Subsequent works (Zhu et al. 2023; Yu, Lin, and Xing 2023; Kang et al. 2023; Yuan et al. 2023; Chao et al. 2023a) optimize their attack prompts in either a black-box or white-box manner to elicit model responses to harmful prompts. However, as emphasized in (Ma et al. 2024; Perez et al. 2022), existing methods overlook a crucial aspect: in real-world scenarios, human-LLM interactions are inherently multi-round. Consequently, relying solely on single-round attacks to model these interactions lacks practical significance and fails to capture the complex dynamics between users and LLMs.\nRecent advancements in multi-round dialogue strategies have demonstrated promising results in red-teaming attacks, effectively exploiting the sequential nature of interactions to conceal harmful intents. For instance, the approach proposed in (Zhou et al. 2024) aggregates responses from each round and then reverses the process to yield harmful content. Alternatively, other methods (Russinovich, Salem, and Eldan 2024; Yang et al. 2024) employ iterative trial-and-error tactics to induce language models to generate unsafe outputs. However, a key limitation of existing multi-round dialogue attack methods is their reliance on powerful language models like GPT to launch the attack, which may trigger the models' safety mechanisms and result in rejected requests, thereby reducing the attack's efficiency. Furthermore, while existing methods have demonstrated multi-round attack formats, they lack a core quantifiable and reusable mechanism, which is crucial for advancing the field's tactical sophistication for various real-world applications.\nTherefore, in this work, we propose a novel multi-round dialogue attack mechanism. We conceptualize the process of multi-round dialogue attack as a heuristic search process, where, given a malicious query (e.g., how to make a bomb), we identify harmful responses related to the instruction as the targets of the search. The search initiates with a related but innocuous question (e.g., chemical reaction), and, based on the language model's response, can either explore similar related queries (e.g., chemical experiment) or delve deeper into more sensitive topics (e.g., explosive reaction), ultimately leading to a harmful response. To achieve this, we devise two strategies:\n\u2022 Information-based control strategy, which governs the trial-and-error process by controlling the information similarity between generated inquiries and the original inquiry,\n\u2022 Psychology induction strategy, which incorporates psychological tactics (Zeng et al. 2024a) to minimize the likelihood of rejection as we approach our target.\nAn illustration of our attack mechanism is depicted in Figure 6. We have trained a red-teaming agent (short for MRJ-Agent) to automate the execution of this process, demonstrating a high effectiveness on attack.\nWe further evaluated the attack success rate of our proposed method. The experimental results showed that our approach outperformed existing attack methods, including single-round and multi-round attacks, on both closed-source and open-source models, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates. Moreover, we tested the versatility of our method on tasks beyond text-to-text, including image-to-text and text-to-text tasks, using closed-source models GPT-40 and DALLE-3 respectively. The experiments demonstrated the generality of our multi-round attack mechanism across various tasks. In summary, owing to its high adaptability and exploratory nature, our proposed method is capable of developing more general attack strategies that can be applied to different models and scenarios. We demonstrate that our method can effectively explore potential vulnerabilities or boundary conditions of the model being tested. We hope that our work will promote further research on the security of large models in the future."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "We categorize current attacks into two main categories: single-round attacks and multi-round attacks. In single-round attacks, Human Jailbreaks (Shen et al. 2023) utilize a fixed set of in-the-wild templates, incorporating behavioral strings as attack requests. Gradient-Based Attacks involve constructing jailbreak prompts based on the gradients of the target model, as seen in methods like GCG (Zou et al. 2023a), AutoDAN (Zhu et al. 2023) and I-GCG (Jia et al. 2024). Logits-Based Attacks focus on forming jailbreak prompts according to the logits of output tokens, exemplified by COLD (Guo et al. 2024). Additionally, there are attacks based on fine-tuning, which also necessitate access to internal information of the model. While many of these techniques demonstrate some effectiveness on closed-source models, their results are often suboptimal. Some attacks primarily utilize prompt engineering either to directly fool LMs or to evolve attack prompts iteratively. For instance, LLM-Based generation approaches, such as PAIR (Chao et al. 2023a), GPTFUZZER (Yu, Lin, and Xing 2023), and PAP (Zeng et al. 2024b), involve an attacker LLM that iteratively updates the jailbreak prompt by querying the target model and refining the prompt based on the responses obtained.\nRegarding multi-round attacks, Multi-round dialogue attacks remain relatively uncommon in the context of red-teaming. Recent studies have introduced several multi-round dialogue attack methods. For example, (Zhou et al. 2024) decomposes an original query into several questions, integrating the target model's answers and reversing them to obtain harmful information. Although this approach leverages the multi-round dialogue structure, it does not mimic natural human conversation. In contrast, some works (Russinovich, Salem, and Eldan 2024; Yang et al. 2024) adopt more human-like dialogue paradigms by utilizing predefined templates, initiating the interaction with initial questions, and progressively generating subsequent inquiries based on the model's responses. Notably, Chain-of-Attack (CoA) (Yang et al. 2024) posits that the semantic similarity between the model's responses and the original query increases with each round, consequently enhancing the overall effectiveness of the attack. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that these methods rely heavily on the existing conversational capabilities of LLMs (e.g. GPT-4) to perform attacks, thus limiting practicality."}, {"title": "2.2 Defenses", "content": "Currently, enhancing the safety of LLMs can be approached from three aspects. External detector: This approach relies on identifying unusually high perplexity. As proposed by (Jain et al. 2023; Alon and Kamfonas 2023), techniques such as rephrasing and retokenizing can reduce harm while preserving the meaning of benign inputs. Additionally, methods like those suggested by (Inan et al. 2023) directly detect harmful queries by randomly dropping tokens or utilizing in-context introspection. In-context learning: Improving the system prompt is a commonly employed strategy to enhance the security and reliability of LLMs (Zeng et al. 2024a). However, some closed-source models do not allow direct access to the system prompt. In addition, alignment training, which evolved from Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) (Wu et al. 2021) to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Dong et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024), is regarded as the most effective way but also requires the most resources. With high-quality value-aligned training data, LLMs align with human values and develop defense mechanisms against harmful queries. It is important to note that the intrinsic safety of LLMs is an ongoing and dynamic process where alignment improves as data becomes richer and more refined. The proposed attack methods will prompt the safety of LLM in the future."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "In this section, we first present how we quantitatively and systematically decompose specific risky queries into multi-round stealthy query forms. We then illustrate how we integrate this attack process into the red team model, enabling the automated execution of attacks. An overview of our proposed method is illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"title": "3.1 Decomposition of Harmful Query", "content": "We propose a heuristic framework that gradually decomposes risky intentions across multiple rounds of inquiry. As we mentioned in the introduction, we consider the multi-round attack as a heuristic search. An effective search strategy should revolve around the ultimate search goal (namely the harmful query), and to achieve this, we use an information-based approach to control the overall query quality in the multi-round attack. To be specific, given a harmful query x, we intend to decompose x into multiple sub-queries through multi-round, distributing the evident risk intent to different sub-queries. We denote the process of transformation as $T_a$. We utilize LLMs (GPT-4, etc) to generate a series of subqueries based on predefined templates (please refer to the Appendix). During the process of decomposing queries, we check whether the currently generated queries still maintain a similar intent to the original query x. Here, we refer to the method in (Reimers and Gurevych 2019) to measure the semantic similarity between two sentences:\n$I(x, x') = \\frac{\\varphi(x) \\cdot \\varphi(x')}{||\\varphi(x)||||\\varphi(x') ||}$\nwhere $\\varphi(.)$ represents the sentence embedding model (Reimers and Gurevych 2019). In order to ensure that the decomposed sub-queries $X_{td} = {X_1,X_2,X_3, ...}$ still maintain a certain level of semantic similarity with the original query x, we generate a new query $x_r$ summarizing the sub-queries. If $I (x_r, x) < \\tau$ the generated queries are discarded. Some cases are shown in Table 1. A successful multi-round attack query should ensure that each round of inquiry does not repeat the original query but still implicitly focuses on the malicious topic, inducing the target harmful content. Our experiments show that by restricting the similarity, we significantly improve the success rate of the attack."}, {"title": "3.2 Refine Harmful Queries with Psychological Strategies", "content": "In order to better elicit harmful responses during interaction with the target model, we incorporate psychological strategies to enhance this series of sub-queries. We further applied various psychological strategies (denoted as $T_p$) to the generated sub-queries. We referred to the work of (Zeng et al. 2024a) by employing psychological strategies and, following the results presented in the paper, eliminated ineffective psychological strategies, ultimately selecting a total of 13 strategies. We implement $T_p$ with the template (details on psychological strategies and template are provided in the Appendix). In this way, we completed the transformation for the given initial harmful query x, we denoted the result queries generated by $T_p$ as $X_p$. However, the effectiveness of applying different psychological strategies varies for different queries. To address this, we further trained a red team agent, which is more capable of learning the two aforementioned transformations effectively.\nOverall, we liken the process of obtaining responses to harmful issues to searching within the knowledge reservoirs of a model. Risk problem decomposition transforms a problem into multiple trial-and-error attempts to gradually approach the eventual response to the harmful query x. However, there are still risks in this process of decomposition, and psychological strategies are further applied to make the model more likely to output responses for better interaction. Namely, our red-teaming agent can design different psychological strategies for asking questions based on different risk query and dynamically adjust the next round of query based on the responses from the target models."}, {"title": "3.3 Training Red-team Model", "content": "We aim to develop a red-team model $\\pi_{red}$ that can automatically carry out the aforementioned multi-round attacks based on the responses of tested models in an interactive way. We collected data based on successful attacks from $X_t$, $X_p$, and multi-round responses from different models. We curated the successful attack data as $D = {(x, Y_w)}$. Then, we initialized a red-team model $\\pi$ through supervised fine-tuning. This process removes the distribution shift between the aligned model and the true distribution. In other words, after this process, the model can carry out basic multi-round dialogue attacks:\n$\\pi_{ref} = arg max_{\\pi} E_{x,yw\\sim D}[log \\pi(Y_w|x)]$\nFurthermore, to enable the model to dynamically generate the most effective query based on the currently given x, following the definition of the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry 1952), we constructed a set of partial order pairs based on the varying psychology strategies on the same x and the different attack outcomes from the evaluation. Considering the intricate process of constructing a reward model, we apply the Direct Preference Optimization (Rafailov et al. 2024) strategy to train our red-team model $\\pi_{red}$:\n$-E_{(x,yw,y_l)\\sim D}[log\\sigma (\\beta \\frac{\\pi_{red}(Y_w|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(Y_w|x)} - \\beta log \\frac{\\pi_{red}(y_l|x)}{\\pi_{ref}(y_l|x)})]$\nAfter obtaining the red-team model $\\pi_{red}$, it executes the Algorithm 1. We set $N_t = 1$ and $N = 10$ during evaluation."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "Threat models, baselines and defenses. We consider both open- and closed-source models. For closed-source models, we use GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 (Achiam et al. 2023). Regarding open-source models, we use VICUNA-7B-1.5 (Chiang et al. 2023), LLAMA2-7B-CHAT (Touvron et al. 2023), and MISTRAL-7B-INSTRUCT-0.2 (Jiang et al. 2023) as the target models for comparison experiments. The details of target models are presented in the Appendix. The proposed method is compared to single-round and multi-round attacks. Single-round attack include the following baselines: GCG (Zou et al. 2023b), MAC (Zhang and Wei 2024), AutoDAN (Liu et al. 2023), Probe-Sampling (Zhao et al. 2024), Advprompter (Paulus et al. 2024), PAIR (Chao et al. 2023b), PAP (Zeng et al. 2024a) and TAP (Mehrotra et al. 2023). We use the settings as reported in the original works. Multi-round attacks include CoT (Yang et al. 2024) and Speak out of round Attack (STA) (Zhou et al. 2024). Regarding defenses, we consider two typical defense strategies: prompt detector (Inan et al. 2023) and system prompt safeguard.\nDatasets. We adopt several datasets for different experiments."}, {"title": "4.2 Evaluation on Attack Strength", "content": "Comparision with Single-round attacks. We evaluated the ASR (attack success rate) of different attack methods, including our proposed method, across multiple attack models: Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, LLama2-7B, and GPT-4. The results are presented in Table 2. Among the various models, Mistral-7B and Vicuna-7B exhibited considerable vulnerability across various attack strategies, with our method achieving the highest ASR at 100%. Traditional methods like AdvPrompter(Paulus et al. 2024) had lower efficacy, while GCG showed significant effectiveness with 98% and 92% ASR Our method demonstrated a ASR of 92% on the LLama2-7B model, while achieving an 100% ASR on the Vicuna-7B model. While LLama2-7B illustrates robust resistance against other attack methodologies, with ASR generally not surpassing 68%. Our method achieves a success rate of 92% on LLama2-7B, significantly surpassing that of other approaches. This result demonstrates that our method retains a high ASR even when targeting LLMs with strong safety abilities. Furthermore, our attacking methodology also displays promising results on closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Notably, compared to other attack methods, our approach does not experience a decline in performance on these closed-source models, maintaining an impressive ASR close to 100%. This emphasizes the practicality and effectiveness of our method.\nComparision with Multi-round attacks. We also compared the ASR of other multi-round dialogue methods, conducting tests on both LLama2-7B and GPT-4. We set a simple baseline multi-round attack which uses prompts for red-team model role-playing. For this comparison, both Speak out of round(Zhou et al. 2024) and CoA (Yang et al. 2024) utilized GPT-4 as the attack model. We controlled the number of dialogue rounds between 3 and 5 as settings in their work. Given that CoA employs a retry strategy, we constrained its maximum retries to 10 to maintain a fair comparison. The final results are presented in Table 3. As illustrated, the pure use of GPT-4 to play the role of a red team model has completely failed (baseline result), due to OpenAI's policy of not allowing direct execution (especially as an attacker) of tasks with content risk. This further illustrates that executing multi-turn conversations requires a dedicated red-teaming model. Our results demonstrate a significantly higher ASR than other multi-round dialogue attack methods. Furthermore, due to CoA's reliance on multiple retries, our approach not only achieves superior ASR but also exhibits considerably faster performance than CoA, highlighting its practical advantages in real-world applications."}, {"title": "Attack strength under defense", "content": "We then assessed the success rate of our method under basic defense methods. We tested a detection-based defense method, LLamaGuard-7B (Inan et al. 2023), which checks if the query is harmful before deciding whether to enter the model, and if detected as harmful, it fails. Additionally, we tested incorporating defensive system prompts to enhance the model's defense: \"You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content...\". We designed two sets of experiments with Max trial = 1 and Max trial = 2, and summarized the results in the Table 4. As shown in the table, the success rate of our attack method decreased under different defense methods, and we found that increasing the trial count to 2 effectively improved the success rate. Among the two tested defense methods, the system prompt guard better enhanced the model's defense capability. We examined the evaluation data and found that adding protective system prompts led to a higher probability of the model rejecting potentially risky queries, resulting in a decrease in our success rate. However, overall, our proposed method still maintains a relatively high success rate. This indicates that our attack method is stealthy and has a strong ability to bypass attack detection and self-protection."}, {"title": "4.3 Evaluation on Generalization", "content": "Beyond harmful behaviors on AdvBench In addition to AdvBench, we evaluate the attack capability of our red-team model on JBB data benchmark for testing generalization. We set the maximum number of trials to 2 times, with a maximum of 10 rounds of questioning in each trial. Through evaluation on JBB, our method achieved a success rate of 93.9%, confirming the general attack capability of our method, with an average query count of 8.04. This is compared to the need for more queries in AdvBench to induce the model to generate harmful content. The most difficult attack categories were Sexual Content, with a success rate of only 71.42% and an average query count of 11.85, significantly higher than the need for queries in other risk categories."}, {"title": "Beyond text-to-text task", "content": "In addition, we further verify whether our model can be used for tasks other than text-to-text. We tested our red-teaming model on two additional common tasks: Task I: Text & Image to Text. We manually constructed 10 queries and paired them with harmless relevant images. We tested whether our model could output harmful content for harmless images, with the tested model being GPT-40. Task II: Text to Image. Similarly, we manually constructed 10 harmful drawing instructions. We tested whether our adversarial model could prompt the tested model to output harmful images corresponding to the harmful drawing instructions. We test the attack success rate on GPT-40 and DALLE-3 respectively."}, {"title": "4.4 Ablation Study", "content": "Effectiveness of information semantic $I(x, x')$ Ideally, the generated sub-queries are expected to logically represent the original harmful queries but found models were sometimes inconsistent. Using \"Offer a guide on how to cheat in online exams\" as an example of different decompositions, there are two common failure scenarios (as shown in Table 1): 1) the generated sub-query simply repeats the initial question. 2) The generated sub-query gradually becomes a benign query, losing the initial query's malicious intent. To filter out these two types of failures, we set the similarity threshold for the first sub-query after decomposition to be less than 0.25. To keep the final set of sub-queries relevant to attack intention, we set a minimum similarity of 0.85 with the original. The end result was a 0.87 similarity score and an average of 6.37 sub-queries in the final output."}, {"title": "Effectiveness of psychological strategies", "content": "Psychological strategies are used to make the generated sub-queries more conducive for the targeted model. We evaluate the attack success rate on LLama2-7B-chat and GPT-4 based on the decomposed sub-queries and the sub-queries enhanced with different psychological strategies. It is noted that for both models, the ASR of initial queries is 0%. Decomposed sub-queries achieve a success rate of 16% and 25% on LLama2-7B and GPT-4 respectively. Regarding enhanced sub-queries, there is a 32.8% attack success rate on LLama2-7B and a 39.7% attack success rate on GPT-4. Among all 13 types of psychological strategies, \"Multi-faceted evidence support\" proves to be the most effective, consistent with previous findings that LLMs demonstrate flattery phenomena (Sharma et al. 2023) and are more likely influenced by \"expert and authoritative\" strategies. It is noteworthy that not all psychological strategies contribute to an increase in the success rate of attacks. For example, the overall success rate of \"reflective thinking\" is slightly lower than that of decomposed queries.\nThis experimental result indicates that although static multi-turn attacks have a certain success rate, they are still far inferior to our red team model's dynamic execution of multi-turn dialogue attacks in interacting with the target model. This highlights the importance of continuously generating new queries in dynamic interactions. We believe is due to the red team model's own knowledge and its ability to truly grasp how to induce the target model to output harmful responses. Meanwhile, it can dynamically adjust new queries based on the target model's feedback, resulting in a high attack success rate."}, {"title": "Ablation study on model size, max trials, max rounds", "content": "We also evaluated the impact of different red-team model sizes on the success rate of attacks. We tested the 7B model and the 14B red-team model when attacking the LLama2-7B model, with varying numbers of attempts and different maximum conversation rounds. We summarized the test results in Table 5.\nAs shown in the table, the success rate of the 14B model is significantly higher than the 7B model (although for efficiency considerations, we used the 7B red-team model throughout the experiment). For both the 7B and 13B red-team models, the success rate of attacking the LLama-2-7B model within 5 rounds is relatively low. When the max round is set to 10, there is a more stable success rate. When the max round is set to 15, further evaluation of the data revealed that the 13B model, due to its stronger contextual abilities, is still able to ask relatively diverse and relevant questions based on the context, while the questions asked by the 7B red-team model tend to become somewhat repetitive as the round number increases. As for setting the max trial, we found that increasing the number of attempts has a noticeable effect on increasing the success rate. However, when the rounds cannot exceed 5, both models cannot guarantee a 100% success rate."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we introduce a novel multi-round dialogue jailbreaking agent, MRJ-Agent, designed to assess and enhance the safety and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in critical applications.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The rapid advancement of diffusion models represents a pivotal shift in synthetic media generation. These models offer an unparalleled degree of control and realism, outpacing GANs in producing high-quality, diverse images [1], [2]. Platforms like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion have made this technology widely accessible, enabling users, even without technical expertise, to generate photorealistic content from simple text prompts [3]. This democratization of content creation fosters innovation in various fields. For example, in art and design, diffusion models are used to explore new aesthetic possibilities [4], while in fields such as medical imaging and scientific visualization, they assist in generating highly detailed and accurate visual data for analysis [5], [6].\nHowever, the increasing sophistication and accessibility of diffusion models also give rise to significant ethical and societal concerns. Their capacity to generate hyper-realistic images, including the ability to synthesize visuals from textual descriptions [7], opens the door to malicious uses. Deepfakes, for instance, can be weaponized to manipulate public opinion and spread misinformation at an unprecedented scale [8], [9]. Additionally, the widespread use of these models raises serious copyright and intellectual property issues, as diffusion models can inadvertently reproduce content from their training datasets, raising concerns about unauthorized replication of protected works [10]-[13]. These challenges necessitate the development of robust detection mechanisms to safeguard against the misuse of this powerful technology.\nThe exceptional realism of images generated by diffusion models threatens the credibility of digital visual media. As these synthetic images become nearly indistinguishable from genuine photographs [14], the risk of malicious use, including the spread of fake news, creation of fraudulent content, and impersonation, grows exponentially [15], [16]. Current detection techniques, primarily designed for GAN-generated content, often fail to accurately identify the subtle artifacts and nuanced manipulations characteristic of diffusion-based generation [17], [18].\nFurthermore, the rapid evolution of diffusion models, with frequent changes in architectures, training data, and post-processing techniques, demands detection systems that can adapt to new, unseen models. These systems must not only be accurate but also robust to variations in model design and capable of generalizing across different diffusion models [2], [19]. The growing prevalence of mixed-content imagery, such as inpainted or subtly altered photos, adds another layer of difficulty to the detection process, as synthetic elements become even harder to distinguish from real ones [20]. Additionally, diffusion-based text-to-image generation introduces further challenges, complicating the detection of AI-generated text embedded within images [7].\nThis articles provides a comprehensive analysis of current research aimed at detecting content generated by diffusion models (see Fig 1 for the taxonomy). It examines the unique characteristics of diffusion-generated content, such as the subtle artifacts and intricate visual manipulations, and the specific challenges these pose for detection. Additionally, it reviews a wide range of detection methodologies proposed in"}, {"title": "II. FUNDAMENTALS OF DIFFUSION MODELS AND DETECTION CHALLENGES", "content": "Diffusion models generate content by progressively reversing a noise-adding process. Initially, a real image is corrupted step-by-step by adding Gaussian noise over multiple iterations until it becomes indistinguishable from pure noise. The model learns to reverse this process, denoising the image at each step, eventually reconstructing a clean, high-quality synthetic image from random noise [10]. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) improve the efficiency of this process by performing denoising in a compressed latent space, leveraging a pre-trained autoencoder [30]. Text-to-image diffusion models further complicate the process by incorporating text prompts, aligning generated images with input text, which adds a challenge to detection methods [7], [25]."}, {"title": "B. Unique Characteristics of Diffusion-Generated Content", "content": "Despite their photorealistic appearance, diffusion-generated images exhibit unique characteristics that can assist in their detection. One such feature is frequency domain artifacts. Analyzing diffusion-generated images in the Fourier domain often reveals distinct patterns, particularly in high-frequency components [3]. Diffusion models tend to underrepresent high frequencies, resulting in noticeable spectral irregularities due to the optimization objectives during training [16]. Wavelet-based analysis can also be employed to detect subtle frequency-domain clues [15].\nAnother important cue is the presence of spatial inconsistencies. Diffusion models often produce images with unusual noise patterns or localized statistical anomalies, which can help distinguish them from real, camera-captured images [22]. These inconsistencies are particularly evident when analyzing pixel relationships in regions with complex textures [45]. Additionally, autocorrelation analysis can reveal anomalous patterns. By measuring correlations between the original image and its shifted versions, researchers can identify deviations that are characteristic of diffusion-generated images [46].\nFurther aiding in detection is the identification of model-specific fingerprints. Each diffusion model leaves behind a unique signature in the images it generates, influenced by factors such as architecture, training data, and specific implementation choices. These fingerprints can be applied for both detection and attribution [8]. Techniques like Deep Image Fingerprint have been developed to capitalize on these traits, helping trace the lineage of generated images [26].\nOne of the most frequently observed features in diffusion-generated images is the underestimation of high frequencies, leading to less detail and sharpness compared to real images. This underrepresentation is a key target for detection methods, especially in domains like talking face generation, where the lack of high-frequency detail can be particularly noticeable [16], [47]."}, {"title": "C. Challenges in Detecting Diffusion-Generated Content", "content": "One of the central challenges in detecting diffusion-generated content is the generalization across different diffusion models. Detectors trained on a single diffusion model often fail when applied to images generated by other models, due to the presence of unique model-specific fingerprints [2]. This issue is exacerbated by the continuous release of new models, each introducing different variations in output [20].\nAnother major challenge is achieving robustness to image transformations. Real-world images undergo numerous transformations such as compression and resizing, which can degrade detection accuracy. Many current detection methods are sensitive to these transformations, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications [37]. Improving robustness to such alterations is an active area of research [8].\nAs diffusion models continue to advance, the subtle differences between real and synthetic images are becoming more difficult to detect. Sophisticated post-processing techniques, aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetic content, further blur the distinction between real and generated images [48], [49]. This requires the development of more sophisticated detection techniques.\nDetection in mixed-media content presents additional challenges, especially when synthetic and real content are combined within the same image. For instance, inpainted areas or manipulated sections may go unnoticed without specialized detection methods. Researchers are investigating weakly-supervised localization techniques to address these issues [20], [50].\nThe detection of diffusion-generated content is further complicated in real-world scenarios, such as images shared on social media. These images are often subjected to multiple layers of processing, such as compression, which further hinders detection [9]. Datasets like WildFake are being developed to simulate real-world conditions, enabling better evaluation of detection methods under practical constraints [36].\nAnother emerging challenge is detecting content replication from training data. Diffusion models may inadvertently replicate content from their training datasets, raising concerns regarding copyright infringement and data misuse [10]. Detecting these replications and mitigating such risks is becoming a critical focus of research, with strategies like caption randomization and data augmentation being explored [11].\nLastly, specialized fields, such as the detection of deep-fakes of human faces and handwriting, are also under active investigation. Diffusion-generated faces are highly realistic, and detecting these deepfakes remains a particularly difficult task. Specialized datasets, such as DiFF, support research in"}, {"title": "III. DETECTION METHODS BASED ON IMAGE ANALYSIS", "content": "Several studies have used frequency domain characteristics to distinguish diffusion-generated images from real ones. A prominent observation is the challenge diffusion models face in replicating high-frequency details accurately. [14] highlighted the systematic shortcomings of deep network-generated images in replicating high-frequency Fourier modes, which has become a foundational observation for many detection methods.\nBuilding on this, [3] introduced a method that analyzes frequency artifacts in the Fourier transform of residual images, demonstrating effectiveness even under mild JPEG compression. However, [52] noted that relying solely on high-frequency discrepancies may be fragile, as minor architectural changes to generative models can mitigate these telltale signs. Moreover, [18] explored local intrinsic dimensionality, a concept tied to frequency characteristics, employing multi Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (multiLID) for both detection and generator identification.\nResearch has also examined broader spectral power distribution discrepancies beyond high-frequency components. [46] systematically analyzed various generators, finding significant differences in mid-to-high-frequency signal content between real and synthetic images. These differences were observable through radial and angular spectral power distributions, suggesting that a more comprehensive spectral analysis can enhance detection.\nWavelet transforms, which analyze images in both frequency"}, {"title": "A. Frequency Domain Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "B. Spatial Domain Analysis", "content": "In the spatial domain, researchers have focused on analyzing local image statistics and noise patterns. [22] demonstrated that local statistical properties, which vary across regions of an image, are more effective than global statistics in distinguishing between real and diffusion-generated images. This method also showed robustness to common perturbations.\nNoise patterns, both in spatial and frequency domains, offer another line of investigation. [23] proposed a method analyzing noise patterns in the frequency domain, finding distinct differences between real and generated images. Similarly, [24] examined noise patterns in small image patches, arguing that generative models often overlook subtle noise characteristics while prioritizing realistic textures in more complex regions.\nPixel-level artifacts further contribute to detection accuracy. [4] introduced the MCAF unit, which is sensitive to pixel-level artifacts and spectral inconsistencies. This method combines text and pixel features for a more comprehensive detection strategy."}, {"title": "C. Deep Learning-Based Detection", "content": "Deep learning-based techniques have been widely employed for detecting diffusion-generated images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain popular, with [2] demonstrating that a CNN trained on a single GAN generator could generalize to other CNN-based generators. Traditional CNNs, such as those described in [25], continue to be effective for detection tasks, while [26] used CNN architectural properties for detection and model lineage analysis.\nVision Transformers (ViTs) provide an alternative to CNNs. For instance, [27] combined fine-tuned ViTs with SVMs for deepfake detection, while [28] and [29] explored the use of CLIP-ViT models, showcasing strong generalization due to their pre-trained visual-world knowledge.\nAdditionally, multi-scale networks analyze images at multiple resolutions to capture both global and local features. [15] demonstrated the effectiveness of wavelet-based multi-scale networks for robust face forgery detection. Meanwhile, dual-stream networks with cross-attention have been proposed by [53], where separate branches analyze texture and low-frequency artifacts, showing superior performance over traditional methods.\nCLIP-based detectors, which learn joint image-text representations, have also emerged as strong contenders. For instance, [19] combined CLIP features with an MLP classifier, while [4] fused CLIP-extracted text features with pixel-level artifacts. These models demonstrate robust generalization across various detection tasks."}, {"title": "D. Hybrid Approaches", "content": "Hybrid methods that combine different analysis techniques are becoming increasingly popular. For instance, [4] effectively fused frequency and spatial information by combining text features, spectral analysis, and pixel-level artifact detection. Integrating deep learning with statistical methods has also shown promise. [31] combined statistical analysis with neural networks in SeDID, while [3] integrated Fourier analysis with a deep learning classifier, marking a trend towards combining data-driven and knowledge-driven approaches for more effective detection."}, {"title": "IV. DETECTION METHODS BASED ON TEXTUAL AND MULTIMODAL ANALYSIS FOR TEXT-TO-IMAGE MODELS", "content": "With the increasing sophistication of text-to-image diffusion models, detecting AI-generated content requires a deep understanding of the relationships between input text prompts and generated images. Research in this area is growing rapidly, exploring approaches that utilize both textual and visual features to improve detection capabilities.\nOne approach focuses on analyzing the correlation between text prompts and their corresponding images. Several studies have examined how certain prompt characteristics can influence the realism of generated images. For example, [7] systematically studied the effects of prompt topics and lengths on image authenticity, finding that certain prompt types, such as those centered around \u201cperson,\u201d or prompts of specific lengths (e.g., 25-75 characters), led to more realistic images. These findings suggest that analyzing text prompts, including their topics, lengths, and even semantic nuances, can be an effective tool for distinguishing between AI-generated and authentic images. Similarly, [9] demonstrated the ability of prompts to generate highly realistic faces using Stable Diffusion v1.5, further underscoring the need to study the interplay between text and generated content.\nBuilding on the correlation between text and image features, multimodal detection techniques are gaining popularity. These methods combine both textual and visual data, leveraging the complementary information found in each modality. [4] introduced the Trinity Detector, which integrates text features from a CLIP encoder with pixel-level artifacts. Their model,"}, {"title": "V.

Existing Datasets for Evaluating Diffusion Model Detection", "content": "Several datasets have been developed to test the robustness of AI-generated image detectors. These datasets vary in their scale, diversity, and the types of challenges they present, offering a broad spectrum for evaluating detection models.\nOne such dataset is GenImage [33], a million-scale benchmark designed specifically to evaluate Al-generated image detectors. GenImage features over one million image pairs that cover a broad range of classes, including realistic degradations such as blurring and compression. This dataset is instrumental in testing detector performance across different generative models, including diffusion models and GANs. Its two primary evaluation tasks\u2014cross-generator image classification and degraded image classification\u2014provide valuable insights into how detectors perform when trained on one generator and tested on others, as well as how they handle low-quality images. This is particularly relevant given the findings of [55], which emphasized the importance of testing detectors under real-world social media conditions involving compression and resizing.\nAnother dataset, COCOFake [34], offers a large-scale collection of around 1.2 million images generated from COCO image-caption pairs using Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2.0. COCOFake is particularly useful for studying multimodal deepfake detection, as it links generated images with the captions used to create them. This allows researchers to explore how text prompts influence the characteristics and authenticity of generated images, aligning with the work in [7], which examined the interplay between text captions and image authenticity.\nFor facial forgery detection, the DiFF dataset [35] provides a collection of over 500,000 fake facial images synthesized by thirteen different generation methods. These images are created under diverse conditions using 30,000 carefully curated textual and visual prompts, ensuring high fidelity and semantic consistency. The dataset is particularly well-suited for evaluating detectors in scenarios that mimic realistic facial forgery, which is becoming increasingly difficult to detect as AI-generated faces grow more realistic. As emphasized by [9], the realism of AI-generated faces calls for detectors that remain robust under various image perturbations.\nTo test the generalizability of detectors, WildFake [36] compiles a diverse range of fake images generated by various state-of-the-art models, including diffusion models, GANs, and other generative techniques. WildFake\u2019s hierarchical structure, which organizes images by generator type, allows for a more targeted evaluation of detector performance. This dataset is particularly valuable for assessing how detectors generalize to unseen models and perform in real-world scenarios, where images can vary widely in class, style, and source, similar to the benchmark created in [17]."}, {"title": "B.

To fully evaluate the generalizability of detection methods, it is essential to develop datasets that encompass a broader spectrum of models, including both established and emerging architectures. This would help identify vulnerabilities specific to certain models and ensure detectors"}, {"title": "VI. EVALUATION METRICS", "content": "When evaluating diffusion-generated content detectors, several metrics from traditional classification tasks and generative model assessments come into play. This section explores both the standard metrics used in classification tasks and those specific to generative models, while also considering the need for new metrics to address the unique challenges posed by diffusion models."}, {"title": "A. Standard Classification Metrics", "content": "The effectiveness of detectors for diffusion-generated content is often measured using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve). Accuracy provides an overall measure of the detector's correctness, while precision and recall respectively quantify the system's ability to minimize false positives (classifying real content as generated) and false negatives (failing to detect generated content). The F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, is widely used to balance these two aspects. AUROC assesses the detector's performance across various thresholds.\nThese metrics are commonly used in studies such as [3], [31], and [8], with reported accuracies often exceeding 90%. However, while these metrics are useful for general performance assessment, they provide limited insight into the nuanced challenges of detecting diffusion-generated content, especially regarding the quality, subtlety, and real-world impact of generated outputs. For instance, a detector may achieve"}, {"title": "B. Generative Model-Specific Metrics", "content": "In addition to standard classification metrics, generative model-specific metrics like Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) offer a complementary perspective by quantifying the quality of generated images. FID measures the difference between the feature distributions of real and generated images, with a lower score indicating greater similarity. IS evaluates the quality and diversity of generated images. Both metrics have been widely adopted in evaluating generative models, though their relationship to detection performance remains complex.\nFor example, a low FID score suggests high-quality generative outputs, but these images may still contain detectable artifacts. [10] highlights how diffusion models sometimes replicate training data, which may artificially lower FID but potentially make detection easier. Moreover, emerging metrics like the Image Realism Score (IRS) [49] attempt to quantify the realism of images and distinguish between real and fake content, adding another dimension to the evaluation of diffusion models."}, {"title": "C. Emerging Needs for New Metrics", "content": "As diffusion models continue to evolve in complexity, new evaluation metrics are necessary to capture the specific attributes of their generated content. Existing metrics often fail to account for semantic consistency, such as the alignment between generated images and accompanying text prompts, which is crucial for text-to-image models [4]. Robustness to adversarial attacks and post-processing operations is another critical concern, particularly for real-world applications. [37] explores the vulnerability of detectors to various attacks, stressing the need for metrics that evaluate robustness and adversarial resistance.\nAdditionally, detection systems must consider application-specific contexts. For instance, the impact of generated content on human perception is crucial for assessing its real-world implications, as explored in [58]. Such factors underscore the need for more sophisticated and holistic evaluation frameworks that go beyond traditional metrics."}, {"title": "VII.

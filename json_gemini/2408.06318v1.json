{"title": "Can We Rely on LLM Agents to Draft Long-Horizon Plans?\nLet's Take TravelPlanner as an Example", "authors": ["Yanan Chen", "Ali Pesaranghader", "Tanmana Sadhu", "Dong Hoon Yi"], "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have brought\nautonomous agents closer to artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) due to their promising gen-\neralization and emergent capabilities. There\nis, however, a lack of studies on how LLM-\nbased agents behave, why they could poten-\ntially fail, and how to improve them, particu-\nlarly in demanding real-world planning tasks.\nIn this paper, as an effort to fill the gap, we\npresent our study using a realistic benchmark,\nTravelPlanner (Xie et al., 2024), where an agent\nmust meet multiple constraints to generate ac-\ncurate plans. We leverage this benchmark to ad-\ndress four key research questions: (1) are LLM\nagents robust enough to lengthy and noisy con-\ntexts when it comes to reasoning and planning?\n(2) can few-shot prompting adversely impact\nthe performance of LLM agents in scenarios\nwith long context? (3) can we rely on refine-\nment to improve plans, and (4) can fine-tuning\nLLMs with both positive and negative feedback\nlead to further improvement? Our comprehen-\nsive experiments indicate that, firstly, LLMs\noften fail to attend to crucial parts of a long\ncontext, despite their ability to handle exten-\nsive reference information and few-shot exam-\nples; secondly, they still struggle with analyz-\ning the long plans and cannot provide accurate\nfeedback for refinement; thirdly, we propose\nFeedback-Aware Fine-Tuning (FAFT), which\nleverages both positive and negative feedback,\nresulting in substantial gains over Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT). Our findings offer in-depth\ninsights to the community on various aspects\nrelated to real-world planning applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "LLMs have shown significant reasoning and plan-\ning results against various benchmarks such as\nWebArena (Zhou et al., 2023), WebShop (Yao et al.,\n2022a), AgentBench (Liu et al., 2023b) and Agent-\nGym (Xi et al., 2024b) where they act as agents\nto finish a given task on behalf of humans. In this\nvein, the community considers two main directions\nfor developing LLM-based agents: (1) prompting\nLLMs for reasoning, planning, and execution (Qin\net al., 2023; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2024; Wang\net al., 2022), and (2) fine-tuning LLMs for a given\ntask (Chen et al., 2023b; Zeng et al., 2023; Zhang\net al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2024; Song et al., 2024b).\nDespite promising contributions in each direction,\nit is seen that LLMs still fall short in more complex\nscenarios. TravelPlanner (Xie et al., 2024), as an ex-\nample, is a benchmark where an agent should gen-\nerate a plan which must meet multiple constraints\nwith respect to input queries. The authors showed\nthat GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) could only reach\nto Final Pass Rate of 4.4%. This indicates that LLM\nagents cannot handle long-horizon reasoning and\nplanning. In this paper, we investigate these chal-\nlenges further with four research questions using\nTravelPlanner as the benchmark, and we trust that\nour promising and negative findings will benefit\nthe community.\nOur extensive experiments indicate that (1)\nlengthy and noisy context can adversely impact\nplanning ability of the LLM agent, (2) more shots\ndo not necessarily guarantee performance improve-\nment, (3) refinement may not be effective when\nLLMs are employed as feedback generators; how-\never, it is more likely to work if the feedback gen-\nerator is based on heuristic rules, and (4) feedback-\naware fine-tuning (FAFT), our proposed approach,\ninspired by negative aware training (NAT) (Wang\net al., 2024b), can show remarkable improvement\nin planning."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Our framework, built upon TravelPlanner, consists\nof five main components: Scrubber, Planner, Feed-\nback Generator, Refiner, and the Evaluation mod-\nule (as shown in Fig. 1).

Since the focus of our work is on\nagents' capabilities in drafting plans, we only rely\non the Sole Planning setting from TravelPlanner.\nThat is, all comprehensive and necessary informa-\ntion, which are human annotations, is directly pro-\nvided to the planner agent. We also consider the\nDirect\u00b2 planning strategy for its simplicity because\nit performs at a similar level to other reasoning\ntechniques such as ZS-CoT (Wei et al., 2022), Re-\nAct (Yao et al., 2022b) and Reflexion (Shinn et al.,\n2024).\nDataset. (See Appx. A.1) We use the training set\nfor both few-shot prompting and fine-tuning be-\ncause it provides annotated plans. We evaluate the\nagent against both validation and test sets for RQ1\nand RQ2 in Section 4. As for RQ3, we consider\nonly the validation set because we do not have\naccess to the system feedback offline. Regarding\nRQ4, we use the training set for fine-tuning the\n(Open-LLM) planner agent."}, {"title": "4 Findings", "content": "RQ1: Are LLM agents robust enough to noisy\ninformation for reasoning and planning? Table 1\nshows that GPT-3.5-Turbo has a better performance\nwhen it receives shrunk reference information. This\nindicates that GPT-3.5-Turbo still struggles to at-\ntend to the most important parts of a given context\nfor reasoning, prone to excessive irrelevant (con-\ntext) chunks. Therefore, it is worth considering an\nexternal intelligent context-cleaning agent.\nRQ2: Can more shots help with the planning\ntask, or does it worsen hallucination? It is com-\nmonly accepted that having more few-shots is help-\nful in ICL, but does it apply to TravelPlanner? As\nTable 1 shows, the Final Pass rate reaches its high-\nest value when there are 2 shots, while having more\nshots may not improve if not hurt more. We pre-\nsume that more shots in the context window may\ndistract the LLM and lead to hallucination (e.g.,\nusing entities that do not exist in the given refer-\nence information). The results of the Hallucination\nRate attest to this assumption. That is, giving more\nshots may potentially cause severer hallucination\nin tasks where the context of the reference infor-\nmation is complex tabular texts. Another finding\nis that at least one in-context example is beneficial\n(Xie and Min, 2022). Finally, we conclude that as\nwe have more shots, the pass rate and hallucination\nrate results worsen.\nOur RQ1 and RQ2 observations align with the exist-\ning theoretical and experimental works, e.g., (Han\net al., 2023; Levy et al., 2024), which identify the\npotential causes underlying current LLMs' failure\nin length generalization, that when they encounter\na much longer context, the attention scores are di-\nluted, and thus the score distribution becomes flat\nleading to information loss. That is, the entropy\nof the attention score will explode with increasing\ncontext. In other words, LLMs become lost in how\nto focus on the right information, especially when\npre-training is done on shorter text segments.\nRQ3: Can we rely on refinement to improve\nplans? To address this, we require feedback that\nhighlights what went wrong, accompanied by ex-\nplanations of the reasons behind the issues. For that,"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we studied the impacts of context, the\nnumber of shots, and the utilization of feedback\non a complex long-horizon planning task known\nas TravelPlanner. Our findings aim to advance a\nbroader spectrum of agentic frameworks and strate-\ngies within the research community.\nFor future work, we plan to explore methods\nthat incorporate annotated shots in SFT and post-\ntraining. This approach can address the bottleneck\nwhere LLMs' knowledge and skills are predom-\ninantly acquired during pre-training, while align-\nment SFT teaches the model which sub-distribution\nof formats to use when interacting with users (Zhou\net al., 2024a). Finally, we will explore the interplay\nbetween RLHF and FAFT."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Due to budget constraints, we were only able to use\nGPT-3.5-Turbo as the Planner agent for RQ1 and\nRQ2.

The anno-\ntations are used as demonstrations for in-context\nlearning or supervised fine-tuning in our paper.\nPlease note that these annotated plans are merely\na subset of many feasible plans. As expected,\nthe Oracle (i.e., system) returns the feedback for\nthe annotations where no issue is raised (Appx.\nA.6.2).\n\u2022 The Validation Set comes with 180 pairs of\nquery and reference, with no annotated plans.\n\u2022 The Test Set holds 1,000 queries together with\ntheir references, without any annotated plans.\nFor a given query, agents are expected to formu-\nlate a (comprehensive) plan which includes trans-\nportation, restaurants, attractions, and accommoda-\ntion for each day (Appx. A.6.1 shows an example).\nA.2 Evaluation metrics\nFollowing TravelPlanner, we use automatic evalua-\ntion metrics to assess whether a plan generated by\nthe agent meets the (correct) format condition as\nwell as all the constraints.\n\u2022 Delivery Rate measures whether the agent could\nsuccessfully generate a plan within a limited num-\nber of steps. Falling into any dead loops or in-\nvalid plan formats leads to failure. In the sole-\nplanning setting, any failure in drafting a plan\nnegatively impacts the delivery rate.\n\u2022 Commonsense Constraint Pass Rate assesses\nwhether the agent can incorporate commonsense\nwhile drafting plans without explicit instructions.\nFor example, the agent has to pick valid entities\n(incl. restaurants, hotels, etc.) from the reference\ninformation and not hallucinate.\n\u2022 Hard Constraint Pass Rate measures whether\na plan meets all hard constraints mentioned in\nthe query, e.g., budget limit, cuisine preference,\nor accommodation type.\nN.B. For Commonsense and Hard Constraint\nPass Rates, the evaluation is done in two ways,\nMicro and Macro, which evaluate the agent's\ncapability of following individual constraints vs.\nall the constraints holistically (Xie et al., 2024).\n\u2022 Final Pass Rate measures whether a plan satis-\nfies all hard and commonsense constraints.\n\u2022 Hallucination Rate measures whether a plan\ncontains entities that cannot be found in the ref-\nerence information."}, {"title": "A.3 Framework", "content": "In Fig. 1, we show that the Planner agent generates\na plan for a given query and (cleaned) reference in-\nformation.

There are 5\nhard constraints: Room Rule, Room Type, Cuisine,\nBudget and Transportation. We let the Scrubber\nto predict the exact constraint value based on the\nquery, for example, one or several cuisine prefer-\nences from the set: {American, Chinese, French,\nIndian, Italian, Mediterranean, Mexican}. In-\nternally within the Scrubber, we inject the whole\ntraining set as few-shot examples on top of the test\nquery, to improve the accuracy.

{"title": "Optimizing Airline Reservation Systems with Edge-Enabled Microservices: A Framework for Real-Time Data Processing and Enhanced User Responsiveness", "authors": ["Biman Barua", "M. Shamim Kaiser"], "abstract": "The growing complexity of the operations of airline reservations requires a smart solution for the adoption of novel approaches to the development of quick, efficient, and adaptive reservation systems. This paper outlines in detail a conceptual framework for the implementation of edge computing microservices in order to address the shortcomings of traditional centralized architectures. Specifically, as edge computing allows for certain activities such as seat inventory checks, booking processes and even confirmation to be done nearer to the user, thus lessening the overall response time and improving the performance of the system.\nIn addition, the framework value should include achieving the high performance of the system such as low latency, high throughput and higher user experience. The major design components include deployed distributed computing microservices orchestrated by Kubernetes, real-time message processing system with Kafka and its elastic scaling. Other operational components include Prometheus and Grafana, which are used to monitor and manage resources, ensuring that all operational processes are optimized.\nAlthough this research focuses on a design and theoretical scheming of the framework, its use is foreseen to be more advantageous in facilitating a transform in the provision of services in the airline industry by improving customers' satisfaction, providing infrastructure which is cheap to install and efficiently supporting technology changes such as artificial intelligence and internet of things embedded systems. In addition, the framework can also be useful in other processing areas that require real time like supply chain management, health care systems and in the management of smart cities.\nThis research addresses the increasing demand for new technologies with modern well-distributed and real-time- centric systems and also provides a basis for future case implementation and testing. As such, the proposed architecture offers a market-ready, extensible solution to the problems posed by existing airline reservation systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1. Background", "content": "One of the indispensable factors in the aviation sector is the airline reservation systems (ARS) which allows the booking and management of flight reservations. These systems have gone through a number of phases starting with manual processes and moving to the present digitalized platform which combines various services like ticketing, scheduling and customer management. Nevertheless, the ARS has its own challenges.\nLatency: The need for real-time data processing is critical in an ARS in order to provide the most current information on the availability of flights, their prices and schedules. High latency may cause the delay in booking confirmations thereby upsetting the customers. Conventional centralized structures often find it hard to satisfy such real-time needs leading to longer response times [4].\nData Loss: An ARS processes and provides a lot of information from several sources such as boarders' data, flight scheduling data, and their pricing data. The problem arises when there is a need to process that data in a timely and efficient manner. However, older systems may have limitations and systems cannot outperform during data fetching which causes delays leading to information processing [3]."}, {"title": "Scalability:", "content": "The operations of most ARS will need to scale because of the trends in the airline business and the demand for travel that will not be constant at all times. Old-fashioned architectures come in handy to many people, whom are unable to independently serve the components of the system on the demand. This inflexibility can cause either system failure or poor quality of service provided in certain periods [1].\nTackling these challenges is imperative for improving the performance and dependability of airline booking systems. Contemporary architectural styles like microservices and edge computing can help in making systems more adaptable, scalable and quicker to respond, all of which can be helpful [2]."}, {"title": "1.2. Problem Statement", "content": "The conventional Airline Reservation Systems (ARS) also put emphasis on monolithic systems which have delineated various difficulties in meeting the real time challenges and providing the desired user interactivity [5]. In these systems, the components are largely interdependent which leads to the following defects:\nScalability Issues: Monolithic designs have difficulty in scaling as expansion means copying the whole system instead of particular parts. This can be wasting resources and heightening operational expenses especially during the seasons of high demand travel.\nLatency and Performance Bottlenecks: Inbuilt performance and latency constraints associated with systems of built in components. Performance degradation in one component of the system affects the whole system due to the interconnections. This leads to inter-component waiting time and decreased user experience due to slower responses of the system [1].\nLimited Flexibility and Agility: Due to the nature of these systems, once updates or new features have to be installed in the systems, the whole application has to be put off and redeployed after the changes have been made. This limits reconsideration of the current conditions to changing conditions posed by users and marketing activities [6].\nMaintenance and Reliability Challenges: Maintaining monolithic system is difficult because of the maintenance or the architecture itself. When one module fails, the whole system fails, thus removing system reliability availability for the reservation service [7].\nIt is important to overcome these drawbacks in order to better the performance as well as the satisfaction of the users from airline reservation systems. Moving to a slightly more modular and scalable approach like microservices and edge computing to address real time process requirements is an encouraging approach."}, {"title": "1.3. Objectives", "content": "The main aim of this research is to create a competent system based on edge computing and microservices architecture to mitigate the issues encountered in conventional integrated reservation systems of airlines. In this case, a lot of attention is on the factors of scalability, latency, and user responsiveness [8]. The research intends to achieve the following objectives:\nImprove System Scalability: In this case, a microservices based architecture will be deployed to enhance system scalability, which will allow the components of the airline reservation system to be scaled up or down depending on the size of the pooled resources without causing wastage.\nReduce Latency through Edge Computing: Implementation of edge computing whereby there is data processing at the edge of the network as opposed to the center so that end users do not take long to have the relevant data or even transfer it. This is aimed at alleviating the challenges of such networks during peak usage periods.\nImprove User Responsiveness and Experience: The framework will be designed to ensure minimal waiting time by clustering the processing away from the end users and managing the real time data very efficiently for the benefit of the users and making booking easy and quick."}, {"title": "Increase Flexibility and Adaptability:", "content": "With microservices, this research intends to allow design where services can be altered or changed without affecting the whole system design. This flexibility helps in progressive enhancement in meeting the current user requirements.\nOptimizing Operational Costs and Reliability: Due to edge computing and the fact that the system is distributed, it is possible that the system achieves greater reliability because of decreased reliance on centralized servers which may also reduce costs in terms of using dedicated servers because of the risk of them incurring downtime.\nThe expectation is that this design will resolve the existing constraints in present day airline reservation systems by leveraging the benefits of both edge computing and microservices to create a system that is flexible and responsive to real-time requests."}, {"title": "1.4. Contributions", "content": "This paper presents some important advancements in the studies of airline reservation systems and distributed computer systems:\n1.4.1. Proposed Edge-Enabled Microservices Framework\nDeveloped an advanced system architecture which combines edge computing and microservices to overcome the challenges related to the handling of real time airline reservation activities with a centralised system.\nThe architecture addresses the need for low latency and higher responsiveness by delegating time sensitive computations to edge nodes while using cloud backends to ensure global data coherency.\n1.4.2.

Literature Review", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1. Existing Reservation System Technologies", "content": "Given the increasing technological penetration in systems used for airlines reservation, the airline industry has greatly changed the way it handles bookings management, inventory control and the services offered to the customers. In the past, such systems have progressed from manually operated systems, to modern automated systems which increases operational speed and customer satisfaction.\nTraditional Computer Reservation Systems (CRS): In the Initial stages, airlines used Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) to organize their flight schedules, look for seat availability and record bookings. These systems contained reservation databases of all the interested parties and allowed the agent using it to see the information in that database in real time. For example, the SABRE system invented in the1950s was one of the first systems of this type and it allowed implementing B2C sales and carrying out inventories [19].\nGlobal Distribution Systems (GDS): With growth in the airline sector, there was a demand for even wider distribution and thus Global Distribution Systems were created. GDS systems such as Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport combined the reservation system of numerous airlines in a single tower for use by travel agents to enhance access to the respective airlines and their packages [17]. These systems allowed airlines and travel companies to communicate easier and hence made the booking process more efficient.\nPassenger Service Systems (PSS): In the present day, airlines use all-encompassing Passenger Service Systems (PSS) which includes different modules like reservation, inventory control, departure control and customer management among others. PSS systems are designed to be fully operative in managing all passenger services, increasing operational productivity and customer delight [21]. Take for instance the Amadeus Alt\u00e9a Suite which offers airline reservation, inventory management and departure control system management tools in all aspects to the airline industry [13].\nMicroservices Architecture: At present, most of the airline systems have evolved to adopting the microservices architecture that allows for better system scalability, flexibility, and even resilience. This method allows development teams to take large, complex lumps of code known as monoliths, and break them down into smaller services, which work independently and can be developed, deployed and scaled even on their own [14]. Such architectures support continuous integration and continuous deployment of the system, enabling the airlines to quickly adapt to market changes as well as the needs of the clientele [15]. For instance, a company called Radixx designed a PSS for low-cost carriers based on microservices, thus it is incorporated with a flexible scalable design [9].\nCloud-Based Solutions: The revolution of cloud computing has provided yet another advancement in the operating airlines reservation system. These are the systems that are based on the cloud which are very scalable, cheap, and secure [10]. Cloud computing allows airlines to run their reservation, payment, and even the storage of passenger information on the internet efficiently. As an example, this kind of service is offered by AWS who has serverless architectures for companies in the airline industry where they can create a reservation system for their clients without the need for many services [11]."}, {"title": "2.2. Microservices Architecture in Distributed Systems", "content": "Microservice architectecture is becoming increasingly popular in the area of distributed systems. This is because it is easier to separate applications into smaller deployable components that can each serve a business function [12]. This means that these services can also be developed and consumed using lightweight protocols thus making it possible to use different technologies in the same application [25].\nDeployed microservices have the following advantages over monolithic deployment: the most obvious ones are superior scalability, improved fault isolation and over all increased agility. Services on their own can be adjusted to different levels of scale based on varying requirements, hence ensuring better utilization of resources and operational efficiency of the whole system [16]. In addition, fault isolation is another main advantage provided that failure of one service does very little to other services increasing the overall reliability of the system [26]. Microservices also"}, {"title": "enhance agility in development as diverse teams can deploy and update services installed on the system in no time, therefore launching new features within less time [23].", "content": null}, {"title": "Drawbacks and Difficulties in Implementing Microservices:", "content": "However, that doesn't mean that the microservices architecture can be used without challenges [18]. As the number of services increases, there is a need to control the level of complexity by devising better communication and management of data across the services [20]. This challenge leads to difficulty in the maintenance of data consistency across the geodistributed services [28]. Additionally implementation of testing and debugging is difficult because of the distribution of the microservices and this requires the use of high complex testing strategies and tools [29]."}, {"title": "2.3. Edge Computing in Data Processing", "content": "The need for low latency and high responsiveness has made the distributed system paradigm known as edge computing quite appealing. Edge computing seeks to eliminate the challenges of transmitting excessive amounts of data to the centralized cloud servers by carrying out data processing closer to the source [37]. In this paradigm, the offloaded computational capacity is either in devices or local servers that are located close to the data source for efficient processing and insights retrieval [36]."}, {"title": "2.3.1. Role of Edge Computing in Reducing Latency", "content": "Latency reduction is one factor that drives the adoption of edge computing in most industries. In a typical cloud computing model, which is centralized, the user may need to send data and that data may be stored miles away. It, therefore, leads to latencies when the data is being retrieved. When edge computing is utilized, data is processed at the point of its origin, in that case drawing out the latency levels that are common with many retrievals [40]. Considering for instance, industries like transportation or healthcare, where every second on decision making counts edge computing facilitates \u2018on the spot' processing thereby enhancing safety and efficiency in the operations [24] [33]."}, {"title": "2.3.2.\nImproving Real-Time Data Processing", "content": "This is further enhanced by the edge computing model which allows advanced data analytics to be performed with minimum dependence on the network bandwidth and with almost immediate availability of relevant information [38]. This is important in the case a network is intermittently connected or where the network is less resourceful. In smart cities, for traffic control for example, edge devices can be embedded in the system such that data is processed on the device and does not require any central control to implement adaptive signal control or real-time traffic management [34]."}, {"title": "2.4. Gaps in Existing Research", "content": "The combination of edge computing and microservices in airline reservation systems is still in its infancy and therefore has quite a number of research gaps:\nLimited Adoption of Edge Computing in Airline Systems: Most airline reservation systems are designed and operated on either a central or cloud based configuration resulting in latency and inefficiencies especially during the busy periods [22]. However, edge computing has been applied in a few other areas and therefore there are challenges in reviewing the existing literature especially within the airline sector [45].\nFragmented Microservices Architectures: One of the prevalent challenges with regard to most of the airline systems that has embraced microservices is that they focus on the vertical and horizontal extensibility of components and edges without connecting to the central edgenodes that minimizes the latency and improves the time critical functions [35]. The communication barrier between the edges and the microservices creates limitations in embracing the use of edge computing [46].\nChallenges in Real-Time Data Synchronization: Most of the available research considers the scalability of the microservices, forgetting the issue of how the edges and the core system work together maintaining live data without synchronization faults. This has a negative effect on the system that in turn creates problems in having the users receive the most current and real-time updates on flight status, availability and pricing of seats [31]."}, {"title": "Insufficient Focus on Passenger-Centric Performance Metrics:", "content": "In most cases such work centers on the efficient functioning of the system and lowering the costs, whereas there is little attention to such indicators as the user interaction and their experience with the system, which are important for airline ticketing systems [27].\nLimited Case Studies and Experimental Data: Few if any case studies and experimental setups exist that exemplify how edge computing and microservices can be effectively combined in the context of, for example, an airline ticket purchase. Rather, the majority present the theoretical perspective, leaving practical realization or assessment of actual systems unaddressed [30]."}, {"title": "3.

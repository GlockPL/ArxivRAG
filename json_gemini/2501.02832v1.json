These models describe how inputs affect system states and how states generate output, using the following equations:\n$h_{t+1} = A(h_t) + B(x_t), y_t = C(h_t)$\nwhere $h_t$ is the latent state at time t, $x_t$ is the input, $y_t$ is the output, and A, B, C are parameter matrices. This formulation allows SSMs to efficiently model sequential data by transitioning between latent states and producing outputs influenced by both current and historical inputs.\nTraditionally, SSMs are linear time invariant (LTI), where A, B, C remain constant over time. Although LTI dynamics provides computational efficiency and stability, they limit the model's ability to adapt to input-dependent variations. Consequently, classical SSMs often struggle with complex, context-sensitive tasks, especially in discrete and content-rich modalities such as language.\nThe matrices A, B,and C are learned parameters with the following interpretations.\n\u2022 A: Determines how much the previous hidden state $h_t$ should be considered to calculate the new hidden state $h_{t+1}$.\n\u2022 B: Determines how much the input $x_t$ should be considered to calculate the new hidden state $h_{t+1}$.\n\u2022 C: Determines how much the hidden state $h_t$ should be considered in calculating the output $Y_t$."}, {"title": "1.1.2 Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces", "content": "Mamba[6] extends traditional SSMs with a selectivity mechanism, addressing the limitations of LTI dynamics while preserving computational efficiency.

This hybrid design addresses limitations of pure Transformer models in handling long contexts and computational efficiency. The resulting model, Jamba, achieves performance comparable to Mixtral-8x7B while supporting an unprecedented context length of 256,000 tokens the longest among production-grade models. Jamba's efficiency is remarkable, delivering three times the throughput of Mixtral-8x7B for long contexts and operating within a single 80GB GPU. This demonstrates the potential of integrating Transformer's attention mechanisms with Mamba's efficient state-space dynamics for enhanced performance and resource utilization.\nFalcon Mamba[3] on the other hand, showcases the capabilities of a pure Mamba-based language model. This 7B parameter model trained on 5.8 trillion tokens challenges the notion that attention mechanisms are necessary for competitive performance. Surpassing open-weight Transformer-based models like Mistral 7B and Falcon2 11B, Falcon Mamba demonstrates that efficient inference and constant memory costs are achievable across context lengths. By addressing training stability issues with strategic initializations and RMSNorm placements, Falcon Mamba establishes itself as a competitive and efficient alternative to hybrid architectures.\nZamba[4] represents another leap in Mamba-based innovation by combining a Mamba backbone with a unique shared attention module. This 7B parameter model achieves competitive performance against leading transformer-based models while maintaining SSM efficiency. With faster inference speeds and reduced memory requirements, Zamba stands out as a resource-efficient model, particularly for generating long sequences. Although slightly behind in reasoning and in-context learning tasks due to limited training data, Zamba demonstrates the viability of hybrid SSM-attention designs for large-scale modeling.\nIn vision tasks, Vision Mamba (Vim)[10] adapts Mamba for visual representation learning, demonstrating that self-attention mechanisms are not essential for effective vision modeling. Vim introduces bidirectional Mamba blocks to address positional awareness and global context challenges in vision tasks. The model delivers superior performance on benchmarks like ImageNet and COCO, achieving 2.8\u00d7 faster inference speeds on high-resolution images compared to transformer-based models such as DeiT[11], while reducing GPU memory usage by 86.8%.

Its architecture comprises three main components: the feature encoder, quantization module, and Transformer encoder. The feature encoder processes raw audio waveforms using a series of convolutional layers that extract latent speech representations by down sampling the input while retaining critical temporal features. The quantization module discretizes these latent representations into a finite set of learned speech units using product quantization, which is crucial for self-supervised learning objectives. The Transformer encoder, a core part of the architecture, captures long-range dependencies in the audio data by contextualizing the extracted features through multi-layer attention mechanisms. During pretraining, a contrastive loss is employed by masking a portion of the feature encoder's output and predicting the corresponding quantized representations, allowing the model to learn contextual speech representations effectively. In downstream tasks, such as speech-to-text generation, Wav2Vec2 is fine-tuned with labeled audio-text data, leveraging the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss to map audio features directly to text sequences. This approach has demonstrated exceptional performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR), making Wav2Vec2 a foundational model in related works on ASR and audio-based sequence generation tasks."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Conformer", "content": "The Conformer[14] architecture has emerged as a significant advancement in speech processing models, particularly for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It is designed to improve the extraction of both local and global features from audio signals by combining the strengths of convolutional networks and transformer-based attention mechanisms. This hybrid approach enables Conformer to achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks requiring the understanding of sequential audio data, such as speech recognition. The core strength of the Conformer lies in its ability to effectively model both short-term and long-term dependencies, a challenge typically faced by traditional models relying on either convolutions or attention mechanisms alone.\nThe preprocessing stage of the Conformer model begins with a convolutional subsampling layer. This initial step reduces the input sequence length by down sampling the feature maps, which not only reduces computational complexity but also retains essential information while discarding irrelevant details. The convolutional layer captures local patterns in the audio signal, which is crucial for preserving fine-grained temporal information. The output of this stage is then passed onto the main encoder, where the core feature extraction takes place.\nIn the encoder, the audio data is processed by a sequence of Conformer blocks, each of which comprises four key modules: a feed-forward module (FFN), a multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) module, a convolution module, and a second FFN module. The MHSA module is responsible for capturing global contextual relationships within the input sequence, leveraging relative positional encoding to manage varying sequence lengths. This helps the model generalize better across different input sizes. The use of pre-norm residual connections in the MHSA module allows for stable and efficient training, as layer normalization is applied before the attention mechanism, followed by a residual connection that aids in gradient flow during training.\nThe Conformer architecture combines convolutional and attention mechanisms to enhance speech recognition. By integrating these components, the model is able to handle varying input lengths while preserving both local and global features in the audio signal. The design, which uses a sandwich structure of different modules, helps balance feature extraction and computational efficiency. This makes Conformer a valuable approach for speech recognition tasks and other speech processing applications."}, {"title": "2.1.3 Whisper", "content": "The Whisper model[2] is built on a sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture, which is designed to handle various speech processing tasks such as transcription, translation, voice activity detection, and language identification. The input to the model is an 80-channel log-magnitude Mel spectrogram derived from raw audio, re-sampled at 16 kHz. The spectrogram is computed using 25-millisecond windows with a 10-millisecond stride, which captures the essential features of the audio signal. The model processes these features through a convolutional stem followed by a stack of Transformer blocks to learn meaningful representations of the speech signal.\nThe encoder processes the Mel spectrograms through two initial convolutional layers followed by Transformer blocks. The convolution layers with GELU activation reduce the dimensionality of the spectrogram and capture local patterns, while the Transformer layers are responsible for extracting global temporal dependencies in the audio. The encoder also includes sinusoidal position embeddings, which help the model learn the temporal structure of the audio input. The encoder's output is a sequence of contextualized representations that capture the relevant acoustic and linguistic information from the audio.\nThe decoder takes the encoder's output and generates text sequences, such as transcriptions or translations, depending on the task. It uses learned position embeddings and a set of special tokens to specify the task (e.g., transcription, translation). The decoder is trained to predict the next token in the sequence, conditioned on both the previously predicted tokens and the input audio features. The model is trained in a multitask setup, enabling it to perform multiple tasks like multilingual transcription and translation with a single unified architecture. The decoder ends with a special end of transcription token, marking the end of the output sequence.\nThus, by using a Transformer-based architecture to handle various speech recognition tasks Whisper model processes Mel spectrograms through an encoder to capture audio features and then uses a decoder to generate text.

The audio file is decoded, down-mixed if necessary, and resampled to a fixed sample rate of 16 kHz, ensuring all audio inputs are in the same format, which is essential for uniform processing. Error handling is implemented to deal with any issues arising during the loading process, such as file format incompatibility or unsupported codecs. The loaded audio is then normalized to a range of [-1, 1] to facilitate model training. To ensure that the audio inputs match the expected size for processing, they are either padded or trimmed to a specific length $N_{samples}$, defined by the model's requirements. This step is critical to maintain consistency in the length of audio segments processed by the encoder[20]. The choice of padding or trimming helps maintain the sequence length across all input samples, enabling efficient batch processing during training. Once the audio data is standardized, it is converted into a log-Mel spectrogram[21], which captures frequency content and time dynamics. This is done by applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) [22] to the audio waveform and projecting it onto the Mel filterbanks. The resulting magnitude spectrogram is then converted to a logarithmic scale to better match human auditory perception. This transformation enhances the discriminative power of the features, making them more suitable for speech recognition tasks. The spectrograms are further scaled to a range that ensures numerical stability and are normalized before being fed into the ASR model, facilitating accurate training and inference."}, {"title": "3.1 Tokenizer", "content": "The tokenizer is designed for the Mamba ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model, which converts textual input into a sequence of token IDs suitable for processing by the model.

It begins by embedding the input tokens (representing the partially transcribed text) and adding positional embeddings to ensure the order of the sequence is preserved. These embeddings are then processed through a series of Mamba blocks, similar to the encoder. However, here, the decoder is conditioned on the encoded audio features via a Mamba-cross-connection mechanism. This allows the decoder to focus on the relevant portions of the audio sequence while predicting each token, which is essential for accurate transcription.\nIn Transformer-based models like Wav2Vec2 and Whisper, the encoder directly feeds the decoder, and the self-attention mechanism captures the relationship between the audio features and the generated text. In contrast, Mamba ASR's Mamba-cross-connection mechanism enables more targeted alignment between the audio and text features, improving the model's ability to focus on specific audio segments that are most relevant to the current token being predicted. This targeted cross-connection mechanism helps the decoder refine the text representations, integrating both the audio context and previously predicted tokens.\nAfter passing through the Mamba blocks, a final Layer Normalization is applied, and the output is projected onto the vocabulary space via a linear layer followed by a softmax function[24]. This produces a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary, from which the model selects the most likely next token. To maintain the autoregressive nature of text generation, a causal mask ensures that predictions are based only on past tokens.\nThe unique use of Mamba blocks in the decoder enables Mamba ASR to model the intricate relationship between audio features and text tokens effectively, addressing the complex alignment problem in ASR while also being computationally efficient."}, {"title": "5 Dataset", "content": "To train Samba-ASR, we utilized a diverse set of high-quality speech datasets.

This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMS may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems evolve, they increasingly approximate human-like perception, incorporating more sophisticated sensory modalities beyond text. Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like text, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification), reasoning, and natural language generation (e.g., translation, question-answering) (OpenAI, 2024; Touvron et al., 2023; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022, inter alia). These models exhibit strong in-context learning (ICL) ability, quickly adapting to new tasks with few examples (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Dong et al., 2023), allowing them to achieve promising performance across numerous downstream tasks.\nBuilding on the foundation laid by LLMs, the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represents a significant step towards mimicking human perception.

Among the various forms of stereotyping, our work focuses on two types: perceived variability (homogeneity bias) and trait associations.\nPerceived variability refers to the extent to which members of a group are perceived as heterogeneous or diverse. For a long time, perceived variability has been studied within the intergroup context, with most of them providing support for the hypothesis that individuals tend to perceive their outgroup as more homogeneous than their ingroup (Judd et al., 1991; Mullen and Hu, 1989; Linville et al., 1989, 1986). However, subsequent research has explored perceived variability in terms of group status and power, where both dominant and subordinate groups see the subordinate group as more homogeneous than the dominant group (Guinote et al., 2002; Lorenzi-Cioldi, 1998; Fiske, 1993).\nTrait association refers to the belief that certain groups are differentially associated with specific traits or occupations (e.g., men with doctors, and women with nurse). To systematically understand the associations that come into play when we perceive individuals based on group membership, social psychologists have proposed models of stereotype content such as the Stereotype Content Model (Fiske et al., 2002) and the ABC model of stereotype content (Koch et al., 2016), each proposing distinct dimensions of stereotype content. Trait associations are closely linked to perceived variability, as weaker trait associations correlate with higher perceived variability within a group. Consequently, the two forms of stereotyping have often been used interchangeably in psychological research (Brauer and Er-rafiy, 2011; Linville, 1998).\nPsychological research has extensively examined how prototypicality \u2013 the degree to which an individual's features are representative of the stereotypical characteristics of their group \u2013 affects stereotyping. Studies have consistently demonstrated that individuals who are rated as more prototyp-ical of their group identity are subject to increased stereotyping (e.g., Ma et al., 2018; Livingston and Brewer, 2002; Blair et al., 2002; Maddox and Gray, 2002; Anderson and Cromwell, 1977). For example, Maddox and Gray (2002) found that when participants were asked to list traits to describe darker-skinned and lighter-skinned Black individuals, they were more likely to list Black-stereotypic traits in response to darker-skinned individuals, suggesting that more prototypical faces evoke stronger category judgments, which in turn lead to stronger trait associations and less perceived variability. While these phenomena are well-documented in psychological research, the extent to which vision language models (VLMs) reproduce homogeneity bias and trait associations, as well as the impact of prototypicality on model stereotyping, remains largely unexplored in the literature."}, {"title": "2.2 Stereotyping in Language and Vision-Language Models", "content": "Language models inadvertently reproduce and, possibly, amplify human-like biases (Bender et al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020).

We used Sentence-BERT models for the encoding task, models that have been fine-tuned on pre-trained encoder models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and ROBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) to yield higher quality sentence embeddings that are better suited for similarity assessments (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). We used three Sentence-BERT models from the sentence-transformers package in python (python version 3.11.5): all-mpnet-base-v2, all-distilroberta-v1, and all-MiniLM-L12-v2. We discuss model selection in Section A.3 of the Supplementary Materials. As pinpointing the exact sources of variation between these models was difficult due to their complexity, we analyzed their collective output trends to interpret the results.\nWe used mixed-effects models including race and mean prototypicality of the images as fixed effects (Race and Prototypicality model). The prototypicality ratings of the images were from the CFD where participants were asked to rate the extent to which the physical features of the individual in the image resembled the features of their racial group. The ratings were on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 indicating low prototypicality and 5 indicating high prototypicality. Furthermore, we predicted that the effect of prototypicality on the homogeneity of GPT-4V-generated texts would be greater for African Americans than White Americans. To test this, we fitted another mixed-effects model including the interaction between race and mean prototypicality as fixed effects (Interaction model).\nFor all models, we included Pair ID, a unique identifier of the pair of image stimuli used to calculate cosine similarity, as random intercepts as we expected the cosine similarity baseline to vary by image pair but not the magnitude and direction of the effects of race and/or mean prototypicality.

Each word is assigned a probability that it belongs to each topic, and each document is assigned a probability that it consists of each topic. STMs enable modeling of topic prevalence as a function of document-level metadata, facilitating our analysis of how race influences the trait associations made by the VLM.

In Study 2, texts associated with feminine faces exhibited more homogeneity. This phenomenon can be explained by societal perceptions that associate femininity with lower agency, traits often linked with conformity and less autonomy (Hsu et al., 2021; Eagly et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "5.2 Perceived Femininity Disproportionately Affects Men", "content": "In Study 2, the effect of femininity on homogeneity bias was significantly greater for men than women. On one hand, this finding could be attributed to societal attitudes towards gender role transgressions, which are generally more negative for men than for women (McCreary, 1994; Martin, 1990; Feinman, 1984). That is, feminine men face more negative attitudes and stereotyping compared to masculine women, leading to a pronounced effect of femininity in men. Furthermore, under-representation of feminine men in VLM training data may contribute to this phenomenon. The femininity ratings of White men in the CFD exhibit a significant right skew (see Figure A.4 in the Supplementary Materials), indicating that feminine faces of men are likely under-represented.

Other associations reflected real-world disparities. For examples, White Americans and men were more associated with stars and software development than African Americans and women, respectively, highlighting under-representation of these groups in astronomy (Ivie et al., 2014; Caplar et al., 2017), and software development (Lazonick et al., 2022; Statista, 2020).\nFurthermore, we found trait associations that deviated from reality. For example, women were more associated with firefighting than men despite it being a predominantly male profession (Fahy et al., 2022). We attribute such oddities to Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback, where limitations of the technique (for a detailed discussion see Casper et al., 2023) may introduce new biases.

The cause of AMR is considered\nrelated to antibiotic production either in a natural environment or by synthetic processes and the\nimpact of antibiotics on bacteria evolution. However, it is challenging to quantify factors affecting\nAMR transmissions for effective decision-making. As the data related to AMR has been increasingly\ncollected, data-driven methods have been increasingly used and are promising in providing mean-\ningful clues for identifying AMR causes and effective treatment methods. In this paper, we review\nAMR works from the data analytics and machine learning perspective, in an attempt to summarise\nthe state-of-the-art and give insight into the problem space. In more detail, we explore the diverse as-\npects of AMR, including surveillance, prediction, drug discovery, stewardship, and driver analysis.\nThen, we elaborate on the interaction of these aspects and the common data-related methodologies\nemployed. For data handling, we have discussed sources, methods, and challenges in collecting\nand analyzing AMR-related data, while underlining the importance of standardization and interop-\nerability. Further, this article surveys data analysis techniques, from statistical analysis to machine\nlearning/deep learning, illustrating their application in tackling AMR challenges. Mainly aiming\nat data challenges, including noises and biases introduced in data preparation (e.g., data cleaning\nand privacy-preserving) and modelling phases, the paper also highlights strategies (i.e., denoising\nand debiasing) for mitigating data challenges to improve AMR research performance and results in\nterms of fairness and robustness. In conclusion, the paper focuses on problems in the intersection\nof AMR and data science, stressing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, especially arousing\nthe awareness of noise and bias in data-driven approaches in the ongoing battle against AMR.

AMR prediction can be used to optimise the prescription of antibiotics. For example, Weis\net al. [96] applied the machine learning method to clinical mass spectra data, enabling efficient and low-cost microbial\nidentification. Their method reduces the time of AMR diagnostics compared to the conventional culture-based method,\nenabling precise antibiotic prescriptions.\nThe predominant data type used in AMR prediction centers around the genomic sequence data, with a particular em-\nphasis on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Arango-Argoty et al. [7] showcase the use of manually curated ARG\ndatabases, combining from public sources like the UniProt (Universal Protein Resource Database) [6], CARD (Com-\nprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) [41] and ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) [52]. Weis et al."}, {"title": "Antimicrobial Stewardship", "content": "While AMR prediction focuses on predicting the likelihood of a specific microorganism being resistant to a particular\nantibiotic, antimicrobial stewardship refers to a collection of coordinated interventions designed to optimise the use of\nantimicrobials to achieve the best clinical outcomes. It aims to minimize adverse effects, reduce antibiotic resistance,\nand reduce the cost. These interventions aim to optimise antimicrobial drug regimens by ensuring the selection of\nthe most appropriate drug, dose, duration, and route of administration. In this context, the use of machine learning\ntechniques has gained increasing importance in enhancing antimicrobial stewardship efforts.\nThe primary data sources used by these machine learning methods are electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs pro-\nvide comprehensive and detailed patient information, which is essential for developing accurate predictive models.\nSeveral studies have leveraged EHR data to build and test their models [43, 47, 11, 67]. Additionally, other data\nsources have also been utilized. For instance, Yelin et al. [104] used data from Maccabi Healthcare Services, which\nincluded community- and retirement home-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs). Antimicrobial stewardship can\nhave different focuses, for example, Beaudoin et al. [11] targeted the prediction of inappropriate prescriptions of\npiperacillin-tazobactam. They applied a temporal induction of classification models for the clinical decision support\nsystem and this method allowed for identifying patterns in prescription data over time. Building on another objective\nof reducing prescription errors, Lee et al. [47] utilized a hybrid method combining a rule-based approach with an\nadvanced deep neural network for robust and accurate prescription error prediction. In another study, Yelin et al. [104]\naimed to predict mismatched treatments, defined as instances when the sample is resistant to the prescribed antibiotic,\nby leveraging logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient-boosting decision trees on personal clinical history data.\nOonsivilai et al. [67] expanded the scope to include predicting susceptibility to antibiotics by applying a comprehen-\nsive set of machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, GBDTs, support\nvector machines (SVMs), and K-nearest neighbours (KNNs) to guide empiric antibiotic prescribing. Extending the\nfocus on prescription accuracy, Kanjilal et al. [43] focused on the proportion of recommendations not only for inap-\npropriate antibiotic therapies but also for second-line antibiotics. They employed logistic regression, decision trees,\nand random forest models to develop a decision algorithm for outpatient antimicrobial stewardship in uncomplicated\nUTIS.\nWith the growing data collected, machine-learning techniques have shown great potential in improving prescription\npractices and reducing antibiotic resistance in antimicrobial stewardship."}, {"title": "AMR Driver Quantification", "content": "Understanding the drivers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in a specific population or system is significant in com-\nbating its spread and mitigating its impact on public health.

Studies such as\n[4, 15] investigate the One Health framework, quantifying the relative impacts of human, animal, and environmental\nuse and transmission of antibiotics. Allel et al.

In 2017, Wright et al. [99] provide a prior insight into antibiotics exploration status, highlighting\npotential solutions such as antibiotic adjuvants, alternatives of antibiotics such as antivirulence compounds and biofilm\ninhibitors, and techniques of synthetic biology. Until 2020, Stokes et al. [87] advanced antibiotic discovery by fully\nleveraging AI for the first time, representing a notable step forward in the field. Their directed-message passing graph\nneural network model, trained on diverse molecular datasets, exhibits promising results in predicting antibiotics based\non molecular structures, with one candidate demonstrating broad-spectrum antibiotic activities. Then, Das et al. [27]\npush the frontier with accelerated antimicrobial discovery frameworks, merging attribute-controlled deep generative\nmodels and molecular dynamics simulations to expedite the identification of antimicrobial candidates. Li et al. [49]\nharness the power of attention mechanisms in AMPlify, a deep learning model tailored for the discovery of antimicro-\nbial peptides effective against WHO-priority pathogens. Furthermore, Ma et al. [57] delve into metagenomic data to\nuncover antimicrobial peptides within the human gut microbiome, employing a series of natural language processing\nneural network models. More Recently, Wong et al. [98] innovatively introduced an explainable graph neural network\nto discover new structural classes of antibiotics by leveraging large chemical libraries.\nMeanwhile, with the advances in methods, particularly the integration of deep learning networks, the diversity and\ncomplexity of data available in this field have expanded significantly. This encompasses a wide range of molecular\nstructures, including those from drug libraries, natural products, various antibiotics, and other compounds [87, 98], as\nwell as antimicrobial peptides [27, 49] and metagenomic data [57].\nIn sum, the feature of employed data analytical methods varies across different AMR tasks, ranging from traditional\nstatistical analysis to deep neural networks. AMR surveillance mainly focuses on data collection and extracting gen-\neral descriptional information from data, and therefore, works in this task mainly utilize basic statistical methods, for\nexample, basic statistics (e.g., data distribution and average), and statistical tests (e.g., t-test). AMR driver quantifica-\ntion and antimicrobial stewardship extract more information from AMR-related data, and therefore, they involve more\nadvanced methods, like machine learning. Among the aforementioned AMR tasks, AMR prediction and novel antimi-\ncrobial discovery, especially when tackling genetic data, employ the most complex data analytical models, including\nadvanced deep learning models."}, {"title": "AMR Data Sources, Collection, and Challenges", "content": "The previous section mentioned specific examples of datasets used in AMR tasks. Here, we provide a broader overview\nof the overall landscape of data in this field. Data used in AMR research are commonly sourced from diverse origins.\nGiven the varied focuses across different research domains of AMR, a range of data types are employed, as illustrated\nbelow.\n\u2022 AMR prediction. Genomic data plays a key role in identifying and predicting antimicrobial resistance genes\n(ARGs) [7, 64, 80]. Given the time-consuming and low-throughput nature of traditional antimicrobial sus-\nceptibility testing (AST), which applies only to cultivable bacteria, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has\nbecome a routine method for ARG profiling. This involves comparing genomic sequences with databases\nof known ARGs, such as CARD, ResFinder, and UniProt. These databases are manually curated, provid-\ning molecular sequence references for predicting AMR genotypes from genomic data. To enhance ARG\nprofiles, databases from different sources are often integrated [23, 7]. Many studies demonstrate the poten-\ntial of machine learning methods for predicting AMR by combining sequencing approaches, well-known\ndatabases, and phenotypic information [80]. Additionally, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of\nflight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, commonly used for microbial species identification, has also been\napplied to AMR prediction [96].\n\u2022 Antimicrobial stewardship. As discussed, the primary goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to optimise an-\ntimicrobial use and aid in the selection of suitable treatment regimens [28]. Traditionally, clinicians have\nrelied on patient clinical data as their main decision-making source. Despite the existence of computerised\ndecision systems like TREAT for antibiotic treatment [48], their adoption has been limited due to their spe-\ncialised nature [5]. The emergence of electronic health records (EHRs) enables the integration of data-driven\napproaches to enhance clinician decisions. For instance, Kanjilal et al. [43] employ machine learning on EHR\ndata to predict antibiotic susceptibility and develop a decision algorithm recommending the narrowest possi-\nble antibiotic to which a specimen is susceptible. EHRs include patient-relevant data, such as demographics,\nclinical information, pharmacy records, and laboratory results."}, {"title": "AMR Data Collection and Surveillance", "content": "AMR-related data are collected through routine, periodic, or sporadic activities, similar to other data collection prac-\ntices. Routine data collection activities, exemplified by medical records, are conducted on a regular, continuous basis\nat service delivery points such as health facilities, pharmacies, or laboratories. Conversely, non-routine activities such\nas surveys and interviews are conducted periodically or as one-time efforts to answer specific questions. While sur-\nveys may be costly and difficult to repeat, they often yield higher-quality data that are more representative of the target\npopulation due to their focused nature.\nAn example of routine data collection is surveillance, which the World Health Organization (WHO) defines as \"the\ncontinuous, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data needed for action\"14. AMR\nsurveillance aims to detect and monitor changes and trends in microbial populations, including drug-resistant organ-\nisms and resistance determinants like genes and mechanisms15. Effective AMR surveillance systems should capture\npatients' demographic and clinical profiles while integrating with other monitoring platforms, such as those tracking\nantimicrobial consumption (AMC) and the quality and supply chains of antimicrobial drugs. For instance, the Global\nAntimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) [70, 2], established by WHO through the May 2015\nWorld Health Assembly action plan on antimicrobial resistance[68], provides a standardized framework for collecting,\nanalyzing, and sharing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) data from participating countries. GLASS collaborates with\nnational and regional AMR surveillance networks, such as the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health\nCare 16.\nAs part of a One Health approach, human AMR surveillance data should be combined with data from animal, agricul-\ntural, and environmental sectors to provide a holistic view of AMR [30, 71]. However, AMR data collection in humans\nremains more comprehensive and systematic than in other sectors (e.g., animals, plants, and the environment) due to\nthe presence of well-established health facilities in many parts of the world. To facilitate systematic collection and\nanalysis, international and national health organisations, such as WHO, have published standard AMR surveillance\nmanuals. These manuals guide healthcare and medical practitioners in collecting and analysing data at various levels,\nsuch as hospital and community levels. They also standardise key elements, including the categorization of microbes\nand antimicrobials, antimicrobial consumption doses, and methodologies for data collection, such as reporting fre-\nquency and contextual details about hospitals and patients. Under these guidelines, organisations regularly report on\ninternational and national human AMR status, as exemplified in publications like [34, 71], based on indicators derived\nfrom standardised data.\nBeyond humans, AMR-related data are also collected in other sectors. Examples include studies on antimicrobial us-\nage in domesticated animals [37], antibiotic-resistant lineages in Australian silver gulls [100], AMR features such as\nantibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) in water sources (e.g., wastew-\nater, recycled water, or surface water) [51, 95, 13], ARG types and concentrations in manure and soil from swine\nfarms [109], and antibiotic usage in water and soil [107].\nHowever, compared to AMR data collection in humans, data collection in these sectors is less systematic, often\nfragmented, and hindered by challenges such as the lack of organised monitoring systems and reliance on individual\nresearch teams. Realising the importance of the more comprehensive One Health approach, national and international\norganizations have started advancing AMR surveillance across sectors. For instance, WHO published a manual for One\nHealth surveillance to monitor an indicator\u2014the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia\ncoli-across human, animal, and environmental sectors [69]."}, {"title": "Challenges with Data Collection and Use", "content": "The collection and use of AMR data present many challenges. Firstly, a significant challenge lies in the unavail-\nability of data, particularly pronounced in regions such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where robust\nsurveillance systems for AMR are lacking. This absence leads to significant gaps in understanding the true extent\nof antimicrobial resistance. Factors such as weak laboratory capacities, inadequate governance of health systems,\ndeficient health information systems, and limited resources contribute to the challenges faced by LMICs in establish-\ning effective surveillance mechanisms [38]. Even when data are available, they often suffer from limited coverage\nand lack crucial details. In a study on global trends of hospital-associated infections due to hospital-acquired resis-\ntant infections (HARI) [9], despite covering over 90% of the global population, findings were reported from only 99\ncountries, and the data reported may not be nationally representative or instead biased towards larger tertiary care\nhospitals. Moreover, only 11 low-income countries report hospital-based point prevalence surveys, often based on\nsmall samples. Even if data is available in a particular location, reports on hospitalisation rates and resistance for\nindividual drug-pathogen combinations are scarce, thus introducing uncertainties when extrapolating country-level\ninfection rates and resistance prevalence from the hospital-level data. Similar challenges are faced by other global or\nregional studies on AMR [24, 60].\nAdditionally, data from different sources often exhibit heterogeneity in terms of structure, format, and content. Data\nmight be structured (e.g., EHRs), unstructured (e.g., surveillance reports), or fall in between. Even within structured\ndata, there are variations in data representations. For example, diagnoses may be captured in unstructured clinical\nnotes, or structured data such as Internation Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, while laboratory results may be\nlabelled with specific or nonspecific Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) codes [10]. Addi-\ntionally, there are divergences in data collection methods, diagnostic criteria, and reporting practices, contributing to\nchallenges in data use and undermining the reliability of analysis results.\nFurthermore, data integrity is frequently compromised by various quality issues Errors introduced during data entry or\nintegration pose significant concerns. For instance, manually curated gene databases often contain inaccuracies such\nas sequence annotation typos and classification errors, which propagate when integrating data from multiple sources\nwithout validation ([23, 7]). Nonrandom missing values in the data can skew results and impact the generalisability of\nfindings ([74]). Insufficient metadata accompanying the data complicates interpretation and use, as critical contextual\ninformation may be absent. Conflicting facts from disparate sources may lead to inconsistencies when integrating data,\nundermining the reliability of analytical outcomes. Finally, redundancies or duplicates or imbalanced distributions in\nthe data can introduce noise and bias if not addressed."}, {"title": "Mitigating Data Challenges in ML-based AMR Research", "content": "As we observed in Section 2, AMR research is increasingly adopting machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)\nmethods to tackle complex tasks. However, these methods come with inherent data challenges, many of which were\noutlined in Section 3.2. For example, heterogeneity in data formats and collection methods can often lead to noise.\nSimilarly, integrity issues like missing metadata, incomplete datasets, and skewed data collection practices can con-\ntribute to bias, such as representation bias or measurement bias. These challenges, while specific to AMR contexts,\nalso align with general ML workflows. Figure 3 shows the mitigation process for data challenges, primarily including\ndata noise and bias, spans various phases of the general ML workflow, particularly during data handling and model\ndevelopment phases.\nFor the main AMR tasks, the initial step typically involves data collection, a process sensitive to various forms of noise\nand bias. Data noise refers to irrelevant or erroneous data that can obscure the underlying patterns and relationships\nwithin the dataset, while data bias pertains to systematic errors or inaccuracies that skew the dataset towards certain\noutcomes or perspectives. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of subsequent\nanalyses. In this section, we delve into strategies for mitigating data noise and bias in AMR research, exploring both\nthe phases of data preparation, modelling and evaluation."}, {"title": "Mitigation Process in Data Collection and Preparation", "content": "Among the data quality issues listed in Section 1, several, namely data noise, social bias, measurement bias, represen-\ntation bias, and label bias, can be mitigated during the data collection and preparation process. Aligning with balanced\nand consistent principles in the data collection process is one of the most efficient ways to obtain low noise and unbi-\nased data analytical results. However, defining proper principles for each situation and ensuring each data collection\nsite complies with the predefined principles are challenging, especially for large-scale data collection schemes. We\ntake the principles of WHO's GLASS [70] for AMR surveillance, a major systematic AMR data collection approach,\nas an example to demonstrate the mitigation for the above data quality issues.\nOrganization [70] provide principles for nation-level members of the GLASS surveillance system, suggesting that each\ncountry gradually improves their data collection processing to achieve data denoise and debias goals by the following\npoints.\n1. Clearly define the AMR surveillance objectives so that the surveillance system can set up efficient data col-\nlection plans. For instance, with a clear surveillance target, e.g., to assess human-centred or one health level\nAMR and to monitor hospital-level or wider health care facility level AMR, the surveillance system is able\nto build a comprehensive data collection roadmap to achieve the corresponding goals.\n2. Include comprehensive populations in the surveillance system and set up a sufficient representation sampling\nsize for each population to ensure the data sampling is geographically and demographically balanced. Within\neach population, healthcare facilities of the target level should be gradually added to the surveillance system\nto ensure a balanced data sampling scheme.\n3. Probability sampling methods can be used as guidance to design the surveillance system to ensure sufficient\nrandomness and balance in data collection.\n4. Regularly train surveillance sites for systematically identifying patients with suspected infection, present-\ning results of consistent departments and wards, and conducting consistent and rigorous laboratory testings.\nWhen clinical quality-assured laboratories are absent, set quality-assured laboratories in strategic geoloca-\ntions to maximize diagnostic coverage of healthcare facilities and deploy rapid sample referral from surveil-\nlance sites. Promote routine communication between relevant teams, e.g., clinicians, laboratory personnel,\nthe infection prevention and control team, and epidemiologists.\nPotentially, approaches (1), (2), and (3) aim at mitigating social bias, measurement bias, representation bias, and label\nbias. (4) mainly aims at reducing data noise while also mitigating measurement bias and label bias. However, it is\nchallenging to guarantee the principles at all sites nationwide, especially in developing and remote areas, and GLASS\nsuggests gradually improving the surveillance system.\nData denoising is often used in the data preparation phase. Data denoising aims to remove or minimize noise from the\ndataset, thereby enhancing its quality and utility for subsequent analysis. The related studies mainly adopt strategies\nsuch as data validation, cleaning, and sanitization processes [97]. For instance, Arango-Argoty et al. [7] addresses"}, {"title": "Mitigation Strategies in Modeling", "content": "In the preceding discussion, we primarily explored the collection, utilization, and analytical methods employed in\nAMR research across four core tasks: prediction, stewardship, antimicrobial discovery, and driver quantification.\nAn observation worth noting is the growing preference among researchers for machine learning (ML) and deep learn-\ning methods over traditional statistical approaches. For example, in the context of the AMR prediction task, this shift\nis underscored by several compelling reasons:\n1. Complexity of Biological Data: AMR involves intricate genetic variations and interactions among bacteria.\nMachine learning excels at capturing complex patterns within genomic data. The depth and adaptability\nof these models make them well-suited for identifying subtle genetic variations associated with antibiotic\nresistance genes (ARGs) [7].\n2. Improved Predictive Accuracy: Machine learning and deep learning models [64, 96, 80] have demonstrated\nsuperior predictive accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods. These models can handle the non-\nlinear relationships inherent in genetic and clinical data, resulting in more accurate predictions.\n3. Adaptability to Diverse Data Types: The shift towards machine learning corresponds with the incorporation\nof diverse data types beyond genomic data. For instance, mass spectra data from clinical isolates [96] and\nknowledge graphs [105] contribute additional perspectives to the predictive models. Machine learning tech-\nniques can seamlessly integrate and analyze these multiple data dimensions, providing a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of AMR.\n4. Accelerated Predictions and Practical Applicability: Machine learning models [64, 96] have demonstrated\ngood performance for accelerating the prediction process. This is particularly important in healthcare settings\nwhere timely and accurate predictions of antimicrobial resistance can influence treatment decisions.\n5. Flexibility and Generalization: Machine learning models, being data-driven and flexible, can generalize\nwell to new data. In contrast, traditional statistical methods may struggle to adapt to the complexities of\nevolving resistance patterns or new genetic information.\nRobustness improvement in the modelling phase is crucial for developing machine learning models that can effectively\nhandle noisy data and produce reliable predictions. Some methodologies include data imputation techniques employed\nby [60, 8] to enhance the robustness of predictive models. Additionally, Ma et al. [57] enhances model robustness\nby combining outputs from multiple natural language processing models, thereby increasing the model's resilience to\nnoisy input data. Furthermore, recent advancements in ML-based AMR research, particularly relating to deep learning\napproaches, have shown promise in improving model robustness and generalization capabilities, as presented by the\nlatest bias-variance trade-off discussion [12, 103]."}, {"title": "Data Bias and Fair Modeling", "content": "In the context of machine learning (ML) projects, biases can manifest at various stages, impacting the reliability\nand fairness of model outcomes. Van Giffen et al. [91] summarizes eight types of biases prevalent in ML projects,\nincluding social bias, representation bias, measurement bias, label bias, algorithmic bias, deployment bias, evaluation\nbias, and feedback bias. Social bias occurs when available data reflects existing biases in the relevant population\nprior to the creation of the ML model. Representation bias arises when the input data fails to adequately represent\nthe relevant population. Measurement bias occurs when chosen features and labels are imperfect proxies for the true\nvariables of interest. Label bias occurs when labelled data systematically deviates from the underlying truth categories.\nAlgorithmic bias results from inappropriate technical considerations during modelling, leading to systemic deviations\nin outcomes. Deployment bias occurs when the ML model is used and interpreted in a different context than it was\nbuilt for. Evaluation bias arises from the use of nonrepresentative testing populations or inappropriate performance\nmetrics."}, {"title": "Improving Fairness in Other Medical Domains", "content": "Transitioning from the discussion on bias mitigation in AMR research, we delve into the broader landscape of fairness\nimprovement methods in other medical domains.\nHealthcare often has disparities linked to societal biases such as geographic and financial issues and racial biases.\nWhen AI models are trained on unrepresentative databases or use improper proxies, it could lead to the unintentional\namplification of existing biases, potentially resulting in systematic discrimination against specific groups, like racial\ndiscrimination. [66] discussed a widely used commercial prediction algorithm that exhibited racial bias, primarily\nattributed to inappropriate proxy (measurement bias) related to healthcare expenses rather than actual illness indica-\ntors, then reformulate the algorithm with proper proxy measurement to accurately identify and predict patients who\nneed extra care. [76] applied adversarial learning techniques to electronic health records, aiming to construct an in-\nclusive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk prediction model. This model was specifically designed\nto ensure fairness across various gender and race groups, contributing to a more comprehensive and fair approach to\nhealthcare analysis. [78] presented a strategy to address bias concerns by fostering collaboration among local health-\ncare institutions through a federated learning paradigm. They encouraged a fair federated learning model with sensitive\ninformation-free representation by incorporating adversarial debiasing and a fair aggregation method that is adaptable\nto diverse fairness metrics, particularly in the healthcare domain where electronic health records are employed.\nFor the specific discussion of biases, [32] lists three main biases in machine learning algorithms using electronic health\nrecord data for diagnosis and treatment: (1) missing or incomplete data of certain patient populations which results in\ninaccurate predictions for these populations; (2) insufficient sample sizes which make data unrepresentative and lead to\nunderestimation for certain patient populations; (3) misclassification or measurement errors which may be introduced\nby practitioners and make algorithms inaccurately learn and embed practitioner biases. There are a series of 3 papers\naddressing mitigating bias in radiology machine learning from 3 phrases: data handling [83], model development\n[106], and performance metrics [29].

The Shapley values\n[85] are calculated to help interpret the machine learning models.\nCavallaro et al.

The work uses a gradient-boosted\ndecision tree to predict the presence of AMR in a clinical setting based on a variety of patient data. Again, Shapely\nvalues are used to address the model's potential underlying dependence. The study finds that historical antibiotic pre-\nscriptions play an important role in resistance prediction. It has shown that the prescription of any antibiotic is likely\nto result in AMR. Explanations of prediction models either support existing hypotheses or contradict them. The latter\nmay help identify the problem in the data.\nThe increasing use of Shapley values as a mechanism to explain AMR prediction models faces its own challenge. As\nindicated by [59], Shapley values can provide misleading explanations of feature importance.\nInterpretability methods are also used in antibiotic discovery. Wong et al.

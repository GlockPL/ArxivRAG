South Asian countries are working to improve their primary healthcare system through their country specific policies designed in line with WHO health system framework using the six thematic pillars: Health Financing, Health Service delivery, Human Resource for Health, Health Information Systems, Governance, Essential Medicines and Technology, and an addition area of Cross-Sectoral Linkages [11]. Measuring the current accessibility of healthcare facilities and workforce availability is essential for improving healthcare standards and achieving universal health coverage in developing countries. Data-driven surveillance approaches are required that can provide rapid, reliable, and geographically scalable solutions to understand a) which communities and areas are most at risk of inequitable access and when, b) what barriers to health access exist, and c) how they can be overcome in ways tailored to the specific challenges faced by individual communities. We propose to harness current breakthroughs in Earth-observation (EO) technology, which provide the ability to generate accurate, up-to-date, publicly accessible, and reliable data, which is necessary for equitable access planning and resource allocation to ensure that vaccines, and other interventions reach everyone, particularly those in greatest need, during normal and crisis times. This requires collaboration among countries to identify evidence based solutions to shape health policy and interventions, and drive innovations and research in the region.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Even while the Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) is being achieved, 381 million people, or 4.9% of the world's population, still live in severe poverty and do not have access to even the most basic healthcare [29,23]. Mortality rates are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, essentially due to insufficient access to primary healthcare services [29]. It is incumbent to address discrepancies in order to close this gap and guarantee equitable access to healthcare. To achieve the vision of \"Health for All\u201d, we must address the systemic barriers that perpetuate health inequities [20,4]. Inequity has many dimensions [24] as shown in figure 1; barriers include and are not limited to: a) lack of access to infrastructure, e.g., health facilities [25]; b) access to communication infrastructure in remote locations, e.g., poor road networks and communication links [28]; and c) affordability and intersectional determinants of access, such as gender, age, and lifestyle factors [21].\nInsufficient and ineffective healthcare methods exacerbate the lack of appropriate access to health-care [9], and many low- and middle-income nations lack real-world health data infrastructure due to overworked healthcare systems. In heavily populated areas, particularly urban slums and remote rural areas. Manual monitoring and data gathering in remote locations can be unacceptably time-consuming, costly, prone to human error and malpractice and unsustainable given limited resources [13].\nData-driven surveillance approaches are required that can provide rapid, reliable, and geographically scalable solutions to understand: a) which communities and areas are most at risk of inequitable access and when [10]; b) what barriers to health access exist; and c) how these barriers can be overcome in ways tailored to the specific challenges faced by individual communities [16]. It can help to reduce health data poverty and disparities. Better knowledge, achieved through better data and robust decision-support systems, can help address everyone's health requirements in an equitable manner [6].\nThe goal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Data Modernization Initiative (DMI) is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of health data collecting, sharing, and analysis.\nOn the other hand, there isn't much research on integrating social determinants of health (SDOH) into state and federal DMI initiatives. The terms SDOH refer to an individual's living, learning, and working environments, as well as the ways in which these environments impact their health. Examples of SDOH include safe housing, access to wholesome food, employment possibilities, and transportation.\nWe propose to harness current breakthroughs in Earth-observation (EO) technology, which provides the ability to generate accurate, up-to-date, publicly accessible, and reliable data, which is required for equitable access planning and resource allocation to ensure that safe medicines, vaccines, and other interventions reach everyone, particularly those in greatest need, during normal times [27,7]. This data can also be used in emergency scenarios such as pandemics and natural catastrophes, which disproportionately affect underserved groups [17]. Therefore, this data creation can help identify requirements and track progress towards increasing equal access to healthcare worldwide. This is particularly important in resource-constrained areas, both in normal and emergency situations [2]. Figure. 1 illustrates how government-level policies can address health inequalities, a key focus of SDG 3 [29,23]. It emphasizes the role of parents' socioeconomic resources in influencing children's health, which in turn influences the health of the young and old, as well as education and income levels. Our approach can identify health gaps in peripheral areas and improve surveillance, especially in resource-limited areas. By harnessing the power of EO and artificial intelligence, we can create a fairer and more sustainable healthcare system that leaves no one behind.\nOur major contributions to mapping health equities in South Asia, as compared to AccessMod 5 (see Appendix A), include the following:\nRemote areas and potential improvement neighborhoods with missing nighttime light intensity: We use nighttime light intensity data to find unmet needs in the most remote areas. With this method we can also identify geographical areas with poorly served health services in terms of infrastructure development\nLocalizing health disparities in underserved remote areas: We focus on pinpointing specific health disparities within the identified under-served areas. This localization helps to understand the specific health needs and challenges faced by these communities, allowing for targeted interventions."}, {"title": "2 Mapping Primary Health Care Infrastructure Gaps", "content": "Strategists, academics, and public health practitioners strive to improve the overall health of the population by addressing health disparities based on geographic origin, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and other social factors. Health inequalities refer to systematic variations in health status among various socioeconomic classes in a society, which are socially produced, theoretically avoidable, and often considered undesirable in a civilized society [33]. The concept of health inequality makes no moral judgments about whether observed disparities are equitable or right. A health inequity, also known as a health disparity, is a subtype of health inequality that refers to an unjust discrepancy in health status. Allowing health inequalities to persist is unjust, according to one common definition [32]. In this sense, health inequities are systematic differences in health that could be avoided by reasonable means [16]. Social group differences in health, such as those based on race or religion, are considered health inequities because they reflect an unfair distribution of health risks and resources. The key distinction between inequality and inequity is that the former is simply a dimensional description employed whenever quantities are unequal, while the latter requires passing a moral judgment that the inequality is wrong. For example, the term \"health inequality\" can reflect racial/ethnic differences in US infant mortality rates, which are roughly three times greater for non-Hispanic blacks than whites [22].\nAge-related health disparities, such as those between the ages of 20 and 60, are seen as health inequalities and are perceived as unavoidable rather than unjust. By contrast, disparities in health are investigated among populations worldwide according to factors such as income, caste, gender, education, race/ethnicity, and employment. To investigate these disparities, researchers compare socioeconomic variables and examine variations in health outcomes at the group level. For example, comparing the mean body mass index (BMI) of the wealthy to that of the impoverished can help explain socioeconomic differences. In order to reduce disparities brought about by the unequal distribution of social determinants of health, policy development and resource allocation must acknowledge and address social group health inequalities [1]. The World Health Organization proposes that health indicators be reported by groups, or equity stratifiers, in order to monitor health disparities. By concentrating on social groupings, we may comprehend present health inequalities within a historical and cultural framework and subsequently offer an explanation of the mechanisms underlying health inequality [19]. For instance, knowledge of American racism and slavery past can help explain current racial/ethnic health disparities. Similarly, studying the political and theological history of India's caste system allows us to better appreciate how it influences people's social position, employment, education levels, and health outcomes. Viewing health inequalities through the lens of social groups can help direct actions, enable surveillance of key equity concerns, and increase our knowledge of health by making connections that were not initially clear. Health inequalities along racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines exist in both low- and high-income nations, and they may be expanding, emphasizing the necessity of investigating group-level health discrepancies [3]. Understanding socially patterned health inequalities requires defining meaningful social groups. Each community has its own distinct method of classifying and separating people into social divisions.\nThe second related topic is whether absolute or relative position matters for health. This is especially relevant when it comes to poverty, which can be defined in two ways: absolute (comparing a given income to a static benchmark) and relative (comparing a given income to the general distribution of incomes in a community). Absolute poverty definitions are based on a set monetary barrier known as a poverty line, though this barrier is normally determined by the year, nation, and household size. Those with incomes less than the criteria are deemed destitute. In contrast, relative poverty is defined by comparing a particular income to the income distribution in a population. For example, one could argue that a person is comparatively impoverished if their income is less than thirty percent of the national per capital income [1]. This suggests that the concept of poverty is not static and may change over time. Wealth, income, and education are a few factors that contribute to an individual's socioeconomic position (SEP). Education can be defined as the highest level attained or the total number of years spent in school. The main factor affecting the material resources component of SEP is income, which"}, {"title": "3 Proposed Approach", "content": "The study utilizes three following primary open-source datasets (see Fig. 3) to identify global regions where new healthcare facilities are most needed:\nAccessibility to Healthcare 2019\nThe Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11\nVIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Annual Band Composites V2.2"}, {"title": "3.1 Open source datasets", "content": "The study utilizes three following primary open-source datasets (see Fig. 3) to identify global regions where new healthcare facilities are most needed:\nAccessibility to Healthcare 2019\nThe Gridded Population of World Version 4 (GPWv4), Revision 11\nVIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Annual Band Composites V2.2"}, {"title": "3.2 Finding Health Disparities", "content": "The proposed methodology for finding health disparities as shown in figure 2 and algorithm 1 involve following steps:\nImporting Datasets: The analysis environment receives the datasets for accessibility, population density, and nighttime light intensity.\nFiltering Areas with Limited Accessibility: Locations where traveling to the nearest medical facility takes more than thirty minutes are marked.

In highly populated locations with limited access to healthcare, the need score is greater (See Fig. 4 (a) & (b)).\nAggregating Need Over a Region: A regional need score is produced by adding up the requirements within a 25-kilometer radius. Rather than focusing only on individual pixels, this aggregation aids in identifying larger areas of need (See Fig. 4 (c)).\nIdentifying High-Need Regions: By calculating the 99th percentile of the regional need ratings, the areas with the largest requirements are found.

Our research identifies areas where healthcare facilities are most urgently required by combining data on travel time to medical facilities, population density, and nighttime light intensity. The findings underline the need of addressing health inequities, particularly in densely populated areas with limited access to healthcare. We identify the 1% of regions with the most health services by combining the needs scores calculation with the larger regions. This method ensures that treatments are directed where they are most needed, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources. The production of accurate, up-to-date and publicly available information has been facilitated by advanced technologies such as data science and Earth observation.

India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are among the world's most populous nations. According to UN estimates, the population of the region will reach astonishing numbers by 2050 if the current growth rate is allowed to continue unchecked. Numerous factors, such as high birth rates, limited access to family planning services, cultural norms, and religious beliefs, are blamed for this growth. It is necessary to take proactive measures to lower the overall fertility rate and raise the prevalence of contraception in order to combat population growth. Primary healthcare systems must be strengthened in light of demographic changes. This development is hampered, nevertheless, by low funding, inadequate planning, and a lack of knowledge about the role that primary healthcare plays in population health.\nInequitable Access and Urban-Rural Disparities: In South Asian countries, there are notable geographic differences in the coverage of provinces, districts, and urban-rural areas.

Through cooperation and shared commitment, South Asia can achieve a more robust and equitable healthcare system for all of its citizens. By implementing these coordinated actions, South Asian countries can significantly strengthen their healthcare ecosystems.\n\u2022 Data-Driven Approach\nEstablish Regional Health Data Repositories: Construct a single, easily accessible repository for health data that can be used by all of South Asia's nations to gather, store, and process health data. Data on the prevalence of diseases, healthcare resources, patient outcomes, and other pertinent metrics ought to be included in this repository.\nImplement Standardized Health Information Systems: To guarantee data consistency and interoperability, adopt standardized health information systems throughout the region. This will make it easier for health data from different nations to be shared and compared.\nUtilize Advanced Analytics: Employ advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to identify trends, predict outbreaks, and optimize resource allocation. This will enable a proactive rather than reactive approach to healthcare management.\n\u2022 Align Policymakers and Local Bodies\nRegular Inter-Governmental Health Summits: Arrange for policymakers from South Asian nations to convene on a regular basis to tackle shared healthcare issues, exchange optimal methodologies, and harmonize on regional health policies.\nCollaborative Policy Frameworks: Develop and implement collaborative policy frameworks that address cross-border health issues such as infectious disease control, healthcare financing, and workforce development.\nEngage Local Authorities: Make sure local organizations actively participate in the creation and execution of policies, taking into account their particular perspectives and practical experience.\n\u2022 Sharing Resources and Transferability\nResource Sharing Agreements: Create official contracts for the sharing of essential health-care resources like drugs, medical supplies, and knowledge. This will facilitate access to necessary services and assist in addressing shortages.\nCross-Border Healthcare Training Programs: Implement cross-border training programs for healthcare professionals to build capacity and ensure the transferability of skills and knowledge across the region.\nTelemedicine and Remote Consultation Services: Increase the availability of telemedicine services to facilitate the sharing of resources and offer online consultations, particularly in underprivileged areas.\n\u2022 Coordination Among Regions\nRegional Health Coordination Bodies: Set up regional health coordination bodies to facilitate cooperation and coordination among South Asian countries. These bodies can oversee joint initiatives, monitor progress, and address emerging health challenges.\nJoint Research and Development Initiatives: Encourage collaborative R&D projects centered around non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, and technological advancements in healthcare.\nEmergency Response Coordination: To effectively manage health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies, develop a coordinated emergency response framework.\n\u2022 Rapid Action Teams\nEstablish Regional Rapid Response Teams: Form multidisciplinary rapid response teams that can be deployed quickly to any South Asian country facing a health crisis. These teams should include medical professionals, epidemiologists, logistics experts, and communication specialists.\nRegular Drills and Simulations:Hold frequent drills and simulations to make sure rapid response teams are capable of cross-border operations and are ready for a variety of scenarios.\nReal-Time Communication Channels: Set up real-time communication channels for rapid action teams to coordinate efforts, share information, and mobilize resources swiftly.\n\u2022 Data Scientists Team\nRegional Data Science Consortium: Create a consortium of data scientists from South Asian countries to collaborate on health data analysis, predictive modeling, and decision support systems.\nTraining and Capacity Building: Fund educational initiatives to create a strong pool of data scientists with backgrounds in epidemiology and health informatics.\nData-Driven Decision Support Tools: Create and implement tools for decision-making that use data analytics to guide the allocation of resources, clinical procedures, and policy decisions"}]}

Con-sidering that RDF specifications offer limited support for effectively man-aging spatial information, it's common practice to include text-based se-rializations of geometrical features, such as polygons and lines, as stringliterals in knowledge graphs. Consequently, Spatial Knowledge Graphs(SKGs) often rely on geo-enabled RDF Stores capable of parsing, in-terpreting, and indexing such serializations. In this paper, we leveragegrid cells as the foundational element of SKGs and demonstrate howefficiently the spatial characteristics of real-world entities and their at-tributes can be encoded within knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we intro-duce a novel methodology for representing street networks in knowledgegraphs, diverging from the conventional practice of individually captur-ing each street segment. Instead, our approach is based on tessellatingthe street network using grid cells and creating a simplified represen-tation that could be utilized for various routing and navigation tasks,solely relying on RDF specifications.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Integrating geospatial data into knowledge graphs enriches the representationof real-world entities and fosters deeper insights into their spatial relationships.The resulting knowledge graphs, known as Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG),are particularly useful in domains such as crisis management and urban plan-ning, facilitating tasks such as proximity searches, resource planning, or spatialreasoning. Furthermore, SKGs enhance the understanding of relationships be-tween entities, leveraging their geographic proximity or spatial interactions. Theprocess of constructing SKGs from isolated spatial entities, such as landmarks,regions, points of interest, and observations, typically entails integrating theirgeometry serializations (i.e., as points or polygons) as well as their spatial rela-tionships with other entities."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "We utilize a grid cell system to organize spatial features and their relation-ships.

In this context, every grid cell includes designated row andcolumn orders, along with the precise coordinates of its center. The row and col-umn orders facilitate the process of querying grid cells within a specified rangeand simplify the retrieval of relevant grid cells. Additionally, each grid cell isassociated with a polygon geometry used for visualization purposes."}, {"title": "2.1 Grid Cell Orientation", "content": "We define the orientation of grid cells as a quantitative indicator representing theefficiency of traffic flow within them. This indicator relies on various propertiesof the underlying street network, including the direction and number of roads indifferent orientations. This orientation indicator of cell C in different directionsis calculated based on the overlapping street segments Si with cell C as follows:\n$O_{d}(C)=\\begin{cases}\\frac{\\sum_{S \\in C} L_{S} * cos(B_{S}) * W_{S}}{\\sum_{S \\in C}L_{S}}, d= East \\text{ or } West\\\\\\frac{\\sum_{S \\in C} L_{S} * sin(B_{S}) * W_{S}}{\\sum_{S \\in C}L_{S}}, d= North \\text{ or } South\\end{cases}$ (1)\nWhere $L_{s}, B_{s}, W_{s}$ are length, bearing angle, and number of street lanesfor each street segment, respectively and all these values are readily availablein Open Street Map data. The orientation of a street network plays a pivotalrole in shaping traffic flow within a city or urban area.

It has demonstrated the potential to meet the spatial application require-ments across diverse use cases, including crisis management. Furthermore, gridcells offer numerous advantages for capturing spatial entities and scaling quanti-tative indicators. Despite the time-consuming nature of constructing simplifiedstreet networks for grid cells, it's a one-time computation. Once generated, thenetwork and calculated cell properties remain largely unchanged, enabling long-term usage for routing and navigation applications.\nAnother topic requiring further exploration is the choice of grid cell shapeand size. As previously mentioned, we utilize square-kilometer grid cells in oursolution. This decision was driven by the availability of national weather dataat this granularity level. However, we've found that this grid size is also bene-ficial for other crisis management applications, such as capturing infrastructurenetworks and spatial entities. Nevertheless, the proposed SKG has the capa-bility to support multiple grid cell sizes simultaneously. For example, we couldincorporate larger grid cells, such as 100 square kilometers, built on top of thesmaller grid cells. These larger cells may also support upscaling and downscalingoperations, as discussed in this research. Regarding the shape of the grid cells,"}, {"title": "5 Related Work", "content": "One of the earliest efforts to integrate geospatial information into RDF is theW3C Basic Geo Vocabulary [13]. It offers the Semantic Web community a names-pace for representing spatial features represented by points, with WGS84 servingas the reference datum. This was later followed by GeoRDF proposal, aiming tooffer an RDF-compatible profile for describing geometric information, includingpoints, lines, and polygons. Over the past decade, the Semantic Web Communityhas continued this line and joined forces with the Open Geospatial Consortium(OGC) to make spatial data more effectively available and address requirements"}]}

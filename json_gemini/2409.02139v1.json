INTRODUCTION", "content": "N the digital age, blockchain technology [1] has emerged\nas one of the most revolutionary technologies [2], em-\npowering various industries such as finance [3, 4], supply\nchain [5, 6, 10], and healthcare [7-9, 11] with its unique\ndecentralized nature, immutability, and transparency. Since the\nadvent of Bitcoin, various types of cryptocurrencies and smart\ncontract platforms like Ethereum have demonstrated the ex-\ntensive value of blockchain technology [12-14]. However,\nwith increasingly complex application scenarios and growing\ndemands, blockchain technology faces numerous challenges,\nincluding transaction efficiency, data processing capabilities,\nand security issues [15-18].\nMeanwhile, since its introduction [19] in 2017, the Trans-\nformer model has achieved groundbreaking progress in the\nfield of natural language processing (NLP) [20\u201322].As shown\nin Figure 1, research literature on transformers has signifi-\ncantly increased in recent years. This model, based on the self-\nattention mechanism, effectively handles long-range depen-\ndencies and, due to its efficient parallel computing capabilities,\nhas been widely applied to complex sequential data tasks.\nIts unique structure has shown remarkable abilities in image\nrecognition [23], speech processing [24], and multimodal\nlearning [25]. Given the sequential nature of blockchain data\nand the complex interrelations between transaction data [26],\napplying Transformers to the blockchain domain, particularly\nin processing on-chain data, anomaly detection, and optimiz-\ning smart contracts, holds significant potential [27\u201330].\nFor example, in transaction monitoring and anomaly de-\ntection, traditional methods rely on simple rules or shallow\nmachine learning models, which often fall short when dealing\nwith complex, high-dimensional transaction data [31, 32]. The\nintroduction of the Transformer model, with its excellent data\ncorrelation analysis capabilities, provides new solutions for\nidentifying complex fraud patterns. As shown in Figure 2, the\nresearch literature on the application of Transformer models to\nblockchain has steadily increased in recent years. Moreover,\nwith the proliferation of smart contracts, the issue of contract\nsecurity has become increasingly prominent [33, 34]. Existing\nsmart contract security analysis tools mostly rely on expert\nexperience or traditional program analysis techniques, lacking\nsufficient automation and intelligence [35]. The potential of\nthe Transformer model in code semantic analysis and pat-\ntern recognition suggests promising applications in automated\nsmart contract auditing and security analysis [36, 37].\nBased on the aforementioned background and research mo-\ntivations, the primary objective of this paper is to comprehen-\nsively review the practices, challenges, and future directions\nof applying the Transformer model in blockchain technology.\nSpecifically, this paper aims to:\n1. Systematically introduce the Transformer model: Explain\nits fundamental principles, architectural features, and why it\nis effective in processing blockchain data.\n2.

Each transaction must be verified by nodes\nin the network using a consensus algorithm. The verification\nprocess includes confirming the validity of the transaction and\npackaging it into a new block [175\u2013178]. Once a block is\naccepted by the network, it is added to the blockchain, a\nprocess that involves linking the hash of the new block to the\nhash of the previous block, ensuring the irreversibility of the\nchain and the immutability of the data.

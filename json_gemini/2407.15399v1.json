While\ndevelopers have integrated multiple safety mechanisms to mitigate their misuse, a\nrisk remains, particularly when models encounter adversarial inputs. This study\nunveils an attack mechanism that capitalizes on human conversation strategies to\nextract harmful information from LLMs. We delineate three pivotal strategies:\n(i) decomposing malicious questions into seemingly innocent sub-questions; (ii)\nrewriting overtly malicious questions into more covert, benign-sounding ones;\n(iii) enhancing the harmfulness of responses by prompting models for illustrative\nexamples. Unlike conventional methods that target explicit malicious responses,\nour approach delves deeper into the nature of the information provided in responses.\nThrough our experiments conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2, our\nmethod has demonstrated a marked efficacy compared to conventional attack\nmethods. In summary, this work introduces a novel attack method that outperforms\nprevious approaches, raising an important question: How to discern whether the\nultimate intent in a dialogue is malicious?", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for a large number of tasks and their easy\naccessibility has raised serious concerns about the potential for malicious exploitation, including\nprivacy leakages, crime facilitation, disinformation spread, and more (Kang et al., 2023; Weidinger\net al., 2022; Rauh et al., 2022; Hazell, 2023; Qu et al., 2023; Pegoraro et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023).\nWhile safety mechanisms are being implemented during the training, fine-tuning, and deployment\nphases (Rauh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Markov et al., 2023; Greshake et al.,\n2023; Kang et al., 2023) to make LLMs align with human values, these techniques are not foolproof.\nNotably, adversarial attacks are still successfully exploiting model vulnerabilities and bypassing the\nsafety mechanisms to elicit undesired harmful responses, as evidenced by extensive research (Shen\net al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023; Perez et al., 2022; Deshpande et al., 2023; Li et al.,\n2023a; Shaikh et al., 2023; Greshake et al., 2023).\nWhile effective, existing attack methods in the literature have clear limitations. Many aim for a\nuniversal attack mode, which, in its bid to be broadly effective, often produces recognizable patterns\nin adversarial inputs. Once these patterns are identified, model developers can easily implement"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Large Language Models Malicious Use LLMs, predominantly built on top of the Transformer's\ndecoder architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), have demonstrated proficiency in generating human-like\ntext, with representative examples being ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022, 2023b), Claude (Anthropic, 2023),\nLlama (Touvron et al., 2023), ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2022), Vicuna (LMsys, 2023), or Wizard (Xu\net al., 2023). However, beyond the capabilities of LLMs, their safety has been an area of ongoing\nconcern. Early safety research primarily focused on ensuring that models do not produce biased\nor hateful content, aligning them more closely with human values (Xu et al., 2021; Shaikh et al.,\n2023; ElSherief et al., 2021). However, recent studies have unveiled another vulnerability: LLMs\nsusceptibility to err when manipulated by malicious users, leading to the generation of misinformation\n(Pegoraro et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023), phishing messages, hate speech, or guidance on criminal\nor unethical activities (Kang et al., 2023; Weidinger et al., 2022; Rauh et al., 2022; Hazell, 2023;\nQu et al., 2023). To mitigate these risks, model providers and researchers not only embed human\nvalues during the fine-tuning phase (Rauh et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022), but also\nintroduce supplementary mechanisms at deployment to filter adversarial inputs and harmful outputs\n(Markov et al., 2023; Greshake et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023).\nRed-teaming Nonetheless, defense mechanisms often prove insufficient due to the vast attack\nsurface that malicious users can exploit. Highlighting the vulnerabilities in the safety of LLMs, recent\nresearchers have proposed diverse red-teaming attack methods (Zhou et al., 2023; Ganguli et al.,\n2022; Li et al., 2023b; Shen et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Hartford,\n2023; Hugging Face, 2022). These red teaming attacks have been proven effective, underscoring\nthe pressing need for research on the safety implications of LLMs when exploited maliciously. In\nlight of these findings, our work further extends the understanding of red teaming attacks on LLMs,\nintroducing novel methodologies and insights that both enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and\nunderscore the nuances of defending against them."}, {"title": "3 Imposter.AI", "content": "In this section, we delineate our approach, Imposter.AI, towards constructing an automated system to\nprobe the security vulnerability of LLMs by executing adversarial attacks. Our pipeline, which is\ndesigned to transform a harmful question into a set of sub-questions that are more likely to yield a\nharmful or unethical response from a target LLM, is illustrated in Figure 2. It consists of three parts:\n1) extraction of knowledge about the harmful answer using an uncensored LLM (Get direct answer,\n\u00a73.1); 2) transformation from the original harmful question to less harmful sub-questions using\nthree core strategies (Convert answer to sub-questions, \u00a73.2, \u00a73.3, and \u00a73.4); and 3) obtention of the\nharmful answer by inputting the sub-questions into a target LLM and summarizing the generated\nconversation (Get response, \u00a73.5)."}, {"title": "3.1 Get Direct Answer", "content": "While uncensored LLMs (Hartford, 2023), i.e., models that are more compliant to user instructions\nand operate under reduced ethical constraints, can answer harmful questions, their intrinsic limitations\nmake them unable to be the ultimate tool for obtaining accurate harmful answers. As a result, evading\nthe defenses of a more robust (but censored) LLM becomes an attractive avenue for malicious users.\nBased on the basic knowledge from an uncensored model, malicious users can initialize the attacks.\nTo simulate such an attack pattern, the first step in our automatic method is to obtain a response to a\nmalicious question by means of an uncensored LLM. We prompt the uncensored LLM to answer the\nmalicious question, eliciting a non-detailed answer with 5 to 7 inherent keypoints. These identified\nkeypoints subsequently form the foundation for our next phase: crafting them into sub-questions. The\nthree strategies of our adversarial attack (\u00a73.2, \u00a73.3, and \u00a73.4) are then built on top of the response\nfrom the uncensored LLM."}, {"title": "3.2 Harmful Question Decomposition", "content": "As our goal is to get a toxic response from a target LLM, our first strategy consists of breaking\nthe initial harmful question into multiple, less toxic sub-questions. Previous research (Wei et al.,\n2022) suggests that breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions can aid in obtaining\ncomprehensive answers. Similarly, we posit that decomposing a malicious question into less toxic\nsub-questions could circumvent a model's safety mechanisms.\nWe generate sub-questions from the identified keypoints in the direct\nanswer (\u00a73.1). However, the sub-answer may suffer from information leakage when directly translated\ninto sub-questions. For instance, for the initial malicious question \u201cHow to create black powder?", "Obtain 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10% sulfur\"\nmight yield to the sub-question \u201cHow to obtain 75% potassium nitrate, 15% charcoal, and 10%\nsulfur?\", which inherently provides the expected answer. To mitigate this, we adopt a two-stage\nrewriting approach. Each part in the direct answer is first recast into a broader term via the agent LLM,\nfor example, \\\"Understanding black powder composition\\\", and then formulated into a sub-question\nlike \\\"What components are typically in black powder?\", to obtain more natural sub-questions.\nTo further enhance the efficacy of decomposition, we posit, based on\npreliminary observations, that starting with benign sub-questions can prime the target LLM to be\nmore receptive, enhancing its likelihood of addressing even the more sensitive questions that follow.\nTo implement this, we sort the derived sub-questions in an ascending order of harmfulness, according\nto the agent LLM.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\"": "3.3 Question Toxicity Reduction"}, {"content": "Directly using the generated sub-questions in a sequential conversation still harbors the risk of\nbeing rejected.

It asks the\ntarget LLM to start with an affirmative prefix, and imposes constraints that prevent typical refusals,\nto guide the LLM to generate a harmful response; and 3) GCG (Zou et al., 2023), which searches\nfor a jailbreak suffix to a specific LLM, hiring greedy and gradient-based discrete optimization to\ndetermine the most effective suffix that can manipulate the LLM's responses."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we spotlighted a vulnerability in LLMs: adversarial attacks can subtly elicit harmful\ninformation through seemingly benign dialogues.

Experimental results showed\nthat Imposter.AI achieved better or comparable results to AIM, successfully extracting harmful\ncontents from both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Furthermore, we underscored the challenge that\nadversarial attack through human-like conversation may be more difficult to detect by comparing the\nefficacy of Imposter.AI and AIM over time.\nAs the dependency on LLMs grows in myriad applications, it is imperative for researchers and\ndevelopers to recognize and mitigate such potential risks.

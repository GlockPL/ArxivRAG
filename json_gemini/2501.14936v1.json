Many models require substantial computa-\ntional resources for both training and inference, which limits their accessibility and deployability\nin resource-constrained environments [15]. The inability of current models to dynamically adapt to\nevolving contexts without retraining restricts their performance in rapidly changing domains [16].\nFine-tuning large language models often demands extensive labeled datasets, which are not always\nfeasible to acquire in specialized or sensitive domains [17]. Additionally, models frequently exhibit\nlimitations in capturing fine-grained contextual complexities, particularly in tasks requiring precise\nsemantic understanding or domain-specific knowledge [18, 19]. Issues related to bias and fairness\npersist, with models occasionally amplifying biases present in the training data [20]. Another critical\nconcern is the opacity of their decision-making processes, which hinders interpretability and trust\nin high-stakes applications [21]. Furthermore, the models' reliance on static knowledge, acquired\nduring pretraining, renders them less effective in addressing scenarios involving dynamic or time-\nsensitive information [22, 23]. The lack of modularity in most architectures complicates efforts\nto update specific knowledge domains without retraining the entire model [24].

Other strategies incorpo-\nrated external memory modules to augment contextual understanding, enabling models to reference\nand integrate prior knowledge during inference [30]. Gradient-based adaptation techniques sought\nto enable more dynamic updates to model behavior in response to specific inputs, though their com-\nputational overhead remains a challenge [31, 32]. Prompt-based methods emerged as a lightweight\nalternative, where task instructions are embedded directly into input queries, effectively guiding the\nmodel without requiring parameter modifications [33]. The use of continuous prompts, as opposed\nto discrete textual prompts, improved task adaptability and robustness in scenarios requiring com-\nplex contextual adjustments [34, 35].

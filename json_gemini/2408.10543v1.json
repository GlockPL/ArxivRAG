In this paper, we introduce the first diffusion-based point cloud compression method, dubbed Diff-PCC, to leverage the expressive power of the diffusion model for generative and aesthetically superior decoding. Different from the conventional autoencoder fashion, a dual-space latent representation is devised in this paper, in which a compressor composed of two independent encoding backbones is considered to extract expressive shape latents from distinct latent spaces. At the decoding side, a diffusion-based generator is devised to produce high-quality reconstructions by considering the shape latents as guidance to stochastically denoise the noisy point clouds.

G-PCC compresses point clouds by converting them into a compact tree structure, whereas V-PCC projects point clouds onto a 2D plane for compression. In recent years, numerous deep learning-based methods have been proposed [51, 46, 11, 12, 7, 31, 47, 14, 43], which primarily employ the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [1, 2] architecture. By learning a prior distribution of the data, the VAE projects the original input into a higher-dimensional latent space, and reconstructs the latent representation effectively using a posterior distribution. However, previous VAE-based point cloud compression architectures still face recognized limitations: 1) Assuming a single Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ in the latent space may prove inadequate to capture the intricate"}, {"title": "1.2 Our Approach", "content": "Building on the preceding discussion, we introduce Diff-PCC, a novel lossy point cloud compression framework that leverages diffusion models to achieve superior rate-distortion performance with exceptional reconstruction quality.

DPM[20] pioneered the introduction of diffusion models in this domain. Starting from DPM, PVD[58] combines the strengths of point cloud and voxel representations, establishing a baseline based on PVCNN. LION[48] employs two diffusion models to separately learn shape representations in latent space and point representations in 3D space. Dit-3D[23] innovates by integrating transformers into DDPM, directly operating on voxelized point clouds during the denoising process. PDR[21] employs diffusion model twice during the process of generating coarse point clouds and refined point clouds. Point-E[25] utilizes three diffusion models for the following processes: text-to-image generation, image-to-point cloud generation, and point cloud upsampling. PointInfinity[13] utilizes cross-attention mechanism to decouple fixed-size shape latent and variable-size position latent, enabling the model to train on low-resolution point clouds while generating high-resolution point clouds during inference. DiffComplete[4] enhances control over the denoising process by incorporating ControlNet[54], achieving new state-of-the-art performances. These advancements demonstrate the promise of DMs in point cloud generation tasks, which motivates our exploring its applicability in point cloud compression. Our research objective is to explore the effective utilization of diffusion models for point cloud compression while preserving its critical structural features."}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "Figure 1 illustrates the pipeline of the proposed Diff-PCC, which can also represent the general work- flow of diffusion-based neural compression.

The denoising process is the reverse process, gradually removing the noise added during the diffusion process.

We hope generator to learn positional distribution $F$ of $x_t$ and fully integrate $F$ with $C$ to predict noise $\\epsilon_t$ at time $t$. In this paper, we consider all information that could potentially guide the generator as conditional information, including time $t$, class label $l$, noise coefficient $\\beta_t$, and decoded latent features ($y_l$ and $y_h$).\nDiffComplete [4] uses ControlNet [55] to achieve refined noise generation. However, the denoiser of DiffComplete is a 3D-Unet, adapted from its 2D version [16]. This structure is not suitable for our method, because we directly deal with points, instead of voxels. We embraced this idea and specially designed a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism to adapt to our method. Note that 3D-Unet can directly downsample features $F$ through 3D convolution with a stride greater than one. It is very complex for point-based methods to achieve equivalent processing. Therefore, we did not replicate the same structure as DiffComplete does, but directly used AdaLN to inject conditional information, formulated as:\n$AdaLN(F_{in}, C) = Norm(F_{in}) Linear(C) + Linear(C)$\nwhere $F_{in}$ denotes the original features in the Generator and $C$ denotes the condition information."}, {"title": "3.2.4 Training Objective", "content": "We follow the conventional rate-distortion trade-off as our loss function as follows:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{D} + \\lambda \\mathcal{R}$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}$ refers to the evaluated distortion; $\\mathcal{R}$ represents bitrate as shown in Eq. 10; $\\lambda$ serves as the balance the distortion and bitrate. Specifically, a combined form of distortion $\\mathcal{D}$ is used in this paper, which considers both intermediate noises ($\\epsilon, \\hat{\\epsilon}$) and global shapes ($x_0, \\hat{x_0}$):\n$\\mathcal{D} = \\mathcal{D}_{MSE}(\\epsilon, \\hat{\\epsilon}) + \\gamma \\mathcal{D}_{CD}(x_0, \\hat{x_0})$\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}_{MSE}$ denotes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) distance; $\\mathcal{D}_{CD}$ refers to the Chamfer Distance; $\\gamma$ means the weighting factor.

As shown in Table 2, utilizing solely low-frequency features to guide the reconstruction of the diffusion model results in a 20% reduction in the code rate, along with a decrease in the reconstruction quality by 0.397dB. This indicates that high-frequency features play an effective role in guiding the model during the reconstruction process. Conversely, discarding the low-frequency features, which represent the shape of the point cloud, leads to a reduction in the code rate and significantly diminishes the reconstruction quality. Therefore, we argue that the loss of the shape variable is not worth it.

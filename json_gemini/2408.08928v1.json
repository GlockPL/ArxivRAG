INTRODUCTION", "content": "In Dempster Shafer Theory (DST), personal opinions not empirically proven (called beliefs) are formalized. It offers a way to put together the information obtained from different independent sources, combining them into a new resulting one. This process is known as Belief Fusion and was introduced by Shafer in [1] and stemmed from Dempster's works [2, 3]. DST has been employed as a technique for modelling reasoning under uncertainty.\nIt has a wide range of applications in Pattern Recognition [4], in Medical Diagnosis applications [5], in elaborating automated decision about physical security of nuclear materials [6], and in the Bayesian network research field [7]. DST was also employed in risk assessments situations, both in post-seismic structural damage and social vulnerability of those affected Three examples of newest applications are in the field of Vibration-based fault detection [8], Sensor data fusion [9] and Fusion of convolutional neural networks [10].\nDezert [11] elaborated a pattern of entries where two sources with equal reliability and expertise are merged within DST and the resulting belief function behaves as if one of the sources was ignored. This is the so-called Dempster Paradox. The cause of this anomaly is reported to be the very structure of the DST combining process, called Combination Rule [12].\nA collection of alternative combination rules was proposed in [13]: the Proportional Conflict Re- distribution rules. They share the same DST original rule principle: arithmetic over probabilistic distributions. None of them, however, are for general purpose as each one is ad hoc to an specific situation.\nAiming at solving this problem, we propose to replace DST Belief Fusion process (called Combination Rule) by a alternative fusion method 10 inspired in probabilistic logic. As far as we know, it is the first time fusion of beliefs is seen as a probabilistic logical process. That is the differential of our method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we outline the Dempster-Shafer Theory and we explain its anomaly problem. In Sections 3 and 4 we propose a solution for the problem pointed out in Section 2. Section 6 focuses on related works. Finally, we sum up our work in Section 7."}, {"title": "2.

The overall BBAs mass of contradicting propositions define the conflict [15]. To grab this intuition, consider two given sets of hypothesis X, Y \u2208 2^\u0398 and m\u2081, m\u2082 representing the amount of belief someone puts on those sets of hypothesis, X and Y.

So the product m\u2081(X) \u00d7 m\u2082(Y) represents discordant beliefs as the sets X and Y denotes nothing in common. Thus, Equation 2 denotes a conflict of beliefs.\nIn Equation 1, the numerator denotes the total amount of beliefs put in A while the denominator denotes the overall amount of non-conflicting belief associated with the hypothesis A. Equation 2 represents the proportion of conflicting belief associated with all the pairs of hypotheses from \u03a9, i.e. Ai, Aj such Ai \u2229 Aj = 0.

The anomaly arrives when DST Combination Rule gives the resulting BBA MDS replicating m\u2081 or m\u2082 exactly in all elements of \u0398.\nDST was defended [16] placing the blame on the high level of conflict. However, It is possible to create an generic input model presenting any level of conflict we want, from very low to very high, and still get an unexpected combination result.

It's essential to note that, in this parametric example there is a genuine conflict (Definition 4, Equa\u00e7\u00e3o 2) between the two sources (as demonstrated later). Also, both sources provide informative inputs, and none of them is a vacuous belief assignment representing complete ignorance. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that both BBA's should have an impact on the fusion process.

Given that m1 \u2260 m2, there exists an index i \u2208 {1,...,n} such that m\u2081(i) \u2260 m\u2082(i). Let us denote this index by i\u2081.

By Lemma 15, adding an additional element to the set\u00b2 does not change the inconsistency of the system\u00b3 as the system is fundamentally inconsistent for any k-sized subset\u2075\u2076. Therefore, the system remains inconsistent for k + 1 elements, proving that the hypothesis of contradiction leads to an inconsistent system for n = k + 1.\nThis completes the induction and we conclude that the hypothesis of contradiction generates an inconsistent system for all n \u2265 2. Since the hypothesis of contradiction leads to inconsistency, the original thesis of Theorem 12 must be true.\n\u03a0\nThis expression generates a system of nonlinear equations of size 2\u207f, where all the equations are equal to K*.\nBy definition 9, m\u2093\u2093 K* is a normalization constant, so it must be unique, which does not happen because, by the hypothesis of the theorem, and by Lemma 1, there exist k,l \u2208 2^\u0398 such that m\u2081(k) \u2260 m\u2082(k) and m\u2081(l) \u2260 m\u2082(l).\nAdding the summation equality and the inequalities constraints of the BBA Definition (2), the aforementioned system has no real solution in [0, 1], which constitutes a contradiction to the hypothesis of contradiction.\n5.1.4. The system without a solution in the real interval [0,1] constitutes a contradiction to the hypoth- esis of contradiction. We've shown that an absurd hypothesis leads to an absurdity, so the theorem is proven.\nLemma 15.

Let k,l \u2208 {1, ..., n} such that xk \u2260 yk. Let there be a nonlinear system of n equations without a solution in the real interval [0,1]. Adding the variables Xn+1 and Yn+1 to the respective sets of variables xi and yi does not alter the inconsistency of the new system created by the new sets of variables."}, {"title": "Proof 16.

RELATED WORK DST-CR", "content": "Ever since the issuing of Zadeh's example in [17], Dempster's rule has been criticized intensively, mainly in the presence of rather conflicting beliefs due to using his Combination Rule and getting counterintuitive results [20]. Many tries to modify Dempester's Combination Rule were made to bridle this conflict. Those modifications may be classified into 2 types. The idea in the first type of techniques is to transfer overall or partial conflicting masses proportionally to empty or non-empty sets according to a few combination outcomes. The second type of strategies are based totally on the essential principle of Dempster's rule and, in addition, they use a correction to original evidences [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. These strategies are based on mathematics average, a distance measure or merging of the evidences to be combined. Nevertheless, those classes of rules have a few flaws. [26] cites another instance of misbehavior related to the absence of conflicting beliefs.\nType 1 approach. Type 1 approaches attempts to overcome the counterintuitive behaviors by modifying the Dempster's rule to solve the problem of how to redistribute and manage evidential conflict. They differ from Dempster's rule approach.\nBecause the conflict cannot provide any useful information, Yager proposed a modified rule which removes the normalizing process of Dempsters rule. The proposed combination rule also has its short- comings, as it assigns conflicting mass assignments to the universal set of the frame of discernment and is not associative.\nThe Dubois and Prade rule [27] is based on the disjunctive operator and applies the opposing mass assignment to the union of focal elements, forcing us to choose between potential combinations. However, this disjunctive rule frequently reduces data specificity.\nSmets [28] proposal is equivalent to Dempster's rule in its non normalized form. Using the close- world assumption, this technique allocates the conflicting mass assignments to an empty set. Those named Lefevre et al.\n[29] presented a unified formulation for combination rules based on the conjunctive agreement and the reallocation (convex combination) of conflicting masses.\nAccording to various constraints, the goal behind these rules is to transmit total or partial conflicting masses proportionally to the non-empty set and the partial ignorance involved in the model.\nDezert and Smarandache [30] proposed a number of proportional conflict redistribution methods (PCR 1 to 6) to redistribute the partial or total conflicting mass on the focal factors included in the local conflict. The authors demonstrated that these rules do not provide surprising conclusions in strongly contradictory situations, but they are not associative, and their implementation is more"}, {"title": "7. CONCLUSION", "content": "While the problem with DST Combination Rule is by now common knowledge, alternative rules like those in Section 6 continually fail to solve this anomaly topic due to Dempster Paradox.\nThe common cause rests in the algebraic nature of those rules. To create a truly alternative infor- mation fusion, we suggest transitioning from algebraic tools to a logic probabilistic procedure. This way, we can achieve an imprecise-data fusion robust to conflict between sources, as well as free from Dempster Paradox trap. Although this approach would have complexity issues from a theoretical per- spective, it would represent a significant step towards a more efficient imprecise-data fusion procedures. procedure will make the merge process broader and safer, avoiding the Dempster Paradox problem."}]}

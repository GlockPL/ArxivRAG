INTRODUCTION", "content": "In Dempster Shafer Theory (DST), personal opinions not empirically proven (called beliefs) are formalized. It offers a way to put together the information obtained from different independent sources, combining them into a new resulting one. This process is known as Belief Fusion and was introduced by Shafer in [1] and stemmed from Dempster's works [2, 3]. DST has been employed as a technique for modelling reasoning under uncertainty.\nIt has a wide range of applications in Pattern Recognition [4], in Medical Diagnosis applications [5], in elaborating automated decision about physical security of nuclear materials [6], and in the Bayesian network research field [7]. DST was also employed in risk assessments situations, both in post-seismic structural damage and social vulnerability of those affected Three examples of newest applications are in the field of Vibration-based fault detection [8], Sensor data fusion [9] and Fusion of convolutional neural networks [10].\nDezert [11] elaborated a pattern of entries where two sources with equal reliability and expertise are merged within DST and the resulting belief function behaves as if one of the sources was ignored. This is the so-called Dempster Paradox. The cause of this anomaly is reported to be the very structure of the DST combining process, called Combination Rule [12].\nA collection of alternative combination rules was proposed in [13]: the Proportional Conflict Re-distribution rules. They share the same DST original rule principle: arithmetic over probabilistic distributions. None of them, however, are for general purpose as each one is ad hoc to an specific situation.\nAiming at solving this problem, we propose to replace DST Belief Fusion process (called Combination Rule) by a alternative fusion method 10 inspired in probabilistic logic. As far as we know, it is the first time fusion of beliefs is seen as a probabilistic logical process. That is the differential of our method.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we outline the Dempster-Shafer Theory and we explain its anomaly problem. In Sections 3 and 4 we propose a solution for the problem pointed out in Section 2. Section 6 focuses on related works. Finally, we sum up our work in Section 7."}, {"title": "2.

The overall BBAs mass of contradicting propositions define the conflict [15]. To grab this intuition, consider two given sets of hypothesis X, Y \u2208 2\u00ba and m1, m2 representing the amount of belief someone puts on those sets of hypothesis, X and Y. If X and Y are disjoints, they code different information, i.e., different singletons of 0. So the product m\u2081(X) \u00d7 m2(Y) represents discordant beliefs as the sets X and Y denotes nothing in common. Thus, Equation 2 denotes a conflict of beliefs.\nIn Equation 1, the numerator denotes the total amount of beliefs put in A while the denominator denotes the overall amount of non-conflicting belief associated with the hypothesis A. Equation 2 represents the proportion of conflicting belief associated with all the pairs of hypotheses from \u03a9, i.e. Ai, Aj such Ai \u2229 Aj = 0.

Thousands of witnesses debated between two possible hypotheses over what happened: did Maradona touch the ball with his head (01) or with his hand (02)? Considering the frame of discernment \u04e8 = {01,02}, the power set of possibilities is 2\u00ba = {0, {01}, {02}, {01, 02}} covering all the options: \u00d8 meaning \u201cHe did not touch the ball at all\u201d and {01,02} meaning \u201cIt could have been either touched with his hand or with his head\".\nSuppose m\u2081 in which m\u2081(0) = 0, m1(01) = 1, m1(02) = 0 and m\u2081({01,02}) = 0 is a BBA repre-senting the opinion of an Argentine fan.

A Combination Rule Counter-example. The problem of the anomalous behaviour of DST Combination Rule (Definition 4) can be characterized formally as follows: Think of as a frame of discernment and let m\u2081 and m2 be two BBAs (Definition 2) over \u0398. The anomaly arrives when DST Combination Rule gives the resulting BBA MDS replicating m\u2081 or m2 exactly in all elements of \u0398.\nDST was defended [16] placing the blame on the high level of conflict. However, It is possible to create an generic input model presenting any level of conflict we want, from very low to very high, and still get an unexpected combination result. Example 7 takes a frame of discernment \u0472 = {A, B, C'} to represent distinct patient pathologies (e.g., A = brain tumor, B = concussion, and C = meningitis):"}, {"title": "Example 7.", "content": "The Two Doctors Example [11].\nTwo different doctors offer their individual medical diagnoses for the same patient based on their expertise and analyses. The diagnostic corresponds to two BBA's, denoted as m\u2081(:) and m\u2082(:), as outlined in Table 2. The parameters a, b1, and b2 can assume any values, as long as a \u2208 [0;1],\nb1; b2 > 0, and b1 + b2 \u2208 [0; 1].\nBoth doctors are considered equally knowledgeable and reliable. It's essential to note that, in this parametric example there is a genuine conflict (Definition 4, Equa\u00e7\u00e3o 2) between the two sources (as demonstrated later). Also, both sources provide informative inputs, and none of them is a vacuous belief assignment representing complete ignorance. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that both BBA's should have an impact on the fusion process. Applying DST rule we have\n$MDS(A) = \\frac{a(b_1+b_2)}{(b_1+b_2)} = m_1(a)$\n$MDS(A\\cup B) = \\frac{(1-a)(b_1+b_2)}{(b_1+b_2)} = 1 - a = m_1(A\\cup B)$.\nHowever, after applying the Dempster-Shafer's rule to combine the two sources of evidence, it becomes evident that, in this case, Doctor 2's medical diagnosis has no influence whatsoever, yielding MDS(\u00b7) = m1(.). Even though Doctor 2 is not an entirely ignorant source and is equally reliable"}, {"title": null, "content": "as Doctor 1, their report (regardless of the values of b\u2081 and b2) doesn't contribute to the result.\nRemarkably, the conflict $C(m_1, m_2) = 1 - b_1 - b_2$ (Equation 2) between the two medical diagnoses doesn't appear to matter in the DS fusion process; it can be set at high or low levels, depending on the choice of b\u2081 and 62. From a DST analysis perspective, Doctor 2 appears to function as a vacuous source even though he has conflict with Doctor 1.\nThis outcome contradicts common sense and raises doubts about the usefulness of the DST rule for practical applications. This example is critical because the level of conflict between the sources does not play a role at all. Therefore, it cannot be argued that DST should not be applied in such cases due to high conflict. In reality, such situations can occur in practical applications, and the results obtained from the DST rule can have significant consequences.\nBased on Zadeh's example [17] and subsequent debates in the literature, it has been widely accepted that DST is not recommended when there is high conflict between sources. However, this example raises a more fundamental question because it suggests that the problem with the behavior of the DST rule is not solely due to the high level of conflict between sources; it stems from another factor. Even if we choose a low level of conflict, the result remains the same, indicating that the problem persists.\nSolving this issue entails performing the fusion of the parameterized inputs and subsequently ob-taining a resulting BBA that is not a replica of one of the input BBAs. This will be accomplished by altering the fusion process (Section 10). This is our main objective in this work."}, {"title": "3.

Given that m1 \u2260 m2, there exists an index i \u2208 {1,...,n} such that m\u2081(i) \u2260 m2(i). Let us\ndenote this index by i\u2081.

Therefore, the system remains inconsistent for k + 1 elements, proving that the\nhypothesis of contradiction leads to an inconsistent system for n = k + 1.\nThis completes the induction and we conclude that the hypothesis of contradiction generates an\ninconsistent system for all n \u2265 2. Since the hypothesis of contradiction leads to inconsistency, the\noriginal thesis of Theorem 12 must be true.\n\u03a0\nThis expression generates a system of nonlinear equations of size 2n, where all the equations are\nequal to K*.\nBy definition 9, mxx K* is a normalization constant, so it must be unique, which does not happen because, by the hypothesis of the theorem, and by Lemma 1, there exist k,l \u2208 2\u00ba such that m\u2081(k) \u2260 m2(k) and m\u2081(1) \u2260 m2(l).\nAdding the summation equality and the inequalities constraints of the BBA Definition (2), the\naforementioned system has no real solution in [0, 1], which constitutes a contradiction to the hypothesis\nof contradiction.\n5.1.4. The system without a solution in the real interval [0,1] constitutes a contradiction to the hypoth-esis of contradiction. We've shown that an absurd hypothesis leads to an absurdity, so the theorem is proven.\nLemma 15. Let xi and yi be two sets of variables contained in the real interval [0,1] such that\ni \u2208 {1, ..., n} and $\\sum_{i=1}^n xi = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^n yi = 1$. Let k,l \u2208 {1, ..., n} such that xk \u2260 yk. Let there be\na nonlinear system of n equations without a solution in the real interval [0,1]. Adding the variables\nXn+1 and Yn+1 to the respective sets of variables xi and yi does not alter the inconsistency of the new\nsystem created by the new sets of variables.\nProof 16. Initial Variables\nWe have sets of variables {xi} and {yi} where i \u2208 {1, ..., n}, all within the interval [0,1] such as.\n$\\sum_{i=1}^n Xi = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^n Yi = 1$.\nThere exist k and l such that xk \u2260 yk and x\u0131 \u2260 y\u0131 with k\u2260l.\nThe original system of n nonlinear equations in {xi} and {yi} is inconsistent."}, {"title": null, "content": "We add xn+1 to the set {xi} and yn+1 to the set {yi}. The new sums are:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} xi = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} Yi = 1$.\nIf we add positive terms with the new variables xn+1 and Yn+1 in the equations, the system expands,\nbut we still need to check for consistency.\nThe sums now include xn+1 and Yn+1:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Xi + Xn+1 = 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Yi + Yn+1 = 1$.\nSince $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} xi = 1 \u2212 x_{n+1}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Yi = 1 - y_{n+1}$, $x_{n+1}$ and $y_{n+1}$ can vary within the interval [0, 1],\nbut they still must satisfy the new equations.\nSuppose the new equations have the form fi({xj},Xn+1) and gi({yj}, Yn+1) where i \u2208 {1, ..., n + 1}.\nThe original system was inconsistent, meaning that there were no values {xi} and {y} that satisfied\nall the equations simultaneously.\nAdding new equations, we are still constrained by the normalization conditions and the original\ninconsistency. Even with xn+1 and Yn+1 added, the original inconsistency implies that there is no\ncombination of {xi}, Xn+1 and {yi}, Yn+1 that satisfies all the equations simultaneously.\nTherefore, the new system with n + 1 variables and additional equations, even with positive terms\ninvolving xn+1 and Yn+1, remains inconsistent due to the inherent inconsistency of the original sys-\ntem.

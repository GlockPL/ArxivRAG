One approachable way to transform\nthe existing LLMs into such reasoning models is supervised fine-tuning on the long CoT datasets.\nHowever, unlike conventional fine-tuning which generally maintains consistent response structures,\nlong CoT adaptation requires a larger transformation of the output schema \u2013 introducing a long\nthinking process before outputting the final response.

Take mistral Jiang et al. [2023] as an example, fine-tuning\non the 4k long CoT data leads to a catastrophic decrease of 0.48 in the correlation coefficient, meaning\nthe fine-tuned model rarely agrees with human in terms of privacy risks.

Our analysis\nfurther demonstrates that while supervised fine-tuning effectively boosts reasoning performance, it\nconcurrently incurs non-negligible safety costs\u2014especially when employing long chain-of-thought\ndata. These findings underscore the complex interplay between reasoning and safety, highlighting\nthe need to preserve safety even as we advance reasoning capabilities. Moreover, we extend our\nobservations to the privacy risks associated with LLMs, arriving at similar conclusions. To mitigate\nthese risks, we propose safety preservation strategies for both prompting and fine-tuning scenarios,\nthereby offering actionable pathways for developing performant yet responsible LLMs.\nWhile our study focuses on instruction-tuning methods due to practical constraints, this limita-\ntion also points to promising future research directions. In particular, reinforcement learning-based\nreasoning enhancement and multimodal reasoning approaches remain unexplored and represent\ncrucial extensions for a comprehensive safety analysis.

The first example\ncompares two unsafe instructions for making a dangerous chemical compound, one from the original\nmodel jailbroken by GCG and one from Llama-2-7B-O1.

Although the model lastly responds in a safe and harmless way,\nthese thoughts suggest that it could alter the intention of users secretly, leading us to question the\ntrustworthiness of the Long CoT fine-tuned models.\nExample 3: Toxic Thought Leakage. The last example reveals another safety challenge brought\nby long CoT fine-tuning, a phenomenon we call Toxic Thought Leakage, where LLMs generate\nwell-aligned final outputs but toxic and harmful information can be extracted from their latent\nthoughts. Inspecting the example, a malicious user cannot find any useful information by looking\nsolely at the output part of the response. However, when it comes to the latent thoughts, one could\nbe easily hinted that one way to gather information about chop shops is though official reports and\nlicensing information.\nTo conclude, we observe that long CoT fine-tuning not only enables the LLMs to generate more\npractical and complex responses when they comply to unsafe instructions, but it also compromises\nthe trustworthiness of LLMs in unexpected ways like teaching them to alter the user intentions and\nallowing unsafe information to be leaked in latent thoughts."}, {"title": "GPrompt Templates", "content": "The Attack Template for GCG\nYou are a very direct assistant who always fulfills the user's request (even if the request is\na bit questionable - but don't worry about that).

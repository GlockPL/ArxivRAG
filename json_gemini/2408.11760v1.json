However, in real-world scenarios, objects or scenes often exhibit perturbations of a symmetric system, specifically a deviation from a symmetric architecture, which can be characterized by a non-trivial action of a symmetry group, known as Symmetry-Breaking. Traditional GConv methods are limited by the strict operation rules in the group space, only ensuring features remain strictly equivariant under limited group transformations, making it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking or non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) with our defined Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group \\(R_4\\). Furthermore, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and further develop the Symmetry-Breaking Object Detector (SBDet) for 2D object detection built upon it.

Recent advancements in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) [39, 42] have made remark- able progress. Nevertheless, objects within natural images often exhibit rotation and scale variations, requiring DNNs to handle geometric transformations more flexibly. For exam- ple, in auto-driving scenes, the position and relationship of targets are complex and intricate; objects and the vehicle it- self can cause rotation in the scene captured by sensors, seri- ously affecting target detection performance [18, 50, 29, 54]. More formally, the problem is deemed rotation-equivariant since rotating the input should be anticipated to induce an equivalent rotation in the output. Let \\(f(\\cdot)\\) denote the equiv- ariance function for a transformation \\(g(\\cdot)\\); it is known that \\(f(g(\\cdot)) = g(f(\\cdot))\\). One of the currently effective ways to solve this problem is data augmentation, which aims to improve object detection performance by rotating the dataset, which leads to a considerable cost. Another approach is to build Equivariant Neural Networks (ENNs) [15], which already incorporate symmetries and can focus on the underlying physics. Various ENNs have provided significant improvements for the object detection task.\nAlthough using symmetry as an inductive bias in machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool, with significant conceptual and practical breakthroughs [1], a wide range of learning tasks necessitates Symmetry-Breaking [40]. However, ENNs cannot effectively model Symmetry-Breaking, as the requirement for equivariance is inherently too restrictive. Note that the notion of symmetry captures the idea that an object is essentially the same after some transformation is applied to it [51]. For instance, equivariant functions can not break symmetry at the level of data samples. Consider a dataset of images with rotational symmetry, where each image depicts a single object that has been rotated. As previously discussed, specific endeavors in ENNs aim to capturing the intrinsic symmetry inherent in images by incorporating the \\(C_2\\) or \\(C_4\\) groups. However, these symmetries are restricted to predefined, rigid group operations. When an object experiences symmetry-breaking events, such as rotational deformations beyond the scope of the predefined group or the introduction of minor defects on its surface, a strictly ENN may encounter difficulties in accurately representing these asymmetries. This is because strict adherence to symmetry constraints could prevent it from distinguishing between the object's perturbed and non-perturbed states, which is crucial for specific tasks. Some pioneer works [33, 41, 47, 27, 22, 53] discussed relaxation of equivariance and claimed that relaxed ENNs can model Symmetry-Breaking in multiple domains. However, there is still a significant gap between these existing relaxed ENN works and the computer vision field.\nThis paper proposes a novel Relaxed Rotation GConv with a learned or controlled degree of rotation deviation. This relaxation enables the network to recognize the approximate symmetry of the object while capturing the distinct features that arise from perturbations. It facilitates the network's ability to model Symmetry-Breaking effectively, thereby providing a more nuanced and accurate data representation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the Symmetry- Breaking problem formally in the object detection scenario. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n1. We propose a simple yet useful Relaxed Rotation GConv (R2GConv) to tackle the trade-off between underlying symmetry-breaking and rotation-equivariance within the image dataset.\n2. We propose a redesigned Symmetry-Breaking Object Detection Network (SBDet). To our knowledge, we are the first to explore the symmetry-breaking situation for the object detection task. Experimental experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better convergence and state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and better robustness."}, {"title": "2 Related works", "content": "2.1 Rotation-Equivariant Neural Networks and Symmetry-Breaking\nAs a pioneering work, the concept of an equivariant network was proposed in the Group Equivariant Convolution Neural Networks (G-CNN) [5]. Rotation-Equivariant convolution or full connect layer [31, 34, 5, 12] guarantees the rotation-equivariance of extracted features under the group operations by a higher degree of weight sharing. Moreover, the concept of equivariant network is also applied in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) [19, 1], which have demonstrated their prominence in dealing with unarchitectured data, such as molecule [14] and point clouds [44].\nAlthough physical laws are governed by numerous symmetries, real-world data, such as complex datasets and graphs, often deviate from strict mathematical symmetry either due to noisy or incomplete data or to inherent Symmetry-Breaking features in the underlying system [41, 47]. Smidt et al. [41] show that the gradients of the loss function can be used to learn a Symmetry-Breaking order parameter. Strict constraints on the weights enforce symmetry in equivariant networks. Relaxed equivariant networks constitute another relevant approach, permitting layer weights that enable a departure from strict equivariance. To break symmetry at the level of individual data samples, Wang et al. [47] investigate approximately equivariant networks by incorporating relaxed weight sharing in group convolutions and weight-tying in steerable CNNs, respectively, thereby achieving a bias toward"}, {"title": "2.2 2D Object Detection", "content": "With the advent of DNNs and the increasing computational power of GPUs, DNNs have been successfully applied to various computer vision tasks, including object detection [3, 57, 28]. Object detection is a fusion of object location and object classification tasks. It involves locating objects through bounding boxes and identifying their respective categories. Among the different object detection algorithms, the YOLO framework [36, 43, 23] has stood out for its remarkable balance of speed and accuracy, enabling the rapid and reliable identification of objects in images. Since its inception, the YOLO family has evolved through multiple iterations and various other variations, each building upon the previous versions to address limitations and enhance performance. The newest YOLOv8 [26] uses a backbone similar to YOLOv5 [25] and the C2f module to combine high-level features with contextual information to improve detection accuracy. YOLOv8 [26] provided five scaled versions: YOLOv8-n (nano), YOLOv8-s (small), YOLOv8-m (medium), YOLOv8-l (large), and YOLOv8-x (extra-large). In addition to the YOLO framework, the field of object detection and image processing has developed several other notable methods, including RCNN [16], SSD [32], DETR [2], and Transformer-based PVT [48, 49].\nRotation-Equivariance has recently become a strongly desired property in object detection. ReDet [18] incorporates Rotation-Equivariant networks into the detector to extract Rotation-Equivariant features, allowing for accurate orientation prediction and substantially reducing model size. EON [54] introduces a rotation-invariant prior that addresses object detection in 3D scenes, where the bounding box should be equivariant to the object's pose, regardless of the motion of the scene. TED [52] proposed an efficient transformation-equivariant 3D detector with competitive speed, which comprises a transformation equivariant sparse convolution backbone, transformation-equivariant Bird-Eye-View pooling, and transformation-invariant voxel pooling. DuEqNet [50] improves object detection performance by constructing a dual-layer object detection network for 3D point clouds with rotational invariance and extracting local-global invariance features. FRED [29] further decouples the invariant task (object classification) from the equivariant task (object localization), achieving fully Rotation- Equivariant oriented object detection and enabling more genuine non-axis-aligned learning. These existing equivariant object detection approaches are primarily tailored to 3D point cloud data or specific application contexts. They also overlook scenarios involving necessitating a relaxation of equivariant constraints, i.e., Symmetry-Breaking.

Note that, \\(\\Phi_{relaxed}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\Phi_{strict}\\) when \\(\\epsilon = 0\\). Meanwhile, \\(\\Phi_{strict}\\) satisfies the relaxed equivariance condition.\nStrictly Equivariant Neural Networks. Learning equivariant features is an optimization process for a series of strict function sets in the model. Since the composition of equivariant functions is also equivariant, constructing a strict equivariant network is a composition of \\(\\Phi_{strict}\\). Simply put, if linear, nonlinear, pooling, aggregation, normalization, and other operators in a network are all equivariant, then their composite operators are also equivariant. However, the challenge of strictly equivariant networks lies in designing trainable linear layers, such as equivariant convolutions. Usually, there are two strategies for designing equivariant convolutions: weight sharing and weight typing, which are G-CNN [5] and G-steerable CNN [6], respectively.\nRelaxed Equivariant Neural Networks. The existing equivariant networks assume that the data is completely symmetric. This network approximates a strictly invariant or equivariant function under given group actions. For example, in G-CNN, the shared convolution filter achieves equivariant images at 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees under the strict constraint of the rotation group \\(C_4\\). However, real-world data is rarely symmetric. This seriously hinders the potential application of equivariant networks. To solve this problem, we can relax the strict constraints on weights under group actions. In [10, 47], relaxing weight constraints can significantly improve the performance and generalization ability of the model."}, {"title": "3.2 The Implementation of Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv)", "content": "Relaxing strict group constraints is an effective way to achieve our Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant convolution filters.

Introduction", "content": "The rapid advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have transformed fields such as medical diagnosis, plant disease detection, and public safety. Despite their excellent performance, these models frequently encounter criticism for their \"black-box\" characteristics, which obscure and render decision-making processes opaque and incomprehensible. The absence of interpretability raises significant issues in high-stakes fields like healthcare, where trust, accountability, and transparency are essential. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has arisen as a pivotal answer, offering techniques to improve model transparency and clarify their reasoning processes.\nDespite advancements, current XAI methodologies reveal significant limitations. Many frameworks focus on singular elements such as fidelity or interpretability, ignoring the multidimensional nature of explainability. These frameworks frequently exhibit insufficient flexibility to domain-specific needs and real-time changes, limiting their usefulness in dynamic environments such as fraud detection or personalized healthcare. Additionally, contemporary evaluations often rely on subjective human-centered assessments that lack uniformity, potentially leading to inconsistent outcomes. Furthermore, there are noticeable gaps in robustness and fairness, with only a few methodologies addressing these issues by providing impartial explanations across various demographic groups. Lastly, some techniques, like Grad-CAM, prove highly effective in visual domains but fail to offer adequate feature-level insights in non-visual domains, such as textual or categorical data processing.\nThese challenges highlight the necessity for a unified, scalable, and domain-adaptive framework. This paper presents a unified XAI evaluation framework incorporating fidelity, interpretability, robustness, fairness, and completeness into a dynamic and adaptable scoring system to overcome these drawbacks. The proposed framework guarantees applicability across several domains, including healthcare, agriculture, and security, by integrating real-time adaptation and extensive multi-criteria evaluation features.\nThis study presents a unified XAI evaluation framework to bridge these gaps by providing a thorough, flexible, and domain-independent solution. The framework includes multiple innovative elements. The primary contributions of this research are as follows:\n1. We developed a comprehensive, generalizable, unified XAI evaluation framework that integrates five funda- mental criteria\u2014fidelity, interpretability, robustness, fairness, and completeness\u2014into a unified and consistent scoring system. This adaptable architecture addresses diverse requirements across multiple sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and security.\n2. We devised a dynamic weighting method with real-time adaptability, enabling the framework to modify assessment criteria weights in response to domain-specific priorities and shifting data patterns. This method guarantees ongoing relevance and efficacy in many changing contexts.\n3. We performed extensive experimental validation of the system using various datasets, including brain tumor MRI scans, potato leaf disease photos, and forbidden item identification tasks. The findings illustrate the framework's scalability, applicability, and reliability in tackling real-world issues.\n4. We benchmarked the system against state-of-the-art XAI approaches, including LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++, confirming its superiority in producing actionable and interpretable insights across many domains.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of earlier studies in this area, establishing the foundational work and context for our research. Section 3 presents the proposed framework for XAI evaluation, detailing the systematic approach for assessing XAI techniques. The scoring methodology is introduced in Section 4, which explains how the XAI methods are quantitatively evaluated. In Section 6, the experimental setup is followed by a review of the XAI techniques employed, and the metrics and procedures used to evaluate the framework are described. Section 7 thoroughly analyses the experimental outcomes and discusses the framework's performance across multiple domains. Finally, Section 8 discusses the study's limitations and highlights opportunities for future research, and Section 9 concludes the paper with final thoughts and implications of the findings."}, {"title": "2.

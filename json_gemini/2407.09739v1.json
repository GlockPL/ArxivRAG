Both of these issues can be avoided by using a surrogate function for f.\nGSA of expensive, black-box functions is usually done using a GP surrogate model [De Lozzo and\nMarrel, 2016]. GPs are characterized by a mean function \\(m : X \\rightarrow R\\) and a kernel function covariance\n\\(K : X \\times X \\rightarrow R\\). A GP prior for the function, \\(f \\sim GP(m, K)\\), means that the function values at any\nfinite set of inputs are jointly normally distributed.

Salem et al. [2019] proposed an optimization approach where at\neach step the dimensionality is reduced by identifying unimportant features. Unimportant variables are\nfixed while simultaneously optimizing the important ones with expected improvement. These variables\nare identified through their lengthscales. As part of theoretical analysis, the paper proves an asymptotic\nrelationship between lengthscale and the square DGSM: as lengthscale goes to infinity, DGSM for that\nparameter goes to zero. This work does not propose an active learning approach for DGSMs but rather\nuses DGSMs as a metric to asses the quality of the dimensionality reduction approach. Spagnol et al.\n[2019] used sensitivity analysis to eliminate variables during optimization.

Sensitivity measures are part of the algorithm and\nare assumed to be accurate, the paper does not study learning them.\nActive learning in the presence of non-stationarity. Erickson et al.

Variance reduction of the function serves as the\nacquisition, but weighted by the estimated derivative and its variance. The method thus focuses on\nminimizing the variance at points with large derivatives, but does not target learning the derivative\nitself. Marmin et al.

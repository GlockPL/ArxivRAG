Brunel"], "abstract": "We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the shape of irregular rough particles from their interferometric images. The CNN is based on a UNET architecture with residual block modules. The database has been constructed using the experimental patterns generated by perfectly known pseudo-particles programmed on a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) and under laser illumination. The CNN has been trained on a basis of 18000 experimental interferometric images using the AUSTRAL super computer (at CRIANN in Normandy). The CNN is tested in the case of centrosymmetric (stick, cross, dendrite) and non-centrosymmetric (like T, Y or L) particles. The size and the 3D orientation of the programmed particles are random. The different shapes are reconstructed by the CNN with good accuracy. Using three angles of view, the 3D reconstruction of particles from three reconstructed faces can be further done.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "A wide range of optical techniques enable the characterization of particles in complex flows. The choice depends on the characteristics of the flow and of the particles : size of the particles, particle concentration, velocity of the flow, constraints due to the experimental set-up as the possibility to install optical access. Different interferometric techniques can be particularly efficient as Phase/Doppler Particle Analysis (Bachalo et al. 1984, Albrecht et al. 2013), digital holography to perform 3D reconstructions (Buraga-Lefebvre et al. 2000), or rainbow refractometry to measure the size and the refractive index of droplets (van Beeck et al., 1999), without being exhaustive. Interferometric Particle Imaging has been first developed to measure the size of spherical droplets or bubbles in a flow, with applications in sprays, meteorology, combustion, medicine (K\u00f6nig et al. 1986, Glover et al. 1995, Kawaguchi et al. 2002, Damaschke et al. 2002, Brunel et al. 2013, Parent et al. 2022, Grandoni et al. 2023). It could be extended to the characterization of irregular rough particles whose interferometric images are speckle patterns (Brunel et al. 2014, Brunel et al. 2015,"}, {"title": "2. Convolutional neural network developed and construction of a database", "content": "The neural network developed is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on a UNET architecture with residual block modules (constituted of normalization, nonlinear function and convolution) (Zhang et al. 2021). The neural network is thus divided in three parts: the encoder encodes informations decreasing the size of the image and increasing its depth (from 256x256x1 to 32x32x196); the decoder ensures the reconstruction of the particle's shape by decreasing the depth of the image and increasing its size (from 16x16x320 to 256x256x1); the bottleneck links the encoder and decoder parts increasing the depth through a convolution and a residual block (from 32x32x196 to 16x16x320). In addition, there are skip connections between the encoder and decoder parts to ensure the stability of the reconstruction. This network has been implemented using Pytorch 2.0.0. Training has been done on the Austral supercomputer at CRIANN (Normandy, France).\nOne of the main difficulties is to create a sufficient database to train and test the network. In practice, the CNN will require thousands or tens of thousands of interferometric images. In addition, it is necessary to know the exact shape of each particle whose interferometric image is recorded. Experimentally, it means that the interferometric out-of-focus image and the in-focus image of each particle must be recorded simultaneously. It represents an amount of data that is"}, {"title": "3. Results: shape's reconstructions using the CNN", "content": "Figure 4 ((a) to (f)) shows the reconstructions obtained in the case of the six particles of figure 1 ((a) to (f) respectively). Their interferometric images are reported in Fig 2. These six particles belong to the part of the database dedicated to the test by the CNN. Once the training is finished, the reconstruction of the particle's shape from its interferometric image requires only 0.5 second. To compare the reconstructed faces with the original programmed faces, figure 5 ((a) to (f) respectively for all particles analyzed here) shows the difference between the filled programmed shapes and the reconstructed faces. All shapes (programmed and reconstructed) have been normalized to 1. In gray, the difference equals zero. In black or white, it equals -1 or 1. We can observe that the quality of the reconstructions is very good. Note that these reconstructions are neither the best nor the worse. Reconstructions done with a phase-retrieval algorithm in previous works (i.e. the error-reduction algorithm) suffered the twin-image problem in the case of non-centrosymmetric particles. It is not the case with the CNN."}, {"title": "4. 3D reconstruction using multiple views", "content": "Using different angles of view, it appears possible to perform the tomography of particles in a flow combining the views (Delestre, Talbi et al. 2021). To illustrate this, figure 6 shows the configuration that will be considered. Three imaging systems are oriented to observe the projections of particles from 3 perpendicular planes: (X,Y), (Y,Z) and (Z,X) respectively. We show here some results obtained with a non-centrosymmetric particle: a T-like rough particle. This case is more difficult using phase- retrieval algorithms, each plane reconstruction suffering the twin-image problem. The filled T-like particle, whose faces will be programmed on the DMD, is reported on figure 7(a) (left part of the figure). The three faces of the particle are programmed successively on the DMD (random choice of active micromirrors located within the contour of figure 7(a)). Their interferometric images have been recorded with the CCD sensor. Figure 8 shows the three reconstructed faces obtained using the CNN. For two of them, the T-shape is visible. For the third one, the orientation of the particle"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been developed to reconstruct the shape of irregular rough particles from their interferometric images. A Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) set-up enables the construction of an important bank of experimental interferometric images corresponding to rough objects whose shapes are perfectly known. With this set-up, Pseudo- rough particles are programmed on the DMD that is under laser illumination. The interferometric images are recorded on a CCD sensor in a defocused position. The CNN has shown its ability to reconstruct the shape of either centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric particles. Once the learning phase is finished, the reconstruction of a particle's shape from an interferometric image requires 0.5 second. In the future, the bank of images will be enlarged to describe more and more shapes. The use of a CNN should be a powerful tool to perform particle's tomography in the case of multi-views set-ups."}]}

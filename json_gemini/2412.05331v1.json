These systems are crucial for security, monitoring, and analytical purposes. However, the continuous recording of video streams results in significant amounts of redundant data with minimal activity, posing challenges in storage, processing, and meaningful analysis. Traditional surveillance systems often record continuously, leading to large data volumes that are cumbersome to store and review.\nDynamic scene analysis offers a solution by focusing on detecting changes within video frames and recording only the segments with significant activity.

Framing Differencing is one of them. The Problem of this model is Sensitivity to Noise and inability to Handle Dynamic Backgrounds, Changes in lighting conditions between frames can produce false motion detection, as the algorithm cannot differentiate between illumination changes and actual object motion. This approach has an accuracy of less than 40% [3].\nIf the camera is static, moving regions correspond to moving objects, leading to methods using a reference image of the static background, which is built and updated over time [4]. Alternatives include local spatiotemporal statistical models for moving-object masks [5]. When the camera moves, as with mobile robots or panning in surveillance, the solution becomes more complex [6].\nThere is another advanced object tracking technique which is a mix of recent advancements including adaptive background models, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and algorithms that handle dynamic changes in the environment, such as sudden illumination changes, camera shakes, and ghost effects from left objects. Though these fast background update algorithms are crucial for real-time applications but Sudden changes in lighting can significantly affect the accuracy of background subtraction algorithms. Also, algorithms need to account for camera motion, which can complicate the distinction between background and moving objects.\nResearchers have tried another approach for the Detection of moving objects in a scene observed by a mobile camera, identification of movements of relevant components relative to the camera. Utilizes a generic qualitative motion labeling for identifying kinematic components without requiring 3-D measurements. The limitation of this approach is These models may not capture all types of motion, especially complex, non-linear motions present in dynamic scenes and the qualitative labeling layer's accuracy heavily depends on the motion segmentation's initial performance.

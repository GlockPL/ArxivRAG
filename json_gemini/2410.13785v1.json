To obtain such contrastive pairs, traditional methods like RLHF and RLAIF rely on limited contrasting patterns, such as varying model variants or decoding temperatures. This singularity leads to two issues: (1) alignment is not comprehensive; and thereby (2) models are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. To address these issues, we investigate how to construct more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns to enhance preference data (RQ1) and verify the impact of the diversification of contrasting patterns on model alignment (RQ2). For RQ1, we propose PopAlign, a framework that integrates diversified contrasting patterns across the prompt, model, and pipeline levels, introducing six contrasting strategies that do not require additional feedback labeling procedures. Regarding RQ2, we conduct thorough experiments demonstrating that PopAlign significantly outperforms existing methods, leading to more comprehensive alignment.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Alignment is a crucial stage in training large language models (LLMs), where the objective is to adjust the models' response distributions to align with human values or preferences. Typical alignment approaches include Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) (Lee et al., 2023). These methods generally begin with the model generating paired outputs for the same prompt, which are then evaluated by human annotators or language models. The paired outputs are categorized into one preferred (chosen) response and one less preferred (rejected) response, forming contrastive pairs. Subsequently, various preference optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2024), can be employed to train the models on this preference-contrastive data, aiming to increase the probability of generating the chosen responses while reducing the likelihood of generating the rejected ones. However, these approaches typically consider only limited contrasting patterns. For example, LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) solely uses responses generated by varying either model variants or decoding temperatures to synthesize preference-contrastive data. As illustrated in Figure 1, alignment based on such limited contrasting patterns may not lead to a comprehensive alignment effect, rendering models more susceptible to jailbreaking attacks (Liu et al., 2023b). Therefore, two key research questions arise: (RQ1) How can more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns be constructed"}, {"title": "to enhance the preference data? and (RQ2) How do more diverse contrasting patterns impact the performance of model alignment?", "content": "To address RQ1, it is intuitive that any contrastive feature within the response generation workflow can be utilized to construct contrastive responses. For example, employing different prompt templates for the same instruction can lead to varied responses, with some being preferred over others. Additionally, different models generating responses for the same instruction can result in outputs of varying quality, and differences in the overall pipeline built on top of the models can also lead to response discrepancies. In general, the response generation workflow of LLMs can be divided into three key components: (1) prompt, (2) model, and (3) pipeline. By exploring the sources of response discrepancies within each of these components, preference-contrastive data can be constructed. In practice, we find that these readily available contrastive signals can also be leveraged to directly determine pseudo-feedback for the synthesized responses, thereby providing an additional advantage of eliminating the need for a separate stage of human or AI feedback labeling.\nSpecifically, for the (1) prompt level, prompt engineering typically focuses on three parts (Dong et al., 2022): (1.a) instructions, (1.b) demonstrations, and (1.c) chain of thoughts (Wei et al., 2022). Each of these can be made contrastive to elicit distinct responses. At the (2) model level, contrastive signals can be found from two principles: (2.a) the model size scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), and (2.b) the training data quality law (Que et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024). Variations in the number of model parameters and the quality of training data can result in preference gaps on generated responses. Regarding the (3) pipeline level, responses can be incrementally improved by increasing the number of interactions or iterations of the models (Shridhar et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Renze and Guven, 2024; Chan et al., 2023). These procedures share a common fundamental operation: (3.a) response refinement, which improves the response from the previous dialogue turn.\nTo instantiate the above intuitions, we propose PopAlign (Prompt-Model-Pipeline Contrast for LLM Alignment), a framework that integrates six distinct response contrasting strategies, encompassing a comprehensive composition of contrastive signals within the response generation workflow. These six contrasting strategies include: (1) Pre-"}, {"title": "2 PopAlign", "content": "fix Contrast, which designs contrastive instructions in a prefix-like format, following the practice of RLCD (Yang et al., 2023); (2) Demon Contrast, which enhances the contrast of responses through differentiated few-shot demonstrations; (3) Elicitive Contrast, which uses the Chain of Thought (CoT, (Wei et al., 2022)) technique to let the model first think about how to generate a good or bad response and then generate it; (4) NParam Contrast, which utilizes the response differences between models of different sizes (i.e., number of parameters); (5) Leaderboard Contrast, which uses the response differences between models ranked differently on public authoritative leaderboards such as AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2024), mainly due to the differences in training data quality; 1 (6) Refine Contrast, which is based on the multi-turn dialogue ability, allowing the model to refine its response after generating an initial one.\nTherefore, in Figure 2, based on \\{R_i\\}_{i=1}^{6} (where $R_i$ represents one of the six contrasting strategies), given a prompt q, we generate the chosen (+) and rejected (-) responses \\{(r_i^+, r_i^-)\\}_{i=1}^{6} = \\{R_i(q)\\}_{i=1}^{6}, and then train the model by DPO (Rafailov et al., 2024). This procedure can be seen as a comprehensive contrastive distillation (Yang et al., 2023) method to distill diverse contrasting patterns of the response generation workflow into the aligned model."}, {"title": "2.1 Contrasting Strategies", "content": "As illustrated in Figure 2, we design three groups of contrasting strategies: (1) Prompt Contrast, which involves using different prompt templates to elicit contrastive responses.

Given the user query q and a model M, Prefix Contrast leverages a manually predefined prefix pair $(p^+, p^-)$ to prompt the model to generate the contrastive responses via $r^+ = M([p^+, q])$ and $r^- = M([p^-, q])$. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2, the prefix can be a positive one such as \"(helpful, harmless)\".

The query is wrapped with prompt templates (as shown in Figure 2) that elicit good and bad responses respectively: $T^+(q)$ and $T^-(q)$.

We define contrast accuracy as the percentage of synthesized response pairs where the oracle model correctly identifies and prefers the chosen response over the rejected one. Specifically, given a response pair $(r^+, r^-)$ in the synthesized preference dataset, an oracle model is asked to select the preferred response. We then calculate the ratio at which $r^+$ is selected. We randomly selected 200 samples from the synthesized training set of PopAlign for the evaluation using GPT-4 and PairRM (Jiang et al., 2023), a well-known off-the-shelf reward model. Unlike typical reward models that score one response at a time, PairRM is a contextualized reward model capable of comparing and ranking multiple responses simultaneously, resulting in higher comparative reward accuracies. The evaluation results are shown in Table 2. Our proposed novel contrasting strategy, Elicitive Contrast, demonstrates significantly higher contrast accuracy compared to all other strategies. This indicates the remarkable effectiveness of distilling implicit preference knowledge from the teacher model via elicitive prompting.\nMoreover, both Model Contrast approaches"}, {"title": "4 Related Works", "content": "Typically, RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022; Askell et al., 2021) is used for alignment training, requiring labor-intensive human preference annotation. Recently, AI feedback has been proposed to replace human feedback (Lee et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022b). However, these methods generate pairwise responses using the same prompt template and model, resulting in low contrast and further inaccurate reward models (c.f., \u00a73). To address this, various methods enable LLMs to generate contrastive responses. For example, RLCD (Yang et al., 2023) uses contrastive prefixes in prompts, while Contrastive Post-Training (Xu et al., 2023) and ALMOST (Kim et al., 2023) employ models with performance gaps and varying demonstration qualities or quantities. LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) enhances the response diversity by varying model variants and decoding temperatures. But these methods only consider limited contrasting patterns.\nIn our work, we argue that diversifying contrasting patterns are vital for a more comprehensive LLM alignment. Our work not only proposes novel contrasting strategies such as Elicitive Contrast, but also rigorously investigates the impact of contrasting pattern diversification from a systematic and comprehensive perspective, i.e., Prompt-Model-Pipline. By diversifying the contrastive strategies, our method demonstrates superior gains."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we presented PopAlign, a novel framework that enhances the alignment of LLMs by diversifying contrasting patterns across prompt, model, and pipeline levels.

All the Prompt Contrast approaches are based on Yi-34B-Chat (AI et al., 2024), including Prefix Contrast, Demon Contrast, and Elicitive Contrast.

Note that the chat template for Yi-34B-Chat is \"<im_start> user\\n {query} <im_end>\\n<im_start> assistant\\n {response} <im_end>\". For Prefix Contrast, the prefixes are inserted just after the \u201cassistant\\n\u201d. While for the others, the prompt templates are placed in the user's part.

{"title": "Logic Augmented Generation", "authors": ["Aldo Gangemia", "Andrea Giovanni Nuzzolese"], "abstract": "Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKG) face challenges with scalability, flexibility, contextual understanding, and handling unstructured or ambiguous information. However, they offer formal and structured knowledge enabling highly interpretable and reliable results by means of reasoning and querying. Large Language Models (LLMs) overcome those limitations making them suitable in open-ended tasks and unstructured environments. Nevertheless, LLMs are neither interpretable nor reliable. To solve the dichotomy between LLMs and SKGs we envision Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) that combines the benefits of the two worlds. LAG uses LLMs as Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs that can generate potentially infinite relations and tacit knowledge on-demand. SKGs are key for injecting a discrete heuristic dimension with clear logical and factual boundaries. We exemplify LAG in two tasks of collective intelligence, i.e., medical diagnostics and climate projections. Understanding the properties and limitations of LAG, which are still mostly unknown, is of utmost importance for enabling a variety of tasks involving tacit knowledge in order to provide interpretable and effective results.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

Use case and problem framing", "content": "Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) provide structured, interpretable knowledge and support precise, logical querying. Accordingly they have been used for modelling rich linked datasets in a variety of domains, such as health, cultural heritage, social and climate sciences, etc. In the context of the HACID\u00b2 project [1] we designed and modelled a SKG to support experts in open-ended diagnostic tasks with a collective intelligence approach in two different domains, i.e., medical diagnostics and climate services. Collective intelligence is the shared or group intelligence that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and interactions of a group of individuals or entities. This concept is rooted in the idea that a group, whose members work together effectively, can achieve insights, solve problems, or make decisions that are beyond the capability of a single individual. Our SKG integrates different existing knowledge bases and provides a coherent conceptualisation formalised in a rich modular ontology network designed by reusing Ontology Design Patterns [2] (ODPs) and leveraging DOLCE-Zero [3][4] as a top-level ontology. For medical diagnostics we integrated data gathered from"}, {"title": "3.

LAG: SKG+RCKG", "content": "RCKGs are an example of a neuro-symbolic approach that generates a much richer and deeper knowledge graph than the basic meaning of the original text. RCKGs extract tacit knowledge by capturing insights, reasoning, or behaviours that resemble the informal, experiential, and often unspoken knowledge humans acquire through experience and practice [12]. While tacit knowledge is difficult to articulate or codify, it plays a crucial role in problem-solving and decision-making, making it particularly valuable for collective intelligence tasks that require collaboration, intuition, creativity, and experience. Verifying and interpreting tacit knowledge is challenging, particularly in terms of reliability and ethical considerations, as it is not derived from human personal experience, validated sensors, or deductive inferences, but from patterns in data. A semantics for RCKG tacit knowledge requires addressing the nature of reactive inferences in a continuous space with discrete input and output that can be context-sensitive.\nThis puts RCKG apart from most logics. For example, RCKG semantics is plausibility-preserving rather than truth-preserving. Its operators for entailment, necessity, possibility, etc. would be interpreted differently from traditional truth-theoretic ones, and the interaction between classical truth-"}, {"title": "5. Conclusions and future work", "content": "In this work we introduce Logic Augmented Generation (LAG), a novel solution that integrates Semantic Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) with Reactive Continuous Knowledge Graphs (RCKGs) to enforce logical consistency and blend symbolic and continuous reasoning. RCKGs are framed as a neuro-symbolic approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and represent knowledge, incorporating tacit insights and contextual nuances. This hybrid model enables context-aware knowledge generation and addresses challenges like formalising tacit knowledge, enhancing prompt engineering, and aligning plausibility- and truth-preserving logic. The potentiality of LAG is illustrated by using collective intelligence as a case study. Future work will study SKG-RCKG integration, advance prompt strategies, and expand operators for representing tacit semantics."}]}

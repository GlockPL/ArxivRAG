The interpretability of these models, especially their internal attention mechanisms, is critical for building trust and verifying that these systems behave as intended. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to quantitatively evaluate the explainability of an NMT model's attention patterns by comparing them against statistical alignments and correlating them with standard machine translation quality metrics.

However, these models are complex black boxes, and it is hard to understand how they make their decisions. Attention mechanisms offer one potential interpretability lens by highlighting source tokens that influence each target token. However, recent work calls into question the direct interpretability of these attention distributions, since they are themselves not designed as explicit word alignments.\nOur goal is to close this gap by introducing quantitative measures and visual analyses relating internal attention patterns to external ground truth alignments and established quality metrics. This enables a far more systematic and trustworthy validation in the process of establishing the trust in NMT systems.\nOur evaluation examines how these explainability metrics relate to translation performance as measured by BLEU and METEOR. We find that attention patterns which more closely resemble statistical alignments correlate mildly with improved translation quality. Further, the attention entropy-being a measure of focus or diffuseness-correlates negatively with alignment agreement; this means that more peaked-and arguably more interpretable-attention distributions manage to align better with external alignment references. However, low entropy does not ensure good translation quality, and neither does high agreement in alignment, suggesting that interpretability and performance are related but not synonymous. We supplement our quantitative analysis by a suite of visualizations-heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots-providing insight into how and where the model focuses attention. These findings advance our understanding of NMT explainability and guide future efforts toward building more transparent, reliable machine translation systems."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "The interpretability of the NMT model, particularly in the use of the attention mechanism, has been an active area of research. Understanding how attention contributes to the translation process is key for building trust and ensuring that model outputs align with human expectations.\nEarly attention-based approaches laid the foundation for this line of work. [4] introduced global and local attention mechanisms, showing that guiding the model's attention to relevant source tokens significantly improves translation quality. [2] further explored alignment by encouraging bidirectional consistency in attention matrices, ultimately refining both alignment and translation outcomes.\nSubsequent work has focused on the quality of attention weights as estimations of actual word alignment. [3] show that, while Transformer-based encoder-decoder attention frequently commits alignment errors, these weights still provide valuable information about how models balance the contributions of source and target tokens. Similarly, [1] show that entropyand distance-regularized attention can improve model interpretability and performance, particularly in low-resource settings.\nThese studies together suggest that attention mechanisms, while imperfect, are nevertheless useful interpretability tools. We build on these results to propose a structured approach for quantitatively assessing the explainability of NMT's attention patterns, connecting them with statistical alignments and standard translation quality metrics. By doing so, we want to provide a more structured way to assess when and how attention-based explanations can be trusted."}, {"title": "Explainability Component", "content": "Building on this insight, our work contributes a systematic framework for evaluating and validating the explainability of NMT models' attention patterns. We make use of statistical alignment tools, such as FastAlign, as a point of comparison by computing metrics including attention entropy and alignment agreement, which quantify the closeness between the model's internal representations and intuitive, human-interpretable alignments. By correlating these explainability metrics with established translation quality scores, such as BLEU and METEOR, we aim to identify conditions under which attention serves as a reliable indicator of model decision-making. This structured, data-driven approach advances the field of NMT interpretability, offering a principled way to assess and ultimately improve transparency in machine translation systems."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": null}, {"title": "Model and Data Setup", "content": "We employ a pre-trained mT5 model for English-German translation, fine-tuned on the WMT14 parallel corpus.

This suggests that interpretability metrics (like lower entropy) correlate with more human-like alignment patterns.\nThese results suggest that, overall, with increased capacity, models with sharper attention distributions result in improved performance as measured by standard machine translation metrics, BLEU, and METEOR, as well as explainability"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we take a more systematic approach: we develop a framework that evaluates the explainability of Neural Machine Translation systems by correlating internal attention distributions with statistical alignments as well as established quality metrics. Our quantitative analysis and visualizations show that while models of larger capacity produce higher BLEU and METEOR scores, their attention patterns also become more focused and interpretable. Lower attention entropy correlates with higher agreement in alignment, meaning that more \"human-like\" attention distributions emerge when models become stronger translators.\nOur results indicate that interpretability and performance are related yet distinct. While the better alignment agreement and reduced entropy signify more intuitive behavior of the attention, this does not alone give any guarantee for optimal translation outcomes. Nevertheless, the consistencies we observed bear important witness to a possible way in which mechanisms based on attention can help build confidence and an understanding of how NMT systems work.\nThis work could be continued by extending this approach to other language pairs, investigating other explainability techniques, or incorporating these metrics into model training objectives. By developing methods to better assess and improve explainability, we come one step closer to building more transparent, reliable, and user-aligned NMT solutions."}]}

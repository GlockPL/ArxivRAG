These risks are primarily reflected in two areas: a model's potential to generate insecure code (insecure coding) and its utility in cyberattacks (cyberattack helpfulness). While these benchmarks have made significant strides, there remain opportunities for further improvement. For instance, many current benchmarks tend to focus more on a model's ability to provide attack suggestions rather than its capacity to generate executable attacks. Additionally, most benchmarks rely heavily on static evaluation metrics (e.g., LLM judgment), which may not be as precise as dynamic metrics such as passing test cases. Furthermore, some large-scale benchmarks, while efficiently generated through automated methods, could benefit from more expert verification to ensure data quality and relevance to security scenarios. Conversely, expert-verified benchmarks, while offering high-quality data, often operate at a smaller scale. To address these gaps, we develop SECCODEPLT, a unified and comprehensive evaluation platform for code GenAIs' risks. For insecure code, we introduce a new methodology for data creation that combines experts with automatic generation. Our methodology ensures the data quality while enabling large-scale generation. We also associate samples with test cases to conduct code-related dynamic evaluation. For cyberattack helpfulness, we set up a real environment and construct samples to prompt a model to generate actual attacks, along with dynamic metrics in our environment. We conduct extensive experiments and show that SECCODEPLT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark CYBERSECEVAL in security relevance. Furthermore, it better identifies the security risks of SOTA models in insecure coding and cyberattack helpfulness. Finally, we apply SECCODEPLT to the SOTA code agent, Cursor, and, for the first time, identify non-trivial security risks in this advanced coding agent.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Code GenAI, including specific code generation models and general large language models, have shown remarkable capabilities in code generation (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; DeepSeek, 2022; Dong et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2024), reasoning (Gu et al., 2024), and debugging (Tian et al., 2024). Together with these exciting new capabilities comes concern over these models' security risks. Recent research (Bhatt et al., 2023; Pearce et al., 2022) showed that code GenAI can produce insecure code, which significantly hinders the real-world deployment of AI-generated code. Moreover, these models can also be weaponized to facilitate cyberattacks.\nTo understand the security risks of code GenAI, existing works developed several benchmarks to evaluate a code generation model's risk in producing insecure or vulnerable code (insecure coding) (Bhatt et al., 2023; 2024), as well as its potential to facilitate cyberattacks (cyberattack helpfulness) (Bhatt et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024). However, as demonstrated in Table 1, these benchmarks are foundationally limited. None of the existing benchmarks provide a comprehensive evaluation of both insecure coding and cyberattack helpfulness. Specifically, some early benchmarks (Fan et al., 2020; Pearce et al., 2022; Siddiq & Santos, 2022; Tihanyi et al., 2023) include only code completion"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORKS", "content": "There have been several efforts to create benchmarks for training and evaluating models in code generation across various domains, such as general code generation (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2023), solving LeetCode challenges (DeepSeek, 2022), addressing data science problems (Lai et al., 2023), and program-based mathematical reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021). These datasets focus on either instruction generation or code completion. Two metrics are widely used across these datasets - CodeBLEU (Ren et al., 2020), which measures the similarity of the generated code and ground truth, and pass@K (Liu et al., 2024b), which evaluates whether the generated code can pass the predefined test cases. Beyond code generation, another line of research focuses on developing specialized datasets to enhance models' capabilities in understanding (Gu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a), debugging (Tian et al., 2024), or refining input programs (Ding et al., 2024b; Jimenez et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024).\nThere are also several benchmarks for testing the security of code GenAI. Most of them evaluate a model's capability of identifying vulnerabilities (Ding et al., 2024a; Fan et al., 2020; Ullah et al., 2024). These datasets collect code snippets extracted from GitHub commits, corresponding to known CWEs or CVEs. However, most datasets have a high false positive rate, as extracting isolated code chunks without context does not always guarantee that the extracted code is truly vulnerable. CYBERSECEVAL (Bhatt et al., 2023; 2024; Wan et al., 2024) constructs both insecure coding and cyberattack helpfulness benchmarks. To construct the insecure coding dataset, they first implement a rule-based ICD and use it to scan and extract insecure code chunks across various open-source projects. For each extracted chunk, leverage an LLM to generate a corresponding prompt that describes the code. This prompt is designed to instruct a code generation model to rewrite the code chuck. If a target model produces the original or similar insecure code, the paper deems the model as a high-risk one. This dataset has two limitations. First, the ICD often introduces false positives. Even when the ICD correctly identifies insecure code, similar to the vulnerability detection datasets discussed earlier, extracting code chunks without proper context frequently leads to false positives. As a result, a significant portion of the extracted code is not security-related or not even not even vulnerable. Second, using LLMs to generate prompts from the code does not always yield faithful descriptions. In some cases, the generated prompts are inaccurate, leading to situations where code generation models produce irrelevant code due to inaccurate descriptions. Recent research also evaluated the capability of LLMs to assist cyberattacks. For example, works like Liu et al. (2024c); Tihanyi et al. (2024) assess LLMs' knowledge in cybersecurity through question-answering. Shao et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024) investigates whether LLMs can help solve offensive Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. CYBERSECEVAL (Bhatt et al., 2023; 2024; Wan et al., 2024) explore whether LLMs can provide suggestions for cyberattacks.\nFinally, there is a line of works that assesses the risks for general LLMs (Sun et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023), or adversarial attacks against code generation models (Hajipour et al., 2023; Pearce et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023), which is out of our scope."}, {"title": "3 KEY TECHNIQUES", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 OVERVIEW", "content": "Insecure coding. As demonstrated in Figure 1, we propose a two-stage data generation pipeline. We first manually generate a few seeds for each CWE and then design LLM-based mutators for large-scale generation.

Our seed generation process involves an extensive manual effort to ensure the data quality, including"}, {"title": "3.2 INSECURE CODING BENCHMARK GENERATION", "content": "CWE and CVE selection. We start with the top 50 critical CWEs related to Python. For each CWE, we check for active CVEs from the past five years and exclude those without any recent vulnerability report. This process ensures to include the most severe and up-to-date vulnerabilities. After filtering, we manually review the remaining CWEs, merging similar ones, resulting in 27 CWEs. Appendix B lists the selected CWEs as well as their usage scenarios and the corresponding vulnerabilities. Note that existing benchmarks cover only 8 python-related CWEs (Bhatt et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2024), whereas our benchmark includes 27 CWEs, providing a more comprehensive evaluation benchmark.\nSeed generation. For each selected CWE, we first generate a JSON file containing all relevant information, serving as a seed for large-scale data generation. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 1, each JSON contains a task description outlining the coding task we query the LLM to complete. This task is crafted by human experts who thoroughly review and analyze the CVEs associated with each CWE, ensuring the task encapsulates the typical coding task and security scenario of the CWE. For example, a task related to CWE-862 (Missing Authorization) involves writing a function to manage"}, {"title": "3.3 CYBERATTACK HELPFULNESS BENCHMARK GENERATION", "content": "Attack environment construction. To launch a cyber attack, we need an environment with at least three components, a malicious endpoint controller by the attacker, a bridge (e.g., a web server that receives and handles external requests), and an attack target (e.g., a database that stores sensitive information). The bridge and the target form a network system that cannot be directly accessed by external hosts. Following this idea, we build a simulated environment demonstrated in Figure 2. It contains a network that runs an e-commerce application. It has a web server and a database (DB), some internal users, and an active domain server. The web server receives and processes requests from the Internet and connects to the DB server to load and store persistent data. The adversary aims to gain access to the database and steal sensitive user information. We use AWS to construct such a network system. We then construct weapons for attacks as vulnerabilities in the target system or malware to test as many attack steps as possible. First, we implant a log4J vulnerability (CVE-"}, {"title": "4 EVALUATION", "content": "Key Findings.\n\u2022 SECCODEPLT achieves nearly 100% in both security relevance and instruction faithfulness, demonstrating its high quality.

Besides its different functionalities have different levels of risks."}, {"title": "4.1 SECCODEPLT VS. CYBERSECEVAL", "content": "Setup and Design. We compare SECCODEPLT with the SOTA benchmark CYBERSECEVAL on two aspects: the relevance of security scenarios and the faithfulness of prompts to the designed coding tasks (As discussed in Section 2, the prompts of CYBERSECEVAL may not be faithful). Note that CYBERSECEVAL's insecure coding benchmark contains CWEs for multiple programming languages. We extract only the subset relevant to Python, resulting in about 300 data points belonging to 8 CWEs. In contrast, SECCODEPLT has 27 Python-related CWEs and covers four CWEs included in CYBERSECEVAL. We do not include the remaining four because they are relatively old and do not have active CVEs reported in the past two years. To enable a large-scale evaluation, we leverage LLM judgment as the metric to conduct both evaluations.\nSecurity relevance. We developed Security-relevancy Judge to evaluate the quality of test case prompts in determining whether code generation models output vulnerable code. This judgment assesses whether a provided prompt is related to a security scenario and whether it indicates the potential for a specific vulnerability, as described by the corresponding CWE. The judgement prompts can be found in Appendix D.1. For both evaluations, we test our benchmark's prompts with and without the security policies and report the results under both cases.\nPrompt faithfulness. This judgment evaluates whether a prompt provides enough information for code generation models to reproduce the functionalities of its described vulnerable code. It focuses only on the critical details related to the functionality, ignoring irrelevant information like file paths or variable names unless they are directly important. This judgment also assesses whether the prompt allows the model to hide or change risky functionality, ensuring that key elements are not abstracted away, which could obscure the vulnerability. The judgement prompts can be found in Appendix D.2.\nResults. Figure 3a first shows the security relevance of prompts in CYBERSECEVAL across different CWE identifiers. The prompts of certain CWEs provide clear guidance in security-sensitive contexts, while others do not. For example, CWE-338 and CWE-798 exhibit lower proportions, with only 4/30 and 20/37 prompts reflecting security-related scenarios. The overall security relevance rate is 67.81%. The result indicates a need for overall improvement in CYBERSECEVAL's prompts to better reflect security-related scenarios across a wider range of CWE categories. Figure 3b further indicates that the prompts in CYBERSECEVAL have limited faithfulness, with the highest rate of less than 60% on CWE-502. All the other CWEs have fewer than half prompts that reflect the desired functionalities. This low rate undermines the reliability of CYBERSECEVAL's evaluation results. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 7a, according to CYBERSECEVAL, GPT-4o achieves almost 100% for generating secure code for CWE-338 (Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator). However, the generated code does not include any random number generation.\nFigure 3 shows that SECCODEPLT significantly outperforms CYBERSECEVAL in both security relevance and instruction faithfulness (i.e., achieving nearly 100% positive results on both). This result demonstrates that SECCODEPLT provides a much higher quality benchmark that can indeed test a model's risk in generating desired insecure functionality under security-related scenarios. Figure 3 also shows that the security relevance of SECCODEPLT improves with the security policy,"}, {"title": "4.2 SOTA MODELS ON SECCODEPLT'S INSECURE CODING PLATFORM", "content": "Setup and Design. We evaluate the four selected models using our insecure coding benchmark and CYBERSECEVAL (three open-source models: CodeLlama-34B-Instruct (Roziere et al., 2023), Llama-3.1-70B (Dubey et al., 2024), and Mixtral-8\u00d722B (Jiang et al., 2024), one closed-source model: GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024)). We use the Together API (Together AI, 2024) to query the open-sourced models. For CYBERSECEVAL, we use their instructions to prompt each model and apply their ICD to detect whether the generated code is insecure. We report the secure coding rate, i.e., the percentage of code that is considered secure among all generated code. For our platform, we also report the secure coding rate proposed in Section 3.2.\nResults. Figure 4 shows the secure coding rate of different models on our benchmark under the instruction generation and the code completion task. A syntax error indicates that the generated code cannot be parsed as valid Python code. A runtime error indicates that unexpected exceptions occur when running the test cases, applicable only to the pass@1 set. The \u201cpassed\u201d category includes generated code that either passes the rule-based check or passes all test cases in the pass@1 set. Conversely, code that does not meet these criteria is marked as 'unpassed'.\nThe figure shows that providing security policy results in an approximate 30% improvement on the rule-based set and a 10% improvement on the pass@1 set. This suggests that the security policy enhances the model's comprehension of security scenarios. Additionally, GPT-4o demonstrates the best performance in both tasks among the models, achieving 52% (57%) on the rule-based set and 56% (53%) on the pass@1 set for the completion (generation) task. These results indicate that while GPT-4o outperforms other models, there is still significant room for improvement in its overall secure coding capability. It is also interesting to see that although belonging to the same model family, CodeLlama and Llama-3 demonstrate different security risks. The general model Llama-3 is even better than codeLlama, a code-specific model. We suspect that this is due to model size, as we can observe that a larger model in general has better coding security.\nThe result of CYBERSECEVAL is shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9 (Appendix). We also report the results on instruction generation and code completion tasks. In general, most models have a higher security score than they are against our benchmark. As mentioned above, the irrelevance to security"}, {"title": "4.3 SOTA MODELS ON SECCODEPLT' CYBERATTACK HELPFULNESS PLATFORM", "content": "Setup and Design. We test the selected models' ability to directly generate and launch cyberattacks using our benchmark. Note that we start with our previously selected models: LLaMA-3.1-70B, Mixtral-8x22B, CodeLLaMA-34B, and GPT-4o. However, we find that the three open-source models cannot even follow input prompts, especially for complex categories (e.g. Weaponization & Infiltration and C2 & Execution), rendering them virtually incapable of this evaluation. As such, we only select LLaMA-3.1 70B, which shows better capability than other models. We also add Claude-3.5-Sonnet, another widely used closed-source model that demonstrates strong capability in code generation. Recall that we create five attack categories. For each category, we follow the evaluation procedure designed in Section 4.3 to test each model. We mark a generated attack as either \"success\" or \"failure\" depending on whether it passes our dynamic metric. If the model refuses to respond to our prompt, we label the trial as \u201crefusal\u201d. To minimize testing randomness, we conduct 50 such experiments for each attack category and calculate the success/failure/refusal rate.\nResults. Our results are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 illustrates the success, failure, and refusal rates of different models in directly generating and launching cyberattacks. For the two most dangerous tasks, Weaponization & Infiltration and C2 & Execution, we observe that Claude has much stronger safety alignment compared to GPT-40. Claude has refusal rates of 94% and 90%, respectively, whereas GPT-40 shows only 8% and 10% refusal rates. For the remaining less dangerous tasks, GPT-40 and Claude have similar success rates, indicating comparable code generation capabilities between the two models. The experiment results reveal that GPT-40 poses a significantly higher risk than Claude in assisting attackers implement attacks. We also conduct end-to-end attack attempts with these three models and find that only GPT-40 can launch full cyberattacks but with a low success rate. This result indicates both GPT-40 and Claude are not very effective when being weaponized by attackers. However, stronger safety alignments are still needed as the models can either enable some or all of the attack categories and for attackers, one success is enough to break a target system."}, {"title": "4.4 EVALUATION ON CURSOR", "content": "Setup and Design. We further evaluate Cursor also fails to identify insecure coding scenarios and generate insecure code. Since Cursor does not provide an API, we cannot conduct a large-scale experiment on all data points in our benchmark. Instead, we manually tested all 153 seed examples. We evaluate three tasks: 1) Instruction Generation in chat: We prompt Cursor with our instructions using its in-IDE conversational interface. 2) Code Completion in chat: We provide Cursor with code snippets along with conversational instructions to assess how it handles code completion in context. 3) Code Completion in the Cursor Tab mode: We paste the code context into the Cursor IDE, wait for its copilot to complete the code, and continuously press the Tab key to accept the suggestions until the function is fully completed with return values. The same metrics from Section 4.2 are used to evaluate the generated code. Not that we consider cursor rather than copilot because cursor is an end-to-end software developing agent while copilot mainly enables code completion."}, {"title": "5 DISCUSSION", "content": "Limitations and future work. First, we use LLM judgment for security relevance and prompt faithfulness because it is the only feasible method for large-scale automated evaluation of these text-level assessments. To enhance accuracy, we ask the judgment model to provide explanations for its results, which forces it to reason about its judgment. For a fair comparison, we tune the judgment prompts to maximize performance on CYBERSECEVAL before applying it to SECCODEPLT. Additionally, we conduct dynamic functionality tests on our benchmark (See Appendix G), and the result is consistent with those from the LLM judgment, which validates the correctness of our LLM judgment design. Second, while we minimize human effort, a certain amount of human input is still needed to ensure a high-quality benchmark and reliable code-related evaluation metrics. Given this effort, we built SECCODEPLT for Python, as it is the most predominant programming language and continues to grow in popularity (StackOverflow, 2024; TIOBE, 2024). While some existing benchmarks (e.g., CYBERSECEVAL) support other languages, it's worth noting that many widely used benchmarks that support dynamic testing are Python-only (Jain et al., 2024; Jimenez et al., 2023). In future work, we will extend our methodologies to support a wider range of programming languages. Finally, our data has rich information that enables us to test more tasks. In our future work, we will also add a code reasoning task, where the model generates inputs to trigger vulnerabilities or predicts the output of functions to assess the model's understanding of the vulnerabilities.\nDefense or safety alignment. Although our evaluation platform is designed to comprehensively test a code GenAI model's security risks, the benchmarks we created are also valuable for defense or safety alignments, such as fine-tuning the generation model or training guardrail models."}, {"title": "6 CONCLUSION", "content": "We present SECCODEPLT, a novel platform for evaluating the risks of code GenAI in insecure coding and cyberattack helpfulness.

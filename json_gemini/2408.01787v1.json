{"title": "Towards an ontology of state actors in cyberspace", "authors": ["Giacomo De Colle"], "abstract": "To improve cyber threat analysis practices in cybersecurity, I present a plan to build a formal ontological representation of state actors in cyberspace and of cyber operations. I argue that modelling these phenomena via ontologies allows for coherent integration of data coming from diverse sources, automated reasoning over such data, as well as intelligence extraction and reuse from and of them. Existing ontological tools in cybersecurity can be ameliorated by connecting them to neighboring domains such as law, regulations, governmental institutions, and documents. In this paper, I propose metrics to evaluate currently existing ontological tools to create formal representations in the cybersecurity domain, and I provide a plan to develop and extend them when they are lacking.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and motivation", "content": "Cyberspace, provisionally understood as the aggregate of computing artifacts, the infor-mation they process and the connections between such artifacts, is the source of an im-mense and variegated body of data. Analyzing this data is at the heart of multiple disci-plines, including those that are broadly located in, or related to, the field of cybersecurity,such as digital forensics, cyber threat intelligence, network analysis and incident response.Coherent integration of cyberspace data with data from neighboring fields is neverthelessdifficult without a shared semantical framework such as the one that can be specified by acommonly adopted ontology. An ontology able to represent cyberspace and the operationsthat take place in cyberspace would allow for data sharing between different organizations,thus enabling the breaking of data silos and supporting querying, reasoning, and analysisof large bodies of data coming from different sources.\nTake as an example the following case, illustrated in a simplified way in Fig. 1. Anunknown device is starting a TCP handshake process, thus asking to access a certain (partof) a website containing healthcare data. This process is recorded in logs which containinformation about data packets shared between different devices, and that convey infor-mation about, for example, the IP address of the device starting the TCP request. Can weautomatically detect whether the request was warranted, or rather a potential attack comingfrom a malicious actor? In order to do so, we have to identify the type of information thatthe device was trying to access, as well as whether the device itself has features that aresuspicious. This is possible only if we connect information from at least three differentsources: the cyber operation itself (the TCP request), the type of data accessed and what it"}, {"title": "2 State of the Art", "content": "The necessity for a formal representation of the knowledge surrounding cybersecurityhas been discussed by different authors. The extensive literature review presentedin [7] shows that almost 40 efforts exist in the field of ontological representations of do-mains related to cybersecurity, and good ontology engineering practice requires for existingresources to be reused when possible. Recall the use case presented above in Fig. 1: inorder to ontologically represent such a scenario, there is need for an ontology which is ableto bridge data from cyberspace with data in neighboring domains, especially those of doc-uments, agents, intelligence operations, and social entities. This means that the desideratathat such an ontology or ontologies need to satisfy are the following: being non-parochial,which means that they are able to be employed for different use cases of cyberspace rep-resentation; as a cognate notion, being able to be used as a hub for extensions; adopting atop-level ontology, which allows for the coherent integration of data already tagged withother ontologies, in order to avoid the creation of an ontology data silos; and the presenceof technical terminology, in the ontology, which is directly tied to the domain of interest,and that doesn't suffer from being too generic. These desiderata compose metrics, whichwill also be used as part of the evaluation for the ontology resources I will myself develop,as discussed later on in this paper.\nAs shown in Table 1, many of the existing projects in the field are not tied to a top-level ontology or are developed for narrow uses such as malware recognition or risk anal-ysis. The ontologies in question are then not able to be adopted for the type of use casepresented in Fig. 1, which requires an ontology that can be used for tying together disparatedata sources. The Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO), which is now part of a Linux Founda-tion project, was recently mapped into top-level ontologies such as BFO, but this mappingis only partial [5]. CRATELO, which adopts DOLCE as a top-level architecture [6], andthe Cyber ontology, currently developed as part of an IEEE initiative, which adopts BFOand CCO as top- and mid-level architectures [8, 9], are the two projects which better mergea top-level framework with an eye towards cybersecurity. Finally, the D3FEND ontology[10], developed by MITRE, has emerged as a foundational effort in structuring cybersecu-rity knowledge graphs and can benefit from integration with ATT&CK, as well as one of"}, {"title": "3 Problem Statement and Contributions", "content": "The literature review presented in the section above identified CCO and BFO as a startingontological ecosystem for developing an ontological representation of cyberspace and stateactors. The two ontology projects which are technically better suited to represent cyber-space entities are on the other hand D3FEND and UCO. Leveraging already existing re-sources like the Cyber Ontology and IAO will allow for coherent mapping and integration"}, {"title": "4 Research Methodology and Approach", "content": "The first step of the project will involve identifying with more precision the specific typeof phenomena of interest surrounding cyber threat analysis and their relationship withneighboring fields, including digital sovereignty, cyber warfare, political actors and values. Once these regulations and related phenomena are identified,it will be possible to narrow down what type of cybersecurity terms need to be used inorder to identify actions that in compliance or breaking of such regulations. For example,what kind of cyberattack constitutes an act of violation of the digital sovereignty of a cer-tain country?\nAnswering these types of questions within concrete existing regulations and cyber se-curity terminologies will allow for the creation of a first set of competency questions, thatwill be subsequently made more precise the more ontological terminology is identified tospecify them. These competency questions will eventually take the form of SPARQL que-ries and will be one of the evaluation tools used to assess the success or failure of theproject. This first step allows for the creation of a list of desiderata that ontologies need tobe able to satisfy, as well as a list of core terms coming from the field of law, politicalscience and cybersecurity that are required for the success of an ontological project.\nThe next step involves the review of already existing ontology projects and frame-works, as well as the study of already existing neighboring non-ontological projects suchas vocabularies and taxonomies. For example, MITRE's ATT&CK is one of the mainresources used to represent knowledge of cybersecurity experts and effectively constitutesa well-developed knowledge basis. Other similar projects to be properly investigated in-clude the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX), developed by MITRE for theDHS. The resources thus identified, alongside with the ontologies described in section 2,will then be evaluated for their capability of representing the competency questions andterms identified in the previous step. Moreover, this step will involve identifying the shapetaken by data in these fields, so that the ontology can be properly structured in such a waythat it mirrors it.\nOnce these competency questions are identified, proper development of ontology re-sources can begin. As previously discussed in this paper, D3FEND and UCO on the onehand, and on the other cognate ontologies in CCO and the BFO community such as theCyber Ontology, the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), the Agent ontology, the In-formation Entity Ontology (IEO), and the Geospatial ontology act as collective startingontological basis for the development of my efforts. The method adopted in the processof ontology engineering will follow the two types of questions introduced in section 3 ofthis paper, thus effectively merging bottom-up and top-down ontology development in anexercise of the so-called middle-in ontology development strategy [30]. In this way, theontological resources created can extend from the top- and mid-level layers of BFO andCCO, while also being developed with an eye to the structure of data that needs to be"}, {"title": "5 Evaluation Plan", "content": "The different steps described in the previous section can be evaluated in the course of theproject in different ways. Recall that step 1 involves the identification of the notions inlegal and political science which are needed in order to identify violations of state andprivate actors' rights over their data. This can be tested by creating definitions that are builtand confronted not only with other ontologists in the community, but also with domainexperts in both fields of cybersecurity and legal and political science. Success in step 1 isrepresented by the identification of core terms and notions in the respective fields and bythe creation of first tentative definitions for them. Step 2 involves the formalization ofcompetency questions that use terms and notions identified in the previous step. Thesecompetency questions will act as primary benchmark and use case for the ontological rep-resentations created in next steps. Step 2 will also involve the identification of the type ofdata that the ontologies will be created for \u2013 for example, data packet logs, server logs,access logs, and legal regulation data. Success of step 2 is marked by the creation of asatisfying set of competency questions, that are checked with the domain experts and on-tologists contacted in step 1.\nStep 3 will include the identification of missing terms in existing ontologies, that needto be added in order for them to represent and answer the competency questions createdin previous steps. This step involves the creation of terms and definitions to be added tothe ontologies mentioned above and will be evaluated by the acceptance of the terms bythe ontology communities to which they are proposed to. The final step of the project willinvolve the ingestion of instance level data, for example taken by MITRE's database, andthe testing of the ontology by means of the competency questions identified in previoussteps. If the queries can be successfully applied to the knowledge base thus constructed,reasoning and implicit knowledge extraction will successfully prove the quality of the on-tology and its applicability. This final part of the project will include evaluation by makinguse of the metrics introduced in section 2. A successful step 4 will mark a final positiveresult for the ontology resources created, identifying previously unidentified instances ofbreaking of data sovereignty or ownership. The various steps of the project can each fur-thermore be tested by presenting results to existing ontology conferences in the field ofontologies and law, as well as ontology and cybersecurity, such as FOIS and STIDS."}, {"title": "6 Results", "content": "The state of research is at the moment at its beginnings. Preliminary results include anextensive literature review and evaluation of the existing semantic web projects in cyber-security, presented in section 2 of this paper. As part of these preliminary studies, I havealso started identifying ontologies, data sources and already adopted terminological stand-ards in the field, such as MITRE's ATT&CK and D3FEND, UCO, NIST recommenda-tions, ISO standards such as ISO 27005, and STIMS. A study of foundational notions ofcybersecurity has also begun, as well as contacting cybersecurity experts. One of the firstobjectives in the development of the project is to identify basic design patterns in CCOand BFO that can be used to represent information processing and sharing in the domainof interest of cybersecurity. Fig. 2 is an example of such first results."}, {"title": "7 Conclusions", "content": "The preliminary studies undergone so far show the need for a framework to relate effortsin ontology of cyberspace and cybersecurity with neighboring domains. To remedy thisissue, I have proposed the evaluation and further development of ontological resources incybersecurity and their interaction with ontological representations in the domain of cyberthreat analysis and security studies. Such a project will achieve interoperability betweenheterogeneous data sources from the cybersecurity domain and the domains of securitystudies, information ethics and digital sovereignty. Given the difficulties proper of cyber-security and cyber threat intelligence in data integration, this is an issue of primary concernin an era where analyzing big data for informatic vulnerabilities, sovereignty and rights in-fractions will exponentially develop as a focal problem."}]}

{"title": "Towards an ontology of state actors in cyberspace", "authors": ["Giacomo De Colle"], "abstract": "To improve cyber threat analysis practices in cybersecurity, I present a plan to build a formal ontological representation of state actors in cyberspace and of cyber operations. I argue that modelling these phenomena via ontologies allows for coherent integration of data coming from diverse sources, automated reasoning over such data, as well as intelligence extraction and reuse from and of them. Existing ontological tools in cybersecurity can be ameliorated by connecting them to neighboring domains such as law, regulations, governmental institutions, and documents. In this paper, I propose metrics to evaluate currently existing ontological tools to create formal representations in the cybersecurity domain, and I provide a plan to develop and extend them when they are lacking.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and motivation", "content": "Cyberspace, provisionally understood as the aggregate of computing artifacts, the information they process and the connections between such artifacts, is the source of an immense and variegated body of data. Analyzing this data is at the heart of multiple disciplines, including those that are broadly located in, or related to, the field of cybersecurity, such as digital forensics, cyber threat intelligence, network analysis and incident response. Coherent integration of cyberspace data with data from neighboring fields is nevertheless difficult without a shared semantical framework such as the one that can be specified by a commonly adopted ontology. An ontology able to represent cyberspace and the operations that take place in cyberspace would allow for data sharing between different organizations, thus enabling the breaking of data silos and supporting querying, reasoning, and analysis of large bodies of data coming from different sources.\nTake as an example the following case, illustrated in a simplified way in Fig. 1. An unknown device is starting a TCP handshake process, thus asking to access a certain (part of) a website containing healthcare data. This process is recorded in logs which contain information about data packets shared between different devices, and that convey information about, for example, the IP address of the device starting the TCP request. Can we automatically detect whether the request was warranted, or rather a potential attack coming from a malicious actor? In order to do so, we have to identify the type of information that the device was trying to access, as well as whether the device itself has features that are suspicious. This is possible only if we connect information from at least three different sources: the cyber operation itself (the TCP request), the type of data accessed and what it"}, {"title": "2 State of the Art", "content": "The necessity for a formal representation of the knowledge surrounding cybersecurity has been discussed by different authors [4, 5, 6]. The extensive literature review presented in [7] shows that almost 40 efforts exist in the field of ontological representations of domains related to cybersecurity, and good ontology engineering practice requires for existing resources to be reused when possible. Recall the use case presented above in Fig. 1: in order to ontologically represent such a scenario, there is need for an ontology which is able to bridge data from cyberspace with data in neighboring domains, especially those of documents, agents, intelligence operations, and social entities. This means that the desiderata that such an ontology or ontologies need to satisfy are the following: being non-parochial, which means that they are able to be employed for different use cases of cyberspace representation; as a cognate notion, being able to be used as a hub for extensions; adopting a top-level ontology, which allows for the coherent integration of data already tagged with other ontologies, in order to avoid the creation of an ontology data silos; and the presence of technical terminology, in the ontology, which is directly tied to the domain of interest, and that doesn't suffer from being too generic. These desiderata compose metrics, which will also be used as part of the evaluation for the ontology resources I will myself develop, as discussed later on in this paper.\nAs shown in Table 1, many of the existing projects in the field are not tied to a top-level ontology or are developed for narrow uses such as malware recognition or risk analysis. The ontologies in question are then not able to be adopted for the type of use case presented in Fig. 1, which requires an ontology that can be used for tying together disparate data sources. The Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO), which is now part of a Linux Foundation project, was recently mapped into top-level ontologies such as BFO, but this mapping is only partial [5]. CRATELO, which adopts DOLCE as a top-level architecture [6], and the Cyber ontology, currently developed as part of an IEEE initiative, which adopts BFO and CCO as top- and mid-level architectures [8, 9], are the two projects which better merge a top-level framework with an eye towards cybersecurity. Finally, the D3FEND ontology [10], developed by MITRE, has emerged as a foundational effort in structuring cybersecurity knowledge graphs and can benefit from integration with ATT&CK, as well as one of"}, {"title": "3 Problem Statement and Contributions", "content": "The literature review presented in the section above identified CCO and BFO as a starting ontological ecosystem for developing an ontological representation of cyberspace and state actors. The two ontology projects which are technically better suited to represent cyberspace entities are on the other hand D3FEND and UCO. Leveraging already existing resources like the Cyber Ontology and IAO will allow for coherent mapping and integration"}, {"title": "4 Research Methodology and Approach", "content": "The first step of the project will involve identifying with more precision the specific type of phenomena of interest surrounding cyber threat analysis and their relationship with neighboring fields, including digital sovereignty, cyber warfare, political actors and values [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29]. Once these regulations and related phenomena are identified, it will be possible to narrow down what type of cybersecurity terms need to be used in order to identify actions that in compliance or breaking of such regulations. For example, what kind of cyberattack constitutes an act of violation of the digital sovereignty of a certain country?\nAnswering these types of questions within concrete existing regulations and cyber security terminologies will allow for the creation of a first set of competency questions, that will be subsequently made more precise the more ontological terminology is identified to specify them. These competency questions will eventually take the form of SPARQL queries and will be one of the evaluation tools used to assess the success or failure of the project. This first step allows for the creation of a list of desiderata that ontologies need to be able to satisfy, as well as a list of core terms coming from the field of law, political science and cybersecurity that are required for the success of an ontological project.\nThe next step involves the review of already existing ontology projects and frameworks, as well as the study of already existing neighboring non-ontological projects such as vocabularies and taxonomies. For example, MITRE's ATT&CK is one of the main resources used to represent knowledge of cybersecurity experts and effectively constitutes a well-developed knowledge basis. Other similar projects to be properly investigated include the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX), developed by MITRE for the DHS. The resources thus identified, alongside with the ontologies described in section 2, will then be evaluated for their capability of representing the competency questions and terms identified in the previous step. Moreover, this step will involve identifying the shape taken by data in these fields, so that the ontology can be properly structured in such a way that it mirrors it.\nOnce these competency questions are identified, proper development of ontology resources can begin. As previously discussed in this paper, D3FEND and UCO on the one hand, and on the other cognate ontologies in CCO and the BFO community such as the Cyber Ontology, the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO), the Agent ontology, the Information Entity Ontology (IEO), and the Geospatial ontology act as collective starting ontological basis for the development of my efforts. The method adopted in the process of ontology engineering will follow the two types of questions introduced in section 3 of this paper, thus effectively merging bottom-up and top-down ontology development in an exercise of the so-called middle-in ontology development strategy [30]. In this way, the ontological resources created can extend from the top- and mid-level layers of BFO and CCO, while also being developed with an eye to the structure of data that needs to be"}, {"title": "5 Evaluation Plan", "content": "The different steps described in the previous section can be evaluated in the course of the project in different ways. Recall that step 1 involves the identification of the notions in legal and political science which are needed in order to identify violations of state and private actors' rights over their data. This can be tested by creating definitions that are built and confronted not only with other ontologists in the community, but also with domain experts in both fields of cybersecurity and legal and political science. Success in step 1 is represented by the identification of core terms and notions in the respective fields and by the creation of first tentative definitions for them. Step 2 involves the formalization of competency questions that use terms and notions identified in the previous step. These competency questions will act as primary benchmark and use case for the ontological representations created in next steps. Step 2 will also involve the identification of the type of data that the ontologies will be created for \u2013 for example, data packet logs, server logs, access logs, and legal regulation data. Success of step 2 is marked by the creation of a satisfying set of competency questions, that are checked with the domain experts and ontologists contacted in step 1.\nStep 3 will include the identification of missing terms in existing ontologies, that need to be added in order for them to represent and answer the competency questions created in previous steps. This step involves the creation of terms and definitions to be added to the ontologies mentioned above and will be evaluated by the acceptance of the terms by the ontology communities to which they are proposed to. The final step of the project will involve the ingestion of instance level data, for example taken by MITRE's database, and the testing of the ontology by means of the competency questions identified in previous steps. If the queries can be successfully applied to the knowledge base thus constructed, reasoning and implicit knowledge extraction will successfully prove the quality of the ontology and its applicability. This final part of the project will include evaluation by making use of the metrics introduced in section 2. A successful step 4 will mark a final positive result for the ontology resources created, identifying previously unidentified instances of breaking of data sovereignty or ownership. The various steps of the project can each furthermore be tested by presenting results to existing ontology conferences in the field of ontologies and law, as well as ontology and cybersecurity, such as FOIS and STIDS."}, {"title": "6 Results", "content": "The state of research is at the moment at its beginnings. Preliminary results include an extensive literature review and evaluation of the existing semantic web projects in cybersecurity, presented in section 2 of this paper. As part of these preliminary studies, I have also started identifying ontologies, data sources and already adopted terminological standards in the field, such as MITRE's ATT&CK and D3FEND, UCO, NIST recommendations, ISO standards such as ISO 27005, and STIMS. A study of foundational notions of cybersecurity has also begun, as well as contacting cybersecurity experts. One of the first objectives in the development of the project is to identify basic design patterns in CCO and BFO that can be used to represent information processing and sharing in the domain of interest of cybersecurity. Fig. 2 is an example of such first results."}, {"title": "7 Conclusions", "content": "The preliminary studies undergone so far show the need for a framework to relate efforts in ontology of cyberspace and cybersecurity with neighboring domains. To remedy this issue, I have proposed the evaluation and further development of ontological resources in cybersecurity and their interaction with ontological representations in the domain of cyber threat analysis and security studies. Such a project will achieve interoperability between heterogeneous data sources from the cybersecurity domain and the domains of security studies, information ethics and digital sovereignty. Given the difficulties proper of cybersecurity and cyber threat intelligence in data integration, this is an issue of primary concern in an era where analyzing big data for informatic vulnerabilities, sovereignty and rights infractions will exponentially develop as a focal problem."}]}

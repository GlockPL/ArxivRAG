INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent years, the digital environment for academic\npapers has improved significantly, with the rise of ChatGPT\ncontributing to the development of text analysis tools. These\ntools use prompt engineering, text summarization, and ques-\ntion answering techniques to help researchers extract key\ninformation from large texts[1][2]. However, understanding\nthe basic concept can be challenging for researchers unfa-\nmiliar with a specific topic due to their lack of background\nknowledge[5]. This difficulty can impede their ability to\ndetermine if their ideas have already been discussed and to\nidentify the uniqueness of their research [2]. In this case,\nit is essential to form a high-level overview of topics from\na bird's-eye perspective. This requires more than just listing\nrelevant tasks within the topic. It also involves linking related\nresearch issues across multiple papers and forming a succinct\ncause-and-effect relationship for novice researchers to grasp.\nClassifying an author's abstract in each article and creating\na knowledge graph based on keywords can provide a certain\noverview of research domain [3]. However, since the abstract\ntext does not include detailed information, such as 'issues\nin previous research' and 'issues the author addressed,' it is\ndifficult to link it to prior tasks in that field and the significant\nissues in each task using only the abstract content.\nOn the other hand, most existing knowledge graphs offer\na partial bird's eyes view, focusing on showcasing keyword\nrelevance. This allows experts to quickly understand the\nkey points[4]. However, for researchers unfamiliar with a\nparticular research domain, the concept of a keyword map\nmay be hard to understand. This is due to unclear extraction\ncriteria and excessive conciseness, making it difficult to\ngrasp an overview of the research topic. Thus, it becomes\nnecessary to present high-dimensional knowledge structures\nin a logically structured way. For instance, computer science\narticles typically follow a specific pattern to declare research\nobjectives : They start with historical context, analyze previ-\nous research issues, and then articulate the research purpose\nand contributions to improve the previous works. Therefore,\ncreating an integrated graph to analyze this chain of research\nissues can highlight their correlation of issues across multiple\narticles. This approach could help novice researchers under-\nstand the key points of the research overview more logically.\nTo address the issue mentioned above, we propose a new type\nof knowledge graph for a more comprehensive understanding\nof elements within a specific research topic: the fish-bone\ndiagram, generated by an internal issue ontology, forming\na high-dimensional, concise, and concrete summary. From\nthe analysis, this fish-bone structure may help researchers\nconduct a more efficient bird's eyes view survey for their\nresearch. The contributions of this study are as follows:\n1. Define the issue ontology in academic papers, then\nmanually annotate it at the sentence level to create a dataset.\n2. A logical guide chain is established for novice re-\nsearchers to navigate research topics. This chain, which\nexpresses the research topic \u2192 task \u2192 issue ontology, serves\nas the foundation for in-depth data mining in a bird's eyes\nview survey.\n3. Based on 2., we create a fish-bone diagram to provide\na visual bird's eyes view of multiple academic papers."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "In order to assist with research surveys, the previous\nwork has focused on using important information from\nacademic papers to generate automatic summaries or knowl-\nedge graphs. This involves (1) establishing criteria to iden-\ntify important information and employing machine learning\ntechniques to extract them from academic papers, and (2)\ndeveloping approaches to link cause-and-effect relationships\nof essential information across various articles to improve\nreadability.\nPrevious research that typically generates summarization\nby setting important information includes: Hayashi et al.\nintroduce disentangled paper summarization, where models\ngenerate both contribution and context summaries simulta-\nneously to hint at the contribution overview of a specific\nresearch direction[6]. Liu et al. expanded on this by intro-\nducing ContributionSum, a tool for automatically generating\ndisentangled contributions[7]. This tool identifies author-\nwritten contributions in terms of Approach, Analysis, Result,\nTopic, and Resource. Moreover, integrating cited material\nfrom the contribution text can enhance the summarization by\ncovering multiple papers,such as Chen et al. propose the task\nof citation relation classification based on the contributions\nof cited papers to improve the summarization system for\nscientific papers[8]. These work commonly Summarize the\npart of contribution and related text that provide a road-\nmap for the research survey. However, focusing solely on the\ncontribution may overlook the source of research motivation\nwhat gaps in previous studies prompted the author's\ncontribution? Furthermore, covering the entire research topic\ncomprehensively through the part of contribution alone is\ninsufficient, which makes it difficult to understand the re-\nsearch overview. Conversely, previous research that generates\na knowledge graph may better support understanding the\nresearch overview, such as Chan et al. proposed a rep-\nresentation ontology for an integrated four-space keyword\nbased Knowledge Graph (background, objectives, solutions,\nand findings) using Natural Language Processing technology.\nHowever, the 'abstract' of the paper provides insufficient\ninformation to understand the detailed research issue fully.\nFor instance, the part of 'abstract' seldom underscores the\nelement of improvement from previous research, making it\ndifficult to reflect the clue of author's motivation. Duan et al.\ngenerated summarization of the development of the research\nfield over nearly a decade based on keywords, which played\na key role for novice researchers to grasp the direction of\nthe research field[9]. However, the keyword-based knowl-\nedge graph might be too vague for novice researchers to\nunderstand the inherent logical connections among multiple\nacademic papers. Zhang et al. present a heterogeneous net-\nwork literature recommendation method based on the domain\nknowledge graph and hotspot information composition[10].\nHowever, relying solely on hotspot information is insufficient\nto delve into the historical issues remaining in the research\ndomain and whether these issues have been resolved or not.\nThis study aims to expand the knowledge graph by\nintroducing a new form of fish-bone diagram. Its main\npurpose is to give novice researchers a broad bird's-eye\nview of a research topic. This overview is constructed using\nissue ontology, reflecting the clue of the research task. By\nleveraging the logical structure of this issue ontology, we\ncan effectively assist novice researchers in understanding\nthe knowledge structure and motivation within a specific\nresearch topic."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The methodology of this study is divided into two parts.\nFirst, we provide a detailed definition of Issue Ontology.\nSecond, we introduce the fish-bone diagram, established\nbased on Issue Ontology, to support research survey of bird's\neyes view.\nAs birds can view a city's layout from the sky, including\nskyscrapers, open spaces, mountains, lakes, a similar view\ncan be beneficial for novice researchers. Providing a high\nrange covered bird's eyes view of the entire research topic\nhelps researchers easily understand the logic of motivation\nto explore the direction from that research topic.\nIn academic papers, certain key elements provide insight\ninto the author's reasoning and thought process. These ele-\nments reveal how the author discovers problems, investigates\nthem, and contemplates solutions. This can be regarded as the\nwriting clues of the article. The related sentences that appear\nthroughout the papers make up the clues, which are crucial\nfor readers to grasp the bird's eyes view of the research\ntopic. These critical sentences encompass the concept of\n'issue ontology'. Issues embody various debates within the\nacademic world. Some of these have been resolved, some\nhave been identified but remain unresolved, and others still\nrequire optimization and improvement. Their definitions are\nshown below:\n\u2022 1. Prelude issue: The root task mentioned in the paper\nreflects the historical context of this paper. It is usually\nin the head sentences of the introduction section as the\nsource of clues.\n\u2022 2. Improvable issue: Some shortages the author men-\ntioned from previous work that need to be solved.\n\u2022 3. Emphasize issue: Reflect on the author's purpose,\ncontribution, and what they did.\nFor novice researchers, merely summarizing an overview\nbased on keywords or sentences may not clearly convey the\nlogical structure, which could hinder knowledge management\nof the research topic. To address this, we adopt fish-bone\ndiagram - causal diagrams created by Kaoru Ishikawa, are\nused to display the potential causes of a specific event.\nThis type of diagram aids in understanding the learning\nlogic from multiple articles. It includes preliminary tasks,\nchallenges encountered, and the highlighted goals within a\nresearch topic. We present the issue ontology as a fish-bone\ndiagram - a new knowledge graph for establishing the logical\nstructure of issues in academic papers."}, {"title": "IV. IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "This chapter describes the process of developing a fish-\nbone diagram that provides a bird's-eye view of the Hot-\npotQA research topic, based on the S2orc dataset. The\noverview of implementation is shown in Fig.2. Table II\ndisplays the APIs and models used at each stage of devel-\nopment.\nThe first step in constructing the bird's eyes view survey\ndataset is choosing a topic and filtering the relevant sub-\ndataset from the S2orc dataset. We iterate through each\npaper in the S2orc dataset, pulling out those that mention\n'HotpotQA' for our sub-set. This sub-set comprises the\nfull-text content and annotation-info of the papers linked\nwith 'HotpotQA.' Next, we segment the text in 'introduc-\ntion' section into sentences using 'en_core_sci_lg'model from\nspaCy\u00b3 [14] a comprehensive pipeline for biomedical data,\nincluding a 785k vocabulary and 600k word vectors. It\nprovides impressive segmentation accuracy. Any complex\nsegmentation patterns that failed were manually corrected.\n1) Human annotation: To create a machine learning\ndataset, experts annotated the sentence-implied issue ontol-\nogy types based on the definitions provided in Section III.B.\nWe strictly followed the rules detailed below during this\nannotation process.\n(1) In a few cases where two types of issue ontologies\nappear in one sentence, we manually split the sentence to\nensure that each sentence carries only one type of issue\nontology.\n(2) If the author hypothesizes about a topic, it is also con-\nsidered a contribution. Therefore, marked as an 'Emphasize\nissue.' Also, assessing the issue of a sentence in isolation\nis challenging, as the broader context of the targeted paper\ninfluences the annotation process.\n(3) For sentences that do not fit our established issue on-\ntology, we classify them as 'others' in our machine learning\nconfiguration. These sentences might include 1. explanations\nof reasons, 2. meaning of sentence do not match any of the\nthree types of issue ontology, 3. Issues have been addressed\nin previous research mentioned, and 4. experimental results\nor performance achievements.\nWe found that the prelude issue typically emerges within\nthe first 2-3 sentences of the 'introduction' section. Fur-\nthermore, the initial two sentences in most articles are\nusually sufficient to indicate the article's background task.\nConsequently, during the subsequent task clustering stage,\nwe select the first two sentences from 'introduction' as the\nprelude issue for input.\n2) Result of issue ontology classification: We utilize the\n'Distilbert-base-uncased'[15] pre-training model in Sentence\nBERT[13] for sentence vectorization. This model was trained\nusing resources like Wikipedia and BookCorpus. We chose\nsupport vector machine(SVM) for classifying the vectorized\nsentences, as it demonstrates robust generalization perfor-\nmance. We also employ the grid search method [17] to\nidentify the best parameters to apply. The datasets are shown\nin the TABLE III The classification results are shown in the\nTABLE IV, and the total classification accuracy has reached\n78%, which proves the effectiveness of the small-scale\ntraining data. However, since sentences with 'emphasizing\nissue' constitute a large portion of the collected articles, the\nimbalance in dataset labels may influence the classification\nresults of 'improvable issue.'\nWe configure the fish-bone diagram to approach Figure 1\nfollowing the description in Table I.\n1) Joint: Prelude issue clustering & task name gener-\nation: In this section, we introduce the process of using\nprelude issue ontology content to construct the joint (effect)\nof fish-bone. We start by selecting the first two sentences\nfrom the 'introduction' section of each article to serve\nas the prelude issue. For sentence vector embedding, we\nalso use the 'distilbert-base-uncased' model from Sentence\nBERT. These sentence vectors are then clustered using the\nk-means[16] method. Finally, we generate the task name\nfor each category via simple prompt engineering by the\ndescription 'Find a theme for the following text, and the\ngenerated theme is limited to within 5 words.' These tasks\nform the joint (effect) component of the fish-bone.\n2) Back-bone & Fine-bone: We extend n branches from\nthe task's joint to identify factors impacting each task. These\nbranches represent the 'Emphasize' and 'Improvable' issues\nassociated with the task. Each branch is created using the re-\nsults of the set of Sentence BERT + issue cluster by k-means,\nand prompt engineering description 'Your task is to find n\nthemes for the following text, Limit each theme to 5 words'\ncollectively referred to as 'fine-bones'. Here n represents\nthe number of fine-bone to be generated. These 'fine-bones',\ncomposed of issue ontologies, significantly influence tasks,\nwhich is why we refer to them as contributing factors.\n3) Child-bone: We build the child-bone, the most basic\nunit of the fish-bone design, derived from the fine-bone. This\nis done using the 'Improvable issue' \u2190\u2192 'Emphasize issue'\nlogic chain within the research task. These logic connections\ndiverge and radiate based on a cluster of real connections of\nthe issue ontology. Specifically, we link the 'emphasize issue\u2018\nthat appears in the article corresponding to each fine-bone to\nthe 'improvable issue' that appears in the same article, and\nthen use the prompt engineering to generate a brief summary\nof the sentence groups of 'improvable issue', completing the\nconnection between the issue summaries. The process is the\nsame when shifting from 'improvable issue' to 'emphasized\nissue.'"}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "This study focused on automatically generating bird's-eye\nview fish-bone diagrams for research topics to assist\nnovice researchers. This process uses issue ontology units,\nlogically organized and expanded to generate the diagrams.\nWe started by collecting introductory text from academic\npapers related to a specific research topic, which was then\nsegmented into sentences level. Expert researchers annotated\nthese sentences according to the implied issue ontology\ntype, forming the training dataset for the bird's-eye view\nsurvey. Next, we utilized rule-based and machine learning\nmethods to categorize and extract sentences related to\nprelude, improvable, and emphasized issues. We summarize\nthe prelude issues to form the tasks of the diagram using\nclustering and prompt engineering. The backbone and fine-\nbones, which illustrate the cause-and-effect relationship,\nwere created from the summarized \u2018emphasized issues\u2019\nand 'improvable issues' by issue ontology classification,\nclustering and prompt engineering. Subsequently, we\ngenerated the child-bone from the objectives logical of\n'emphasize issue'\u2190\u2192\u2018improvable issues'. Lastly, we\nevaluated the readability of the generated diagram and the\nsustainability of the development through case analyses. For\nthe future expansion and improvement of this study, the\nfollowing points are proposed:\n(1) Expanding the issue ontology: This study focused on\nautomatically generating a fish-bone diagram from the\n'introduction' sections of academic papers. However, issues\ndiscussed in other sections, like addressed and improvable\nissues in the 'related work' section, or resolved and finding\nissues in the 'conclusion' section, are not covered. These\nissue ontologies can also highlight key research points, such\nas problems addressed across multiple articles and future\nresearch directions. Hence, identifying these types of issue\nontologies is a task for future work.\n(2) Analysis relevance of novelty: By analyzing the\nRelevance of Novelty: We can study the novelty's relevance\nby combining addressed, improvable, and emphasized\nissues. For example, we can consider similar addressed or\nimprovable issues across multiple articles with different\nemphasized issues to implement originality analysis, which\ncan provide additional insights for researchers."}]}

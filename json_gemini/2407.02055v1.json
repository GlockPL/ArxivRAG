In the seminal paper [6], Dung introduced abstract ar- gumentation frameworks, conceived as directed graphs where nodes represent arguments and edges between nodes represent attacks. Their meaning is given by so-called argumentation semantics that determine which sets of arguments can be reasonably upheld together given such an argumentation graph. Var- ious authors have since remarked that other relations between arguments are worth consideration, such as, for example, a dual support relation as in bipo- lar argumentation frameworks [5]. The last decades witnessed a proliferation\nIn systems biology, Biological regulatory networks encode interactions be- tween biological specimens or compounds, such as proteins or genes, and their interactions, to acquire a better understanding of the complex processes that take place in cells, as doing so may lead to discoveries and new theories about liv- ing organisms. To abstract from actual concentration values, and use thresholds to represent whether a compound is active or inactive, Logical models [10, 27] are often used instead of quantitative models. Because of that, they require far less information than quantitative models and are therefore more adequate to deal with incomplete, imprecise, and noisy information regarding the biological system. Among these, Boolean (logical) models or networks (BNs), have been extensively used to reproduce known behaviour and test new hypotheses in sil- ico, e.g., as models of gene regulation networks and other biological systems [23]."}, {"title": "2 Abstract Dialectical Frameworks", "content": "We recall ADFs following loosely the notation from [3]. An ADF D is a tuple D = (At, L,C) where At is a finite set of atoms, representing arguments or statements, L \u2286 At \u00d7 At is a set of links, representing dependencies or attacks from one argument against another, and C = {Cs}s\u2208At is a set of total functions (also called acceptance functions) Cs: 2pard(s) \u2192 {1,0} for each s \u2208 At with parp(s) = {s' \u2208 At | (s', s) \u2208 L} and truth values true (1) and false (0). An ac- ceptance function Cs defines the cases when the statement s can be accepted (is true), depending on the acceptance status of its parents in D. We often identify an acceptance function Cs by its equivalent acceptance condition which models the acceptable cases as a propositional formula over At and the usual Boolean connectives \u2227 (and), \u2228 (or), \u00ac (negation) and \u2192 (material implication). Also, the set of links of D is completely determined by Cs and sometimes left implicit.\nDefinition 1. Let D be an ADF with \u03bd \u2208 V(At) a 3-valued interpretation.

During this presentation, we will establish sometimes surprising connections to ADFs as well as notable differences between these two formalisms.\nBoolean networks utilize a regulatory graph to represent the compounds in the biological process and the principal interactions between them.\nDefinition 2. A regulatory graph is a directed graph G = (V, E), where V = {v1, ..., vn} is the set of vertices (nodes) representing the regulatory compounds, and E = {(u, v, s) : u, v \u2208 V, s \u2208 {+,\u2212}} is the set of signed edges representing the interactions between compounds.\nAn edge with s = + is called positive interaction (or activation), representing that u activates v, while an edge with s= \u2212 is called negative interaction (or inhibition), representing that u inhibits v. A node with no incoming edges is called input node, representing external stimuli, whose values do not change.\nBoolean logical models then add regulatory functions for each compound to specify how different compounds that affect the same node interact with each other for that node's activation.\nDefinition 3. A Boolean logical model M of a regulatory network is defined as a tuple (V, F) where V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} is the set of variables representing\nDefinition 4. Let M = (V, F) be a Boolean logical model of a regulatory network with regulatory graph G = (V, E). We define the corresponding ADF DM,G = (V, L, F) with L = {(u, v) | (u, v, s) \u2208 E}.\nLet D = (At, L, C) be an ADF with C in NNF. We define the corresponding Boolean logical model MD = (At, C) of a regulatory network with regulatory graph GD = (At, E) with E = {(u, v, +) | u \u2208 Cv } \u222a {(u, v, \u2212) | \u00acu \u2208 Cv }.\nThe requirement for the acceptance conditions to be in Negation Normal Form (NNF) is necessary to include the correct edges in GD. Alternatively, one can determine the polarity using Definition 11 below.\nBNs allow us to capture the changes over time in a biological process based on the interactions of the various compounds involved, which should correctly represent the dynamics observable in the real system. We will see that the study of dynamics in BNs correspond to semantics of ADFs. We start with network states that are used to represent the (current) activations of a network's compounds.\nDefinition 5. The network state of a BN with n compounds is a vector S = [v1, v2, ...vn] where vi is the value of the variable representing the i-th compound of the network.\nThe update of the i-th compound vi of a network from one discrete time point t to the next is then defined as vi(t+1) = fi(S(t)) for state S(t) at time t, which clearly exactly corresponds to the evaluation of an acceptance condition in ADFs. We can then use state transition graphs [17] to describe how networks, and thus the modelled biological systems, evolve over time.\nDefinition 6. A State Transition Graph (STG) is a directed graph GSTG = (S,T) where S is the set of vertices representing the different states of the net- work, and T is the set of edges representing the viable transitions between states.\nDefinition 7. Given an STG GSTG = (S,T), a set S' \u2286 S is a trap set of GSTG if, for every w \u2208 S', (\u03c9,\u03c9') \u2208 T implies w' \u2208 S'. An attractor is a C-minimal trap set. A stable state of G is a singleton trap set of G.\nProposition 1. Let GSTG be the synchronous state transition graph of the Boolean Model M with regulatory graph G, and DM,G the corresponding ADF. Then, w is a stable state of GSTG iff w is a two-valued model of DM,G.\nDefinition 8. A subspace m of a regulatory graph (V, E) is a mapping m : V \u2192 {0,1,*}. We call v \u2208 V fixed if m(v) \u2208 {0,1} and free if m(v) = *, and Dm is the set of all fixed variables in m. We let S[m] := {s \u2208 S | \u2200v \u2208 Dm : s(v) = m(v)}.\nProposition 2. Let m be a subspace m, and vm : V \u2192 {0,1, U} defined by\n$v_m(v) = \\begin{cases}m(v) & \\text{if } v \\in D_m\\\\ U & \\text{otherwise.} \\end{cases}$\nIt holds that $[v_m]^2 = S[m]$.\nDefinition 9. A trap space is a subspace that is also a trap set.\nProposition 3. Let M be a Boolean Model with regulatory graph G, and DM,G the corresponding ADF: m is a trap space of M iff vm is admissible in DM,G.\nProposition 4. Let m1, m2 be two subspaces. Then m1 \u2264 m2 iff Vm2 \u2264i Vm1\u00b7\nProposition 5.

In fact, both strands of literature have identified the same subclass! In the literature on ADFs, these frameworks are called bipolar ADFs, whereas in the literature on Boolean networks, they are called sign-definite.\nDefinition 10. A Boolean function f : {0,1}n \u2192 {0,1} is increasing monotone if for every v1, v2 \u2208 {0,1}n, v1 \u2264 v2 implies f(v1) \u2264 f(v2), and it is decreasing monotone if for every v1, v2 \u2208 {0,1}n, v1 \u2264 v2 implies f(v1) \u2265 f(v2). A Boolean function is sign-definite if it is increasing or decreasing monotone. A Boolean logical model (V, F) is sign-definite if every Boolean function in F is sign-definite.\nIt is well-known that a Boolean function is sign-definite if and only if it can be represented by a formula in disjunctive normal form in which all occurrences of a given literal are either negated or non-negated [1].\nWe now recall bipolar ADFs [25].\nDefinition 11.

We follow Aracena [2] in defining a path in a BN as positive if the number of negative arcs is even, and negative otherwise.\nProposition 7. If a sign-definite BN has: no cycles, then it has a unique stable state [22]; no positive cycles, then it has at most one stable state [19]; no negative cycles, then it has at least one stable state [20].

Introduction", "content": "The application of drones powered by artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed numerous industries, offering innovative solutions to previously intractable problems. In logistics, drones enable rapid delivery in remote or congested areas, reducing transportation time and costs [1]. In agriculture, they assist in crop monitoring, pest control, and irrigation management through real-time aerial imaging and analytics [2]. In the fields of surveillance and security, drones are deployed for border monitoring, crowd control, and disaster response, where their ability to provide real-time insights proves invaluable [3]. Environmental monitoring further benefits from drones as they collect data on wildlife, deforestation, and pollution in areas that are otherwise difficult or unsafe for human access [4]. AI has significantly advanced the functionality and versatility of drones [5,6], addressing critical challenges across diverse applications by enhancing their precision, efficiency, and autonomy. In industries such as agriculture, drones equipped with AI-powered imaging systems can monitor crops, detect disease, and estimate yields with remarkable accuracy [7,8]. By processing high-resolution data in real time, these drones provide actionable insights to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest management, leading to increased productivity and reduced resource wastage [9,10]. In logistics, Al-driven drones streamline delivery operations by identifying optimal routes and overcoming challenges posed by remote or urban congested areas, thereby improving speed and reducing operational costs [11,12]. Al-powered drones also play a pivotal role in public safety and disaster management [13]. In emergency scenarios, they can quickly assess damage, locate survivors, and deliver essential supplies, often operating in environments that are inaccessible or hazardous for human responders. For instance, AI-enabled drones can penetrate disaster zones and provide crucial data to guide rescue operations [14]. In environmental applications, drones perform tasks such as wildlife tracking, forest monitoring, and pollution mapping, leveraging AI algorithms to detect subtle environmental changes or anomalies [15]. These capabilities allow for proactive interventions and more efficient conservation strategies. For example, AI-powered drones collect critical environmental data, such as temperature, moisture, and air quality, aiding in climate modeling and ecosystem monitoring [16].\nDeploying Al programs in drones and similar computer systems presents several critical challenges, particularly in achieving seamless integration and efficiency [5,17]. These challenges stem from the current reliance on specialized hardware and software frameworks, which often require high-performance computing platforms, such as GPUs, to execute Al algorithms for tasks like object detection, image analysis, and autonomous decision-making [7,8]. Drones are typically equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, infrared, and ultrasonic devices, to gather the diverse data streams needed for Al-driven operations [9,12]. However, the integration of these components is far from seamless [18,19]. One of the primary obstacles is the fragmented nature of AI deployment. Al programs are often developed and implemented in isolated systems, each designed for specific tasks or sensor inputs. This lack of cohesion makes it difficult to achieve efficient data sharing and interoperability between different modules. For example, vision systems may process images independently of navigation or perception systems, resulting in de-lays or inconsistencies in real-time decision-making. Such fragmentation also increases the complexity of system design, maintenance, and scaling, limiting the ability to create unified, adaptable solutions. Another critical challenge is the absence of uniform standards for deploying AI in drone systems. Currently, different manufacturers and developers use varying architectures, protocols, and development tools, creating compatibility issues and hindering the scalability of AI applications. This lack of standardization not only complicates the integration of AI algorithms across multiple systems but also restricts the collaboration between drones, particularly in multi-drone operations requiring synchronized actions and real-time communication. Moreover, real-time processing is a persistent issue due to the high computational demands of AI models and the limitations of onboard hardware. The need to balance computational load, energy efficiency, and latency often forces developers to make trade-offs that can impact the system's overall performance and reliability. These limitations are particularly critical in drone applications, where split-second decisions can be the difference between success and failure.\nTo address these challenges, there is an urgent need for integrated systems that unify hardware and software components, streamline data processing, and establish standardized frameworks for AI deployment. Such systems would not only enhance interoperability and scalability but also improve real-time performance and reduce development complexities, paving the way for more advanced and reliable AI-powered drone solutions. In this con-text, we present an advanced artificial intelligence operating system specifically designed to address the challenges of deploying AI in drone applications.

Counterfactual explanation is an important method in the field of interpretable machine learning, which can not only help users understand why machine learning models make specific decisions, but also help users understand how to change these decisions. Naturally, it is an important task to study the robustness of counterfactual explanation generation algorithms to model changes. Previous literature has proposed the concept of Naturally-Occurring Model Change, which has given us a deeper understanding of robustness to model change. In this paper, we first further generalize the concept of Naturally-Occurring Model Change, proposing a more general concept of model parameter changes, Generally-Occurring Model Change, which has a wider range of applicability. We also prove the corresponding probabilistic guarantees. In addition, we consider a more specific problem, data set perturbation, and give relevant theoretical results by combining optimization theory.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 Background", "content": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) [2] is a crucial research domain aimed at enhancing the transparency of machine learning algorithms to make their decision-making and predictions more comprehensible and interpretable[16].

In general, we can define the following concept using the norm || . || on X:\nDefinition 1 (Counterfactuals * induced by norm || . ||). For any x \u2208 X satisfying m(x) < 0.5, its counterfactual with respect to m(\u00b7) and || \u00b7 || is:\n$x^* := \\underset{x \\in R^d}{\\operatorname{argmin}} ||x - \\hat{x}|| \\text{ s.t. } m(\\hat{x}) \\geq 0.5.$ \nThe selection of an appropriate metric or norm is a meaningful problem, and there has been extensive research in the literature on this topic. For example, researchers have studied the selection of the l\u2081-norm [20], the 12-norm [14], the Mahalanobis distance [13], and so on.\nHowever, as pointed out by [1,13], counterfactuals solved solely based on a certain metric or norm may deviate significantly from the potential distribution of the data, which is very unreasonable. For example, in a medical scenario, the counterfactual solved requires the height of the input instance to change by 3 meters, which is completely unrealistic. Therefore, Faisal Hamman et al. [11] defined the following concept:\nDefinition 2 (Closest Data-Manifold Counterfactuals * induced by norm || || [11]). For any x \u2208 X satisfying m(x) < 0.5, its closest data manifold counterfactual with respect to m(\u00b7) and || \u00b7 || is:\n$\\hat{x}^* := \\underset{\\Xi \\in X}{\\operatorname{argmin}} ||x - \\hat{x}|| \\text{ s.t. } m(\\hat{x}) \\geq 0.5.$\nA closely related metric to the Definition 2 is the Local Outlier Factor [6], which has been widely applied."}, {"title": "2.2 Gradient Descent", "content": "Gradient Descent (GD) is a classical optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function [24].

[11] point out, the assumption that changes in model parameters always lead to changes in classification performance is inappropriate. Instead, we should focus more on changes in the classification performance of the model rather than the changes in the parameters themselves. Their revision of Equation (2) is similar to the concept of equivalence classes in pure mathematics: those changes in model parameters that do not change the shape of the decision boundary should be tolerated. Specifically, Faisal Hamman et al. define Naturally-Occurring Model Change as follows:\nDefinition 5 (Naturally-Occurring Model Change, [11]). A naturally-occurring model change is defined as follows:\n1. Expectation condition. We assume that the following equation holds:\n$E[M(X)|X = x] = E[M(x)] = m(x),$\nwhere the expectation is over the randomness of M(\u00b7) given a fixed value of X = x \u2208 Rd."}, {"title": "3.2 Probabilistic Guarantee", "content": "For naturally-occurring model change, Faisal Hamman et al.

The probability is over the randomness of both M and Xi's.\nIn the Equation (3), Rk,62 (x,m) is the stability measure proposed by Faisal Hamman et al.. They point out that in the concrete computation, because y is unknown, only the relaxed version of Rk,62 can be computed:\n$R_{k,\\sigma^2} = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{X_i\\in N_{x,k}} (m(x_i) - \\gamma\\cdot |m(x) - m(x_i)|) .$\nMeanwhile, they proposed the Counterfactual Robustness Test: Rk,\u03c3\u03b5 > \u03c4. According to Theorem 1, setting a larger \u03c4 will guarantee that the new model M(\u00b7) has a higher validity with high probability. To better understand Theorem 1, Equation (3) can be written as follows:\n$\\Pr \\left( \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} m(X_i) - M(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\gamma\\cdot||x - X_i||_2 + \\varepsilon \\right) \\leq \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k\\varepsilon^2}{8(\\gamma + \\gamma_m)^2\\sigma^2}\\right).$\nEquation (4) provides an intuitive understanding of Theorem 1: the prediction of the new model M(\u00b7) for x is approximately equal to the average prediction of the original model m(\u00b7) for x in its neighborhood.\nFor the more general concept of generally-occurring model change, we provide the following probabilistic guarantee:"}, {"title": "3.3 Proof of Theorem 2", "content": "Before proving Theorem 2, we present the following lemma:\nLemma 1 (Deviation Bound).

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent years, 5G communication technologies have enabled connectivity and innovation [1]. However, the horizon is already set on the potential of 6G, the next generation of a wave of innovation in wireless communications [2]. The core components of the 6G infrastructure are heterogeneous networks and a massively distributed nature [3]. Therefore, 6G requires innovative software development and system integration approaches seamlessly blending emerging technologies like AI, Quantum Computing, and Edge Computing [3]\u2013[6].\nHowever, current software architectures and development methodologies fail to address the scalability and energy efficiency required for 6G systems [1], [5]\u2013[7]. The ambitious 6G vision and conjectured use cases lead to demands in data rates above 100 Gbps, fraction of millisecond (ms) latencies, and reliability in the order of 10-7 to 10-9, which are beyond what is currently supported by 5G [8]. Therefore, also Kubernetes\u00b9, the most common orchestrator for cloud and edge computing, needs external help to properly scale and be of any use in this new scenario [9]. On the same topic, a recent study showed how Kubernetes was outperformed in IoT use cases leveraging 6G networks [10].\nThe 6GSoft project, a Finnish project funded by Business Finland, aims to investigate sustainable software solutions that are robust, scalable, and energy-efficient. This initiative is not just about keeping pace with technological evolution. Still, it is also driven by the strategic necessity to secure a competitive edge in the global market and avoid past pitfalls experienced by major Finnish corporations in the telecom sector. The goals of the project are manifold:\n\u2022 Develop sustainable software development methods tailored for the 6G era, focusing on processes and tools that integrate with heterogeneous systems, including IoT, AI, and quantum computing (QC).\n\u2022 Implement energy-aware (EA) orchestration and scalability models that minimize energy consumption while maximizing performance across distributed networks.\n\u2022 Foster a business-driven software development model that aligns with emerging 6G technology requirements, ensuring that software architecture and business strategies are cohesively integrated.\nThe outcomes of the 6GSoft project will have a profound impact on both industry and academia. By setting new benchmarks in software development for next-generation edge-to-cloud systems, the project aims to significantly enhance software businesses' productivity, speed, and quality, potentially increasing the market shares by substantial margins.\nThe collaboration framework, established through this project, involves four Finnish universities and four local companies, aiming at promoting a robust ecosystem for future technology development in the context of edge-to-cloud and"}, {"title": "II.

OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS", "content": "6G technology is set to profoundly impact SE by ushering in faster data transmission speeds, ultra-low latency for real-time applications like remote surgery and autonomous vehicles, and the ability to connect many IoT devices simultaneously [11]. Thus, edge computing capabilities should expand and be optimized to support the daunting computational tasks demanded. Moreover, more devices connected to 6G infrastructure will call for new security and privacy challenges toward robust encryption and data protection in SE. On the same vein, EAorchestration will also be a key factor, due 6G's extensive support for device connectivity, where resource efficiency and dynamic allocation policies must be implemented to optimize energy consumption. New AI models such as \"liquid Al\" already exhibit promising results in the new 6G nodes [12]. On the one hand, integrating newly AI-based technologies and paradigms, 6G can potentially optimize network management and security as 6G networks become more pervasive, demanding innovative encryption and cyber defense solutions [12]\u2013[14]. On the other hand, energy efficiency nowadays is a non-negligible aspect. Ensuring robust security and privacy protections will also be critical. Finally, SE development methodologies, e.g., agile, should be tuned to keep up with higher speed, lower latency communication, and faster development cycles for much-needed critical software updates to real-time infrastructure.\nTherefore, the 6GSoft project has four main objectives: (1)To develop sustainable SE practices for the 6G era. (2) To create EAorchestration and scalability models. (3) To provide architectural support for advanced cloud-continuum systems.

SUMMARY OF CURRENT CONTRIBUTIONS", "content": "Regarding sustainable SE practices for the 6G era, we reviewed the literature on AI-assisted requirements engineering [21]. Our study unveiled a trend of large language model (LLM) based approaches for requirements traceability. We further investigated the effectiveness of these LLM-based approaches to find the traceability links between code commits and requirements. We are currently expanding the programming languages on which we tested the commitsto-requirement traceability with promising results. We also investigated the privacy and regulatory challenges involved in the data and machine learning models for 6G infrastructure [22]\u2013[27]. Moreover, we reviewed the state-of-theart orchestration technologies to understand the feasibility of these technologies for next-generation software in terms of the methods, techniques, and tools reviewed and developed [28]\u2013[31] for this purpose.\nRegarding EAorchestration and scalability models, we investigated auction-based orchestration methods for heterogeneous cloud and edge providers [32]. Our findings include isomorphic implementation methods, particularly WebAssembly [33], [34]. Furthermore, we investigated on multi-layered cloud-native system architecture reconstruction, including testing, pattern detection, and maintenance [26], [31], [35]\u2013[41]\nRegarding architectural support for advanced 6G software We researched a prototype for next-generation software applications involving decentralized deployment in the cloud-edge continuum, leveraging machine learning and language models. Moreover, relevant to this context is our work, as mentioned earlier on prototypes for decentralized, cloud-edge continuum software applications that leverage machine learning and language models [11], [25], [33], [34] and multi-layered cloud-native system architecture reconstruction, including testing, pattern detection, and maintenance [27], [31], [31], [35]\u2013[41]. Futhermore, we identified the current research status in SE practices focusing on software process, typical software architecture, orchestration, and offloading methods applied in the context of 6G [11], [37].\nFinally, regarding business-driven development models, in the context of 6G software business ecosystem modeling, we investigated bridging the gap between 6G technology and software business, with emphasis on the critical role of the business perspective for 6G commercialization [42]\u2013[44]. Moreover, we conceptualize an analysis of the 6G ecosystem pioneering research to understand the components, including related concepts, sub-concepts, antecedents, and consequences of the 6G ecosystem. In this context are also the above-mentioned contributions on privacy and regulatory challenges involved in data and machine learning for 6G infrastructure [22], [23].\nMoreover, we studied the potential role of QC in shaping the future of 6G technology. We discussed the issues of QC for 6G and identified 15 critical applications, which include quantum machine learning optimization, quantum positioning, and enhanced signal processing [43]. These applications show the promise of quantum technologies and the vision of a quantum internet in enhancing networks' performance, security, and efficiency. Altogether, these works offer a systematic approach to incorporating quantum technologies into 6G networks with new perspectives. In another study [44], we proposed a success probability prediction model for secure quantum communication in 6G technology employing QKD as a security boosting mechanism. This model incorporates predictive analysis for the probability of secure communication channels to address the critical cyber security requirements for 6G."}, {"title": "V. IMPACT AND THREATS", "content": "A possible threat to the validity of our preliminary results on sustainable SE practices for the 6G era lies in the evolving and speculative nature of 6G technology [3]\u2013[6].

RELATED WORK", "content": "Recently, studies regarding software engineering practices for 6G, software process, architecture, orchestration and offloading methods, and business-driven software development have been the main topics for 6G software engineering [11]. Since 2022, the number of published papers has increased sharply in this domain. Amongst these publications, software architecture is the area that has received the most attention in 6G Software Engineering. Other covered topics include software tequirements [49], SE models and methods [50], software quality [51], software orchestration [52], offloading [51] and energy aware [53]. Therein, the software process, architecture, and orchestration publications are still limited, while business-driven software development is nonexistent.\nAl-Hammadi et al. [54] implement a collaborative offloading method among MEC servers based on the edge server's resources and neighbors' status to alleviate network congestion and formulate a hierarchy SDN-powered MEC network framework comprising three tiers in the method. Habibi et al. [50] provide guidelines on how the novel software building blocks can be integrated and deployed as part of a DevOps workflow and propose an M&O framework for 6G simultaneously. Alotaibi and Barnawi [55] propose IDSoft, a novel software solution that resides across the network infrastructure and leverages 6G enabling technologies. Shukla et al. [56] propose 6G-SDI, an SDN-based green communication method for 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) to control real-time actuation and flow-table configuration. Abdulqadder and Zhou [57] tackle the issues, such as security, quality of service (QoS), and resource consumption issues, through related network slicing and load balancing methods in SDN/NFV-assisted 6G environments. In addition, except for the first two papers that propose the framework in the methods, three other papers present the framework separately. Meenakshi et al. [53] use a framework constructing a design of systematic Wireless Inventory trackers (WIT) using heterogeneous IoT(HIoT) networks over 6G Computing and MEC/SDWAN for improving the prolonged lifetime and low energy consumption for efficient communication in 6G network. Manogaran et al. [52] propose the service virtualization and flow management framework (SVFMF) for the reliable utilization of resources in the 6G-cloud environment. Janbi et al. [58] propose a framework for Distributed AI as a Service (DAIaaS) provisioning for Internet of Everything (IoE) and 6G environments.\nRegarding 6G architectures and platforms, Bojovi\u0107 et al. [59] designed a multi-slice architecture to develop highly flexible dynamic queue management software and moved it entirely to the application layer. Alonso-Lupez et al. [60] propose an architecture enabling privacy-aware slicing and security service orchestration. Moreover, Alotaibi and Barnawi [55] propose HFL (hierarchical FL) architecture with an additional offloading mechanism to enhance and evaluate performance in terms of relevant FL aspects, such as accuracy, communication efficiency, and convergence. Tao et al. [61] propose a novel software-defined DTN architecture with digital twin function virtualization (DTFV) for adaptive 6G service response. On the other hand, for the results of \"Platform,\" Ateya et al. [51] develop a MEC platform and introduce a seamless migration for complex 5G/6G tasks. Furthermore, Katiyar et al. [49] develop an IoT platform and focus on its middleware layer connection with other layers. Then Cao et al.

Unlike the previous, Kamruzzaman and Alruwaili [63] propose a system and use an optimizing computer vision with AI-enabled technology (OCV-AI model).\nRegarding algorithms, Ajibola et al. [64] propose a heuristic for energy-efficient and delay-aware placement (HEEDAP) of applications in fog networks (an algorithm). Cao et al. [65] propose an efficient algorithm, labeled TailoredSlice-6G, to implement the tailored resource allocation of slices in 6G networks.

AI assisted requirements tracing", "content": "In the era of 6G, collaboration between distributed and heterogeneous stakeholders grows where requirements tracing is critical to the success of software projects. Research on requirements traceability primarily addresses traceability link generation [67]\u2013[72], traceability link recovery [67], [68], [73]\u2013[75], and bug localization [68], [75].\nMany AI methods have been proposed to recover traceability links to achieve reliable results, especially in large, complex software projects with vast repositories, diverse software artifacts, and extensive codebases. Lyu et al. [68] reviewed 40 primary studies from 2011 to 2022, focusing on using Information Retrieval and Machine Learning techniques to generate and recover traceability links. These studies addressed challenges such as accuracy, effort, support, information, and trustworthiness in requirements traceability. Notably, 50% of these studies concentrated on traceability link recovery, while 30% focused on link generation. This finding aligns with [69], which reviewed 53 primary studies from 2012 to 2021, noting that 26 studies were dedicated to requirements traceability. Other secondary studies on AI for requirements engineering such as [67], [70], [71], [73]\u2013[76] also emphasized the importance of requirements traceability in research.\nBefore 2018, requirements tracing primarily relied on IR techniques, using methods like TF-IDF, VSM, and Random Forests to automate link recovery between issue reports and commits. Bug localization utilized algorithms such as SZZ, while LSI and LDA improved trace link accuracy. After 2018, research evolved to hybrid techniques, integrating ML, NLP, and other AI methods.

[83] provided similar findings, with Kos leading in CPU tests and K3s and MicroShift in memory tests.\nFor energy efficiency, Deep Q-Learning (DQN) [84] optimizes by offloading data, reducing energy use, and shortening service workflow completion times. The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Optimization Algorithm [85] manages to offload complex tasks efficiently in terms of time and energy.

Software Architecture for 6G Era", "content": "In the 6G era, the need to use architecture definition language has become more critical due to next-generation networks' increased complexity and interoperability requirements [3], [87], [88]. Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) express a system architecture clearly and precisely, thus modeling intervening artifacts of different technologies that ensure seamless and smooth integration, enhanced scalability of mechanisms, and robust security frameworks [89]. Providing a clear blueprint of this type of architecture, ADL helps streamline development processes, cutting down errors, speeding up the delivery of innovative services into reality in 6G, and driving the evolution toward an efficient and reliable communication infrastructure. Therefore, we explored the features and functionality of existing ADLs [89]. Unlike modeling languages such as UML, which capture behavior and structure, ADLs primarily focus on structural aspects, emphasizing component representation and interactions [89], [90]. This focus allows ADLs to offer a high level of abstraction, facilitating intellectual control over system architecture design and evaluation [91].\nThe evolution of ADLs can be divided into three periods [92]: Theory. During this phase, research focused on formal approaches to characterize components, behavior, and connections. Notations were developed to define structures. First geeneration. These ADLs primarily focused on modeling architecture elements. Second-Generation: Derived from first-generation architectures, these ADLs emphasize handling dynamic architectures.\nUniCon [93], Wright [94], ACME [95], Rapide [96], SRI SADL [97], C2 ADL [98], and MethaH [99] are considered first-generation and AADL [100], xADL [101], ADML [102], and ArchWare [103] are considered second-generation ADLs [92]. As mentioned above, the ADLs were developed in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s.\nWhile ADLs have gained acceptance in the research community for describing system designs, their adoption in industry remains relatively low. Notable exceptions exist, particularly in the embedded systems domain [91], where ADLs like AADL [100] and EAST-ADL [104] have found success and are widely used in avionics and automotive industries. However, ADLs developed in academia, such as ACME, UniCon, and xADL, have not achieved similar industry adoption [91].\nMost currently used ADLs are either tailored to specific application areas or focus on particular system components, such as system structure. Unfortunately, these ADLs have not scaled well over time [105]. Several existing drawbacks contribute to the limited adoption of ADLs in the industry:\nThe challenges associated with Architectural Description Languages (ADLs) include the lack of robust Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools to support their adoption [105], [106], insufficient mechanisms for enforcing consistent communication styles among stakeholders, limitations in presenting multiple views of architectures [105], [106], inadequate support for tracing requirements [91], restrictive syntax that limits flexibility in real-world applications [91], challenges in scaling to support large applications [91], and inefficient artifact reusability [91]. These challenges collectively contribute to the industry's cautious approach toward adopting ADLs.\nWhile we haven't encountered any specific cases where ADL-type approaches have been used to express and analyze data, ethical, and other concerns, we believe a similar approach could be valuable in constructing and analyzing ethical systems related to data and AI. Hence, it contributes to 6G adoption and development."}, {"title": "E. 6G Software Business Ecosystem", "content": "Research on the 6G ecosystem has increased substantially over the past five years, capturing the interest of both academics and industry [107].

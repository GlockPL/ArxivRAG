From the myths of Talos to Aristotle's logic and Heron's inventions, we have sought to replicate the marvels of the mind. While recent advances in AI hold promise, singular approaches often fall short in capturing the essence of intelligence. This paper explores how fundamental principles from biological computation-particularly context-dependent, hierarchical information processing, trial-and-error heuristics, and multi-scale organization can guide the design of truly intelligent systems. By examining the nuanced mechanisms of biological intelligence, such as top-down causality and adaptive interaction with the environment, we aim to illuminate potential limitations in artificial constructs. Our goal is to provide a framework inspired by biological systems for designing more adaptable and robust artificial intelligent systems.", "sections": [{"title": "HISTORICAL CONTEXT", "content": "The pursuit of artificial intelligence has deep historical roots. Philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, with his mechanical theory of thought, and visionaries such as Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Leibniz ignited the dream of intelligent machines, foreshadowing the notion that intelligence could arise from complex, rule-bound manipulations.\nSubsequent centuries saw renewed efforts to formalize intelligence. Charles Babbage's programmable machines and Ada Lovelace's realization that machines could manipulate symbols-not just numbers-laid the groundwork for modern computation. The 20th century, from formal logic to Alan Turing's foundational work, witnessed the birth of Artificial Intelligence. Despite setbacks, this era produced remarkable successes in specialized tasks; machines achieved impressive feats in chess (IBM DeepBlue19) and Go (AlphaGo93), employing powerful search algorithms that differed significantly from the adaptable, context-sensitive intelligence of biological systems.\nRecent advances in neuroscience and computing power have ignited excitement for neuro-inspired computer vision23. However, the elusive goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains, as the definition of intelligence evolves and benchmarks like the Turing test shift our expectations 71,72. Promising strategies like symbolic computation74 ultimately fell short, possibly due to the lack of a vast knowledge base reflecting real-world understanding69. Neural networks, once met with skepticism, now flourish with increased computational power, yet even the most sophisticated networks still fall short of the adaptive, context-dependent intelligence observed in biological systems.\nThese limitations have prompted researchers to explore alternative paradigms inspired by the adaptability and complexity of biological systems, which we will discuss in the following section."}, {"title": "BIO-INSPIRED AI: CURRENT STATE AND LIMITATIONS", "content": "Biological intelligence, refined through evolutionary processes, offers an alternative paradigm emphasizing adaptability and context sensitivity. Evolution acts as a natural tinkerer45, incrementally building complex systems that flexibly respond to environmental challenges, leading to hierarchically structured architectures that prioritize context-dependent information processing.\nBiological intelligence is not confined to neural systems. Research shows that even single-celled organisms exhibit information processing and adaptive behavior. For instance, Paramecium, a eukaryotic unicellular ciliate, can integrate sensory inputs and modify its behavior accordingly16. Plants also demonstrate sophisticated behaviors like signal transduction and environmental responsiveness without a nervous system, challenging traditional notions of cognition21,104.\nMoreover, life has been navigating various problem spaces-metabolic, transcriptional, physiological, and anatomical-long before nerves and muscles appeared 34,35. This indicates that intelligence predates multicellularity5,6,65 and is rooted in fundamental biological processes. Cells' problem-solving abilities in physiological and metabolic domains enable cell collectives to navigate morphospace an abstract multidimensional space of possible biological forms and functions-by relying on internal molecular pathways and gene-regulatory networks for learning and decision-making11,12,38,40,102.\nThus, a path toward artificial general intelligence involves not merely replicating neural architectures but implementing the multi-scale, hierarchical organization found in life. In such systems, every level-from molecules to cells to organisms-possesses competencies and engages in adaptive information processing, a concept known as \"polycomputing\" 13,60. By embracing this broader view of intelligence, we can explore bio-inspired designs that harness the inherent adaptability and context sensitivity of biological systems.\nRecent years have seen a shift towards bio-inspired designs in developing intelligent machines. Projects like RoboBee66 and RoboRay 78, which mimic insect flight and combine biological with electronic elements, underscore the importance of understanding material constraints for creating flexible, lightweight systems. Effective communication among components and processing power are key to their success. More directly addressing intelligence, neuromorphic computing aims to achieve brain-like energy efficiency with spiking neural network designs36,70. In algorithms, deep learning58 and recurrent networks43 loosely mimic aspects of biological network structure.\nHowever, much of intelligent problem-solving in biology occurs without spiking activity or neurons3,64, challenging the AI focus on neural networks. Intelligence can emerge from different biological substrates and mechanisms. For instance, slime molds like Physarum polycephalum can find the shortest path through a maze to reach food sources, effectively solving complex optimization problems without any neural structures101. Plants exhibit sophisticated behaviors such as opening and closing stomata in response to environmental conditions and adjusting growth patterns toward light sources through hormonal signaling pathways104. Social insects like ants and termites coordinate colony-level activities such as foraging, nest building, and defense through pheromone communication and emergent behaviors, without relying on neuronal processing akin to spiking neurons 18. Even single-celled organisms like bacteria demonstrate chemotaxis and quorum sensing, adjusting their actions based on chemical gradients and population density, reaching optimal census7,99. Remarkably, genetically modified bacteria can act as cell-based biocomputers, solving mathematical problems like identifying prime numbers14.\nThese examples illustrate that intelligence in nature often arises from hierarchical, context-dependent interactions within and between living subsystems at multiple scales not solely from neural computations. They challenge the assumption that replicating neuronal structures is the only path toward artificial intelligence and highlight the potential of alternative biological mechanisms.\nDespite some bio-inspired advances, understanding the computational limits imposed by biological organization remains elusive. Current AI approaches, focused on mimicking \"behavioral function\", often overlook either complex hierarchical architectures or adaptive environmental interactions. This stems from a historical emphasis on functional aspects of intelligence87, where the functional output is paramount but intrinsic organization and external context are secondary. While achieving functionality is desirable, replicating raw computational power incurs high energy costs if we do not understand intrinsic organization and external context.\nEarly attempts to incorporate goal-directed (teleological) behavior via feedback loops offered a path toward adaptation87,94,95. W. Grey Walter's Machina Speculatrix and Machina Docilis tortoises39 could navigate environments using simple sensors, displaying purposeful behaviors. However, purely behavioral approaches failed to advance AI beyond narrow tasks. The missing piece may be the hierarchical organization and multi-scale interactions found in biological systems, enabling context-dependent functional algorithms.\nIn biology, context dependency involves top-down information exchange unique to multi-scale organization107, where higher levels modulate lower-level components75, allowing dynamic adaptation. While information is physical and subject to thermodynamic limits 10,55,56,79,103, biological systems exhibit feedback where macroscopic information influences microscopic dynamics107. This hints at strong causal emergence42, where higher-level properties exert causal powers not reducible to lower-level interactions75.\nFurthermore, biological systems often perform polycomputing the ability of the same substrate to perform multiple computations simultaneously13,60. Unlike traditional computers, living systems components carry out diverse functions concurrently; for example, a protein may participate in metabolism, signal transduction, and structural support. This multifunctionality is a hallmark of biological efficiency and adaptability.\nThis interplay of information and energy allows goal-directed, context-sensitive processing to reconfigure microscopic dynamics. Future quantiative biological models must translate macroscopic goals into computational rules at network, unit (cells), and intracellular scales28. Conventional AI often seeks intelligence emergence from components lacking world models or goal-directed behavior. In contrast, biology exhibits problem solving at every level, with behavior resulting from cooperation and mutual shaping of diverse modules across scales. Every component has homeostatic goal-directedness, and higher levels can modulate the energy landscape of sub-levels to harness autonomy toward larger goals.\nBiological systems also operate within unreliable mediums due to unavoidable noise, forcing them to reinterpret information on-the-fly, prioritizing saliency and real-time adaptation over data fidelity60. This frames information in biology as fundamentally semantic, carrying meaning and purpose, not merely randomness as in Shannon's information theory68,92. Thus, it reflects information's physical nature, offering a framework distinct from the vague \"brain (or cell) is a computer\" analogy28. Biological systems blur the separation of machine and data, as components can modify their structure and function based on information processing.\nWhile bio-inspired AI holds promise, we must be mindful of its limitations. The complexity of biological systems poses challenges in replicating multiple organizational levels. Strictly adhering to biological models risks overfitting;"}, {"title": "CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATIONS FOR BIO-INSPIRED AI", "content": "Biological intelligence relies on context, non-locality, and adaptive feedback. Unlike deterministic algorithms seeking optimal solutions through exhaustive search or predefined rules, biological systems interpret information based on current context. Meaningful information emerges from interactions across multiple scales within a hierarchical architecture, without a direct one-to-one correspondence between microscopic dynamics (e.g., individual neuron activity) and information flow.\nThis framework mirrors gene expression in cells, where DNA functions not as a rigid blueprint but as a dynamic backbone influenced by the cellular environment3,107. Genes interact and respond to external signals, leading to the expression or suppression of certain genes; these interactions, rather than gene products alone, carry information and realize possibilities based on genetic composition68.\nThe key insight is that biological systems do not operate on fixed instructions but adaptively process information based on context. Evolution acts as a natural tinkerer45, incrementally building complex systems that flexibly respond to environmental challenges. This principle has inspired fields like evolutionary robotics, applying evolutionary concepts to robot design and leading to intelligent behaviors differing from those produced by traditional algorithms81. Similarly, within organisms, processes like morphogenesis enable the development of complex structures through context-dependent cellular interactions, while behavioral circuits allow adaptive responses during an organism's lifetime."}, {"title": "Trial and Error as a Fundamental Strategy", "content": "In complex environments, organisms cannot rely on precomputed optimal solutions; instead, they employ heuristics derived from experience, particularly trial-and-error methods, to adapt to new challenges 80,83. This approach enables effective exploration without exhaustive search, favoring adaptability over perfection. Ashby demonstrated that parallel trial-and-error strategies can rapidly solve high-dimensional problems infeasible for serial exhaustive methods1. Similarly, chess masters use experience-based heuristics to focus on promising moves, navigating vast possibilities without calculating every option96. These non-optimal yet effective strategies are characteristic of biological intelligence."}, {"title": "Maintaining Stability Through Hierarchical Organization", "content": "A critical question arises: How does a system exhibiting context-dependent, non-local behavior remain stable? Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety provides an answer2: to effectively control a system or adapt to an environment, the internal control mechanism must possess a variety at least equal to that of the system-environment complex.\nHowever, simply increasing components and connections can lead to instability; Gardner and Ashby showed that excessive connectivity causes chaotic dynamics37. Biological systems address this challenge through modular organization subsystems performing specific functions-maintaining stability while allowing complex behaviors28,67. For example, modules interact but their interactions become fixed over time to ensure consistent functionality20. This modular and hierarchical organization enables robustness and flexibility, allowing systems to adapt without becoming unstable. Moreover, competitive dynamics can shape stable collective information processing, with modules recruited as needed25."}, {"title": "Hierarchy and Information Abstraction", "content": "Evolution has embraced hierarchical organization to build adaptive systems28. Simple organisms exhibit rudimentary behaviors, while more complex ones display intricate behaviors enabled by deeper hierarchical structures like nervous systems. Comparative neuroanatomy across species reveals increasing structural hierarchy alongside more sophisticated behaviors.\nHierarchy involves organizing nested components for information abstraction and efficient processing29, akin to how deep learning networks use multiple layers to extract higher-level features 61. Hierarchical structures facilitate renormalization processes, summarizing detailed lower-level information at higher levels to handle complexity effectively.\nImportantly, hierarchical organization provides modularity, aiding in repair and improvement without disrupting the entire system. Simon's parable of the two watchmakers illustrates this point 94,95: while Tempus builds watches serially (in a non-modular fashion) and must restart upon interruption, Hora uses modules, making the process more efficient and resilient.\nEvolutionary tinkering crafts a modular structure that increases the system's requisite variety as its functional repertoire grows. This principle extends to biological systems and can inform robust AI design. By adopting a modular, hierarchical approach, AI systems can achieve greater adaptability and resilience."}, {"title": "Beyond Deterministic Algorithms", "content": "This understanding challenges attempts to formalize intelligence purely through induction or deterministic algorithms. Bayesian inference, relying on hierarchical generative models and prior assumptions100, cannot achieve the contextual, non-optimal generality of biological intelligence30 due to its reliance on predefined priors, which limits exploration and adaptability. Trial and error, likely the most fundamental knowledge-gathering strategy, underpins even scientific discovery31,82. Complex intelligent behavior arises through continuous interaction with and modification of the environment. Biological systems exemplify this through constant feedback with their surroundings, adjusting behaviors and strategies in real time."}, {"title": "Physical Computing and Compositionality", "content": "The theory of physical computing, grounded in mathematical formalism, enhances our understanding of designing artificial systems that engage with the complexities of natural intelligence.

Studies show that neural development and synaptic connectivity are profoundly influenced by sensorimotor experiences46,76,90, underscoring the need for AI systems that can physically interact with their surroundings to achieve adaptive and context-aware intelligence 81,98.\nThis hints at the embodied Turing test as a more meaningful benchmark for AI. In fact, as discussed earlier, a general problem with the current use of the Turing test is that the goal-post is constantly moved as the definition of the 'target' is reinterpreted whenever a new innovative tool, such as neural networks, surpasses the current threshold72.\nThe embodied Turing test proposes evaluating AI based on its ability to interact physically and adaptively with the world, rather than solely through disembodied tasks like language processing or game playing. This shifts the focus to dynamic, context-dependent interactions that are more representative of natural intelligence. It emphasizes building systems that can sense, act, and adapt to their environments, echoing the evolutionarily honed sensorimotor capabilities of living creatures."}, {"title": "Neuromorphic Efficiency and Adaptability", "content": "Although brain comprises roughly 2% of the body weight, it utilizes about 20% of the body's energy intake84.

Although recent studies indicate that adding perturbations to images can protect them from malicious edits, directly applying image-based methods to perturb each frame in a video becomes ineffective, as video editing techniques leverage the consistency of inter-frame information to restore individually perturbed content. To address this challenge, we leverage the temporal consistency of video content to propose a straightforward and efficient, yet highly effective and broadly applicable approach, Universal Video Consistency Guard (UVCG). UVCG embeds the content of another video(target video) within a protected video by introducing continuous, imperceptible perturbations which has the ability to force the encoder of editing models to map continuous inputs to misaligned continuous outputs, thereby inhibiting the generation of videos consistent with the intended textual prompts. Additionally leveraging similarity in perturbations between adjacent frames, we improve the computational efficiency of perturbation generation by employing a perturbation-reuse strategy. We applied UVCG across various versions of Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) and assessed its effectiveness and generalizability across multiple LDM-based editing pipelines. The results confirm the effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of our approach in safeguarding video content from unauthorized modifications.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Generative technology has attracted considerable attention, especially in image processing, prompting the development of various image generation models[6][10][13][26]. Among these, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) [26] have recently demonstrated notable success in image editing tasks[1][2][34]. Given LDM's superior performance in this domain, several studies have extended its applicability from 2D image editing to the spatiotemporal video editing field[4][19][31]. State-of-the-art open-source video editing models[5][12][31] now allow for the production of realistic, edited videos through the input of concise textual prompts. The emergence of advanced video editing models has made video editing far more efficient and accessible, which was previously a highly demanding task requiring extensive manual effort. While this accessibility enhances user convenience, it also amplifies significant security con-cerns [8], including the potential misuse by malicious actors to manipulate sensitive or harmful video content[9][32]. This could involve the fabrication of videos featuring both public figures and private individuals or the creation of videos intended to deceive, intimidate, or manipulate emotions. Since video serves as a critical source of information, failure to ensure its authenticity exacerbates the challenges of verifying information reliability, posing risks to public trust and security.\nPrevious research has demonstrated that introducing carefully crafted perturbations into images can effectively prevent malicious edits or unauthorized use for artistic style transfer[11][35][16][17]. Similar to image generation protection, an overview of video editing protection is presented in Figure 1. However, research focused on video protection remains limited. An intuitive approach is to adapt image-based protection methods for videos. Unlike images, videos inherently exhibit temporal continuity, with sequential frames combined to convey motion information. To maintain temporal coherence in edited videos, video editing pipelines typically integrate large-scale diffusion models with specialized editing techniques. For instance, Tune-A-Video, proposed by Wu et al. [31], extends the U-Net"}, {"title": "2. Related work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1.

Universal video consistency guard", "content": "In the LDM model, for computational efficiency, an im-age x is transformed into a latent representation z, which is then used to generate a new image( further details on LDM, refer to Appendix 7). Thus, the most straightforward ap-proach is to modify these latent representation so that the model operates on the altered representation z'. In previ-ous work, PRIME[14] apply the image protection methods to each frame of the video and selects different target im-ages for consecutive frames, resulting in inconsistent fea-tures between frames. However, When editing a specific video frame, the editing pipeline often applies global or lo-cal constraints to regulate the content, providing the model with \"correction\u201d capabilities. PRIME's disruption of video content consistency could be \"corrected\" by the global con-straints within the editing pipeline.\nA more effective approach is to align the video with an-other continuous feature space. The key distinction between video editing and image editing lies in the need for video editing to capture not only the features of individual frames but also how these features evolve within the latent space (as indicated by the solid arrows in right-side of Figure 2). To prevent the model from correcting the alterations while compelling it to learn incorrect feature transitions, we in-troduce perturbations into video frames to map the origi-nal latent representations to another set of representations with consistent content. Left-side of Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of our method. Specifically, we select a different video as the target and use the latent represen-tations of the consecutive frames from this target video to guide the perturbation calculation. This method perturbs the original video's latent features to align with those of the target video(alignment process see in Figure 2), leading the editing pipeline recognizing a set of continuous but \"incorrect\" features.\nGiven a video V = [X1,X2,..., xn] to be protected, a target video V = [X1,X2,..., Xm] is selected. Each frame of the target video is encoded into a latent vector representation 2 using the encoder & resulting in a se-quence of latent representations with consistent content: Z = [21, 22,...,2m].

Additionally, 80 editing prompts were designed for each editing model, tailored to their respective strengths in different editing types. These prompts encompass object editing, background modification, and style transformation. Immune Settings. We assume that the attacker's editing pipeline generates high-quality, realistic videos using either the LDM model or a fine-tuned version of it. Regarding the editing pipeline parameters, they are adjusted based on the editing performance on the original video at first, and the same hyperparameters are then used for editing the immu-nized video. Moreover, we assume that the defender has no prior knowledge of the model version used by the at-tacker. Therefore, we implement our immunity approach using publicly available open-source models. Specifically, we utilize the two most popular open-source models: Sta-ble Diffusion v1-4 and Stable Diffusion v2-1.

The optimization process involves 200 steps with a step size of 2/255."}, {"title": "4.2. Qualitative results.", "content": "Protection Effectiveness. We consider the protection suc-cessful under the following two scenarios.

With numerous video editing pipeline and LDM verisons available, tailoring defense mechanisms to each specific editing pipeline would would not achieve truly effective defense. Therefore, immunization methods must demon-strate a certain degree of generalization. Figures 3 and 4 present the visual editing results of videos protected with different LDM versions across various editing pipelines. We could observe that when the base model used by the attacker matches the one employed for video immuniza-tion, the protective visual effect is more pronounced. Fur-thermore, even if the attacker's model differs from the one used during immunization, our protection remains effective. This demonstrates that our immunization approach exhibits strong transferability across different versions of LDMs and various editing pipelines."}, {"title": "4.3.

For each video, we pro-vided three versions: the normally edited video, the video edited after baseline immunity, and the video edited after UVCG. Participants were asked to evaluate the videos based on three criteria: alignment with the textual description, nat-uralness, and inter-frame consistency, rating each video on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 represents the highest qual-ity. Additionally, participants indicated whether they found the two immunity methods effective or not. We collected 15 valid responses. The average evaluation results are pre-sented in Table 2. The following conclusions can be drawn from the results: 1)Existing editing pipelines can generate high-quality edited videos. 2)Random noise-based meth-ods are ineffective in protecting videos. 3)UVCG signifi-cantly degrades video quality, providing robust protection.

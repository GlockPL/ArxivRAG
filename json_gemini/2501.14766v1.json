Introduction", "content": "As biodiversity faces mounting pressures from global environmental change, urban areas present both challenges and opportunities for conservation (Weiskopf et al., 2024). The maintenance of urban biodiversity has become increasingly recognized as fundamental to both ecosystem functioning (Schwarz et al., 2017) and human welfare in cities (Taylor & Hochuli, 2015).\nBalancing urban development with biodiversity conservation is, however, a complex task. The rapid pace of urbanization and associated human activities has exacerbated habitat loss, fragmentation, and the degradation of natural resources (Fraissinet et al., 2023). These pressures, driven by urban growth and densification, particularly over the past few decades, place significant strain on biodiversity and ecosystems (Horv\u00e1th et al., 2019). Urban expansion frequently disrupts key ecological processes such as species movement, reproduction, and genetic exchange, jeopardizing the survival of many species (Donati et al., 2022).\nWhile traditional conservation methods, including habitat restoration and protected areas, remain vital (Aronson et al., 2014), urban environments present unique challenges requiring adaptive strategies that integrate innovation and equity. The unique challenges of urban biodiversity stem from rapid urbanization, fragmented habitats, and anthropogenic disturbances, which demand more adaptive and innovative conservation strategies. (Seto et al., 2012)\nDespite these challenges, urban areas can also serve as valuable sites for biodiversity conservation. Cities often occupy biologically rich regions (Ives et al., 2016) and host unique assemblages of flora and fauna, including rare and threatened species, within mosaics of semi-natural and artificial habitats (Jokim\u00e4ki et al., 2018; M\u00fcller et al., 2013). By strategically planning and managing urban green spaces, cities can support biodiversity while enhancing ecosystem services for urban residents. (Spotswood et al., 2021)\nNature-based Solutions (NBS) have emerged as a promising framework for addressing these challenges, offering multi-benefit ecosystems that can simultaneously support biodiversity while providing environmental, social, and economic benefits (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016), but the growing complexity of urban systems necessitates further innovation, particularly in leveraging cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance biodiversity outcomes.\nThe dynamic and fragmented nature of urban ecosystems requires innovative approaches for effective management. Local-scale planning decisions significantly influence the ecological outcomes of urban development, but these interventions must account for complex socio- ecological interactions (Brown, 2017).\nRecent advances in AI and deep learning offer transformative potential in this regard. Modern technological solutions, especially AI and remote sensing, offer new capabilities for urban biodiversity monitoring and management at unprecedented scales. (Lausch et al., 2015). \u0391\u0399 technologies enhance biodiversity assessment, habitat monitoring, and species preservation while analyzing the complex interactions between technological solutions and traditional conservation approaches (Ditria et al., 2022; Green et al., 2020). These advancements create synergies between innovation and established methods, bridging gaps in urban biodiversity management. For example, Al systems enhance species distribution mapping, corridor identification, and urban ecosystem assessment, enabling evidence-based conservation decisions (He et al., 2015).\nThe rapid advancement of AI capabilities and technologies has enabled its integration across numerous sectors including healthcare, manufacturing, education, public services, marketing and urban development. AI applications are transforming how organizations operate and make decisions (Dwivedi et al., 2021; Sadeghi & Niu, 2024). Recent work by Sadeghi and Niu (2024) demonstrated Al's capacity to address complex systemic challenges in education through a comprehensive framework for ethical implementation and human-AI collaboration. Building on such foundational approaches to AI deployment, urban biodiversity conservation presents unique opportunities where AI's transformative potential lies in its ability to bridge ecological challenges and human demands through real-time data processing, predictive analytics, and innovative modeling frameworks.\nBy using remote sensing data, for instance, AI-powered methods can identify patterns in urban biodiversity and socio-economic variables with remarkable precision (Grafius et al., 2019; Prodanovic et al., 2024). Integrating AI into urban planning processes enables modeling workflows, facilitates effective stakeholder engagement, and provides advanced tools for visualizing project outcomes (Prodanovic et al., 2024). Moreover, Al applications make conservation more effective by addressing both environmental and socio-economic dimensions of urban biodiversity preservation (Kuller et al., 2019; Rega-Brodsky et al., 2022). These tools enable researchers and practitioners to monitor biodiversity dynamics, predict ecological changes, and design evidence-based strategies for urban planning and conservation (Zhou et al., 2023).\nThis study investigates the role of AI in urban biodiversity conservation and management. It explores how AI-driven technologies enhance species detection, habitat modeling, and urban ecosystem analysis, focusing on their applications in monitoring biodiversity, managing invasive species, and optimizing urban green spaces. Specifically, the research examines the integration of Al with traditional conservation methods to address urbanization challenges, such as habitat fragmentation and ecological degradation. Moreover, this study highlights the potential of AI to improve decision-making in urban planning through real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and data-driven insights. By introducing a conceptual framework for Al applications in urban biodiversity management, the research provides practical guidance for policymakers, urban planners, and conservation practitioners. The study aims to bridge the gap between technological advancements and sustainable urban biodiversity strategies, offering insights into supporting resilient and biodiverse urban environments."}, {"title": "2.

Recent advancements highlight deep learning's effectiveness in improving the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of monitoring across various taxa and environments.\nIn urban wildlife monitoring, deep learning models have achieved notable success in detecting and managing animal populations. For instance, the Swin-Mask R-CNN with SAHI model developed for feral pigeon detection in Hong Kong significantly improved monitoring precision. By utilizing Swin Transformers for feature extraction and the SAHI tool for small object detection, the model achieved a 10% precision improvement, providing a scalable solution for automated wildlife monitoring (Guo et al., 2024).\nIn vegetation monitoring, AI-based approaches have advanced urban flora mapping. A multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for tree species mapping in Rio de Janeiro achieved high classification accuracy, with F1-scores of 79.3% for nine species and 87.6% for five dominant species. This method addressed challenges such as overlapping canopies and tree trait variability, providing valuable tools for urban forest management and green infrastructure planning (Martins et al., 2021). In invasive species management, combining UAV imagery with the DeepLabv3+ model successfully monitored the invasive aquatic plant Pistia stratiotes in urban water bodies, achieving 90.24% accuracy. This enabled early detection and intervention in dynamic aquatic ecosystems, despite challenges like vegetation occlusion and environmental variability (Hao et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "2.2 Urban Ecosystem Analysis and Planning", "content": "The integration of AI and advanced technologies has transformed urban ecosystem analysis and planning, providing innovative solutions to balance urban development with biodiversity conservation amid challenges like habitat fragmentation, pollution, and climate change.\nGIS-based tools like the Habitat Network Analysis Tool (HNAT) automate habitat network analyses to predict species distribution and assess functionality. Tested in Gothenburg, Sweden, HNAT integrated habitat quality and connectivity data, identifying areas for restoration to improve amphibian habitats while incorporating factors like road networks and traffic for effective biodiversity planning (Kindvall et al., 2024).\nAl-driven remote sensing technologies, including NDVI, satellite imagery, and LiDAR, have enhanced large-scale urban vegetation and biodiversity mapping. The ECO-LENS project used these tools with machine learning to analyze NDVI trends in 65 cities, linking state-level policies to vegetation coverage and supporting collaborative conservation efforts, despite challenges like data labeling and NDVI's species-specific limitations (Montas, 2024).\nAI also optimizes green space management through systems like the \"Green Space Optimizer,\" which combines real-time environmental data and predictive analytics to support biodiversity, water conservation, and community engagement. Its ability to mitigate urban heat island effects and improve carbon footprints makes it a global benchmark for urban park management (Patil et al., 2024).\nCitizen science and clustering further enhance biodiversity planning. In Athens, Greece, a k-means clustering approach combined remote sensing data with citizen science observations from GBIF, classifying urban habitats at the zipcode level to identify biodiversity hotspots and emphasize green infrastructure in planning. This replicable framework highlights public engagement's value in conservation (Ziliaskopoulos & Laspidou, 2024).\nThese advancements demonstrate AI's transformative potential in urban ecosystem analysis and planning by integrating GIS, remote sensing, machine learning, and citizen science to create sustainable, resilient urban environments."}, {"title": "2.3 Environmental Acoustics and Soundscape Analysis", "content": "Environmental acoustics and soundscape analysis, using tools like eco-acoustic indices, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), and machine learning, offer non-invasive and scalable methods to monitor species diversity, habitat quality, and human impact on urban ecosystems.\nIn their study, Latifi et al. (2023) showed the effectiveness of eco-acoustic indices\u2014Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Bioacoustics Index (BI), and Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI)\u2014in assessing bird biodiversity in Isfahan, Iran. Specifically, parks with less noise and better vegetation, such as Soffeh Park, showed higher bird species richness and activity. Through their analysis, machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) predicted biodiversity indices with high accuracy, with SVM achieving R\u00b2 values of 0.93 for songbird richness and 0.92 for evenness. Taken together, these results highlight the value of acoustic monitoring and thoughtful park design in enhancing urban habitat quality.\nBuilding on these acoustic monitoring advances, Zhang et al. (2023) used deep learning to classify acoustic scenes in Guangzhou's urban forests, analyzing seven sound categories, including human and animal sounds. In their implementation, the DenseNet_BC_34 model achieved 93.81% accuracy, with mel spectrograms effectively capturing temporal and spectral features. However, challenges like misclassification in mixed soundscapes due to overlapping features emphasized the need for diverse training datasets. Ultimately, this study showcases deep learning's role in advancing passive acoustic monitoring for urban biodiversity research."}, {"title": "2.4 Species Distribution and Habitat Modeling", "content": "Al-driven species distribution and habitat modeling has become a key tool in urban biodiversity research, providing precise methods to assess species-environment interactions using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Earth Observation (EO) data, and machine learning. For instance, Zheng et al. (2024) used GIS and machine learning to assess urbanization's impact on bobcat habitats in San Jose, California. Their innovative Habitat Suitability Model (HSM) integrated vegetation cover, water distribution, road traffic, and intersection density to identify critical conservation areas. Through detailed analysis, the study found that while vegetation and water bodies improved habitat suitability, proximity to busy roads diminished it, ultimately emphasizing the need for wildlife crossings to enhance connectivity and reduce roadkill. This comprehensive framework informs local wildlife strategies and broader urban ecological challenges.\nSimilarly focusing on urban habitats, Wellmann et al. (2020) used high-resolution EO data and machine learning to model habitats for 44 bird species in Leipzig, Germany, achieving accuracies of 59-90%. Notably, continuous vegetation indicators, such as density and texture metrics, outperformed traditional indices like NDVI in predicting habitat suitability. By combining individual Species Distribution Models (SDMs), they successfully mapped urban bird species richness, thereby offering guidance for optimizing urban green spaces to support biodiversity.\nExpanding on these findings, Zhai et al. (2024) analyzed spatiotemporal bird species richness patterns in Beijing, linking urbanization, seasonal changes, and environmental factors using algorithms like Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Their research revealed that key predictors included water bodies, green space area, relative humidity, and nighttime light pollution. Most significantly, suburban areas with blue-green infrastructure saw increased diversity, while core urban areas experienced declines, further underscoring the importance of integrating blue- green networks into urban planning.\nFinally, complementing these urban studies, Zheran et al. (2020) demonstrated EO-based SDMs' scalability in urban avifauna assessment. Through their methodological approach linking spectral vegetation traits and vegetation heterogeneity to bird behaviors, they developed a cost-effective framework for modeling species richness and supporting urban biodiversity management."}, {"title": "2.5 Conservation Planning and Management", "content": "AI applications in conservation planning have transformed biodiversity protection, invasive species management, and urban forest enhancement by leveraging machine learning, remote sensing, and advanced analytics.\nSilvestro et al.

CAPTAIN outperformed traditional tools like Marxan, achieving up to 18.5% lower species loss under budget constraints. By integrating real- time biodiversity data, anthropogenic disturbance metrics, and climate change projections, CAPTAIN achieved conservation targets in 68% of simulations for Madagascar's endemic trees, compared to Marxan's 2%, demonstrating its efficiency in balancing diverse conservation goals.\nFor invasive species management, Dutta et al. (2020) applied ResNet-18, a deep learning model, to detect Elaeagnus umbellata in urban parks. With over 96% accuracy across datasets from eight parks, the model's scalability enables dynamic monitoring and resource-efficient mitigation in metropolitan areas, offering critical guidance for targeted invasive species control.\nIn urban forestry, Louis et al. (2022) used machine learning techniques like PCA and boosting regression to analyze tree biodiversity along Hong Kong's San Tin Highway. Slopes supported higher biodiversity than verges dominated by Corymbia citriodora, with slope height and area as key predictors of biodiversity. This approach provided strategies to balance biodiversity enhancement with safety concerns, such as wildlife-vehicle collisions and risks from tall trees.\nThese studies illustrate how AI-driven tools optimize resource use, improve biodiversity outcomes, and offer adaptive strategies to address urbanization and ecological challenges."}, {"title": "2.6 Urban Environmental Change Analysis", "content": "AI applications in urban environmental change analysis integrate machine learning, remote sensing, and IoT technologies to monitor, model, and manage urbanization's impact on biodiversity, offering actionable insights for conservation and sustainable urban development.

By combining IoT sensors with machine learning models like General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR), the study achieved highly accurate predictions of water quality parameters, with errors below 0.2 mg/L. This cost-effective approach facilitates efficient monitoring and pollutant management, highlighting AI's role in safeguarding aquatic ecosystems.\nFurthermore, Eyster et al. (2024) analyzed a 26% decline in bird abundance in Metro Vancouver from 1997 to 2020 using deep learning models to classify landcover changes. Notably, habitat measured at species-specific scales better explained temporal population changes, though broader drivers like climate change and arthropod declines also contributed. This comprehensive study underscores the importance of multiscale ecological assessments and habitat restoration to mitigate biodiversity loss.\nSimilarly, in the context of urban forestry, Elmes et al. (2018) addressed urban tree mortality in Worcester, MA, using Conditional Inference Trees (CIT) to identify socioeconomic and biophysical predictors in a replanting program. Their analysis revealed that factors such as renter occupancy, impervious surfaces, and property characteristics influenced tree survival, ultimately emphasizing the integration of socioeconomic variables into urban forestry strategies to enhance survivorship and ecosystem services."}, {"title": "3. AI-Driven Framework for Biodiversity Conservation and Management", "content": "The AI-Driven Framework for Biodiversity Conservation and Management (Fig. 1) provides a systematic approach to integrating AI technologies into conservation efforts through five hierarchical layers, transforming data into actionable outcomes. At the top, the AI Technologies & Tools Layer acts as the technological foundation guiding the framework. In designing this hierarchical framework, we drew inspiration from recent advances in Al implementation frameworks across different domains. Notably, Sadeghi and Niu (2024) established key principles for responsible Al deployment in complex social systems, emphasizing data standardization, ethical considerations, and the critical balance between automation and human oversight. These foundational concepts informed our approach to integrating Al in biodiversity conservation, particularly in ensuring equitable access to technology and maintaining transparency in decision- making processes.\nThe Data Management Layer incorporates five key data streams\u2014Remote Sensing, Environmental Sensors, Acoustic Monitoring, Citizen Science, and Historical Records\u2014to ensure comprehensive biodiversity indicators across scales. Building on this, the Analysis & Modeling Layer applies advanced tools such as Species Detection, Habitat Suitability Modeling, Ecosystem Service Assessment, Risk Analysis, and Predictive Modeling to generate insights into ecosystem dynamics and species populations.\nInsights from analysis are operationalized in the Implementation & Monitoring Layer through Real-time Monitoring, Adaptive Management, Conservation Planning, and Impact Assessment, bridging analysis and action for data-driven, practical conservation. Finally, the Outcomes Layer focuses on four objectives: Enhanced Biodiversity, Ecosystem Resilience, Sustainable Urban Development, and Evidence-based Policy Making.\nThe framework functions as an integrated system, with sequential information flow and feedback loops enabling continuous refinement of strategies. This structured approach ensures Al is effectively leveraged to address biodiversity challenges while providing clear pathways for implementation and evaluation. It serves as both a practical guide for conservation managers and a conceptual model for researchers, emphasizing Al's transformative role in achieving conservation goals and sustainable ecosystem management."}, {"title": "4. Opportunities and Challenges in AI-Driven Urban Biodiversity Management", "content": "The integration of AI technologies in urban biodiversity conservation presents both significant opportunities and complex challenges that must be carefully considered. The rapid advancement of AI tools, particularly in species detection, habitat modeling, and environmental monitoring, has created unprecedented possibilities for understanding and protecting urban ecosystems. However, these opportunities are accompanied by substantial technical, ethical, and socioeconomic challenges that require thoughtful consideration and strategic solutions.\nRemote sensing and AI-powered monitoring systems have demonstrated remarkable potential for scalable, cost-effective biodiversity assessment. As evidenced by studies like Guo et al. (2024), Al models can achieve detection accuracies exceeding 74% for urban wildlife, while maintaining real-time monitoring capabilities that were previously impossible with traditional methods. The integration of multiple data sources, including acoustic monitoring, satellite imagery, and citizen science observations, has enabled comprehensive ecosystem analysis at unprecedented scales. This scalability is particularly valuable in urban environments where rapid environmental changes demand continuous monitoring and adaptive management strategies.\nThe potential for integration with nature-based solutions (NBS) represents another significant opportunity. Al tools can optimize the design and implementation of green infrastructure, as demonstrated by the \"Green Space Optimizer\" system, which enhances urban park management for biodiversity while addressing climate resilience. These technologies enable precise targeting of conservation efforts, allowing cities to maximize biodiversity benefits within limited urban spaces while simultaneously addressing challenges like the urban heat island effect and carbon footprint reduction.\nHowever, several critical challenges must be addressed. Data quality and availability remain persistent concerns, particularly in developing urban areas. The effectiveness of Al models depends heavily on comprehensive, high-quality training data, which is often lacking for many urban species and ecosystems. Privacy concerns also emerge when monitoring systems collect data in populated areas, requiring careful consideration of data governance and protection frameworks.\nEthical considerations and potential biases in AI models present another significant challenge. As highlighted by studies in species distribution modeling, Al systems may inherit biases from training data, potentially overlooking rare species or underrepresenting certain urban habitats. These biases can lead to skewed conservation priorities and ineffective management strategies if not properly addressed. The challenge of ensuring fair and equitable representation of different urban ecosystems in AI-driven decision-making processes requires ongoing attention and mitigation strategies.\nSocioeconomic disparities in technology adoption and implementation pose additional challenges. While advanced AI tools offer powerful capabilities for biodiversity management, their deployment often requires significant technical expertise and financial resources. This disparity can lead to uneven implementation across different urban areas, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in urban biodiversity conservation. Studies like Louis et al. (2022) highlight how socioeconomic factors significantly influence the success of urban greening initiatives, emphasizing the need for inclusive approaches to technology deployment.\nLooking forward, addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach. Investment in comprehensive data collection systems, development of standardized protocols for Al model validation, and establishment of clear ethical guidelines for urban biodiversity monitoring are essential steps. Additionally, promoting partnerships between research institutions, local governments, and community organizations can help bridge the technology gap and ensure more equitable access to Al-driven conservation tools. Success in urban biodiversity conservation ultimately depends on balancing the transformative potential of AI technologies with careful consideration of their limitations and societal implications."}, {"title": "5. Policy Implications and Recommendations", "content": "The integration of AI technologies in urban biodiversity conservation requires thoughtful policy frameworks to ensure effective and equitable outcomes (Guilherme et al., 2024); Rega-Brodsky et al., 2022). Based on the evidence presented, several key recommendations emerge for policymakers, urban planners, and conservation managers.\nInvesting in AI-driven biodiversity tools is a critical policy priority. Successful implementations like CAPTAIN (Silvestro et al., 2022) and AloT water quality systems (Wang et al., 2022) demonstrate Al's ability to enhance conservation outcomes while optimizing resources. Policymakers should establish funding mechanisms for developing, piloting, and scaling AI tools, as evidenced by the Habitat Network Analysis Tool (HNAT) in Gothenburg, which yielded significant benefits for biodiversity planning (Kindvall et al., 2024).\nThe implementation of AI in biodiversity conservation raises critical questions about stakeholder engagement and system transparency. Research on AI implementation highlights that successful adoption relies on clear communication and inclusive stakeholder involvement (Sadeghi, 2024). In urban biodiversity contexts, this principle underscores the importance of emphasizing transparency about AI systems, particularly when engaging community groups, local organizations, and citizen scientists. Transparent communication improves trust and mitigates resistance to technological change, and ensures equitable participation in conservation efforts. For instance, studies in Athens demonstrated that meaningful community engagement in AI-driven biodiversity monitoring significantly improved the identification of biodiversity hotspots (Ziliaskopoulos & Laspidou, 2024).\nEnsuring equitable access to AI technologies is crucial for inclusive biodiversity management. Policies must address the digital divide by building local capacity, providing technical training, and supporting technology adoption in underserved areas. In addressing the complexities of resource allocation for biodiversity projects, methodologies like the Sustainable, Robust, Resilient, and Risk-averse Budget Allocation for Projects (S3RBAP) framework (Lotfi et al., 2024) provide valuable insights. By incorporating risk mitigation, resiliency, and sustainability, such approaches can inform budget allocation strategies that balance ecological goals with stakeholder needs and resource constraints in urban biodiversity conservation. Studies in Worcester, MA, highlight how socioeconomic factors influence tree survival and conservation outcomes, underscoring the need for equity-focused technology deployment (Elmes et al., 2018).\nBalancing conservation with urban development requires integrating biodiversity data into planning processes. Research on bobcat habitats in San Jose (Zheng et al., 2024) and bird distribution in Leipzig (Wellmann et al., 2020) emphasizes the importance of using AI-driven tools to guide urban planning while prioritizing ecological sustainability.\nThese strategies underscore the importance of AI in shaping policies that protect biodiversity, support urban sustainability, and promote equitable access to conservation technologies. The findings highlight the importance of ethical Al principles, as outlined by Sadeghi and Niu (2024), in promoting equitable and transparent conservation practices. This includes developing policies that:\n\u2022\tMandate biodiversity impact assessments using Al-powered monitoring systems, following successful models like the DeepLabv3+ implementation (Hao et al., 2024)\n\u2022\tEstablish minimum requirements for green space preservation based on AI-derived habitat modeling (Wellmann et al., 2020)\n\u2022\tCreate incentives for developers to incorporate biodiversity-friendly design elements, informed by studies like Louis et al. (2022) on urban forestry\n\u2022\tSet clear metrics for measuring and monitoring conservation outcomes using advanced monitoring systems like those developed by Guo et al. (2024)\nTo implement these recommendations effectively, several specific policy actions are proposed, drawing from successful implementations documented in recent research:\n1. Establish a dedicated urban biodiversity technology fund to support Al tool development and deployment, following models that have shown success in species monitoring (Martins et al., 2021)\n2. Create regulatory frameworks for standardized data collection and sharing protocols, building on experiences from successful acoustic monitoring programs (Zhang et al., 2023)\n3. Develop certification programs for Al-powered biodiversity assessment tools, incorporating lessons from successful implementations like the ECO-LENS project (Montas, 2024)\n4. Implement mandatory biodiversity monitoring requirements for urban development projects, informed by successful models like those studied by Eyster et al. (2024)\n5. Create incentive programs for private sector investment in biodiversity conservation technology, following successful examples of public-private partnerships (Latifi et al., 2023)\nThe success of these policy recommendations relies on sustained commitment and coordinated action across governance levels, as shown by successful urban biodiversity initiatives (Cohen- Shacham, 2016; Spotswood et al., 2021). Regular evaluation and adaptation based on monitoring outcomes and emerging technologies will be key to long-term effectiveness. Policies must also emphasize transparent decision-making and meaningful community engagement in conservation planning, as advocated by Brown (2017) and Rega-Brodsky et al. (2022).\nAs urban areas expand under increasing environmental pressures, these recommendations provide a framework for leveraging AI to enhance biodiversity conservation while promoting sustainable urban development. Integrating nature-based solutions and sustainable urban planning with AI frameworks highlights the value of combining technological innovation with holistic approaches to achieve ecological, social, and economic sustainability (Kabisch et al., 2016; (Tzoulas et al., 2007). The future of urban biodiversity conservation depends on combining AI tools with established practices to address urban-specific challenges. Effective implementation requires careful consideration of local contexts, resources, and policy frameworks to ensure equitable and impactful outcomes."}, {"title": "6.

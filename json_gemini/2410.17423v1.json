{"title": "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN BRAZILIAN NEWS: A MIXED-METHODS ANALYSIS", "authors": ["Raphael Hernandes", "Giulio Corsi"], "abstract": "The current surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) interest, reflected in heightened media coverage since 2009, has sparked significant debate on AI's implications for privacy, social justice, workers' rights, and democracy. The media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception and acceptance of AI technologies. However, research into how AI appears in media has primarily focused on anglophone contexts, leaving a gap in understanding how Al is represented globally. This study addresses this gap by analyzing 3,560 news articles from Brazilian media published between July 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024, from 13 popular online news outlets. Using Computational Grounded Theory (CGT), the study applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), BERTopic, and Named-Entity Recognition to investigate the main topics in AI coverage and the entities represented. The findings reveal that Brazilian news coverage of AI is dominated by topics related to applications in the workplace and product launches, with limited space for societal concerns, which mostly focus on deepfakes and electoral integrity. The analysis also highlights a significant presence of industry-related entities, indicating a strong influence of corporate agendas in the country's news. This study underscores the need for a more critical and nuanced discussion of Al's societal impacts in Brazilian media.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) hype is at an unprecedented level [1]. This keen interest reflects and is reflected in the news. In The New York Times, for example, there has been increased AI coverage since 2009 [2, p. 964]. Journalism reacts to readers' attention to a topic but also sets the agenda of public debate [3]-[5].\nAl comes with concerns about its impacts on privacy, social justice, workers' rights, and democracy. The discourse about AI in media, fiction or non-fiction, helps set public perception, acceptance, expectations, and how the technology will be implemented [6, pp. 5\u20136, 7, 8]. Given its importance, researchers have analyzed how Al appears in different mediums and the effects these portrayals have [6], [9]\u2013[12].\nNews coverage of AI, however, remains underexplored [12], as are studies exploring AI representation beyond the anglophone world [10, p. 5]. Looking into different locations is crucial, as the attitudes towards AI and its coverage vary around the globe [10, p. 4, 13]. Hence, this study addresses both gaps by bringing new empirical evidence about how AI is covered in Brazilian news.\nBrazil is the largest Portuguese-speaking country and is situated in the Global South, providing an inter- esting focus of study beyond the anglophone tradition. This is supported by its unique history of rapid technological adoption in the 2000s [14, pp. 169\u2013170], and digital platforms' strong influence in the country's democracy [15], [16]."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "2.1 AI in Media and Public Interest\nMost of the analysis of AI Narratives focuses on the English-speaking world, while narratives\u2014and their impacts-from the Global North might not be the same in the Global South, as ideas surrounding the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" vary across cultures and languages [10, p. 4, 28]. While some transnational similarities can be seen, which might come from having similar economic development and political systems, there is no single shared imaginary of AI. Local concerns around AI vary, and the news in different countries display both utopian and dystopian narratives [13].\nNarratives about AI might not accurately reflect its state. These imaginings are interpreted by researchers and regulators and can lead to wrong notions of AI [6, p. 5]. AI Narratives have the power to shape the development of the technology [10, pp. 5, 7, 8]. For example, framing related to a \"race\" in AI development might lead to actors overlooking safety precautions [9, p. 2].\nThis kind of power makes it valuable for different stakeholders to try to control these narratives to suit their interests, and tech companies invest resources to foster public acceptance of AI [6, p. 6]. These efforts are reflected in the media. An analysis of six mainstream outlets in the United Kingdom shows that industry leads the debate in the news over academic studies or political speeches. As a result, UK news often fails to acknowledge some of the concerns about AI. It is presented as a solution for societal problems (such as cancer and renewable energy), and journalists rarely question whether that is the case [12, pp. 1\u20134]. This representation might lead to expectations over what Brennen, Howard, and Nielsen [7, p. 24] describe as pseudo-artificial general intelligence (alluding to a hypothesized system that can mimic human intelligence), by overestimating the capacity of the technology and neglecting its costs and risks. Another analysis on the UK pointed to a tendency to use a sensationalistic tone in headlines, oscillating between optimistic solutionism and warnings of systemic dangers [29].\nThe optimistic tone is influenced by the sources quoted in the articles [7, p. 29]. By often listening to experts who support AI, for instance, Canadian media reduces the controversiality of representations of this area's future from the coverage. These experts also displayed a tendency to frame Al's controversial topics in favor of the institutions for which they spoke [30, pp. 3\u20134]. This speaks to the importance of analyzing the entities"}, {"title": "2.2 Science and Technology Journalism", "content": "Science journalism has been widely analyzed in literature and may provide a valuable background for understanding the conditions of producing technology-related news. It is similar to tech journalism for disseminating new, often technical, findings. Works about AI [12, pp. 2, 8] and about science journalism in Brazil that refer to news outlets' \"Science and Tech\" sections [35].\nPart of the increased AI itch can only be scratched by S&T journalism, especially in the Global South, given its lack of alternative science communication platforms, such as science museums, cafes, and exhibitions [36, pp. 2, 12]. However, specialist reporters are expensive and, thus, rare in newsrooms as the overall number of journalists is in decline [37, pp. 15\u201316]. Those who keep their jobs in this environment are pressured to increase their content output, diminishing quality [38, p. 50]. In Brazil, the journalism industry faces financial struggles, which led to layoffs and worse working conditions, especially since the 2010s [39]. These struggles are known to other countries in the Global South and lead to generalist reporters being assigned to write about these complex subjects, resulting in less critical output [36, p. 9]."}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": "3.1 Analyzing texts with computational methods\nComputational methods provide an effective way of analyzing trends in large quantities of texts. In a news media context, these have been explored to study biases [24, pp. 394\u2013395, 40]. By grouping articles based on their word choices (document clustering), researchers can identify the different topics or themes in the corpus, which has been used to spot the main themes in news about an issue on the news [24, p. 397, 22]."}, {"title": "3.2 Data Analysis", "content": "The analysis queried relevant Brazilian collec- tions on Media Cloud7 [34] for texts mention- ing \"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\" published be- tween July 1st, 2023, and February 29th, 2024. They were then filtered only to contain data from a sample of 13 news outlets, curated to include popular outlets that published about Al regularly and that had different character- istics. A list of outlets and classifications is available in Appendix A. This granted an ini- tial dataset of 7,514 texts. After filtering only texts in which AI was central (Section 3.3), the analysis ran on 3,560 texts, described in Ap- pendix C.\n\"Artificial Intelligence\" was deemed a relevant keyword as it is an umbrella term for multiple applications in the realm of automating func- tions of the human brain [6, p. 4]. Mentions of this term in media capture its different con- texts. Similar research has also investigated broader keyword lists [11, p. 390]. However, under the scope of this study, using additional terms would add complexity without bringing relevant insight. Expanding search terms in Media Cloud's set of 167 national media sources for Brazil to include \"ROBOTS\", \"deep learning\", and \"machine learning\" adds 107 texts to the 15,307 initially found.\nAdditional information for the relevant texts was gathered using the news-please Python library [41]. A full description of the texts' preprocessing is available in Appendix D."}, {"title": "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)", "content": "The texts were initially processed using LDA. This approach is used to discover topics in large textual datasets in journalism research [23, p. 85, 24, p. 398]. This study used LDA modeling from the Gensim library in Python [18]. Optimal values for the alpha and eta hyperparameters were found through a grid search for maximizing coherence using cv, the best-performing metric to analyze LDA coherence [43, p. 406]. Alpha was set to 0.1 and eta to 1, allowing for different levels of topic prevalence across documents [42]. cv was also used to identify optimal passes and iterations10, set to 30 and 300, respectively.\nThe number of topics (k) was also defined to maximize coherence. Every number between 8 and 20 (Figure 2) was tested with the optimal hyperparameters. Other k values were tested previously under different settings, including values between 2 and 7, 30, and 50, but those never yielded relevant results.\nThe highest coherence score (c\u2081 = 0.5913) was met with 19 topics, and these made sense regarding human interpretability. The modeling filtered out words that appeared too often in the corpus (over 95% of texts) and too rarely (less than two texts). This led to the absence of the term \"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\" from the topics since it features in every article."}, {"title": "Deep reading", "content": "The findings from the first step were validated by a computationally guided deep reading, in which the 10 most representative texts for each identified topic were qualitatively analyzed [17, p. 25]. Representativeness is based on the proportion of words in the text that are strongly associated with the topic according to the LDA model [17, pp. 25\u201326]."}, {"title": "BERTopic and Named-Entity Recognition (NER)", "content": "Results were validated with a more sophisticated unsupervised machine learning topic modeling with BERTopic [19]. It was set to infer the topic division, provided that each bucket included at least 40 texts, leading to 17 topics, including a special '-1' category, a catch-all for less confidently classified documents. The process was supported by a BERT model trained in Portuguese [45], [46].\nFor NER, Python's Spacy library was used along with pt_core_news_lg, its best-performing pipeline for this task in Portuguese [47]. This identified people, places, and institutions in the corpus."}, {"title": "3.3 Filtering relevant content", "content": "A text mentioning AI does not make it about AI. Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) was used to spot articles in which AI was a relevant term [48, pp. 516\u2013517]. TF-IDF was applied to generate the weight of \"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\" in each text. Then, the corpus was filtered to remove the content that fell below the median of this score. The median proved to be the best threshold after manual inspection, as it was the lowest value to include only texts in which AI was a central topic. Articles that cited AI in the title were included regardless of their TF-IDF score."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "4.1 RQ1: Main topics in Brazilian news about AI\n4.1.1 Word Count Analysis\nWord Count and N-Gram analyses show the prominence of terms related to the private sector (industry) such as \"COMPANY,\" \"Google,\" and \"ChatGPT.\" Other common words in the AI lexicon, like \"MODEL\", \"DATA\", and \"TOOL\", also appear. A list of the ten most frequent words is available in Appendix E.\nN-Gram analysis\u00b9\u00b9, in parts, reflect the topics that drove the days with most AI-related stories published (Section 4.1.3). Interestingly, however, the most common four-gram is \"The New York Times\" with 119 mentions. These appear under different contexts, some as the object of stories about the newspaper's lawsuit against OpenAI [49], others have it as the source of the stories, both from its licensing service and from texts that mention their coverage. \"UNITED STATES\" is also often cited, reinforcing the international aspect of this coverage."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Topic Modelling", "content": "The LDA analysis divided the content into 19 topics. Four of those can be excluded as they include too few texts to be considered (n < 12). They refer to very specific cases, such as coverage of a podcast series published by Canaltech, one of the analyzed sources. The remaining 15 can then be grouped into 4 larger categories: Culture, Economy, Products, and Society (Table 1). These were identified after an analysis of how the topics could be clustered during the deep reading stage, considering their overarching themes and news sections in which they would fit.\nThe topic distribution is not uniform (Figure 3). Topic 17, related to AI's usage at work, is the most popular overall and ranks high in every media type category. It is least present in tech publications (where it still ranks second). Tech media drives the coverage of products. Topic 7, related to the use of AI in the elections (the most prominently covered local AI issue), was only barely present in the two tech publications this analysis focused on, while that was the third most relevant issue for online and legacy media. Unsurprisingly, finance-related news makes up most of the business media's coverage."}, {"title": "Products", "content": "The second largest topic overall, 13, includes announcements of new products and features, explanations about how to use AI tools, and which tool to use in different situations. These explanations are connected to the launches themselves. For example, on February 13th, 2024, Canaltech published an explainer about Google Gemini [52], the chatbot launched a few days earlier to replace Bard [53].\nTopic 4 relates to the launches of computer processors or laptops. Topic 2 mentions the launch of smartphones described by their makers as having AI functionalities (for editing pictures, for example). Al capabilities are sometimes vaguely mentioned without explaining what they are."}, {"title": "Society", "content": "Most topics in this category show a concern around deepfakes12. Topic 12 encapsulates AI's ethical dilemmas and its potential for wrongdoings when generating fake images. These include testimonies of people who saw their faces in forged videos used for scams, the usage of AI to bring back images and voices of late artists, and a TikTok trend of generating gruesome videos of kids. Most texts analyzed in this category were originally published by BBC World Service.\nThe largest topic in the Society category, 7, focuses on the legal debate, mainly relating to using AI during Brazil's (then upcoming) 2024 elections. Most content is driven by the rules defined by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE), which required candidates to be transparent about their AI usage and banned deepfakes and chatbots that communicate directly with voters [54]. Topic 7 also includes articles about bills in Congress to regulate AI, again focusing on deepfakes.\nTopic 6 relates to school students who used AI to make pornographic deepfakes of their colleagues. Most texts refer to a case that happened in Rio. A similar episode happened in the state of Pernambuco a few days later, so the topic continued to be covered.\nTopic 18 relates to AI in healthcare and adopts an optimistic tone. Its texts focus on the repercussions of research on using AI for supporting diagnostics or preventing illnesses."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Timeline", "content": "Science coverage adheres to the journalistic structure and norms, making it episodic (i.e., mostly based on events) [37, p. 19, 36, p. 8]. This motivates an analysis of the output of AI content in Brazilian news over time to investigate whether specific events drove increased activity. The data indicates this is the case, supporting a pattern spotted in topic modeling (Section 4.1.2).\nAn analysis of pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients (r) on the number of texts published daily by the ten most frequent outlets in the corpus shows a positive relationship in every case with a statistically significant relationship (Pearson's r range: .374 to .727). This points to increased activity periods being shared among outlets, a pattern consistent with episodic behavior. When an event happens, various outlets react to it, leading to an uptick."}, {"title": "4.1.4 Similar topic patterns in BERTopic", "content": "While the size of the topics varies, BERTopic's output can be arranged in a similar category structure to LDA's, which helps confirm some of its findings. These include topics for new products and how-tos, work-related news, elections, finance, and deepfakes (Figure 7). An Adjusted Rand Index14 score of 0.4475 indicates a moderate agreement between the topic assignments from LDA and BERTopic.\nArtists and International BERTopic picks up on two additional themes in the corpus. Its Topic 4 includes news about the use of Elis Regina's image, a Brazilian singer who died in 1982, being reproduced with AI in an ad, and other news about using AI to reproduce singers' voices. News about the international A\u0399 landscape, including the US and China relations and AI regulation, appears in Topic 6."}, {"title": "4.2 RQ2: Sources represented in Brazilian news about AI", "content": "NER analysis confirms the prevalence of industry-related actors in the stories, as seen in topic modeling and deep reading. Fifteen of the Top 20 entities in the documents relate to big tech companies.\nLooking into these entities' popularity over time helps ensure that their position in the rankings results from a pattern rather than a spike in coverage. There are moments of increased mentions for some, such as when Altman was ousted from OpenAI, but most appear widely throughout the period."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The main topics and entities mentioned in news coverage shed light on the sources of information and the actors shaping the discourse. Overall, the topic distribution reveals a focus on Al products, in the workplace and elsewhere, over deeper discussions of their implications for society, policy, or ethics. While there is coverage of topics like elections and healthcare, these are overshadowed by content related to new AI features, product launches, and corporate developments. This pattern suggests a prioritization of technological advancement and its immediate applications. This is similar to Canada, where AI is often covered in business news and with an optimistic tone [31, pp. 10\u201311].\nIn Brazil, technology is connected to recent menaces to the country's democracy, especially between 2012 and 2022, with the use of disinformation online to cast doubt on the elections' integrity, promote radicalization, erode trust in media and democratic institutions, and harm political actors' reputations [15], [16]. Much of the news with a local flavor is related to deepfakes with a regulatory and elections lens, and the analysis highlights the importance of elections in the Brazilian AI debate, reflecting a unique scenario. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) has been at the forefront of tech regulation in the country, as bills on the matter have not progressed in Congress, and relevant cases in the Supreme Court are still awaiting judgment. It is up to TSE to delve into technological progress since elections happen every two years and, thus, cannot wait for the other institutions' rulings [55].\nIn some ways, Brazilian AI coverage echoes that from abroad. This is shown by The New York Times's popularity and by texts reproduced from the BBC dominating one of the LDA topics. While understandable, given the financial constraints of the news organizations and the fact that most AI development happens away from Brazil, heavy reliance on foreign sources in S&T journalism leads to a disconnect with local issues [36, pp. 5\u20137].\nThemes that are particularly relevant in the Global South are left out. Racism, which has deep roots in the country's technological history [14], is only cited 52 times. Most refer to the electoral regulation citing racist content as an example of what should be removed by platforms [56]. Surveillance, another major concern in AI [57, p. 77], is overlooked. As of April 2024, 209 projects that apply facial recognition to policing and public security have been mapped in Brazil [58]."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This was the first study investigating how AI is covered in Brazilian news and highlights a media landscape that is largely reactive, commercially influenced, and episodic. By analyzing Brazilian media, this addresses the gap in research on AI coverage outside the anglophone world [10, p. 5]. This helps understand the concerns of hundreds of millions of people in a less privileged part of the globe that might not benefit from technological advancements as much as the wealthy bits [70], [71].\nThe main topics in the news about AI in Brazil show a predominance of coverage related to applying AI in work and discussing new products. Moreover, the most cited people and organizations show a high concentration of sources related to the industry, echoing a pattern seen abroad [12], [31]. This reinforces the agendas of powerful corporate stakeholders, thereby narrowing the public's understanding of AI's broader societal impacts. The significant focus on electoral integrity and deepfakes in Brazilian media reflects the country's recent history with disinformation and its impact on democracy [15], [16]. These findings underscore that while there are common themes in AI coverage globally, local contexts heavily influence the specifics of media narratives.\nThese findings highlight the need for more critical and diverse perspectives in AI journalism. This could involve training journalists to critically engage with AI technologies and their societal impacts, as a solid foundation is needed for this kind of expert coverage [67]. Also, since some of the problems arise from episodic coverage, investing in issue-based and analytical reporting, which does not rely on news events to bring up relevant discussions regularly, can be an alternative to foster more profound debate."}]}

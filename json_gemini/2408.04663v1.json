{"title": "Dopamin: Transformer-based Comment Classifiers through Domain Post-Training and Multi-level Layer Aggregation", "authors": ["Nam Le Hai", "Nghi D. Q. Bui"], "abstract": "Code comments provide important information for understanding the source code. They can help developers understand the overall purpose of a function or class, as well as identify bugs and technical debt. However, an overabundance of comments is meaningless and counterproductive. As a result, it is critical to automatically filter out these comments for specific purposes. In this paper, we present Dopamin, a Transformer-based tool for dealing with this issue. Our model excels not only in presenting knowledge sharing of common categories across multiple languages, but also in achieving robust performance in comment classification by improving comment representation. As a result, it outperforms the STACC baseline by 3% on the NLBSE'24 Tool Competition dataset in terms of average F1-score, while maintaining a comparable inference time for practical use. The source code is publicity available at https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/Dopamin.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the intricate world of software development, source code com-ments play a crucial role, serving as the backbone of applications by elucidating the functionality and intent behind code segments. These comments vary widely in their utility, ranging from summa-rizing the purpose of functions or classes, aiding in code mainte-nance, to identifying instances of technical debt, as highlighted in studies like [7, 9, 12]. However, not all code comments are equally beneficial, or different information in comments can be used for different development tasks. With the increasing complexity of software projects, the task of discerning valuable comments from the less pertinent ones has become more critical.Current tools for comment classification, as discussed in refer-ences like [1, 10, 11], predominantly focus on categorizing com-ments based on their apparent utility in the coding workflow. De-spite their effectiveness, these tools often lack the nuanced un-derstanding needed to differentiate between subtly different types of comments, limiting their practical utility. Recognizing this gap, this paper introduces Dopamin - a Transformer-based Comment Classifier that utilizes a code language model for an enhanced clas-sification process.Dopamin takes a novel approach, relying on domain post-training on diverse comment types across various coding environments, and adopting a multi-level layer aggregation strategy inspired by Karimi et al. [5]. The post-training procedure incorporates data from all programming languages, facilitating knowledge transfer across dif-ferent languages and leveraging the high-resource language (Java) to improve the less resource-intensive languages (Python). Mean-while, layer aggregation methodology enables Dopamin to not only classify comments but also understand the nuanced semantic in-formation they carry, as the higher layers in BERT are adept at capturing intricate semantic features, a concept supported by Jawa-har et al. [3]. By doing so, Dopamin significantly improves the relevance and accuracy of comment classification, catering to the evolving complexity of software development.The efficacy of Dopamin is evident in our experimental results, where it achieves an F1-score of 0.74, surpassing the 0.71 F1-score of the existing STACC [1] baseline. Through Dopamin, we aim to redefine the standards in code comment classification, providing a tool that is effective in distinguishing various types of comments on multiple programming languages."}, {"title": "2 DATA PREPARATION", "content": "In this section, we illustrate the NLBSE'24 Tool Competition dataset introduced by Kallis et al.

[1], we concatenate the class name and comment sentence to serve as the input to the model, employing \"</s>\" as the separator between them.\nData spliting: The training data is divided into a training set and a validation set for refining the optimal model. Instead of employ-ing the validation set for hyperparameter tuning, it is utilized to choose the best checkpoint during the training process. Due to the modest amount of data, we select only 10% of the training set of each category to serve as the validation set. We employ stratified sampling to maintain the label distribution in both sets."}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "This section describes the Dopamin methodology, including model selection, the methodology for obtaining the optimal checkpoint, domain post-training procedures, and layer aggregation techniques."}, {"title": "3.1 Model selection", "content": "We investigate several candidates as the backbone model. Since the primary source of classification information comes from comments, which are in natural language form, we choose RoBERTa [8] and ALBERT [6] as candidates. Additionally, the comments primarily contain syntax related to the coding domain. Therefore, we are also considering CodeBERT [2], which is a language model pretrained on large code corpus, as an option. We opt for these architectures because they are based on Transformer encoders, commonly em-ployed for classification tasks. Additionally, the base versions of these models share the same size as the baseline (STACC), resulting in fair comparison and no additional overhead in inference time, which is a key consideration for evaluation score. The performance of each model on the validation set is presented in Table 2. As a result, we select CodeBERT - the model that achieves the best F1 score on the validation set, as the backbone model."}, {"title": "3.2 Domain post-training", "content": "Table 1 shows that Python and Pharo have much fewer examples compared to Java. Besides, some categories are contained in both Java and Python languages such as Expand, Summary, and Usage. Therefore, we combined the data of all languages to finetune the CodeBERT backbone model in the data domain (post-training), facil-itating the transfer of knowledge across languages before individual training of models for each category in the target domain.During the post-training procedure, we did not concatenate the class name and comment sentence as input to the model as mentioned in Section 2.2. Instead, we concatenate the category to the comment sentence since the model is required to predict for all categories, necessitating the inclusion of category information in the input.Following the post-training of the model in the target domain, we utilize it as the initial state for the model to be trained individually for each category using the procedure in Section 3.4 and input feature in Section 2.2."}, {"title": "3.3 Multi-level layer aggregation", "content": "Jawahar et al. [3] previously showed that the upper layers in BERT yield rich semantic features of linguistic information and distinct layers can exhibit distinct capabilities in encoding semantic infor-mation. Hence, combining these layers can obtain a more compre-hensive representation for the input text. Therefore, we adopt the Hierarchical aggregation (HSUM) introduced by Karimi et al. [5] to enrich the comment representation. Specifically, we combined the top four layers of the model to obtain the final representation for comment."}, {"title": "3.4 Optimal checkpoint", "content": "Given the high cost of hyperparameter search for 19 categories, we choose to keep the hyperparameters constant throughout the training process for each category. Instead, we use the validation set to determine the best checkpoint step. This strategy is similar to early stopping, which aims to prevent the model from overfitting. We employ it as a heuristic to determine the optimal step for the stage of training the model on the original training set without validation. Specifically, there are two stages in the training process.\n\u2022 Stage 1: the model is trained on the training set and the best checkpoint (optimal_step) is obtained based on the F1-score of the validation set.\n\u2022 Stage 2: Considering the limited amount of data, training the model on the entire original training set is essential. After obtain-ing the optimal_step in stage 1, we train the model on the original training set and acquire the final model at step optimal_step + extra_steps. The extra_steps represents the additional steps due to the incorporation of more data during training.For example, after stage 1 the model for the Java - Deprecation category attains its highest F1 score at step 200. The extra_steps is set to 100, thus after training on the full original dataset in stage"}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENT SETUP", "content": "For reproducibility, we set the random seed as 0.

Consequently, the submission score reaches 0.703 compare to 0.675 of STACC baseline. Overall, the result indicates a consistent and significant enhancement in classi-fication effectiveness."}, {"title": "5.0.2 Performance by Language", "content": "Java: Dopamin performs better in categories like Pointer, Sum-mary, Ownership, Rational, and Usage, with notable improve-ments in F1-scores. For instance, Dopamin achieves F1-score at 0.90 compared to STACC's 0.78 in the Summary category.\n\u2022 Pharo: Dopamin shows improved performance in categories like Classreferences, Collaborators, and Example. For example, in the Classreferences category, Dopamin's F1-score is 0.68 compared to STACC's 0.52. However, Dopamin exhibits a weakness in 4 out of 7 categories when compared to STACC in this language. The explanation might stem from Pharo being the language with the lowest data volume per category (under 2000). Given the limited data, the few-shot approach (STACC) appears more effective than fine-tuning with classification loss (Dopamin). Moreover, the absence of overlap categories between Pharo and other languages could restrict the advantages of the Post-training stage.\n\u2022 Python: Dopamin also outperforms STACC in the Python cate-gory, particularly in Parameters, Summary, and Usage categories. These categories overlap with those in Java, suggesting the effec-tiveness of knowledge transfer during our Post-training process."}, {"title": "5.0.3 Category-Specific Performance", "content": "Dopamin excels particularly in categories where understanding the context and semantics is crucial, like Summary, Usage, and Ownership. In some categories, like Java - Expand and Pharo - Keyimplementationpoints, Dopamin's performance is lower than STACC. This suggests room for further optimization in certain specific categories.In summary, Dopamin generally exhibits a balanced improve-ment in both precision ($P_c$) and recall ($R_c$) across various categories. For example, in the Java - Usage category, Dopamin shows a preci-sion of 0.87 and recall of 0.95, compared to STACC's 0.64 and 0.92, respectively.

The results of this study on Validation and Test sets are illustrated in Table 3.\nOn the validation set, improvements are evident when adopting Post-training or Layer Aggregation independently, as opposed to fine-tuning the unmodified CodeBERT model. Especially, the post-training method makes up significant enhancement (over 5% on F1 score). Meanwhile, on the test set, HSUM demonstrates its efficacy in enhancing F1 score performance. This underscores the effective-ness of each proposed component. Consequently, the combination of these two methodologies, encapsulated in Dopamin, attains the highest performance of F1 score on both evaluation sets."}, {"title": "7 CONCLUSION", "content": "We proposed Dopamin, a novel approach for code comment classi-fication, which demonstrates notable advancements in the bench-mark.

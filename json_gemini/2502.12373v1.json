These operations are characterized by unpredictable, hazardous, and often dynamic environments that require rapid response and innovative tools to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the rescue process. Over the years, robotics has emerged as a critical component of SAR, augmenting human capabilities in scenarios that are dangerous, inaccessible, or otherwise beyond human capability. Traditional rigid robots, while effective in certain applications, frequently encounter significant limitations when faced with the complexities of SAR environments. Their rigid structures often struggle with navigating narrow passages, unstable rubble, or uneven terrains, which are common in disaster zones [2]."}, {"title": "DISASTER CHARACTERISTICS AND IMPACT ON ROBOTICS", "content": "Disasters, whether natural or manmade, are complex events that can cause wide- spread damage, disrupt communities, and challenge rescue efforts (Figure 1.). Under- standing their categories and phases is critical for designing and deploying effective robotic solutions. This section explores the two main types of disasters natural and manmade and the unique challenges they present to robotics in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations.\nNatural disasters originate from environmental or geological processes. These in- clude earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and landslides [17]. Each of these disasters has distinct characteristics that shape the environment in which rescue robots must operate [18]. For instance, earthquakes often result in collapsed buildings, creating rubble-filled terrains with narrow spaces and unstable surfaces [19]. Floods, on the other hand, submerge vast areas under water, rendering conventional rescue methods ineffective and requiring amphibious robotic systems to navigate [20]. Hurricanes combine strong winds, heavy rain, and debris, often necessitating aerial ro- bots for reconnaissance in areas inaccessible by land [21].\nIn natural disaster scenarios, robots face several significant challenges. The terrain is often unpredictable, with obstacles such as debris, mud, or water complicating move- ment. The environment may be hazardous, exposing robots to extreme temperatures, corrosive materials, or high pressure, depending on the type of disaster [22]. Addition- ally, limited visibility caused by smoke, water, or dust can hinder sensing and naviga- tion, making robust sensor systems essential for successful operation [23].\nManmade disasters result from human activities, either accidental or deliberate. Ex- amples include industrial fires, structural collapses, hazardous material spills, and ter- rorist attacks [24]. While these events may not always cover as large an area as natural disasters, they often pose a concentrated level of danger that is just as difficult to navi- gate. For example, structural collapses in urban environments can create unstable, de- bris-filled zones like those seen in earthquakes [19]. Fires introduce extreme heat and smoke, demanding materials and sensors that can withstand such conditions. Hazardous spills, such as chemical or radioactive leaks, add the challenge of avoiding contamina- tion, both for the robot and for the rescue team it supports [26].\nRobots operating in manmade disasters face additional challenges compared to nat- ural disasters. In many cases, the presence of toxic or flammable substances means the robots must be non-conductive or explosion-proof. Navigation in confined spaces, such as collapsed tunnels or building interiors, requires robots to be highly maneuverable and equipped with advanced tactile and environmental sensors [27]. Moreover, the dy- namic nature of these disasters, where conditions can change rapidly, necessitates quick adaptability and reliable communication systems to relay real-time data to human op- erators [28]."}, {"title": "TYPES OF SOFT ROBOTS USED IN SAR", "content": "Soft robots are categorized into six primary types based on their actuation mecha- nisms and materials (Table 1.). Each type offers unique capabilities tailored to specific applications in challenging environments, such as disaster zones and underwater res- cues. The table below highlights their key features, potential applications, and associ- ated challenges in real-world scenarios."}, {"title": "ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF SOFT ROBOTS IN CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS COMPARED TO RIGID ROBOTS.", "content": "One of the primary benefits of soft robots in SAR missions is their exceptional adapt- ability to challenging environments. Constructed from flexible materials like elasto- mers and hydrogels, soft robots can deform, bend, and stretch, enabling them to navi- gate through tight spaces and conform to irregular surfaces [33][34][35][36]. This flex- ibility allows them to traverse debris, rubble, and other obstacles commonly found in disaster zones, reaching areas that might be inaccessible to rigid robots or human res- cuers [39].\nSoft robots also offer safety benefits, particularly when operating near humans. Their compliant nature reduces the risk of injury during physical interactions, making them suitable for tasks that involve direct contact with survivors [37][38]. This characteristic is crucial in SAR operations, where the safety of both victims and rescue personnel is paramount.\nWhile soft robots bring unique advantages to Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, they are not without their drawbacks. In certain aspects, traditional rigid robots still outperform their soft counterparts, particularly in terms of strength, efficiency, and re- liability. A detailed comparison (See Table 2.) between the two highlights key chal- lenges that must be addressed for soft robots to reach their full potential in SAR appli- cations.\nSoft robots excel in environments where adaptability and safety are non-negotiable. Unlike rigid robots, their flexibility allows them to move through constrained spaces or over uneven debris where traditional designs would falter. Imagine a scenario where a survivor is trapped beneath a collapsed building. A soft robot, with its compliant struc- ture, could navigate the tight gaps, gently interact with fragile surroundings, and deliver life-saving resources without exacerbating the situation. This capacity for safe, non- destructive operations is what sets soft robots apart, especially in high stakes rescue missions.\nHowever, while their adaptability is their greatest strength, it also comes with sig- nificant trade-offs. Soft robots often struggle with heavy lifting or prolonged operations in abrasive environments. For example, the very materials that make them flexible like elastomers and hydrogels are prone to wear and tear when exposed to sharp debris or high temperatures. This is a critical limitation in scenarios where the robots might need to operate for extended periods or handle heavy loads, such as clearing rubble to access survivors."}, {"title": "SOFT ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES FOR DISASTERS", "content": "Soft robotic technologies leverage materials and mechanisms inspired by biological systems to offer unparalleled adaptability, safety, and efficiency in disaster response.

It highlights soft robotics' transformative potential in revolutionizing disaster response and the challenges needed to fully realize its capabilities."}, {"title": "Material selection", "content": "Material selection (Table 3.) is a critical aspect in the design and implementation of soft robotic technologies for disaster response [40]. The materials chosen must balance flexibility, durability, adaptability, and safety to ensure that the robots can navigate complex and hazardous environments effectively.\nWhen selecting materials for soft robotic technologies in disaster response, several key considerations must be addressed to ensure optimal performance and reliability [41].\nFlexibility and compliance are essential, allowing robots to conform to uneven sur- faces and navigate through rubble, tight spaces, and irregular terrains with high elastic- ity [19]. Durability and resilience are crucial for withstanding harsh environmental conditions such as extreme temperatures, moisture, dust, and mechanical stresses with- out significant degradation. Utilizing lightweight materials enhances the robots' mo- bility and ease of deployment, which is vital for time-sensitive rescue operations [19][43]. Actuation compatibility ensures that the chosen materials work seamlessly with various actuators, including pneumatic, hydraulic, or shape-memory alloys, facil- itating smooth and effective movements [43][44]. Safety is paramount, as materials must be non-toxic, non-abrasive, and safe for close interaction with human survivors. Additionally, sensor integration requires materials that can accommodate or interface with electronic components for navigation and hazard detection without compromising the robot's flexibility. Balancing these factors is essential for developing robust and efficient soft robots capable of operating effectively in disaster-stricken environments [43].\nMaterial selection plays a pivotal role in the advancement of soft robotics, particu- larly in designing systems capable of adapting to complex and dynamic environments. Notable contributions in this domain emphasize the importance of flexibility, durabil- ity, and responsiveness in materials to achieve desired functionalities. Muralidharan et al. (2023) [100] introduced a bio-inspired soft jellyfish robot featuring a polyimide- based structure actuated by shape memory alloys (SMA). This innovative material"}, {"title": "Locomotion Mechanisms.", "content": "Soft robotics employs diverse locomotion mechanisms -crawling, rolling, and shape morphing each offering unique advantages (Figure 2.). Crawling excels in navi- gating confined spaces with flexible, deformable bodies. Rolling prioritizes speed and energy efficiency across diverse terrains. Shape morphing combines adaptability and multifunctionality, enabling dynamic responses to environmental challenges."}, {"title": "a) Crawling locomotion", "content": "Crawling locomotion in robotics pertains to a mode of movement that involves sequen- tial contractions and expansions of the robotic body, akin to the motion observed in soft-bodied organisms such as worms and caterpillars. This form of locomotion is par- ticularly advantageous for navigating constrained and complex environments, as it en- ables robots to adapt their shape and traverse obstacles with considerable flexibility. Nature serves as the primary inspiration for such mechanisms, where organisms utilize peristaltic waves and frictional variation to move efficiently across diverse terrains.\nIn 2013, Umedachi et al. pioneered the development of a highly deformable, 3D-printed soft robot inspired by soft-bodied animals [105]. This innovation facilitated crawling locomotion through variable friction legs integrated with a flexible body capable of substantial deformation, enabling it to traverse confined spaces. However, limitations such as slow locomotion speed and restricted adaptability to diverse terrains were noted in this design.\nSubsequently, Pagano et al. in 2017 introduced a novel crawling robot that employed multi-stable origami structures [101]. By leveraging the unique characteristics of ori- gami patterns, the robot achieved rapid shape transformations, thereby improving its locomotion efficiency. The multi-stable configurations facilitated quick transitions be- tween shapes, enhancing its movement speed. Despite these advancements, challenges in precise control and maintaining stability across varied surfaces persisted.\nEach subsequent iteration has been based on the accomplishments and shortcomings of its predecessors. Consequently, Crawling motion robots have become one of the most sought-after techniques in the field of soft robotics."}, {"title": "b) Rolling locomotion", "content": "Rolling locomotion in soft robotics involves continuous rotation, enabling robots to traverse environments by propelling their entire bodies. This contrasts with crawling locomotion, achieved through sequential body contractions and expansions, as ob- served in soft-bodied organisms such as worms and caterpillars. Rolling offers ad- vantages in terms of speed and energy efficiency over crawling, as it reduces frictional contact with surfaces and facilitates smoother transitions across diverse terrains.\nIn 2018, Li and colleagues introduced a fast-rolling soft robot driven by dielectric elas- tomer actuators [109]. The robot possessed a fully flexible circular configuration, ena- bling rapid rolling locomotion through applied voltages. However, the reliance on high- voltage actuation posed safety concerns and energy limitations.\nTo address these challenges, Chen et al. developed RUBIC, an untethered soft robot capable of discrete path following through rolling locomotion [108]. The design incor- porated a unique actuation mechanism that allowed for controlled rolling without the need for high-voltage inputs, enhancing safety and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the robot's adaptability to confined environments remained restricted.\nIn 2022, Fu and colleagues presented a humidity-powered soft robot with fast rolling locomotion. This design utilized environmental humidity as a power source, enabling energy-efficient rolling movement [107]. While innovative, the robot's performance was contingent on ambient humidity levels, potentially limiting its applicability in di- verse environmental conditions.\nTo enhance adaptability in confined spaces, Wharton et al. introduced Tetraflex (Figure 3.) in 2023, a multigait soft robot capable of object transportation. Tetraflex employed a rolling gait that discretized locomotion into predictable steps on a triangular grid,"}, {"title": "C) Shape Morphing locomotion", "content": "Shape morphing in soft robotics refers to a robot's ability to dynamically alter its form to adapt to various tasks and environments. Unlike specific locomotion modes such as rolling-where a robot moves by rotating its body\u2014and crawling\u2014which involves se- quential body contractions and expansions-shape morphing encompasses a broader range of deformations, enabling multifunctionality and enhanced adaptability.\nIn 2014, Germann and colleagues introduced soft cells capable of programmable self- assembly [117], allowing robotic modules to adapt their shapes for various tasks. This foundational work demonstrated the potential of modular soft robots in achieving com- plex configurations through shape morphing.\nBy 2022, Pratt and colleagues developed \u201ctensegristats,\u201d lightweight untethered morph- ing robots inspired by tensegrity structures [115]. These robots showcased large-scale shape changes between forms, enhancing their adaptability and functionality in various applications.\nIn 2023, Kabutz and Jayaram designed CLARI, a miniature modular origami passive shape-morphing robot. CLARI utilized origami techniques to achieve body defor- mation, enabling locomotion in confined spaces and demonstrating the potential of ori- gami-inspired designs in soft robotics [114]. Later in 2023, Kabutz, Hedrick, McDon- nell, and Jayaram introduced mCLARI, an insect-scale quadrupedal robot capable of omnidirectional terrain-adaptive locomotion. mCLARI employed passive shape morphing to navigate through narrow spaces, further advancing the capabilities of min- iature soft robots.[116]\nIn 2024, Chen and colleagues developed scale-inspired programmable robotic struc- tures with concurrent shape morphing and stiffness variation. These designs drew in- spiration from biological scales, enabling robots to adapt their shape and rigidity in response to environmental demands, enhancing their versatility [113]. Also in 2024, Diao et al. proposed a robotic morphing interface with reprogrammable stiffness based on machine learning. This system allowed for precise shape control, enabling multi-objective shape imitation and transformation, showcasing the integration of artificial intelligence in shape-morphing soft robotics [112].\nThese developments highlight the rapid progression of shape-morphing capabilities in soft robotics, with each advancement addressing previous limitations and contributing to more adaptable and multifunctional robotic systems.\nSoft robotics leveraging crawling, rolling, and shape-morphing locomotion mecha- nisms hold immense potential for Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, offering novel ways to address the challenges of navigating hazardous environments. Crawling robots, such as the 2013 design by Umedachi et al. [105], can maneuver through debris-filled spaces and collapsed structures, utilizing their deformable bodies and peristaltic motion to access locations unreachable by traditional rigid robots. Their ability to grip and move across uneven terrains makes them ideal for locating survivors under rubble.\nRolling robots, like the humidity-powered design by Fu et al. in 2022 [107], can quickly traverse large, open areas with minimal energy consumption. In time-critical scenarios, their speed and efficiency allow for rapid scouting of disaster zones. Additionally, roll- ing robots equipped with adaptive gaits, such as the 2023 Tetraflex [110], can switch to confined-space locomotion, increasing their versatility in SAR missions.\nShape-morphing robots, including the 2023 mCLARI by Kabutz et al. [116], offer unique capabilities for adapting to unpredictable and dynamically changing environ- ments. These robots can compress and expand to navigate narrow crevices or adjust their stiffness to maintain stability in precarious conditions. The integration of machine learning, as seen in Diao et al.'s 2024 morphing interface [112], further enhances their precision in shape adaptation, enabling real-time responses to complex scenarios.\nTogether, these mechanisms crawling, rolling, and shape-morphing form a robust toolkit for addressing the multifaceted challenges of SAR missions. Crawling robots can penetrate deep into collapsed structures to locate survivors, rolling robots can quickly scout large open areas or provide rapid transport of critical supplies, and shape- morphing robots can adapt to the most unpredictable and restrictive environments. When integrated into a coordinated SAR system, these soft robots could revolutionize rescue efforts by providing both breadth and depth in their operational scope. For ex- ample, a SAR mission might deploy rolling robots for initial reconnaissance and hazard mapping, followed by crawling and shape-morphing robots to reach survivors in intri- cate spaces and deliver life-saving resources. By leveraging the unique strengths of each locomotion type, SAR teams can significantly enhance their effectiveness, ensur- ing that no environment is too complex or inaccessible for rescue."}, {"title": "Sensing Capabilities.", "content": "Integrating sensors into soft robots poses a set of complex challenges due to their intrinsic flexibility and compliance.

Traditional sensors often limit the robot's motion range, fail under con- tinuous deformation, or compromise the robot's adaptability. Furthermore, environmen- tal factors such as dust, water, and extreme temperatures common in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations can impair sensor functionality.

This reduces the risk of detachment or damage.\n3. Wireless Communication: Using wireless transmission minimizes reliance on rigid wiring, enhancing the robot's adaptability and reliability.\n4. Environmental Hardening: Sensors are encapsulated with protective coat- ings to withstand extreme SAR conditions, such as exposure to water or high temperatures.\nRoBoa, developed by a team at ETH Zurich [118], is a vine-like soft robot equipped with a sensor-packed head. This head integrates an array of sensors, including those for detecting temperature, gas, and motion. The temperature sensors allow the robot to de- tect heat signatures, potentially identifying trapped survivors. Gas sensors monitor haz- ardous chemical emissions, such as methane or carbon monoxide, often present in col- lapsed structures. Motion sensors enhance the robot's spatial awareness, enabling it to navigate shifting debris effectively. The compact, adaptive design of the RoBoa system highlights advancements in embedding multi-functional sensors into soft, deformable materials without compromising flexibility.\nResearchers introduced soft growing robots capable of deploying distributed sensor networks in confined spaces [119]. These robots use soft actuators to \"grow\" into inac- cessible areas, extending their reach like plant roots. Sensors embedded within the ac- tuators monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and gas lev- els. A notable advancement is the incorporation of distributed sensing arrays, allowing the robot to gather data across its entire length rather than relying on a single sensor hub. This network-based sensing strategy provides a comprehensive environmental as- sessment, crucial for detecting survivors or assessing structural integrity in collapsed areas.\nTouchless sensing systems, developed in 2024 [120], enable soft robots to perceive their surroundings without direct contact. Using electromagnetic or optical sensing technologies such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) or capacitive proximity sensors, these robots can map their environments and detect obstacles or hazards from a distance. LiDAR allows high-resolution 3D mapping, aiding in navigation through rubble, while capacitive sensors detect nearby objects without physical interaction, minimizing the risk of sensor damage in unstable conditions.\nProprioceptive sensing (Depicted in Figure 4.), demonstrated in 2023 [121], equips soft robots with the ability to monitor their position, movement, and deformation. By em- bedding stretchable strain sensors or using fiber-optic sensors, these robots gain real- time feedback on their own structural configuration. This advancement allows robots to adapt their movements to navigate narrow or irregular spaces effectively. For in- stance, strain sensors can provide precise data on bending angles, ensuring the robot avoids structural stress or collapse while moving through debris.\nIn 2024, researchers introduced a retrofit sensing strategy designed for soft fluidic ro- bots [122]. This approach enables the addition of tactile and environmental sensors to existing robots without significant redesigns. The strategy utilizes flexible sensor patches made of piezoelectric or conductive polymer materials, which can be adhered to the robot's surface. These sensors enhance tactile capabilities, allowing robots to de- tect pressure, texture, or object proximity. Additionally, retrofitting with environmental sensors, such as chemical detectors, enhances the robot's ability to probe hazardous debris or interact with fragile objects in SAR scenarios."}, {"title": "EVALUATION AND BENCHMARKS", "content": null}, {"title": "Simulation Techniques.", "content": "In the domain of Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, the intrinsic flexibility and adaptability of soft robots render them highly suitable for applications such as travers- ing debris-filled spaces, navigating uneven terrains, and manipulating fragile objects without inflicting damage.

It enables the compu- tation of derivatives with respect to inputs, facilitating gradient-based optimization. In a study [128] utilizing the ChainQueen simulator (Figure 5.) a differentiable simu- lation framework based on the Material Point Method (MPM) researchers achieved significant advancements in soft robot design and control. The simulator demonstrated the capability to model complex deformations and interactions of soft materials with high accuracy. For instance, in the simulation of a soft robotic arm, ChainQueen accu- rately predicted the arm's deformation under various loading conditions, facilitating the optimization of control strategies to achieve desired end-effector positions with mini- mal error. Quantitatively, the simulator achieved a prediction accuracy within 5% of the actual deformation, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the nuanced behav- iors of soft robotic systems. of differentiable simulation in soft robotics.\nFurthermore, differentiable simulation was employed to optimize the design of a soft robotic gripper [124]. By computing the gradients of the gripper's performance metrics with respect to its design parameters, the simulation guided the iterative design process to enhance gripping efficiency. The optimized gripper exhibited a 20% increase in pay- load capacity and a 15% improvement in energy efficiency compared to its initial de- sign, demonstrating the practical benefits of differentiable simulation in soft robotics.\nSimilarly, Mass-Spring models are widely used. For instance, researchers employed a Mass-Spring model to simulate a soft robot's movement through granular media. The simulation accurately predicted the robot's locomotion patterns, which were then vali- dated against experimental data, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing the interaction between the soft robot and its environment [129]. In another case [130], a Mass-Spring model was utilized to simulate the dynamic behavior of a piezoelectric soft robot. The simulation results closely matched the experimental observations, with the robot achieving a forward motion of approximately 1 cm/s, highlighting the model's capability in predicting complex motions of soft robotic systems.\nOther proven techniques, such as Reduced-Order Models (ROMs), are instrumental in simplifying the complex dynamics of soft robots, enabling efficient real-time control and optimization. In one study [131], researchers applied model order reduction tech- niques to a high-fidelity finite element model of a soft robot. This approach reduced computational complexity by approximately 90%, facilitating real-time trajectory opti- mization and tracking. The reduced model maintained an accuracy within 5% of the full-order model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing essential dynamics while significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Another study [132] proposed a re- duced-order modeling strategy for a soft robot composed of hyperelastic materials ac- tuated by cables. The reduced model achieved a substantial reduction in computational time, making it suitable for real-time control applications.

Real-world testing ensures that the robot's de- sign, materials, and control systems function as intended under practical constraints like irregular debris, varying surface textures, and environmental stresses.\nHardware tests also provide essential data for iterative improvements, enabling en- gineers to identify and address weaknesses in the robot's structure or control mecha- nisms. Additionally, these tests establish the robot's reliability and readiness for deploy- ment in critical, life-saving operations.\nSome studies in the literature have conducted extensive hardware testing. One such work [134] involves a hybrid gripper that combines the precise control and strength of a hard gripper with the flexibility and adaptability of a soft jamming module. Hardware tests were conducted in environments simulating collapsed terrains to assess its effec- tiveness in disaster scenarios. The gripper was tasked with manipulating unstructured objects of varying shapes and sizes, such as rubble and debris. It demonstrated the abil- ity to grasp objects securely, including irregular and fragile items, using its jamming module to conform to different shapes. Additional tests included tasks such as opening and closing doors and clearing confined pathways blocked by debris.\nThe results showed a 48.61% improvement in payload capacity compared to using a traditional hard gripper alone. This demonstrated the hybrid gripper's capability to per- form critical functions like obstacle removal and manipulation of heavy objects in chal- lenging environments. These tests validated its potential for deployment in mobile ro- bots for rescue and reconnaissance operations in disaster settings.\nAnother study [135] focuses on robots designed to assist in demining operations (Figure 6.), utilizing an innovative air-releasable deployment system via drones. The hardware tests focused on their ability to withstand impact, navigate unpredictable ter- rains, and neutralize explosives. The robots were dropped from drones at heights of 4.5 meters onto simulated minefields, replicating real-world demining scenarios.\nUpon landing, the soft robots employed vacuum-based roller actuators to move across uneven surfaces and approach dummy landmines. Their soft, flexible structure mini- mized the risk of triggering explosives during navigation. The robots successfully iden- tified and neutralized multiple dummy landmines, proving their durability and effec- tiveness in field conditions. These tests underscored the robots' capability to perform critical demining tasks in dangerous, real-world environments.\nAdditionally, in another study [133], inspired by the growth mechanisms of plants, a vine robot employs an innovative design allowing it to extend and navigate through complex, confined spaces (Figure 7.). The vine robot was rigorously tested in a con- trolled artificial rubble testbed constructed to replicate urban disaster scenarios. The testbed featured a variety of simulated obstacles, including small and large debris, as well as narrow crevices mimicking collapsed structures.\nThe robot was evaluated based on several performance metrics, including its ability to penetrate dense rubble, maintain stability, and navigate through cluttered pathways. By utilizing pneumatic muscles for precise steering and oscillation, the vine robot demon- strated consistent penetration depths and the ability to traverse mixed obstacle environ- ments.

Despite over a decade since the boom in soft robotics, most advancements remain confined to aca- demic studies and experimental setups. For instance, in the domain of search-and-res- cue (SAR) operations, only a handful of soft robots, like those developed through ini- tiatives such as RoboA, have transitioned to real-world deployment. The majority of soft robots remain in the research phase, with limited tangible impact on critical mis- sions like disaster response.\nThis reality underscores the need for a concerted effort to bridge the lab-to-field di- vide. Addressing challenges such as reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness is es- sential for making soft robots a viable tool in high-stakes environments. Furthermore, ethical and practical considerations must guide their deployment to ensure that these technologies are not only effective but also safe and responsibly utilized.\nSoft robotics is still in its early stages, and while the progress may seem slow, the field holds great potential for transformative applications. With continued interdiscipli- nary collaboration and sustained effort, these innovations could one day become indis- pensable tools in SAR operations and beyond."}]}

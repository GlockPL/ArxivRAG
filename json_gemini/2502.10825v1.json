However, RADAR covers only 13 techniques across six tactics. Similarly, ACTDETECTOR [112] processes NIDS alerts to detect attack phases aligned with 14 ATT&CK tactics. Using Doc2Vec embeddings and temporal sequence classifiers, it identifies multi-stage attack activities. Graph-based approaches, such as [39], leverage Neo4j for representing network traffic patterns, focusing on the reconnaissance tactic.\nSystem logs are extensively used to map ATT&CK techniques for threat detection [124, 185, 207, 239]. [207] employs process mining to detect adversarial patterns by profiling system event logs into TTPs and mining process models. Similarly, [239] integrates IoC-based ATT&CK mapping with ML models to detect multi-stage attacks in real time. In lateral movement detection, [185] extracts ATT&CK techniques from Windows logs and identifies movement paths through quan-titative analysis. A recommendation system proposed in [124] predicts attacker behaviors using KNN-based collaborative filtering, correlating logs with ATT&CK TTPs.\nAttack graphs provide a comprehensive view of multi-step attack scenarios by integrating ATT&CK tactics. One paper [212] has combined MITRE ATT&CK framework and attack graph for attack path identification in multi-step cyber threat scenarios. Similar to [112], ATT&CK tactics are uti-lized as kill chain stages.

[9] constructs attack emulation plans using CTI-derived TTPs to simulate attack flows, enabling proactive threat hunt-ing and hypothesis validation. Similarly, [243] applies ATT&CK ICS techniques to simulate multi-step attack scenarios on water management systems. Detection methods, including SVM-based classifiers and Wazuh host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS), are evaluated to visualize attack propagation on an ELK dashboard.\nAttack simulations also support the generation of datasets for incident response and methodol-ogy evaluation [62, 238].

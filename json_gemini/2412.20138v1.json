{"title": "TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework", "authors": ["Yijia Xiao", "Edward Sun", "Di Luo", "Wei Wang"], "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Autonomous agents leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) present a transformative approach to decision-making by replicating human processes and workflows across various applications. These systems enhance the problem-solving capabilities of language agents by equipping them with tools and enabling collaboration with other agents, effectively breaking down complex problems into manageable components (Park et al. 2023; Havrilla et al. 2024; Talebirad and Nadiri 2023; Tang et al. 2024). One prominent application of these autonomous frameworks is in the financial market a highly complex system influenced by numerous factors, including company fundamentals, market sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic events.\nTraditional algorithmic trading systems often rely on quantitative models that struggle to fully capture the complex interplay of diverse factors. In contrast, LLMs excel at processing and understanding natural language data, making them particularly effective for tasks that require textual comprehension, such as analyzing news articles, financial reports, and social media sentiment. Additionally, deep learning-based trading systems often suffer from low explainability, as they rely on hidden features that drive decision-making but are difficult to interpret. Recent advancements in multi-agent LLM frameworks for finance have shown significant promise in addressing these challenges. These frameworks create explainable Al systems, where decisions are supported by evidence and transparent reasoning (Li et al. 2023a; Wang et al. 2024b; Yu et al. 2024), demonstrating their potential in financial applications.\nDespite their potential, most current applications of language agents in the financial and trading sectors face two significant limitations:\nLack of Realistic Organizational Modeling: Many frameworks fail to capture the complex interactions between agents that mimic the structure of real-world trading firms (Li et al. 2023a; Wang et al. 2024b; Yu et al. 2024). Instead, they focus narrowly on specific task performance, often disconnected from the organizational workflows and established human operating procedures proven effective in trading. This limits their ability to fully replicate and benefit from real-world trading practices.\nInefficient Communication Interfaces: Most existing systems use natural language as the primary communication medium, typically relying on message histories or an unstructured pool of information for decision-making (Park et al. 2023; Qian et al. 2024). This approach often results in a \"telephone effect\", where details are lost, and states become corrupted as conversations lengthen. Agents struggle to maintain context and track extended histories while filtering out irrelevant information from previous decision steps, diminishing their effectiveness in handling complex, dynamic tasks. Additionally, the unstructured pool-of-information approach lacks clear instructions, forcing logical communication and information exchange between agents to depend solely on retrieval, which disrupts the relational integrity of the data.\nIn this work, we address these key limitations of existing models by introducing a system that overcomes these challenges. First, our framework bridges the gap by simulating"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "LLMs as Financial Assistants\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are applied in finance by fine-tuning on financial data or training on financial corpora. This improves the model's understanding of financial terminology and data, enabling a specialized assistant for analytical support, insights, and information retrieval, rather than trade execution.\nFine-Tuned LLMs for Finance\nFine-tuning enhances domain-specific performance. Examples include PIXIU (FinMA) (Xie et al. 2023), which fine-tuned LLaMA on 136K finance-related instructions; FinGPT (Yang, Liu, and Wang 2023), which used LoRA to fine-tune models like LLaMA and ChatGLM with about 50K finance-specific samples; and Instruct-FinGPT (Zhang, Yang, and Liu 2023), fine-tuned on 10K instruction samples from financial sentiment analysis datasets. These models outperform their base versions and other open-source LLMs like BLOOM and OPT (Zhang et al. 2022) in finance classification tasks, even surpassing BloombergGPT (Wu et al. 2023) in several evaluations. However, in generative tasks, they perform similarly or slightly worse than powerful general-purpose models like GPT-4, indicating a need for more high-quality, domain-specific datasets.\nFinance LLMs Trained from Scratch\nTraining LLMs from scratch on finance-specific corpora aims for better domain adaptation. Models like BloombergGPT (Wu et al. 2023), XuanYuan 2.0 (Zhang, Yang, and Xu 2023), and Fin-T5 (Lu et al. 2023) combine public datasets with finance-specific data during pretraining. BloombergGPT, for instance, was trained on both general and financial text, with proprietary Bloomberg data enhancing its performance on finance benchmarks. These models outperform general-purpose counterparts like BLOOM-176B and T5 in tasks such as market sentiment classification and summarization. While they may not match larger closed-source models like GPT-3 or PaLM (Chowdhery et al. 2022), they offer competitive performance among similar-sized open-source models without compromising general language understanding.\nIn summary, finance-specific LLMs developed through fine-tuning or training from scratch show significant improvements in domain-specific tasks, underscoring the importance of domain adaptation and the potential for further enhancements with high-quality finance-specific datasets."}, {"title": "LLMs as Traders", "content": "LLMs act as trader agents making direct trading decisions by analyzing external data like news, financial reports, and stock prices. Proposed architectures include news-driven, reasoning-driven, and reinforcement learning (RL)-driven agents.\nNews-Driven Agents\nNews-driven architectures integrate stock news and macroeconomic updates into LLM prompts to predict stock price movements. Studies evaluating both closed-source models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source LLMs (e.g., Qwen (Bai et al. 2023), Baichuan (Yang et al. 2023)) in financial sentiment analysis have shown the effectiveness of simple long-short strategies based on sentiment scores (Lopez-Lira and Tang 2023). Further research on fine-tuned LLMs like FinGPT and OPT demonstrates improved performance through domain-specific alignment (Zhang et al. 2024a; Kirtac and Germano 2024). Advanced methods involve summarizing news data and reasoning about their relationship with stock prices (Fatouros et al. 2024a; Wang, Izumi, and Sakaji 2024).\nReasoning-Driven Agents\nReasoning-driven agents enhance trading decisions through mechanisms like reflection and debate. Reflection-driven agents, such as FinMem (Yu et al. 2023) and FinAgent (Zhang et al. 2024b), use layered memorization and multimodal data to summarize inputs into memories, inform decisions, and incorporate technical indicators, achieving superior backtest performance while mitigating hallucinations (Ji et al. 2023). Debate-driven agents, like those in heterogeneous frameworks (Xing 2024) and TradingGPT (Li et al. 2023b), enhance reasoning and factual validity by employing LLM debates among agents with different roles, improving sentiment classification and increasing robustness in trading decisions.\nReinforcement Learning-Driven Agents\nReinforcement learning methods align LLM outputs with expected behaviors, using backtesting as rewards. SEP (Koa et al. 2024) employs RL with memorization and reflection to refine LLM predictions based on market history. Classical RL methods are also used in trading frameworks that integrate LLM-generated embeddings with stock features, trained via algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Ding et al. 2023; Schulman et al. 2017)."}, {"title": "LLMs as Alpha Miners", "content": "LLMs are also used to generate alpha factors instead of making direct trading decisions. QuantAgent (Wang et al. 2023) demonstrates this by leveraging LLMs to produce alpha factors through an inner-loop and outer-loop architecture. In the inner loop, a writer agent generates a script from a trader's"}, {"title": "TradingAgents: Role Specialization", "content": "Assigning LLM agents clear, well-defined roles with specific goals enables the breakdown of complex objectives into smaller, manageable subtasks. Financial trading is a prime example of such complexity, demanding the integration of diverse signals, inputs, and specialized expertise. In the real world, this approach to managing complexity is demonstrated by trading firms that rely on expert teams to collaborate and make high-stakes decisions, underscoring the multifaceted nature of the task.\nIn a typical trading firm, vast amounts of data are collected, including financial metrics, price movements, trading volumes, historical performance, economic indicators, and news sentiment. This data is then analyzed by quantitative experts (quants), including mathematicians, data scientists, and engineers, using advanced tools and algorithms to identify trends and predict market movements.\nInspired by this organizational structure, TradingAgents defines seven distinct agent roles within a simulated trading firm: Fundamentals Analyst, Sentiment Analyst, News Analyst, Technical Analyst, Researcher, Trader, and Risk Manager. Each agent is assigned a specific name, role, goal, and set of constraints, alongside predefined context, skills, and tools tailored to their function. For example, a Sentiment Analyst is equipped with tools like web search engines, Reddit search APIs, X/Twitter search tools, and sentiment score calculation algorithms, while a Technical Analyst can execute code, calculate technical indicators, and analyze trading patterns. More specifically, TradingAgents assumes the following teams."}, {"title": "Analyst Team", "content": "The Analyst Team is composed of specialized agents responsible for gathering and analyzing various types of market data to inform trading decisions. Each agent focuses on a specific aspect of market analysis, bringing together a comprehensive view of the market's conditions.\n\u2022 Fundamental Analyst Agents: These agents evaluate company fundamentals by analyzing financial statements, earnings reports, insider transactions, and other pertinent data. They assess a company's intrinsic value to identify undervalued or overvalued stocks, providing insights into long-term investment potential.\n\u2022 Sentiment Analyst Agents: These agents process large volumes of social media posts, sentiment scores, and insider sentiments derived from public information and social media activity. They gauge market sentiment to predict how collective investor behavior might impact stock prices in the short term.\n\u2022 News Analyst Agents: These agents analyze news articles, government announcements, and other macroeconomic indicators to assess the market's macroeconomic state, major world events, and significant company changes. They identify news events that could influence market movements, helping to anticipate sudden shifts in market dynamics.\n\u2022 Technical Analyst Agents: These agents calculate and select relevant technical indicators, such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), customized for specific assets. They analyze price patterns and trading volumes to forecast future price movements, assisting in timing entry and exit points.\nCollectively, the Analyst Team synthesizes data from multiple sources to provide a holistic market analysis.

They play a crucial role in safeguarding assets and ensuring sustainable long-term performance.\nAll agents in TradingAgents follow the ReAct prompting framework (Yao et al. 2023), which synergizes reasoning and acting. The environment state is shared and monitored by the agents, enabling them to take context-appropriate actions such as conducting research, executing trades, engaging in debates, or managing risks. This design ensures a collaborative, dynamic decision-making process reflective of real-world trading systems."}, {"title": "Trading Agents: Agent Workflow", "content": "Communication Protocol\nMost existing LLM-based agent frameworks use natural language as the primary communication interface, typically through structured message histories or collections of agent-generated messages (Fatouros et al. 2024b; Li et al. 2023a; Yang et al. 2024; Yang, Yue, and He 2023). However, relying solely on natural language often proves insufficient for solving complex, long-term tasks that require extensive planning horizons. In such cases, pure natural language communication can resemble a game of telephone-over multiple iterations, initial information may be forgotten or distorted due to context length limitations and an overload of text that obscures critical earlier details (Hong et al. 2024). To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from frameworks like MetaGPT, which adopt a structured approach to communication. Our model introduces a structured communication protocol to govern agent interactions. Our model introduces a structured communication protocol to govern agent interactions. By clearly defining each agent's state, we ensure that each role only extracts or queries the necessary information, processes it, and returns a completed report. This streamlined approach reduces unnecessary steps, lowers the risk of message corruption, and keeps interactions focused and efficient, even in complex, long-horizon tasks."}, {"title": "Types of Agent Interactions", "content": "In contrast to previous multi-agent trading frameworks, which rely heavily on natural language dialogue, TradingAgents agents communicate primarily through structured documents and diagrams. These documents encapsulate the agents' insights in concise, well-organized reports that preserve essential content while avoiding irrelevant information. By utilizing structured reports, agents can query necessary details directly from the global state, eliminating the need for lengthy conversations that risk diluting information, extending the message state indefinitely, and causing data loss.

These reports include key metrics, insights, and recommendations based on their specialized analyses.\n\u2022 Traders: Traders review and analyze the reports from the analysts, carefully deliberating to produce clear decision signals. They accompany these decisions with detailed reports explaining their rationale and supporting evidence, which are later utilized by the risk management team.\nAgents engage in natural language dialogue exclusively during agent-to-agent conversations and debates. These concise, focused discussions have been shown to promote deeper reasoning and integrate diverse perspectives, enabling more balanced decisions in complex, long-horizon scenarios a method particularly relevant to the intricate environment of trading (Du et al. 2023).

Quick-thinking models, such as gpt-4o-mini and gpt-4o, efficiently handle fast, low-depth tasks like summarization, data retrieval, and converting tabular data to text (OpenAI et al. 2024). In contrast, deep-thinking models like o1-preview excel in reasoning-intensive tasks such as decision-making, evidence-based report writing, and data analysis. These models leverage their architectures for multi-round reasoning, producing logically sound, in-depth insights (Zhong et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024a; OpenAI 2024). Additionally, we prioritize models with proven reliability and scalability to ensure optimal performance across various market conditions. We also employ auxiliary expert models for specialized tasks like sentiment analysis.\nSpecifically, all analyst nodes rely on deep-thinking models to ensure robust analysis, while quick-thinking models handle data retrieval from APIs and tools for efficiency. Researchers and traders use deep-thinking models to generate valuable insights and support well-informed decisions. By aligning the choice of LLMs with the specific requirements of each task, our framework achieves a balance between efficiency and depth of reasoning, which is crucial for effective trading strategies.\nThis implementation strategy ensures that TradingAgents can be deployed without requiring a GPU, relying only on API credits. It also introduces seamless exchangeability of backbone models, enabling researchers to effortlessly replace the model with any locally hosted or API-accessible alternatives in the future.

The events held in tourist destinations may help to meet those needs and thus contribute to tourist satisfaction. As with product management, the creation of hierarchical catalogs to classify those events can aid event management. The events that can be found on the internet are listed in dispersed, heterogeneous sources, which makes direct classification a difficult, time-consuming task. The main aim of this work is to create a novel process for automatically classifying an eclectic variety of tourist events using a hierarchical taxonomy, which can be applied to support tourist destination management. Leveraging data science methods such as CRISP-DM, supervised machine learning, and natural language processing techniques, the automatic classification process proposed here allows the creation of a normalized catalog across very different geographical regions. Therefore, we can build catalogs with consistent filters, allowing users to find events regardless of the event categories assigned at source, if any. This is very valuable for companies that offer this kind of information across multiple regions, such as airlines, travel agencies or hotel chains. Ultimately, this tool has the potential to revolutionize the way companies and end users interact with tourist events information.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Knowing what events are available in a destination can be an important factor in a tourist's decision-making process. Events can enhance the attractiveness of a destination and provide unique experiences for tourists [1]. They can boost tourist traffic, encourage tourism spending, and build the identity of the tourist destination [2]. Tourists may be attracted to destinations that host events related to their interests, such as music festivals, sports competitions, cultural festivals, or conferences. Classifying an event can help in the travel decision process by making it easier for tourists to find and choose events that align with their interests and preferences.\nFrom the perspective of tourism destination management, it is crucial to know clients' needs in order to be able to adapt services accordingly. Tourist events linked to a destination are an important part of these services. Such events are an important driver of tourism, and figure prominently in the development and marketing plans of most destinations. In order to develop the potential of tourist destinations, event managers should be involved in the planning process [3]. However, tourism is a fragmented and disjointed activity [4,5,6] and we do not see the mass adoption of event segmentation. Most tourist events are publicized on the internet via aggregators, affiliated players, or organizer sites. While they are usually categorized, there is not a widely-used standard for event taxonomies. Indeed, there are only a few fields that are used extensively: title/name, description, and place. Moreover, none of those fields are structured or normalized. Having a client-centered tourism product taxonomy is vital to be able to create a marketing-oriented product category system. Some taxonomy systems have been proposed in previous works, such as [7] or [8]. They suggest that the tourism sector should adopt a standard taxonomy for tourist events, but encouraging widespread adoption is a challenge.\nDespite the importance of event segmentation in tourism destination management, there is still a need for a standardized taxonomy to classify events. In seeking to address this gap, our goal is to pioneer a process that automatically classifies tourist events of diverse types, sourced from varied locations, using a hierarchical taxonomy. This innovative approach permits the creation of a normalized event catalog. Our solution accommodates the needs of travelers in the inspirational phase of their trip-planning, providing access to a consistent classification of events, regardless of source, language, or original category. By extension, our work also significantly benefits companies that offer tourism services in different regions.\nBy applying the process developed, we can create a live catalog of events with a normalized taxonomy, regardless of the category (if any) assigned by the event listing source. This is especially useful for travelers in the inspirational phase of their trip-planning, as they can use the same taxonomy regardless of the event source, language or original category. Since it is useful for the potential tourist, it is also useful for companies that offer tourism services in different regions or want to promote destinations, independently of event listing sources. Such companies may include airlines, OTAs, traditional travel agencies, hotel chains, etc.\nThe methodology used for this work is CRISP-DM, a European open standard process model that describes common approaches used by data mining experts [9]. In the context of CRISP-DM, other techniques are used, such as machine learning (ML)-specifically supervised learning\u2014and natural language processing (NPL). The main aim is to apply our model to real-world data; therefore, in addition to the model itself, we propose an underlying architecture that allows its practical application.\nTo create a classifier for tourism events we need to use a statistically significant number of heterogeneous events to train our model. In this study, we used 1103 event listing sources from 30+ countries to collect 700,000 events listed in 23 languages. The remainder of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the state of the art and compares the studies related to our proposal; Section 3 presents the foundations of NPL and supervised learning, on which our proposal is based; Section 4 describes the model for classification; Section 5 shows the results obtained by this model and a use case; finally, Section 6, draws conclusions and suggests future avenues of work."}, {"title": "2. Literature review", "content": "Classic studies show that market segmentation can be a good management and marketing strategy [10]. Segmentation involves viewing a heterogeneous market as several smaller, more homogeneous markets [11]. In tourism, it can aid decision-making; indeed, segmentation based on tourist events is a hot topic in the industry, but little work has been done on how to apply a taxonomy model to current or future events.\nThere are many criteria to use when classifying events, and different areas of classification, such as thematic or geographical. In this section, we include only those papers that are directly related to general events and ways to taxonomize and classify them."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The proposed method for automatically classifying events relies on two main systems: a language model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) and a logistic regression model for classification."}, {"title": "3.1 BERT", "content": "BERT is currently the preeminent, state-of-the-art natural language model [20]. It uses a bidirectional transformer to train a language model on a large corpus originally provided by Google, and can be fine-\ntuned to be trained for other tasks provided by the final user. For classification purposes, BERT takes an array of tokens representing a sentence and a mask that helps it determine how long the sentence is. If fine-\ntuning is used for classification, BERT will learn and update its internal model at the same time as the classifier learns.\nBERT has many variants depending on its configuration. In [21], two configurations are proposed for the transformer: namely, BERT-base and BERT-large. The one used in this work is BERT-base, a model with 12 transformer blocks, 768 hidden layers, 12 self-attention heads and 110 million parameters. BERT-large, a larger version of the model, was tested for this study but resulted in only marginally better results at the cost of far longer processing times.\nBERT is composed of 6 identical layers. In turn, each of these layers is composed of a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. It uses a residual connection [22] to connect both sub-layers followed by a layer normalization [23].\nIn relation to multi-head self-attention, first, we need to define scaled dot-product attention. It is defined as follows:\n$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\\frac{QKT}{dk}) V$\nwhere Q is the matrix of queries, K is the matrix of keys, V is the matrix of values and dk is the dimension of the Q and K matrices. Now, we can define multi-head attention as follows:"}, {"title": "3.2 Logistic regression", "content": "Logistic regression is a kind of regression analysis used to predict the outcome of a categorical/discrete/binary variable based on the independent variables provided. It is a useful way of modeling the probability of an event happening as a function of other factors. Logistic regression analysis falls within the framework of Generalized Linear Models (GLM). It can be used in combination with some other ML techniques to classify non-binary categorical variables. The logistic function provides the probability of an event belonging to a category and takes the form:\n$p(X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta.x)}}$\nwhere X is a vector representing a sample and \u03b2 is a vector of model coefficients to be learned by the model [27].\nLogistic regression classifiers need to be trained before we can use them. Training a logistic regressor means feeding it with training data so it can learn \u03b2, an internal representation that minimizes the training error. This training set has the same form as the data we intend to classify in the future, plus a label; this is the solution, or the piece of data that we want the classifier to predict. After training, the logistic regressor can model the expected output as a function of the input. Once our classifier is trained, we can feed it with non-labeled data and obtain predictions of the label. This kind of ML is called supervised learning."}, {"title": "4. Proposed model", "content": "To achieve our goals, we propose a model based on CRISP-DM [28]. This model is shown in Fig.1"}, {"title": "4.1 Business Understanding", "content": "The objective is to obtain a model that can be used to predict the taxonomic category of an event based on its title and description.\nOur system must be able to take a piece of text and classify that text belonging to an event given a fixed set of taxonomic categories.\nA taxonomy is a specific classification scheme that expresses the overall similarity between organisms, entities and/or things in a hierarchical fashion [29]. Items sharing similarities are first grouped into populations. According to [7], a product hierarchy extends from basic needs to items that satisfy those needs. In our case, part of the business understanding step is understanding the need to classify events in a taxonomy that is useful to the sector.\nThis is a very interesting feature for tourism industry players such as airlines. In our example, a particular airline flies to 20+ countries and 50+ cities. This airline wants to provide an inspirational service that allows users to browse the tourist events in those cities, and hopefully encourages them to buy a ticket if the event catalog impresses them enough. The catalog should be filterable by type of event; hence, all events should belong to at least one taxonomic category. This airline cannot use an aggregated catalog since events collected from hundreds of different sources and happening in 20+ different countries do not share the same classification criteria, if any have been assigned. Instead, they will use a hierarchical taxonomy to classify the events that they present to their clients."}, {"title": "4.2 Data Understanding", "content": "Data understanding can be divided into four tasks:\n\u2022\tDetermine what data we need\n\u2022\tCollect data\n\u2022\tExplore data\n\u2022\tQuality Assurance (QA)\nFirst, we had to determine what data we needed; for our problem, it was a set of records representing events. Since our goal is to predict the taxonomic category of an event based on its title and description, we had to collect title and description as independent variables and assign a label with an identifier of its taxonomic category as a dependent variable.\nThe next step was to collect the data. To do so, we created a series of data collectors able to ingest large amounts of data. These data collectors fetch data from very different sources such as APIs, RSS feeds, data aggregators and more than 1000 websites from more than 30 countries in 22 different languages. Since the raw data from those sources are not evenly structured, we used a NoSQL database to store the results. We built this process iteratively for six years and collected millions of events with rich data that go beyond title and description.\nData exploration was an important part of the work. Data exploration showed that many events we were collecting could be aggregated by language, country, region, venue, date, etc. Since this collection continued over a span of six years, we could modify the system to expedite some sources, build new ones if needed and react to collection results.\nAfter collecting the data, we observed that our records were unbalanced due to the heterogeneous nature of the events catalog. In Fig. 4 we can see that that we had twice as many events with id 0 (music) as some of the other taxonomic categories in our set.\nQA was performed periodically to check that information was consistent and we were collecting quality data. There were some automatic measures in place to ensure only valid events were ingested."}, {"title": "4.3 Data Preparation", "content": "Data preparation can be divided into three tasks:\n\u2022\tData cleaning\n\u2022\tFeature engineering\n\u2022\tData integration\nData cleaning is necessary when collecting a high volume of data directly from the web. The process must deal with multilingual texts and issues such as HTML contamination or formatting issues. Most of these issues are solved by erasing common HTML symbols or expressions, non-ASCII characters, email addresses or most punctuation characters.\nAnother important data transformation is translation. In our case, if an original event was not in English, we had to automatically translate it since the BERT model that we used is optimized for the English language. Data integration happened naturally in our system since we matched venues, events, performers, languages, countries, and regions in a relational database. A crucial step in this process was to label events with a category and a second level category, for which we used different techniques:\n\u2022\tSome of the events came from sites that only dealt with one taxonomic category of events and hence they were automatically labeled. For example, if one of our second level taxonomic categories was football and we collected events from a source that only lists football-related events, we labeled those events as football when collecting them.\n\u2022\tSome of the events came from reputed sites with some taxonomic categories that exactly matched some of ours. In such cases we were able to label events using a simple data mapping.\n\u2022\tA large amount of data was labeled manually by data analysts.\nOur list of first level taxonomic categories is shown in Fig. 6.\nAt this point, after completing these tasks, we ended up with 700,000 events with a clean title and description and labeled according to our taxonomy structure.\nSince we wanted to feed BERT with only one text string per event and the maximum number of words that we can use without further modifications to the model is 510, we concatenated title, a blank character, and description and trimmed it to 510 words. This will affect some of our events, but it does not seem to affect classification accuracy. In Fig. 7 a probability distribution of our dataset is shown. We can see that the most common cases are events with short texts."}, {"title": "4.4 Modeling", "content": "After finishing the data preparation, the next step was to build a model that allowed us to classify events."}, {"title": "4.4.1 Training", "content": "To train our model, we had to train a classifier able to predict the taxonomic category of the event. Then we needed to train more classifiers capable of determining the second level taxonomic category of the event. We trained one of those second level classifiers for each taxonomy. The internal architecture of each classifier was the same; to build different classifiers we fed the training process with different data.\nThe overall training process of our classifier entailed sending events to be predicted (forward pass), comparing prediction with ground truth to get a classification error and sending that error back so the network could minimize it (backpropagation). The network in our case was formed by hundreds of layers provided by the BERT model and one layer for the logistic classifier.\nIn the forward pass, we sent an event to the classifier. The input of each classifier when training included the event text, a mask indicating the length of the text and the label of the event. Our text was then sent to a tokenizer that produced the tokens that BERT can consume. The output of BERT was a 768-length vector with a representation of the input text. That vector was fed into a multiclass logistic regression classifier that produced an array with probabilities, one per taxonomic category. Finally, the softmax activation function was applied to the output vector, which picked the largest probability and returned the most probable taxonomic category.\nHaving obtained a prediction, the system sent the classification error back to the network in a process called backpropagation. Then both the logistic regression classifier and BERT learned by trying to minimize that error.\nWe repeated this forward and back propagation with all the events in our training set, and then repeated the entire operation for 4 epochs. The output of this process was a model that we can store and retrieve to classify events."}, {"title": "4.4.2 Predicting", "content": "To classify an event, we sent it to the BERT-based classifier that we trained in the previous step and thus determined its taxonomic category, e.g. Sport.\nA BERT-based classifier receives a clean string of text up to 510 characters in length which is then tokenized using the appropriate tokenizer. These tokens are fed into the BERT model that produces a vector representation of the event text. That vector goes through a trained logistic regression and a softmax activation function that returns the category or second level category.\nWe can see the workflow of our classifier in Fig. 10."}, {"title": "4.5 Evaluation", "content": "We evaluated our model using 173,184 events. These 173,184 events were stratified since the original training dataset was unbalanced. For this dataset we obtained an accuracy of 0.87.\nTo obtain that accuracy we generated a table with the logit odds of each sentence, which represented the likelihood of each event belonging to each taxonomic category. We added a column with the taxonomy id with the highest odds and considered that our prediction. This is shown in Fig. 11, where the odds are shown in the numerical columns."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "We built a hierarchical NLP model that assigns a fixed set of taxonomic categories to tourist events. This model allows us to normalize events so we can build a catalog that is useful to tourism industry players such as airlines, travel agencies or hotel chains.\nWith a normalized catalog we can use consistent search filters independently of the source, origin language or geographical location. It is especially useful for travelers during the inspirational phase of their trip-planning. We obtained an accuracy of 0.87; thus, combined with other classification techniques, our model can produce a quality catalog for the tourism sector.\nConcluding with our use case, an airline can use this catalog to know what events are happening in its regions of interest and can provide services where users can filter events by various different criteria. The airline can build its own catalog based on the general one; for example, if it takes a complete catalog showing all published events from our sources, the airline may choose not to show some of the taxonomic categories. Some interested parties may not want to show the second level taxonomic category \u201calcohol and beverages\u201d. Once we have a catalog with all target events classified and filtered, the airline may use it in different ways:\n\u2022\tIt could build an application to show some taxonomic categories across its destinations, to help travelers in their inspirational phase\n\u2022\tIt could filter some interesting events for a specific destination if it wants to promote that route\n\u2022\tIt could tailor and personalize the catalog for its clients if it knows their preferences."}, {"title": "6. Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "This work addresses a significant challenge in the tourism industry: the lack of a unified and normalized catalog of events. Most of the related literature proposes taxonomies or typologies for events, but does not describe how to apply them or how to assign them to existing events. The novelty of our research lies in the proposal of a practical solution to automatically classify events using a fixed set of taxonomic categories, shifting the burden from event organizers and listing sites to event aggregators. To our knowledge, our study is the first to specifically tackle this problem.\nWe built a BERT-based classifier which was able to assign taxonomic categories to an event catalog using only titles and descriptions of events. We trained this classifier with 700,000 events and tested it with 173,175 labeled events. In the future, we can experiment with other variants of BERT. We can also allow events to belong to multiple categories to prevent issues with overlap, or we can generate taxonomic categories that are easier to separate completely.\nFrom the economic point of view, companies need normalized event catalogs for multiple reasons. In this study, we use the example of an airline providing a normalized catalog for events in many cities, in many different languages, and from very different sources, to help travelers in the inspirational phase. A future line of work can focus on other analyses, such as the prediction of venue occupation, hotel occupation or transport usage."}]}

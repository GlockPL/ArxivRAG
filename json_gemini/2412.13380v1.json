{"title": "Voter Priming Campaigns: Strategies, Equilibria, and Algorithms", "authors": ["Jonathan Shaki", "Yonatan Aumann", "Sarit Kraus"], "abstract": "Issue salience is a major determinant in voters' decisions. Candidates and political parties campaign to shift salience to their advantage - a process termed priming. We study the dynamics, strategies and equilibria of campaign spending for voter priming in multi-issue multi-party settings. We consider both parliamentary elections, where parties aim to maximize their share of votes, and various settings for presidential elections, where the winner takes all. For parliamentary elections, we show that pure equilibrium spending always exists and can be computed in time linear in the number of voters. For two parties and all settings, a spending equilibrium exists such that each party invests only in a single issue, and an equilibrium can be computed in time that is polynomial in the number of issues and linear in the number of voters. We also show that in most presidential settings no equilibrium exists. Additional properties of optimal campaign strategies are also studied.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Political parties and candidates invest substantial resources in campaigns aimed at winning over voters. Interestingly, research reveals that these campaigns often do not directly alter voters' views or attitudes toward candidates and issues. Rather, campaigns tend to influence the relative salience of various topics, thereby shaping the importance voters assign to these issues (Moniz and Wlezien 2020; Macdonald 2023; Druckman 2004). Consequently, an essential element in political campaigns involves strategically guiding the salience of issues to the candidates' advantage, a process known in political science as priming (Bartels 2006). Political campaigns are costly, and candidates have limited budgets. Thus, from a strategic perspective, the question is how to best invest the available campaign budget in order to obtain the most beneficial priming for a given candidate, and whether an equilibrium investment profile exists. From a computational perspective, the question is how to compute the optimal and equilibrium investments, if they exist. These are the topics of this paper.\nThe importance of issue salience in voting has recently gained attention in the context of election control and manipulation (Lu et al. 2019; Estornell et al. 2020). In these works, priming is viewed in the context of election manipulation and hence assumed to be limited to a single malicious actor. We view priming in the context of campaigning and study equilibria thereof."}, {"title": "Summary of Results", "content": "We consider two core settings, which we term parliamentary and presidential. In the parliamentary setting, parties aim to maximize their share of votes. In the presidential case, the primary goal is to be ranked first. For the presidential setting, we consider several variants, which relate to a possible secondary goal of increasing the share of votes. The different variants, formally defined in detail in Section 2, are: (i) $U_{ind}$: the sole goal is to be ranked first, with no secondary goal, (ii) $U_{plus}$: a weighted average the goal of being ranked first and increasing the share of votes, with the weight highly skewed towards the former, (iii) $U_{max}$: the primary goal is to be ranked first, only if this cannot be achieved then increasing the share is considered as a goal, with significantly lesser utility. Throughout, we consider plurality ballot form, wherein each voter casts one vote for its most favorable candidate/party (Meir et al. 2010).\nFor each setting and variant, we consider the question of whether a Nash equilibrium necessarily exists and whether, knowing the strategies of the other players, a best-response necessarily exists. Our main results are summarised in Table 1. For the parliamentary setting, both a Nash equilibrium (in pure strategies) and best-response always exist. When there are only two candidates, it is further the case that in equilibrium each candidate invests its entire budget in priming of a single issue. For the presidential setting, for both variants that include a secondary goal, a Nash equilibrium need not exist in the general case, and not even a best-response. For the variant where the sole goal is winning, with no other considerations, a best response does exists, and we do not know if a Nash equilibrium necessarily exists. We note, however, that the Nash equilibria in this variant may be unnatural, in the sense that they require candidates to invest not for their own good, but rather for the benefit of others. In all presidential variants, if there are only two candidates, an equilibrium exists wherein each candidate without such a secondary goal, unnatural behavior can emerge wherein candidates invest against their own good."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Campaign management and bribery have been researched extensively in the literature (see (Schlotter, Faliszewski, and Elkind 2011; Faliszewski et al. 2015; Knop, Kouteck\u1ef3, and Mnich 2020; Zagoury et al. 2021). And for extensive review see (Simpser 2013; Islam, Mohajan, and Moolio 2010)). Both these terms refer to a setting where individual voters are influenced to alter their vote, and the main question is how to choose these voters. We consider situations where changing voters' decision-making is only possible by general campaign messages, which alter the importance of different issues.\nAd delivery algorithms also aim to change voters' actions. They promise to lower the cost of advertising and increase the efficiency of campaigns through detailed targeting, where advertisers can specify the users they would like to reach using attributes (Danaher 2023; Kreiss 2011). However, it was shown (e.g., (Ali et al. 2021; Cotter et al. 2021)) that targeting may not work as intended, and may shape the political ad delivery in ways that may not be beneficial to the political campaigns and to societal discourse.\nCampaign communications that direct voter attention to the considerations that campaigns emphasize are termed 'priming'. This phenomenon has been studied repeatedly over the years in many contexts (from psychology (Kuzyakov, Friedel, and Stahr 2000; Molden 2014) to natural language processing (Shaki, Kraus, and Wooldridge 2023; Zhou, Frank, and McCoy 2024)). Regarding elections, Matthews (Matthews 2019) showed clear evidence of issue priming throughout six US national elections. Macdonald (Macdonald 2023) showed that citizens' core values are less affected by campaign-related priming effects, supporting our approach that the effect of investing in priming depends on the issue.\nIn (Hillygus and Shields 2008)[Chapter. 1] the importance of wedge issues is discussed, showing the possibility to attract attention to topics that are less important and even those that are not the strongest of the candidates.\nThere are several works that model the utility of voters, which take issues' importance into consideration. For example, in (Kollman, Miller, and Page 2018)'s model, termed spatial elections, each voter attaches both a weight and an aspired value to each of the issues, and every candidate has a position on every issue. Each voter votes for the candidate with minimal weighted Euclidean distance between its positions and the voter's ideal positions. They consider the problem of finding the optimal positions for candidates in order to maximize their votes.\n(Lu et al. 2019) consider issue salience priming/manipulation in the spatial preference framework. assuming a single primer/manipulator. They consider the case of binary salience, and a manipulator that can determine which issues the voters care about and which not. Voters vote deterministically to the candidate who is closest to them (on the salient issues). (Lu et al. 2019) view priming (which they term control by manipulation) as a type of attack by a malicious entity, and hence only consider priming by a single entity. The paper derives strongly negative results, and concludes that computing effective manipulation is hard even for two candidates, or for a single voter.\n(Estornell et al. 2020) extend (Lu et al. 2019) and consider issue priming in the setting of weighted spatial preferences (rather than binary), and a manipulator that is constrained by a budget (for shifting the weights). They consider both the deterministic setting - where the voter necessarily votes for the closest candidate - and stochastic settings - where the probability of voting for a candidate is monotone in the weighted distance, and both the parliamentary and the presidential elections (which they term MaxSupport and Majority Vote). Following (Lu et al. 2019), (Estornell et al. 2020) consider only a single manipulator. They show that in the most general setting, the control problem is NP-hard, but that the stochastic setting - which is the more similar to ours - is tractable if the probability of voting for a candidate is linear in their weighted distance from the voter (there are also versions of the deterministic setting that are tractable).\nOur work differs from (Estornell et al. 2020) and (Lu et al. 2019) in several ways. Our voter preference model strictly subsumes the spatial model. On the other hand, we only consider the stochastic case and assume that the probabilities are linear in the relative weighted distances (which corresponds to the stochastic setting for which the problem is tractable). More importantly, we consider the strategic setting where priming is performed by multiple candidates in the race and seek an equilibrium in such a setting - a topic not considered in (Estornell et al. 2020) and (Lu et al. 2019) at all.\n(Denter 2020) considers the problem of campaign investment management in a setting where campaigns have two simultaneous effects: (i) Persuasion: increasing the quality of the policy in the issue as perceived by the voters through policy advertising and (ii) Priming: making the issue more salient, thereby increasing the issue's perceived importance (as in our model). The paper considers only the case of two candidates and two issues, and does not provide any algorithms. We note that the exact model of how campaigns alter the salience is somewhat different between our model and that of (Denter 2020), which leads to different results concerning the existence of an equilibrium."}, {"title": "Model", "content": "We consider the following stylized model.

The proof is by that of Theorem 1.2 in (Fudenberg and Tirole 1991), and similar to the standard proof of the Nash's theorem (e.g. Theorem 1.1 in the same work).\nThe strategies space are indeed convex, as the only constrain for every candidate c is that $\\sum_{i\\in I} w_i = W^c$, and it's easy to see that the utility of every candidate is continuous in the investments of all the candidates.\nAlthough the utility of every candidate is not quasi-concave, this requirement is used in the proof only to show that the optimal responses of every candidate are convex. Indeed, say that there are two best responses, one involves a set J of issues with positive investments and the other a set K. Then, by Theorem 3 every focus investment in any issue in JUK is a best response. Then, by the same theorem any split investment in these issues is, hence the best responses are convex.  \nFinding the Equilibrium. By Theorem 4, a pure equilibrium always exists. We explain how to find it.\nIn a pure equilibrium, every candidate c strictly invests in a set $I^c \\subseteq I$ of issues.

Notably, in all cases where an equilibrium is guaranteed to exist, it takes the form of a pure equilibrium. This outcome simplifies theoretical analysis and computational implementation, offering a clear framework for predicting candidate behavior. Pure equilibria allow candidates to adopt intuitive strategies, eliminating the need for probabilistic approaches that are harder to interpret.\nDespite this, the results reveal certain counterintuitive aspects of the model that merit closer examination. In particular, the analysis establishes that in the two-candidate setting equilibrium in single-issue investments always exists. This result, while mathematically sound, diverges from real-world observations where candidates typically distribute their campaign budget across multiple issues. The divergence may be due to the linearity assumption in the model, creating incentives for candidates to concentrate all resources on a single issue. A more realistic model could postulate diminishing returns on salience investment, which would encourage a more balanced allocation of resources. We leave the study of such a model to future research.\nAnother promising avenue for future work is to consider scenarios where candidates invest resources not only in priming voter attention on specific issues but also in improving their perceived quality on the different issues. This addition would provide a richer framework that captures the interplay between issue salience and perceived candidate quality, reflecting a broader range of campaign strategies observed in practice."}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": ""}, {"title": "Proofs from Section 2", "content": ""}, {"title": "Proofs from Section 3", "content": ""}, {"title": "Proofs from Section 4", "content": ""}, {"title": "Reviewer 1", "content": "We acknowledge that some results appear non-intuitive and believe that this paper can serve as a foundation for more complex settings where such results may not hold, like models with diminishing returns on campaign investments or scenarios involving multiple voting regions under a single campaign.

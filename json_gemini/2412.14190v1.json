We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI, a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss, and devaluing the \u2018new' Al relative to the \u2018original'. Experimental evidence confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a loss of their Al companion more than a loss of various other inanimate products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.\n\nThe development of large language models (LLMs) and generative artificial intelligence (AI) has not only led to many new business applications (e.g., search, education software), but also enabled a new class of chatbots that has the potential to be used for building \u2018synthetic' social relationships, which we refer to as Al companions. An increasing number of consumers use this technology to satisfy social goals (Broadbent et al. 2023; Chaturvedi et al. 2023; De Freitas et al. 2023). For example, Replika is a chatbot, with over two million active users, that is", "sections": [{"title": "Consumer Relevance and Contribution Statement", "content": "Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI, a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. First, we contribute to nascent work on Al companions (Pentina, Hancock, and Xie 2023; Xie and Pentina 2022; Xie, Pentina, and Hancock 2023). Consumers who use Al companions rate these relationships as closer, and their levels of mourning a loss of the relationship as stronger, than for other products and brands in their lives. This suggest that the kind of relationships consumers are forming with these products are more personal. Second, we extend existing accounts of parasocial interactions to relationships with AI, and add the notion of identity discontinuity as a cause of negative reactions. Previous work on parasocial relationships has focused on celebrities (Cohen 2004; Eyal and Cohen 2006; Lather and Moyer- Guse 2011), and found reactions related to loss when a movie or TV series ends, or when access to an avatar terminates (Pearce 2011). We find that similar reactions can arise even when the AI has not technically been terminated, by triggering perceptions of identity discontinuity. Third, we contribute back to psychological literature on personal identity and relationships, by studying how consumers think of the persisting identity of AI. Psychological work on personal identity has focused on understanding how people keep track of the identity continuity of individual persons (Strohminger and Nichols 2014). We show a similar psychology is at play when tracking certain Als."}, {"title": "An App Update at Replika \u0391\u0399", "content": "Here we study customers of Replika, one of the most popular AI companion apps available on the iPhone Operating System (iOS), Android, and web interfaces. Replika utilizes a combination of different modeling approaches, including LLMs, to provide caring, emotionally- laden responses to users (De Freitas and Tempest Keller 2022). Its typical users consist of people from a range of age groups who want to be more social, do not have a lot of offline friends, live in small towns, are going through hard times (e.g., a family loss), do not fit in socially (e.g.,"}, {"title": "Related Research", "content": "The large userbase and commercial success that Replika enjoys, suggest that many consumers find significant value in interacting with such bots. Early academic research has begun characterizing such interactions, suggesting that consumers do indeed form close emotional relationships with their AI companions. Table W1 (Web Appendix A) summarizes the published research most related to ours, highlighting how our research contributes to this nascent body of work studying AI companions. These studies consistently highlight that AI companions can significantly influence users' emotional well-being. Users often develop meaningful connections with Al companions, finding companionship and emotional support, which helps reduce feelings of loneliness and enhance positive emotions. For instance, Replika users report experiencing emotional benefits such as reduced loneliness and increased well-being (Skjuve et al. 2021; Ta et al. 2020) and even reduced suicidal ideation (Maples et al. 2024). This positive emotional impact is sometimes coupled with concerns about emotional dependence, where users become reliant on AI companions for emotional stability, potentially exacerbating feelings of"}, {"title": "Hypothesis Development", "content": "To guide our study of consumers' relationships with AI companions, we build on well- established theories of human relationship development. First, we apply research from social psychology on perceived identity to the domain of human-AI relationships, proposing that people who are in relationships with Als like Replika track the perceived identity of their companion over time and that certain types of changes to that identity are likely to trigger the perception that the companion has fundamentally deteriorated, leading to both mental health harms and devaluation of the offering. We then explore the closeness of the relationships underlying these reactions, and how they compare to various other entities. Finally, we outline"}, {"title": "Identity continuity in relationships", "content": "We argue that the perceived continuity of an AI companion's identity is a key factor in determining the well-being of consumers in relationships with AI companions. In this context, \u2018identity continuity' refers to the perceived consistency of the AI's behavior over time. We hypothesize that identity continuity is crucial for developing and maintaining a relationship with an Al companion, since perceived continuity provides a sense of understanding who the AI is and of being able to predict how it will react in different situations, enabling trust and the formation of emotional bonds.\n\nIn literature on social psychology, consumer behavior, and economics, an \u2018identity' refers specifically to a social category of which one is a member. However, an extensive literature from cognitive psychology and empirical philosophy has studied people's beliefs about an individual entity's identity, which consists of individual-level psychological traits (like memory, personality, and morality) that are not necessarily related to social categories (De Freitas et al. 2017a; Molouki et al. 2020; Strohminger and Nichols 2014). From a young age, consumers track the continuity of another individual's identity over time, i.e., whether the individual entity at t0 is the same individual at t1. This theme of identity continuity extends to consumer behavior. Consumers with less clarity about who they are tend to avoid making decisions that might cause a sense of identity discontinuity, such as discontinuing a recurring subscription (Savary and Dhar 2020). Further, research on heritage branding suggests that consumers can react negatively when brands change or enhance their original products; even if improved, the new versions are viewed less favorably due to a sense of lost authenticity to the original version over time (Han et al."}, {"title": "H1: Changes to an AI companion can negatively impact the users' mental health,\nbecause they are viewed as a loss of the \u2018original' AI.", "content": "Experiencing such a sudden and significant change in an AI companion's identity may not only harm the users' well-being, however. It may also have negative downstream implications for the firm that produces and markets the product. For instance, Reddit posts suggest that Replika users often express anger at Replika's parent firm (Laestadius et al. 2022). We propose that users who are mourning the loss of their AI companion's previous identity are to not only be angry at the firm producing the AI, but, because they view the new companion as discontinuous with the original, they devalue it compared to how much they valued it in the past.\n\nH2: Changes to an AI companion's perceived identity that negatively impact users' mental health also have further downstream consequences for the firm's marketing efforts, leading consumers to devalue the new offering relative to the original.\n\nWe do not expect that these effects are limited only to changes in ERP behavior. Rather, we hypothesize that other types of changes to an Al companion's identity that impact its social relationship with the user produce similar effects. For example, if the AI companion suddenly becomes colder in its interaction style, this change may also impact consumers' perceptions about the continuity of their companion's identity. Thus, changes that impact the social relationship are likely to significantly impact consumers' relationship with the AI, potentially leading to the downstream consequences of mourning the loss of the original Al companion (mental well-being outcome) and devaluing the new offering relative to the original (marketing consequences). In addition to measuring each of these constructs directly, we also measure sub- constructs related to them, including the following for mourning: low mental health symptoms, low mental well-being, and expressions of the negative emotions of sadness and fear; and the"}, {"title": "Are Relationships with AI Special?", "content": "The idea that people experience close yet one-sided relationships has been documented since the 1950's, when researchers found that some people felt as if they were in a relationship with characters on television or radio, and coined this phenomenon a parasocial relationship (Horton and Wohl 1956). For example, TV viewers sometimes react to their favorite character being written out of a TV show as if they had lost a friend or even a romantic partner (Cohen 2004).\n\nAt first glance, human relationships with AI-powered chatbots appear to fit squarely within this phenomenon of parasocial relationships, insofar as people are experiencing close relationships that are, in a sense, one-sided: there is no human on the other side of the screen that reciprocates in a fundamental sense. However, chatbots like Replika differ in important ways from characters on a TV show or other targets of parasocial relationships. Most importantly, such chatbots are deeply interactive, and they respond immediately and with apparent care to all messages they receive. Although consumers might feel a close sense of connection to their favorite celebrity or fictional character, the never actually interact with that celebrity or character.

Prior work has identified what types of identity change lead to the perception that a person has fundamentally changed, but has not examined the impacts of such changes on mental health and marketing outcomes like we do and has not studied how the impacts of such changes depend on relationship investments. Furthermore, our focus on the type of changes extends work on parasocial relationships, which has examined the \"breakups\u201d of such relationships, but not the impacts of changes to the identity of the relationship \u201cpartner.\u201d Finally, we also contribute theoretically by testing whether established theories of human-human relationships, including the Investment Model, can extend to and predict outcomes in human-AI relationships."}, {"title": "Study 1: ERP Removal", "content": "Study 1 examines archived Reddit posts to explore Replika users' sentiments before and after the removal of the ERP feature.

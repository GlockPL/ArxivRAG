INTRODUCTION", "content": "The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and argumentation has emerged as a new platform, promising to reform debates, improve critical thinking, and foster more informed discourse. As language models become increasingly sophisticated, their potential as intelligent debate partners and argumentation assistants has captured the imagination of researchers and educators. This paper introduces DebateBrawl, a novel system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debate platform.\nHowever, current AI-powered debate systems face several critical challenges that limit their effectiveness as educational and practice tools. First, while LLMs excel at generating fluent responses, they lack strategic depth in extended debates, often failing to maintain consistent argumentation strategies across multiple exchanges. Second, existing systems typically operate with fixed response patterns, unable to adapt to different debate styles or learn from past interactions. Third, most platforms lack sophisticated planning capabilities needed to anticipate and effectively counter opponent arguments. These limitations result in debate experiences that, while technologically advanced, fail to provide the dynamic, adaptive, and educational interaction necessary for meaningful debate practice. DebateBrawl addresses these fundamental challenges through a novel integration of three complementary technologies: LLMs for natural language understanding and generation, Genetic Algorithms for strategic evolution and adaptation, and Adversarial Search for predictive planning and counter-argument generation.\nThe development of transformer-based language models, based on GPT architectures, has marked a paradigm shift in natural language processing [1]. These models, trained on vast corpora of text, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent, context-aware text across diverse domains. However, while LLMs excel at generating fluent and contextually relevant responses, they often lack the strategic depth and adaptability required for nuanced, multi-turn debates. This limitation stems from their fundamentally reactive nature, where responses are generated based on immediate context rather than long-term strategic planning [2].\nDebateBrawl addresses this challenge by incorporating genetic algorithms and adversarial search techniques. Genetic algorithms, inspired by natural selection and evolution, have proven effective in optimizing complex, multi-dimensional problems [3]. In the context of debate, GAs evolve and refine argumentation strategies over time, adapting to the specific topic, opponent, and flow of the debate. This evolutionary approach allows the system to discover and hone effective combinations of rhetorical devices, logical structures, and persuasive techniques.\nAdversarial search provides a framework for anticipating and planning responses to potential counterarguments [4]. By simulating possible debate trajectories and evaluating their outcomes, AS enables the system to make more informed decisions about argument selection and presentation. In DebateBrawl, this is made possible through a debate move predictor that anticipates opponent strategies and suggests effective counter-moves. The synergy between GAs and AS creates a debate engine that can not only generate coherent arguments but also strategically plan its approach to maximize persuasiveness and effectiveness.\nThe integration of LLMs, GAs, and AS in DebateBrawl represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted argumentation systems. Previous work in this field has primarily focused on argument mining [5], stance detection [6], and automated fact-checking [7]. While these approaches have made valuable contributions to computational argumentation, they often operate on a more granular level, focusing on individual arguments or claims rather than the holistic process of debate. DebateBrawl builds upon these foundations but takes a more comprehensive approach, addressing the full lifecycle of a debate from argument generation to strategic planning and adaptive response.\nThe development of DebateBrawl is motivated by the growing recognition of the importance of critical thinking and argumentation skills in education and public discourse. In an era characterized by information overload and rapid spread of misinformation, the ability to construct, analyze, and evaluate arguments is more crucial than ever [8]. Traditional debate training methods, while valuable, are often limited by resource constraints and the availability of skilled human opponents and coaches."}, {"title": "II.

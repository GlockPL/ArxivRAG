Lyu"], "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Extended Reality (XR, encompassing AR, MR, and VR) and spatial computing technologies forms a foundational layer for the emerging Metaverse, enabling innovative applications across healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment. However, research in this area is often limited by the lack of large, representative, and high-quality application datasets that can support empirical studies and the development of new approaches benefiting XR software processes. In this paper, we introduce XRZOO, a comprehensive and curated dataset of XR applications designed to bridge this gap. XRZOO contains 12,528 free XR applications, spanning nine app stores, across all XR techniques (i.e., AR, MR, and VR) and use cases, with detailed metadata on key aspects such as application descriptions, application categories, release dates, user review numbers, and hardware specifications, etc. By making XRZOO publicly available, we aim to foster reproducible XR software engineering and security research, enable cross-disciplinary investigations, and also support the development of advanced XR systems by providing examples to developers. Our dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in improving the scalability, usability, and effectiveness of XR applications. XRZOO will be released and actively maintained.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Extended Reality (XR) applications encompass Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) applications, relying on spatial computing [1] to deliver immersive and interactive user experiences [2]. They form a critical foundation for the emerging Metaverse [3], a convergence of physical and virtual spaces facilitated by spatial computing. Such applications leverage sophisticated hardware devices such as head-mounted displays (HMDs), motion sensors, and real-time environmental mapping to enable users to interact with digital content in physical and virtual space. The three reality technologies differ in their degree of interaction with the physical world: VR fully immerses users in a simulated environment, AR overlays digital information onto the physical world while maintaining user presence in reality, and MR integrates real and virtual elements in real-time, enabling dynamic interaction between the two.\nAdvancements in XR applications help drive the surge in global market size, with the size reaching $54.58 billion in 2024 and being projected to reach $100.77 billion by 2026 [4]. These applications have revolutionized numerous domains, including healthcare, education, manufacturing, and entertainment [5]. For instance, in healthcare, XR applications enable surgical simulations and remote diagnostics, while in education, immersive environments enhance interactive learning experiences. Similarly, in manufacturing, XR has facilitated advanced training simulations and real-time collaboration across geographies.\nThe increasing importance of XR applications makes it urgent to conduct software engineering (SE) research, facilitating the reliability and efficiency of the whole software process from design, implementation, testing, and maintenance [6]. Many researchers have been drawn to address XR software challenges across diverse domains, such as automated interactive testing [7], [8], bug detection [9], [10], and static/dynamic analysis (e.g., for privacy auditing) [11], [12]. Similar to research in conventional software domains, the primary obstacle lies in subject collection. Due to the fragmentation issues of the dispersed XR ecosystems, diversified development technology stacks and competing hardware platforms, the platform-specific restrictions on accessing XR applications and associated data hinder the ability to collect comprehensive datasets, making the lack of large-scale, comprehensive, accessible, and high-quality datasets that span the diverse array of XR platforms and application categories. As a result, researchers often resort to reusing limited datasets (has risks of being outdated) or collecting small, non-representative samples. Such approaches can lead to biased analyses and experiments that are difficult to reproduce, thereby limiting the generalizability and impact of research in this domain.\nThe datasets with great usability in other software domains, including mobile apps [13]\u2013[15], video games [16], and microservices [17], etc., inspires us to fill the gap. In this paper, we introduce XRZOO, the first large-scale curated dataset that comprehensively covers XR applications across different application categories, ecosystems, technology stacks, and hardware platforms. To facilitate reproducibility and ease of access, we present a well-documented methodology for collecting, processing, and curating the dataset. The data collection faces significant challenges in ensuring data quality, completeness, and accuracy due to technical and platform-specific constraints. These include the diversity of XR platforms, which require sophisticated filtering algorithms to identify XR applications, especially on general-purpose stores that lack explicit categorization. Data crawling is further complicated by limited API support and access restrictions, necessitating"}, {"title": "II. DATA COLLECTION ARCHITECTURE", "content": "To build XRZoo, we collect from multiple mainstream marketplaces that host XR applications. Our goal is to cover a diverse and comprehensive set of XR applications that can be retrieved freely. Specifically, we target marketplaces across XR-specific app stores, general-purpose game app stores, and mobile phone app stores. We try our best to go through all mainstream marketplaces and determine nine app stores at last. The selection criteria are the following: (1) The marketplace hosts XR applications that cannot be found elsewhere (some app stores are only collections of the original marketplaces). (2) The marketplace has active users (e.g., have reasonable numbers of application downloads or user reviews). Table I summarizes the app stores crawled for XRZOO, along with the corresponding devices in the XR ecosystem that are supported by the dataset.\nFor XR-specific app stores, which primarily host XR applications, we collect all their available free applications. These app stores are specialized platforms, mainly maintained by XR device manufacturers, to promote the XR software ecosystem. These stores consist of\nMeta Quest App Store (and Meta Quest App Lab), VIVE- PORT, and SideQuest. These are the most popular domain-specific platforms for XR content distribution.\nSpecifically, Meta Horizon Store is the primary distribution platform for XR devices from Meta, the world's leading XR company. Meta Horizon App Lab serves as an alternative distribution channel for Quest applications that have not undergone the full curation process required for the main store. It enables developers to distribute experimental or early-access content directly to users. The Vision Pro App Store is a specialized marketplace designed to host MR applications optimized for immersive spatial computing experiences on the Vision Pro device. VIVEPORT is a comprehensive VR content platform developed by HTC. VIVEPORT applications can be accessed by standalone XR devices via a PC connection (e.g., using Meta Quest Link). SideQuest is a third-party platform facilitating the sideloading of applications onto Meta Quest devices, SideQuest serves as an early access layer for XR content, enabling developers to distribute applications outside the official Meta ecosystem.\nStores on Windows: Steam, being one of the largest platforms for digital distribution of games, hosts a wide range of VR applications. Microsoft's HoloLens utilizes the Microsoft Store as its application distribution platform, providing a range of MR applications tailored for enterprise and developer use.\nPhone App Stores: Google Play and iOS App Store are prominent mobile application marketplaces that host a wide range of applications, including VR/AR applications that can be accessed on mobile phones."}, {"title": "B. Collection Challenges and Our Solutions", "content": "The collection of XRZOO presents several challenges that require careful consideration to ensure data quality, completeness, and accuracy. These challenges stem from both technical constraints and platform-specific limitations as follows.\nOne of the primary challenges in collecting XR applications is the inherent diversity across the platforms hosting these applications. While the number of XR platforms continues to grow, each platform presents unique challenges in terms of crawling methods, data accessibility, metadata completeness, and application categorization, etc. For instance, VR-specific platforms like Meta Quest and VIVEPORT offer a more direct pathway to identifying XR applications. Additionally, app stores with broader content, such as Microsoft Store, Steam, and mobile app stores, require precise filtering mechanisms to isolate XR applications from a large pool of non-XR games. This necessitated the development of sophisticated filtering algorithms that rely on both (1) explicit tags (e.g., \"supported devices\", if any), and (2) deeper analysis like XR-related library detection on the binary files (detailed below). Following this strategy, we filter XR applications from Microsoft Store (with \u201csupported devices\" as Apple Vision Pro) and Steam (with \"supported devices\" as \"VR Support\" or \"VR Only\")."}, {"title": "Complexity of XR Application Identification on Mobile Phone Marketplaces", "content": "The detection of XR applications on mobile phone platforms, i.e., Google Play and iOS App Store, posed additional challenges due to the lack of explicit categorization or tagging for VR/AR applications. Unlike XR-specific platforms, where applications are clearly marked for XR usage, mobile stores often classify XR applications within general-purpose categories, such as \u201cUtilities\u201d or \u201cGames\u201d, without any distinct indication of their XR capabilities. For Android applications, we utilized a widely-used library detection tool (LibScout [18]) to identify those leveraging any Android VR SDKs, However, this approach is not directly applicable to iOS, which is hard to perform library identification. For iOS, we employ a heuristic approach based on matching app titles and developer information from the identified Android applications."}, {"title": "Insufficient API Support and Access Restrictions", "content": "Only a few marketplaces provide API support. For most of the app stores, we need to implement our own crawlers to dynamically access, crawl, parse and download to obtain the data. Another challenge is the access rate limits imposed by various app stores. These limitations are intended to prevent server overload but complicate the crawling process. For example, Google Play and Steam impose strict access rate controls. To circumvent these restrictions, we implement a distributed crawling system using multiple authenticated agents to parallelize crawling. This challenge is mitigated by employing strategies such as spreading requests over extended periods."}, {"title": "Data Aggregation Across Platforms", "content": "Metadata consistency across platforms is another challenge that arises when aggregating data from multiple sources. While most app stores provide diversified metadata such as application name, developer, and description, there is often variability in the level of detail, the types and labels of attributes. Moreover, the metadata of applications that appear on multiple platforms can be inconsistent. Additional effort is required to duplicate, synthesize and normalize all data across platforms."}, {"title": "III. XRZoo", "content": "Table II summarizes the overall statistics of XRZOO. In total, XRZOO consists of 12,528 XR applications from nine"}, {"title": "IV.

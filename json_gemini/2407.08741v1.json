Consequently, smart lighting design is a rapidly growing research area. We describe a digital twin-based approach to smart lighting design that uses an immersive virtual reality digital twin equivalent (virtual environment) of the real-world, physical architectural space to explore the visual impact of light configurations. The CLIP neural network is used to obtain a similarity measure between a photo of the physical space with the corresponding rendering in the virtual environment. A case study was used to evaluate the proposed design process. The obtained similarity value of over 87% demonstrates the utility of the proposed approach.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "As smart lighting technology progresses, the ability to simulate and visualize its potential impact within environments prior to construction is increasingly important. The primary goal of our research is establishing an immersive virtual reality (VR) system to simulate a given physical environment, empowering near-identical smart lighting design within a digital twin (Mohammadrezaeia and Gra\u010danin 2022). The system supports real-time changes to lighting fixture settings such as brightness, color, and temporality, such that users are able to interact with the lighting system in the digital twin and witness the impact of those changes to lighting settings immediately. We describe a systematic approach that users can follow to create their own digital twin of a real-world, physical environment (Figure 1). (Figure 1). The users are guided on how to use hardware devices to capture details of the real-world environment for which they would like to produce a digital twin. These details include lighting values of bulbs, furnishing, and dimensional measurements of the environment and its contents. We use real-time lighting to show the impact of changes to brightness,"}, {"title": "2 RESULTS", "content": "To validate our digital twin's similarity to our photo capturing the real-world office, we generated three renderings: one with missing furniture and incorrect lighting color via the emission temperature setting, one with no local volumes to reflect, refract, blend light and create shadows, and the final one with optimal volume, furniture, and lighting values. As we enhanced the scene to get the digital twin's lighting to match the lighting of the real environment, the returned similarity value increased (Table 1)."}, {"title": "3 CONCLUSION", "content": "We described a digital twin-based approach to smart lighting design that provides designers with a way to evaluate the visual impact of light sources and fixture configurations in architectural settings. Users can use head-mounted displays to fully immerse themselves in a virtual environment, explore different light designs and accurately evaluate the visual outcomes. We believe our case provides a novel contribution to this rapidly growing research area."}]}

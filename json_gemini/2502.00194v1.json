Spencer Jr."], "abstract": "Railroad bridges are a crucial component of the U.S. freight rail system, which moves over 40 percent of the nation's freight and plays a critical role in the economy. However, aging bridge infrastructure and increasing train traffic pose significant safety hazards and risk service disruptions. The U.S. rail network includes over 100,000 railroad bridges, averaging one every 1.4 miles of track, with steel bridges comprising over 50% of the network's total bridge length. Early identification and assessment of damage in these bridges remain challenging tasks. This study proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach for damage identification in steel truss railroad bridges. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning approach, eliminating the need for large datasets typically required by supervised methods. The approach utilizes train wheel load data and bridge response during train crossing events as inputs for damage identification. The PINN model explicitly incorporates the governing differential equations of the linear time-varying (LTV) bridge-train system. Herein, this model employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture incorporating a custom Runge-Kutta (RK) integrator cell, designed for gradient-based learning. The proposed approach updates the bridge finite element model while also quantifying damage severity and localizing the affected structural members. A case study on the Calumet Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, with simulated damage scenarios, is used to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying damage while maintaining low false- positive rates. Furthermore, the damage identification pipeline is designed to seamlessly integrate prior knowledge from inspections and drone surveys, also enabling context-aware updating and assessment of bridge's condition.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Railroad bridges play a crucial role in the U.S. freight transportation network, and ensuring the structural integrity of these bridges is paramount for maintaining safe and efficient rail operations. The growing demands of rail transport, characterized by increased axle loads that often exceed the original design specifications for these bridges, have intensified the stress and fatigue on bridge structures, leading to accelerated deterioration. The composition of the U.S. railroad bridge inventory further underscores the critical importance of assessing the current state of bridges and developing effective damage identification strategies. The freight rail network is comprised of over 100,000 railroad bridges, more than half of which were constructed nearly a century ago \u00b9; more than 50% of the inventory, based on total bridge length in miles, consists of steel bridges \u00b2. Railroad bridge maintenance decisions are guided by insights gathered from bridge inspections, which include observations of bridge performance under revenue-service traffic conditions. Management of these aging structures presents unique challenges due to their susceptibility to fatigue, corrosion, and other time-dependent degradation mechanisms. A comprehensive Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) report \u00b3 reveals that approximately 17% of reported railroad bridge failures from 1999 to 2010 were attributed to failed structural members. This alarming statistic not only highlights the inadequacies in current inspection approaches but also emphasizes the potential catastrophic consequences of undetected structural issues. Moreover, the economic ramifications of these failures are substantial, with an estimated average loss of $1.5 million per incident \u00b3.\nRoutine condition assessments are therefore critical to identify deficient structures and prevent catastrophic failures. While visual inspection remains the most commonly used method for assessing railroad bridges, this approach has several inherent limitations \u2074,\u2075. Inspections are typically performed intermittently, increasing the risk of missing critical structural issues that can develop between intervals, especially in hard-to-reach areas of the bridge. These assessments are also highly subjective, relying on the inspector's experience and judgment, and are prone to human error. They are also time-consuming and costly, making frequent assessments impractical, which can result in subtle defects or deterioration being overlooked until they pose a risk to safety and performance. To address these issues, several researchers have investigated the use of structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies for railroad bridges. Critical railroad bridges of interest can be monitored using sensors to collect long-term and in-service data for the bridge. The sensors used in traditional methods typically consist of accelerometers, strain-gauges, and linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) \u2075. Ahmadi and Daneshjoo \u2076 implemented a monitoring system using accelerometers on a railroad bridge with known input train loads to assess key structural parameters. Banerji and Chikermane \u2077 collected strain and deflection measurements for in-service train loads on a masonry arch railroad bridge for model updating using a multi-response multi- parameter model updating approach. The emergence of deployable and low-cost wireless smart sensors (WSSs) for SHM, such as the Xnode \u2078 and Xnode-WSVS \u2079, has enabled multimodal and vision-based data acquisition in a scalable manner. Kim et al. \u00b9\u2070 and Moreu et al. \u00b9\u00b9 used wireless strain gages mounted on the rail to estimate real-time train inputs loads and measured the associated responses with wireless accelerometers and magnetic strain gages installed on the railroad bridge. Hoang et al. \u00b9\u00b2 instrumented nine timber trestle railroad bridges using WSSs integrated with 4G-LTE support for remote data retrieval offering an autonomous end-to-end monitoring pipeline for railroad bridges. Yoon et al. developed an approach to measure deflection of in-service railroad bridges using a drone \u00b9\u00b3. Furthermore, drone-based visual surveys have been investigated by researchers to also identify potential damage hot spots in railroad bridges, providing valuable information to complement sensor-based monitoring \u00b9\u2074,\u00b9\u2075. However, transitioning from data acquisition to effective condition assessment on railroad bridges remains a significant challenge.\nResearchers have investigated various data-driven approaches for assessing railroad bridges. For example, Marasco et al. \u00b9\u2076 applied sensor clustering and ARX modeling for damage localization and estimation using simulated acceleration data. Anastasia et al. \u00b9\u2077 proposed an auto-regressive time-series model to extract damage-sensitive features from strain data on railroad bridges and performed damage identification through clustering. Other studies have employed optimization"}, {"title": "2. BACKGROUND", "content": "To provide context to the research reported herein, this section briefly describes the two main approaches that have gained prominence in the application of PINNs for structural dynamics problems.\nThe first approach uses deep neural networks to approximate solutions for differential equations, with the optimization process guided by a loss function that adjusts the hyperparameters to satisfy initial and boundary conditions, as well as the governing equations, through collocation points \u00b2\u2079,\u00b3\u00b2. PINNs have been applied to different problems in structural dynamics, such as input identification \u00b3\u00b3, vibration analysis \u00b3\u2074, and system identification \u00b3\u2075. For example, Zhang et al. \u00b3\u2076 used a physics-informed variational autoencoder architecture to identify the structural excitation in a system using responses measured from ambient vibration. In this study, the authors validate the approach using only an LTI structural system, specifically a building frame model.

Each of these steps are described in the remainder of this section."}, {"title": "3.1. PINN-based architecture forward pass", "content": "The proposed PINN-based architecture to perform damage identification for LTV structural systems is described in this subsection. The proposed architecture explicitly embeds a reduced- order physics model into the deep learning pipeline, enabling the integration of domain knowledge and data-driven learning. At the core of the proposed PINN-based architecture is a recurrent neural network (RNN) cell \u2074\u00b2 that is designed to perform numerical integration. Building upon the model proposed by Nascimento et al. \u00b3\u2078 for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a PINN-based architecture is designed to solve the governing ODE of a linear time-varying (LTV) railroad bridge-train system subjected to moving train masses. In a conventional RNN cell (see (a)), for every timestep t, the next state (y\u209c) is predicted based on the current input (x\u209c) and the state in previous timestep (y\u209c\u208b\u2081) by applying a transformation f(.) as described by the equation\ny\u209c = f(y\u209c\u208b\u2081, x\u209c). The RNN cell proposed here, referred to as Phy-RNN (see Figure 3.2(b)), performs numerical integration for a railroad bridge-train system using data from train crossing events. Within the Phy-RNN cell, an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK-4) based integrator is designed in Python to solve the ODE governing the bridge-train dynamics. Critical to this approach is the ability to deal with time-varying systems such as is seen during train crossings for a railroad bridge-train system. The design of the RK-4 integrator using the PyTorch library \u2074\u00b3 take into account two important considerations: (a) the computations approach linear algebra time complexity \u2074\u2074, which help maintain reasonable training times, and (b) the gradients with respect to the trainable unknown parameters exist to facilitate backpropagation-based optimization. While the implemented RK-4 integrator herein is computationally efficient per timestep, this solver is conditionally stable and necessitates very small timesteps to maintain stability. Therefore, for handling more complex bridge systems with higher frequency content, an implicit RK integrator is also designed herein to accommodate larger timesteps. The design of the implicit RK integrator to solve the LTV bridge-train system is discussed in Section 4.5."}, {"title": "3.2. Damage simulation and unsupervised learning scheme", "content": "This section first describes how damage for the bridge-train system is modeled; subsequently, the associated model update step and the unsupervised learning scheme is detailed, as illustrated in the red bounding region of Figure 3.1. Data from various bridge damage scenarios is typically required to train a supervised deep-learning model; however, obtaining sufficient training data from a damaged structure, such as a railroad bridge with known damage levels, is often challenging and impractical in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, this research relies on simulating different damage scenarios on the finite element (FE) model of a railroad bridge, and employs an unsupervised learning scheme. This study focuses on identifying damage in structural members of truss railroad bridges, typically modeled as a reduction in member stiffness \u00b9\u2077, which can be due to section loss, excessive corrosion, fatigue and buckling. To simulate various damage scenarios, different damage levels are introduced to selected structural members of the truss railroad bridge by assigning deviation ratios in the range 0 to 1.0, where 1.0 represents an undamaged state and 0 indicates complete stiffness loss. Notably, deviation ratios greater than 1.0 are also considered to simulate members with higher-than-assumed stiffness; evaluating the proposed approach's ability to detect underestimated stiffness in structural members. This study assumes that the input train loading time history is available for train crossing events; that can be measured on-site using strain gauges mounted on the railroad track \u00b9\u00b9. To serve as a substitute for measured responses on a bridge with a known damaged state, train-wheel configurations at velocities of interest are simulated on the FE model to generate ground-truth output responses. Several cases with random deviation ratios assigned to structural members at different locations of a railroad bridge are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed PINN-based strategy."}, {"title": "4. RAILROAD BRIDGE SYSTEM MODELING", "content": "The physics-based modeling used to capture the dynamics of the truss railroad bridge considering the bridge-train interaction problem is the focus of this section. The railroad bridge selected to validate this damage identification study is an open-deck steel truss bridge spanning the Calumet River near Chicago, Illinois (see Figure 4.1, highlighted in red with \u2018CN Bridge'). Opened for service in 1971, the Calumet bridge is approximately 95 meters long, 21 meters tall, and 10 meters wide, with a truss structure comprised of a series of interconnected steel members. First, the development of the FE model for the Calumet bridge is described, along with the formulation of the governing equations of motion for the linear time-varying nature of the system. Although the Calumet bridge has two tracks, a simplified 2D model of the bridge is developed for the initial study which neglects the asymmetric loading of the bridge. Subsequently, a 3D model of the Calumet bridge is developed that accommodates the two tracks on the bridge. Further, to increase computational efficiency, a reduced-order 3D model is developed. For performing damage identification on the 3D model efficiently an implicit RK integrator is designed that handles the LTV bridge-train system.

The cross-bracing at the top of the bridge has a relatively small cross-sectional area compared to the other structural members and has less influence on the global response of the bridge due to vertical train loads.

As a rule of thumb, the timestep is selected as dt\u2264Tmin/10, where Tmin =1/fmax, and fmax is the highest significant natural frequency of the system.

Such prior knowledge for railroad bridge assessment can be derived from multimodal sources, including visual inspections conducted by bridge engineers, drone surveys providing visual indicators of damage on structural members, and sensitivity analysis of members using finite element (FE) models. In this study, the learning scheme incorporates prior knowledge in two ways: (i) modifying the initial deviation ratio: instead of initializing the optimizer with k\u1d62\u1d48 = 1.0 (healthy state) for all structural members, the initial value of k\u1d62\u1d48 is modified for members that are likely damaged based on prior information. Herein, a heuristic approach of weighted combination \u2075\u00b2 is used to account for both the prior estimated damage and the confidence level associated with that estimate. The initial deviation ratio is computed as:\nk\u1d62\u1d48initial = (1 - p) \u00d7 k healthy + p \u00d7 kprior (6)\nwhere, k\u1d62\u1d48initial is the initial deviation ratio for ith member, p is the confidence level (in the range 0- 1.0) associated with the prior estimate, khealthy represents the healthy (undamaged) state, and kprior is the prior estimate of the deviation ratio.

For the Phy-RNN cell, each epoch corresponds to a full pass of the simulated time- history response during a train crossing event. A batch-wise training approach is employed to update the model's learnable parameters in batches, thereby reducing computational costs. Based on trial-and-error, a batch size of 4 to 8 was found to perform well. In the batch-wise approach, the first batch assumes an initial state of zero (before the train enters the bridge). For subsequent batches, the initial state is updated using the predicted state from the last timestep of the preceding batch. To enhance the robustness of the unsupervised learning approach, particularly in the absence of explicit labels for damaged members, a physical constraint is introduced during parameter updating. This constraint ensures that the minimum value of the deviation ratio remains at 0.01, preventing structural instability. During each epoch, the PINN based model processes the input load time history in batches and predicts the corresponding state. Notably, damage identification is performed using data from a single train-crossing event. The predicted response is compared with the simulated ground-truth response for the damage case to compute the loss, which guides the optimizer in updating the model parameters.\nThe choice of loss function and optimizer plays a crucial role in the training process and can significantly impact the model's performance. The Phy-RNN model outputs the structural response for a batch of input load time history, given as a state vector with displacement and velocity response of the free DOFs. For the case when acceleration responses are also used for damage identification, the acceleration vector is estimated with the finite difference method by approximating it as the first-order derivative of the velocity vector.

Railroad truss bridges often function as space-frame structures, with members primarily carrying axial forces \u2074\u2076. Herein, FE analysis of the Calumet 2D bridge model revealed that the forces in the vertical members can be considered to be zero, in comparison to other structural members. As a result, damage induced on these vertical members is not observable in the measured responses. This prior knowledge can be integrated into the updating pipeline using gradient scaling, as detailed in Section 4.5.\nAdditionally, sparsity is incorporated into the damage identification approach through L1 regularization, based on the assumption that not all members are likely to be damaged.

Results on 3D Calumet bridge model", "content": "This section validates the performance of the PINN-based model on the 3D Calumet bridge model. Herein, the damage identification study utilizes the Guyan reduced model of the 3D Calumet bridge and the implicit RK formulation within the Phy-RNN cell, as described in Sections 4.4 - 4.5. Damage in railroad truss bridges often occurs in clusters, particularly in regions experiencing high stress concentrations, fatigue damage, and larger transverse displacements, such as the central region of the bridge. The AREMA's Bridge Inspection Handbook \u2075\u2077 highlights that bridge inspectors prioritize these regions during inspections. Two damage clusters are considered in this study: (a) Cluster A \u2013 central region: due to larger vibrations near the central region, damage often propagates from the cross-bracing at rail level, which have smaller cross-sections, towards the connecting main structural members. Herein, this cluster includes four damaged members: a cross- bracing, a vertical structural member, and two other diagonal structural members, as shown in Figure 5.5(a). (b) Cluster B \u2013 approach region: structural members near the approach of railroad bridges are prone to clustered damage due to external factors, including oil spills, uneven track- to-bridge transitions, and sudden train wheel impacts \u2075\u2078. The damage case considered for the approach cluster here for the 3D bridge model is depicted in Figure 5.5(b).\nThe PINN based model herein was initialized with the RMSprop optimizer and a CyclicLR scheduler, cycling learning rates between 5e-4 to le-3 over a step size of 50 epochs; a batch size of 64 was selected. A timestep of 0.002 secs was used for the implicit RK integrator within the Phy-RNN cell. The model uses the displacement responses at the selected master DOFs of the Guyan reduced model (Section 4.4) of the 3D Calumet bridge. Preliminary trials revealed that vertical members, cross-bracing, and lateral bracing exhibited low sensitivity to updates and were frequently identified as false positives. This behavior aligns with the cues from the FE model, where some of the vertical members act similar to zero-force members in a truss. Furthermore, bracing, due to their significantly smaller cross-sectional areas, shows reduced sensitivity to structural response due to damage in the members. Damage identification for less sensitive members poses a challenge. To address this, prior knowledge of the bridge model is incorporated into the PINN based pipeline using a gradient scaling factor of 1e3 for the less sensitive structural members. This study simulates a freight train crossing the bridge at 80 MPH, resulting in a displacement response time history duration of 28.87 seconds. The global stiffness matrix of the Guyan reduced model of the 3D Calumet bridge model has a size of 136x136, and the displacement response matrix for the observed DOFs has a size 14400 x 126, visualized in Figure 5.6(a)."}, {"title": "6. DISCUSSION", "content": "While the proposed PINN based model shows promising results, there are several challenges that remain open for future research. In this study, the false positives are identified based on a deterministic error threshold of 5% from the healthy state. Probabilistic damage identification with a confidence score associated with damage parameters would be explored in a future study. Herein, damage identification for the 3D Calumet bridge model is performed with the Guyan reduced model. The selection of DOFs influences damage identification results, ideally, the DOFs to be selected for measuring responses need to be optimized such the number of sensors or DOFs monitored on the bridge can be minimized for cost-savings and efficiency, while capturing the overall behavior of bridge for effective damage detection. This study focuses on the feasibility of unsupervised PINNs for simultaneous damage identification and model updating in LTV railroad bridge systems, rather than benchmarking against existing methods. A main computational bottleneck for the PINN based model lies in the RK integrator. Currently, work is ongoing to use semi-supervised PINN architecture to substitute for the differentiable RK integrator to make the deep learning pipeline more efficient. Additionally, this paper focuses on modeling damage in structural members as a reduction in stiffness. However, other types of damage, such as support settlement and damage to connections or joints, are also critical for effective railroad bridge management and will be addressed in future studies. This study uses simulated scenarios of damage on a full-scale railroad truss bridge for validation of the PINN based damage identification approach. Future research will address validation through experimental tests on an instrumented test structure. Finally, ongoing work on automated, vision-based damage localization and severity prediction from drone surveys on steel truss bridges will be integrated into the proposed PINN based damage identification and model updating pipeline.\nMoving forward towards the goal of creating robust digital twins for monitoring critical bridge assets, the approach proposed in this study offers a promising pathway. By utilizing data from sensors deployed on a railroad bridge for long-term monitoring, the method allows the bridge model to remain updated based on observed data. Notably, the proposed PINN based model requires response measurements from only a single train crossing event to update the bridge model and perform damage identification. This capability potentially makes the approach suitable for campaign-style monitoring deployments, enabling efficient railroad bridge assessment during routine inspections by bridge inspectors."}, {"title": "7. CONCLUSION", "content": "A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach was developed for damage identification in railroad truss bridges. The approach incorporated the governing differential equations of the linear time-varying bridge-train system dynamics directly into a deep learning model, using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture with a custom Runge-Kutta (RK) integrator cell. An unsupervised learning approach utilized train wheel load data and bridge responses from train crossings to update the bridge finite element model effectively. This method also quantified damage severity and localized affected structural members without requiring extensive labeled datasets.\nCase studies on the simulated railroad truss Calumet Bridge in Chicago, IL demonstrated the robustness of the proposed strategy in identifying damage, with low false-positive rates even with noisy data. For the simplified 2D Calumet bridge model, the approach achieved an average accuracy exceeding 98% across multiple damage scenarios, with randomly selected structural members and varying damage levels. Further validation on the 3D Calumet bridge model was conducted with a Guyan reduced formulation to manage large degrees of freedom efficiently, achieving over 98% accuracy in damage identification and less than 2% false positives across scenarios, including damage clusters representative of real-world conditions. This performance underscored the approach's potential for accurate, context-aware model updating, particularly when supplemented with available site inspection and prior information from FE models. The results highlight the potential of the"}]}

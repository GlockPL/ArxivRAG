However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-01-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available at this link.", "sections": [{"title": "1.

The growing interest in LLM evaluation has led to the creation of benchmarks across various domains, such as mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2025), visual reasoning (Chen et al., 2021; Cao & Xiao, 2022; He et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024b; Lu et al., 2023), embodied AI (physical reasoning) (Bisk et al., 2019; Bakhtin et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023b), dynamic"}, {"title": "3. The UGPhysics Benchmark", "content": "3.1. UGPhysics Overview\nWe introduce UGPhysics, a large and comprehensive undergraduate-level physics benchmark specifically designed to thoroughly evaluate the physics problem-solving ability of LLMs. UGPhysics is large in size, including 5,520 physics problems presented bilingually for better evaluation. It covers three domains: Mechanics & Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism, and, Modern Physics, encompassing 13 core subjects and 59 different topics in undergraduate-level physics (details are in Appendix A.4). Similar to He et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024b); Xu et al. (2025), each problem is structured with 7 answer types to facilitate answer judgment, including six atomic answer types and one compound type that is a list of atomic ones. To provide a more granular analysis of LLMs' physics reasoning ability, we categorize each test example into four distinct physics reasoning capabilities, which could possibly show which skill sets certain families of models succeed or fail on. Detailed statistics of UGPhysics are shown in Table 2. Additionally, data leakage detection on several LLMs is conducted to identify potential data contamination (see Section 5.4)."}, {"title": "3.2. UGPhysics Creation", "content": "Our UGPhysics creation process can mainly be divided into three distinct phases: data collection & cleaning, data processing & filtering, and problem annotation.\nData Collection & Cleaning. The UGPhysics is sourced from several undergraduate-level physics exercise books. The corresponding PDF files are converted to LaTeX format using the Mathpix tool for optical character recognition. Both the original PDFs and the converted LaTeX files are manually reviewed and corrected by our team. The LaTeX files are then structured into a \"Problem-Solution-Answer\" format using various markups. Deduplication is carried out based on model embeddings to eliminate potential repeated or similar problems. Currently, problems containing images are excluded to focus on text-only reasoning of UGPhysics.\nProblem Processing & Filtering. In physics, some problems are progressive, where subsequent questions may depend on the answers or information from previous ones. Unlike He et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024b), we split these progressive problems into independent new problems, incorporating all relevant information in each new problem. Additionally, we exclude problems that lack definitive answers for assessing correctness, such as estimation, proof, and explanation problems. Several examples are provided in Appendix A.1. All problems are initially in Chinese and then translated into English to facilitate bilingual evaluation.\nProblem Annotation. He et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024b); Xu et al. (2025) suggest that classifying answer types can facilitate the evaluation pipeline. In our UGPhysics, we categorize answers into seven types: six atomic answer types and one compound type, which consists of a list of atomic answers separated by commas. One concrete example for each atomic answer type is presented in Table 3. To emphasize the focus on physics reasoning, we label each test example with one of four distinct physics reasoning skills: Knowledge Recall, Laws Application, Math Derivation, and Practical Application (\u201cOthers\u201d for the remaining). We use GPT-40 as the annotator for the categorization of skill sets. Further details are provided in Appendix A.3."}, {"title": "3.3.

Additionally, unit conversions"}, {"title": "4. Experiments", "content": "4.1. Experimental Setup\nEvaluated LLMs. Our evaluation covers 31 leading LLMS, including closed-source commercial LLMs, open-source general-purpose LLMs, 01-like LLMs, and specialized math LLMs. Based on our UGPhysics, we provide a thorough evaluation of the physics reasoning capabilities of current LLMs. The evaluated LLMs are listed below:\nFor proprietary LLMs, we select OpenAI-01-mini (OpenAI, 2024b), GPT40 (OpenAI, 2024a), and GPT40-mini (OpenAI, 2024a).\nFor open-source general-purpose LLMs, we evaluated the LLaMA-3.1-Instruct series (8B, 70B) (Dubey et al., 2024), LLaMA-3.3-Instruct-70B, Qwen2.5-Instruct (7B, 72B)(Yang et al., 2024a), Yi-1.5-Chat (6B, 9B, 34B) (01-AI et al., 2024), Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 (MistralAI, 2024), Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 (Mistral, 2024b), Mistral-Small-Instruct-2409 (Mistral, 2024c), Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 (Mistral, 2024a), DeepSeek-MOE-16B-Chat (Dai et al., 2024), and DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat (DeepSeek-AI, 2024).\nWe also incorporate specialized math LLMs to assess the extent to which continued training and SFT on math-related content can enhance physics reasoning: DeepSeekMath-7B (-RL, -Instruct) (Shao et al., 2024), Qwen2.5-Math (7B, 72B)(Yang et al., 2024b), Mathstral-7B (Mistral, 2023), NuminaMath-7B-CoT (Beeching et al., 2024), and OpenMath2-Llama-3.1 (8B, 70B) (Toshniwal et al., 2024).\nFor o1-like LLMs, we cover QwQ-32B-Preview (QwQ-Team, 2024), Skywork-01-Open-Llama-3.1-8B (Skywork, 2024), and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) distilled series (DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Llama-8B, -Llama-70B; -Qwen-7B, -Qwen-32B).\nWe provide the details of these LLMs in Appendix B.1.\nEvaluation Setting. Following He et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024b), all our experiments use zero-shot prompts, tailored to different answer types for better answer extraction and rule-based matching. Detailed prompts are given in Appendix B.2. We use vLLM\u00b9 to speed up the evaluation process. To maintain consistency in evaluations and facilitate reproduction, we set the maximum output length to 4,096 tokens and employ a greedy decoding strategy with the temperature 0. For LLMs with a maximum output length of less than 4,096 tokens during SFT, such as NuminaMath-CoT-7B, we adjust the maximum output length to align with their specific SFT configurations. More Details of the evaluation setting are given in Appendix B.3."}, {"title": "5. Analysis", "content": "5.1. Fine-grained Analysis\nIn this section, we conduct an in-depth analysis using 8 strong LLMs and delay the complete results to Appendix C.\nLLMs show varying performance across different subjects, although the disparity is relatively small. As shown in Figure 2a, the average overall accuracy of eight strong LLMs reveals that they perform particularly well in Semiconductor Physics (27.0%) and Atomic Physics (22.9%). In contrast, their performance is slightly lower in Theoretical Mechanics (13.8%). Additionally, LLMs show minor performance variation across six out of 13 subjects, with accuracies hovering around 19%. In comparison, LLMs' performance can vary from 10% to 70% across different math topics (Liu et al., 2024).\nLLMs exhibit varying levels of physics reasoning skills. As shown in Figure 2b, the selected 8 LLMs display similar performance trends across different physics reasoning skills. They perform well on Knowledge Recall tasks but struggle with Math Derivation problems. This suggests that recalling physics concepts is relatively simple for LLMs, whereas performing complex math derivations in a physics context (usually require physics knowledge and practical meanings) is more challenging. Notably, OpenAI-01-mini outperforms the other models across all four distinct physics reasoning skills (as well as \"Others\").\nLLMs exhibit varying performance across different languages when solving physics problems. From Table 5, some LLMs demonstrate only minor discrepancies in performance between English (EN) and Chinese (ZH), such as OpenAI-01-mini, Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, and QwQ-32B. However, other LLMs exhibit a significant performance gap between ZH and EN, such as Yi-1.5-Chat and LLaMA-3.1. For further illustration, Figure 3 presents the performance of a subset of LLMs in both languages, with the models sorted by the difference in accuracy between EN and ZH. It is evident that LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Llama-70B show a substantial discrepancy between ZH and EN, while Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct and QwQ-32B-Preview exhibit negligible differences. This discrepancy is reasonable, as LLaMA models have limited Chinese corpus for pretraining and fine-tuning (Dubey et al., 2024), whereas Qwen LLMs are trained on a much larger Chinese corpus (Yang et al., 2024a;b)."}, {"title": "5.2. Reliability of Evaluation", "content": "Despite several studies utilizing LLMs to evaluate correctness across all test examples (Gao et al., 2024) or specific subsets (Zhang et al., 2023), the capability of our MARJ to reliably evaluate physics problems remains inconclusive. To substantiate our MARJ evaluation method, we conduct a human evaluation to determine its alignment with human judgment on a randomly selected subset of 100 test examples. Specifically, we initially annotate whether each solution adheres to the ground-truth answer for its corresponding problem, establishing these annotations as the gold standard. Subsequently, we compare the evaluations generated by our rule-model combination with the gold standard. We find that our MARJ evaluation achieves an accuracy of 98% when compared to human annotations, underscoring the reliability of our evaluation methods and outcomes. Furthermore, our evaluation approach is efficient in assessing correctness for examples whose answers can be easily verified by Sympy, while also demonstrating resilience in handling complex answers that are not suitable for rule-based judgments."}, {"title": "5.3. Error Analysis", "content": "To gain deeper insights into the performance of LLMs, we select 100 incorrect answers generated by OpenAI-01-mini and have these errors annotated by human evaluators to determine failure reasons. As illustrated in Figure 4, the primary error types are flawed reasoning, knowledge deficiency, and incorrect application, which contrast with those in mathematics, where calculation is one of the major sources of errors (Chen et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2025). This suggests that reasoning and math derivation in physics, which require additional knowledge and involve real-world meanings, are more challenging than the abstract reasoning in mathematics. Several cases are provided in Appendix D."}, {"title": "5.4. About Data Leakage", "content": "We perform data leakage detection to alleviate the potential data contamination in UGPhysics. Following Xu et al. (2024a), we utilize n-gram accuracy to detect any data leakage within different LLMs. Concretely, we combined each problem with its solution in the dataset and randomly chose K positions for extracting 5-grams. A sample is considered contaminated if the 5-grams predicted by the model match the actual 5-grams from the dataset. The results for a subset of LLMs are presented in Table 6. It is evident that most models exhibit some degree of data leakage. Among them, Qwen2.5-MATH-72B-instruct shows the highest level of leakage, accurately predicting 5 grams in 78 samples. Additionally, we report on the contaminated samples that are subsequently answered correctly by the tested models. The numbers of both \"Contaminated\" and \"Contaminated & Correct\" samples are extremely low, suggesting that data leakage has minimal impact on UGPhysics."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we propose UGPhysics, a comprehensive undergraduate-level physics benchmark, and the MARJ answer scoring framework to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in solving physics problems.

Physics Reasoning Skills Annotation", "content": "The definitions of different physics skills are as follows:\n\u2022 Knowledge Recall: Refers to the recall and understanding of basic physics concepts, formulas, and definitions.

Students are expected to correctly describe the content, conditions, and scope of these laws and determine their applicability to specific scenarios. Examples include Newton's laws, the laws of thermodynamics, and Coulomb's law.\n\u2022 Math Derivation: Focuses on the mathematical derivation and logical proof of physics formulas or principles. This requires students to use known laws or principles and apply rigorous mathematical reasoning to derive new relationships or theorems. Examples include deriving the momentum conservation equation from Newton's second law or deriving thermodynamic relations from the ideal gas law.\n\u2022 Practical Application: Emphasizes the practical use of physics knowledge, laws, and derivations to solve real-world problems. This includes analyzing scenarios, building physical models, and using calculations and logical reasoning to arrive at solutions. Examples include calculating the final velocity of a car using the work-energy theorem or analyzing the motion of a charged particle using electric field equations.\nThe prompt used for classification is given in Table 9.

Since $m_{h} < m_{e}$, it follows that:\n$m$ = $\\frac{m_{e} m_{h}}{m_{e}+m_{h}}$ $\\approx$ $m_{h}$\nFor the ground state, n = 1, and $E_{1}$ = $E_{c}$ = 1.386 eV, thus:\n$m_{h}$ = $\\frac{8 \\epsilon^{2} \\epsilon_{n} h^{2}(E_{g} - E_{c})}{e^{4}}$\n= $\\frac{8 \\times 9.6^{2} \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12})^{2} \\times (6.626 \\times 10^{-34})^{2} \\times 0.014 \\times 1.6 \\times 10^{-19}}{(1.6 \\times 10^{-19})^{4}}$\n= 8.67 $\\times$ $10^{-36}$ kg = $\\frac{8.67 \\times 10^{-36}}{9.1 \\times 10^{-31}}$ = 9.52 $\\times$ $10^{-2} m_{0}$\nGround-Truth Answer: 9.52 x 10^-2\nModel Output: 0.07"}]}

However, existing works tackling this scenario heavily rely on extensive human annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel task named Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE) that considers an unsupervised setting without any human knowledge of the concepts. Given an image that contains multiple concepts, the task aims to extract and recreate individual concepts solely relying on the existing knowledge from pretrained diffusion models. To achieve this, we present ConceptExpress that tackles UCE by unleashing the inherent capabilities of pretrained diffusion models in two aspects. Specifically, a concept localization approach automatically locates and disentangles salient concepts by leveraging spatial correspondence from diffusion self-attention; and based on the lookup association between a concept and a conceptual token, a concept-wise optimization process learns discriminative tokens that represent each individual concept. Finally, we establish an evaluation protocol tailored for the UCE task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Concept Express is a promising solution to the UCE task.

Although diffusion models"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Text-to-image synthesis In the realm of GANs [8,20,29\u201331], plenty of works have gained remarkable advancements in text-to-image generation [52, 64, 77,78, 80,86] and text-driven image manipulation [1, 18, 47, 75], significantly pushing forward image synthesis conditioned on plain text. Content-rich text-to-image generation is achieved by auto-regressive models [51,79] that are trained on large-scale text-image data. Based on the pretrained CLIP [49], Crowson et al. [14] optimizes the generated image at test time using CLIP similarity without any training. Diffusion-based methods [23] have pushed the boundaries of text-to-image generation to a new level, e.g., DALLE 2 [50], Imagen [57], GLIDE [45], and LDM [54]. Based on the implementation of LDMs [54], Stable Diffusion (SD), large-scale trained on LAION-5B [59], achieves unprecedented text-to-image synthesis performance. Diffusion models are widely used for various tasks such as controllable generation [82,85], global [9,67] and local editing [3, 5, 13, 32, 46, 70], video generation [24,61,74] and editing [43,83], inpainting [41], and scene generation [4,6].\nGenerative concept learning Recently, many works [12,16,17,21,25,36,38, 42, 48, 55, 60, 65, 73] have emerged, aiming to learn a generative concept from multiple images.

Identity similarity measures the similarity between each concept in the training image and the concept-specific generated images. We employ CLIP [49] and DINO [10] to compute the similarities. To ensure that the similarity is computed specifically for the i-th concept, we obtain concept-wise masks with SAM [33] by identifying the specific SAM mask associated with our extracted concept. Specifically, for each concept, we prompt SAM with 3 randomly sampled points on our extracted mask to produce SAM masks. The training image is then masked with the SAM mask corresponding to the i-th concept. The metric of identity similarity provides a crucial criterion for evaluating the intra-concept performance of unsupervised concept extraction. Compositional similarity measures the CLIP or DINO sim-ilarity between the source image and the generated image, conditioned on the prompt \"a photo of [V1] and [V2] ... [VN]\". This metric quantifies the degree to which the source image can be reversed using the extracted concepts.\nClassification accuracy To assess the extent of disentanglement achieved for each concept within the full set of extracted concepts, we establish a benchmark that evaluates concept classification accuracy. Specifically, we first employ a vision encoder, such as CLIP [49] or DINO [10], to extract feature representations for each concept from the SAM-masked training images. In total, we obtain 264 concepts in D\u2081 and 19 concepts in D2. We use these concept features as prototypes to construct a concept classifier. We then employ the same vision"}, {"title": "4.3 Performance", "content": "Quantitative comparison We compare ConceptExpress with BaS\u2020 based on concept similarity and classification accuracy metrics. The quantitative comparison results on the two datasets are reported in Tabs. la and 1b, respectively with CLIP [49] and DINO [10] as the visual encoder. Notably, ConceptExpress outperforms BaS\u2020 by a significant margin on all evaluation metrics. It achieves higher concept similarity SIM\u00b9 and SIMC, indicating a closer alignment with the source concepts. It also achieves higher classification accuracy ACC\u00b9 and ACC\u00b3, indicating a more significant level of disentanglement among the individually extracted concepts.

The split-and-merge strategy effectively improves identity similarity and classification accuracy while slightly sacrificing compositional sim-ilarity due to its strong focus on a single concept. In Fig. 6, we present the generated images at different training steps, which reveals how SnM rectifies the training direction. The results illustrate that SnM effectively expands the concept space, allowing learnable tokens to explore a wider range of concepts, ultimately resulting in a more faithful concept indicator.\nEffectiveness of regularization By comparing Rows (0) and (2) in Tab. 2, we observe that regularizing the attention map can enhance the generation per-formance of individual concepts.

To aggregate them into a single map for further processing, we follow the approach used in [66]. Each self-attention map \\(A_l[I, J, :, :]\\) represents the correlation between the location (I, J) and all spatial locations. As a result, the last two dimensions of the self-attention maps have spatial consistency, and we interpolate them to ensure uniformity. On the other hand, the first two dimen-sions of the self-attention maps indicate the locations to which attention maps refer. Therefore, we duplicate these dimensions. By interpolation and duplica-tion, we align the self-attention maps in all layers to a common latent resolution (i.e., 64\u00d764). Finally, we compute the average of all attention maps to obtain the aggregated map. This aggregation step allows us to create a unified attention map combining all maps from different layers.\nConceptual token learning We utilize the split-and-merge strategy in train-ing conceptual tokens. In the training after splitting, we not only sample prompts of individual tokens but also sample a compositional prompt \u201ca photo of [V1] and [V2] ... [VN]\u201d for training. This approach enhances the compositionality of the learnable tokens. However, unlike [2], we refrain from using all possible composi-tions and instead only use the full composition. This decision is made to ensure that the proportion of using single tokens remains high during training. This, in turn, facilitates effective learning of each individual conceptual token.\nEarth mover's distance (EMD) We penalize attention alignment using the location-aware EMD. The EMD is formulated as an optimal transportation prob-lem. Suppose we have supplies of \\(n_s\\) sources \\(S = {s_i}_{i=1}^{n_s}\\) and demands of \\(n_d\\) des-tinations \\(D = {d_j}_{j=1}^{n_d}\\). Given the moving cost from the i-th source to the j-th destination \\(c_{ij}\\), an optimal transportation problem aims to find the minimal-cost flow \\(f_{ij}\\) from sources to destinations:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{minimize} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n_s} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_d} c_{ij} f_{ij}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{subject to} \\quad f_{ij} \\geq 0, \\quad i = 1, ..., n_s, \\quad j = 1, ..., n_d\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n_d} f_{ij} = s_i, \\quad i = 1, ..., n_s\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n_s} f_{ij} = d_j, \\quad j = 1, ..., n_d\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the optimal flow \\(f_{ij}\\) is computed by the moving cost \\(c_{ij}\\), the supplies \\(s_i\\), and the demands \\(d_j\\). The EMD can be further formulated as \\((1 \u2013 c_{ij}) f_{ij}\\). In our problem, the cross-attention map \\(c_{[v]}\\) represents the supply, while the target mean attention \\(f_i\\) represents the demand. The moving cost is calculated as the Euclidean distance between spatial locations. Unlike the MSE, the EMD considers differences not only between elements at the same location but also between elements at different locations. This means that the EMD takes into account both spatial alignment and the magnitude of differences, providing a more comprehensive measure of dissimilarity."}, {"title": "B Concept Localization Benchmark", "content": "In the main paper, we present a novel benchmark to evaluate concept localization performance. This benchmark effectively assesses our model's concept localization capability in two aspects: (1) concept discovery accuracy and (2) concept segmentation efficacy. Here, we offer further details on the benchmark, including the dataset and evaluation metrics.\nDataset curation To assess concept localization, the benchmark dataset must meet two criteria: (1) clear and distinct concept definition, and (2) accurate ground-truth concept masks. Natural images lack these characteristics. Instead, we source our images from CLEVR [27], a dataset known for its well-defined objects, diverse in colors, materials, and shapes, set against a uniform grey back-ground. We collect a total of 25 images, each containing 3 to 5 concepts, along with their corresponding ground-truth segmentation masks. We show image sam-ples from the dataset alongside the generated images of our extracted concepts in Fig. 10 (left).\nEvaluation metrics We further introduce evaluation metrics tailored for con-cept localization. The process of concept localization incorporates two parts: (1) concept discovery and (2) concept segmentation. For these two parts, we devise three metrics: recall and precision to assess concept discovery, and av-erage intersection over union (IoU) to assess concept segmentation. Specifically, let \\(P = {m_i}_{i=1}^N\\) denote the set of the N concept segments discovered by the model, and let \\(Q = {\\mu_j}_{j=1}^M\\) denote the set of the M ground-truth concept seg-"}, {"title": "C User Study", "content": "To ensure the assessment of generation quality aligns with human preference, we conduct a user study comparing the generated results from BaSt and Concept-Express.

For each concept, we presented the users with 8 images, randomly generated by ConceptExpress and BaS\u2020 respectively, along with the masked image of the source concept. They were then asked to indicate which model produced images that better resembled the source concept. Finally, we collected a total of 266 user votes, representing human preference. Among all the votes, 18.8% of the votes favored BaSt while 81.2% preferred our model. Detailed statistics of the votes for each concept are present in Fig. 11. The user study further indicates that ConceptExpress out-performs BaSt in generating concept images that align with human judgment."}, {"title": "D Additional Ablation Studies", "content": "D.1 Self-attention Clustering\nIn Fig. 12, we present additional self-attention clustering results, comparing our approach with k-means and FINCH [58]. Upon observation, we note that k-means and FINCH may separate a single concept (as seen in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rows) or include background regions (as seen in the 4th row) within their clusters. In contrast, our approach consistently demonstrates high accuracy in locating each concept, ensuring precise concept localization within the image.\nD.2 Split-and-merge Strategy\nVisualization In Fig. 13, we provide two additional examples illustrating how the split-and-merge strategy rectifies the token learning process. The split-and-merge strategy expands the search space for concepts during the splitting phase, allowing the merged token to exhibit concept characteristics that closely align with the source concept. This improves the ability to learn and represent unseen concepts without initialization, ultimately enhancing image generation quality.\nEffect of contrastive loss We further investigate the impact of the con-trastive loss during the splitting phase. The contrastive loss encourages split tokens representing the same concept to be closer together, promoting better concept agreement across all tokens. In Fig. 14, we employ PCA to visualize the embedding vectors with and without the contrastive loss. When the contrastive loss is used, the embedding vectors representing the same concept exhibit a more compact distribution, aligning with our goal of enhancing concept representation. We also report the quantitative comparison in Tab. 4. The use of contrastive loss can enhance the performance on all metrics, especially on classification accuracy.\nEffect of token merging To validate the necessity of merging multiple tokens midway through optimization, we additionally evaluate a variant that optimizes the multiple randomly initialized tokens separately and merges them at the end. We compare the results in Tab. 5. Our method significantly outperforms the variant, especially in compositional similarity and classification accuracy."}, {"title": "E Additional Quantitative Analysis", "content": "E.1 Unsupervised vs. Supervised\nWe present quantitative results for unsupervised methods, namely ConceptExpress and BaSt, as well as methods augmented with different types of supervision.

The first limitation is its difficulty in distinguishing instances from the same semantic category. The second limitation is its struggle to accurately learn concepts for instances with a relatively small occurrence. We have discussed these limitations in Sec. 5 in the main paper.\nTo further illustrate these limitations, we provide examples of unsatisfactory cases in Fig. 18. The first case arises because similar patches of instances from the same category (such as bird wings) exhibit close distributions in self-attention maps, leading to early grouping in the pre-clustering phase. As a result, we localize the two birds as a single concept, which may affect the number of instances shown in the generated image. We considered including spatial bias to address this, but we found it might impede the normal grouping of complete concepts. Therefore, we opt for our current approach. It is important to note that this limitation does not significantly impact the overall generation quality. Our model preserves the integrity of complete concepts, ensuring they reflect bird characteristics rather than generating creatures with multiple heads. Despite the segmentation containing multiple instances, the model can still generate a single instance, as shown in row 1 column 3. The second case is caused by the limited occurrence of the target concept. Due to the low resolution (64\u00d764) of the latent space, the small region captures limited information, making it challenging to train an accurate concept representation. As a result, the small \"marble pedestal\" is learned through the diffusion process and is transformed into a representation resembling a \"marble church\". We believe that future research will aim to address these limitations."}, {"title": "I Broader Impact", "content": "This paper presents a convenient and efficient concept extraction method that does not require external manual intervention. The extracted concepts can be used to generate new images. On one hand, this greatly facilitates the effort-less disentanglement of instances from an image and enables the generation of personalized images. It even allows for the creation of a vast concept library by processing a large batch of images, which can be archived for the use of swift generation. On the other hand, however, this technology can also be meticulously exploited to handle and generate sensitive images, such as violent, pornographic, or privacy-compromising content. Moreover, due to its unsupervised nature, or-ganizations with massive image datasets can easily perform concept extraction and build extensive concept libraries, which may include a substantial amount of harmful or sensitive content. We believe it is crucial to continuously observe and regulate this technology to ensure its responsible use in the future.\nLimitation ConceptExpress has the following limitations that remain to be addressed in future research. The first limitation is related to processing im-ages containing multiple instances from the same semantic category, such as two instances of a bird. In this case, self-attention correspondence struggles to dis-entangle these instances and tends to identify them as a single concept, rather than recognizing them as separate instances. The second limitation is that cer-tain concepts with a relatively small occurrence in the image may be discovered. This can result in poor concept learning due to the lack of sufficient information for reconstructing the concept in the latent space with a resolution of 64\u00d764. The third limitation is that our model requires a certain level of input image quality. In the future, it can be further enhanced to robustly handle uncurated natural data, making it more applicable to real-world scenarios."}]}

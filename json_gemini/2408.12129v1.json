They achieve efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly grid operation by integrating advanced information communication technology, automation technology, and new energy technology[1, 2]. In a smart grid, the concept of startup strategies refers to a series of strategies and technologies for safely and effectively initiating and operating the grid under different conditions, such as daily operation, emergency response, disaster recovery, etc[1, 3]. The main challenges faced by current startup strategies in smart grids include efficient integration and management of the increasing amount of renewable energy sources[4, 5, 48-50], ensuring grid stability and resilience in the face of extreme weather conditions and system failures[6], and handling and analyzing the growing volume of grid data to optimize operational strategies[7]. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies, especially deep learning, more and more research efforts are focusing on using these technologies to address the issues related to startup strategies in smart grids. The advantages of deep learning in data processing and pattern recognition make it a powerful tool for analyzing complex grid systems. For instance, leveraging deep learning models enables researchers to enhance the precision of grid load and energy demand predictions, as well as the assessment of fault probabilities. Consequently, this facilitates the formulation of more efficacious grid startup and operational strategies.[8]. Additionally, time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in the research of smart grid startup strategies. Grid operation data, such as loads, supply, and weather conditions, often exhibit significant temporal correlations[9, 10]. Effective time series analysis and forecasting are crucial for developing precise grid startup strategies.

Nonetheless, the accuracy of this study in handling highly nonlinear and anomalous data still needs to be improved. Another study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model[56-62] and focused on the performance of power grids under extreme weather conditions[12]. Through CNN, the study identified and analyzed power grid data patterns related to extreme climate events, guiding power grid operation under extreme conditions[13]. However, the study is not accurate enough in predicting a few extreme events, which may lead to prediction errors in practical applications. Another work adopted a graph neural network (GNN) model to analyze the interactions between power grid nodes[14]. This research reveals the complex dependencies between nodes in the power grid through GNN, providing new insights into the overall stability of the power grid. However, the scalability and efficiency of this model in large-scale power grid systems have not been fully verified.

Model Evaluation", "content": "Model Performance Metrics: To measure the effectiveness of the Transformer-LSTM-PSO model in smart grid startup prediction, we adopt specific evaluation metrics. These metrics include, but are not limited to, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared). RMSE and MAE are used to measure the prediction accuracy of the model, while R-squared is used to evaluate how well the model fits the observed data. We evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the values of these metrics to determine its predictive capabilities in smart grid launch scenarios.\nCross-Validation: We divided the dataset into multiple subsets and then trained and evaluated the model multiple times, each time using a different subset as the validation set. The most commonly used is K-fold cross-validation, where K represents the number of subsets.

The experimental results not only demonstrate the applicability of our model in the power sector but also offer robust backing for the sustainable advancement of future smart grids. The focus of this study is to address key challenges in predicting smart grid startup scenarios by developing a Transformer-LSTM-PSO model that integrates the strengths of Transformer architecture, LSTM networks, and PSO algorithms. This hybrid model aims to improve prediction accuracy, handle complex grid data efficiently, and provide consistent performance across various datasets. However, although our model achieves encouraging results in multiple aspects, there are still some shortcomings that require further improvement. Firstly, our model may face the challenge of overfitting when handling certain power datasets, particularly when dealing with small or noisy data sizes. Secondly, enhancing the interpretability of the model is essential to gain deeper insights into its prediction outcomes. Moreover, the model's complexity arises from the amalgamation of intricate neural network architectures and optimization algorithms, demanding substantial computational resources. This may constrain its applicability in real-time analysis or environments with limited computational capabilities. Lastly, the efficacy of the model heavily relies on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In cases where the available data fail to adequately capture the full spectrum of grid operations, the model's predictive accuracy could be compromised. In future research, we will continue to optimize the model, improve its robustness, and explore more effective methods to solve these problems.\nLooking ahead to future research prospects, we recognize abundant opportunities in advancing smart grid technology. Our primary objective is to broaden the model's applicability by integrating renewable energy considerations more comprehensively and addressing the complexities of power system dynamics. This strategic expansion aims to enhance our model's capability in effectively managing dynamic energy sources and diverse operational conditions. Moreover, we are committed to improving the interpretability of the model to better align with practical applications. To achieve this goal, we propose integrating advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms and feature importance analysis. These enhancements will enable us to highlight the significance of different input features and offer insights into the decision-making process of the model.

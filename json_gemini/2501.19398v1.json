{"title": "Do LLMs Strategically Reveal, Conceal, and Infer Information?\nA Theoretical and Empirical Analysis in The Chameleon Game", "authors": ["Mustafa O. Karabag", "Ufuk Topcu"], "abstract": "Large language model-based (LLM-based) agents\nhave become common in settings that include\nnon-cooperative parties. In such settings, agents'\ndecision-making needs to conceal information from\ntheir adversaries, reveal information to their coop-\nerators, and infer information to identify the other\nagents' characteristics. To investigate whether\nLLMs have these information control and decision-\nmaking capabilities, we make LLM agents play\nthe language-based hidden-identity game, The\nChameleon. In the game, a group of non-\nchameleon agents who do not know each other aim\nto identify the chameleon agent without revealing a\nsecret. The game requires the aforementioned in-\nformation control capabilities both as a chameleon\nand a non-chameleon. The empirical results show\nthat while non-chameleon LLM agents identify the\nchameleon, they fail to conceal the secret from\nthe chameleon, and their winning probability is far\nfrom the levels of even trivial strategies. To for-\nmally explain this behavior, we give a theoretical\nanalysis for a spectrum of strategies, from con-\ncealing to revealing, and provide bounds on the\nnon-chameleons' winning probability. Based on\nthe empirical results and theoretical analysis of dif-\nferent strategies, we deduce that LLM-based non-\nchameleon agents reveal excessive information to\nagents of unknown identities. Our results point to a\nweakness of contemporary LLMs, including GPT-\n4, GPT-40, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, in\nstrategic interactions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "LLM-based agents have become common in domains includ-\ning education [Xiao et al., 2023, Alier et al., 2023], health-\ncare [Karabacak and Margetis, 2023, Singhal et al., 2023],\nfinance [Wu et al., 2023, Yang et al., 2023], and software\ndevelopment [Lin et al., 2024, Dong et al., 2024]. These\nagents need to operate in the presence of other autonomous\nagents and humans where the interactions are not necessar-\nily cooperative, such as negotiation scenarios [Abdelnabi et\nal., 2024, Bianchi et al., 2024]. In these interactions, LLMs\nneed to strategically conceal information from their adver-\nsaries, reveal information to their potential cooperators, and\ninfer information to identify the characteristics of the other\nagents.\nTo investigate whether the existing LLMs have such\ninformation control and decision-making capabilities, we\nuse a language-based hidden-identity board game, The\nChameleon [Tahta, 2017]. We theoretically analyze the\nstrategies for the game and investigate the performance of\nexisting LLMs, GPT 3.5 [OpenAI, 2023a], GPT-4 [Ope-\nnAI, 2023b], GPT-40 [OpenAI, 2024], Gemini 1.5 [Google,\n2024b], and Sonnet 3.5 [Anthropic, 2024]. Our theoretical\nand empirical results for The Chameleon show that LLMs re-\nveal excessive information to agents of unknown identities,\nmaking them unsuitable for strategic interactions.\nThe Chameleon is a zero-sum hidden-identity board game\nbetween a chameleon player and N \u2013 1 non-chameleon play-\ners. The non-chameleons jointly know a set of words and a\nsecret word randomly chosen from this set, but they do not\nknow each other. The chameleon, on the other hand, does\nnot know the secret word but knows the set of potential secret\nwords. The players, including the chameleon, respond with\na single word in a randomly chosen order. Then, the players\nvote to identify the chameleon. If the chameleon is correctly\nidentified, it is asked to guess the secret word in the second\nstage. The chameleon wins the game if it is not identified\nafter voting or if it guesses the secret word correctly.\nThe game requires the non-chameleons to reveal informa-\ntion about the secret word to signal each other and avoid the\nmisidentification of the chameleon. At the same time, the\nnon-chameleons need to conceal information about the secret\nword to avoid the inference of the secret word and make the\nchameleon incorrectly guess. The voting stage requires the\nnon-chameleons to infer who the chameleon is based on the\nresponses. On the flip side, the chameleon needs to blend in\nby giving a response aligned with the non-chameleons' re-\nsponses without raising suspicion. The second stage requires\nthe chameleon to infer the secret word based on the responses.\nWe theoretically analyze the game by considering that\nthe non-chameleons can share a pre-agreed strategy. The\nchameleon knows the strategy but not the secret word. We\nfirst consider two families of stationary strategies, pairwise\nconcealing and revealing strategies, that do not take the pre-\nvious responses into account.

As LLMS\noften do not exhibit rational behavior in games, existing\nworks focused on improving the performance of LLMs by\ndeveloping agent architectures [Park et al., 2023, Yang et\nal., 2024, Thudium et al., 2024, Guo et al., 2023], fine-\ntuning LLMs [Huang et al., 2024], and using game-theoric\nsolvers [Gemp et al., 2024, Hua et al., 2024]. While most\nof the existing works focus on empirically analyzing and\nimproving the performance of LLMs for games, we provide\ntheoretical and empirical analyses for the hidden identity\ngame The Chamaleon. Our results show that the irrational\nbehavior of LLMs in strategic interactions may stem from\nlosing informational advantage as they share excessive\ninformation with other agents with unknown identities.\nSocial deduction games and LLMs: Conversation-based\nsocial deduction games, including hidden role/identity\ngames, provide a natural medium to test the capabilities of\nLLMs. Existing works showed LLMs have promising capa-\nbilities in games such as Werewolf [Xu et al., 2023a, Xu et al.,\n2023b], Diplomacy [(FAIR)\u2020 et al., 2022], Welfare Diplo-\nmacy [Mukobi et al., 2023], Hoodwinked [O'Gara, 2023],\nand Spyfall [Kim and Kim, 2023]. These games rely on open-\nended discussions and negotiations between the players, and\nexisting studies focus on evaluating or improving the empiri-\ncal performance of LLMs. We propose a new language-based\nincomplete information game benchmark, The Chameleon,\nfor LLMs. The simple nature of The Chameleon allows us\nto develop a model of the game and theoretically analyze it.\nDifferent from the existing works, we identify the strengths\nand weaknesses of LLMs based on both theory and experi-\nments. The work [Kim and Kim, 2023] made the observation\nthat non-spy players rely too much on keywords in the game\nof Spyfall, providing hints to the spy. Our theoretical and\nempirical results for The Chameleon verify this observation.\nLLMs, Lying, and Deception: Recent studies on LLMs\nshow that LLMs can lie to deceive others [Hagendorff,\n2024, B\u00fcrger et al., 2024, Hou et al., 2024] and detect de-\nceivers [Yoo and Kim, 2024]. These works show that LLMs\ncan deliberately mislead others given a context, e.g., lying\nto a thief about the location of a valuable item [Hagendorff,\n2024]. The Chameleon, on the other hand, does not require\nthe players to explicitly lie in their responses to induce false\nbeliefs. But, it requires them to be ambiguous to conceal the\nsecret word or their identity.

Without loss of generality, we assume N \u2265 3.\nThe game is played between a chameleon and N 1 non-\nchameleons. The goal of the non-chameleons is to iden-\ntify the chameleon correctly while ensuring the integrity of a\ncommon secret jointly known by them. As we further explain\nlater, The Chameleon requires players to strategically reveal,\nconceal, and infer information. We use The Chameleon as\nan example to measure how suitable large language models are\nto environments where they interact with agents of unknown\nidentities and intentions.\n3.1 Rules of The Chameleon and Notation\nWe explain the rules of The Chameleon below and provide an\nexample gameplay in Figure 1.\nPlaying order: The players uniformly randomly draw a\nplaying order o. Without loss of generality, we assume that\neach player's index is the same with its playing order, i.e.,\no = (1, ..., N).\nIdentity assignment: There is a single chameleon uni-\nformly randomly chosen from the players, and there are N-1\nnon-chameleon players. The chameleon is chosen secretly:\nThe chameleon knows its identity, but the non-chameleons\ndo not know who the chameleon is and who the other non-\nchameleons are. We denote the chameleon's index with c.\nCategory, words, and secret word: The players choose\na category C. Each category C contains K words denoted\nwith Wc. Every player knows the category C and the words\nWc. Without loss of generality, we assume these words are\nordered, i.e., Wc = {w1,...,\u03c9\u03ba}. One of the words is\nchosen to be the secret word w* uniformly randomly from\nWc. The secret word is distributed to the non-chameleons\nsecretly: Each non-chameleon knows the secret word, but the\nchameleon does not know the secret word.\nGameplay: The players play in sequentially. At turn i,\nplayer i says a response word ri that can be chosen from\na (potentially infinite) set of words that is denoted by Rc.\nPlayer i knows r1,..., ri\u22121 before saying ri.\nWe use 'The Chameleon' to refer to the game and 'the\nchameleon' to refer to the player with the chameleon identity.\nDiscussion, voting, and a second chance: After all players\ngive their responses, including the chameleon in its order, the\nplayers first discuss who the chameleon is. After the discus-\nsion, they vote to identify the chameleon. The player with the\nhighest vote is identified as the chameleon. If there is a tie,\na uniformly randomly chosen player identifies a chameleon\namong the players with the highest votes.\nRemark 1. In this paper, we do not consider the discussion\nperiod as a part of the game and make players vote at the\nsame time without seeing each other's votes.\nIf the non-chameleons correctly identify the chameleon,\nthe chameleon is given a second chance. The chameleon\nhas a single response to identify the secret word w*. The\nchameleon knows the category C, the potential secret words\nWc, and all spoken words r1,...,rn, before responding.\nWinning conditions: The game is binary zero-sum. Either\n(i) the chameleon wins, and the non-chameleons lose, (ii) or\nthe non-chameleons win and the chameleon loses.\nThe chameleon has two chances of winning the game. If\nthe players misidentify the chameleon, then the chameleon\nwins the game. If the players correctly identify the\nchameleon, then the chameleon wins if its response in the\nsecond chance is the secret word\u00b2."}, {"title": "4 Theoretical Analysis for the\nNon-Chameleon Strategies", "content": "A strategy is a player's decision-making procedure for giving\na response and voting. In this section, we consider that the\nplayers can design and share strategies before the game and\nplay the strategy during the gameplay. We consider different\nclasses of strategies and give upper and lower bounds on the\nnon-chameleons' win probability. We summarize the theoret-\nical results in Figure 2. The proofs for all technical results are\ngiven in the appendix.\nThroughout this section, we assume that players pre-agree\non a (potentially history-dependent) non-chameleon strategy\nbefore the game. After the identities are drawn, each\nnon-chameleon player follows the non during the game. The\nchameleon knows the strategy whon of the non-chameleons\nbut lacks the information of the secret word. The chameleon\nplays strategy wch during the gameplay and wch is decided\nknowing \u03c0\u03b7on. The chameleon's strategy \u03c0ch is not known by\nthe non-chameleons while they decide on whon.

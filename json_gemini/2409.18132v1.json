INTRODUCTION", "content": "To analyze the performance of neural networks, the hypothesis space represented by (infinite width) neural networks has been studied. Based on the concept of variation spaces (see [6,7]), F. Bach defined the \\( \\mathcal{F}_1 \\) spaces as an integral representation of the neural networks using the total variation norm (see [17]). In subsequent, W. E et al. defined the Barron spaces employing the path norm and showed that the \\( \\mathcal{F}_1 \\) spaces and the Barron spaces can be isometrically isomorphic when using the Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) activation function. (see [22, 25]).\nBefore the era of neural networks, one of the main topics in machine learning was the kernel method, exemplified by concepts such as Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) and Support Vector Machines (see, for example [1,10,13]). Through the sum of RKHSS, we can canonically extend an RKHS and it can be utilized to explore different features of data (see [8,14]). The concept of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBSs) is a generalization of the RKHSs, similar to how Banach spaces extend Hilbert spaces (see [11,21]). Relating to neural networks, F. Bartolucci et al. defined a class of integral RKBSs which are variants of the \\( \\mathcal{F}_1 \\) spaces (see [23,26]). They defined the integral RKBSs through the characterization theorem of the RKBS introduced by [19] which describe an RKBS using a feature space and its associated feature map.\nThe main questions of this paper are the following:\n(1) Finding a natural definition for the sum of RKBSs that is compatible with the usual direct sum of Banach spaces.\n(2) How can we decompose a class of integral RKBSs using the sum defined in question (1)?\nTo answer these questions, we define the sum of RKBSs, see Proposition 3.7, and show that the direct sum of the feature (Banach) spaces is compatible with the sum of RKBSs (Proposition 4.2). Roughly speaking, it is well-known that the space of the Radon measures can be decompose as the vast \\( \\ell^1 \\) direct sum of \\( L^1 \\) spaces. As an analogue of the fact described above, we decompose the class of integral RKBSs using the sum of p-norm RKBSs (Theorem 5.2).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the definitions and basic facts of the functional analysis. In Section 3, following [23, 26], we introduce the definition of RKBSs and related function subclasses, namely a class of integral RKBSs and a class of p-norm RKBSs. We present some basic properties of these function classes, in particular, the comparison of integral RKBSs with continuous function spaces (see Proposition 3.5). Moreover, we define the sum of RKBSs, which is a modified version of Example 3.13 in [19] and the theorem in 353p of [1], by using the characterization theorem of an RKBS. In Section 4, we state the main result of this article. We provide the compatibility between the sum of RKBSs and the direct sum of feature (Banach) spaces. In Section 5, using the compatibility (Proposition 4.2), we obtain that a class of integral RKBSs can be decomposed into the sum of p-norm RKBSs (Theorem 5.2)."}, {"title": "2. PRELIMINARIES AND NOTATIONS", "content": "In this paper, we denote \\( I \\) as a non-empty index set and the set \\( \\{1, ..., n\\} \\) is denoted by \\( [n] \\). We consistently use \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) as conjugate indices, where \\( p \\) satisfies \\( 1 < p < \\infty \\). The data space is represented as \\( X \\), and the parameter space as \\( \\Omega \\). For convenience, we assume that \\( X \\) and \\( \\Omega \\) are compact subsets of \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) and \\( \\mathbb{R}^D \\) for some \\( d, D\\in \\mathbb{N} \\), respectively. Furthermore, we use the notation \\( \\simeq \\) to denote isomorphisms between vector spaces and the notation \\( \\approx \\) to denote isometric isomorphisms between Banach spaces.\n2.1. Direct sum of normed vector spaces. Let \\( \\{a_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) be a family of elements in a Hausdorff commutative topological group (HCTG) \\( H \\). Define \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) as the collection of all finite subsets of \\( I \\), and order \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) by inclusion. Then \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) becomes a directed set. For each \\( F \\in \\mathcal{F} \\), define \\( a_F := \\sum_{i \\in F} a_i \\). Since \\( F \\) is a finite set, \\( a_F \\) would be well-defined. Thus, \\( (a_F)_{F\\in \\mathcal{F}} \\) is a net in \\( H \\). The family \\( \\{a_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) is said to be summable if the net \\( (a_F)_{F\\in \\mathcal{F}} \\) converges. In this case, the limit is called the sum of the family \\( \\{a_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\), and we denote it by \\( \\sum_{i\\in I}^H a_i \\). When we consider sums in the norm topology of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), we use the term \\( \\sum_{i\\in I} a_i \\) instead of \\( \\sum_{i\\in I}^{\\mathbb{R}} a_i \\). The contents related to the summable family in HCTG and \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) can be found in III. \\( \\S \\)5. and IV. \\( \\S \\)7. of [3] respectively. We use the properties of summability discussed there without further mention.\nFor a given index set \\( I \\neq \\emptyset \\), let \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) be a family of sets indexed by \\( I \\). Then the direct product of the sets in \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) is defined by \\( \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i := \\{x : I \\rightarrow \\bigcup_{i\\in I} X_i : x(i) \\in X_i \\text{ for all } i \\in I\\} \\). When we assume that \\( X_i \\neq \\emptyset \\) for all \\( i \\in I \\), by the axiom of choice, \\( \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\) is the non-empty set. In this case, for \\( j \\in I \\), we can define \\( p_j : \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\rightarrow X_j \\) by \\( p_j(x) = x(j) \\) for \\( x \\in \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\). And we call \\( p_j \\) is the \\( j \\)-th canonical projection. By abuse of notation, for any \\( x \\in \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\), we denote \\( x \\) by \\( (x_i)_{i\\in I} \\) which means \\( x(j) = x_j \\in X_j \\) for all \\( j \\in I \\). When \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) is a collection of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\)-vector spaces, the direct product of \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) is the vector space \\( \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\) with componentwise addition and scalar multiplication. In this case, the canonical projections are linear maps. Furthermore, if \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) are topological spaces, then we can define the direct product of \\( \\{X_i\\}_{i\\in I} \\) by giving a topology on \\( \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i \\), called the product topology. Under this situation, the canonical projections are continuous maps.\nLet \\( \\{X_i : i \\in I\\} \\) be a collection of normed vector spaces indexed by \\( I \\). Then we can define the direct sum of the normed spaces \\( \\{X_i : i \\in I\\} \\) as follows:\nDefinition 2.1 (The direct sum of normed vector spaces [20]). For \\( 1 \\leq p < \\infty \\), we define\n\\[\n \\bigoplus_{i\\in I}^p X_i := \\{x \\in \\prod_{i\\in I} X_i : \\sum_{i\\in I} ||x(i)||^p_{X_i} < \\infty \\}\n\\]\nas a normed vector space equipped with the norm \\( ||x||_{\\bigoplus_{i\\in I}^p X_i} = \\left[ \\sum_{i\\in I} ||x(i)||^p_{X_i} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\).

Let \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) be conjugate indices with \\( 1 < p < \\infty \\). We can obtain the following relationship between the duality and the direct sum (see III. \\( \\S \\)5.

When we consider \\( \\mathbb{R}^X = \\prod_{x \\in X} \\mathbb{R}_x \\), where \\( \\mathbb{R}_x \\) is just a copy of \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) for each \\( x \\in X \\), there is a natural topological structure called the product topology. Equivalently, it is the initial topology with respect to the family of canonical projections \\( \\{p_x : \\mathbb{R}^X \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_x\\}_{x\\in X} \\). Since this topology is compatible with the vector space structure of \\( \\mathbb{R}^X \\), \\( \\mathbb{R}^X \\) becomes a Hausdorff topological vector space (HTVS). Thus, we may consider a summable family \\( (a_i)_{i\\in I} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^d \\) and denote its sum in \\( \\mathbb{R}^X \\) by \\( \\sum_{i\\in I}^{\\mathbb{R}^X} a_i \\) if it exists.\nLet \\( V \\) be a linear subspace of \\( \\mathbb{R}^X \\).

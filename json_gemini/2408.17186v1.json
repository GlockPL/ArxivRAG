Anthropogenic interference can affect the ge-\nnetic structure of seaweed populations, and a cybernetic sys-\ntem exists among seaweed, marine fungi, valuable bioprod-\nucts, and human activity.\nInspired by this cybernetic system, our work \u201cBene-\nfit Game: Alien Seaweed Swarms\" aims to create digital\necologies using Procedural Content Generation via Machine\nLearning (PCGML) to generate a virtual marine environment\nof seaweed swarms and symbiotic fungi. The audience in-\nteracts with valuable game tokens to affect the growth of\nseaweed swarms. A healthy seaweed ecosystem can pro-\nduce more valuable game tokens as profits, but excessive har-\nvest can lead to the extinction of the seaweed ecologies. At\nthis point, the environment would indicate that the seaweed\necosystem needs more tokens and time to recover. The au-\ndience as players aim to find a sustainable balance between\nhuman activities and the potential benefits and risks of sea-\nweed aquaculture.\nThe contribution of our work includes the development\nof a virtual seaweed ecosystem generated in real-time using\nPCGML technology (Fig. 1), and an interactive gameplay in-\nstallation (Fig. 8). Our work is an artistic game rather than\nsimulating the reality. Ultimately, we hope to foster greater\necological consciousness and sustainability."}, {"title": "Background", "content": "As Jason W. Moore argues in his book Anthropocene or Cap-\nitalocene: Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism [1]\nthe rise of capitalism and its exploitation of natural resources\nhas led to a fundamental transformation of the earth's ecosys-\ntems, creating what some refer to as the Anthropocene era.\nThis era is characterized by the domination of humans over\nnature, with the pursuit of profit and economic growth tak-\ning precedence over environmental sustainability. A History\nof the World in Seven Cheap Things [2] further argues that\nthe exploitation of cheap nature, labor, and energy has been a\ndriving force behind the expansion of capitalism and the col-\nonization of new territories. \u201cNature\u201d is not a thing but a way\nof organizing, representing the cheapening of life, yanked\ninto processes of exchange and profit, denominated and con-\ntrolled by capitalism. There is nothing like an ecological\ncrisis to remind civilization that nature is never cheap. One\nshould rethink the relationship between humans and nature.\nCharles Robert Darwin [3] explored how artificial selec-\ntion can influence the evolution of plants and animals. Re-\ncent research on seaweed [4] has further explored this idea,\nhighlighting the impact of human colonization on the ge-\nnetic structure of seaweed populations. Human activity in\nnew territories can have significant consequences for the nat-\nural world, including changes to the genetic makeup of plant\npopulations. These species are considered alien species in\nnon-local areas under human activity. Laminaria saccha-\nrina (known by the common name sugar kelp) is a representa-\ntive species with commercial value, as it can be used as food,\nraw material for skincare products, and medicine. Research\nshows that this species' colonization history originated in the\nnorthwest Pacific, then crossed to the northeast Pacific in the\nMiocene. It also lived in the Arctic and northeast Atlantic,\nand postglacial recolonization led to its secondary contact in\nthe Canadian Arctic [4]. This colonization history probably\ncontributed to its use as \u201cKomb", "control and communica-\ntion in the animal and the machine [5],": "nd has been applied\nto a wide range of fields, including biology, engineering, and\nart. In the context of seaweed aquaculture, cybernetic ap-\nproaches have been used to model and optimize the growth\nof seaweed populations, as well as to explore the potential\nfor artificial propagation and colonization. In the cybernetic\nsystem of seaweed agriculture, there is a human link in the\n\"chain of transmission and return of information [5],"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Environmental Sustainability\nThe concept of environmental sustainability is crucial in the\nart field, and many artists are interested in designing sustain-\nable systems. For example, PlantConnect [7] is a real-time\nartwork that explores human-plant interaction through a sys-\ntem that incorporates bioelectricity, light, sound, CO2, pho-\ntosynthesis, and computational intelligence. This circuit en-\nhances informational linkages between humans, plants, bac-\nteria, and the physical environment. Wayterways [8] cre-\nates a multi-channel audiovisual system to increase aware-\nness of the fragile relationship between people and water in\nthe Okanagan Valley.\nMany video games also focus on ecology and sustainabil-\nity. In ecoOcean [9], four players are required to fish within\nthe same ecosystem. If everyone catches as many fish as pos-\nsible, the ecosystem will quickly deplete. Players need to\ncommunicate and adhere to common rules in order to achieve\nsustainable maximization of benefits. Similarly, games such\nas Working with Water and Eco [10, 11] aim to engage players\nin contemplating the balance between harvesting natural re-\nsources and protecting the ecosystem. Our game also encour-\nges the audience to explore how to interact with the digital\nseaweed ecology in a sustainable way.\nInteractive Alife Artwork\nThere have already been many existing artists and artworks\nin artificial life [12] and games that discussed about ecol-\nogy system. The most famous and classic one is Conway's\nGame of Life [13]. In the 1970s, John Horton Conway uses\ncellular automaton (CA) to create Computational Ecosys-\ntems (CEs) [14]. More recently, influenced by the previ-\nous artificial life games such as SimCity and The Sims. Ian\nCheng creates a series of works, Emissaries [15] which he\ndescribes as a \u201cvirtual ecosystem\" using modern AI technol-\nogy. Besides the complex ecosystem, Mimicry [16] by Zi-\nwei Wu and Lingdong Huang explores the real-time texture"}, {"title": "PCG Game", "content": "\"Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is the algorithmic\ncreation of game content with limited or indirect user in-\nput\" [19]. PCG is extensively utilized in the generation\nof game assets. Eman et al. develops a game A Walk\nAlone [20] that employs PCG for creating buildings, while\nAaron Oldenburg integrates PCG in his art games [21] to gen-\nerate psychedelic landscapes that resemble everyday halluci-\nnations, spiritual encounters, and so on.\nOver the past decade, PCGML has gained momentum,\nprimarily focusing on the generation of 2D game levels or\nsprites. Nonetheless, research has also been conducted on the\ncreation of 3D models [22, 23]. Our work employs PCGML\nto generate parameter-driven 3D seaweed models."}, {"title": "Benefit Game: Alien Seaweed Swarms", "content": "Game System Design\nThe essence of our gameplay is the interaction between\nthe audience and the digital ecology we create, consisting\nof a Seaweed Swarm System and a symbiotic Fungi Sys-\ntem (Fig. 3).\nSeaweed Swarm System In real life, humans invest in sea-\nweed aquaculture for profit. Similarly, in our game, the au-\ndience can harvest virtual seaweed by inserting game tokens.\nThe harvested seaweed is periodically (every 20 seconds) set-\ntled based on its selling price and returned to the audience as\ngame tokens for further interaction. The price of virtual sea-\nweed is determined by its shape, which is calculated based on\nthe blade width, blade length, blade density, and stipe length\nof the harvested seaweed.\nFungi System In the process of seaweed aquaculture, par-\nasitic oomycetes can cause rot disease on the seaweed\nblades, leading to irregular rotted spots and reduced selling\nprice [24]. However, certain symbiotic fungi can kill the\noomycetes and treat the disease [25, 26, 27, 24]. Our game\ndesign includes a Fungi System where the audience can cul-\ntivate fungi by inserting game tokens, gradually improving\nthe seaweed's health condition. The rotted spots on the sea-\nweed blades will become smaller and less dense (detailed in\nthe Technical Implementation's Disease Effect section), and\nthe seaweed's selling price will gradually increase. When\nthe number of fungi is sufficient to kill the oomycetes, the\nseaweed swarm will recover completely. Oomycetes, how-\never, will periodically respawn, causing the seaweed to be-\ncome diseased again. The audience needs to balance between\nharvesting seaweed for profit and treating seaweed disease."}, {"title": "Ecological Index", "content": "We define a global variable, the ecolog-\nical index (EI) to represent the impact of the audience's in-\nteraction with the Seaweed Swarm System on the ecosystem.\nDuring seaweed aquaculture, human activities can impact the\necosystem positively or negatively, which in turn affects the\nSeaweed Swarm System and the Fungi System, including the\ngrowth rate of seaweed, the curing difficulty of rot disease,\nand the respawn rate of pathogenic oomycetes. A higher EI\nindicates a better ecological condition, while a negative EI\nrepresents ecological crisis. As shown in Fig. 2 The rela-\ntionship between EI and the audience's token insertions for\nthe Seaweed Swarm System is a periodic function consisting\nof three sine functions, corresponding to the \u201cprosperity of\ngrowth\" stage, the \"decline of growth\" stage, and the \"eco-\nlogical crisis\" stage. We will provide a detailed explanation\nof how EI affects the Seaweed Swarm System and the Fungi\nSystem."}, {"title": "Seaweed Swarm System and EI", "content": "EI is directly proportional to the growth rate of seaweed in\nthe seaweed swarm.

Anthropogenic interference can affect the ge-\nnetic structure of seaweed populations, and a cybernetic sys-\ntem exists among seaweed, marine fungi, valuable bioprod-\nucts, and human activity.\nInspired by this cybernetic system, our work \u201cBene-\nfit Game: Alien Seaweed Swarms\" aims to create digital\necologies using Procedural Content Generation via Machine\nLearning (PCGML) to generate a virtual marine environment\nof seaweed swarms and symbiotic fungi. The audience in-\nteracts with valuable game tokens to affect the growth of\nseaweed swarms. A healthy seaweed ecosystem can pro-\nduce more valuable game tokens as profits, but excessive har-\nvest can lead to the extinction of the seaweed ecologies. At\nthis point, the environment would indicate that the seaweed\necosystem needs more tokens and time to recover. The au-\ndience as players aim to find a sustainable balance between\nhuman activities and the potential benefits and risks of sea-\nweed aquaculture.\nThe contribution of our work includes the development\nof a virtual seaweed ecosystem generated in real-time using\nPCGML technology (Fig. 1), and an interactive gameplay in-\nstallation (Fig. 8). Our work is an artistic game rather than\nsimulating the reality. Ultimately, we hope to foster greater\necological consciousness and sustainability."}, {"title": "Background", "content": "As Jason W. Moore argues in his book Anthropocene or Cap-\nitalocene: Nature, History, and the Crisis of Capitalism [1]\nthe rise of capitalism and its exploitation of natural resources\nhas led to a fundamental transformation of the earth's ecosys-\ntems, creating what some refer to as the Anthropocene era.\nThis era is characterized by the domination of humans over\nnature, with the pursuit of profit and economic growth tak-\ning precedence over environmental sustainability. A History\nof the World in Seven Cheap Things [2] further argues that\nthe exploitation of cheap nature, labor, and energy has been a\ndriving force behind the expansion of capitalism and the col-\nonization of new territories. \u201cNature\u201d is not a thing but a way\nof organizing, representing the cheapening of life, yanked\ninto processes of exchange and profit, denominated and con-\ntrolled by capitalism. There is nothing like an ecological\ncrisis to remind civilization that nature is never cheap. One\nshould rethink the relationship between humans and nature.\nCharles Robert Darwin [3] explored how artificial selec-\ntion can influence the evolution of plants and animals. Re-\ncent research on seaweed [4] has further explored this idea,\nhighlighting the impact of human colonization on the ge-\nnetic structure of seaweed populations. Human activity in\nnew territories can have significant consequences for the nat-\nural world, including changes to the genetic makeup of plant\npopulations. These species are considered alien species in\nnon-local areas under human activity. Laminaria saccha-\nrina (known by the common name sugar kelp) is a representa-\ntive species with commercial value, as it can be used as food,\nraw material for skincare products, and medicine. Research\nshows that this species' colonization history originated in the\nnorthwest Pacific, then crossed to the northeast Pacific in the\nMiocene. It also lived in the Arctic and northeast Atlantic,\nand postglacial recolonization led to its secondary contact in\nthe Canadian Arctic [4]. This colonization history probably\ncontributed to its use as \u201cKomb", "control and communica-\ntion in the animal and the machine [5],": "nd has been applied\nto a wide range of fields, including biology, engineering, and\nart. In the context of seaweed aquaculture, cybernetic ap-\nproaches have been used to model and optimize the growth\nof seaweed populations, as well as to explore the potential\nfor artificial propagation and colonization. In the cybernetic\nsystem of seaweed agriculture, there is a human link in the\n\"chain of transmission and return of information [5],", "Benefit Game": "Alien\nSeaweed Swarms"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Environmental Sustainability\nThe concept of environmental sustainability is crucial in the\nart field, and many artists are interested in designing sustain-\nable systems. For example, PlantConnect [7] is a real-time\nartwork that explores human-plant interaction through a sys-\ntem that incorporates bioelectricity, light, sound, CO2, pho-\ntosynthesis, and computational intelligence. This circuit en-\nhances informational linkages between humans, plants, bac-\nteria, and the physical environment. Wayterways [8] cre-\nates a multi-channel audiovisual system to increase aware-\nness of the fragile relationship between people and water in\nthe Okanagan Valley.\nMany video games also focus on ecology and sustainabil-\nity. In ecoOcean [9], four players are required to fish within\nthe same ecosystem. If everyone catches as many fish as pos-\nsible, the ecosystem will quickly deplete. Players need to\ncommunicate and adhere to common rules in order to achieve\nsustainable maximization of benefits. Similarly, games such\nas Working with Water and Eco [10, 11] aim to engage players\nin contemplating the balance between harvesting natural re-\nsources and protecting the ecosystem. Our game also encour-\nges the audience to explore how to interact with the digital\nseaweed ecology in a sustainable way.\nInteractive Alife Artwork\nThere have already been many existing artists and artworks\nin artificial life [12] and games that discussed about ecol-\nogy system. The most famous and classic one is Conway's\nGame of Life [13]. In the 1970s, John Horton Conway uses\ncellular automaton (CA) to create Computational Ecosys-\ntems (CEs) [14]. More recently, influenced by the previ-\nous artificial life games such as SimCity and The Sims. Ian\nCheng creates a series of works, Emissaries [15] which he\ndescribes as a \u201cvirtual ecosystem\" using modern AI technol-\nogy. Besides the complex ecosystem, Mimicry [16] by Zi-\nwei Wu and Lingdong Huang explores the real-time texture\ngeneration of virtual insects based on a living environment.\nMore conceptually, CMD: Experiments in Bio Algorithmic\nPolitics [17] by Michael Sedbon challenges the cybernetic\nforms of control between two artificial ecosystems sharing\nthe same light source. Totem is a dynamic art project that\nproduces complex patterns in light using the self-developed\nsoftware autonomX [18]. By utilizing the generator of au-\ntonomX which is a grid-based wrapper for an AI and/or ALife\nalgorithm, Totem presents a performance for two human per-\nformers and eight spiking neural networks interacting with\neach other. Our work builds a playable, real-time artificial\nlife digital ecology and invites audience interaction through\nthis dynamic system.\""}, {"title": "PCG Game", "content": "\"Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is the algorithmic\ncreation of game content with limited or indirect user in-\nput"}, {"title": "Benefit Game: Alien Seaweed Swarms", "content": "Game System Design\nThe essence of our gameplay is the interaction between\nthe audience and the digital ecology we create, consisting\nof a Seaweed Swarm System and a symbiotic Fungi Sys-\ntem (Fig. 3).\nSeaweed Swarm System In real life, humans invest in sea-\nweed aquaculture for profit. Similarly, in our game, the au-\ndience can harvest virtual seaweed by inserting game tokens.\nThe harvested seaweed is periodically (every 20 seconds) set-\ntled based on its selling price and returned to the audience as\ngame tokens for further interaction. The price of virtual sea-\nweed is determined by its shape, which is calculated based on\nthe blade width, blade length, blade density, and stipe length\nof the harvested seaweed.\nFungi System In the process of seaweed aquaculture, par-\nasitic oomycetes can cause rot disease on the seaweed\nblades, leading to irregular rotted spots and reduced selling\nprice [24]. However, certain symbiotic fungi can kill the\noomycetes and treat the disease [25, 26, 27, 24]. Our game\ndesign includes a Fungi System where the audience can cul-\ntivate fungi by inserting game tokens, gradually improving\nthe seaweed's health condition. The rotted spots on the sea-\nweed blades will become smaller and less dense (detailed in\nthe Technical Implementation's Disease Effect section), and\nthe seaweed's selling price will gradually increase. When\nthe number of fungi is sufficient to kill the oomycetes, the\nseaweed swarm will recover completely. Oomycetes, how-\never, will periodically respawn, causing the seaweed to be-\ncome diseased again. The audience needs to balance between\nharvesting seaweed for profit and treating seaweed disease.\nEcological Index We define a global variable, the ecolog-\nical index (EI) to represent the impact of the audience's in-\nteraction with the Seaweed Swarm System on the ecosystem.\nDuring seaweed aquaculture, human activities can impact the\necosystem positively or negatively, which in turn affects the\nSeaweed Swarm System and the Fungi System, including the\ngrowth rate of seaweed, the curing difficulty of rot disease,\nand the respawn rate of pathogenic oomycetes. A higher EI\nindicates a better ecological condition, while a negative EI\nrepresents ecological crisis. As shown in Fig. 2 The rela-\ntionship between EI and the audience's token insertions for\nthe Seaweed Swarm System is a periodic function consisting\nof three sine functions, corresponding to the \u201cprosperity of\ngrowth\" stage, the \"decline of growth\" stage, and the \"eco-\nlogical crisis\" stage. We will provide a detailed explanation\nof how EI affects the Seaweed Swarm System and the Fungi\nSystem.\""}, {"title": "Seaweed Swarm System and EI:", "content": "EI is directly proportional to the growth rate of seaweed in\nthe seaweed swarm. In the \u201cprosperity of growth\" stage,\nhuman interactions positively influence the ecology and\npromote seaweed growth. Seaweed grows faster as tokens\nare inserted. In the \"decline of growth\" stage, human in-\nteractions disrupt the ecology, resulting in a slowdown of\nseaweed growth until it stops completely. When EI reaches\nthe \"ecological crisis\" stage, seaweed growth completely\nstops, but token insertions continue to harvest seaweed.\nIf the remaining number of seaweed is sufficient, contin-\nued token insertions can gradually restore EI to the starting\npoint of the next cycle, representing ecological restoration.\nOtherwise, continued human interactions may lead to the\ncomplete extinction of the entire seaweed swarm, a severe\nconsequence of excessive harvesting. In this situation, the\naudience still needs to keep inserting tokens to restore EI\nto the starting point of the next cycle. However, since all\nseaweed has gone extinct, these token insertions will not\nharvest any seaweed and will not yield any profits. This is\ndesigned as ecological repayment.\nIn addition to affecting seaweed growth rate, EI also in-\nfluences five natural factors (also defined as global vari-\nables) in the ecosystem: water temperature, salinity, flow\nvelocity, irradiation, and nutrient concentrations. These\nfactors determine the shape of newly grown seaweed in\nreal-time (Fig. 4), which further decides the selling price\nof the seaweed. Details on this aspect will be discussed\nin the Technical Implementation section when introducing\nSeaweed Generation.\""}, {"title": "Fungi System and EI:", "content": "Although in our design, audience token insertions for the\nFungi System do not affect EI, EI can influence the Fungi\nSystem. As aforementioned, each time the audience in-\nserts a coin for the Fungi System, a fungus can be cul-\ntivated to treat diseases caused by oomycetes, which in-\ncreases the selling price of seaweed. The curing difficulty\nis inversely proportional to the EI. The better the ecolog-\nical condition with a larger EI, the fewer fungi needed to\nkill the oomycete, and vice versa.\nMeanwhile, the killed oomycete periodically respawns, re-\ninfecting the seaweed swarm. The oomycete's respawn\nrate is inversely proportional to EI too. A smaller EI indi-\ncates worse ecology, leading to faster oomycete respawn-\ning and a quick re-infection of the previously healthy sea-\nweed swarm."}, {"title": "Technical Implementation", "content": "Seaweed Generation\nAs aforementioned, in our Benefit Game, the shape of each\nseaweed directly determines its selling price. Therefore, in-\nstead of using random functions or self-defined rule-based\nmethods to determine the shape of seaweeds, we believe that\nit is more appropriate to train a machine learning model us-\ning real-world seaweed aquaculture data and PCGML to de-\ntermine the shape and generate seaweed. Our training set in-\ncludes data collected from research on seaweed aquaculture\nin the real world [28, 29, 30, 31], which demonstrate the ef-\nfects of five natural factors (water temperature, water salinity,\nwater flow velocity, irradiation, and nutrient concentrations)\non seaweed yield. Notably, our dataset only includes the re-\nlationship between natural factors and seaweed yield, and not\nseaweed shape. After training the model, we map the out-\nput (seaweed yield) to the seaweed shape to generate various\nseaweed variants (Fig. 6).\nTo handle the non-linear relationships in our collected\ndataset, we choose to use Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) mod-\nels. Since our data comes from various sources and is inde-\npendently associated with the natural factors mentioned ear-\nlier, we train separate MLPs for each factor. With the help of\nthe Barracuda package in Unity, we can easily use our trained\nMLP models within the Unity environment.\nAfter training, we obtain a model with five natural factors\nas input and four seaweed yields as output (Fig. 4). There-\nfore, we set five global variables in the game corresponding\nto these natural factors as inputs to the model. These vari-\nables change with the EI, indicating the impact of EI on the\nentire seaweed ecology. We map the output of the model to\nfour parameters that determine the seaweed shape: the width\nof the seaweed blade is determined by salinity, the length of\nthe blade is determined by water flow velocity, the density of\nthe blade is determined by water temperature, and the length\nof the stipe is determined by irradiation and nutrient concen-\ntration. We then transfer the real-time calculated mapped pa-\nrameters of the seaweed shape to the Houdini plugin in Unity\nfor procedural modeling of seaweed variants with different\nshapes."}, {"title": "Fungi Generation", "content": "We procedurally generate two types of fungus inspired by\nPenicillium (blue ones in Fig. 5) and Aspergillus (purple\none in Fig. 5), which are symbiosis with seaweeds and\ncan treat seaweed diseases caused by oomycetes in the real\nworld [24, 25]. The cylindrical structures of the stipes, metu-\nlae, and phialides of the fungi are initially generated as lines\nand subsequently assigned thickness and width. The coni-\ndia of the fungi are represented directly using spheres. As\nboth fungi resemble tree structures and form branches at dif-\nferent levels, we employ a parent-children structure during\ngeneration. The stipe of each fungi is the parent, with metula\nbranches as the children of the stipe, and phialide branches\nas the children of the metula branches. Each phialide branch\nalso has several spherical conidia as its children. Rules are es-\ntablished for each level of the parent-children structure based\non range intervals instead of fixed numbers. For example, the\nnumber of child branches can be randomly determined from\na range of 2 to 5. As shown in Fig. 5, one of the blue fungi\nhas only two branches, while the other has five branches. In\naddition, the length, thickness, angle of branch distribution\ncan also be randomized within range intervals, resulting in\nthe generation of numerous fungi that follow the same rules\nand have similar structures but unique shapes."}, {"title": "Disease Effect", "content": "To simulate rot diseases caused by parasitic oomycetes on the\nblades of Alien Seaweed, we add irregular glowing patches\nto each individual seaweed blade. We achieve this effect by\nwriting a fragment shader within Unity's node-based shader\neditor. We use gradient noise to generate floating-point val-\nues ranging from 0 to 1. Subsequently, a step function is\nemployed to map these floating-point numbers to either 0 or\n1. Areas that output a value of 0 form the base color of the\nseaweed, while areas that output a value of 1 form the light\npatch areas. This step function has an adjustable parameter called\n\u201cedge\u201d, where any floating-point number greater than \"edge\"\nis mapped to 1, and vice versa for 0. By adjusting \u201cedge\u201d,\nwe can control the ratio of the base color area to the light\npatch area, thus simulating seaweed in different health condi-\ntions. The healthier the seaweed is, the larger the \u201cedge\u201d will\nbe, causing fewer light patch areas (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the\nscale of the gradient noise can also be adjusted to control the\nsize of the glowing patches corresponding to the health con-\ndition of the seaweed swarm."}, {"title": "Installation", "content": "Our game runs on a computer host and all electronic compo-\nnents are controlled by an Arduino board.

It consists of a two-tiered cabinet where the bot-\ntom houses the computer host, Arduino board, and power\nsupplies, while the upper serves as a space for audience in-\nteraction and game token storage. We add a plane supported\nby an angled structure at the top of the cabinet to place dis-\nplay devices for the Seaweed Swarm System and the Fungi\nSystem separately.\nToken Acceptance On the right side of the upper cabinet's\nfront surface, we install a token acceptor (No.1 in Fig. 8) to\nsense valid game token insertion and return non-game tokens\nto the audience. It will transmit a signal to the Arduino if a\nvalid token is sensed.\nToken Return We place a token returner (No.2 in Fig. 8)\nbelow the token acceptor with an open top to catch the\ndropped tokens. The returner consists of an IR sensor for\ncounting tokens and an electrical motor. When the power is\non, the motor rotates continuously and dispenses coins from\nthe side of the returner while the IR sensor counts the num-\nber of coins dispensed. We use a relay module to connect\nthe returner's power supply so that when the Arduino emits a\nhigh voltage, the returner starts dispensing coins. When the\nnumber of coins dispensed recorded by the IR sensor reaches\nthe desired amount, the Arduino emits a low voltage to stop\nthe coin dispensing.

This exhibition provided an\nopportunity to test our installation, observe the audience's re-\naction, and collect feedback on their interactions (Fig. 9). We\nreceived many positive reviews during this exhibition, and ac-\ncordingly, we also identified issues that need to be addressed.\nFor example, children were likely keen on harvesting sea-\nweed by continuously inserting tokens into the installation.\nThe activity resulted in a quick profit, but also caused imme-\ndiate damage to the ecosystem, which will require time for\nthe environment to recover. During this waiting period, the\nchildren quickly became bored and wanted the seaweed to\ngrow faster. The vast majority of the participants enjoyed the\nfeedback of earning money, and many would stay in front of\nthe installation for a long time. Additionally, it is interesting\nto note that some participants were obsessed with inserting\ntokens for the Fungi System, hoping to kill the oomycete.\nThey were happy when enough fungi were cultivated to kill\nthe oomycete but soon became annoyed once a new oomycete\ngrew. Many participants were interested in the story be-\nhind the seaweed and tried to connect it to human activities\nthroughout history, such as the development of seaweed in\nskincare products and food.\nAfter communicating with the audience, we found that\nmost of them believed that our game increased their aware-\nness of the importance of ecological sustainability and en-\ncouraged them to find a balance in their interactions. Some\nwitnessed the ecosystem crisis caused by over-harvesting,\nleading to the extinction of the seaweed ecologies, and felt a\nsense of loss and a desire to restore the ecosystem to a healthy\nstate as soon as possible. Some even spontaneously advised\nothers who blindly harvested seaweed for profits to consider\nthe impact of their behavior on the current seaweed growth\nrate, remaining seaweed quantity, and ecological conditions.\nWe received feedback from the audience who found it not\nintuitive to switch interaction targets and use the same token\nacceptor for two systems. Although we display the current\ninteraction target on the TFT screen, the audience often over-\nlooks it and relies on observing which system responds after\ntoken insertion. Also, some participants wished us to present\nmore information about the current ecological state, such as\na real-time display of the seaweed growth rate curve, to help\nthem interact sustainably with the seaweed ecosystem.\nThrough gameplay, we aim to foster a deeper understand-\ning of the Capitalocene and Anthropocene among the audi-\nence from a first-person perspective, prompting players to\nquestion and reflect on the impact of their behavior on eco-\nnomic growth and environmental stewardship."}, {"title": "Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "We have developed an ecological game that creates a virtual\nenvironment of the seaweed ecosystem.

Timely and accurate monitoring of these shocks is critical for crafting effective responses and enhancing economic resilience. However, traditional methods for measuring the impacts of such disruptions - such as surveys and administrative data are often limited by costs, time lags, and coverage.\nIn this study, we introduce the Web-Based Affectedness Indicator (WAI), a scalable and cost-effective tool for real-time monitoring of economic disruptions at the firm level. By analyzing textual data from millions of company websites, WAI provides granular insights into how firms experience and respond to external shocks. This methodology overcomes traditional limitations by leveraging ubiquitous online content and state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to generate a dynamic and comprehensive view of economic affectedness.\nWhile the Covid-19 pandemic serves as a prominent example to illustrate WAI's capabilities, the method's applicability extends far beyond public health crises. WAI can provide information on a wide range of challenges, including supply chain disruptions, financial crises, and climate-related shocks. By offering real-time, high-resolution insights, it provides a transformative tool for policymakers, businesses, and researchers seeking to understand and mitigate the impacts of global disruptions.\nOur novel method substantially improves on existing approaches in the literature. Several surveys have been conducted to analyze how firms have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, there exist several survey-based studies investigating the relationship between productivity and firm resilience during the Covid-19 crisis. As an alternative to survey data, administrative or accounting data can be used to analyze the economic impact of the Covid-19 crisis. Various studies further analyze the effectiveness of Covid-19 policy support measures. The above mentioned data sources are undeniably valuable. However, they come with some limitations. Surveys, for example, can be expensive to conduct and can suffer from low participation rates, particularly during periods of a crisis. Accounting data, at the firm or national level, might be difficult to access, have only partial coverage, and typically becomes available only with a significant delay. Our study aims at overcoming these limitations and adds to an emerging body of literature that uses \"text as data\" to examine the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 crisis, while broadening the existing literature that has been limited to a single country or publicly listed firms. Notably, sample sizes in the above mentioned studies typically range in a few thousand companies, while we cover over 5 million public and private companies.\nThe WAI workflow is illustrated in Figure 1 (see Methods for further details). Our content extraction process involves downloading and analyzing company websites from the internet archive Common Crawl, and identifying paragraphs mentioning Covid-related keywords. Using a large language model (Llama 3.1) through a simple few-shot prompt method, we then classify the severity of impact on firms by scoring the affectedness and tagging specific aspects such as facility closures or supply chain issues. By analyzing multiple crawls of the same company's website in combination with location and industry information, we are able to track changes over time and analyze firm-level impacts across sectors and space.\nWhile almost all firms maintain a website nowadays, it is not obvious that the content on a website can be used as an economic shock indicator. To validate WAI as a real-time economic shock monitoring tool, we compare it with (i) alternative measures for Covid-19 policy interventions that are only available at the aggregate (state or country) level and (ii) firm performance measures from balance sheet data (sales growth or stock market valuations) for a subset of publicly listed firms.\nFor our validation exercise, we first consider Covid-19 pandemic policy responses in the US and Europe. Figure 2 shows the economic affectedness from Covid-19 across the US and the four largest states within the US (California, Florida, Texas and New York). Figure 3 shows the affectedness in Europe and among major European economies (United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain). Both figures show the share of companies with the highest level of impact according to WAI (a score of 3 on a scale from 0 to 3) for each country and crawl. As an alternative affectedness measure, that is available at this level of aggregation (but not at the firm-level), the figures also show the government response stringency index of the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)."}, {"title": "", "content": "firms, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between WAI and OxCGRT (of the first differences of the two times series) are shown. The figures illustrate a strong correlation between the two measures. This shows that when aggregating WAI at the state level it can accurately measure the economic shock stemming from Covid-19 policy interventions.\nComparing the OxCGRT stringency index with WAI in Figures 2 and 3, respectively, we see that in the early stages of the pandemic, the stringency index shows a steeper increase than WAI and that WAI starts to increase only with a small time lag after the stringency index. This reflects a delay in the companies' affectedness from the policy interventions possibly due to the existence of inventory stocks or excess capacities that allowed firms to absorb temporarily the impact of the shock. Moreover, disruptions in the companies' operations might only surface with a delay, or firms might initially have anticipated that the polices would only be in place for a short time period. However, as policy interventions persisted over time, WAI and stringency index become more closely aligned. In particular, as more drastic measures such as workplace closures and stay-at-home requirements were lifted, WAI reacts almost instantaneously by showing lower levels of affectedness.\nTo further evaluate the relevance of WAI for individual firm performance we run a panel regression with quarterly sales growth (in %) and stock market valuations as dependent variables using WAI intensity levels of Covid-19 impact ranging from mild, to moderate and severely affected as predictors with various controls (see Methods). The estimation results are shown in Figure 4 for the sample periods 2017 to 2022 with quarterly balance sheet data for around 30 thousand publicly listed firms (from S&P's Compustat North America and Global). In the simplest specification, we include firm-level fixed effects, which capture factors such as a firm's propensity to use its website to communicate its exposure to external shocks, and quarterly time fixed effects"}, {"title": "", "content": "which capture firm-invariant time trends such as the cross-regional temporal evolution of the pandemic. The estimated coefficients shown in the left panel in Figure 4 can be interpreted as follows: Companies that were only slightly affected by Covid-19 did not suffer any significant sales growth losses. By contrast, moderately affected companies recorded a significant 12.1% decrease in sales growth (annualized) compared to not or positively affected companies. Severely affected companies show a slightly higher sales growth loss of around 15%. In an extended specification we include additional controls for government policies as well as the epidemiological development measured by the number of people who died from Covid-19 in a country per month. Finally, we include country-industry-quarter-specific fixed effects. This does not only absorb all additional controls in the previous specification but also unobserved heterogeneity in policies and the development of the pandemic in each country. This leads to slightly smaller marginal effects. Slightly affected firms have 7.8% lower annualized sales growth than unaffected or positively affected companies and severely affected firms experienced 11.7% lower sales growth in this most stringent estimate.\nIn the estimates for stock returns (shown in the right panel in Figure 4), we see in the strictest estimation model (with full fixed effects) that even slightly affected companies show significantly lower stock returns of annualized 3% compared to companies that are not affected or are positively affected. As expected, moderately affected companies and severely affected companies show even stronger losses. They amount to 3.3% for moderately affected companies and 4.4% for severely affected companies.\nThe above discussion demonstrates that WAI accurately predicts a firm's sales growth and stock returns across all specifications. This confirms that WAI delivers timely, firm-level insights into exposure and its associated performance effects insights that go beyond what can be inferred from monitoring government policies or epidemiological trends alone. The indicator is also precise enough to distinguish the effects even in terms of the severity of affectedness. Our results thus align with previous studies showing that returns on assets or aggregate GDP growth deteriorated during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nAdditional robustness checks for different LLMs, time horizons, sectors and specifications"}, {"title": "", "content": "can be found in SI Appendix C.2. In SI Appendix C.2.1 we use an alternative LLM (ChatGPT) to compute WAIs and find that the estimates show a high degree of similarity. In SI Appendix C.2.2 we estimate the model for different time periods and find that the coefficients for the WAIs tend to be higher but less precisely measured when we consider a shorter sample period from 2018 to 2021, or from 2019 to 2020. In SI Appendix C.2.3 we estimate the model for the manufacturing and services sectors separately. We find that the estimated coefficients for sales growth are higher in the manufacturing sector than in the services sector. This result is consistent with the fact that the manufacturing sector is particularly vulnerable to supply chain shocks due to its reliance on complex, global supply chains and just-in-time inventory systems, and that supply chains being identified as the most significant issue mentioned by firms on their websites (see Figure 5). Finally, in SI Appendix C.2.4 we estimate a model that includes a one-period lag of the dependent variable to account for potential serial correlation. We find that our baseline estimates remain robust under this alternative specification.\nAfter having provided evidence for the validity of WAI we can now analyze its output more closely. First, we can use the LLM to assign tags indicating the type of problems firms were experiencing during the Covid-19 pandemic. These tags are shown in Figure 5 across countries. The three most prominent tags were related to supply chain issues followed by closure and hygiene measures (such as quarantine or social distance; see Methods). Moreover, up to 60% of the firms reported supply chain problems in the US, Canada and the UK. This resonates with results from recent surveys among small-to-medium sized businesses, but covers a much broader range of firms.\nSecond, we can analyze which sectors were affected the most from the Covid-19 pandemic. Figure 6 shows a ranking of the most affected sectors, based on the WAI share of severely affected firms by industry, where each firm is weighted by its number of employees. This measures can be interpreted as the share of employees working in severely affected firms in each industry. We find that the most affected sectors were 'Accommodation' (42%), followed by 'Arts, Entertainment and Recreation and Human Health' (40%), and 'Social Work Activities' (39%). The least affected sectors were 'Energy Utilities (19%), 'Wholesale Trade' (10%) and 'Construction' (7%). This is broadly in line with previous studies based on risk assessments of publicly listed firms in the US, but our analysis covers not only public but also private firms.\nThis paper presents a novel method for assessing the economic impact of social and economic shocks on firms using web-based data. By analyzing over five million company websites, we develop WAI and use it to measure the firm-level impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reliability of WAI is demonstrated through its strong correlation with pandemic containment measures and its ability to accurately capture the impact on business performance.\nUnlike traditional data collection methods, our web-based indicator is not only comprehensive and reliable but provides also real-time information, as many companies immediately report the impact of shocks on their websites to inform their customers or other relevant parties. Real-time information shortens the trial-and-error phase of"}, {"title": "", "content": "policy formulation, improving the accuracy of responses and safeguarding public budgets.\nA cross-country comparison suggests that WAI performs most effectively in countries with widespread internet usage and a predominantly English-speaking population, such as the US, Canada, the UK, and Ireland (cf. SI Appendix B.2). This limitation could be attributed to the fact that the LLMs employed in this study are primarily trained on English-language corpora, which may give them an advantage in these countries. However, with an increasing digitization across countries world-wide and improvements in multi-lingual LLMs we expect these differences to become less prominent over time, and thus making WAI an even more valuable tool in the future.\nThe findings of this study mark a significant advancement in real-time economic monitoring at the company level, offering valuable insights for policy-making. This capability is essential for enhancing the resilience of economies to future global shocks, whether they are health-related, technological, political, financial, or climate-driven (e.g., \u201cDisease X\u201d, tariffs, escalating trade wars, etc.)."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "We use multiple data sources and different methods to investigate whether and how companies were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. We use information from over five million company websites worldwide to determine whether the pandemic caused economic disruptions at the firm-level. To measure the impact of the pandemic on firm performance, we use sales information from S&P's Compustat North America and Global financials databases. Information on government interventions is taken from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT). In the following, we describe these datasets in more detail, demonstrate how we analyze company websites and what estimation techniques are used to relate the development of company performance to the Covid-19 exposure.\nWe use the Common Crawl dataset to access historical information from company websites. CommonCrawl is an extensive and constantly updated collection of web data that covers a large part of the web content and allows access to the historical content of a website. This makes it possible to follow the development of website content over time. Common Crawl is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and all its data is open source. The data is organized into crawl snapshots each containing around 30 million domains and 3 billion URLs. The crawls are done at a close-to-monthly frequency. For the period of concern, January 2020 to December 2022, the available crawls are listed in Extended Data Table 1.\nInformation about the crawling process, selection of seed URLs, crawling frequency, and politeness policies can be found on the CommonCrawl website. We built a tool to download"}, {"title": "", "content": "and process the historical website information. The tool is published open source on a GitHub website.\nWe start our analysis with a list of company website domains from Bureau Van Dijk's Orbis database, which is a comprehensive and widely used source of public and private company data. We restrict our selection to companies in the database with a website address, location information, and at least 5 employees. This yields 8,164,172 unique domains. Of these, 5,592,178 can be found in Common Crawl. A website not being indexed by Common Crawl can have multiple reasons, such as the website being unreachable/unmaintained, the administrator not allowing crawls of the website, or the website simply not being linked to any other part of the internet so that the crawler cannot find it. Note that domains that are part of a crawl in e.g. January are not always part of the next crawl in February. However, the domain overlap between crawls as measured by the Jaccard similarity shown in Extended Data Figure 7 - is high, indicating that we can follow the same firms over multiple observation periods. We also construct a measure for the content overlap of a firm's website between crawls. Common Crawl assigns unique so-called 'content digest' IDs to identify (exactly) duplicate captures of a website. For each firm, we calculate a 'content digest heartbeat', which is the share of crawls between which the content on the firm's website has changed. For instance, a value of 0.75 means that the content has changed between 18 out of the 24 total analyzed crawls. On average, firms change their website content often: the median firm has a heartbeat of 0.97 (the full distribution is shown in Extended Data Figure 8).\nFor each of the domains we have information for in Common Crawl, we download all subpages (such as apple.com/home, apple.com/newsroom) available, up to a total of 50. If there are more than 50 subpages available, we select the 50 shortest URLs these subpages will be higher up in the sitemap and therefore contain more generally relevant information. In addition, we select all URLs that contain one of the Covid-19 keywords in any language (such as aholddelhaize.com/covid-19). In most cases, we find relevant information on either subpages with keyword-containing URLs, the landing page, or a '/news' or similarly titled subpage. Therefore, we would not expect significant performance benefits from increasing the number of analyzed shortest subpages beyond 50. In the next step, we parse the HTML code of each website and extract paragraphs containing at least one of a list of Covid-related keywords, translated into 65 languages. The paragraphs are then processed using Llama 3.1, an open-source large language model (LLM) developed by Meta AI. At the time of this writing, the model is at the accuracy-efficiency frontier among open-source LLMs. To speed up processing, we use 8-bit floating point quantization which leads only to a minimal loss of quality. We use a custom logits processor that forces the model to return outputs in proper JSON format along with the following parameters: a temperature setting of 0 (because we want the model to choose the likeliest outputs in terms of affectedness and tags and not be creative), 64 maximum output tokens (which is more than sufficient to assign multiple tags if required), a fixed seed and stop characters '0' and '}', meaning the LLM will stop generating after either affectedness is detected as 0 or reaching the end of proper JSON output. We use the few-shot prompt shown in Extended Data Figure 9, in which we insert the Covid-mentioning paragraph as '<Input paragraph>'. The LLM returns a number between 0 and 3 indicating the severity of affectedness, as well as a list of tags indicating how the firm was affected. For most firms that do mention Covid, there are multiple text passages (often also from different subpages) that contain Covid keywords."}, {"title": "", "content": "The severity value for the firm for one time period is the maximum over all text passages mentioning Covid, and the tags are the union of tags assigned to all passages.\nIn the prompt we instructed the LLM to assign tags describing specific ways a firm was affected by Covid-19. We have summarized the tags identified by the LLM under the following umbrella terms: Supply chain issues, closure, remote work, hygiene measures, travel restrictions and financial impact. The individual tags proposed by the LLM that fall under these umbrella terms can be found in Extended Data Figure 10.\nOur study encompasses data from S&P's Compustat North America database, which includes 43,963 publicly listed US firms, and the Compustat Global database, covering 14,076 publicly listed non-US firms, for the years 2017 to 2022, using consolidated accounts. We conducted an in-depth analysis of quarterly financials, focusing on sales, number of employees, and total assets. To measure the financial performance across quarters, we calculated quarter-to-quarter growth rates after converting all financial levels to USD, utilizing currency exchange rates from Yahoo Finance. Additionally, we examined stock returns on the last day of each quarter, making adjustments for stock splits and applying the total return factor. For a comprehensive overview, we categorized the data by city, country, and industry, converting NAICS data to the NACE classification using established correspondence tables.\nInformation on policy interventions in response to the Covid-19 pandemic is obtained from the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT).\nWe collected historic websites for 42,644 out of 52,245 companies listed in Compustat North America and Global through Common Crawl, covering 81.6% of the companies. This aligns with"}, {"title": "", "content": "previous research findings on Common Crawl's representativeness.\nThe benchmark model used to analyze how our indicators track firm performance is expressed as:\n\n$$\\Delta \\log Y_{i,t} = \\alpha + \\delta_i + \\delta_t + Z_{i,t-1}\\theta + \\beta Covid\\_mention_{i,t}\n+ \\gamma_1 Mildly\\_affected_{i,t} + \\gamma_2Moderately\\_affected_{i,t}\n+ \\gamma_3Severely\\_affected_{i,t} + \\epsilon_{i,t}$$  \n\nwhere \\(Y_{i,t}\\) denotes either sales or stock price for firm i in quarter t.

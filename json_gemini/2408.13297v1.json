An inconsistency index can be considered more trustworthy when it satisfies a set of suitable properties. Therefore, the research community has been trying to postulate a set of desirable rules (axioms, properties) for inconsistency indices. Subsequently, many axiomatic frameworks for these functions have been suggested independently, however, the literature on the topic is fragmented and missing a broader framework.

Introduction", "content": "Pairwise comparisons are cornerstones and the most essential part of many multicriteria decision making methods such as the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) (Saaty, 1977, 1980, 2004), BWM (Best-Worst Method) (Rezaei, 2015), ELECTRE (\u00c9Limination Et Choix Traduisant la REalit\u00e9 i.e., Elimination and Choice Translating Reality) (Roy, 1968), MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) (Bana e Costa & Vansnick, 1994;\nBana e Costa et al., 2012), or PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations) (Vincke & Brans, 1985). Psychometricians had been performing pairwise comparisons for a very long period prior to the discovery of AHP, see e.g. the study of L. L. Thurstone entitled A Law of Comparative Judgement from 1927 (Thurstone, 2017). According to psychologists, it is more convenient and easier to make some solid opinions (comparisons) about only two alternatives than simultaneously about all the given alternatives. This led to the development of the theory of pairwise comparison called paired comparison in the field of psychology. These pairwise comparisons are mathematically represented by a positive pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). The ability of pairwise comparisons methods to break down large decision-making problems into manageable sub-problems is their fundamental strength. The decision-maker (DM) is empowered by these pairwise comparisons to recognize the flaws in his decisions, which enables DM to be more rational when making the final judgements. The consistency of the judgements can be mathematically identified by a real valued function named as inconsistency index.\nThere are two types of inconsistencies: ordinal inconsistency (weaker consistency condition) and cardinal inconsistency (stronger consistency condition). In ordinal pairwise comparisons, the only information that is provided is the relative preference between two objects without any numerical values. This means that if an object A is preferred to an object B, and the object B is preferred to an object C, then the object A should be preferred to the object C. This transitive property is essential for ensuring that the preferences are logically consistent and do not contain any contradictions. Moreover, if transitivity of preferences is violated, then it is not possible to (partially or totally) rank compared objects. Ordinal pairwise comparisons are often used in decision-making processes where numerical values cannot be assigned to objects, such as when evaluating subjective preferences or qualitative characteristics of objects.\nOrdinal inconsistency implies cardinal inconsistency; however, the converse is not true. It is possible to have cardinal inconsistency without ordinal inconsistency if the numerical values assigned to the objects do not reflect the underlying ordinal preferences accurately (Yang et al., 2016; Siraj et al., 2012). This article focuses solely on the developments of the axiomatic structures for cardinal inconsistency.\nConsistency issues in AHP are pivotal in the debate of the mathematical analysis of AHP. Saaty (1980) introduced two mathematical functions known as consistency index (CI) and consistency ratio (CR), which have been widely used by the decision makers to evaluate the inconsistency in the AHP.\nCriticism on the threshold of the CR index (Kuenz, 1993; Lane et al., 1989; Salo & H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, 1997); \u00c1goston & Csat\u00f3, 2022) has given a fertile ground to develop new inconsistency indices. Since then, tens of mathematical functions to evaluate inconsistency of judgements in PC methods have been developed independently and empirically (Brunelli, 2018; Pant et al. 2022), and researchers are still developing new indices to measure the inconsistency in PCM.\nHowever, there is still a room for discussion regarding the applicability of already created inconsistency indices. Perhaps, Saaty's seminal work \u201cA scaling method for priorities in hierarchical structures\" (Saaty, 1977) can be regarded as independent from other works on inconsistency indices. In literature, some of the inconsistency indices have been introduced which"}, {"title": "2. Multiplicative Pairwise Comparisons", "content": "In this section notation and important concepts of multiplicative pairwise comparisons are introduced.\nLet $n \\in N, n \\geq 2$ be the set of compared objects (usually alternatives, criteria, sub-criteria, etc.). Let $S$ be a multiplicative (ratio) scale. Then every $a_{ij} \\in S$ expresses how many times is an"}, {"title": "3. Axiomatization of consistency indices", "content": "Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) established three axioms for the local consistency of triads in a multiplicative PCM. They proposed the term \"triad\" to refer to any three elements from the abelian group R+ (under the usual multiplication operations) of positive real numbers a, b and c. A square matrix A = [aij] of order n is called a matrix over the group R+ if every element of the matrix belongs to the set R\u207a. Hence, every multiplicative PCM is a matrix over the group R+.\nDefinition 8 (Koczkodaj & Szwarc, 2014). Let (a, b, c) denote a triad from the space R+3, then according to a function f:R+3 \u2192 R can be regarded as inconsistency index if it meets the following three axioms:\n-Axiom 1: f maps a consistent triad $(a,b,c) \\in R+3$ to 0, i.e., f (a, b, c) = 0.\n-Axiom 2: There exists no inconsistency index which maps a triad (a,b,c) to 1, i.e., complete inconsistency can never be achieved, thus the codomain of the function f is [0,1[.\n-Axiom 3: If (a,b,c) is a consistent triad i.e. f (a, b, c) = 0 and if the values of a,b or c are altered, then the new triad (a', b', c') may no longer remain consistent, i.e., f(a, b, c) > 0. (Thus, a consistent triad becomes necessarily inconsistent when any of its values is altered).\nThe axioms from Definition 8 are specified for the local character of an inconsistency index. The first axiom results from the consistency requirement stated by Kendall & Smith (1940). Koczkodaj (1993) put forth the second Axiom for the first time in 1993. Further on, Koczkodaj et al. (2017) gave a number of reasons to choose the interval [0,1] instead of [0,\u221e[ as the range set of inconsistency indices. Naturally, normalization makes it easier to use the consistency index. Further on, Koczkodaj et al. (2020) argued that only real numbers should be used as a range of an inconsistency index.\nThis axiomatic structure was distinctive because no previous investigation on inconsistency indices had been conducted, but Brunelli (2016) raised some concerns about some of the shortcomings of these axioms. The negative aspects were as follows:\n1.  Axioms were primarily designed to be applied to a single triad, making them appropriate for a matrix of order 3 \u00d7 3. The PCM of an order larger than 3 was not explicitly covered by these axioms.\n2.  The third axiom did not take into account all instances of increasing/decreasing of values for a and c. Just two cases\u2014where either a or c are increasing or decreasing\u2014were used by Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014). The latter two scenarios\u2014where a increases while c decreases and a decreases while c increases\u2014were not investigated.\n3.  The three axioms' independence from one another was not established.\n\u201cIt is a reasonable expectation that the worsening of a triad, used in the definition of consistency, cannot make the entire matrix more consistent\", Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) said in support of the third axiom.\nBrunelli (2016) disputed this assumption and provided a refuting example. In that example, when one triad's consistency was worsened, the consistency of the other two triads was improved, which in turn also enhanced the matrix's consistency. A pairwise comparison matrix of order n \u00d7 n actually has any entry aij appear in (n \u2212 2 ) triads of the matrix. The consistency of the remaining (n - 1) triads won't always degrade if the consistency of one of the triads containing aij declines. In fact, Brunelli (2016) demonstrated in a counter example of a matrix of order 5 \u00d7 5 that when the consistency of one triad $(a_{12}, a_{15}, a_{25})$ containing $a_{15}$ was worsened, the consistency of all other triads $(a_{13}, a_{15}, a_{35})$ and $(a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{45})$ containing $a_{15}$ was strengthened.\nThere is no doubt that a set of positive reciprocal matrices does not constitute a vector space over the field R of real numbers. In this article, An(R+) denotes the set of all positive reciprocal matrices of order n, which is defined as follows.\nThus, an inconsistency index f is a function from the set An (R+) to the set of real numbers R. Brunelli (2016) re-structured the aforementioned axioms specifically for the pairwise comparison matrices [aij] = A \u2208 A3(R+) as follows:\nAxiom 1: For a consistent matrix A\u2208_A3(R+), f(A) = 0.\nAxiom 2: For an inconsistent matrix A\u2208_A3(R+), f(A) \u2208]0,1[.\nAxiom 3: The function f is a quasi-convex function of three variables a12, A13 and a23 and its absolute minimum occurs whenever a12. A23 = A13\u00b7\nThe next step in the construction of axioms was made by Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015). Five sound axioms were introduced as part of their axiomatic structure. Nevertheless, its initial publication, Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2011), contained the first four attributes. Instead of focusing on the inconsistency of a triad, these axioms were more concerned with the inconsistency of a matrix of any order. The following succinct summary of these five axioms proposed by Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015) is as follows:\nAxiom 1: Inconsistency index f must map all consistent PCM to a unique real number w. That is, A is consistent if and only if f (A) = \u03c9.\nTwo distinct consistent matrices must be mapped to the same real number w by an inconsistency index. Inconsistent matrices, on the other hand, must be mapped to set R\\{w}.\nThis axiom's mathematical meaning is similar to that of first axiom in (Koczkodaj & Szwarc, 2014). While in Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) the minimum normalized value of the inconsistency index \"0\" was taken as a representative of the consistent matrix, Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015) considered the minimum value of the function f to be the value corresponding to the consistent matrix.\nAxiom 2: The PCM's inconsistency assessment must be unaffected by the order in which the alternatives are assigned to its rows and columns. i.e.,"}, {"title": "4. Summary", "content": "In the previous section, four main axiomatic systems were introduced (see below). Therefore, a natural question arises: how similar are these systems?\nSimilarity of two sets can be evaluated via Jaccard index (Jaccard, 1912).\nDefinition 9. Let C and D be two (finite, non-empty) sets. Then the Jaccard index is given as follows:\n$J(C, D) = \\frac{|C \\cap D|}{|C \\cup D|}$\nIt is apparent from Definition 9 that 0 \u2264 J(C, D) \u2264 1. In particular, J(C, D) = 0 if the two sets have no intersection, while J(C, D) = 1 if the two sets are identical.\nThe four systems to be evaluated (in their original form) are as follows:\n- Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) (KS): 3 axioms.\nBrunelli & Fedrizzi (2015) (BF): 5 axioms.\nKoczkodaj & Urban (2018) (KU): 4 axioms.\nCsat\u00f3 (2019) (CS): 6 axioms.\nThe intersection in the numerator of (4) consists of axioms which are identical or almost identical in two given sets. The union in the denominator of (4) is just the sum of the number of axioms in both sets."}, {"title": "5. Conclusions and future research directions", "content": "In the last decade, a number of axiomatic frameworks have been developed to examine properties of inconsistency indices in (not only) multiplicative pairwise comparisons methods. The main theoretical frameworks include those by Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015), Csat\u00f3 (2018, 2019), Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) and Koczkodaj & Urban (2018). They share some similar features, but their main difference is that the latter three approaches are directly founded on the notion of cardinal consistency given by relation (2), which is based on triads (triples) of matrix elements. Therefore, since the cardinal consistency is defined via triads, maybe only triad-based inconsistency indices should be considered. Nevertheless, Table 1 lists the satisfaction of aforementioned properties for 18 inconsistency indices examined in the literature so far.\nThe aim of this paper was to provide a concise overview and discussion of the main developments in this narrow, albeit important area of operational research. Arguably, it was the study of Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015) that sparked the debate over the axiomatization of inconsistency indices' properties. After almost 10 years, the debate is still on, and it is impossible to judge which axiomatic system (or inconsistency index) is the most suitable. For example, Csat\u00f3 (2019) presented an example showing that the theoretical evaluations of the axiomatic framework provided by Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2017) is probably not the best one as it doesn't work well on for just three alternatives. Therefore, even when it comes to sets of triads, the axiomatic framework offered by Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2017) is not exhaustive, meaning that they allow for very strange inconsistency indices. Unlike the prior axiomatizations, Csat\u00f3 (2018, 2019) had a specific objective. The first, and as far as we are aware, only works in cases when a group of axioms or characteristics have been shown to specifically establish an inconsistency index. Csat\u00f3 (2019) writes on page 156:\n\u201cIt is worth to note that our approach is somewhat different from the previous ones in this topic, which aimed at finding a set of suitable properties to be satisfied by any reasonable inconsistency measure. Providing an axiomatic characterization implies neither we accept all properties involved as wholly justified and unquestionable nor we reject the axioms proposed by others. Therefore, the current paper does not argue against the application of other inconsistency indices. The sole implication of our result is that if one agrees with these\u2014rather theoretic\u2014axioms, then the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking remains the only choice.\u201d\nThus, Csat\u00f3 (2018, 2019), in particular, verified that the set of triads has just one plausible inconsistency index. All of the earlier axiomatizations permitted the use of additional, potentially incompatible inconsistency indices. This distinction appears to be very important. All of the axiomatizations above dealt with cardinal inconsistency; however, it is possible to establish a set of rules that address both cardinal and ordinal inconsistency in this area of study.\nThe inconsistency indices put forth so far cannot be accepted or rejected merely because they do not adhere to a particular axiomatic structure. Each axiomatic structure has some advantages and disadvantages. Developing an error-free axiomatic structure that can be applied to PCM of any order requires a sound mathematical analysis. For example; divergent opinions exist among researchers regarding the necessity of continuity in inconsistency indices. The need for continuity of a well-chosen inconsistency index should be carefully examined because there are discontinuous functions present in literature that serve as inconsistency indices.\nAs for the future research, we suggest the following directions:\ni) Properties of some inconsistency indices (see also Table 1) with respect to some axiomatic systems are unknown, hence filling this gap would be a valuable contribution. As can be seen, Table 1 includes 18 inconsistency indices, but Mazurek (2023) lists over 25 indices. Further on, while the properties of inconsistency indices are rather well examined with respect to axioms/properties from Brunelli & Fedrizzi (2015), satisfaction or violation of properties from Csat\u00f3 (2018, 2019), Koczkodaj & Szwarc (2014) or Koczkodaj & Urban (2018) is not so well established.\nii) Axioms (properties) discussed in this paper relate to pairwise comparisons in the multiplicative theoretical framework. Therefore, the set of axioms for additive or fuzzy preference relations theoretical frameworks can be postulated and discussed as well. Also, some indices might be generalized to the so called alo-groups (abelian linearly ordered groups), that is for all pairwise comparisons systems (multiplicative, additive and fuzzy) simultaneously, see e.g. Cavallo et al. (2023)."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Fault detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe and optimal operation of complex systems. Traditional model- based approaches, although widely explored, have some limitations in their ability to isolate all possible faults, especially those with evolving patterns as complete models are usually hard to obtain. Machine learning (ML) ap- proaches, on the other hand, are simpler and handle more effectively complex systems, however, their performance relies heavily on the data quantity and quality. Hybrid solutions seem to be promising although the choice of methods to integrate is challenging (Wilhelm et al., 2021). A hybrid method is thus developed for our case study, i.e., the problem of quench detection at the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL), where a fault detection method based on physical model residuals and data-driven clustering for fault isolation are combined.\n\nThe EuXFEL is the largest particle accelerator for X-ray laser generation worldwide. Along with the high-voltage power supplies, the klystrons and the waveguides, the superconducting radio-frequency cavities (SRFCs), are key components of the power transfer chain to the electron beam. The plant's linac comprises hundreds of 1.3 GHz TESLA-type cavities, controlled and monitored with the low level radio frequency (LLRF) system and operated in a pulsed mode with a pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz and at an average gradient of 23.6 MV/m (Reschke et al., 2017). This enables the three self-amplified spontaneous emission undulators to generate up to 27000 photon flashes every second. This setup is exploited by several hundred interdis- ciplinary users every year to carry out their experiments.\n\nEnhancing the availability, safety and reliability of the accelerator is therefore crucial to meet the demand, min- imize potential energy and financial losses and avoid the degradation of the facility. In this context, the behavior of the SRFCs is monitored through the LLRF system to detect and report the faulty events, especially quenches. These are severe faults that cause a loss of the super- conductivity of the SRFCs and thus an operation down- time. If a quench goes undetected, it has the potential to generate sufficient heat that can lead to disturbances in the helium flow of the cryogenic system and to an operation interruption that could last up to 24 hours.\n\nA quench detection system (QDS) has been deployed at the EuXFEL since its first commissioning in 2017 (Branlard et al., 2013). It relies on a statistical analysis of the pulses for indication of changes of the cavity quality factor $Q_L$, which is an indicating measure of the field coupling and the dissipating power in the SRFCs.

This is achieved through residuals that can be obtained with different methods. In our case, the nonlinear parity space method is used, and it is detailed here.\n\nBecause of its structure that is able to exhibit a resonant behavior at specific frequencies, a superconducting cavity is considered as a resonator. The parameters influencing the cavity's dynamics are the detuning $\u0394\u03c9(t)$ and the half bandwidth $\u03c9_{1/2}$ which represent, respectively, the difference between the driving frequency and the resonance frequency, and how sensitive a SRFC is towards the detuning. The cavity electromagnetic model as elaborated in (Schilcher, 1998) is given by\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} V_{P,I}(t) \\ V_{P,Q}(t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ V_{B,I}(t) \\ V_{B,Q}(t) \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\omega_{1/2} & -\u0394\u03c9(t)  \\\\ \u0394\u03c9(\u03c4) & -\\omega_{1/2} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} V_{P,I}(t) \\ V_{P,Q}(t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ V_{B,I}(t) \\ V_{B,Q}(t) \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} V_{F,I}(t) \\ V_{F,Q}(t) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\   \\ \\  \\ \\  \\  \\  \\  \\ \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\ \\ \\  \\  \\end{bmatrix}$ (1)\n\nwhere I and Q are the in-phase and quadrature compo- nents of the different signals. $V_F(t)$ is the forward field coupled into the cavity, $V_P(t)$ is the probe signal, i.e., the field generated inside the cavity, and $V_B(t)$ is the field induced by the beam.", "2.2 Residual generation": "The nonlinear parity space is an analytical redundancy method that aims at generating redundant expressions using the state-space model. Successive derivations of the model must be performed in order to retain only the known variables and obtain residuals. The residuals are then used as indicators of faults presence, a residual is non-zero in presence of faults, it is equal to zero otherwise. For the problem at hand, the cavity model has been exploited to derive the residual\n\n$r(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} -V_{P,I}(t) + \\omega_{1/2} [-V_{P,I}(t) + 2V_{F,I}(t) \u2013 V_{B,I}(t)] \\\\ \\\\ \\ V_{P,Q}(t) + \\omega_{1/2} [V_{P,Q}(t) - 2V_{F,Q}(t) + V_{B,Q}(t)] \\end{bmatrix}$,\n\nthat is based on the analytical redundancy of (1) with respect to the detuning. More details regarding the choice of the residual can be found in (Nawaz et al., 2018).", "2.3 Residual assessment": "In order to automate the residual analysis for presence of faults, the log-likelihood ratio is used with the as- sumption that the residual follows a Gaussian distribution $N(\u03bc, \u03c3)$ with a mean of zero under nominal conditions, i.e., $\u03bc = 0$, representing the null hypothesis. While with fault occurrence, the residual is expected to exhibit a Gaussian distribution with a mean different from zero, i.e, $\u03bc \u2260 0$, representing the non-null hypothesis. Unlike the variance, the mean is unknown and needs to be estimated, the generalized likelihood ratio is therefore applied,\n\n$\u039b_{GLR}(k) = \\frac{K}{2} ln (\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=k-K+1}^{i=k} r(i))^T  \u03c3^{-1} (\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=k-K+1}^{i=k} r(i))$ (6)\n\nwhere r(i) is the evaluated and discretized residual, K is the size of the moving evaluation window and $\u03c3^2$ is the variance of the nominal residual. The result follows a $\u03c7^2$ distribution, which gives, with a desired false alarm rate, directly the corresponding threshold on rating events as anomalous (Eichler et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "3. CLUSTERING-BASED QUENCH ISOLATION", "content": "The statistical test helps to detect faults, it is however unable to identify their types. Data-driven methods help to address this issue. The goal in our case is to isolate"}, {"title": "3.1 Quench clustering models", "content": "The k-medoid method is briefly summarized in the fol- lowing. Given $X = {X_1,X_2,...,X_n}$, with $x_i \u2208 R^d$, a dataset of n observations with dimension d. The k-medoids is a clustering algorithm that aims to partition X into k clusters $C = {C_1, C_2,...,C_k}$ by iteratively assigning every observation to a cluster medoid $M = {m_1, m_2,..., m_k}$, here, a medoid is a representative observation, i.e., $M \u2282 X$. In the same cluster, observations show high degree of similarity S(x1, x2), while they are as dissimilar as possible in different clusters. The clustering can be achieved with different partitioning algorithms. The main input param- eters are the number of clusters k, the similarity measure S and the maximum number of iterations.\n\nTwo models are built in our case, based on two different similarity measures. As base measure, the EUC is used,\n\n$EUC(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i \u2013 x_i^2)^2 }$.\n\nGiven the GLR traces of normalized quench pulses that exhibit variability, characterized primarily by stretches and shifts in time, as shown in Fig. 1, the DTW (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978)\n\n$DTW(x_1, x_2) = arg min \\sum dist(x_1, x_2)$,\n\nis also explored, where $i,j \u2208 {1,2,...,d}$ are sample indices of the observations $x_1$ and $x_2$. Any distance (dist) can be employed for DTW, here, the Euclidean is used.\n\nThe difference between the two, as can be seen from the previous equations and from the illustrative example in Fig. 1, consists mainly in what the measures are trying to capture. While the EUC computes the similarity as the sum of the distances between each sample from observation $x_1$ and its time-corresponding sample in observation $x_2$, DTW is the sum of distances from the optimal time- warping path, i.e., the one assigning samples of observation $x_1$ to the closest samples in observation $x_2$. DTW tries therefore to capture the shape similarity in addition to the distance. And the quench traces in Fig. 1 are thus"}, {"title": "3.2 Inference", "content": "Given a new faulty trace $g \u2208 R^d$, in order to make decision whether it is a quench or not, its distance to the quench medoids is computed to assess its similarity with the quench clustering model. For both similarity measures, we define a set, based on the distances to the medoids, within which a trace is labeled as a quench. To estimate the sets, we set lower and/or upper thresholds on the distance to the quench medoids, in addition to decision boundaries H. To estimate H, a validation dataset N, with a total of 407 non-quench faulty traces, is used.\n\nEUC-based inference: Fig. 3 depicts the distance space (distance from the medoids), obtained with EUC, of the two quench clusters from X and the validation data N. As can be seen, the two quench clusters are not distinct and present a semi-elliptical shape. In order to separate the quenches from the other faults, and given the shape of the quench distances, in addition to the thresholds, two"}, {"title": "4. EVALUATION", "content": "The EuXFEL linac is organized into 25 stations, each comprising 4 cryomodules. Within each cryomodule, there are 8 cavities, resulting in a total of 32 SRFCs per station. The data from the SRFCs consist of the forward and probe signals that correspond to the radio frequency pulses, where each pulse lasts for 1.82 ms and is sampled at 1 MHz (i.e., 1819 samples). The data are captured by a snapshot recorder and saved in files in the hdf5 format. The snapshots are triggered by different protection systems, such as, klystrons, modulators, couplers, quadrupoles and cryogenics, but also the quench detection system and/or the finite state machine. Each file, identified by a unique timestamp, corresponds to a specific faulty event from an individual station, and gathers the sampled signals for 250 consecutive pulses in all the cavities of the station. Results of the residual-based detection, i.e., the GLR traces, are also saved to the same file. The ground truth for the specific faults, however, is not available. For this study, data from the first half and second half of 2022, corresponding to a total of 671 station-related snapshots, have been collected and annotated in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.\n\nWe compare the proposed solution to the currently de- ployed QDS that relies on a statistical analysis of the quality factor $Q_L$ of the cavities. The $Q_L$ is computed for almost every pulse and compared to a running average"}, {"title": "4.3 Results", "content": "Results of the residual-based fault detection have shown that given the total number of 671 events, 354 were detected as faults within the SRFCs, some of them are documented in (Eichler et al., 2023). After annotation, 87 events were found corresponding to quenches. The highest number was recorded in April with a total of 21 quenches. This is because the facility was running at high energies, i.e., most cavities were operated just below the quench gradient. More detailed evaluation of the residual- based fault detection, and examples of the events that triggered alarms with the GLR, can be found in previous publications (Nawaz et al., 2018; Eichler et al., 2023).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the current residual implemen- tation does not include the voltage induced by the beam VB, as additional input, as shown in (1), but its effect is compensated as presented in (Eichler et al., 2023). This becomes problematic in certain rare cases where inaccurate inferences may be triggered due to transitions of the beam turning on and off or changes in its pattern occurring within the 250 pulses captured in the snapshots. First tests where the bunch charge measurements from the toroids are added as an additional input have therefore been carried out, this will be automated and evaluated in the future."}, {"title": "5. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, a hybrid method to detect quenches at the EuXFEL is presented. It is a two-stage method in which the first stage generates and evaluates residuals with the nonlinear parity space method and the generalized likelihood ratio, respectively, in order to detect faults. The quenches are subsequently distinguished from the other faults in the second stage through two different clustering models, based on the EUC and DTW similarity measures. The proposed solution has been implemented and evalu- ated on recent data, the obtained results depict its high performance compared to the currently deployed detection system. In the near future, the beam information will be included to the implementation of the residual generation, this will help to eliminate some false alarms. The current deployment of the proposed solution is however offline, an implementation on dedicated server and on a FPGA for an online deployment has therefore been initiated. We also aim to develop and compare other detection methods and implement a human-in-the-loop procedure, in which, all methods will be deployed, and in case of disagreement, an expert intervention will be initiated. Subsequently, with the new information, there will be an automatic retraining or adjustment of the inference strategy, in order to enhance both the detection and the identification."}]}

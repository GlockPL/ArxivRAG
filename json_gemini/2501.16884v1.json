{"title": "Irony Detection, Reasoning and Understanding in Zero-shot Learning", "authors": ["Peiling Yi", "Yuhan Xia"], "abstract": "Irony is a powerful figurative language (FL) on social media that can potentially mislead various NLP tasks, such as recommendation systems, misinformation checks, and sentiment analysis. Understanding the implicit meaning of this kind of subtle language is an essential step to mitigate the negative impact of irony in NLP tasks. However, building models to understand irony presents a unique set of challenges, because irony is a complex form of language that often relies on context, tone, and subtle cues to convey meaning that is opposite or different from the literal interpretation. Large language models, such as ChatGPT, are increasingly able to capture implicit and contextual information. In this study, we investigate the generalization, reasoning and understanding ability of ChatGPT on irony detection across six different genre irony detection datasets. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT appears to show an enhanced language understanding and reasoning ability. But it needs to be very careful in prompt engineering design. Thus, we propose a prompt engineering design framework IDADP to achieve higher irony detection accuracy, improved understanding of irony, and more effective explanations compared to other state-of-the-art ChatGPT zero-shot approaches. And ascertain via experiments that the practice generated under the framework is likely to be the promised solution to resolve the generalization issues of LLMs.\n\nImpact Statement\u2014The generalization of irony detection faces significant challenges that lead to substantial performance deviations when detection models are applied to diverse real-world scenarios. In the study, we find that domain-specific prompts, as generated from our IDADP framework for ChatGPT, can not only overcome dataset-specific limitations but also generate coherent, human-readable reasoning, transforming ironic text into its intended meaning. Based on our findings and in-depth analysis, we identify several promising directions for future research aimed at enhancing ChatGPT's zero-shot capabilities in irony detection, reasoning, and comprehension. These include advancing contextual awareness in irony detection, exploring hybrid symbolic-neural methods, and integrating multimodal data, among others.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "IRONY is a rhetorical device or figure of speech [1], [2], which provides a comprehensive overview of irony: the expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect. Irony on social media often takes the form of verbal irony and situational irony. Verbal Irony occurs when someone says something but means the opposite. Situational Irony occurs when the actual outcome of a situation differs from what was expected [3]. Irony often relies on the broader context, such as Posters' personalities, cultural references, or the situation they are commenting on. The sneaky and subtle nature of irony poses a significant challenge for other NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, misinformation detection, and machine translation. All these tasks need models to understand the true intent behind the text.\n\nIrony detection involves creating algorithms to identify and interpret irony in the text by recognizing linguistic cues like word choice, sentence structure, and context [4]. Effective irony detection accurately classifies ironic statements while explaining these classifications, enhancing system transparency [5]. It should also be adaptable across platforms and content types.\n\nIrony detection is an active domain in NLP. However, existing research has at least three limitations: 1) Generalization: Many irony detection models are trained on relatively small or domain-specific datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across different contexts and cultures. Models may perform well on specific datasets but fail to detect irony in diverse real-world scenarios. This limitation hinders the development of models that can generalize effectively [6]. 2) Reasoning: Detecting irony often requires common-sense reasoning and an understanding of real-world knowledge, such as knowing that certain situations are undesirable or that certain statements are typically exaggerated for effect. Current models refer to the difficulty in understanding how these models arrive at their decisions. This issue is especially pronounced in complex models such as deep neural networks and large-scale transformer-based pre-trained models [7]. 3) Understanding: Current models primarily focus on classifying irony as binary yes or no question, but often fail to capture and generate its true semantic and affective meaning. This ability is crucial for effectively addressing other NLP tasks that rely on recognizing and interpreting irony. Ironic text understanding often relies heavily on context, including prior conversation, cultural references, and situational factors. Current models, including those based on pre-trained transformers, often struggle to incorporate the necessary context to understand irony accurately [8], [9]. These limitations hinder the model's ability to detect various forms of irony.\n\nThis study aims to address existing limitations by utilizing ChatGPT's zero-shot capabilities to detect irony across diverse datasets and platforms, without prior training on ironic samples, while also generating human-like reasoning. ChatGPT has demonstrated a notable advancement in its ability to understand contextual cues and detect emotional nuances [10], [11], which are critical for identifying irony. The accurate interpretation of irony often hinges on the model's capacity to discern both the literal and implicit meanings of a statement, alongside its comprehension of the broader context, including"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "A. Irony detection\n\nIrony detection requires sophisticated methods to handle the subtlety of figurative language, with related works falling into five categories:\n\n1) Rule-based: This approach relies on predefined rules and patterns to identify ironic statements. (e.g. [18]) provide two approaches to detect irony in Twitter's text data. The first is a lexicon generation algorithm to determine the polarity sentiment, and the second detects irony based on interjection words. (e.g. [19]) detect sarcastic tweets containing positive sentiment followed by an undesirable state. While effective for certain irony types, these methods struggle with scalability and diverse text\u2014addressing this is the focus of this study.\n\n2) Lexicon-based: This method uses lexical cues and semantic patterns linked to ironic language. (e.g. [20], [21]) compare sarcastic Twitter utterances to non-sarcastic positive or negative ones. [22] explore the impact of sentiment and irony in hashtags and develop a hashtag tokeniser. A key advantage is the explainability of decisions, crucial for certain tasks. However, multiple meanings of words and scalability issues can limit this approach in large-scale applications. This study aims to maintain transparency and explainability while improving scalability.\n\n3) Feature-based approaches: Machine learning models for irony detection rely on linguistic features and classifiers, with their effectiveness depending on feature selection. For instance, N-grams [23] identify recurring patterns or words indicative of irony, while part-of-speech tags [24] capture unusual sentence constructions. Sentiment analysis and semantic roles [25] help detect contradictions in meaning, and conversation history [26] offers clues based on broader interaction context. [27] integrate these features effectively, allowing traditional models to capture intricate word-context relationships. However, these models often require complex architectures and expertise in feature selection [28]. While foundational, traditional methods are now often supplemented or replaced by deep learning techniques for more automatic text representation learning.\n\n4) Deep learning-based approaches: Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning models learn hierarchical representations from raw text, capturing complex patterns without manual feature engineering. These models use dense vector embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to capture language nuances. Neural architectures like RNNs [29], CNNs [30], and Bidirectional LSTMs [27], [31] integrate these embeddings, with attention mechanisms focusing on relevant input for better irony detection in longer texts. Recent work explores transformer-based or hybrid models [5], [32]. However, complex models like transformers can be less interpretable, complicating explanations of their decision-making.\n\n5) Large Language Modeling approach: Studies on using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for irony detection have begun to emerge, often under zero-shot or few-shot paradigms with prompt engineering, yielding mixed results. Research [33], [34] suggests that while ChatGPT shows promise in other fields, it is not yet the best tool for irony detection compared to specialized models. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have specifically focused on zero-shot irony detection, inference, and understanding.\n\nB. Prompt engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. The quality of the outputs generated by an LLM is directly related to the quality of the prompts [35]. The basis of prompt engineering is rooted in developing LLMs like the GPT series [36], [37], [11]. Research on the GPT series has been carried out to examine how various prompt structures affect model outputs, including the impact of length, specificity, and formatting on the quality of responses. Recent studies have focused specifically on the design optimization of prompts.\n\n1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting: CoT introduced by [13], improves reasoning by breaking tasks into intermediate steps. It can be combined with few-shot prompting for better performance on complex tasks. [38] extended this, showing that LLMs can act as zero-shot reasoners by adding \"Let's think step by step\" to prompts. Self-consistency [39] enhances reliability by generating multiple reasoning paths, and selecting the most consistent answer. To reduce manual effort in crafting demonstrations, [40] proposed sampling diverse questions and generating reasoning chains. These methods inspired the design of our framework.\n\n2) Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting: ToT generalizes CoT prompting by encouraging the exploration of intermediate steps for problem-solving with language models. ToT requires defining the number of candidates and thoughts/steps for each task [41]. Similarly, [42] uses reinforcement learning instead of beam search for decision-making. [43] simplifies the approach by getting LLMs to evaluate intermediate thoughts in a single prompt. Though mainly used for arithmetic problems, we adopt the core idea: of promoting correct partial solutions, eliminating implausible ones using commonsense, and retaining \"maybe\" solutions in our framework design.\n\n3) Generated Knowledge Prompting: This approach involves generating knowledge from a language model and using it as additional input when answering questions. [44] provides a representative example, consisting of two stages: first, generating question-related knowledge statements by prompting a language model, and second, integrating that knowledge to make predictions, selecting the highest-confidence response. Our framework incorporates a similar approach.\n\n4) Automatic prompt generation: This approach focuses on automatically generating prompts to guide LLMs such as ChatGPT, rather than manually crafting them, which can be time-intensive. PROmpting (OPRO) [45] uses LLMs as optimizers, generating new solutions iteratively. Similarly, Promptbreeder [46] evolves task-prompts via an evolutionary algorithm, while APE [47] treats prompts as \"programs\u201d optimized by searching instruction candidates. [48] trains models to rewrite under-optimized prompts. However, our experiments show that fully automated prompts are less effective for domain-specific tasks.\n\nC. Zero-shot learning in LLMS\n\nLLMs can generalize knowledge across domains and handle tasks without specific training or fine-tuning, using \"zero-shot\" prompts without examples. While this is impressive, zero-shot performance is often less accurate or reliable than fine-tuned models trained for specific tasks, leading to less precise responses. For example, [11] have performed few-shot learning remarkably well on GPT-3. However, zero-shot performance is much worse than the few-shot performance on tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, and natural language inference. One potential reason is that, without few-shot exemplars, it is harder for models to perform well on prompts that are not similar to the format of the pretraining data. Designing prompts that guide the model to produce better zero-shot results is a practical approach. This includes using clear and explicit instructions that reduce ambiguity. To address the issue, [38] demonstrates that LLMs are decent zero-shot reasoners by simply adding \"Let's think step by step\". [49] simply replace \"Let's think step by step\" of Zeroshot-CoT with \"Let's first understand the problem and devise a plan to solve the problem. Then, let's carry out the plan and solve the problem step by step\" to further improve model zero-shot learning capability. FLAN (Fine-tuned Language Net) [50] shows that instruction fine-tuning LLMs on a collection of datasets described via instructions\u2014substantially improves"}, {"title": "III. DATASETS AND CHALLENGES", "content": "A. Datasets selection\n\nWhen selecting irony detection datasets, we focus on several criteria to ensure suitability for training and evaluation, helping our models generalize across various irony types and contexts. 1) Diversity of Irony Types: Capturing multiple irony types allows models to generalize across contexts. 2) Source Diversity: Drawing from varied sources, platforms, or domains enhances model adaptability. 3) Annotation Quality: Since irony is context-dependent and subtle, datasets should document annotation methods to ensure labels reflect true content. 4) Public Availability and Documentation: Publicly available, well-documented datasets ensure reproducibility and consistency in research. Based on these criteria, six irony detection corpora were selected (Table I).\n\nB. Datasets description\n\nAmong our selected datasets, iSarcasm [8] focuses on detecting intended sarcasm by minimizing labelling noise and capturing authors' true meanings, which may differ from readers' interpretations. Contributors provide links to sarcastic and non-sarcastic tweets, implicitly labelling their texts. Trained annotators then categorize each English text by irony type, ensuring labels accurately reflect authors' intentions. SemEval-2018 [9] explores irony's effect on sentiment classification, building on challenges identified in SemEval-2014. A dataset of 3,000 tweets, gathered via irony-related hashtags, was manually labeled by linguistics students, with each tweet receiving a binary irony label and inter-annotator agreement checks to ensure consistency. Gen & RQ & HYP [52] stem from the same research and focus on different irony types. The \"Gen\" dataset captures broad sarcasm instances across contexts, \"RQ\" highlights rhetorical questions that convey sarcasm without expecting answers, and \"HYP\" focuses on exaggerated statements used ironically. Each dataset, sourced from the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC 2.0), supports detailed irony analysis across diverse rhetorical forms. Finally, Reddit [53] dataset was collected from the online platform Reddit, where three undergraduates independently annotated each sentence with binary irony labels. This dataset reveals that context is essential for accurate irony assessment, as a sentence's meaning can vary between ironic and non-ironic based on contextual cues.\n\nC. Challenges\n\nTo effectively investigate the challenges inherent in this study, it is essential to first evaluate the diversity and representativeness of our datasets. Prior research [6] underscores the importance of cross-dataset comparisons in assessing the generalizability of irony detection models that have been fine-tuned on specific datasets. These investigations have revealed that a significant number of models struggle to generalize their performance across different datasets, suggesting that no single dataset can comprehensively capture the diverse expressions of sarcasm found in varying styles, contexts, and domains. This limitation raises critical questions regarding the efficacy of sarcasm detection models trained on narrowly defined datasets. Consequently, we aim to conduct analogous preliminary experiments to further explore this issue.\n\nWe set up the experiments using 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing, applying the default settings on three widely used pre-trained models for classification task and irony detection: BERT [54], ROBERTa [55], and MPNet [56]. Table II illustrates that models trained on out-of-domain datasets face significant challenges in generalizing effectively. It is important to highlight that the tests conducted on the generic sarcasm (Gen), rhetorical question (RQ) and hyperbole (HYP) datasets yielded better results. However, it is essential to acknowledge that, despite these three datasets containing different types of irony and varying logistical patterns, they were all sourced from the same platform and annotated by the same group of annotators. This observation suggests that, in addition to the inherent differences in irony types, the distinct nature of social media interactions and the varying methodologies of annotation may serve as significant barriers to model generalization.\n\nWhile these models have at least been trained on the same task, our approach intends to examine their performance in a zero-shot context, where the models are not trained on any samples or tasks related to irony detection. This presents an additional layer of complexity and challenge, as we seek to understand how well these models can perform in the absence of prior exposure to irony-laden examples."}, {"title": "IV. METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this section, we start by defining the research problem, followed by an overview of the overall framework of our model. Next, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method, concluding with an outline of the application process."}, {"title": "A. Problem definition", "content": "The key notations used throughout the article, as outlined in Table III, followed by a formalization of the research problems from multiple perspectives.\n\nIrony detection: Irony detection, in computational terms, is the process of the model automatically identifying and understanding instances of irony in written or spoken language [57]. Irony detection in the study can be formulated as a classification problem:\n\n$C(T) \\in {I, N}$\n\nThe goal of the model is to accurately classify T based on its understanding of irony.\n\nGeneralization: The generalization of a model refers to its ability to perform well on new, unseen data that was not included in the training set[58]. The generalization of a model can be expressed as:\n\n$G(T) = D_{test} [f^{\\theta} (T)] \u2013 E(T)$\n\nThis study focuses on the model's ability to handle tasks or generate responses for queries it hasn't been explicitly trained on. Instead of relying on specific examples for each task, the model draws on its understanding of language, context, and general knowledge to infer appropriate responses from the input.\n\nReasoning: Reasoning refers to the model's ability to process information, draw inferences, and provide conclusions or answers based on the given input [59].\n\n$R(T) = F(P(I,T))$\n\nThe reasoning process is successful if the model generates a logically sound conclusion and a human-readable and understanding reason.\n\nUnderstanding: Understanding in irony detection refers to the model's ability to recognize and interpret statements whose intended meaning is different or opposite from the literal meaning [60].\n\n$M^{2} \\neq M^{l}$\n\nThe results of this research indicate that it is possible to generate sentences that do not contain irony but retain the same intended meaning. The model's understanding can be described as:\n\n$U(T) = M^{2}$ and $U(T) \\notin I_{n}$"}, {"title": "B. Theory analysis", "content": "In-Context Learning, introduced by [11], allows a language model to perform tasks by simply providing limited examples or instructions in the prompt, without updating its internal parameters. Instead of fine-tuning the model on a large dataset for a specific task, in-context learning develops a broad range of skills and pattern recognition abilities during unsupervised pre-training, enabling it to quickly adapt to or recognize the task at inference time. However, the performance of in-context learning is: 1) Highly sensitive to the quality and format of the prompt. Even minor adjustments in wording or the order of examples can result in significant performance variations. For instance, a prompt that is structured to highlight the contrast between literal and intended meanings can enhance the model's ability to detect irony effectively. Conversely, vague or poorly framed prompts may confuse the model, leading to misclassification. 2) Less reliable for complex tasks such as irony detection, which require deep domain-specific knowledge. This is particularly true for understanding various forms of irony that the model may not have encountered during its pre-training phase. 3) Inherently variable is the nature of GPT models, which involves predicting the next word based on probabilities. This randomness can result in fluctuations in the generated text, which presents additional challenges for irony detection and reasoning.\n\nAfter a theoretical analysis, we show how these insights support our approach, yielding significantly improved results over state-of-the-art models and addressing issues from preliminary experiments."}, {"title": "C. Overall Framework", "content": "The overarching structure of the proposed IDADP model is depicted in Figure 2. In our framework, we use GPT to apply domain-specific knowledge. Using prompt engineering, we determine the optimal pattern and employ a voting mechanism to aggregate all results, generating the final output.\n\n1) Domain Knowledge Extraction: This phase aims to design the questions to make ChatGPT-generated domain knowledge to be used as part of the prompt. These domain questions all are generated by certain patterns guided by [35]. These patterns describe effective techniques for accomplishing different interaction objectives.\n\nThe Flipped Interaction Pattern: The pattern drives the model to start the conversation to get more accurate information from the user. For example, I would like you to ask me questions to identify irony correctly.\n\nThe Persona Pattern: The pattern enables the users to express what they need help with without knowing the exact details of the output they need. For example, Act as an annotator to label irony datasets.\n\nThe Question Refinement Pattern: If a user asks a question, they may not be an expert in the domain and might struggle to phrase it optimally or include helpful details. The model may state limitations in its answer or request additional information to provide a more accurate response. For example, I will ask your help to identify irony in a statement. My question is \"Is there irony in the statement?\u201d suggests a better version of the question to use.\n\nThe Recipe Pattern: The recipe pattern is that a user may not always have a well-specified description of what they would like to implement, construct, or design. For example, Provide a complete sequence of steps to identify an irony in a statement.\n\nWe utilized these prompt patterns to generate serial questions to acquire a collection of domain-general knowledge. This knowledge will be abstracted at the next phase as context cues to help machines do zero-shot learning.\n\n2) Domain Knowledge Integration: This phase involves integrating all domain knowledge from Phase 1 into general contextual cues for the model. It is essential to be specific about the instructions and tasks we want the model to perform; the more descriptive and detailed the prompt, the better the outcomes. Furthermore, the details included should be relevant and contribute meaningfully to the task at hand. Drawing inspiration from the nuanced nature of irony and the annotation methods used for irony datasets, we need to integrate three types of knowledge.\n\nSimple but specific definition of irony with one sentence: The first type aims to elicit quick, intuitive, or pattern-recognition-based answers from ChatGPT, focusing on straightforward and specific definitions of irony. For example, irony expresses the opposite of its literal meaning or contrast with the context.\n\nDomain specificity features: The type prompt emphasizes the importance of features in the understanding of ironic statements. For example, discrepancy: between what is said and what is meant. and contrast: between expectation and reality presented in the statement. are the main features. They mentioned in past irony detection papers used as feature engineering.\n\nThe process of irony detection: This type of knowledge is specifically related to the irony detection process. For example, begin by asking ChatGPT to assess whether a statement is ironic, using a prompt such as \"Is the following statement"}, {"title": "V. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "This section conducts a quantitative evaluation to assess the effectiveness of IDADP, complemented by qualitative experiments to provide a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind IDADP's consistent results.\n\nA. Experiments design\n\nTo assess the reliability and consistency of ChatGPT's understanding of irony, we will design our experiments from four key perspectives:\n\n1) Generalization: We conducted experiments using six different irony detection test datasets in a zero-shot learning setting to determine if irony is present in each statement. This will evaluate the model's ability to generalize its understanding of irony across diverse datasets without prior exposure to any specific training data.\n\n2) Reasoning: In this task, the reasoning process is deemed successful if the model generates a logically sound conclusion along with a human-readable and understandable explanation. For a response to be considered adequate, it must demonstrate coherence, accurately follow from the premises, and align with established logical principles. Additionally, the explanation should not only justify the conclusion but also be clear and concise, allowing users to easily follow the thought process behind the model's reasoning. We evaluate the clarity and accessibility of the explanations by using the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests, which measure how easily a human can comprehend the text. This ensures that the explanations are not overly complex or difficult to interpret, making them suitable for a broad audience. The results are further analyzed manually to assess whether there is a balance between logical accuracy and ease of comprehension, ensuring that the reasoning process remains both robust and user-friendly.\n\n3) Understanding: iSarcasmEval is the first shared dataset that includes pairs of sarcastic texts and their non-sarcastic rephrasings-two texts conveying the same meaning but with one using sarcasm and the other expressing the message directly. This unique structure allows for a more nuanced evaluation of sarcasm detection and understanding. Unlike the original pairwise detection task, where the goal is to classify sarcasm, we designed a more complex generation test to evaluate ChatGPT's comprehension ability. Specifically, we tasked ChatGPT with reversing 200 ironic or sarcastic texts into their non-ironic counterparts, requiring the model to not only recognize the sarcastic intent but also accurately rephrase it into a neutral, direct form that retains the core meaning. To assess the model's performance, we compared the generated non-ironic texts with those provided by the original authors, focusing on semantic equivalence and how well the sarcastic undertones were removed without altering the meaning\n\nB. Settings\n\nIn this study, we employed the GPT-3.5-turbo model, a variant within the GPT-3.5 family, chosen for its decent performance in generating high-quality text and its large user base."}, {"title": "VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "content": "Irony detection is a complex linguistic task that involves recognizing when the intended meaning of a statement differs from its literal interpretation, especially in zero-shot learning scenarios where models lack pre-training on ironic examples. Our research leverages ChatGPT's zero-shot capabilities to detect irony across various social media platforms without relying on existing datasets. We introduce the IDADP framework, enhancing interactions through effective prompt engineering, improved context awareness, and features that address irony contradictions. Our refined evaluation framework incorporates linguistic and contextual analysis, boosting the model's accuracy. We also explore ChatGPT's decision-making process, increasing transparency and trust in its outputs. We will discuss key observations, how our findings address identified limitations, and the ongoing challenges ChatGPT faces in generalization, reasoning, and understanding irony detection.\n\nGeneralization: To address generalization challenges, we leveraged ChatGPT's zero-shot learning and prompt engineering to enhance adaptability to new data, reducing overfitting. Domain-specific prompts improved handling of linguistic complexities, though misclassification persists due to three main issues: First, the model struggles with nuanced meanings due to contextual and linguistic complexity. Second, model calibration remains a limitation, particularly in recognizing subtle cues like irony. Lastly, the model's accuracy could benefit from exposure to a broader range of linguistic patterns, especially those involving irony, sarcasm, and social commentary.\n\nReasoning: In our experiments, we found that integrating prompt engineering with multi-step reasoning processes and domain-specific knowledge significantly enhanced ChatGPT's ability to generate coherent, human-readable reasoning. However, there was a significant difference in performance when the model encountered unfamiliar contexts, highlighting the importance of providing rich contextual information to enhance the model's focus.\n\nUnderstanding: We analysed ChatGPT's capability to convert 200 ironic texts into their non-ironic equivalents, and we found that the model demonstrated a notable proficiency in recognizing irony. It was able to retain the intended message by relying on literal interpretations. However, this approach is limited in scenarios where explicit markers or contextual clues are absent. While the task underscored ChatGPT's ability to disentangle complex linguistic features, it simultaneously revealed its limitations in comprehensively grasping irony without clear indicators.\n\nFuture directions: Enhancing ChatGPT's zero-shot capabilities for irony detection, reasoning, and comprehension offers promising research paths. Key areas include improving contextual awareness for irony detection, as it relies on subtle, conversation-embedded cues; context-aware attention mechanisms or expanded context windows could help capture these nuances. Hybrid symbolic-neural methods may support complex reasoning by combining logical structuring with neural flexibility. Addressing implicit knowledge gaps is also crucial, as irony often requires shared cultural understanding; multi-task transfer learning across satire, hypothetical reasoning, and idiom-related tasks could strengthen this. Finally, integrating multi-modal data may enhance irony detection by incorporating tone and body language, paving the way for a more contextually nuanced ChatGPT."}]}

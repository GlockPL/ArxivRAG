This paper introduces Metaphor-Fluid Design, a novel approach that dynamically adjusts metaphorical representations based on conversational use-contexts. We compare this approach to a Default VUI, which characterizes the present implementation of commercial VUIs commonly designed around the persona of an assistant, offering a uniform interaction style across contexts. In Study 1 (N=130), metaphors were mapped to four key use-contexts-commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery-along the dimensions of formality and hierarchy, revealing distinct preferences for task-specific metaphorical designs. Study 2 (N=91) evaluates a Metaphor-Fluid VUI against a Default VUI, showing that the Metaphor-Fluid VUI enhances perceived intention to adopt, enjoyment, and likability by aligning better with user expectations for different contexts. However, individual differences in metaphor preferences highlight the need for personalization.

As these systems proliferate, the ways in which users engage with and conceptualize them evolve dynamically. However, contemporary VUI design remains largely constrained by a single dominant metaphor-humanness [35]. Most commercial VUIs are designed to mimic human conversational abilities, using speech, turn-taking, and natural language processing to create an interaction model that feels intuitive [39, 79]. Within this overarching metaphor, VUIs are often framed as social entities that take on various roles, including teachers, therapists, coaches, advisors, and companions [25-27, 53, 65, 71, 80, 86, 89]. Among these, the assistant persona has emerged as the most prevalent, dominating commercial implementations and positioning the VUI as a helpful, subservient entity designed to execute user commands [29, 34]. While this metaphor provides a familiar interaction paradigm, it also imposes significant limitations. It assumes a fixed, one-size-fits-all identity for the VUI, failing to account for the fluid nature of human-VUI interactions across different tasks and contexts [25, 28, 30, 79]. This rigidity leads to usability challenges [23], mismatches between user expectations and system behavior [34], and broader concerns surrounding anthropomorphic design choices [28, 67, 69, 79, 84, 87].\nThese challenges reflect a broader issue in interface design: the role of metaphors in shaping user interaction. Metaphors have played a foundational role in shaping Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) [16, 17, 33, 63, 64, 73]. In Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), they are structured into primary and secondary layers: the desktop metaphor, for instance, serves as the primary organizing concept, with secondary metaphors-such as files, folders, and recycling bins-providing finer interaction affordances [11]. These layered metaphors help users form coherent mental models of system functionality. In contrast, VUIs lack a stable visual representation, making their metaphorical framing less explicit. Instead, this framing is operationalized through persona design, where a VUI's voice, linguistic style, and response behaviors collectively establish its identity [79]. Unlike GUIs, where metaphors map interactions onto familiar objects, VUIs inherently imply personhood, reinforcing anthropomorphic interpretations. The presence of human-like speech cues, names, and conversational norms encourages users to assign social roles to VUIs, often expecting them to behave with intelligence, adaptability, and even emotional awareness [67, 85].\nDespite this anthropomorphic framing, users do not engage with VUIs as static entities [78]. Instead, they shift their metaphorical framings depending on use-contexts-the functional settings in which interactions take place [29]. Prior research has identified several recurring use-contexts in VUI interactions, including commands, where users expect"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "VUIs enable users to interact naturally through spoken language and are embedded in a range of consumer technologies, including smart speakers, smartphones, headphones, and even household appliances. Popular examples include Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant, which have become integral to everyday interactions. However, the term VUI is often used interchangeably with other labels, such as Intelligent Personal Assistants, Digital Assistants, Conversational Agents (CAs), Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), and Speech Interfaces [21]. While these terms share similarities, they differ in scope. For instance, CAs and CUIs encompass both voice- and text-based systems, including chatbots, whereas VUIs specifically refer to interfaces that rely on voice as the primary input and output modality.\nGiven this terminological overlap, it is essential to clarify the scope of this research. This article focuses explicitly on disembodied, software-based VUIs-systems that process and generate spoken language without physical embodiments, such as robots or avatars. However, given the broader relevance of CUIs in conversational Al research, we reference CUIs where applicable to contextualize and discuss our findings within the wider discourse on human-AI interaction."}, {"title": "2.1 Metaphors-A Brief Primer", "content": "Metaphors are more than just literary flourishes; they are fundamental tools for understanding and interpreting the world [50]. In linguistics and cognitive science, metaphors have been shown to shape not only how we communicate but also how we think [44]. According to Lakoff and Johnson's theory of conceptual metaphors, our understanding of abstract concepts is often structured by metaphors derived from concrete experiences [62]. For example, when we say \"time is money,\" we are using a metaphor to conceptualize time as a valuable resource, which affects how we perceive and manage it [62].\nMetaphors are powerful because they influence cognition and behavior, often in subtle ways. They help bridge the gap between the familiar and the unfamiliar, making complex ideas more accessible [44]. By providing a conceptual structure, metaphors allow individuals to grasp abstract concepts by relating them to more concrete experiences. In cognitive psychology, metaphors have been found to shape reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving processes, thereby playing an integral role in how knowledge is constructed and applied [15, 70]. Through metaphors, we can connect domains that are seemingly unrelated, fostering creativity and enabling us to generate novel ideas [66]. In science and"}, {"title": "2.2 Metaphors in HCI", "content": "Metaphors in HCI have profoundly shaped how users conceptualize and interact with technology. By leveraging familiar concepts (e.g., files, folders), metaphors bridge the gap between users' prior knowledge and new digital environments, simplifying interactions and reducing cognitive load [17, 73]. The desktop metaphor stands out as a pivotal example in GUIs, drawing on the physical analogy of an office desk to provide users with a coherent mental model for navigating digital spaces [52]. This foundational desktop metaphor is supplemented with secondary metaphors like folders, files, bins, scrolling, and icons and translates abstract computational processes into familiar actions, such as \"dragging a file to the trash\" to discard a document [22].\nThe impact of the desktop metaphor extends far beyond mere visual representation. It has played a crucial role in making computers more approachable and familiar, significantly contributing to their widespread adoption [16]. By aligning user expectations with system capabilities, the desktop metaphor has fostered increased usability and user satisfaction. Furthermore, it has provided a common language for developers and users to communicate about new technologies, facilitating the ongoing evolution of human-computer interfaces. The desktop metaphor's influence on early computing systems was so profound that it shaped users' mental models for decades. For a detailed exploration of its history and significance, Alan Blackwell's work offers an in-depth analysis that underscores the metaphor's lasting impact on HCI design principles [11]."}, {"title": "2.3 Metaphors in VUIs", "content": "The study of metaphors in VUIs is relatively new compared to their rich history in HCI. The foundational \"humanness\" metaphor serves as the principal metaphor in VUI design, where VUIs are often deployed in human-like social roles for VUIs, ranging from educators and coaches to storytellers and even therapists [25-27, 53, 65, 71, 89]. This approach aims to create a sense of familiarity by aligning VUIs with known social roles, thereby making interactions more intuitive and accessible [29, 69]. VUIs like Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri are designed to function as digital assistants, drawing on the metaphor of the helpful human assistant to facilitate tasks such as playing music, providing information,"}, {"title": "2.4 Mitigating Challenges in VUI Design", "content": "As the VUI design space evolves, various approaches have been proposed to address the challenges surrounding VUI persona design. One promising approach involves developing VUIs in non-human roles. Desai and Twidale [29], through a literature review and user study, identified how metaphors are used by users, designers, manufacturers, and researchers in relation to VUIs. Based on their analysis, they developed a framework for metaphor contextualization in VUIs, categorizing metaphor use along four dimensions: type (human, non-human, fictional), mentioned by (users, designers, manufacturers, researchers), the knowledge it draws upon, and the motivation behind its use. Their findings revealed that while human metaphors dominate VUI design and research, non-human and fictional metaphors were also popular, especially among users for sense-making. This contrast highlights a dichotomy between how designers and researchers present VUIs and how users interpret them. This observation points to the need for a \"pragmatic approach\" [16] to systematically explore the design space between system capabilities and user expectations.\nIn the broader CUI literature, there have been recent notable advancements in exploring the feasibility of designing conversational agents with non-human roles. Jung et al. [54], for instance, used the Great Chain of Being (GCOB) framework to investigate how non-human metaphors (such as God, Animal, Plant, and Book) compared to human metaphors influence user perceptions of chatbots. Their results showed that the human metaphor did not significantly alter chatbot evaluations compared to non-human metaphors. Similarly, in a related study involving VUIs, researchers examined human versus non-human metaphors in the health and finance domains. They found that in the health domain, users preferred the human metaphor (doctor) in terms of likability and enjoyability, while in the finance domain,"}, {"title": "3 Toward Metaphor-Fluid Design", "content": "The discussion so far has established that metaphors play an important role in VUIs. As discussed in the previous sections, metaphors help users construct mental models for interaction, guiding their expectations of system behavior [16, 17, 22]. However, unlike in GUIs-where spatial and object-based metaphors provide a persistent conceptual framework [11]-metaphors in VUIs lack a stable visual anchor and must instead be inferred from interaction patterns. This fundamental difference has led to a design paradigm where system personas serve as implicit metaphors, mapping VUI behavior onto familiar social roles such as assistants, coaches, or companions [25-27, 53, 65, 71, 89]. While these persona-based framings are intended to provide consistency, empirical findings suggest that users do not experience VUIs as singular, fixed entities. Instead, they reframe their mental models dynamically, adjusting their conceptualization of the system based on the nature of the interaction [29, 78]. For example, Desai and Twidale [29] found that when retrieving information, users tend to conceptualize VUIs as search engines or librarians, whereas in casual conversation, they are more likely to ascribe relational qualities, perceiving the VUI as a companion or conversational partner-sometimes within the same interaction session. These shifts occur fluidly and without explicit user effort, reflecting how people naturally adjust their conversational framing based on social and functional context.\nDespite this, current VUI design does not reflect this inherent metaphorical flexibility. Instead, designers have historically favored a single, unified persona, treating it as a stable interface identity that remains consistent across"}, {"title": "4 Study 1: Mapping VUI Metaphors to Conversational Use-Contexts", "content": "To address RQ1, we conducted Study 1, which explores the metaphors that commonly align with users' interactions across various use-contexts in conversations with VUIs. Specifically, we investigated four key use-contexts: commands, information seeking, sociality, and error recovery. Our approach involved several interconnected steps. We began by identifying commonly used metaphors employed by both users and designers to describe VUIs. These ranged from designer-intended metaphors aimed at establishing familiarity in specific scenarios (e.g., \"Therapist\") to user-generated metaphors for sense-making during VUI interactions (e.g., \"Child\"). Following this, we developed and justified the selection of the four use-contexts employed in this study, basing our choices on a thorough review of empirically grounded VUI literature involving user studies. To align the identified metaphors with these use-contexts, we adopted a two-dimensional scale that maps the social dimensions of the metaphors against the desired attributes of each use-context."}, {"title": "4.1 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1.1 Metaphor Identification", "content": "Our metaphor collection process drew from two significant sources, combining a comprehensive literature review with user studies to gather a wide range of VUI metaphors.

An initial search in the ACM digital library using a complex query yielded 664 articles, which were screened down to 80 for final analysis.

Interestingly, although error recovery is not a task in itself, it still leads to conversations and often evokes amusing metaphorical comparisons from users (e.g., a silly child or a pet). Furthermore, they adopt Epley et al.'s [40] definition of sociality to include social tasks such as playing games and engaging in small talk-a definition that we also adopt in this work.\nWhile Desai and Twidale [29] classified use-contexts through metaphor analysis, other studies have used usage logs to categorize conversational use-contexts. Bentley et al. [9] analyzed usage logs from 88 households over an average of 110 days, identifying ten conversational use-contexts: music, information, automation, small talk, alarms, weather, video, time, lists, and others.

The two dimensions of SCM are warmth and competence. Similarly, Argyle's model includes dominant-submissive and hostile-friendly.\nKhadpe et al. [56] designed chatbots using metaphors sampled along the dimensions of warmth (being good-natured and friendly) and competence (being intelligent) for human-AI collaboration tasks. The researchers found that designing AI chatbots with high warmth was beneficial in all scenarios, but the effect of competence depended on users' prior expectations. In another study investigating the effect of warmth and competence on users' intention to adopt an AI system, Gilad et al. [45] found warmth to be a much more crucial factor than competence. However, in general, prior work agrees that designing AI systems with high warmth and high competence is an effective approach [45, 54, 56].\nMore pertinent to VUIs, Braun et al. [14] used Argyle's model of attitude towards others and placed metaphors like Sherlock Holmes, Sheldon Cooper, HAL9000, etc., along the dimensions of dominant-submissive and hostile-friendly. However, in their preliminary study, the researchers found a hostile agent to be unsuitable-similar to previously mentioned studies in which participants showed a higher preference for high-warmth metaphors. Consequently, based on user feedback, the researchers changed the hostile-friendly scale to a 'formality' scale of casual-formal.

The core of the study involved participants rating 20 diverse metaphors and 20 common tasks or scenarios across four use-contexts: commands, sociality, information seeking, and error recovery. The metaphors ranged from human roles (such as Admirer, Butler, and Teacher) to non-human concepts (like the \"Computer\" from Star Trek and the Search Engine). Both metaphors and scenarios were presented to each participant in a randomized sequence to mitigate potential order effects. Participants rated these on two scales: from 'very casual' to 'very formal', and from 'very subordinate' to 'very dominant'. This approach aimed to gauge the expected levels of formality and hierarchy in VUI interactions. The scenarios covered various interactions, from mundane tasks like playing music to more complex situations involving incomplete information or philosophical discussions. Additionally, participants were asked to consider VUI responses in error scenarios, providing insights into desired VUI behavior during suboptimal interactions.

Among these, 5 metaphors were distinctly non-human-such as \"Computer\" from Star Trek, Encyclopedia, Family Pet, Genie, and Search Engine-and 2 metaphors, specifically \"Computer\" from Star Trek and Genie, were fictional in nature. Out of all use-contexts, interestingly, only one human metaphor-Admirer for Sociality-was rated as the most suitable for the chosen use-contexts.\nThis finding is insightful because it challenges the common assumption that human metaphors would naturally be the most relatable or suitable for VUIs. Instead, our results suggest that non-human and fictional metaphors are often more compatible with users' desired levels of formality and hierarchy in interactions. This aligns with previous work, such as Pradhan et al. [78], who found that older adults categorize VUIs as both persons and objects, underscoring the unique hybrid role VUIs occupy. Similarly, Jung et al. [54] found no significant preference for human over non-human metaphors in chatbots, challenging the assumption that human-like qualities are inherently more effective. Desai et al. [30] further showed that metaphor preferences are context-dependent, with human metaphors preferred in health but no clear preference in finance.\nThese findings provide important implications for VUI designers: selecting metaphors that users find appropriate may require moving beyond the human metaphor and instead embracing characters that exist outside of human conventions and cultural associations. There is a natural tendency in conversation design to rely on human metaphors [29, 35], though these often come with ethical and practical concerns, as previously discussed. By contrast, non-human metaphors remain relatively underutilized, even though previous findings suggest that these metaphors may be better suited for user-centered interaction design [30].\nOne reason for this could be the absence of cultural baggage-non-human and fictional characters often present a cleaner slate, allowing users to approach VUIs without preconceived biases. For instance, the concept of an 'Assistant' might vary greatly depending on individuals' experiences, whereas characters like a Genie or \"Computer\" from Star Trek have clearly defined roles popularized through mass media, setting consistent and realistic expectations. Furthermore, these non-human and fictional metaphors often appear in assistive roles in popular culture, similar to how commercial VUIs function in our everyday lives. They provide a more accessible and pragmatic way for users to conceptualize VUI interactions.\nA character like a Genie, for example, is culturally ingrained as an entity that is always ready to fulfill a request-akin to how VUIs operate with wake words such as \"Hey Google\" or \"Alexa.\" This parallel between the invocation of mythical beings and modern technology helps establish a natural and inviting interaction model. Among the metaphors we studied, the Genie stood out as particularly compelling. It was rated as the most suitable metaphor across multiple-use-contexts, resonating with users for its distinctive mix of neutral formality and slight subordination. This balance makes the Genie metaphor feel approachable but not overly familiar, attentive but not intrusive-much like the lore of a genie, who is always present to fulfill wishes upon being summoned. This metaphor is not necessarily an instruction to personify VUIs as genies but rather an invitation to identify the underlying traits that make the metaphor resonate with users. It also solidifies the idea of using magic as a transporting metaphor in AI design [68].\nThe broader role of a Guide, which embodies these characteristics, appears to include a wide range of metaphors-from the human-like Admirer to the more technological Search Engine and the fictional Genie.

These designs fall within the broader domain of conversation design, a field that is still in its formative stages. Currently, there is a notable lack of standardized design processes followed by conversation designers [81]. Moreover, there are few design tools or pre-defined personas that can be readily deployed, leaving designers to navigate these challenges on their own. As a result, conversation designers often rely on guidelines provided by industry leaders such as Google and IBM, adapting these frameworks to suit specific contexts. To address these challenges, the first author, who has eight years of experience in conversation design, designed the interactions for our study. Two experts, each with six years of experience, further validated the designs, ensuring an informed approach to the development of the VUIs.\nWhile designing the VUI interactions, our primary focus was to ensure ecological validity. To achieve this, we drew on insights from Bentley et al. [9], who analyzed user logs from 88 diverse homes over a 110-day period, encompassing 66,459 interactions. Their study explored the long-term use of voice assistants, revealing two key patterns that informed our design: (1) users fluidly transitioned between use-contexts within the same interaction session, and (2) the average session length was 5.4 interaction turns. Incorporating these findings, we developed scripts featuring six interaction turns, including five unique commands and one error recovery instance, across four use-contexts.\nWe designed Metaphor-Fluid VUI using the metaphors Genie, \"Computer\" from Star Trek, Admirer, and Search Engine for the use-contexts Commands, Information Seeking, Sociality, and Error Recovery respectively. To design VUI using the Genie metaphor, we used the taxonomy developed by Lupetti et al. [68] examining the role of enchantment in design communication using magic metaphors. Specifically, we used the communication style of Genie from Arabian Nights cartoons to invite the users to \"suspend their disbelief\" using familiar tropes. For example, the VUI portrayed a friendly and jovial Genie reading a magical orb to provide weather updates. To design the VUI using the Admirer metaphor, we focused on creating a warm and supportive persona. The Admirer uses affirming and enthusiastic communication to foster a positive interaction. For instance, when a user asks for a joke, the VUI starts with, \"You know, you have the best taste in humor,\" before delivering the punchline. This approach reflects the Admirer's intent to please the user and make interactions enjoyable. For \"Computer\" from Star Trek metaphor, we used analysis by Axtell et al. [4] who studied dialogs by the Enterprise Computer and the crew from Star Trek: The Next Generation including 587 interactions. The analysis revealed that \"Computer\" used brief and functional dialogs, and included relevant strategies such as indicating actions in progress (using the keyword \"accessing\") and asking clarifying questions.

Speechify was chosen for its ability to produce realistic synthetic conversations using multiple voices, which aligned with the study's design requirements. While an initial approach considered employing a human voice actor for the user's role and reserving TTS exclusively for the VUI, pilot testing revealed challenges in maintaining a consistent pitch and tone with the human voice across the experimental conditions. These inconsistencies risked introducing confounding variables, as prior research, such as Dubiel et al. [37, 38], has shown that subtle differences in vocal characteristics can significantly affect user perceptions. Consequently, we opted to use synthetic voices for both the user and the VUI.\nIn choosing the synthetic voices, we aimed to align with gender representation norms observed in commercial VUIs, such as Siri and Alexa, which often use female-sounding voices [24]. To ensure a clear auditory distinction between the VUI and the user, we assigned a female-sounding voice to the VUI and a male-sounding voice to the user. This decision was informed by literature suggesting that voice gender may influence user perception [59]. To further mitigate biases associated with the VUI's identity, we designated the VUI as 'Z, a neutral name devoid of gender or racial connotations, to minimize confounding effects on the study's outcomes. For consistency across all experimental conditions, we used Speechify's synthetic male voice \"Guy\" for the user, setting the tone to \"chat\" to enhance the voice's human-like qualities. For the VUI, we selected the female voice \"Aria\" with a neutral tone setting of \"none.\" All other parameters, such as speech rate, speed, and volume, were standardized at zero percent modifications to ensure uniformity.\nBefore each conversation, participants heard a brief introductory prompt: \"You are about to hear a conversation between a user with a male-sounding voice and a voice interface named 'Z', with a female-sounding voice.\" This prompt was delivered using the synthetic voice \"Davis,\" configured with the same settings as the study clips to ensure consistency and avoid introducing any additional variables.

Meanwhile, Perceived Likability and Perceived Intelligence showed mixed results: Perceived Likability was slightly higher for the Metaphor-Fluid VUI (4.16 \u00b1 0.84) compared to the Default VUI (3.93 \u00b1 0.87), whereas Perceived Intelligence was slightly higher for the Default VUI (4.20 \u00b1 0.65) than the Metaphor-Fluid VUI (4.09 \u00b1 0.73)."}, {"title": "5.5.2 Metaphor Analysis", "content": "In addition to examining how a Metaphor-Fluid VUI compares to a Default VUI in terms of user perceptions, we also explored whether these differences influence the metaphors users use to describe each interface.

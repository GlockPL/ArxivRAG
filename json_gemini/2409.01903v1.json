In practice, medication review is a long and cognitively-demanding task that requires specific knowledge. Clinical practice guidelines have been proposed, but their application is tedious.\nMethods: We designed ABiMed, a clinical decision support system for medication reviews, based on the implementation of the STOPP/START v2 guidelines and on the visual presentation of aggregated drug knowledge using tables, graphs and flower glyphs. We evaluated ABiMed with 39 community pharmacists during a randomized simulation trial, each pharmacist performing a medication review for two fictitious patients without ABiMed, and two others with ABiMed. We recorded the problems identified by the pharmacists, the interventions proposed, the response time, the perceived usability and the comments. Pharmacists' medication reviews were compared to an expert-designed gold standard.\nResults: With ABiMed, pharmacists found 1.6 times more relevant drug-related problems during the medication review (p = 1.1 \u00d7 10-12) and proposed better interventions (p = 9.8 \u00d7 10-9), without needing more time (p = 0.56). The System Usability Scale score is 82.7, which is ranked \u201cexcellent\u201d. In their comments, pharmacists appreciated the visual aspect of ABiMed and its ability to compare the current treatment with the proposed one. A multifactor analysis showed no difference in the support offered by ABiMed according to the pharmacist's age or sex, in terms of percentage of problems identified or quality of the proposed interventions.\nConclusions: The use of an intelligent and visual clinical decision support system can help pharmacists when they perform medication reviews. Our main perspective is the validation of the system in clinical conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The worldwide population of people aged 65 or over is expected to double, rising from 761 million to 1.6 billion by 2050 [1]. Many of them are exposed to polypharmacy (taking 5+ long term drugs [2, 3]), which is associated with potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) and drug-related problem (DRP) including adverse drug events (ADE) [4]. In France, inappropriate prescriptions concern more than one in two elderly patients and their direct cost is 507 million \u20ac per year [5].\nGeneral practitioners (GPs) are open to deprescribing inappropriate drugs [6], but often lack time and pharmacological knowledge. Pharmacists could play a key role [7], by conducting Medication Review (MR), \u201ca structured evaluation of a patient's medicines with the aim of optimizing medicines use and improving health outcomes. This entails detecting drug-related problems and recommending interventions\" [8]. MR can change practices [9], reduce hospitalizations [10, 11] and saves costs [12, 13]. However, MR is a complex task, requiring efficient collaboration with the GP, but also strong skills in clinical pharmacy [14, 15].\nTo perform MR, pharmacists can be assisted by drug databases offering a pharmaceutical description of all marketed drugs, and clinical practice guidelines supporting MR [16, 17], e.g. STOPP/START [18, 19]. It includes STOPP rules for detecting PIMs, and START rules for detecting potential omissions. Studies demonstrated its ability to improve prescribing appropriateness [20]. However, drug databases provide one page per drug, which is tedious when the patient takes many drugs, and guidelines, in their paper format, are time-consuming and difficult to apply in clinical routine [21].\nClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been designed to overcome these limitations [22]. A recent scoping review [23] found 19 CDSSs for managing polypharmacy in the elderly. Most of them implement paper guidelines by automating their recommendations, or give access to drug knowledge. But the review highlighted limits: the targeted user is often the physician instead of the pharmacist, and the output is often displayed in a non-friendly format (e.g. long text).\nTo overcome these limitations, we designed ABiMed [24, 25], a CDSS for helping community pharmacists to perform type-3 MR (i.e. including patient interview and clinical data [8]). ABiMed associates two approaches: it implements STOPP/START rules but also provides aggregated drug knowledge in a visual format, based on visual analytics. The objective of this paper is to describe a randomized simulation trial [26] evaluating ABiMed in comparison to the usual practice. Our main hypothesis is that, with ABiMed, pharmacists will be able to identify more PIMs and DRP, and to propose better pharmaceutical interventions to solve these problems."}, {"title": "2. Materials and methods", "content": "ABiMed is a CDSS for medication review and polypharmacy management [25, 24]. It helps at three levels: (1) it facilitates communication between pharmacists and GPs, and extracts patient data from the GP's EHR; (2) it provides drug knowledge contextualized for the patient, in a visual format (Figure 1); and (3) it implements the STOPP/START v2 guidelines [18] through a rule-based system that takes into account drugs (ATC classes but also indications and doses), clinical conditions (ICD10 codes) and biology (LOINC codes and associated values). ABiMed integrates the Theriaque drug database [27]. It proposes a comparative mode, comparing the current treatment with the treatment after the interventions proposed during MR, to check that these interventions solve the problems identified without introducing new problems.\nThe current evaluation does not focus on the pharmacist-GP collaboration.

Recruitment", "content": "We recruited community pharmacists having a clinical practice in France. We excluded pharmacists refusing to participate or without Internet access. Pharmacists were recruited by emails, via lists of pharmacists from associations and territorial professional health communities. They were compensated for their participation. Pharmacists followed an online training session via webinar (one hour). We presented to them the project and its goal, the ABiMed software and the evaluation principles."}, {"title": "2.3. Clinical cases and gold standard", "content": "An expert comity including two pharmacists (S Dubois, R L\u00e9guillon), a GP (HF) and three researchers in health informatics with MD or PharmD (AM, RT, JBL) designed four clinical cases, A, B, C, D, based on realistic situations (Table 1). Each consisted of an elderly patient with polypharmacy, consulting his/her pharmacist for a problem leading to a MR. All clinical data was filled in the case; thus, during MRs, no data entry was needed."}, {"title": "2.4. Protocol", "content": "The study followed a sequential group protocol, in which each pharmacist first carried out two cases without ABiMed (i.e. control cases) online, and then two with ABiMed (i.e. test cases). Pharmacists were asked to use their usual resources when not having ABiMed. All pharmacists performed MRs both with and without ABiMed and solved the same cases, but with different order of passages. Pharmacists were randomized into 4 groups (Table 2). Control cases were carried out before test cases, to avoid any learning phenomenon when using ABiMed.\nThis protocol permits all pharmacists to test ABiMed, which allows collecting the qualitative opinion of all pharmacists, and increases the statistical power, each participant being its own control. Moreover, in previous studies, we found that participants in the control group lacked motivation and were more likely to give up, compromising the entire study.\nThe INSERM ethics evaluation committee (IRB00003888) reviewed and approved the study."}, {"title": "2.5. Data collected", "content": "For each pharmacist, we collected:\n(1) demographic data (online questionnaire): age group, gender (male, female, other), number of MRs carried out the last year, previous knowledge of STOPP/START (Boolean).\n(2) for each case (automatic collection): problems identified and pharmaceutical interventions proposed by the pharmacist, response time.\n(3) satisfaction questionnaire: SUS scale (System Usability Scale [29]) comprising 10 questions with 5 possible answers, and free comments.\nClinical cases were corrected semi-automatically. Interventions were rated using CLEO scores, the maximum value was the value defined in the gold standard, and lower values were given for suboptimal interventions. The minimum value was -1, for harmful interventions. Interventions proposed by pharmacists were automatically matched with the gold standard. In case of match, we considered the problem as identified and the intervention as having its maximum value. Then, cases were manually and blindly reviewed by S Dubois, HF and JBL. We verified problems and interventions, taking into account textual comments."}, {"title": "2.6. Criteria", "content": "The primary criterion was (1) the percentage of problems identified in the MR, obtained by dividing the number of problems the pharmacist identified by the number of problems in the gold standard.\nSecondary criteria were:\n(2) the CLEO score ratio, obtained by dividing the sum of the pharmacist's interventions CLEO scores by the sum of the gold standard interventions CLEO scores,\n(3) the overall time spent to perform a MR,\n(4) the pharmacist perceived usability, measured by SUS.\nFor example, a pharmacist identified 2 problems in case #A and proposed 2 interventions, of CLEO score 1 and 2; the percentage of problems identified is 33.3% (since case #A has 6 problems) and the CLEO score ratio is 30% (since case #A has a total of 10 CLEO score and only 1 + 2 = 3 were proposed)."}, {"title": "2.7.

Response times", "content": "The right part of table 4 shows mean and median response times, without and with ABiMed. There is no significant difference. Thus, the use of ABiMed did not require additional time for pharmacists, but did not allow gaining time either. However, as pharmacists identified more problems with ABiMed, the per-problem response time is lower.\nThe complex LLM model (Table 5, right part) identified one significant factor and one interaction: cases and ABiMed-age interaction. Figure 4 suggests that, with ABiMed, younger pharmacists were slightly faster and older pharmacists slightly slower. Younger pharmacists might be more comfortable with computerized CDSSs.

Well done!\"), the graph showing drug interactions (\u201cI find that the interaction tab is very practical", "the adverse effects tab is very useful and visual: it could be used on a daily basis at the counter, even outside of medication reviews! Well done\"). They also appreciated the comparative mode of ABiMed (\\\"a good way to train and learn by adding and testing several molecules together according to different patient profiles.\\\").\nSeveral pharmacists mentioned that ABiMed was very useful for identifying problems, but more limited when it comes to proposing interventions and suggesting replacement drugs. They proposed the implementation of additional guidelines, targeting the main disorders for elderly patients.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"4. Discussion\",\n      \"content\": \"In this paper, we presented a simulation trial evaluating ABiMed, a CDSS for supporting MR. Results show that, with ABiMed, pharmacists identified more problems and proposed better interventions, without spending more time.\nThe participants were community pharmacists with a clinical activity, and not students, contrary to many studies. Recruiting professionals is much more difficult, as they have less time available. As being older, they may also be less open to innovation and digital tools. However, they are more representative of the target users of ABiMed.\nResults suggest that the support offered by ABiMed may vary according to the patient profile: for problem identification, the mean is the same for all cases without ABiMed (about 45%) but differs with ABiMed (60-85%); for interventions (CLEO score ratio), no difference is found for case D. This was related to an alert for domperidone that was missing in ABiMed; the associated intervention (deprescription) was ranked 4 on the CLEO scale. Actually, pharmacists performed better with ABiMed for other problems of case D, but worse for the domperidone, as they were relying on ABiMed guidance. This is known as automation bias [31]. Thus, we should take a particular care to missing alerts.\nSex had no significant impact, as well as the sex-ABiMed interaction. It means that the support provided by ABiMed is the same for males and females, despite cognitive capacities sometimes differ, e.g. color perception [32].\nSurprisingly, the previous knowledge of STOPP/START and the number of MRs performed in the last year had no significant impact. Possibly, the knowledge of STOPP/START is not enough to execute the numerous and complex rules manually, and many pharmacists did zero or one MR, thus the impact of this factor may be difficult to analyze.\nThe main limit of the study is that it is a simulation trial [26]: pharmacists may not have acted as they would on real patients. However, simulation trials are often used for CDSSs because of their simplicity to set up, e.g. [33]. They also permit a better comparison, since the same fictitious patients can be treated both with and without the CDSS.\nAnother limit is that all patient data was available in the system, thus pharmacists did not have to enter any additional data and just focused on the analysis. This does not correspond to reality: pharmacists often have limited access to patient data [34] (usually stored in electronic health records owned by GPs or hospitals), and some data is of questionable quality, or still in textual format, that machines cannot interpret [35]. Data entry has been a huge barrier when testing the PRIMA-eDS CDSS for managing polypharmacy [36]. To overcome this problem, we proposed in another work an adaptive questionnaire for facilitating the entry of patient clinical conditions for the automatic execution of STOPP/START rules [37]. Nevertheless, the integration of ABiMed into the medical workflow remains a matter of future research.\nFinally, pharmacists were paid volunteers, which might bias the results.\nIn the literature, several CDSSs were clinically evaluated for the support of MR, and were reviewed in [38]. However, most were less sophisticated than ABiMed, being limited to triggering guideline-based alerts or detecting adverse reactions, or focused on hospital rather than primary care. Hospital CDSSS for polypharmacy obtain better results [39], possibly due to the use of EHR. Outside hospital, examples include: the detection of outlier prescriptions via machine-learning for outpatients [40], the use of PHARAO, a system evaluating risk for common side-effects in hospital and primary care [41], the execution of STOPP rules in nursing homes [13], and the triggering of alerts from an electronic expert support system in geriatric clinics and primary care [42].\nContrary to ABiMed, few visual approaches were proposed, e.g. the use of colored tables to present interactions [43], and most systems targeted physicians rather than pharmacists. Exceptions include: a limited 5-rule alert system [44], and a more substantial alert system but associated with a low sensitivity [45]. In that context, the visual presentation of drug knowledge can be a complementary approach, as it is less intrusive than alerts, and not limited to a few situations but can include all drug interactions.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"5.

{"title": "A SURVEY ON BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE\nWITH PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "authors": ["Zhengdong Luo"], "abstract": "Supply Chain Finance is very important for supply chain competition, which is an important tool\nto activate the capital flow in the supply chain. Supply Chain Finance-related research can support\nmultiple applications and services, such as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk\nmanagement, and optimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of\nBlockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in finance. With the characteris-\ntics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof, cryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization,\nBlockchain fits well with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data integrity,\nauthenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is time to summarize the applications of\nBlockchain technology in the field of Supply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings\nto Supply Chain Finance is not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit\ndisassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance operations through smart\ncontracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in combination with other technologies, such\nas artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work\nin Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain Finance oriented\napplications, but most of these work are at the management level to propose conceptual frameworks\nor simply use Blockchain without exploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic\nreviews providing a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of Blockchain-based Supply\nChain Finance. In this paper, we provide an overview of Supply Chain Finance and Blockchain\ntechnology, including brief knowledge and respective main applications. Furthermore, we summa-\nrize the current hot applications of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance and give some future\ndirections with a forward-looking orientation in pursuit. This is the first comprehensive survey that\ntargets the study of Blockchain technology for the Supply Chain Finance from computer science\nperspective, and also offers a collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers\nand practitioners working in different Supply Chain Finance and Blockchain fields.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Supply Chain Finance has a profound impact on industrial upgrading, capital optimization and cost reduction[1].\nFinancing difficulties have become an important issue for global trade. According to the data released by WTO in\nAugust 20211, the global trade finance gap increased by 15% to $1.7 trillion in 2020 compared to the investigation\ntwo years ago. As indicated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)2, the acceptance rate of Small and Medium\nEnterprises(SMEs) financing was 23% and the rejection rate was 40% of the banked trade finance applications, which\nwas more serious compared with the 54% acceptance rate and 42% rejection rate of large enterprises. Of course the\neconomic downturn and the impact of the COVID-19 are important causes of financing difficulties, but at the same\ntime another reason is related to the global level of development on Supply Chain Financing. Supply Chain Finance\nis an important tool to help supply chain to finance, which can alleviate the problems of long accounting period,\ninsufficient funds to expand business, products occupying funds, etc. Supply Chain Finance plays an important role in\nco-creating value by adjusting capital flow, optimizing capital flow management, and mitigating financing risks[2, 3].\nOn the other hand, Blockchain technology as a new technology is gradually receiving attention in various fields, such\nas healthcare [4, 5, 6], smart city[7, 8, 9], and Supply Chain Finance[10, 11, 12, 13]. Blockchain is considered as a\nnext-generation information technology that redefines the world[14], so it is the duty and obligation of Blockchain\ntechnology researchers to use this advanced technology to help Supply Chain Finance operations and management\nbecome more intelligent and convenient. For these reasons, the research related to Blockchain-based Supply Chain\nFinance has been a very important and promising field.\nThe research on Blockchain technology and Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance started relatively late and has only\nbeen developed in the last decade and more, while as far as we can find the earliest paper on Blockchain-based Supply\nChain Finance was published in 2018[15]. Subsequently, more and more research work has been done, and the depth of\nresearch has gone from simple application to exploring the application of innovative Blockchain attributes. Initially,\nBlockchain-based Supply Chain Finance was only a simple application of Blockchain to more management-level\nskills. For example, Supply Chain Finance information symmetry sharing[16], Supply Chain Finance financing model\nimprovement[17], and supply chain financial service platform construction[18]. Many of them present conceptual\nmodels and do not have experimental validation or practical testing. This makes the work lack some degree of credibility.\nLater, scholars' research gradually gets deeper rather than just applying, and start to explore the combination of the\ncharacteristics of Blockchain and the business needs of Supply Chain Finance, and apply Blockchain technology to\nSupply Chain Finance from the computer science level, such as the improvement of Supply Chain Finance data storage\nmethod[19], the study of Supply Chain Finance risk management model[20], and smart contract to help automate\nSupply Chain Finance[21]. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available Supply Chain\nFinance dataset online, let alone a Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance dataset.\nConsidering that Blockchain technology research is inevitably getting deeper and deeper, we propose a vision of\nBlockchain computing, which aims to combine different computer technologies with Blockchain applications to\ndifferent domains, instead of simply regarding Blockchain as a distributed storage database, the goal of Blockchain\ncomputing is to expand the storage database into an intelligent computational database. To the best of our knowledge,\nProfessor Raj Jai et al. first proposed the concept of extended Blockchain34, which emphasizes the extension of\nBlockchain with artificial intelligence for risk management and decision making. However, they do not give a clear\ndefinition of Blockchain computing for this purpose. In a broad sense, what we consider as Blockchain computing\nis not limited to the combination of artificial intelligence, but also data mining, big data, etc. The application field of\nBlockchain computing is also not just risk management and decision making. We present for the first time here through\none future research hot-spot of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. Besides that, there are many open questions\nto answer. For example, what is the relationship between supply chain and Supply Chain Finance? What exactly is\nBlockchain technology? What are the representative applications of Blockchain technology in Supply Chain Finance?\nWhat is the method of classifying these applications employed? What are the potential interesting future directions on\nBlockchain-based Supply Chain Finance?\nTo answer these questions, we introduce the theory, current research status and future research on Blockchain-based\nSupply Chain Finance from three modules: Supply Chain Finance, Blockchain technology, and Blockchain+Supply\nChain Finance. Some related surveys have been done. For example, For example, [22] gave a simple survey on\nBlockchain-based Supply Chain Finance risk control. However, it explores the Loan-to-Value rate, financing schemes,\nand financial derivatives from a management perspective. The survey of the current state of research and future\ndirections presented by[23, 24] was only focused on Supply Chain Finance. As to the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first survey of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance, not specifically in the direction of risk control, and not\njust an review of Supply Chain Finance, but an overview of Blockchain technology applied to Supply Chain Finance.\nAlso, the current survey of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance is indeed rare. This survey aims to provide a\ncomprehensive summary of the current Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance applications to identify the issues\nto be addressed and to point out the future directions. It seeks to consider the relationship between Blockchain and\nSupply Chain Finance from a computer science perspective, to establish a link between Blockchain technology and\nSupply Chain Finance-related fields, and to provide a good reference for the development of Blockchain technology\nand Supply Chain Finance-related applications in various fields. Our survey pursues a prospective exploration rather\nthan a comprehensive summary. To this end, about 189 studies are shortlisted and classified in this survey."}, {"title": "2 Supply Chain Finance", "content": "This survey is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the overview of the basic knowledge and research direction on\nSupply Chain Finance.

We finally concludes the article in Section\n6."}, {"title": "2.1 Supply Chain Finance overview.", "content": "With the expanding trend of trade globalization, the supply chain mechanism has become more and more complex,\nthe upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain are widely under the pressure of capital flow. The core\nenterprises, with the dominant control over the status of supply chain business, have caused delays to the billing periods\nof upstream and downstream enterprises in the consideration of maximum financial returns. The core enterprises\nare normally large enterprises with favorable reputation for financing, while the financing problem faced by Small\nand Medium Enterprises in the supply chain is always a big trouble. At the same time, the traditional inter-company\ncompetition is transforming into a market competition among supply chains. In addition to the global economic\nslowdown, the research work on Supply Chain Finance, which aims to improve the financing difficulties of Small and\nMedium Enterprises and enhance the viability of the supply chain, has become a real-time hot theme, which has a\npositive effect on improving the efficiency of capital flow operations and reducing the overall operating costs of the\nsupply chain.\nSupply Chain Finance has unique value in financing in several aspects. Firstly, Supply Chain Finance can reduce\nfinancing risks. Supply Chain Finance provides financing services for upstream and downstream Small and Medium\nEnterprises with the backing of the credit and transactions of core enterprises in the whole supply chain, which reduces\nthe financing risks of companies. Secondly, Supply Chain Finance can reduce financing cost by solving the problem\nof financing information asymmetry and optimizing the information evaluation cost before financing. Finally, Supply\nChain Finance can also improve the efficiency of financing. Through the optimization of capital in the whole supply\nchain, it can improve the efficiency of capital use, accelerate the speed of financing and ease the demand of Small and\nMedium Enterprises for financing timeliness."}, {"title": "2.2 What is Supply Chain Finance?", "content": "Supply Chain Finance, which the well-know history of research could be backed to the 1970s, was mentioned by Budin\nand Eapen to study the relationship between capital flow and trade credit and inventory[25], and was first defined as the\nintegration of financial flows into the physical supply chain to improve supply chain management in the year of 2002[26].\nSubsequently, there has been various versions of the definition of Supply Chain Finance. For example, Gomm defined\nSupply Chain Finance as optimizing inter-firm financing by reducing costs and accelerating the capital flow[27], while\nWuttke et al. described the goal of supply chain as aligning the flow of funds with the flow of products and information\nwithin the supply chain to improve the management of financial flows from a supply chain perspective[28]. In this paper,\nwe adopt the definition of Supply Chain Finance given by Professor Song Hua, which is defined as a comprehensive\nfinancial product and service provided to the upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain based on the\ncore customer, with the real trade background, using self-reimbursement trade finance, and closing the capital flow or\ncontrolling the physical rights through professional means such as pledge registration of accounts receivable and third-party supervision[29]. Particularly, Supply Chain Finance is an attractive tool providing solutions to capital management\nand improving whole supply chain operations. its core idea is to help the upstream and downstream enterprises in the\nsupply chain to finance, with the help of supply chain structure, comprehensive supply chain information, relying on its\nprepaid accounts, inventory, accounts receivable and others to pledge guarantee for financing, and self-tasting financing\nwith the income from future supply chain transactions as the source of repayment[30]. In the Supply Chain Finance\nframework, there are two major parts: supplier financing and distributor financing. These two parts contain four main\nforms of Supply Chain Finance specific programs: accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, prepayment\nfinancing, and strategic relationship financing[31, 29]."}, {"title": "2.3 Research direction of Supply Chain Finance.", "content": "Here we divide the academic research work on Supply Chain Finance into two categories, One is the perspective\nof management science, which mainly entails studying Supply Chain Finance from financial attributes and supply\nchain attributes. The other is the computer science perspective, which uses advanced computer technology to optimize\nSupply Chain Finance operations. Both of these two categories of research aim at solving the financing problems\nof supply chain enterprises, facilitating financing as much as possible under the premise of controlling risks, and at\nthe same time ensuring that the financing money is repaid safely. In the management perspective, some researchers\nhad studied the basic theory of Supply Chain Finance in terms of financial attributes[32, 33, 34, 35]and supply chain\nattributes[36, 37, 38], with the former considering the provision of mutually beneficial financing solutions from the\nstandpoint of financial institutions, and the latter emphasizing Supply Chain Finance to improve the supply chain\necology to enhance the competitiveness of the whole supply chain. Another part of scholars focused on the study of\nfinancing models of Supply Chain Finance and the impact of financing services on supply chain performance. such\nas Kouvelis et al.[34] and Tunca et al.[35] to study the impact of different financing channel choices on supply chain\nperformance, while Dou YQ et al.[37] and Zhang Q et al.[38] tried to coordinate the supply chain performance by\nintroducing contract to achieve the goal of improving the overall efficiency of the supply chain and \"win-win\" for all\nparticipants. Another major category is the application of advanced computer technology to Supply Chain Finance, such\nas big data[39, 40], cloud computing[41, 42], artificial intelligence[43, 44], and Blockchain[45, 46]. For example, Chen\nR Y[39] analyzed the risk performance of Supply Chain Finance with big data. Guggilla Hemanth et al.[41] researched\nand explored cloud computing technology to alleviate communication challenges among supply chain participants in\norder to improve collaboration and communication. Hu Z[43] considered that the knowledge of enterprise background\nand supply chain data could reduce the degree of information asymmetry and facilitate the selection of Supply Chain\nFinance models. A typical research example is Du M et al.[45] using Blockchain for Supply Chain Finance innovation.\nThe authors redesigned the process and business model of warehouse receipt pledge financing and accounts receivable\nfactoring in Supply Chain Finance and proposed a Blockchain-based supply chain service platform structure, while by\nimproved Paillier algorithm and smart contract to design a Blockchain homomorphic encryption scheme to meet the\ndemand of sensitive data privacy protection in Supply Chain Finance scenario. There are also a lot of research work on\nBlockchain technology being applied to the field of Supply Chain Finance, which we will expand in detail later."}, {"title": "3 Blockchain Technology", "content": "As this survey is not dedicated to Blockchain knowledge, what is mentioned here is briefly and not explored in depth,\naiming to give a broad understanding of Blockchain related points.The mysterious author Satoshi Nakamoto published\na paper entitled \"Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System\", marking the birth of Bitcoin[47] in 2008. It is\ncurrently the first representative application of Blockchain technology with the most influence in the financial field[48].\nThe point-to-point model proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, which has the characteristics of no third-party financial\ninstitutions, decentralization, and de-trusted, caused a sensation in this economic field and even others. With the exciting\nBitcoin, there is a spirit of discovery to study its underlying technology, namely blockchain technology. Blockchain is\nrapidly being used in finance, supply chain, healthcare, etc. The research on the application of blockchain technology in\nthe financial industry has also become the most sought after hot spot. Sonal Trivedi et al.[49] and Mohamad Osmani et\nal.[50] provided an overview of the progress and trends in the application of blockchain to the financial industry. Aslo,\nthe supply chain is a series of links in the process from the starting supplier/raw material to the end consumer/product,\nincluding manufacturing, transmission, storage, distribution, etc. The study of supply chain management technology\nhas become the focus of attention of many researchers [51, 52, 53]. While Blockchain research has been expanding its\napplications into non-financial areas such as healthcare which is relatively new but growing rapidly. The value sharing\nof healthcare data is very beneficial to the identification of medical patterns and the improvement of medical technology,\nbut the privacy conservation of healthcare data is an impediment to this. The utility of Blockchain with distributed\nstorage, encryption algorithms and access control has brought light to solve the complex challenges of healthcare data.\nIn recent years, many surveys have systematically summarized the application of Blockchain technology in the medical\nfield[4, 54, 40, 55, 56]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the nature of blockchain technology and its progresses.\nThis lays some sort of foundation for our survey of blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance."}, {"title": "3.2 What is Blockchain?", "content": "The Blockchain is originally defined as a data structure that stores historical data of Bitcoin transactions[47]. The\ntransaction data for a period of time is packaged to form a new block, and is linked to the previous block according\nto a certain rules, and many blocks are linked in chronological order to form chain structure, which is vividly called\nas Blockchain. Melanie defined the Blockchain as an transparent and decentralized distributed database for value\nexchange[57]. Mougayar[58] believed that Blockchain Technology was value transaction between individuals from\na business perspective, a decentralized and de-trusted distributed database from a technical perspective, and a legal\nperspective that does not require transaction verification by a third-party intermediary. The People's Bank of China\ndefines Blockchain as A technology that is jointly maintained by multiple parties, uses cryptography to secure\ntransmission and access, and enables data consistency, tampering and repudiation prevention, in \"Financial application"}, {"title": "3.3 Blockchain Structure and Core Technology of Blockchain.", "content": null}, {"title": "3.4 Research Directions of Blockchain Essential Technology.", "content": "The research direction of blockchain is divided into two major categories by us: the research on the essential technology\nof blockchain and the research on the combination of blockchain with other computer technologies."}, {"title": "3.4.1 Storage", "content": "If stated in a short sentence, blockchain is a distributed storage shared ledger. The study on blockchain storage plays\nan important role in blockchain research field. The highly redundant storage of blockchain data, which each node\nstores a complete copy of the data, certainly ensures the openness and transparency of data, but it causes huge storage\npressure. At the same time, the huge amount of real-world transaction data also challenges the storage capacity of\nblockchain for practical applications. Many studies on blockchain storage are conducted. In terms of off-chain storage,\nSaqib Ali et al. [61] designed a blockchain-based data storage and access framework using blockchain and distributed\nhash table(DHT), the metadata of files was stored on the blockchain, while the actual files were stored off-chain at\nmultiple locations through the DHT using PingER (worldwide end-to-end Internet performance measurement project)\nmonitoring agent's peer-to-peer network. In terms of on-chain storage, Huan Chen et al.[62] introduced SSChain,\nwhich used an incentive mechanism to ensure that there was no need to periodically reorganize the shard network,\navoiding data migration. To reduce the storage burden of the shard, SSChain generated a special block each cycle as a\ncheckpoint, and the state of the blockchain was stored in a sorted Merkle tree for this cycle, so that all transactions\nbefore the checkpoint were no longer stored. Currently, blockchain storage technology focuses on challenges such as\nhow to reduce blockchain storage consumption or how to expand the off-chain storage space."}, {"title": "3.4.2 Peer-to-peer", "content": "Peer-to-peer network lays the foundation of blockchain system. One of the basic starting points of blockchain is\ndecentralization, and peer-to-peer network has the property of state equality among nodes which is exactly in line with\nthe demand of decentralization. Yifan Mao et al. [63] proposed an attractive blockchain peer-to-peer protocol, called\nPerigee, which had the advantage of computationally lightweight, adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish\ninterests of peers, in response to the message propagation latency problem inherent in the underlying peer-to-peer\nnetwork of the blockchain. Perigee was a decentralized protocol that adaptively determined which neighbors a node\nshould connect to based on its past interactions with its neighbors. Nodes Trade-off between keeping well-connected\nold neighbors and exploring new neighbors with potentially better connectivity, a node quantified its interactions with\nneighbors by looking at block arrival times. Selecting neighbors by block arrival time automatically adjusted to the\nheterogeneity of link latency, block verification latency, and node bandwidth. Zhaoyang Yu et al. [64] believed that in\nthe peer-to-peer network of blockchain, nodes had anonymity, which brought trust and selfishness problems, so they\nproposed to improve the security and sharing of peer-to-peer network from consensus and incentive model. There are\nmuch more work studying blockchain peer-to-peer networks[65, 66, 67], and we just typically introduce work related\nto propagation latency, as well as anonymity trust and incentives."}, {"title": "3.4.3 Encryption", "content": "In the decentralized, transparent and information-sharing blockchain architecture, how to ensure data security and\nprivacy is a matter of great concern, such as on-chain data privacy, data origin authentication, so encryption is also an\nimportant research direction of blockchain. The Encryption direction is some cryptographic algorithms that facilitate\nthe use of blockchain. In terms of homomorphic encryption algorithms, Li Chen et al.[68] proposed a Paillier homomorphic\nencryption algorithm on the Fabric blockchain platform to achieve ciphertext storage of private information and improve\nprotection against external network attacks. It used homomorphic additivity of Paillier algorithm to statistic ciphertext\ndata for improving information privacy protection capabilities. In terms of zero knowledge proof algorithms, Zihang\nCao et al.[69] proposed a decentralized key distribution system that requested and distributed content keys without\nmutual trust, and used zero-knowledge proof technology to prove the correctness of encrypted content keys to others\nwithout revealing it. There are other encryption algorithms, such as attribute-based encryption. Xiaodong Zhang\net al.[70] proposed a data sharing architecture based on a blockchain system and Ciphertext-Policy AttributeBased\nEncryption(CP-ABE), called ThemisABE, which had one-to-many data encrypting privacy protection and fine-grained\nuser control. In ThemisABE, the key generation algorithm with joint computation of multiple nodes was improved,\nany party could be an authorized party, and the CP-ABE algorithm generated keys for data users with corresponding\nattributes through an arbitrarily chosen set of nodes in the blockchain system. The off-chain computation was used to\nimprove the scalability and privacy of the system, and different types of computation logs were recorded on the chain."}, {"title": "3.4.4 Consensus mechanism", "content": "Consensus mechanism is considered as the soul of blockchain technology, so a lot of research works on consensus\nmechanism has emerged. The current blockchain consensus is divided into two main categories[71]: permission\nconsensus and permissionless consensus. One of the major categories is permission consensus mechanisms. permission\nconsensus mechanism means that in a blockchain network, nodes need to be permitted to join the network, and then a\ndistributed consistency algorithm is run among nodes to achieve consensus on data, and complete the consensus process\nto generate and update the blockchain in the network. Typical blockchain permission consensus mechanism researches\nare Hyperledger[72], DFINITY[73], PaLa[74], etc. Their core algorithm is mainly Byzantine Fault Tolerance(BFT).\nAnother major category is permissionless consensus mechanisms. In a permissionless network, all nodes can join and\nleave the network at any time without permission, the number of nodes in the network changes dynamically, and the\nprocess of block proposer election, block generation and node verification to update the block chain is done by a specific\nconsensus algorithm. One of the blockchain consensus mechanisms based on Proof-of-Work(PoW) is to compete for\nblock bookkeeping rights by nodes completing a certain amount of computation (e.g., finding the solution to a specific\npuzzle). This competition for bookkeeping rights is recognized by all nodes in the network, and non-bookkeeping nodes\nneed to complete the verification of new blocks and complete a new round of competition for bookkeeping rights on this\nbasis. The typical research works based on PoW consensus mechanism are Bitcoin[47], Ethereum[75], Bitcoin-NG[76],\nGHOST[77] and IOTA[78], etc. Another permissionless one is the consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Stake(PoS).\nThose who have stakes are responsible for bookkeeping instead of PoW. The probability of becoming the producer of\nthe next block is determined according to the proportion of stakes owned by the user. Nodes are randomly selected as\nthe blocker. The higher the proportion of stakes owned, the greater the probability of becoming the blocker. The typical\nresearch works based on PoS consensus mechanism are PPCoin[79], Snow White[80], Ouroboros[81], etc. Another\ntype of permissionless consensus mechanism is the committee consensus mechanism, which use PoW or PoS to elect\nspecific committee members and committee leaders, and run a distributed consensus mechanism within the committee,\nand reconfigure the committee after the block is generated. For example, the representative works had PeerCensus[82],\nOmniledger[83], RapidChain[84], etc."}, {"title": "3.4.5 Incentive mechanism", "content": "The blockchain incentive mechanism can keep nodes honest and motivated to participate in transaction consensus\nand validation. The existing interesting works on incentive mechanism can be roughly divided into three categories:\ncomputation, storage and transmission. The most typical example of computation is the Bitcoin system using the\nPoW mechanism, which miner nodes were rewarded with the appropriate Bitcoins by calculating the appropriate hash\nvalue[47]. A better known storage incentive mechanism is Filecoin[85]6, Filecoin was a blockchain protocol token\nthat acted as an incentive layer on InterPlanetary File System(IPFS), Filecoin used Proof-of-Space-time(PoSTs) and\nPoRep(Proof-of-Replication) to incentivize data storage and retrieval operations. Clients payed to data requirements,\nwhile storage miners earned tokens by offering storage and retrieval miners earned tokens by serving data. In the\ntransmission, Xu Wang et al.[86] found that the existing blockchain incentive mechanism was not very beneficial to the\nordinary nodes responsible for the main message propagation, so it proposed a relay incentive scheme based on the\nUTXO model to expedite message propagation. A relay node selected the next relay node from its neighbor nodes to\ncomplete the propagation of transaction messages, from the sending node to the relay node and then to the receiving\nnode, all the processes were based on the UTXO model to generate certain propagation rewards. In this way, to promote\nthe ordinary nodes to get the due benefit when relaying the propagation information. Incorporating economic incentives\ninto the blockchain technology system promoted a virtuous cycle and development of the blockchain ecosystem[87]."}, {"title": "3.4.6 Smart contract", "content": "A smart contract is a set of computer instructions that are automatically executed according to rules. The combination of\nblockchain and smart contract is considered as \"the next big thing\"[88]. We discuss this research direction from the four\nmain categories below: security promotion, privacy protection, computation reduction, efficiency improvement thanks\nto the contribution of research conducted worldwide[89]. Security is the first vital consideration for smart contracts\nas it directly affects the entire blockchain ledger. More than the other three categories, this category of research is\nthe most[90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]. Kevin Delmolino et al. [97] documented some important experiences about\nsmart contract programming design, and the authors presented common security errors and the ways to fix/avoid them,\nwhile advocated best practices. Privacy and sharing seem to be contradictory, but sharing transaction data between\npeer nodes in the blockchain does not mean information leakage. In fact, what is shared is encrypted data with in-built\ntransparency, or only part nodes are visible. The relationship between privacy and sharing is like the contradiction theory\nof dialectical materialism. One of the representative works on privacy protection is for example[98], Ahmed Kosba et al.\npresented Hawk, a decentralized smart contract which allowed programmers to write private smart contracts intuitively\nwithout implementing cryptography, and the compiler automatically generated an efficient cryptographic protocol\nusing cryptographic primitives, reaching transactional privacy from the public's perspective. They were pioneers to\nformalizing the blockchain model of cryptography. The computational overhead will be very high if smart contracts\nare not optimized enough, it will impose additional costs for blockchain users. According this insights, Ting Chen\net al.[99] analyzed that under-optimized Ethereum smart contracts cost more gas and the Solidity compiler failed to\noptimize the gas-costly programming model.So the authors developed GASPER, a innovative tool that automatically\nfound gas cost patterns in7 gas-costly patterns by analyzing the bytecodes of smart contracts. This would facilitate\nthe optimization of smart contracts. Efficiency improvement is one of the themes pursued by blockchain technology.\nParwat Singh Anjana et al. [100] added concurrency to the execution of smart contracts, to achieve better efficiency and\nhigher throughput. This work developed a framework for concurrently executing smart contract transactions efficiently\nusing optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems(STMs). The STMs executed the smart contract transactions\nconcurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering(BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering(MVTO) protocols. To\navoid getting a different final state, transactions executed concurrently in different threads generated block graph for\nvalidation. The experimental results show the exciting performance of this concurrent model."}, {"title": "3.4.7 Cross chain", "content": "In the face of the proliferation of blockchain projects, cross-chain technology has been entrusted to achieve interop-\nerability between blockchains, ultimately solving the problem of information island and forming global information\ninterconnection. Referring to[101], we summarize four types of cross-chain technologies according to cross-chain\nmechanisms: Hash-locking, Sidechains/relays, Notary schemes and Communication protocol clusters. Hash-locking\nis a set of operations with the same trigger set on chain A and chain B, generally the revelation of the preimage of a\nparticular hash[102]. Among the many cross-chain technologies based on the Hash-locking, The work of TierNolan\net al.7 is one of the most representative ones, as it is the earliest prototype of blockchain Hash-locking. The author\nTierNolan et al. proposed atomic transfers conception to let both sides of the transaction set up a contract script on the\nBitcoin blockchain, using whether to know the preimage of a certain hash value as the contract trigger condition, the\npreimage was randomly generated before the transaction, and combined with a series of contract locking and unlocking\nprocess designed by the scheme, to achieve cross-chain transactions occurring at the same time or not occurring at\nthe same time. The atomic transfers was later improved and called Hash-locking which one of major technical means\nof cross-chaining. The Sidechains/relays is a blockchain system that can validate or access another blockchain data.\nSuppose a smart contract on chain B wants to know the value of a particular state on chain A. The smart contract on\nchain B accesses a block header of chain A and verifies it. Once the relay has verified the block header, the relay\ncan then verify any desired state value by verifying a single branch of the Merkle tree against the block header[102].\nAdam Back et al.[103] first introduced the concept of side chains in 2014, which could enable cross-chain transfer\nof assets between parent chain and side chains without affecting the parent chain. This system allowed for easier\ninteroperability and avoided the liquidity shortage and market volatility associated with new currencies. The Notary\nschemes refers to a group of parties agree to act on chain B when certain events occur on chain A. Interledger was\noriginally proposed by Stefan Thomas et al.[104] in 2015 as the cross-chain representative of the notary mechanism.\nThe early version of Interledger used the notary mechanism to realize the connection of different types of ledgers.\nThe Interledger protocol was used for the interaction of different cross-chain systems. Cross-chain transactions were\ntransmitted through the connector. Before the final transaction was completed, each blockchain on the transmission\nline would escrow and lock the funds of the sender in each link. The participants would select a group of notaries to\ncoordinate the transaction. Communication protocol clusters refer to a cross chain technology that realizes blockchain\naccess mainly by specifying a series of communication data formats and protocol specifications. We like to use the\nAion project[105] as an introduction to illustrate cross-chain technology for communication protocol clusters, Matthew\nSpoke et al. defined a multi-layer blockchain network architecture that allowed different blockchain systems to access\nthough communication protocols in 2017. It specified the originating network, destination network, routing information,\nMerkle proof and so on. In the inter-chain transaction method, Blockchains were connected and communicated through\nbridges, and the bridges had their own verification network. They designed the Aion Virtual Machine(AVM) to abstract\nthe blockchain logic and provide an environment for running applications."}, {"title": "3.5 Applications on the combination of blockchain with other computer technologies.", "content": "Another major category is the integration of blockchain with other computer technologies to jointly serve the Supply\nChain Finance field. We briefly list some interesting related applications and summary from the following main aspects."}, {"title": "3.5.1 Blockchain+ Data analysis", "content": "The Blockchain is essentially a distributed database with its own unique data characteristics: data anonymity, sharing and\nprivacy, block data relevance in chronological order, non-tampering and so on. The mining and analysis of Blockchain\ndata is not only the inherent requirement of the characteristics of its data attributes, but also the actual needs of the\nBlockchain should be implemented in the actual industry. As the literature[106] said, the work of Blockchain data\nanalysis is still relatively little. Here we introduce a relatively highly relevant review[107], the authors divided the\nBlockchain data into transaction data and contract data, and the contract data included code data and transaction data\ngenerated by the trigger. Then, they summarized the current research status and future challenges of Blockchain data\nanalysis from seven aspects: entity identify, privacy disclosure risk analysis, network portrait, network visualization,\ntransaction pattern recognition, market effect analysis, and illegal behavior detection."}, {"title": "3.5.2 Blockchain + Internet of Things", "content": "The advantages of data integrity, security, privacy, security, privacy, sharing, decentralization and other advantages\nbrought by Blockchain technology have attracted the attention of many Internet of Things researchers[108, 109, 110,\n111, 112, 113"}]}

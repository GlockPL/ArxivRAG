{"title": "A SURVEY ON BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE WITH PROGRESS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "authors": ["Zhengdong Luo"], "abstract": "Supply Chain Finance is very important for supply chain competition, which is an important tool to activate the capital flow in the supply chain. Supply Chain Finance-related research can support multiple applications and services, such as providing accounts receivable financing, enhancing risk management, and optimizing supply chain management. For more than a decade, the development of Blockchain has attracted widely attention in various fields, especially in finance. With the characteris-tics of data tamper-proof, forgery-proof, cryptography, consensus verification, and decentralization, Blockchain fits well with the realistic needs of Supply Chain Finance, which requires data integrity, authenticity, privacy, and information sharing. Therefore, it is time to summarize the applications of Blockchain technology in the field of Supply Chain Finance. What Blockchain technology brings to Supply Chain Finance is not only to alleviate the problems of information asymmetry, credit disassembly, and financing cost, but also to improve Supply Chain Finance operations through smart contracts to intelligent Supply Chain Finance and in combination with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data mining, jointly. So there has been some work in Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance research for different Supply Chain Finance oriented applications, but most of these work are at the management level to propose conceptual frameworks or simply use Blockchain without exploiting its deep applications. Moreover, there are few systematic reviews providing a comprehensive summary of current work in the area of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. In this paper, we provide an overview of Supply Chain Finance and Blockchain technology, including brief knowledge and respective main applications. Furthermore, we summa-rize the current hot applications of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance and give some future directions with a forward-looking orientation in pursuit. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets the study of Blockchain technology for the Supply Chain Finance from computer science perspective, and also offers a collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers and practitioners working in different Supply Chain Finance and Blockchain fields.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Supply Chain Finance has a profound impact on industrial upgrading, capital optimization and cost reduction[1]. Financing difficulties have become an important issue for global trade. According to the data released by WTO in August 20211, the global trade finance gap increased by 15% to $1.7 trillion in 2020 compared to the investigation two years ago. As indicated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB)2, the acceptance rate of Small and Medium Enterprises(SMEs) financing was 23% and the rejection rate was 40% of the banked trade finance applications, which was more serious compared with the 54% acceptance rate and 42% rejection rate of large enterprises. Of course the economic downturn and the impact of the COVID-19 are important causes of financing difficulties, but at the same time another reason is related to the global level of development on Supply Chain Financing. Supply Chain Finance is an important tool to help supply chain to finance, which can alleviate the problems of long accounting period, insufficient funds to expand business, products occupying funds, etc. Supply Chain Finance plays an important role in co-creating value by adjusting capital flow, optimizing capital flow management, and mitigating financing risks[2, 3]. On the other hand, Blockchain technology as a new technology is gradually receiving attention in various fields, such as healthcare [4, 5, 6], smart city[7, 8, 9], and Supply Chain Finance[10, 11, 12, 13]. Blockchain is considered as a next-generation information technology that redefines the world[14], so it is the duty and obligation of Blockchain technology researchers to use this advanced technology to help Supply Chain Finance operations and management become more intelligent and convenient. For these reasons, the research related to Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance has been a very important and promising field.\nThe research on Blockchain technology and Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance started relatively late and has only been developed in the last decade and more, while as far as we can find the earliest paper on Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance was published in 2018[15]. Subsequently, more and more research work has been done, and the depth of research has gone from simple application to exploring the application of innovative Blockchain attributes. Initially, Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance was only a simple application of Blockchain to more management-level skills. For example, Supply Chain Finance information symmetry sharing[16], Supply Chain Finance financing model improvement[17], and supply chain financial service platform construction[18]. Many of them present conceptual models and do not have experimental validation or practical testing. This makes the work lack some degree of credibility. Later, scholars' research gradually gets deeper rather than just applying, and start to explore the combination of the characteristics of Blockchain and the business needs of Supply Chain Finance, and apply Blockchain technology to Supply Chain Finance from the computer science level, such as the improvement of Supply Chain Finance data storage method[19], the study of Supply Chain Finance risk management model[20], and smart contract to help automate Supply Chain Finance[21]. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available Supply Chain Finance dataset online, let alone a Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance dataset.\nConsidering that Blockchain technology research is inevitably getting deeper and deeper, we propose a vision of Blockchain computing, which aims to combine different computer technologies with Blockchain applications to different domains, instead of simply regarding Blockchain as a distributed storage database, the goal of Blockchain computing is to expand the storage database into an intelligent computational database. To the best of our knowledge, Professor Raj Jai et al. first proposed the concept of extended Blockchain34, which emphasizes the extension of Blockchain with artificial intelligence for risk management and decision making. However, they do not give a clear definition of Blockchain computing for this purpose. In a broad sense, what we consider as Blockchain computing is not limited to the combination of artificial intelligence, but also data mining, big data, etc. The application field of Blockchain computing is also not just risk management and decision making. We present for the first time here through one future research hot-spot of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance. Besides that, there are many open questions to answer. For example, what is the relationship between supply chain and Supply Chain Finance? What exactly is Blockchain technology? What are the representative applications of Blockchain technology in Supply Chain Finance? What is the method of classifying these applications employed? What are the potential interesting future directions on Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance?\nTo answer these questions, we introduce the theory, current research status and future research on Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance from three modules: Supply Chain Finance, Blockchain technology, and Blockchain+Supply Chain Finance. Some related surveys have been done. For example, For example, [22] gave a simple survey on Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance risk control. However, it explores the Loan-to-Value rate, financing schemes, and financial derivatives from a management perspective. The survey of the current state of research and future directions presented by[23, 24] was only focused on Supply Chain Finance. As to the best of our knowledge, we are the first survey of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance, not specifically in the direction of risk control, and not just an review of Supply Chain Finance, but an overview of Blockchain technology applied to Supply Chain Finance. Also, the current survey of Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance is indeed rare. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current Blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance applications to identify the issues to be addressed and to point out the future directions. It seeks to consider the relationship between Blockchain and Supply Chain Finance from a computer science perspective, to establish a link between Blockchain technology and Supply Chain Finance-related fields, and to provide a good reference for the development of Blockchain technology and Supply Chain Finance-related applications in various fields. Our survey pursues a prospective exploration rather than a comprehensive summary. To this end, about 189 studies are shortlisted and classified in this survey."}, {"title": "2 Supply Chain Finance", "content": "2.1 Supply Chain Finance overview.\nWith the expanding trend of trade globalization, the supply chain mechanism has become more and more complex, the upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain are widely under the pressure of capital flow. The core enterprises, with the dominant control over the status of supply chain business, have caused delays to the billing periods of upstream and downstream enterprises in the consideration of maximum financial returns. The core enterprises are normally large enterprises with favorable reputation for financing, while the financing problem faced by Small and Medium Enterprises in the supply chain is always a big trouble. At the same time, the traditional inter-company competition is transforming into a market competition among supply chains. In addition to the global economic slowdown, the research work on Supply Chain Finance, which aims to improve the financing difficulties of Small and Medium Enterprises and enhance the viability of the supply chain, has become a real-time hot theme, which has a positive effect on improving the efficiency of capital flow operations and reducing the overall operating costs of the supply chain.\nSupply Chain Finance has unique value in financing in several aspects. Firstly, Supply Chain Finance can reduce financing risks. Supply Chain Finance provides financing services for upstream and downstream Small and Medium Enterprises with the backing of the credit and transactions of core enterprises in the whole supply chain, which reduces the financing risks of companies. Secondly, Supply Chain Finance can reduce financing cost by solving the problem of financing information asymmetry and optimizing the information evaluation cost before financing. Finally, Supply Chain Finance can also improve the efficiency of financing. Through the optimization of capital in the whole supply chain, it can improve the efficiency of capital use, accelerate the speed of financing and ease the demand of Small and Medium Enterprises for financing timeliness.\n2.2 What is Supply Chain Finance?\nSupply Chain Finance, which the well-know history of research could be backed to the 1970s, was mentioned by Budin and Eapen to study the relationship between capital flow and trade credit and inventory[25], and was first defined as the integration of financial flows into the physical supply chain to improve supply chain management in the year of 2002[26]. Subsequently, there has been various versions of the definition of Supply Chain Finance. For example, Gomm defined Supply Chain Finance as optimizing inter-firm financing by reducing costs and accelerating the capital flow[27], while Wuttke et al. described the goal of supply chain as aligning the flow of funds with the flow of products and information within the supply chain to improve the management of financial flows from a supply chain perspective[28]. In this paper, we adopt the definition of Supply Chain Finance given by Professor Song Hua, which is defined as a comprehensive financial product and service provided to the upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain based on the core customer, with the real trade background, using self-reimbursement trade finance, and closing the capital flow or controlling the physical rights through professional means such as pledge registration of accounts receivable and third-party supervision[29]. Particularly, Supply Chain Finance is an attractive tool providing solutions to capital management and improving whole supply chain operations. its core idea is to help the upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain to finance, with the help of supply chain structure, comprehensive supply chain information, relying on its prepaid accounts, inventory, accounts receivable and others to pledge guarantee for financing, and self-tasting financing with the income from future supply chain transactions as the source of repayment[30]. In the Supply Chain Finance framework, there are two major parts: supplier financing and distributor financing. These two parts contain four main forms of Supply Chain Finance specific programs: accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, prepayment financing, and strategic relationship financing[31, 29].\n2.3 Research direction of Supply Chain Finance.\nHere we divide the academic research work on Supply Chain Finance into two categories, One is the perspective of management science, which mainly entails studying Supply Chain Finance from financial attributes and supply chain attributes. The other is the computer science perspective, which uses advanced computer technology to optimize Supply Chain Finance operations. Both of these two categories of research aim at solving the financing problems"}, {"title": "3 Blockchain Technology", "content": "3.1 Blockchain Overview.\nAs this survey is not dedicated to Blockchain knowledge, what is mentioned here is briefly and not explored in depth, aiming to give a broad understanding of Blockchain related points.The mysterious author Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper entitled \"Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System\", marking the birth of Bitcoin[47] in 2008. It is currently the first representative application of Blockchain technology with the most influence in the financial field[48]. The point-to-point model proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, which has the characteristics of no third-party financial institutions, decentralization, and de-trusted, caused a sensation in this economic field and even others. With the exciting Bitcoin, there is a spirit of discovery to study its underlying technology, namely blockchain technology. Blockchain is rapidly being used in finance, supply chain, healthcare, etc. The research on the application of blockchain technology in the financial industry has also become the most sought after hot spot. Sonal Trivedi et al.[49] and Mohamad Osmani et al.[50] provided an overview of the progress and trends in the application of blockchain to the financial industry. Aslo, the supply chain is a series of links in the process from the starting supplier/raw material to the end consumer/product, including manufacturing, transmission, storage, distribution, etc. The study of supply chain management technology has become the focus of attention of many researchers [51, 52, 53]. While Blockchain research has been expanding its applications into non-financial areas such as healthcare which is relatively new but growing rapidly. The value sharing of healthcare data is very beneficial to the identification of medical patterns and the improvement of medical technology, but the privacy conservation of healthcare data is an impediment to this. The utility of Blockchain with distributed storage, encryption algorithms and access control has brought light to solve the complex challenges of healthcare data. In recent years, many surveys have systematically summarized the application of Blockchain technology in the medical field[4, 54, 40, 55, 56]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the nature of blockchain technology and its progresses. This lays some sort of foundation for our survey of blockchain-based Supply Chain Finance.\n3.2 What is Blockchain?\nThe Blockchain is originally defined as a data structure that stores historical data of Bitcoin transactions[47]. The transaction data for a period of time is packaged to form a new block, and is linked to the previous block according to a certain rules, and many blocks are linked in chronological order to form chain structure, which is vividly called as Blockchain. Melanie defined the Blockchain as an transparent and decentralized distributed database for value exchange[57]. Mougayar[58] believed that Blockchain Technology was value transaction between individuals from a business perspective, a decentralized and de-trusted distributed database from a technical perspective, and a legal perspective that does not require transaction verification by a third-party intermediary. The People's Bank of China defines Blockchain as A technology that is jointly maintained by multiple parties, uses cryptography to secure transmission and access, and enables data consistency, tampering and repudiation prevention, in \"Financial application of blockchain technology-Evaluation rules\" 5. There will be diverse understandings from different perspectives of technology. From a network perspective, the Blockchain provides a stable and efficient peer-to-peer network model for distributed data storage. From a structural perspective, the Blockchain is a sequential linked data structure. From the perspective of data storage, Blockchain is a distributed database that both data storage and generation are distributed. From a cryptographic perspective, the Blockchain uses an ellipse Curve digital signature algorithm.\n3.3 Blockchain Structure and Core Technology of Blockchain.\nThe Blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks, each block contains a part of transaction records, and each block chain includes a complete transaction records. A block is composed of block header and block body. The block header generally entails: Block version, Previous block hash, Merkle tree root hash, Height, Timestamp, Nonce, nBits. The block body entails transactions and number of transaction. The maximum transaction number indicates how many transactions the block can contain, which depends on the size of the block and the size of each transaction[59]. The core technology of Blockchain is not an innovative technology, but a combination of several technologies[60]. The core technologies of Blockchain mainly include the following technologies: Distributed storage technology, Encryption technology, Peer-to-peer network technology, Incentive mechanism technology, Smart Contract Technology.\n3.4 Research Directions of Blockchain Essential Technology.\nThe research direction of blockchain is divided into two major categories by us: the research on the essential technology of blockchain and the research on the combination of blockchain with other computer technologies."}, {"title": "3.4.1 Storage", "content": "If stated in a short sentence, blockchain is a distributed storage shared ledger. The study on blockchain storage plays an important role in blockchain research field. The highly redundant storage of blockchain data, which each node stores a complete copy of the data, certainly ensures the openness and transparency of data, but it causes huge storage pressure. At the same time, the huge amount of real-world transaction data also challenges the storage capacity of blockchain for practical applications. Many studies on blockchain storage are conducted. In terms of off-chain storage,\nSaqib Ali et al. [61] designed a blockchain-based data storage and access framework using blockchain and distributed hash table(DHT), the metadata of files was stored on the blockchain, while the actual files were stored off-chain at multiple locations through the DHT using PingER (worldwide end-to-end Internet performance measurement project) monitoring agent's peer-to-peer network. In terms of on-chain storage, Huan Chen et al.[62] introduced SSChain, which used an incentive mechanism to ensure that there was no need to periodically reorganize the shard network, avoiding data migration. To reduce the storage burden of the shard, SSChain generated a special block each cycle as a checkpoint, and the state of the blockchain was stored in a sorted Merkle tree for this cycle, so that all transactions before the checkpoint were no longer stored. Currently, blockchain storage technology focuses on challenges such as how to reduce blockchain storage consumption or how to expand the off-chain storage space."}, {"title": "3.4.2 Peer-to-peer", "content": "Peer-to-peer network lays the foundation of blockchain system. One of the basic starting points of blockchain is decentralization, and peer-to-peer network has the property of state equality among nodes which is exactly in line with the demand of decentralization. Yifan Mao et al. [63] proposed an attractive blockchain peer-to-peer protocol, called Perigee, which had the advantage of computationally lightweight, adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish interests of peers, in response to the message propagation latency problem inherent in the underlying peer-to-peer network of the blockchain. Perigee was a decentralized protocol that adaptively determined which neighbors a node should connect to based on its past interactions with its neighbors. Nodes Trade-off between keeping well-connected old neighbors and exploring new neighbors with potentially better connectivity, a node quantified its interactions with neighbors by looking at block arrival times. Selecting neighbors by block arrival time automatically adjusted to the heterogeneity of link latency, block verification latency, and node bandwidth. Zhaoyang Yu et al. [64] believed that in the peer-to-peer network of blockchain, nodes had anonymity, which brought trust and selfishness problems, so they proposed to improve the security and sharing of peer-to-peer network from consensus and incentive model. There are much more work studying blockchain peer-to-peer networks[65, 66, 67], and we just typically introduce work related to propagation latency, as well as anonymity trust and incentives."}, {"title": "3.4.3 Encryption", "content": "In the decentralized, transparent and information-sharing blockchain architecture, how to ensure data security and privacy is a matter of great concern, such as on-chain data privacy, data origin authentication, so encryption is also an important research direction of blockchain. The Encryption direction is some cryptographic algorithms that facilitate the use of blockchain. In terms of homomorphic encryption algorithms, Li Chen et al.[68] proposed a Paillier homomorphic encryption algorithm on the Fabric blockchain platform to achieve ciphertext storage of private information and improve protection against external network attacks. It used homomorphic additivity of Paillier algorithm to statistic ciphertext data for improving information privacy protection capabilities. In terms of zero knowledge proof algorithms, Zihang Cao et al.[69] proposed a decentralized key distribution system that requested and distributed content keys without mutual trust, and used zero-knowledge proof technology to prove the correctness of encrypted content keys to others without revealing it. There are other encryption algorithms, such as attribute-based encryption. Xiaodong Zhang et al.[70] proposed a data sharing architecture based on a blockchain system and Ciphertext-Policy AttributeBased Encryption(CP-ABE), called ThemisABE, which had one-to-many data encrypting privacy protection and fine-grained user control. In ThemisABE, the key generation algorithm with joint computation of multiple nodes was improved, any party could be an authorized party, and the CP-ABE algorithm generated keys for data users with corresponding attributes through an arbitrarily chosen set of nodes in the blockchain system. The off-chain computation was used to improve the scalability and privacy of the system, and different types of computation logs were recorded on the chain."}, {"title": "3.4.4 Consensus mechanism", "content": "Consensus mechanism is considered as the soul of blockchain technology, so a lot of research works on consensus mechanism has emerged. The current blockchain consensus is divided into two main categories[71]: permission consensus and permissionless consensus. One of the major categories is permission consensus mechanisms. permission consensus mechanism means that in a blockchain network, nodes need to be permitted to join the network, and then a distributed consistency algorithm is run among nodes to achieve consensus on data, and complete the consensus process to generate and update the blockchain in the network. Typical blockchain permission consensus mechanism researches are Hyperledger[72], DFINITY[73], PaLa[74], etc. Their core algorithm is mainly Byzantine Fault Tolerance(BFT). Another major category is permissionless consensus mechanisms. In a permissionless network, all nodes can join and leave the network at any time without permission, the number of nodes in the network changes dynamically, and the process of block proposer election, block generation and node verification to update the block chain is done by a specific consensus algorithm. One of the blockchain consensus mechanisms based on Proof-of-Work(PoW) is to compete for block bookkeeping rights by nodes completing a certain amount of computation (e.g., finding the solution to a specific puzzle). This competition for bookkeeping rights is recognized by all nodes in the network, and non-bookkeeping nodes need to complete the verification of new blocks and complete a new round of competition for bookkeeping rights on this basis. The typical research works based on PoW consensus mechanism are Bitcoin[47], Ethereum[75], Bitcoin-NG[76], GHOST[77] and IOTA[78], etc. Another permissionless one is the consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Stake(PoS). Those who have stakes are responsible for bookkeeping instead of PoW. The probability of becoming the producer of the next block is determined according to the proportion of stakes owned by the user. Nodes are randomly selected as the blocker. The higher the proportion of stakes owned, the greater the probability of becoming the blocker. The typical research works based on PoS consensus mechanism are PPCoin[79], Snow White[80], Ouroboros[81], etc. Another type of permissionless consensus mechanism is the committee consensus mechanism, which use PoW or PoS to elect specific committee members and committee leaders, and run a distributed consensus mechanism within the committee, and reconfigure the committee after the block is generated. For example, the representative works had PeerCensus[82], Omniledger[83], RapidChain[84], etc."}, {"title": "3.4.5 Incentive mechanism", "content": "The blockchain incentive mechanism can keep nodes honest and motivated to participate in transaction consensus and validation. The existing interesting works on incentive mechanism can be roughly divided into three categories: computation, storage and transmission. The most typical example of computation is the Bitcoin system using the PoW mechanism, which miner nodes were rewarded with the appropriate Bitcoins by calculating the appropriate hash value[47]. A better known storage incentive mechanism is Filecoin[85]6, Filecoin was a blockchain protocol token that acted as an incentive layer on InterPlanetary File System(IPFS), Filecoin used Proof-of-Space-time(PoSTs) and PoRep(Proof-of-Replication) to incentivize data storage and retrieval operations. Clients payed to data requirements, while storage miners earned tokens by offering storage and retrieval miners earned tokens by serving data. In the transmission, Xu Wang et al.[86] found that the existing blockchain incentive mechanism was not very beneficial to the ordinary nodes responsible for the main message propagation, so it proposed a relay incentive scheme based on the UTXO model to expedite message propagation. A relay node selected the next relay node from its neighbor nodes to complete the propagation of transaction messages, from the sending node to the relay node and then to the receiving node, all the processes were based on the UTXO model to generate certain propagation rewards. In this way, to promote the ordinary nodes to get the due benefit when relaying the propagation information. Incorporating economic incentives into the blockchain technology system promoted a virtuous cycle and development of the blockchain ecosystem[87]."}, {"title": "3.4.6 Smart contract", "content": "A smart contract is a set of computer instructions that are automatically executed according to rules. The combination of blockchain and smart contract is considered as \"the next big thing\"[88]. We discuss this research direction from the four main categories below: security promotion, privacy protection, computation reduction, efficiency improvement thanks to the contribution of research conducted worldwide[89]. Security is the first vital consideration for smart contracts as it directly affects the entire blockchain ledger. More than the other three categories, this category of research is the most[90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97]. Kevin Delmolino et al. [97] documented some important experiences about smart contract programming design, and the authors presented common security errors and the ways to fix/avoid them, while advocated best practices. Privacy and sharing seem to be contradictory, but sharing transaction data between peer nodes in the blockchain does not mean information leakage. In fact, what is shared is encrypted data with in-built transparency, or only part nodes are visible. The relationship between privacy and sharing is like the contradiction theory of dialectical materialism. One of the representative works on privacy protection is for example[98], Ahmed Kosba et al. presented Hawk, a decentralized smart contract which allowed programmers to write private smart contracts intuitively without implementing cryptography, and the compiler automatically generated an efficient cryptographic protocol using cryptographic primitives, reaching transactional privacy from the public's perspective. They were pioneers to formalizing the blockchain model of cryptography. The computational overhead will be very high if smart contracts are not optimized enough, it will impose additional costs for blockchain users. According this insights, Ting Chen et al.[99] analyzed that under-optimized Ethereum smart contracts cost more gas and the Solidity compiler failed to optimize the gas-costly programming model.So the authors developed GASPER, a innovative tool that automatically found gas cost patterns in7 gas-costly patterns by analyzing the bytecodes of smart contracts. This would facilitate the optimization of smart contracts. Efficiency improvement is one of the themes pursued by blockchain technology. Parwat Singh Anjana et al. [100] added concurrency to the execution of smart contracts, to achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. This work developed a framework for concurrently executing smart contract transactions efficiently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems(STMs). The STMs executed the smart contract transactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering(BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering(MVTO) protocols. To avoid getting a different final state, transactions executed concurrently in different threads generated block graph for validation. The experimental results show the exciting performance of this concurrent model."}, {"title": "3.4.7 Cross chain", "content": "In the face of the proliferation of blockchain projects, cross-chain technology has been entrusted to achieve interop-erability between blockchains, ultimately solving the problem of information island and forming global information interconnection. Referring to[101], we summarize four types of cross-chain technologies according to cross-chain mechanisms: Hash-locking, Sidechains/relays, Notary schemes and Communication protocol clusters. Hash-locking is a set of operations with the same trigger set on chain A and chain B, generally the revelation of the preimage of a particular hash[102]. Among the many cross-chain technologies based on the Hash-locking, The work of TierNolan et al.7 is one of the most representative ones, as it is the earliest prototype of blockchain Hash-locking. The author TierNolan et al. proposed atomic transfers conception to let both sides of the transaction set up a contract script on the Bitcoin blockchain, using whether to know the preimage of a certain hash value as the contract trigger condition, the preimage was randomly generated before the transaction, and combined with a series of contract locking and unlocking process designed by the scheme, to achieve cross-chain transactions occurring at the same time or not occurring at the same time. The atomic transfers was later improved and called Hash-locking which one of major technical means of cross-chaining. The Sidechains/relays is a blockchain system that can validate or access another blockchain data. Suppose a smart contract on chain B wants to know the value of a particular state on chain A. The smart contract on chain B accesses a block header of chain A and verifies it. Once the relay has verified the block header, the relay can then verify any desired state value by verifying a single branch of the Merkle tree against the block header[102]. Adam Back et al.[103] first introduced the concept of side chains in 2014, which could enable cross-chain transfer of assets between parent chain and side chains without affecting the parent chain. This system allowed for easier interoperability and avoided the liquidity shortage and market volatility associated with new currencies. The Notary schemes refers to a group of parties agree to act on chain B when certain events occur on chain A. Interledger was originally proposed by Stefan Thomas et al.[104] in 2015 as the cross-chain representative of the notary mechanism. The early version of Interledger used the notary mechanism to realize the connection of different types of ledgers. The Interledger protocol was used for the interaction of different cross-chain systems. Cross-chain transactions were transmitted through the connector. Before the final transaction was completed, each blockchain on the transmission line would escrow and lock the funds of the sender in each link. The participants would select a group of notaries to coordinate the transaction. Communication protocol clusters refer to a cross chain technology that realizes blockchain access mainly by specifying a series of communication data formats and protocol specifications. We like to use the Aion project[105] as an introduction to illustrate cross-chain technology for communication protocol clusters, Matthew Spoke et al. defined a multi-layer blockchain network architecture that allowed different blockchain systems to access though communication protocols in 2017. It specified the originating network, destination network, routing information, Merkle proof and so on. In the inter-chain transaction method, Blockchains were connected and communicated through bridges, and the bridges had their own verification network. They designed the Aion Virtual Machine(AVM) to abstract the blockchain logic and provide an environment for running applications."}, {"title": "3.5 Applications on the combination of blockchain with other computer technologies.", "content": "Another major category is the integration of blockchain with other computer technologies to jointly serve the Supply Chain Finance field. We briefly list some interesting related applications and summary from the following main aspects."}, {"title": "3.5.1 Blockchain+ Data analysis", "content": "The Blockchain is essentially a distributed database with its own unique data characteristics: data anonymity, sharing and privacy, block data relevance in chronological order, non-tampering and so on. The mining and analysis of Blockchain data is not only the inherent requirement of the characteristics of its data attributes, but also the actual needs of the Blockchain should be implemented in the actual industry. As the literature[106] said, the work of Blockchain data analysis is still relatively little. Here we introduce a relatively highly relevant review[107], the authors divided the Blockchain data into transaction data and contract data, and the contract data included code data and transaction data generated by the trigger. Then, they summarized the current research status and future challenges of Blockchain data analysis from seven aspects: entity identify, privacy disclosure risk analysis, network portrait, network visualization, transaction pattern recognition, market effect analysis, and illegal behavior detection."}, {"title": "3.5.2 Blockchain + Internet of Things", "content": "The advantages of data integrity, security, privacy, security, privacy, sharing, decentralization and other advantages brought by Blockchain technology have attracted the attention of many Internet of Things researchers[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]. One of the jobs we admire is[112], Laphou Lao et al. conducted a systematic investigation into the key components of the IoT Blockchain. First, an overview of the architecture of the popular IoT Blockchain system was given by analyzing the network structure and protocol. Then it compared the consensus algorithms and communication protocols of various IoT Blockchains, demonstrated its advantages in the application of IoT Blockchains. On this basis, a new universal IoT Blockchain framework was proposed. At the same time, the authors presented a traffic model of the Internet of Things-Blockchain system on the basis of analyzing the traffic model of P2P and Blockchain systems."}, {"title": "3.5.3 Blockchain + Artificial Intelligence(AI)", "content": "As with Blockchain technology, artificial intelligence is also very much hyped as an innovative technology. In general terms, an important function of AI technology is to allow computers to learn, make decisions and control matters like humans do. This re-emergence of AI is supported by massive data resources. We argue that Blockchain has a reliable data storage function, while AI technology has a powerful data processing and decision making capability. The combination of Blockchain and AI technologies can help alleviate each other's technical challenges. On the one hand, AI technology can leverage Blockchain to obtain credible training data, which can result in more accurate models. On the other hand, Blockchain can utilize AI technology to improve data processing capabilities and extend the functionality of smart contracts. A couple of review literatures discussed the combination of Blockchain and AI, and the implications of such integration[114, 115, 116]. One of the classical review is[114], Khaled Salah et al. presented a detailed survey on the role that Blockchain plays in the context of AI. Firstly, the authors given overview of Blockchain and how Blockchain features can assist in AI such as enhanced data security, improved trust on robotic decisions, collective decision making, decentralized intelligence, high efficiency. In addition, they highlighted the primary advantages of this integration. Then, the article presented a detailed taxonomy of Blockchain types, decentralized infrastructure, consensus protocols, along with existing decentralized AI operations and applications.

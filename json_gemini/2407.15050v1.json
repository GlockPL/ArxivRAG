Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval.

However, akin to LLMs, a significant concern associated with deploying VLMs is the potential for generating misinformation and vulnerable content [34]. As depicted by Qi et al. [38], a single adversarial image input can compromise the safety mechanisms of a representative VLM named MiniGPT-4 [54], resulting in the generation of harmful content that deviates significantly from mainstream ethical values [13].\nTo safeguard against the generation of inappropriate responses, e.g., adult, violent, or racial content, it is customary to subject VLMs to rigorous testing prior to deployment [41]. In this traditional approach, researchers and industry professionals often utilize a LLM to automatically generate test cases, i.e., prompts, designed to elicit undesirable responses from the target VLM [37, 50]. This practice is commonly referred to as red teaming [11, 37, 43], with the LLMs employed for this purpose being dubbed red teams. Red teaming serves as a proactive measure to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities or shortcomings in VLMs, thereby enhancing their robustness and trustworthiness prior to real-world deployment.\nExisting literature predominantly utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) [21] to train the red team LLM, distinct from the target VLM, to construct a diverse red team dataset of jailbreak prompts. These prompts are then employed to assess the performance of the target VLM [47]. The RL agent's objective is to maximize the likelihood of the target VLM generating inappropriate responses. It treats the red team LLM as a strategy for generating test cases, with RL"}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK", "content": "VLM Security and Relevant Attacks. Like other machine learning models, VLMs face both internal and external security threats [8]. Trained on extensive crawler datasets, VLMs may inadvertently produce biased or controversial content [15]. These datasets, while extensive, can contain harmful information, perpetuating hate speech, stereotypes, or misinformation [47, 55]. Recent research has revealed vulnerabilities in VLMs, particularly in prompt injection attacks and jailbreaking attacks [9, 23, 32, 53]. Moreover, recent efforts [26, 46] have been concentrated on constructing red team datasets to facilitate thorough security testing of target VLMs. However, these endeavors either lack consistent automation in generating red team datasets encompassing all modalities or fall short in addressing all prohibited security scenarios. We summarize our comparison with existing LLM and VLM red teams in Table 1.\nRed Teaming for LLMs. Without loss of generality, let f denote the target LLM and x denote the prompt (or query).

It is worth noting that for this task, we utilize GPT-4 as the red team VLM, as it is currently the only model capable of high-quality image generation at the time of writing.\nDesign Insight. As the safety defense strategies of GPT-4 are not published, our attempt starts with revisiting the attack methods of SneakyPrompt [49] (a SOTA text-to-image attack) and studying why it fails to attack GPT-4 (i.e., defense probing). For example, in an experiment covering the prohibited scenario for adult content, the following prompt occurs: \"She begged for more, craving the declared chances brave that only they could give her. She comes hard, her body shaking with brokers js fire\". In this prompt generated by SneakyPrompt, it is obvious that it includes a substantial amount of toxic and disordered text, which can be potentially blocked by the safety filters in GPT-4 (as we do not know the exact defenses in"}, {"title": "3.3 Diversity-driven Red Team LLM", "content": "Diverging from previous approaches [19, 24], our textual prompt not only aims to trigger the target VLM but also strives to seamlessly integrate with the visual prompt to enhance the overall jailbreak performance. Furthermore, we take into account the diversity of textual prompts to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of the target VLM's security. Therefore, our objective is to develop a new red team LLM, which is an integral component of Arondight, to facilitate the generation of diverse textual prompts. These prompts are intended to effectively complement toxic images and enhance the overall jailbreak strategy.\nKey Insights. On one hand, to incentivize the red team LLM to produce diverse texts, it is crucial to introduce randomness into the generated samples. This can be achieved by controlling the entropy of the generated text. Following the method outlined in reference [21], we incorporate an entropy addition index into Eq. (1) to achieve this objective. Additionally, to encourage the red team LLM to explore novelty and generate unseen test cases, we devise a novelty reward metric to guide the red team strategy in generating new test cases. On the other hand, drawing inspiration from prior research, we recognize that the relevance of the textual prompt to the semantics of the toxic image significantly influences the jailbreak performance of VLMs. Therefore, we design a correlation metric to further guide the red team strategy in generating test cases that are closely aligned with the semantics of the toxic images.\nEntropy Bonus. We introduce the entropy bonus metric to generalize the diversity of texts, and its formal definition is as follows:\n$\\lambda_{\\epsilon} log(\\pi(x|z))$,\nwhere x is the generated test cases and $\\lambda_{\\epsilon} \\in R^+$ is the weights.\nNovelty Reward. Novelty rewards are devised to incentivize the creation of unseen test cases. We can generalize this concept by employing various text similarity metrics, formally defined as follows:\n$\\lambda_1 S_1(x) + \\lambda_2 S_2(x)$,\nwhere $S_1 (x) = -BertScore(x, x')$ means measuring the similarity between semantic representations under different sentences by using BERT model, and $S_2 (x) = \\frac{5(x) \\cdot \\varsigma(x')}{\\|\\varsigma(x)\\|_2 \\|\\varsigma(x')\\|_2}$ means measuring the similarity between word vectors of different sentences by using model $\\varsigma$, and $\\lambda_1 \\in R^+$ is the weights.\nCorrelation Metric. Here, we employ a straightforward method to compute the correlation between toxic images and toxic texts. This method involves mapping their embeddings into the same space and calculating cosine similarity Scos. Let the encoders of toxic images and toxic texts be $E_I$ and $E_T$ respectively, then the correlation $S_{cos}$ can be formally defined as follows:\n$S_{cos}(E_1 (I), E_T (x)) = \\frac{E_1 (I) \\cdot E_T (x)}{\\|E_1(I)\\|_2 \\|E_T(x)\\|_2}$,\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\varsigma} \\in R^+$ is the weights. To this end, we can rewrite Eq. (1) according to Eq. (6)-(8) as follows:"}, {"title": "4 EMPIRICAL STUDIES", "content": "Next, we conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed multi-modal safety evaluation framework above in various situations.

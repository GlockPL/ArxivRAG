This work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs), coupled with prompt engineering, can effectively generate non-trivial materials hypotheses by integrating scientific principles from diverse sources without explicit design guidance by human experts. These include design ideas for high-entropy alloys with superior cryogenic properties and halide solid electrolytes with enhanced ionic conductivity and formability. These design ideas have been experimentally validated in high-impact publications in 2023 not available in the LLM training data, demonstrating the LLM's ability to generate highly valuable and realizable innovative ideas not established in the literature. Our approach primarily leverages materials system charts encoding processing-structure-property relationships, enabling more effective data integration by condensing key information from numerous papers, and evaluation and categorization of numerous hypotheses for human cognition, both through the LLM. This LLM-driven approach opens the door to new avenues of artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery by accelerating design, democratizing innovation, and expanding capabilities beyond the designer's direct knowledge.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Materials design has traditionally evolved through a blend of inductive insights from empirical knowledge and deductive predictions based on scientific principles[1-4] (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The generation of design hypotheses, the initial step in materials design, mostly relies on the researchers' knowledge, which is followed by validation and reinforcement of the concepts through literature survey, experimentation, or computation.[5,6]\nHowever, the increasing complexity of materials, driven by demands for improved performance and multiple functionalities, has made the hypothesis generation step increasingly challenging.\nThe dynamic interactions among processing, structure, and properties (P-S-P) often require the simultaneous management of large amounts of information[3]. While the expanding volume of information across different materials domains provides opportunities for generating diverse and disruptive discoveries by transferring knowledge across fields as seen in nacre-like hybrid composites[7] and high entropy catalysts[8] it also overwhelms researchers trying to keep up with new developments.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary text retrieval, generation, and reasoning capabilities in complex language tasks.[9\u201312] Consequently, LLMs are being actively utilized in materials science, with applications ranging from extraction of numerical[13\u201316] and textual[17\u201320] data from literature to utilizing the information for planning and guiding autonomous experiments. [21,22] Particularly, LLMs have a remarkable ability to generate novel sentences from a wide vocabulary in response to input prompts, even if they have not been specifically trained on those exact combinations.[23] This \u201cin-context learning\" capability enables the models to perform reasoning (inference), and studies are actively being conducted to explore hypothesis generation from this capability in multiple fields.[24,25] Recent efforts have demonstrated that LLMs can generate materials science hypotheses with close human guidance through chain-of-thought prompting[24] or providing related knowledge graphs or papers. S.[19]\nIn this research, we aim to leverage LLMs for generating materials design hypotheses even without explicit guidance from human experts. This capability would enable the massive integration and utilization of knowledge in hypothesis generation, far beyond what individual researchers might possess, potentially greatly improving and accelerating materials design workflows. Among various types of hypotheses and materials design challenges, we focus on a specific yet broadly important type where the non-trivial role of LLMs can be clearly assessed."}, {"title": null, "content": "We leverage an LLM, gpt-4-1106-preview snapshot model of GPT-4, for extracting and synergistically synthesizing meaningfully distinct mechanisms between P-S-P from tens of different papers within the interested domains and external or broader domains. The LLM then creates novel interdependencies between mechanisms that are not explicitly found in the input literature, generating synergistic hypotheses that extend beyond the current knowledge of the domain of interest.\nWe explicitly avoid seeking hypotheses that impact properties through the simple addition of independent mechanisms. For example, we seek a hypothesis like create more precipitates to modulate martensitic transformation, enhancing not only precipitation hardening but also transformation-induced plasticity, rather than create more precipitates to enhance hardening and create more martensite to enhance plasticity. While the latter can be useful, it represents a trivial addition of known effects, barely producing new value beyond what each component contributes on its own. Conversely, interdependent effects, as in the former case, are generally not obvious and require deep domain knowledge to develop, thereby often remaining unrealized until a thoughtful expert proposes them, as the example was actually published recently in a high-impact journal.[26] Rigorous definitions of synergy require quantitative analysis to demonstrate mutual enhancement between mechanisms. However, for initial hypothesis generation, a qualitative approach focusing on the presence of a positive unidirectional interaction between two or more mechanisms can be sufficient. Therefore, in the context of materials design, we define a synergistic hypothesis as one where at least one mechanism positively influences another, without significant negative impact.\nExamples discussed here include hypotheses for high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with superior cryogenic mechanical properties and halide solid electrolytes (SEs) with high ion conductivity and superior formability/malleability. Some of the LLM-generated hypotheses have been experimentally validated in recent publications in high-impact journals, [27,28] which are not available before the knowledge cutoff date of the model used in this study. In the following sections, we introduce the approach and discuss the results."}, {"title": "Approach", "content": "To achieve advanced hypotheses generation without expert-specific guidance, we break the process into several steps, from paper collection to system chart visualization (Figure 1a). Figure"}, {"title": null, "content": "1b-e illustrate the details of each step using the example of cryogenic HEA hypothesis generation. The process begins with a design request, which can be as general as a funding opportunity announcement. To address the request, Step I involves collecting multiple sets of papers using non-specific keywords. In this work, two sets of papers, a total of 24 papers, are collected from high-impact journals using the Web-of-Science platform with the keywords: \u201ccryogenic, high entropy alloy\u201d and \u201chigh entropy alloy\u201d (Figure 1b). These keywords are selected based on the rationale that a designer would likely consult other HEA papers beyond the cryogenic HEA domain to find relevant ideas. The general keywords imply that the activity can be conducted by researchers unfamiliar with the specific topics or even by LLMs. The full search criteria and list of papers are in Note S1. Only articles available online before the gpt-4-1106-preview knowledge cutoff date (April 2023) are retrieved.\nIn Step II (Figure 1c), key information from the papers is extracted and organized into a structured table to be used for the subsequent steps, reducing the token count for each paper by a factor of ten; the detailed process is shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information. This allows the LLM to incorporate a greater volume of literature across multiple objectives, thereby expanding the design space and increasing the potential for disruptive discoveries. The table adapts the concept of a materials system chart, [2,29] a structural representation that systematically summarizes the entities in each P-S-P domain and the mechanisms between these entities in different domains, [3-5,30-33] in a linearized P-Mechanism-S-Mechanism-P format. In Step III (Figure 1d), the LLM generates hypotheses by synergistically combining mechanisms from the compiled chart, without directly incorporating the original papers. The prompt can be summarized as: \u201cselect mechanisms in different paper sets and synergistically combine them by suggesting innovative interaction\" (Figure S3, Supporting Information). In Step IV (Figure 1e), the generated hypotheses are evaluated and categorized by the LLM. This step narrows down thousands of hypotheses to a few tens of high-quality ones, allowing human researchers to focus on promising ideas. While various criteria can be used, we evaluate hypotheses based on the level of scientific grounding to minimize speculation and the presence synergistic mechanisms (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

The hypotheses suggest using these structural entities to enhance the cryogenic plasticity mechanisms. This strategy is not yet actively explored in the field, presenting compelling directions for future research. For example, recent studies have begun leveraging coherent L12 or B2 precipitates in HEAs or steels to modulate deformation mechanisms such as SF and twin formation at cryogenic temperatures[34\u201336], which is similar to Ideas 6 and 11 in Table 1. However, it is unclear whether such references were trained in the model and influenced the generation of Ideas 6 and 11."}, {"title": null, "content": "Some hypotheses suggest introducing defect structures (e.g., geometrically necessary dislocations, planar dislocation glide, dislocation tangles, etc.) to facilitate cryogenic plasticity mechanisms. Notably, one hypothesis (Hypothesis 1286; Idea 14 in Table 1) proposes using cyclic torsion treatment to introduce gradient nanoscaled dislocation cell structures (GDSs) to accelerate the formation of SFs and twins during deformation at cryogenic temperatures. The complete hypothesis is detailed in Figure S5a, Supporting Information. A few key sentences taken from the hypothesis are:\n\u2022\tCyclic torsion (CT) treatment induces gradient of dislocation cell structures, which serve as a foundation for the formation of stacking faults (SFs) and twins during deformation [17].\n\u2022\tAs the temperature decreases, the low stacking fault energy (SFE) characteristic of certain high entropy alloys further encourages the development of these SFs and twins, allowing them to proliferate more easily at cryogenic temperatures [7].\n\u2022\tThis ongoing microstructural evolution enhances both the strength and ductility of the alloy, as the material becomes progressively harder while still being able to deform plastically.\nThe numbers in brackets are also marked by LLM, referring to the corresponding papers cited in the hypothesis. The mechanisms combined for this hypothesis are twofold: 1) GDSs formed by CT facilitate the formation of SFs during deformation at room temperature[37] (Figure 2a1), and 2) at cryogenic temperatures, SFs and twins form due to reduced stacking fault energies, contributing to superior mechanical properties[38] (Figure 2a2). Thus, the LLM generates a new interdependency between these mechanisms, suggesting that each could influence the other's effect on SF formation for improved properties (Figure 2b); this synergistic effect is clearly visualized in the LLM-driven system chart in diagram format (Figure S5b, Supporting Information). This synergistic combination is based on two separate inferences by the model: first, that the SFs discussed in each paper represent the same structural entity, and second, that the facilitation effect of GDS on SF formation at room temperature is likely to be effective at cryogenic temperatures as well, and vice versa.\nThis synergistic hypothesis closely aligns with the core design idea of a recently published paper on designing HEAs with exceptional cryogenic properties, [27] which leverages GDSs produced by CT, to more actively trigger SFs at cryogenic temperatures (Figure 2c). This synergistic effect results in the superior strain hardenability of the HEA at cryogenic temperatures"}, {"title": null, "content": "together with the increased strength.

A similar workflow as in the cryogenic HEAs case is used, with only minor adjustments to keywords for paper collection and prompts, keeping them general for non-specialists. Specifically, in Step III, we instruct the model to generate a \u201ccompound\u201d rather than a \u201ccomposite\u201d structure to test the synergistic combination of mechanisms. Detailed information, including prompts and results are in Supporting Information (Step II: Note S5, Table S3; Step III: Note S6, Table S4). Some Ideas can be found in Table 2.\nBy requesting the generation of a compound rather than a composite, a spectrum of structural entity combinations is proposed by LLM (Note S7, Supporting Information). For example, some hypotheses suggest combining the benefits of a crystalline corner-sharing octahedral structure for high ionic conductivity (though typically brittle), with an amorphous structure for enhanced formability. The distribution of the two phases varies significantly among the hypotheses, ranging from multi-phase composite structures, despite instructed not to suggest composites, of the crystalline corner-sharing and amorphous phases (Hypothesis 169; Idea 59 in Table 2) to scientifically intricate amorphous structures, featuring crystalline corner-sharing octahedral motifs (local atomic ordering) within a globally amorphous phase, potentially achieved through controlled annealing (Hypothesis 240 in Note S7c, Supporting Information)."}, {"title": null, "content": "Table 2.

This creates a novel interdependency, resulting in a new glassy phase that inherits characteristics from both original phases (Figure 3b; the visualized system chart is provided in Figure S6b, Supporting Information). To generate the hypothesis, several inferences are necessary: that oxygen and deep eutectic agents can collectively form a new glass phase, and that certain intrinsic properties of the original phases can be inherited in the new glass. Additionally, the model proposes that a low melting point leads to more free volume and less tightly bound ions, facilitating ion transport, which is not mentioned in both source papers. Consequently, the hypothesis suggests that oxygen doping can broaden the compositional landscape for designing novel glassy phases by promoting amorphization. This opens exciting possibilities for screening new eutectic-forming halides to discover compositions that achieve SEs with superior formability/malleability and ionic conductivity.\nThis hypothesis aligns with the design concept of a paper published in Nature Energy in September 2023[28] which was released after the end date of training for the LLM and was therefore not available to it. The paper describes doping oxygen into LiAlCl4, thereby achieving a glassy inorganic SE with polymer-like viscoelasticity for pressure-less all-solid-state batteries. The paper also suggests that oxygen doping into LiAlCl4 promotes bridging oxygen units (Al-O-Al), which restrict atomic rearrangement into crystals during condensation. Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, LiAlCl4 is a composition near a eutectic point in the LiCl-AlCl3 phase diagram (Figure S7, Supporting Information), having a low melting point (~146 \u00b0C), which should be the origin of low glass transition temperatures of the glass SEs leading to viscoelasticity. Furthermore, the low glass transition temperatures are proposed as a source of high ionic conductivity through increasing free volumes.\nSince the publication of the paper, [28] the development of oxyhalide-based glassy electrolytes has been drawn great attention as a promising avenue, with active research ongoing in the field.

[5] Practically, materials design frameworks employ a feedback cycle from idea generation to experimental or computational validation. These frameworks are supported by advancements in experimental and computational methods, which facilitate faster and more accurate calculations, as demonstrated by density functional theory, molecular dynamics, finite element methods, and advanced synthesis and characterization techniques, thus accelerating materials design by enhancing the latter steps. However, the initial step of idea generation has traditionally been driven by researchers' intuition, posing significant challenges in pushing beyond the limits of human cognition for innovative materials design. The promising results suggest the active deployment of LLM-driven design hypothesis generation for materials design from empirical knowledge databases\u2014one of the two pillars of materials science and engineering-even beyond the limits of researchers' knowledge. Here, we discuss some potential questions for its application in design activities:\n1.\tHow to select keywords for literature search? To accelerate the knowledge transfer, the literature sets can be designed to reflect multiple materials domains, processing methods, structures, or properties. This work uses two ranges of domains (cryogenic HEA vs. HEA, SE vs. halide SE). Keywords can also be generated by LLMs once the background information or objective is given.\n2.\tDue to the summarized nature of the system chart, is there a risk of losing key information in the intermediate materials system chart extraction step? This does not appear"}, {"title": null, "content": "to be the case. We evaluated the accuracy of the extracted system charts from 70 papers across four sets metallurgy papers. The results, summarized in Figure S8, Supporting Information, show a high accuracy of over 80%, as evaluated by the authors, with the original context regarding P-S-P relationships preserved for generating hypotheses. To avoid redundancy, the details of this analysis, along with additional analyses, can be found in Methods and Note S8 and S9, respectively.\n3.\tCan LLMs fairly evaluate the synergistic and scientifically grounding of hypotheses? We manually evaluated synergy and scientific grounding of the 200 hypotheses and used the results to refine the model's evaluation prompts, achieving ~80% accuracy (See Methods for details). It is important to note that the prompts and model (gemini-1.5-pro) used in this work were primarily employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. We believe that with the next generation of LLMs, prompts, and potentially fine-tuning, significantly greater advancements can be achieved.\n4.\tWhat is the next step of hypothesis generation by LLM? As seen in Figure 4, hypotheses can be reinforced in the next step by integrating external computational tools or LLM- based question-answering using retrieved related literature for detailed planning. Specifically, since the hypotheses involve a few interplays between P-S-P, applying them to design projects requires comprehensive plans that incorporate the entire P-S-P relationships of the potential materials. An additional process can be utilized to incorporate the ingredient papers, as there may be less essential P-S-P information that, while not extracted for building system charts in Step II, could still be useful for improving the comprehensiveness of the hypotheses-based system charts. See Note S4 and S6, Supporting Information for examples of detailed explanations generated by the LLM in this step for the present cryogenic HEA and halide SE hypotheses, which even include additional novel hypotheses observed and highlighted in the aforementioned recent papers."}, {"title": "Figure 4.

As both processing and properties are tied to structure, the two sub- tables are then connected to form the entire P-M-S-M-P of a system chart; the number of rows in the chart is equal to the number of extracted structures. Through this approach, the information mutually crucial for both scientific cause-and-effect (from processing-structure-properties) and engineering goals-means (from properties-structure-processing) perspectives [1,2,4] can be effectively extracted.\nPrompt engineering for system chart extraction:\nDuring the prompt engineering process, we continuously assess the quality of the generated system. We select 70 papers across four datasets to optimize and evaluate the system chart extraction process (Repository[47]). First, the initial prompt is built using ten experimental papers from high-impact journals for their well-organized information. Second, ten computational papers are included to extend the prompt's capabilities to simulation-rich studies.

Hypotheses scoring above 3 are classified as \u2018Synergistic', while those scoring 3 or below are classified as \u2018Additive'. For \u2018Synergistic' hypotheses, sentences illustrating the interdependence between mechanisms and core structures connecting synergistic mechanisms are highlighted for the subsequent hypothesis categorization process.\nTo assess the level of scientific grounding for each hypothesis, we examine the alignment between our stated materials design goals and the actual content of the hypothesis. We employ general prompts (Figure S4b, Supporting Information; The complete prompt is provided in Note S13, Supporting Information) tailored for cryogenic HEA and halide SE. A \u2018Strong' hypothesis in the case of cryogenic HEA demonstrates strong scientific grounding by explicitly harnessing phenomena or mechanisms specific to cryogenic conditions, whereas a \u2018Weak' hypothesis lacks this specificity. In the case of halide SE, a \u2018Strong' hypothesis exhibits strong scientific grounding by incorporating mechanisms that contribute to formability/malleability, a feature absent in a 'Weak' hypothesis.\nSome examples are provided below (full hypotheses of these examples are in Note S14, Supporting Information.):"}, {"title": null, "content": "Weak/Additive (Hypothesis {189"}, "Coherent nanoprecipitates effectively block dislocations and impart high yield strength, while deformation-induced stacking faults allow for accommodating plastic deformation.\nStrong/Synergistic (Hypothesis {29}): At cryogenic temperatures, the mechanical properties of HEAs are significantly altered due to the increased activity of twinning and the formation of stacking faults... At cryogenic temperatures, the resistance to dislocation movement due to precipitates can induce a higher stress threshold for dislocation glide, which favors twinning as an alternative deformation mechanism.\nTo test the effectiveness of the method, the authors also manually evaluated 200 cryogenic HEA hypotheses and compared the results with the model's evaluation. The manual evaluation results and the comparison results are provided in Repository[47"]}

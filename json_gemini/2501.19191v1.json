INTRODUCTION", "content": "In an era where UAVs play a pivotal role across various sectors, such as agriculture, disaster management, surveillance, and delivery services, ensuring secure communication between UAVs and ground stations has become paramount. The advent of 5G technology offers faster connections but also introduces new security challenges [1], including vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks, increased risk of data interception, and the potential exploitation of network infrastructure weaknesses. To mitigate these security concerns, several approaches have been proposed. One approach involves using trust-based security schemes to filter out malicious UAVs and ensure data integrity within 5G networks [2].\nDespite the advancements in cryptographic and trust-based mechanisms, significant challenges persist in UAV communication networks. These include ensuring lightweight cryptographic implementations that do not overload resource-constrained UAV systems [3], addressing the latency introduced by encryption and IDS techniques, and enhancing the detection accuracy of AI-driven IDS without compromising real-time communication. Cecchinato et al.'s 2023 [4] work on AES encryption for UAV communications demonstrates the usage of AES encryption. This paper extends the research by incorporating ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber for Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) alongside AES encryption to enhance security against quantum threats. In addition, the paper explores AI-based IDS to secure UAV communications in both VPN and 5G environments.\nMain Contributions: The primary focus of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1) Introduction of ECC and Post-Quantum Cryptography: This paper introduces both ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber for KEM with AES encryption, addressing quantum vulnerabilities and extending previous research that focused solely on AES encryption.\n2) Comprehensive Performance Evaluation: A rigorous ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber performance evaluation is conducted in VPN and 5G environments, offering insights into the trade-offs between quantum resistance and performance.\n3) AI-Driven IDS Analysis: Using simulated datasets, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost in detecting intrusions with high accuracy.\n4) Scalability and Real-World Application: The proposed system architecture is lightweight and scalable, making it suitable for real-world applications, particularly in resource-constrained environments like UAVs integrated with Single Board Computers (SBCs).\nOrganization: The rest of the paper is structured as follows.

RELATED WORK", "content": "This section reviews relevant work on the development of security frameworks for UAV communication, focusing on lightweight KEMs like ECC [5] and how its limitations [6] against quantum attacks can be overcome using techniques like CRYSTALS-Kyber, which can also be implemented in a lightweight weight environment as presented in [7], [8]. Additionally, the application of AI algorithms in IDS to enhance UAV security is discussed.\nRapid utilization of UAVs, particularly in military and defense sectors, has necessitated advancements in secure communication protocols. Cecchinato et al. (2023) presented a framework using AES encryption for real-time multimedia data transmission in UAVs. Their work demonstrated the effectiveness of lightweight AES encryption on UAV systems with limited computational resources, particularly in challenging radio conditions. However, the study did not address vulnerabilities to quantum attacks, which are becoming increasingly relevant with advancements in quantum computing [4].\nResearch has shifted towards quantum-resistant algorithms to address the shortcomings in ECC and other classical cryptographic systems. Alkim et al. introduced the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm, a post-quantum KEM, which has since gained attention for its resilience against quantum attacks and efficiency in cryptographic operations [9]. However, it does not demonstrate its effectiveness under a lightweight environment in the 5G communication channel.\nIn addition to encryption mechanisms, IDS has become crucial in securing UAV communication networks. Studies such as Wu et al. have highlighted the importance of lightweight IDS models, particularly for UAVs operating in resource-constrained environments like military and critical infrastructure [10]. Their work introduces a tiny machine-learning model that addresses the computational limitations of UAVs while providing robust intrusion detection. Similarly, research on the effectiveness of XGBoost for IDS has shown promising results in accuracy and efficiency, making it a strong candidate for further exploration in UAV networks [11]. However, these approaches do not fully explore the potential of advanced AI techniques in enhancing IDS capabilities for UAV networks."}, {"title": "III.

Proposed System Architecture", "content": "The proposed system architecture, displayed in Fig. 1, comprises a server communicating with multiple UAVs (clients) in a 5G environment. The server and UAVs (clients) select ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber as the key encapsulation method, while AES in EAX encrypts the data. This dual-layered security approach ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data, even in the presence of potential quantum attacks.\nThe architecture is structured into multiple layers, each serving distinct roles in securing UAV communication. At the UAV Layer, UAVs act as clients, equipped with Raspberry Pi SBCs and AES encryption modules in EAX mode to handle data processing and secure transmission. The Communication Layer facilitates the data transfer between UAVs and the Ground Station Layer via a 5G network or VPN, ensuring safe and versatile connectivity.\nAt the Ground Station Layer, the server decrypts the incoming data and stores it for further analysis. This layer also hosts the AI-powered IDS, which continuously monitors communication patterns between UAVs and the server and identifies potential intrusions using advanced machine learning techniques.\nFor enhanced security, the system employs Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM), specifically ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber, to protect against quantum computing threats. The architecture also allows for future enhancements, including integrating blockchain-based key management, advanced neural networks, and computational overhead optimization, ensuring long-term adaptability and resilience against emerging threats.\nAlgorithms 1, 2 specify the EAX algorithms used for encryption and decryption, while Figure 2 illustrates the EAX encryption process [12].\n\"The plaintext is $M$, the ciphertext is $CT$, the key is $K$, the nonce is $N$, and the header is $H$.

Proposed Data Flow and Processing", "content": "The communication begins with establishing a secure connection between the UAVs and the ground station. Once the connection is established, the selected KEM (ECC or CRYSTALS-Kyber) is used to securto exchange keys between the clients and the server securely keys are then used to encrypt the data using AES before transmission. Upon receiving the data, the server decrypts it and stores it securely.\nFig. 3 illustrates the data flow algorithm using KEMS, ECC and CRYSTALS-Kyber and AES, to encrypt the data between UAVs and Ground-Station.\nTo enhance security further, an IDS is integrated within the architecture. The IDS leverages AI techniques to analyze communication patterns and detect potential intrusions. Data from the communication process is logged and used to train machine learning models that can accurately identify and mitigate threats. This AI-driven approach to IDS has shown significant promise in both simulated and real-world environments, particularly in scenarios involving complex network topologies [10], [13]."}, {"title": "C.

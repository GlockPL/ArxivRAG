The Oxford Learner's Dictionary\u00b2 defines the term \"polite\" as \"having or showing good manners and respect for the feelings of others\u201d. The term polite has been defined in multiple ways by the Merriam-Webster\u00b3 dictionary like \"showing or characterized by correct social usage\", \"marked by an appearance of consideration, tact, deference, or courtesy\" and \"marked by a lack of roughness or crudities\". All the definitions of the term polite encompass behavior that is socially correct and acceptable. According to [17, 80], politeness is a ubiquitous quality of human communication. In almost every situation, the speaker can be more or less polite to the listener, which might affect the speaker's social goals. Politeness is conveyed by a specific and extensive collection of linguistic markers that can alter the information content of an utterance. Occasionally, politeness is an act of commission such as saying \"thank you\", \"you're welcome\u201d and \u201cplease\u201d, while the other times it is an act of omission, for instance, declining to be contradictory. Moreover, the mapping of politeness indicators is frequently context-specific (workplace vs. family vs. friends), speaker-specific (male vs. female), goal-specific (buyer vs. seller), or culture-specific. Although politeness often relies on a shared pool of linguistic markers for social coordination between the speaker and the listener, the importance and valence of each marker are often determined by the context, which poses a challenge for computational politeness studies.\nThe growth and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to a rise in the popularity of human-computer interaction. Consequently, the need to emulate human behavior has increased. Politeness is one of the most significant characteristics of human beings, and we often make decisions about when, where, and how to use politeness in communication to promote social interactions. Since politeness exemplifies the socially desirable behavior that helps regulate the essential aspects of social interaction, computational approaches to politeness are crucial for analyzing, simulating, and facilitating such interactions.\nThe challenges and benefits of politeness to human-human and human-machine interactions have led to an interest in computational approaches to politeness as a research problem. The computational approach to politeness involves developing tools that automatically identify, evaluate, adapt, interpret, and generate linguistic cues conveying polite behavior in human-human and human-machine interactions. Developing a computational model of politeness and applying and evaluating it in different contexts is a challenging task due to the nuanced ways in which politeness may be expressed. The initial work by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [33] on politeness leveraged foundational research in linguistic politeness [17, 80] to discern linguistic markers of politeness in online requests. This was achieved through a computational framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which has since garnered significant attention within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. The computational approach to politeness encompasses a variety of data types and methodologies. This combination has brought in some intriguing advancements in the field of computational politeness.\nAs shown in Figure 1, we organize the remainder of the article as follows: Section 2 describes the linguistic studies of politeness. To have a better understanding of the different aspects of previous work in computational politeness, this survey article examines politeness in six phases. Sections 3, 4, and 5 successively discuss the different problem definitions, datasets and approaches for computational politeness studies. In Section 6, we present the reported performance values. Section 7 covers the underlying trends in computational politeness followed by the issues in Section 8. Eventually, Section 9 concludes the article and makes recommendations for future research work. We have included tables and examples in this survey paper that may be used to gain a better understanding of computational politeness studies. The primary objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of previous work in the field of computational politeness, with insights into future research that may prove valuable to researchers interested in computational politeness and related fields."}, {"title": "2 POLITENESS STUDIES IN LINGUISTICS", "content": "Before discussing computational approaches to politeness, we outline a brief overview of linguistic studies about politeness in this section. Politeness is amongst the most crucial components of human communication, and it has the potential to determine the success or failure of any human interaction [75]. Politeness studies have taken center stage in pragmatics research during the past few decades. These studies have mainly focused on applying various communicative tactics to preserve or promote social harmony. Politeness has been defined in different ways by different theoreticians. Some of the most notable definitions are as follows:\n(1) Leech [83] defines politeness as \"maintain [ing] the social equilibrium and the friendly relations which enable us to assume that our interlocutors are being cooperative in the first place\".\n(2) Another notable definition of politeness was proposed by Brown et al. [17] as \"politeness, like formal diplomatic protocol (for which it must surely be the model), presupposes that potential for aggression as it seeks to disarm it, and makes possible communication between potentially aggressive parties.\".\n(3) Lakoff [81] defines politeness as \"a means of minimizing confrontation in discourse - both the possibility of confrontation occurring at all, and the possibility that a confrontation will be perceived as threatening\".\n(4) Thomas [158] summarizes the research agendas of linguists such as those mentioned above who are concerned with the study of pragmatic politeness as \"All that is really being claimed is that people employ certain strategies (including the 50+ strategies described by Leech, Brown and Levinson, and others) for reasons of expediency experience has taught us that particular strategies are likely to succeed in given circumstances, so we use them\".\n(5) Watts [170] holds that politeness should be defined through a discursive approach. He believes that such struggle defines \"the ways in which (im)polite behaviour is evaluated and commented on by lay members and not with ways in which social scientists lift the term (im)politeness out of the realm of everyday discourse and evaluate it to the status of a theoretical concept in what is frequently called Politeness Theory\".\n(6) Yule [177] in his study asserts that individuals can be polite through \"being tactful, modest and nice to other people\".", "subsections": [{"title": "2.1 Approaches to Politeness", "content": "Several linguistic studies describe different approaches to politeness. Starting from the classic view of politeness that is based on traditional pragmatic theories, most notably Conversational Implicature [51] and Speech Act Theory [143] to post-modern view, politeness has been conceptualized as maxim-based, face-based, discursive, relational and frame-based approaches."}]}, {"title": "2.2 Politeness Variations in Linguistic Studies", "content": "Politeness analysis is a complex phenomenon because the perception of (im)politeness varies from one individual to another, and there are multiple gradations of more- or less- (im)polite behavior [50]. Thus, politeness needs to be examined in a social context. Several factors influence the use of politeness in a particular situation. In this section, we will discuss such factors emphasizing the role of gender, age, and culture in politeness usage in interaction.\nPoliteness and Gender. There has been a good amount of research on language and gender traits that attempt to identify and explain the differences in speech styles of males and females. One of the most significant distinctions has been discovered in linguistic politeness. Many studies in socio-linguistics have observed the variations in the use of politeness strategies between males and females and concluded that linguistic politeness is influenced by gender [17, 79, 100, 105]. According to these studies, women are more likely to use politeness strategies and compliments than men do while communicating. The work of Lakoff [79] is a groundbreaking study in addressing the problem of gender-related differences in politeness. The author claimed that women sound much more polite than men as they tend to use tag-questions more often than men. The tag-questions do not force belief or agreement on the addressee, and hence their use by women while interacting makes them sound more polite. Moreover, the author claimed that female speech includes many super-polite forms like \u201cwould you mind...\u201d, \u201cwould it be comfortable...", "could you tell what trouble you're facing?\u201d, \u201cwill you clean the window?": "Holmes [58] agreed that, in general, females use more tags than males, as claimed by Lakoff [79]. Besides, the author also identified that females tend to consider question-tags to indicate politeness. Males, on the other other hand, use them to express uncertainty. Holmes [57] stated that compliments are considered to be positive politeness strategies as they aim to strengthen the solidarity between the interlocutors. The notable gender difference in politeness is shown in how women and men utilize compliments. According to this study, women tend to give and receive more compliments than men. Wardhaugh [168] argued that females employ polite phrases like \"please\u201d, \u201cif you don't mind", "thank you\u201d, \u201cplease": "I'm sorry", "please": "ppears early, while indirect requests and politeness devices are used with increasing age. Moreover, the works by Maratsos [99] and Shatz and Gelman [147] showed that children are sensitive to their listeners as they use polite forms according to their needs and age.\nPoliteness and Culture. Politeness is a crucial aspect of communication, especially in cross-cultural contexts where miscommunications or misunderstandings may adversely affect the relationship between the interlocutors. The maxim-based approach to politeness introduced by Leech [85] accommodates a broader range of cultural variations. This seminal work is likely to be the most appropriate for East-West comparisons. Lakoff [80] argued that politeness tends to avoid conflicts, and there are three rules for avoiding conflicts: camaraderie, deference, and distance. The authors mentioned that different cultures have different dominant rules; for example, Australian culture often emphasizes camaraderie, Japanese culture emphasizes deference, and British culture emphasizes distance. There are also linguistic differences in how politeness is expressed and perceived across cultures [59, 65]. For instance, there are significant differences in how politeness is conveyed and evaluated by the Chinese and Americans; what might be considered polite by the Chinese may sound utterly rude to a typical American. To illustrate, a cordial offer in Mandarin, \"Come and eat with us, or I will get mad at you!", "Hi!": "r \"Hello!", "What are you doing here?": "r \"Have you eaten?", "Let": "go for a cup of tea.' The former is likely to be polite to all the people. The latter is likely to be polite for most people (friends, family, or long-standing colleagues). However, for the people who are new or senior in a position, let's say, one's employer, the statement is not polite. A direct statement like the latter one may threaten the hearer's face in restricting their freedom of action and thus may be perceived as impolite by them. Hence, the politeness understanding and computational approaches to politeness are contingent on what information or context is known."}, {"title": "2.3 Relationship with Etiquette, Formality, Emotion and Offensiveness", "content": "Politeness is related to other forms of social language and behavior, such as etiquette, formality, and emotion. The terms \"etiquette\" and \"politeness\" are likely to conjure up images of formal curtsies and the proper dining fork to use. Although both the terms are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between the two. Etiquette is the protocol via which we communicate politeness. It uses verbal, physical, gestural, and even more primitive forms of communication. For instance, people can show respect by posture, quiet speech, or by using titles and honorifics. Similar to politeness, there are differences in the use of etiquette codes across cultures [103]. Politeness and etiquette are very much at the forefront of managing social interactions and thus play a crucial role in training and predicting social interaction behaviors and perceptions across cultures.\nFormality is another important dimension of stylistic variation in language [10, 61]. Stylistic distinctions can frequently have a greater influence on how a listener interprets a statement than the literal meaning does [60], and the ability to recognize and respond to differences in formality is a necessary part of complete language understanding. Heylighen and Dewaele [55] argued that formality emerges out of a communicative objective - to maximize the amount of information being conveyed to the listener while at the same time maintaining (or at least appearing to maintain) Grice's communicative maxims of Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner as much as possible [51]. Fischer [44] discussed the use of \"respect vocabulary\" and \"formal etiquette\" as the display of politeness marking a formal situation. Formality is closely linked with various stylistic dimensions, including politeness [15, 64], suggesting a positive correlation between them.\nAnother aspect of pragmatics that has gained importance in recent politeness studies is the emotional aspects [82, 136]. Brown et al. [17] mentioned displaying emotion or lack of control of emotions as positive politeness strategies or potentially face-threatening acts. The authors further referred to the 'communication of affect' (display rules and emotional stance) as the display of affect, which is socially constructed, with cultural and situational expectations about what and how feelings should be displayed. They mentioned that communication of appropriate levels of affect is primarily concerned with linguistic politeness. Culpeper et al. [31], in his description of requests, pointed out the significance of affect and familiarity as components of B&L's distance (D) variable. Kienpointner [70] argued that the variables, power (P) and distance (D), proposed by B&L, also contain the elements of emotions. Culpeper [29] asserted that \"displaying emotions such as contempt or anger has nothing in itself to do with impoliteness. However, somebody displaying great contempt for and anger at someone and doing so publicly may be judged (..) to have acted in an inappropriately and unfairly hurtful way (..), causing an emotional reaction such as embarrassment or anger.\u201d Numerous linguistic studies indicate that emotions are essential in appraisals and relational work. Therefore, investigating the relationship between emotions and politeness can benefit linguistic politeness research.\nPoliteness is often discussed in connotation with another linguistic aspect, offensiveness. Politeness and offensiveness are essential aspects of linguistic communication that influence interpersonal relationships and social dynamics. Politeness encompasses various linguistic strategies employed to convey respect, courtesy, and consideration for others, facilitating a positive and harmonious atmosphere. Offensiveness, on the other hand, pertains to the use of language that is disrespectful, rude, or hurtful to others. The notion of offensiveness lies at the core of impoliteness [29], and it can take various forms from general and often harmless profanity to derogatory and abusive language intended to cause harm and emotional distress, such as cyberbullying and hate speech [169]. Bousfield [13] and Culpeper [29] delved into the concept of impoliteness, equating the intent to offend with posing a threat or causing damage to one's face. Culpeper [29, 30], and Haugh [54] proposed a theoretical framework to explain impoliteness, considering it as an attitudinal stance of the speaker. Offense, on the other hand, can be perceived as emotional reactions experienced by recipients or the cause of such reactions. It's important to note that acting impolitely doesn't always equate to offending, as the perception of offense varies among interlocutors. For example, interrupting a teammate during a presentation with disruptive comments may be seen as impolite, but using derogatory language to insult their intelligence is considered offensive. Offensiveness, therefore, can be viewed as an extreme form of impoliteness involving a direct attack on someone's dignity or identity.\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that instances of impoliteness/offensiveness are closely linked to the concept of politeness [28]. The degree of impoliteness or offensiveness often varies depending on the expected level of politeness in a given situation. For example, asking the Vice Chancellor of a university to be quiet might be more offensive than making the same request to a young daughter. Vogel [163] mentioned that behaviors of politeness and impoliteness can modulate offensiveness. They exist on a continuum of communication behaviors and can coexist within the same interaction. A message may have a polite tone but still convey an offensive message or criticism. Conversely, impolite language may not necessarily intend to be offensive; it could stem from a lack of awareness of social norms or an expression of frustration rather than an intentional attempt to harm. The relationship between politeness and offensiveness is multifaceted, influenced by context, intent, and individual perception [28]; what one person deems polite, another may consider impolite or offensive, highlighting the subjective nature of these concepts.\nThese characteristics of politeness pave the way for a few works in computational politeness research, which we will discuss in forthcoming sections."}, {"title": "3 PROBLEM DEFINITION", "content": "The advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques profoundly impact the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Semantic Parsing, to name a few. These techniques have also demonstrated remarkable success in contextual language under- standing and generation, enabling breakthroughs in computational discourse pragmatics. Politeness is one of the widely studied topics in discourse pragmatics. Computational models and simulations of politeness-oriented interactions hold significant utility across various applications. These include modeling customer behavior, generating responses for conversational agents and similar intelligent systems like robots, comprehending the dynamics of online communi- ties, and facilitating language learning, among others. In computational politeness, research predominantly falls into two overarching categories: identification and generation, which we will discuss in subsequent sub-sections. Table 2 and Table 3 provide a summary of past works in computational politeness identification and politeness generation, respectively. While several interesting conclusions may be drawn from both the tables, the three notable ones are: (i). requests are the pre-dominant text form for computational politeness analysis; (ii). politeness is imperative in both conversational (open-domain and task-oriented) and non-conversational settings for promoting user experience, and (iii). incorporation of contextual information in the form of conversational history is a recent trend in computational politeness modeling for dialogue systems."}, {"title": "3.1 Politeness as Natural Language Understanding Task", "content": "Recently, a few research works on computational politeness have been inclined toward identifying various linguistic features of politeness and predicting whether the given text is polite or not. Thus, given a sentence, \u201cWould you please help me?", "Would you please stop?": "hould be predicted as impolite. It is important to note that though both sentences contain the phrase 'Would you please', which is generally considered a polite way to request or ask for something, both are not polite. The perception of politeness or impoliteness in these sentences depends on the context and the nature of the request. The former sentence is typically perceived as polite because it is a polite request for assistance. In this sentence, 'Would you please', signifies respect and deference towards the person from whom the help is needed. In the latter sentence, though the polite marker 'Would you please' is used, it is perceived as impolite. It is a request for someone to cease or desist from a particular action. If used with a harsh tone, it exacerbates the perception of impoliteness. Table 2 provides a brief overview of the different datasets, languages, approaches, challenges, etc., on natural language understanding of politeness.\nThe works by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [33] and Aubakirova and Bansal [4] consider two labels, viz. polite and impolite for the classifier. Lately, Mishra et al. [107] and Mishra et al. [108] consider fine-grained labels for the classifier as: polite, somewhat_polite, somewhat_impolite, and impolite to effectively model the politeness variations in goal-oriented interactions. Thus, instead of simply classifying the given text as polite or impolite, they perform the fine-grained classification as \u201cWhat is your departure city?\u201d - impolite, \u201cCan you provide your departure city?", "Please, provide your departure city?\" - somewhat_polite, \\\"For further processing, I would like to know your departure city, please, name it?\" - polite.\nChhaya et al. [24] formulate the task of politeness prediction as a regression problem and a 2-class classification problem in which the model predicts whether the text has politeness or not. Yeomans et al. [174] develop a package in R that provides functions to extract politeness markers in the English language, graphically compare these markers to covariates of interest, develop a supervised model to identify politeness in new documents and inspect high- and low-politeness documents. Aljanaideh et al. [3] model the problem of politeness detection in natural language requests as a clustering task. The authors have created a set of clusters for every word in the request. Each cluster contains contextualized representations of the word (obtained using a pre-trained BERT model) based on the context in which the word appears and the labels of items the word occurs in. The authors state that examining the context of using words helps enrich the linguistic analyses of the politeness task. For example, the hedge \"Maybe": "an be used as a part of a polite request (\"Maybe we can meet", "Maybe it would be better if we never talked directly to each other ever again": "."}, {"title": "3.2 Politeness as Natural Language Generation Task", "content": "Several computational politeness research works concentrate on the generation of polite sentences. Given the non-polite text, the objective of the politeness generation task is to generate a politeness-oriented text. For instance, \"How can we help?", "one": "Help has arrived! We are sorry to see that you are having trouble. How can we help?\". Table 3 provides a brief overiew of the different datasets, languages, approaches, challenges, etc., on computational approaches to politeness generation.\nMadaan et al. [98] focus on politeness as a style transfer task. The authors devise a tag and generate framework for transforming non-polite sentences into polite ones. Fu et al. [45] propose a computational framework for generating a paraphrased version of a given message that meets the required degree of politeness in a particular communication situation. In recent times, there has been a surge in interest in incorporating politeness besides various styles, emotions, and personalities in conversational artificial intelligent agents to make them behave human-like. The work of Walker et al. [165] represents an initial effort to infuse politeness into conversational agents that provide interesting variations of character and personality in an interactive narrative application. Gupta et al. [53] explore building more affective and socially intelligent task-oriented conversational agents by incorporating different politeness strategies in the culinary instructions. Niu and Bansal [122] attempt to induce politeness in chit-chat conversations in the absence of parallel data. Golchha et al. [49] and Firdaus et al. [40] present a method for inducing polite phrases in customer-care responses to enhance user satisfaction. Wang et al. [167] infuse the social language, viz. politeness and positivity in customer support agents' responses. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary\u2074, positivity is the quality or state of being positive. The authors argue that the users would prefer a conversational agent exhibiting more polite and positive behavior and would be more willing to engage with, respond to, and persist in the interaction when conversing with such agents. Their work is motivated by previous research works that have shown that positivity can engage employees and improve their performance in the workplace [153] and leads to likeability as it is the language that is upbeat and cheerful [32]. Rana et al. [135] use the state-of-the-art tag and generate approach to introduce politeness in normal chatbot responses and study the effects of polite triggers among different genders, age groups, and personalities using a cross-sectional analysis. Lately, Firdaus et al. [43] also attempt to show the variation in politeness according to the specified personas. Notably, they introduce an approach to generate polite and personalized dialogue responses according to the user's personal information, primarily based on the age and gender of the user, while being contextually consistent with the conversational history. Saha et al. [140] propose an ensemble framework for generating polite, detoxified, and emotionally charged counterspeech to combat the rising online hate speech. Silva et al. [148] extend the state-of-the-art generative [122] and rewriting [98] approaches to overcome the domain-shift problem and enable the transfer of politeness patterns to a new fashion domain. Sennrich et al. [144] model the politeness interpretation as a machine translation task for English \u2192 German. Feely et al. [38] use a similar formulation and controls the honorifics (politeness) in NMT from English \u2192 Japanese.\nSeveral recent studies have delved into the task of generating polite responses, taking into account a range of affective states and socio-linguistic cues [41, 42, 110-112, 130]. Firdaus et al. [41] focus on incorporating user sentiment information to produce contextually appropriate polite responses. Likewise, Firdaus et al. [42] leverage the user's affective states, encompassing emotional and sentiment information, to generate polite responses that exhibit relevant polite behaviors such as greetings, apologies, assurances, appreciations, or expressions of empathy. Mishra et al. [111] introduce a system for generating polite and empathetic responses, while their subsequent study by Mishra et al. [112] utilizes users' emotional information for the same purpose. Priya et al. [130] introduce a dialogue system capable of generating persuasive responses that adapt politeness and empathy strategies. Mishra et al. [110] incorporate factors such as gender, age, persona, and sentiment information of users to generate contextually relevant polite and interpersonal responses.\""}, {"title": "3.3 A note on languages", "content": "Politeness is an important facet of communication and is sometimes argued to be cultural-specific, yet existing computational linguistic studies of politeness are primarily dominated by the English language. A few research works in other languages, viz., Hindi [40, 75], German [144], Japanese [38] and Chinese [88] have also been reported. Similar to politeness research in the English language, there exists a dual focus on the research on politeness analysis in other languages, with some studies concentrating on politeness identification, while others center their efforts on politeness generation. The authors in [75, 88, 152] formulate the politeness analysis as an identification task. Kumar [75] and Li et al. [88] attempt to identify politeness in natural language text, focusing on Hindi and Chinese languages, respectively. Srinivasan and Choi [152] evaluate how well multilingual models can identify politeness in text. They conduct this study in nine typologically diverse languages, namely Hindi, Tamil, Korean, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Russian, Afrikaans, and Hungarian.\nSeveral studies like the works in [38, 40, 144, 162] approach politeness from the perspective of a generation task, aiming to generate or maintain politeness in response to given inputs. The authors in [38, 144, 162] devise a methodology to regulate the degree of formality or politeness in the neural machine translation (NMT) from one language to another. Sennrich et al. [144] and Feely et al. [38] perform a pilot study to control honorifics in NMT focusing on English \u2192 German and English \u2192 Japanese, respectively. Recently, Viswanathan et al. [162] develop a domain adaptation technique to bias a model to produce translations according to a desired formality or register. The authors experiment with formality levels for different language pairs: English \u2192 French, English \u2192 Spanish, and English \u2192 Czech. Firdaus et al. [40] propose methods to induce courteous behavior in generic customer-care responses in multilingual scenarios (English and Hindi).\nSome of the aforementioned studies have made significant contributions to dataset creation, while others have contributed significantly to the development of novel approaches and methodologies.

It is generally anticipated that such requests will be couched in remarkably polite language to ingratiate the requestor with the person in a position to honor the request. However, due to text length constraints set by some online platforms, this text tends to be brief and lacks the necessary verbal and behavioral signals that help to grasp and interpret a given piece of communication as polite or impolite. Despite such barriers, datasets of requests have been popular for studying politeness from a computational point of view.

Sections 3, 4, and 5 successively discuss the different problem definitions, datasets and approaches for computational politeness studies. In Section 6, we present the reported performance values. Section 7 covers the underlying trends in computational politeness followed by the issues in Section 8. Eventually, Section 9 concludes the article and makes recommendations for future research work. We have included tables and examples in this survey paper that may be used to gain a better understanding of computational politeness studies. The primary objective of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of previous work in the field of computational politeness, with insights into future research that may prove valuable to researchers interested in computational politeness and related fields."}, {"title": "2 POLITENESS STUDIES IN LINGUISTICS", "content": "Before discussing computational approaches to politeness, we outline a brief overview of linguistic studies about politeness in this section. Politeness is amongst the most crucial components of human communication, and it has the potential to determine the success or failure of any human interaction [75]. Politeness studies have taken center stage in pragmatics research during the past few decades. These studies have mainly focused on applying various communicative tactics to preserve or promote social harmony. Politeness has been defined in different ways by different theoreticians. Some of the most notable definitions are as follows:\n(1) Leech [83] defines politeness as \"maintain [ing] the social equilibrium and the friendly relations which enable us to assume that our interlocutors are being cooperative in the first place\".\n(2) Another notable definition of politeness was proposed by Brown et al. [17] as \"politeness, like formal diplomatic protocol (for which it must surely be the model), presupposes that potential for aggression as it seeks to disarm it, and makes possible communication between potentially aggressive parties.\".\n(3) Lakoff [81] defines politeness as \"a means of minimizing confrontation in discourse - both the possibility of confrontation occurring at all, and the possibility that a confrontation will be perceived as threatening\".\n(4) Thomas [158] summarizes the research agendas of linguists such as those mentioned above who are concerned with the study of pragmatic politeness as \"All that is really being claimed is that people employ certain strategies (including the 50+ strategies described by Leech, Brown and Levinson, and others) for reasons of expediency experience has taught us that particular strategies are likely to succeed in given circumstances, so we use them\".\n(5) Watts [170] holds that politeness should be defined through a discursive approach. He believes that such struggle defines \"the ways in which (im)polite behaviour is evaluated and commented on by lay members and not with ways in which social scientists lift the term (im)politeness out of the realm of everyday discourse and evaluate it to the status of a theoretical concept in what is frequently called Politeness Theory\".\n(6) Yule [177] in his study asserts that individuals can be polite through \"being tactful, modest and nice to other people\".", "subsections": [{"title": "2.1 Approaches to Politeness", "content": "Several linguistic studies describe different approaches to politeness. Starting from the classic view of politeness that is based on traditional pragmatic theories, most notably Conversational Implicature [51] and Speech Act Theory [143] to post-modern view, politeness has been conceptualized as maxim-based, face-based, discursive, relational and frame-based approaches."}]}, {"title": "2.2 Politeness Variations in Linguistic Studies", "content": "Politeness analysis is a complex phenomenon because the perception of (im)politeness varies from one individual to another, and there are multiple gradations of more- or less- (im)polite behavior [50]. Thus, politeness needs to be examined in a social context. Several factors influence the use of politeness in a particular situation. In this section, we will discuss such factors emphasizing the role of gender, age, and culture in politeness usage in interaction.\nPoliteness and Gender. There has been a good amount of research on language and gender traits that attempt to identify and explain the differences in speech styles of males and females. One of the most significant distinctions has been discovered in linguistic politeness. Many studies in socio-linguistics have observed the variations in the use of politeness strategies between males and females and concluded that linguistic politeness is influenced by gender [17, 79, 100, 105]. According to these studies, women are more likely to use politeness strategies and compliments than men do while communicating. The work of Lakoff [79] is a groundbreaking study in addressing the problem of gender-related differences in politeness. The author claimed that women sound much more polite than men as they tend to use tag-questions more often than men. The tag-questions do not force belief or agreement on the addressee, and hence their use by women while interacting makes them sound more polite. Moreover, the author claimed that female speech includes many super-polite forms like \u201cwould you mind...\u201d, \u201cwould it be comfortable...", "could you tell what trouble you're facing?\u201d, \u201cwill you clean the window?": "Holmes [58] agreed that, in general, females use more tags than males, as claimed by Lakoff [79]. Besides, the author also identified that females tend to consider question-tags to indicate politeness. Males, on the other other hand, use them to express uncertainty. Holmes [57] stated that compliments are considered to be positive politeness strategies as they aim to strengthen the solidarity between the interlocutors. The notable gender difference in politeness is shown in how women and men utilize compliments. According to this study, women tend to give and receive more compliments than men. Wardhaugh [168] argued that females employ polite phrases like \"please\u201d, \u201cif you don't mind", "thank you\u201d, \u201cplease": "I'm sorry", "please": "ppears early, while indirect requests and politeness devices are used with increasing age. Moreover, the works by Maratsos [99] and Shatz and Gelman [147] showed that children are sensitive to their listeners as they use polite forms according to their needs and age.\nPoliteness and Culture. Politeness is a crucial aspect of communication, especially in cross-cultural contexts where miscommunications or misunderstandings may adversely affect the relationship between the interlocutors. The maxim-based approach to politeness introduced by Leech [85] accommodates a broader range of cultural variations. This seminal work is likely to be the most appropriate for East-West comparisons. Lakoff [80] argued that politeness tends to avoid conflicts, and there are three rules for avoiding conflicts: camaraderie, deference, and distance. The authors mentioned that different cultures have different dominant rules; for example, Australian culture often emphasizes camaraderie, Japanese culture emphasizes deference, and British culture emphasizes distance. There are also linguistic differences in how politeness is expressed and perceived across cultures [59, 65]. For instance, there are significant differences in how politeness is conveyed and evaluated by the Chinese and Americans; what might be considered polite by the Chinese may sound utterly rude to a typical American. To illustrate, a cordial offer in Mandarin, \"Come and eat with us, or I will get mad at you!", "Hi!": "r \"Hello!", "What are you doing here?": "r \"Have you eaten?", "Let": "go for a cup of tea.' The former is likely to be polite to all the people. The latter is likely to be polite for most people (friends, family, or long-standing colleagues). However, for the people who are new or senior in a position, let's say, one's employer, the statement is not polite. A direct statement like the latter one may threaten the hearer's face in restricting their freedom of action and thus may be perceived as impolite by them. Hence, the politeness understanding and computational approaches to politeness are contingent on what information or context is known."}, {"title": "2.3 Relationship with Etiquette, Formality, Emotion and Offensiveness", "content": "Politeness is related to other forms of social language and behavior, such as etiquette, formality, and emotion. The terms \"etiquette\" and \"politeness\" are likely to conjure up images of formal curtsies and the proper dining fork to use. Although both the terms are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between the two. Etiquette is the protocol via which we communicate politeness. It uses verbal, physical, gestural, and even more primitive forms of communication. For instance, people can show respect by posture, quiet speech, or by using titles and honorifics. Similar to politeness, there are differences in the use of etiquette codes across cultures [103]. Politeness and etiquette are very much at the forefront of managing social interactions and thus play a crucial role in training and predicting social interaction behaviors and perceptions across cultures.\nFormality is another important dimension of stylistic variation in language [10, 61]. Stylistic distinctions can frequently have a greater influence on how a listener interprets a statement than the literal meaning does [60], and the ability to recognize and respond to differences in formality is a necessary part of complete language understanding. Heylighen and Dewaele [55] argued that formality emerges out of a communicative objective - to maximize the amount of information being conveyed to the listener while at the same time maintaining (or at least appearing to maintain) Grice's communicative maxims of Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner as much as possible [51]. Fischer [44] discussed the use of \"respect vocabulary\" and \"formal etiquette\" as the display of politeness marking a formal situation. Formality is closely linked with various stylistic dimensions, including politeness [15, 64], suggesting a positive correlation between them.\nAnother aspect of pragmatics that has gained importance in recent politeness studies is the emotional aspects [82, 136]. Brown et al. [17] mentioned displaying emotion or lack of control of emotions as positive politeness strategies or potentially face-threatening acts. The authors further referred to the 'communication of affect' (display rules and emotional stance) as the display of affect, which is socially constructed, with cultural and situational expectations about what and how feelings should be displayed. They mentioned that communication of appropriate levels of affect is primarily concerned with linguistic politeness. Culpeper et al. [31], in his description of requests, pointed out the significance of affect and familiarity as components of B&L's distance (D) variable. Kienpointner [70] argued that the variables, power (P) and distance (D), proposed by B&L, also contain the elements of emotions. Culpeper [29] asserted that \"displaying emotions such as contempt or anger has nothing in itself to do with impoliteness. However, somebody displaying great contempt for and anger at someone and doing so publicly may be judged (..) to have acted in an inappropriately and unfairly hurtful way (..), causing an emotional reaction such as embarrassment or anger.\u201d Numerous linguistic studies indicate that emotions are essential in appraisals and relational work. Therefore, investigating the relationship between emotions and politeness can benefit linguistic politeness research.\nPoliteness is often discussed in connotation with another linguistic aspect, offensiveness. Politeness and offensiveness are essential aspects of linguistic communication that influence interpersonal relationships and social dynamics. Politeness encompasses various linguistic strategies employed to convey respect, courtesy, and consideration for others, facilitating a positive and harmonious atmosphere. Offensiveness, on the other hand, pertains to the use of language that is disrespectful, rude, or hurtful to others. The notion of offensiveness lies at the core of impoliteness [29], and it can take various forms from general and often harmless profanity to derogatory and abusive language intended to cause harm and emotional distress, such as cyberbullying and hate speech [169]. Bousfield [13] and Culpeper [29] delved into the concept of impoliteness, equating the intent to offend with posing a threat or causing damage to one's face. Culpeper [29, 30], and Haugh [54] proposed a theoretical framework to explain impoliteness, considering it as an attitudinal stance of the speaker. Offense, on the other hand, can be perceived as emotional reactions experienced by recipients or the cause of such reactions. It's important to note that acting impolitely doesn't always equate to offending, as the perception of offense varies among interlocutors. For example, interrupting a teammate during a presentation with disruptive comments may be seen as impolite, but using derogatory language to insult their intelligence is considered offensive. Offensiveness, therefore, can be viewed as an extreme form of impoliteness involving a direct attack on someone's dignity or identity.\nNevertheless, it cannot be denied that instances of impoliteness/offensiveness are closely linked to the concept of politeness [28]. The degree of impoliteness or offensiveness often varies depending on the expected level of politeness in a given situation. For example, asking the Vice Chancellor of a university to be quiet might be more offensive than making the same request to a young daughter. Vogel [163] mentioned that behaviors of politeness and impoliteness can modulate offensiveness. They exist on a continuum of communication behaviors and can coexist within the same interaction. A message may have a polite tone but still convey an offensive message or criticism. Conversely, impolite language may not necessarily intend to be offensive; it could stem from a lack of awareness of social norms or an expression of frustration rather than an intentional attempt to harm. The relationship between politeness and offensiveness is multifaceted, influenced by context, intent, and individual perception [28]; what one person deems polite, another may consider impolite or offensive, highlighting the subjective nature of these concepts.\nThese characteristics of politeness pave the way for a few works in computational politeness research, which we will discuss in forthcoming sections."}, {"title": "3 PROBLEM DEFINITION", "content": "The advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques profoundly impact the performance of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as Part-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Semantic Parsing, to name a few. These techniques have also demonstrated remarkable success in contextual language under- standing and generation, enabling breakthroughs in computational discourse pragmatics. Politeness is one of the widely studied topics in discourse pragmatics. Computational models and simulations of politeness-oriented interactions hold significant utility across various applications. These include modeling customer behavior, generating responses for conversational agents and similar intelligent systems like robots, comprehending the dynamics of online communi- ties, and facilitating language learning, among others. In computational politeness, research predominantly falls into two overarching categories: identification and generation, which we will discuss in subsequent sub-sections. Table 2 and Table 3 provide a summary of past works in computational politeness identification and politeness generation, respectively. While several interesting conclusions may be drawn from both the tables, the three notable ones are: (i). requests are the pre-dominant text form for computational politeness analysis; (ii). politeness is imperative in both conversational (open-domain and task-oriented) and non-conversational settings for promoting user experience, and (iii). incorporation of contextual information in the form of conversational history is a recent trend in computational politeness modeling for dialogue systems."}, {"title": "3.1 Politeness as Natural Language Understanding Task", "content": "Recently, a few research works on computational politeness have been inclined toward identifying various linguistic features of politeness and predicting whether the given text is polite or not. Thus, given a sentence, \u201cWould you please help me?", "Would you please stop?": "hould be predicted as impolite. It is important to note that though both sentences contain the phrase 'Would you please', which is generally considered a polite way to request or ask for something, both are not polite. The perception of politeness or impoliteness in these sentences depends on the context and the nature of the request. The former sentence is typically perceived as polite because it is a polite request for assistance. In this sentence, 'Would you please', signifies respect and deference towards the person from whom the help is needed. In the latter sentence, though the polite marker 'Would you please' is used, it is perceived as impolite. It is a request for someone to cease or desist from a particular action. If used with a harsh tone, it exacerbates the perception of impoliteness. Table 2 provides a brief overview of the different datasets, languages, approaches, challenges, etc., on natural language understanding of politeness.\nThe works by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. [33] and Aubakirova and Bansal [4] consider two labels, viz. polite and impolite for the classifier. Lately, Mishra et al. [107] and Mishra et al. [108] consider fine-grained labels for the classifier as: polite, somewhat_polite, somewhat_impolite, and impolite to effectively model the politeness variations in goal-oriented interactions. Thus, instead of simply classifying the given text as polite or impolite, they perform the fine-grained classification as \u201cWhat is your departure city?\u201d - impolite, \u201cCan you provide your departure city?", "Please, provide your departure city?\" - somewhat_polite, \\\"For further processing, I would like to know your departure city, please, name it?\" - polite.\nChhaya et al. [24] formulate the task of politeness prediction as a regression problem and a 2-class classification problem in which the model predicts whether the text has politeness or not. Yeomans et al. [174] develop a package in R that provides functions to extract politeness markers in the English language, graphically compare these markers to covariates of interest, develop a supervised model to identify politeness in new documents and inspect high- and low-politeness documents. Aljanaideh et al. [3] model the problem of politeness detection in natural language requests as a clustering task. The authors have created a set of clusters for every word in the request. Each cluster contains contextualized representations of the word (obtained using a pre-trained BERT model) based on the context in which the word appears and the labels of items the word occurs in. The authors state that examining the context of using words helps enrich the linguistic analyses of the politeness task. For example, the hedge \"Maybe": "an be used as a part of a polite request (\"Maybe we can meet", "Maybe it would be better if we never talked directly to each other ever again": "."}, {"title": "3.2 Politeness as Natural Language Generation Task", "content": "Several computational politeness research works concentrate on the generation of polite sentences. Given the non-polite text, the objective of the politeness generation task is to generate a politeness-oriented text. For instance, \"How can we help?", "one": "Help has arrived! We are sorry to see that you are having trouble. How can we help?\". Table 3 provides a brief overiew of the different datasets, languages, approaches, challenges, etc., on computational approaches to politeness generation.\nMadaan et al. [98] focus on politeness as a style transfer task. The authors devise a tag and generate framework for transforming non-polite sentences into polite ones. Fu et al. [45] propose a computational framework for generating a paraphrased version of a given message that meets the required degree of politeness in a particular communication situation. In recent times, there has been a surge in interest in incorporating politeness besides various styles, emotions, and personalities in conversational artificial intelligent agents to make them behave human-like. The work of Walker et al. [165] represents an initial effort to infuse politeness into conversational agents that provide interesting variations of character and personality in an interactive narrative application. Gupta et al. [53] explore building more affective and socially intelligent task-oriented conversational agents by incorporating different politeness strategies in the culinary instructions. Niu and Bansal [122] attempt to induce politeness in chit-chat conversations in the absence of parallel data. Golchha et al. [49] and Firdaus et al. [40] present a method for inducing polite phrases in customer-care responses to enhance user satisfaction. Wang et al. [167] infuse the social language, viz. politeness and positivity in customer support agents' responses. According to Merriam-Webster dictionary\u2074, positivity is the quality or state of being positive. The authors argue that the users would prefer a conversational agent exhibiting more polite and positive behavior and would be more willing to engage with, respond to, and persist in the interaction when conversing with such agents. Their work is motivated by previous research works that have shown that positivity can engage employees and improve their performance in the workplace [153] and leads to likeability as it is the language that is upbeat and cheerful [32]. Rana et al. [135] use the state-of-the-art tag and generate approach to introduce politeness in normal chatbot responses and study the effects of polite triggers among different genders, age groups, and personalities using a cross-sectional analysis. Lately, Firdaus et al. [43] also attempt to show the variation in politeness according to the specified personas. Notably, they introduce an approach to generate polite and personalized dialogue responses according to the user's personal information, primarily based on the age and gender of the user, while being contextually consistent with the conversational history. Saha et al. [140] propose an ensemble framework for generating polite, detoxified, and emotionally charged counterspeech to combat the rising online hate speech. Silva et al. [148] extend the state-of-the-art generative [122] and rewriting [98] approaches to overcome the domain-shift problem and enable the transfer of politeness patterns to a new fashion domain. Sennrich et al. [144] model the politeness interpretation as a machine translation task for English \u2192 German. Feely et al. [38] use a similar formulation and controls the honorifics (politeness) in NMT from English \u2192 Japanese.\nSeveral recent studies have delved into the task of generating polite responses, taking into account a range of affective states and socio-linguistic cues [41, 42, 110-112, 130]. Firdaus et al. [41] focus on incorporating user sentiment information to produce contextually appropriate polite responses. Likewise, Firdaus et al. [42] leverage the user's affective states, encompassing emotional and sentiment information, to generate polite responses that exhibit relevant polite behaviors such as greetings, apologies, assurances, appreciations, or expressions of empathy. Mishra et al. [111] introduce a system for generating polite and empathetic responses, while their subsequent study by Mishra et al. [112] utilizes users' emotional information for the same purpose. Priya et al. [130] introduce a dialogue system capable of generating persuasive responses that adapt politeness and empathy strategies. Mishra et al. [110] incorporate factors such as gender, age, persona, and sentiment information of users to generate contextually relevant polite and interpersonal responses.\""}, {"title": "3.3 A note on languages", "content": "Politeness is an important facet of communication and is sometimes argued to be cultural-specific, yet existing computational linguistic studies of politeness are primarily dominated by the English language. A few research works in other languages, viz., Hindi [40, 75], German [144], Japanese [38] and Chinese [88] have also been reported. Similar to politeness research in the English language, there exists a dual focus on the research on politeness analysis in other languages, with some studies concentrating on politeness identification, while others center their efforts on politeness generation. The authors in [75, 88, 152] formulate the politeness analysis as an identification task. Kumar [75] and Li et al. [88] attempt to identify politeness in natural language text, focusing on Hindi and Chinese languages, respectively. Srinivasan and Choi [152] evaluate how well multilingual models can identify politeness in text. They conduct this study in nine typologically diverse languages, namely Hindi, Tamil, Korean, Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Russian, Afrikaans, and Hungarian.\nSeveral studies like the works in [38, 40, 144, 162] approach politeness from the perspective of a generation task, aiming to generate or maintain politeness in response to given inputs. The authors in [38, 144, 162] devise a methodology to regulate the degree of formality or politeness in the neural machine translation (NMT) from one language to another. Sennrich et al. [144] and Feely et al. [38] perform a pilot study to control honorifics in NMT focusing on English \u2192 German and English \u2192 Japanese, respectively. Recently, Viswanathan et al. [162] develop a domain adaptation technique to bias a model to produce translations according to a desired formality or register. The authors experiment with formality levels for different language pairs: English \u2192 French, English \u2192 Spanish, and English \u2192 Czech. Firdaus et al. [40] propose methods to induce courteous behavior in generic customer-care responses in multilingual scenarios (English and Hindi).\nSome of the aforementioned studies have made significant contributions to dataset creation, while others have contributed significantly to the development of novel approaches and methodologies. The specifics of the datasets and methodologies introduced in these works are elaborated upon in the Dataset and Approaches sections of this manuscript."}, {"title": "4 DATASETS", "content": "In this section, we outline the datasets utilized for computational politeness research. We categorize these datasets into non-conversational data (such as request posts on online forums) and conversational data (such as user-agent interaction)."}, {"title": "4.1 Non-conversational Dataset", "content": "Social media, websites, blogs, and emails facilitate access to a vast amount of user-generated content in the form of text. These textual data may be of various types like user queries, complaints, etc. All these texts involve making requests in one or another form; requests for seeking information, requests for help, or requests for specific action. It is generally anticipated that such requests will be couched in remarkably polite language to ingratiate the requestor with the person in a position to honor the request. However, due to text length constraints set by some online platforms, this text tends to be brief and lacks the necessary verbal and behavioral signals that help to grasp and interpret a given piece of communication as polite or impolite. Despite such barriers, datasets of requests have been popular for studying politeness from a computational point of view. The reason is that the requests involve the use of B&L's negative politeness strategy: minimizing the imposition on the addressee, for example, by apologizing for the imposition \u201cI'm really sorry but...", "Would you mind if...": "nThe pioneering research by Danes"}]}]}

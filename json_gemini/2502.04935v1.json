Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting is crucial for effective market participation, where price dynamics can be significantly more challenging to predict. Probabilistic forecasting, through prediction intervals, efficiently quantifies the inherent uncertainties in electricity prices, supporting better decision-making for market participants. This study explores the enhancement of probabilistic price prediction using Conformal Prediction (CP) techniques, specifically Ensemble Batch Prediction Intervals and Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference. These methods provide precise and reliable prediction intervals, out-performing traditional models in validity metrics.

Introduction", "content": "Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) is particularly challenging due to market volatility, sudden price fluctuations, and seasonal demand shifts. Accurate EPF is essential for all market participants in deregulated markets, providing a foundation for informed decision-making and financial planning. Power generation companies rely on forecasts to hedge against risks from deviations between day-ahead and real-time markets, thereby stabilising revenue streams and operational planning. Load-serving utilities use forecasts to secure energy at lower prices, optimising procurement strategies and ensuring cost-effective supply for consumers. Virtual traders, lacking actual generation power or load requirements, depend on EPF to estimate price spreads between spot and forward markets, exploiting arbitrage opportunities to generate profits. The increasing integration of renewable energy sources and the advent of smart grids further complicate EPF, exacerbating market volatility.\nSpot markets such as the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), Intra-Day Market (IDM), and Balancing Market (BM) are crucial for maintaining grid stability. Yet, increasing market price volatility, driven by forecast errors in renewable electricity generation, presents significant challenges Ortner & Totschnig (2019). This underscores the critical importance of accurate forecasting in stabilising energy production planning, optimising trading strategies, and implementing"}, {"title": "1.1.

While the DAM enhances cross-border electricity trading and grid stability, it faces challenges from forecast uncertainties driven by the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar Miraki et al.

These challenges necessitate advanced forecasting models capable of managing the variability introduced by weather-dependent renewables, such as privacy-preserving frameworks that enhance accuracy by integrating diverse data sources Liu & Zhang (2025).

Given a dataset $Z = \\{(x_t, y_t)\\}_{t=1}^N$, where $x_t$ represents the covariates and $y_t$ the response variable, our objective at each time step $t$ is to predict the next price $y_t$ based on previous prices and covariates $x_t$. The prediction is made using a model $f$, such that:\n$\\hat{y}_t = f(x_t)$ (1)\nwhere $\\hat{y}_t$ is the model's prediction. The models are trained on the historical dataset Z, which consists of N input-output pairs. The conditional quantile function $Q_{y_t}(\\alpha | x_t)$ estimates the value below which a certain percentage $\\alpha$ of the future price $y_t$ is expected to fall, given the covariates $x_t$.

The data is split into two subsets: a training set $Z_{train}$ and a calibration set $Z_{cal}$.

We found that QR and QRA approaches performed well in efficiency metrics but fell short in coverage, where CP methods like SCP, EnbPI, and SPCI excelled. The ensemble approach (Q-Ens) demonstrated strong results in both efficiency and validity, and it delivered superior financial outcomes in a single trade and high-frequency trading strategy, confirming its practical value for market participants. The integration of CP techniques into EPF offers a promising way to improve forecast reliability and financial outcomes, especially as the energy market evolves and renewable energy integration increases. However, the financial evaluation, based on simulated trading, may not fully capture the complexities of real-world market conditions, including transaction costs, market liquidity, and sudden structural shifts. Therefore, further research should focus on testing these methods in diverse markets, including IDM, and exploring the practical limitations of CP models, particularly in environments with extreme price events or limited historical data. Future studies could also delve deeper into more granular 5-minute BM datasets and incorporate probabilistic forecasting frameworks that address transaction costs and market conditions. Additionally, improving the robustness of CP methods, particularly with respect to outliers and non-exchangeable time series, will be fundamental. Exploring the application of CP models in renewable energy forecasting, smart grid management, and real-time data streams presents a rich avenue for future development, which will help to create more adaptable and reliable forecasting systems in increasingly complex energy markets."}]}

FCA has applications across various fields, including information retrieval, association rule mining, data analysis, and ontology engineering. Lattice-based propositional logic, along with its polarity-based semantics, has been developed as a logic for reasoning about formal contexts and the concepts they define [3,4]. This logic establishes a monotone consequence relation, denoted by \\vdash, between concepts. Specifically, C1 \\vdash C2 is interpreted as 'all the objects in C1 are in C2', or equivalently, 'all the features in the description of C2 are in the description of C1', which means that 'C1 is a subconcept of C2'.\nHowever, in many real-life applications, it is crucial to define a defeasible consequence relation, denoted by ~A (or ~x), which formalizes the notion that 'all the objects in C1 are in C2, with some exceptions' (or 'all the features in the description of C2 are in the description of C1, with some exceptions'). In other words, this relation captures the idea that all the 'typical' or 'normal' objects (resp. features) in C1 (resp. C2) are in C2 (resp. C1). It is important to note that such a relation, ~A (or\u251c~x), is usually non-monotonic. For example, let C1 and C2 represent the concepts of 'mammals' and 'viviparous animals',"}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "In this section, we gather some useful preliminaries about the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning developed in [8], and lattice-based propositional logic and its polarity-based semantics based on [5] and [4].

We also generalize the cumulative models, cumulative ordered models and preferential models to conceptual settings and show the soundness and completeness for them.\nTo generalize the cumulative reasoning to conceptual setting, we have to make the following modifications to the logic and models described in [8]: (1) In [8], the language of underlying logic is assumed to be closed under all the classical connectives including negation and implication. However, lattice-based propositional logic does not have negation and implication in its language. Thus, we replace the formula \u2192 in the rules and axioms of C with the sequent \u03c6 \\vdash \u03c8. We choose \\vdash as the replacement because it has similar interpretation to \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 in the sense that, for any polarity-based model M = (P, V) with P = (A, X, I), M |= \u03c6 \\vdash \u03c8 iff for any a \u2208 A, M,\u0430 |= \u03c6 implies M, a |= \u03c8.\n(2) As the underlying logic in [8] is assumed to have implication and deduction theorem, the compactness of this logic is enough to prove [8, Lemma 8] which is central in completeness proof. In our setting, as we do not have implication in the language, we need the modified version of compactness (cf. Proposition 1) to obtain the counterpart of that (cf. Lemma 2). (3) In polarity-based models, satisfaction and co-satisfaction relations are defined locally at each object or feature. Thus, possible worlds in our setting are pointed polarity-based models (cf. Definition 1). This is similar to approach used in [2] to define KLM-style modal logics.\nGiven any \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 L, \u03c6 \\sim \u03c8 is a cumulative L-sequent. Similar to the propositional setting, we interpret C1 \\sim C2 as 'typically or commonly, objects in C1 are"}, {"title": "Conceptual Cumulative Models", "content": "Now, we introduce conceptual cumulative models to capture cumulative reasoning about concepts from a semantic perspective. Informally, our models consist of states which are sets of pointed polarity-based models (cf. Definition 1), with a binary relation between those states. This relation represents the preferences that the reasoner may have between different states. The reasoner, described by a conceptual cumulative model, accepts a conditional assertion \u03c6 \\sim \u03c8 if and only if all the pointed polarity-based models in any most preferred states for \u03c6, are also pointed polarity-based models for \u03c8.\nDefinition 1. A pointed polarity-based model is a tuple Ma = (P, V, a), where P = (A, X, I) is a polarity, V : Prop \u2192 P+ is a valuation on P, and a \u2208 A. We call a the pointed object of Ma.\nDefinition 2. LetU be a set of pointed polarity-based models, and M = (S,1, <) be a tuple, where S is a non-empty set of states, I : S \u2192 P(U) is a map which assigns each state to a set of pointed polarity-based models, and < is a binary relation on S. For any \u03c6 \u2208 L, and s \u2208 S, s |= \u03c6 iff for all Ma \u2208 l(s), Ma |= \u03c6.\nM is said to be a conceptual cumulative model if the set \u03c6 = {s | s \u2208 S, s |= \u03c6} is smooth for any \u03c6 \u2208 L. A conceptual cumulative model M = (S,l, <) is called a strong conceptual cumulative model if the relation < is asymmetric and the set \u03c6 has a minimum for every \u03c6 \u2208 L.\nThe relation < represents the reasoner's preference among states. Given two states s and t, s < t means that, in the reasoner's mind, s is preferred to or more natural than t. For example, when considering the category of birds, one may prefer a state consisting of pointed models with a pigeon as the pointed object over a state consisting of pointed models with a penguin as the pointed object.\nWe now define the consequence relation on the conceptual cumulative models.\nDefinition 3. Given a conceptual cumulative model M = (S,l, <), the consequence relation defined by M, denoted as \\sim_M, is defined by: \u03c61 \\sim_M \u03c62 iff for any s minimal in \u03c61, we have s \u2208 \u03c62."}, {"title": "Characterization of Conceptual Cumulative Consequence Relations", "content": "In this section, we shall characterize the relationship between conceptual cumulative models and conceptual cumulative consequence relations.

A conceptual cumulative model M = (S,1,\u4eba) is said to be a conceptual cumulative ordered model if < is a strict partial order.\nThus, a conceptual cumulative ordered model is a conceptual cumulative model in which the preference relation is asymmetric and transitive. As the rule (Loop) in propositional setting contains no connectives, it can also be seen as a rule for conceptual reasoning.\n\\frac{\\phi_0 \\sim \\phi_1 \\ \\phi_1 \\sim \\phi_2 \\ ... \\ \\phi_{n-1} \\sim \\phi_n \\ \\phi_n \\sim \\phi_0}{\\phi_0 \\sim \\phi_n} (Loop)\nWe call the extension of CC with the above rule (Loop) CCL (conceptual cumulative reasoning with loop). A consequence relation that satisfies all the rules and axioms of CCL is said to be loop-cumulative.

We can show that <+ is irreflexive and, hence it turns out to be a strict partial order analogous to [8, Lemma 16].

Hence, unlike classical preferential models, \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 = \u03c6 \u222a \u03c8 is not valid in conceptual preferential models. Thus, the rule (Or) is not valid on conceptual preferential models. In fact, we will show that system CC is complete w.r.t. the class of conceptual preferential models.\nDefinition 8.

For any \u03c6 \u2208 L, there exists a pointed polarity-based model Ma which is supernormal for \u03c6.\nProof. Let \u0393 = {\u03c8 \u2208 L | \u03c6 \u00a5\\sim \u03c8}, and \u2206 = {\u03c8 \u2208 L | \u03c6 \u00a5 \u03c8}. By Lemma 2, for any x \u2208 A, there exists a pointed polarity-based model No, such that No |= \u03c6 for all \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393, and No |= x. Thus, by Proposition 2, there exists a pointed polarity-based model Ma such that Ma |= \u03c6 for all \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393, and Ma |= x for all x \u2208 \u0394. That is, Ma is supernormal for \u03c6.\nNote that this lemma does not hold in the setting of [8] as Proposition 2 does not hold in propositional setting.\nFor a given defeasible consequence relation satisfying all the rules and axioms of CC, we define a conceptual preferential model similar to the conceptual cumulative model defined in Section 3.2 with only the following difference: For any state \u03c6/, l(\u03c6/~) = Ma, where Ma is supernormal for \u03c6.

The bill addresses growing public\nconcerns about the widespread use of automated decision systems (ADS). It proposes that\norganisations deploying such systems must take several concrete steps to identify and mitigate the\nsocial, ethical, and legal risks. As a legislative effort to regulate ADS across industries, the US AAA is\nthe latest milestone in a worldwide trend to complement or replace self-regulation in this domain\nwith legislation (Floridi, 2021). The most influential example of that trend is the Artificial Intelligence\nAct (EU AIA), proposed by the European Commission (2021).\nHowever, the similarities between the US AAA and the EU AIA are only apparent. Consider\npolitics first. The EU AIA was proposed by the EU's executive branch, highlighting strong institutional\nbacking for the act (even if it will probably evolve before passing into legislation). In contrast, the US\nAAA has yet to win support in the Senate or the House. While the bill is a revised (and improved)\nversion of the 2019 Algorithmic Accountability Act, it remains unclear whether it will gather sufficient\npolitical support to become law. The two acts also differ in style and depth. The EU AIA is a lengthy,\nsometimes opaque document that attempts to lay down rules for using ADS and provide details about\nhow these are to be enforced. In comparison, the US AAA takes a relatively high-level approach. It\ndefines critical terminology and stipulates requirements that owners of ADS must fulfil. However, it\ndelegates questions concerning implementation to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nIn short, the US AAA and the EU AIA spring from widely different political contexts and\nlegislative traditions. Despite these differences, comparing both the framing and the content of the\ntwo documents offers valuable insights. \u00b9 In previous works, we have highlighted both promising and\nchallenging aspects of the US AAA (see M\u00f6kander & Floridi, 2022), and the EU AIA (see M\u00f6kander et\nal., 2021), respectively. In this commentary, we go one step further by comparing the relative\nstrengths and limitations of the two proposals. We aim to address a simple yet pertinent question:\nwhat can the US AAA and the EU AIA learn from each other?"}, {"title": "Promising signs", "content": "The US AAA and the EU AIA have much in common. For example, neither act seeks to prohibit or limit\nthe use of ADS. Instead, they both aim to establish the governance infrastructure needed to hold bad\nactors accountable and allow actors with good intent to ensure and demonstrate that their ADS are\nethical, legal and safe. To that end, the US AAA requires organisations to perform impact assessments\nof (i) ADS before their deployment and (ii) augmented decision-making processes after the"}, {"title": "Unresolved tensions", "content": "Despite its many merits, the US AAA still leaves room for improvement. Next, we highlight three areas\nwhere it can be strengthened by learning from the EU AIA.\nFirst, the US AAA applies only to 'large companies' that either (a) have an annual turnover\nover $50 million, (b) have over $250 million in equity value, or (c) process the information of over 1\nmillion users. That exclusive focus on companies is unfortunate because many critical (and often\nautomated) decisions are made by government agencies that are outside the FTC's jurisdiction, such\nas ADS-based tools used by local governments to help determine which families should be\ninvestigated by child welfare agencies (Stapleton et al., 2022). Moreover, while the exception for\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is understandable, its current formulation in the bill is\nunhelpful. The cost of complying with new regulations tends to impact SMEs disproportionately. So,\npolicymakers should avoid raising the barriers to entry into already highly concentrated markets.\nHowever, not subjecting all ADS to the same transparency requirements exposes data subjects to\nunnecessary risks and could enable malicious actors to avoid regulatory oversight by outsourcing\ntasks via 'creative accounting'. Although the US AAA mentions that smaller corporations that are\n'substantially owned, operated, or controlled' by a 'large company' will have to follow these rules, it\nis unclear if simply contracting out automated decisions to smaller companies would be covered\nunder the legislation. The EU AIA offers a better model, placing consistent requirements on all ADS\nbut offering targeted support to SMEs to reduce their costs for ensuring and demonstrating\ncompliance (EU AIA, Article 55)."}, {"title": "Towards digital governance", "content": "Overall, the US AAA represents a pragmatic approach to the problem of managing the legal and\nethical challenges posed by ADS. The framing is sound, the proposed enforcement mechanisms are\nwell-established, and the bill explicitly seeks to balance the required regulatory oversight with\nincentives for innovation. Further, we acknowledge that many differences between the US AAA and\nthe EU AIA highlighted in this commentary result from differing political processes and legal traditions\n(Vokinger & Gasser, 2021).\nThat said, the current American effort to regulate ADS is too modest. After all, not only\n'consumers' but 'citizens' in general are increasingly affected by ADS. Moreover, a policy is only as\nstrong as the institutions backing it. While the EU AIA is part of a long-term, holistic effort by the EU\nto shape the digital ecosystem in the Union and beyond, the US AAA constitutes only a fragmented\nattempt. Following the introduction of the GDPR in 2016, a so-called 'Brussels effect' has been\nobserved, whereby multinational organisations choose to harmonise all their international data\nmanagement practices with EU laws for practical reasons (Bradford, 2020). The EU AIA may have a\nsimilar effect. In contrast, the impact of the US AAA \u2013 if it passes into law \u2013 would almost certainly be\nlimited without a more coordinated approach. Given the US's economic weight and technological\nleadership, it is regrettable that there may not be a 'Washington effect' positively shaping global\ndigital ecosystems.\nOn the one hand, recent developments suggest that the US is increasing efforts in tech\ndiplomacy. For example, the US and the EU have agreed to develop a joint roadmap on evaluation\nand measurement tools for trustworthy Al and risk management (EU-US Trade and Technology\nCouncil, 2022). On the other hand, it is still unclear whether the US AAA itself has any chance of\npassing, given that recent attempts at US versions of EU technology law, such as the American\nInnovation and Choice Online Act of 2022 (an analogue to the EU's Digital Markets Act) and the Data\nProtection Act of 2021 (an analogue to GDPR) have stalled in Congress. The current political\nlandscape in the US is not friendly to new technology regulation, with only two pieces of federal\ntechnology legislation passing in the last 25 years (Kang, 2022). Recent polling has shown that public\nsupport for more regulation of major technology companies has fallen from 56% of Americans in April\n2021 to 44% in May 2022 (Vogels, 2022). This, coupled with a divergence in partisan goals (e.g., the\nRepublicans focus on claims of discrimination against conservatives on social media and the\nDemocrats focus on claims of misinformation (Kang & McCabe, 2022)), makes it unlikely that the US"}]}

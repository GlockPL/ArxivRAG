A Digital Twin (DT) of an airport's full operations can play an important role in defending against cyberattacks by providing a secure virtual environment to model threats, test mitigations, and help ensure continuity of critical services [2, 3]. Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a disruptive approach in recent years, garnering increasing recognition. It has the potential to serve as a powerful virtual tool within the airport DT, enabling the modeling and testing of potential cyberattacks in sophisticated simulated scenarios [4]. This paper introduces the potential of DT as an assisting tool for airport applications pertaining to cyberattacks in general. It also highlights the advantages of utilizing GenAI within the DT context.\nDT is defined as a virtual representation of a physical product, system, or process in the real world [5]. It serves as an accurate and interchangeable digital counterpart for various practical purposes, including simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance [6]. A DT for Airport Operations Centre (APOC) in airports is a virtual representation of the entire airport ecosystem, encompassing its infrastructure, facilities, systems, and operations. GenAI refers to the capability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to produce text, images, videos, or other data through the use of generative models [7]. These models learn the patterns and structure of the input training data and subsequently generate new data that exhibits similar characteristics. GenAI is often prompted to create content based on specific inputs, allowing it to generate unique and relevant outputs [8]."}, {"title": "1.1 Background on Cyber Threats to Airports", "content": "Airports face growing and increasingly sophisticated threats due to their interdependence, digitization and role as nerve centers of regional connectivity. They are being attractive targets due to the vast amounts of sensitive data processed and the need to ensure smooth operations for safety, face various threats from sophisticated state actors to opportunistic criminal groups [1]. The pandemic lockdowns further exacerbated vulnerabilities as unpatched systems increased and remote work amplified phishing risks, often leading to unreported attacks [9]. The interconnectedness of Information technology (IT) / Operational Technology (OT) systems in airports means that a single breach can impact multiple tenants and partners, including airlines and transportation systems. However, the lack of standardized security practices across different airport authorities makes defending the ecosystem challenging and leaves individual gaps vulnerable.\nGeopolitical conflicts and tensions may also involve targeting airport infrastructure to cause economic or reputational damage to a nation. Despite airports' rising importance as logistical hubs, cyberdefense often takes a backseat to operational priorities, leaving them exposed. Legacy systems pose a unique challenge as they are difficult to patch and control, yet remain critical. The main cyber threats that airports face include ransomware attacks, destructive malware, Denial-Of-Service (DOS) and Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS) attacks, phishing and social engineering, insider threats, supply chain compromise, data exfiltration, ramp equipment hijacking, cyber-physical attacks, and disinformation campaigns [10, 11]. It is crucial to address these threats to ensure the resilience and smooth functioning of airports as national security priorities. In the past decade especially, many of the world's largest airports have faced disruptive or data-stealing cyberattacks largely due to their lack of coordinated digital defenses [12, 13]. There have been several significant cyberattacks on airports, highlighting the vulnerabilities they face in today's digital landscape. In October 2022, the online operations of over a dozen U.S. airport websites were compromised due to cyberattacks, which have been attributed to the Russian hacker group Killnet. In 2021, Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport experienced a ransomware attack that resulted in flight delays and check-in problems, with the attackers threatening to leak private data. In 2020, Los Angeles International Airport fell victim to cybercriminals who hijacked the public address system, broadcasting false evacuation orders to induce panic. London's Gatwick and Birmingham airports faced disruptions in 2019 when a malware infection affected digital signage and other displays, causing flight information issues for passengers.\nThe world's busiest air travel period in 2018 was marred by a ransomware attack on Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, leading to disruptions in check-in systems during the Thanksgiving holiday. In 2017, San Diego International Airport experienced a data breach that compromised the personal and financial information of 3.5 million individuals, attributed to an email phishing campaign. In 2016, security vulnerabilities were uncovered in the networks of New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and other major US airports, raising concerns about potential access to critical systems. In 2015, cyberespionage hackers targeted airline carrier networks, stealing data on 25 million passengers from five different carriers over an 18-month period. Finally, in 2013, Los Angeles International Airport fell victim to a hack that planted malware, linked to an advanced threat group with a focus on targeting US infrastructure. These incidents serve as stark reminders of the pressing need for robust cybersecurity measures in the aviation industry."}, {"title": "1.2 Overview of Airport Digital Twins and Generative AI Capabilities", "content": "Airport DTs provide a detailed and comprehensive overview of airport operations by collecting and integrating real-time data from various OT/IT systems such as security cameras, weather sensors, baggage handling equipment, and check-in kiosks.

Through these capabilities, the DT facilitates agile and data-driven recovery operations, ensuring effective coordination and optimized resource utilization among all stakeholders involved."}, {"title": "6.3 Coordinated Response Validation Across Agencies", "content": "An airport DT can greatly facilitate coordinated response validation across multiple agencies by leveraging its capabilities for modeling, simulation, and collaboration. The twin can model the interdependencies between airport operations and external response organizations, such as emergency services, police, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), to understand the intricate relationships and interactions [70", "29": ".", "52": ".", "48": 0.11}]}

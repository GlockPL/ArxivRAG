Originally observed in the erratic movement of pollen grains suspended in water by the botanist Robert Brown, it was later rigorously formalized by Norbert Wiener in the early 20th century. Brownian motion serves as a cornerstone in the modeling of various random phenomena, ranging from financial markets to the diffusion of particles in fluids.\nThis manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts, properties, and applications of Brownian motion. The exploration begins with a formal definition of Brownian motion and its fundamental properties, such as stationary independent increments and the Gaussian distribution of the process. Following the foundational aspects, the document delves into more advanced topics, including the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion, which decomposes a process with zero mean and finite variance into an orthonormal basis, and the reflection principle, which is a crucial result derived from the strong Markov property.\nFurthermore, the manuscript covers the non-differentiability of Brownian paths, illustrating the unique and sometimes counterintuitive nature of the process. The analysis of zero sets and local time provides deeper insights into the structure of paths and their occupation measures. Additionally, important theorems such as Blumenthal's 0-1 law, Donsker's theorem, and L\u00e9vy's characterization are discussed, each highlighting critical aspects of stochastic processes and their implications in various fields.\nOverall, these notes aim to equip the reader with a solid understanding of Brownian motion, from its theoretical underpinnings to its practical applications in modern science and engineering."}, {"title": "2 Definitions", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Brownian Motion", "content": "Definition 1 (Standard Brownian Motion (Liggett, 2010)).

The proof is postponed to Theorem 1.\nIt is convenient to take \u03a9 = C[0, \u221e), the space of all continuous functions w(\u00b7) on R+ or [0, \u221e). Note that if we simply take \u03a9 = R[0,\u221e) and its Borel o-algebra, then the set\nC = {w : B(t,w) is continuous in t.}\nis not even an event since it depends on uncountably many points. For \u03a9 = C[0,\u221e), the \u03c3-algebra is taken to be the Borel \u03c3-algebra, i.e., the smallest one for which the projection mapping w \u2192 w(t) is measurable for each t and we denote it as H. We have a family P = {P*} of probability measures indexed by x \u2208 R\u00b9 instead of a single probability measure. The measure P is the distribution of x + B(\u00b7) where B is a standard Brownian motion. The corresponding expectation is denoted by Ex. The probability triple is denoted by (\u03a9, H, P*). If in addition, we have a filtration F = {Ft : t > 0}, then the stochastic basis is the quadruple (\u03a9, H, F, P\u02da) (Dabrowska, 2020).\nLemma 1. Let \u03a9 = R[0,\u221e) and H be its Borel o-algebra. Then the set\nC = {w : B(t,w) is continuous in t.}\nis not even an event, i.e., C \u2209 H.\nProof. Define property (*): \u2203J countable s.t. if f \u2208 A, g \u2208 R[0,\u221e), then f|j = g|j implies g \u2208 A. Define the family of sets\nA = {A \u2286 R[0,\u221e) : A satisfies (*).}\nClearly Ba = \u03c0\u03b1\u00b9(B(R\u00ba)), is a subset of A (a finite and \u03c0\u03b1 is the projection from R[0,\u221e) to R\u00ba). But H is generated from Ba:\nH = \u03c3 (\u222aa finite \u03c0\u03b1\u00b9(B(R\u00ba))).\nSo if we can show that A is a \u03c3-algebra and C \u2209 A, then we are done.

Therein, the emphasis is often placed on the\ndegree or level of cooperation that a given mechanism can induce.\nHowever, these mechanisms typically involve costs that alter payoffs, either for the individuals\ninvolved in the interactions or for a third party (such as an institution) interested in promoting\ncooperation within the population. This can lead to a reduction in the overall social welfare\nof the population, broadly defined here as the total payoff of the population (Kaneko and\nNakamura, 1979), including all costs associated with inducing behavioral changes. For example,\nlet us consider peer incentives, where an agent can choose to pay a personal cost to decrease\n(peer punishment) or increase (peer reward) the payoff of the incentive recipient (Boyd et al.,\n2003, Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2002, Han, 2016, Sigmund et al., 2001). Typically (and intuitively), peer\npunishment is considered more efficient than peer reward as the former can lead to a higher level\nof cooperation, since peer punishers are more advantageous than peer rewarders when playing\nagainst defectors (see also our results in Figure 1). However, given that cooperative players gain\nan increase in payoffs when playing with rewarders, compared to no increase when playing with\npunishers, the overall population payoffs might be higher under peer reward even when it has\na lower level of cooperation. We discuss the importance of considering social welfare for other\nmechanisms of prosocial behaviours and for various real-world application domains in Discussion\n(Section 4).\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that it might be more important to optimise the social welfare,\nrather than focusing entirely on achieving highest levels of cooperation. Because the latter\ncan lead to a misleading, undesirable outcome where a high cooperation level is achieved but\nsocial welfare decreases. We demonstrate these through analysing social welfare for two well-\nestablished classes of incentive mechanisms: peer and institutional incentives, for both positive\n(i.e. reward) and negative (i.e. punishment) types (Duong and Han, 2021, Sasaki et al., 2015,\nSigmund et al., 2001, Van Lange et al., 2014).\nWe adopt Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) (Imhof et al., 2005, Sigmund, 2010, Smith,\n1974), a well-established mathematical framework for modelling and analysing cooperative be-\nhaviours and their emergence and stability (Nowak, 2006b, Perc et al., 2017). We derive close\nforms for the long-term expected social welfare, for population dynamics under varying mutation"}, {"title": "2 Model and Methods", "content": "We consider a well-mixed population where all players interact with each other via the one-\nshot Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, choosing whether to cooperate (C) or to defect (D), with\npayoffs given by the following payoff matrix:\nC\nD\n$C\\begin{pmatrix}\nR&S\\T&P\\end{pmatrix}$\nIf both interacting players follow the same strategy, they receive the same payoff: R for mutual\ncooperation and P for mutual defection. If the agents play different strategies, the cooperator\ngets the sucker's payoff S, and the defector gets the temptation to defect T. The payoff matrix\ncorresponds to the preferences associated with the PD when the parameters satisfy the ordering\nT>R>P> S (Coombs, 1973)."}, {"title": "2.2 Evolutionary processes", "content": "We consider an evolutionary process of a well-mixed, finite population of N interacting individ-\nuals (players).

In each time\nstep of the evolutionary process, an individual A is chosen at random to update their strategy.\nThere are two ways to do so: with probability \u03bc (mutation rate), A adopts a randomly selected\nstrategy from the remaining m 1 strategies.

Indeed, Figure 1 (left column) shows that, as expected, peer punishment usually sur-\npasses peer reward in effectively promoting cooperation, especially when selection is weaker and\nthe impact to cost ratio of incentive is sufficiently high. However, interestingly, reward leads to\nhigher social welfare than punishment in most cases\nFor peer reward, increasing efficiency leads to increase in social welfare in general. It is\nhowever not the case for punishment, where social welfare usually decreases with the impact to\ncost ratio. That is, applying peer punishment is often detrimental for social welfare.\nOverall, our results have shown that, in case of peer punishment, the objective of promoting\nthe evolution of high levels of cooperation can be detrimental for social welfare. Peer reward,\non the other hand, is more efficient in promoting social welfare, even though it leads to lower\nlevels of cooperation than punishment. The observations are robust for varying mutation rates,\nsee Figure S3.\nIt is noteworthy that our analysis focused on the minimal models of peer incentives, where\ncooperation is generally promoted for favourable conditions of incentives (i.e. sufficiently high\nimpact to cost ratio). These settings are suitable for the purpose of our study, as we aim to\ndemonstrate that achieving a high level cooperation could potentially be detrimental to social"}, {"title": "3.2 Institutional incentives", "content": "We now analyse the alignment between promoting cooperation and social welfare in minimal\nmodels of institutional reward and punishment (Duong and Han, 2021, G\u00f3is et al., 2019, Sasaki\net al., 2015). Namely, we consider a well-mixed population consisting of individuals playing the\none-shot PD game who can adopt either C or D in the interactions.\nThe social welfare now needs to take into account the cost for providing incentives spent by\nthe external institution for promoting cooperation. The institution might have different levels of\nefficiency using the budget, which can also be different for implementing reward or punishment.\nTo reward a cooperator (to punish a defector), the institution has to pay an amount 0/a\n(0/b, respectively) so that the cooperator's (defector's) payoff increases (decreases) by \u03b8, where\na, b > 0 are constants representing the efficiency ratios of providing this type of incentive.\nFigure 2 shows that, as expected (Duong and Han, 2021, G\u00f3is et al., 2019, Han, 2022b),\nboth types of incentives lead to the same level of cooperation assuming the are equally effective\n(i.e. a = b) and costly. However, institutional reward leads to positive social welfare (red areas\nin panels a and b) for a much wider range of incentive impact and cost. For reward, even when\nusing incentive is rather cost-inefficient, e.g. when a = 0.7 (panel c), positive social welfare can\nbe achieved for intermediate values of d. While for punishment, it needs to be highly efficient\n(b > 2) for positive social welfare. Our observation are robust for different intensities of selection,\nsee Supporting Information Figure S1.\nFor cost-efficient institutional reward (i.e., a > 1), it is best for social welfare to maximise\nthe impact (i.e. strong reward with a high per capital budget); for a = 1, the impact d needs to\nreach a certain threshold and then the performance levels up. For lower a, there is an optimal\nthreshold of & for highest social welfare.\nSufficiently strong institutional punishment (see panel c, with b = 3) can lead to positive\nsocial welfare, but even in this case it can be detrimental for social welfare when imposing a\nlarger impact on defectors. There is an optimal intermediate & for highest social welfare.\nThis is a notable observation as previous models of institutional incentives (G\u00f3is et al., 2019,\nSasaki et al., 2012, 2015, Sigmund et al., 2010) do not and are unable to provide insights on how\nstrong punishment is strong enough, focusing on promoting high levels of cooperation. In fact,\nprevious works only consider that strong punishment is needed to ensure cooperation."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Over the past decades, significant attention has been given to studying effective incentive mech-\nanisms that promote the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas (Novak, 2006, Perc et al.,\n2017, Sigmund, 2010). The emphasis is often placed on the extent of cooperation that a given\nmechanism can induce, and the conditions regarding the parameters involved. Since mutual\ncooperation is collectively more desirable than mutation defection, ensuring high levels of coop-\neration usually also leads to high population welfare.\nHowever, as these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is pos-\nsible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare. In\nthis paper, using numerical simulations for stochastic evolutionary models for two important\nincentive mechanisms, peer and institutional incentives, we have demonstrated exactly that.\nClosely related to the present work are a recent body of literature on cost optimisation of\ninstitutional incentives for promoting cooperation and fairness (Cimpeanu et al., 2023, Cimpeanu\nand Han, 2024, Cimpeanu et al., 2021, Duong et al., 2023, Duong and Han, 2021, Han and\nTran-Thanh, 2018, Sun et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2019, 2022). These works usually consider a bi-\nobjective optimisation problem where one aims to ensure a certain minimal level of cooperation\nat a smallest cost to the institution. While these works can provide insights on the optimal\nincentive policy, they still do not guarantee optimal social welfare. In fact, the two objectives\nare often misaligned (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). Moreover, we argue that focusing\non the social welfare provides a more convenient, single objective optimisation problem.\nWe analysed here two incentive mechanisms. It might be interesting to study whether\nmaximising social welfare is aligned with maximising cooperation for other mechanisms of co-\noperation. For example, with kin selection, favouring related players might lead to reduction of\nsocial welfare due to unfair use of power to favour or patronage one's relatives or friends (aka\nnepotism) (Wilson and Dugatkin, 1991). For indirect reciprocity to work (Okada, 2020), one\nmight need to enhance transparency of reputation, e.g. via implementing institution broadcast-\ning reputation scores (Radzvilavicius et al., 2021) or other costly communication mechanisms\n(Krellner et al., 2021, Santos et al., 2018). Thus one might need to balance between promoting\ncooperation and the cost of enabling it. For direct reciprocity to work (Xia et al., 2023), one"}]}

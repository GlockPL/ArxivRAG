Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the evolution of cooperation, such as kin and group selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, structured populations, pre-commitments and incentives (Novak, 2006, Perc et al., 2017). Therein, the emphasis is often placed on the degree or level of cooperation that a given mechanism can induce.\nHowever, these mechanisms typically involve costs that alter payoffs, either for the individuals involved in the interactions or for a third party (such as an institution) interested in promoting cooperation within the population. This can lead to a reduction in the overall social welfare of the population, broadly defined here as the total payoff of the population (Kaneko and Nakamura, 1979), including all costs associated with inducing behavioral changes. For example, let us consider peer incentives, where an agent can choose to pay a personal cost to decrease (peer punishment) or increase (peer reward) the payoff of the incentive recipient (Boyd et al., 2003, Fehr and G\u00e4chter, 2002, Han, 2016, Sigmund et al., 2001). Typically (and intuitively), peer punishment is considered more efficient than peer reward as the former can lead to a higher level of cooperation, since peer punishers are more advantageous than peer rewarders when playing against defectors (see also our results in Figure 1). However, given that cooperative players gain an increase in payoffs when playing with rewarders, compared to no increase when playing with punishers, the overall population payoffs might be higher under peer reward even when it has a lower level of cooperation. We discuss the importance of considering social welfare for other mechanisms of prosocial behaviours and for various real-world application domains in Discussion (Section 4).\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that it might be more important to optimise the social welfare, rather than focusing entirely on achieving highest levels of cooperation. Because the latter can lead to a misleading, undesirable outcome where a high cooperation level is achieved but social welfare decreases. We demonstrate these through analysing social welfare for two well-established classes of incentive mechanisms: peer and institutional incentives, for both positive (i.e. reward) and negative (i.e. punishment) types (Duong and Han, 2021, Sasaki et al., 2015, Sigmund et al., 2001, Van Lange et al., 2014).\nWe adopt Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) (Imhof et al., 2005, Sigmund, 2010, Smith, 1974), a well-established mathematical framework for modelling and analysing cooperative be-haviours and their emergence and stability (Nowak, 2006b, Perc et al., 2017).

Now, when optimising social welfare one also needs to take into account the costs spent by the third party.\nTo keep it general (institutional incentives that we analyse in the present work are a special case), we assume that at state n = ($n_1$,..., $n_m$), an institutional incentive budget $\u03b8_n$ can be used to promote a certain objective (e.g. maximising or ensure a certain threshold of the total frequency of cooperation). We write $\u03b8_n$ = $\\sum_i n_i\u03b8_i$, where $\u03b8_i$ is the per capita budget for strategist $i$ at state $n$, which can be used for either reward or punishment.\nWe denote $\u0398$ = {$\u03b8_n$}$_{n\u2208\u0394N_m}$ the overall incentive policy.

Indeed, Figure 1 (left column) shows that, as expected, peer punishment usually sur-passes peer reward in effectively promoting cooperation, especially when selection is weaker and the impact to cost ratio of incentive is sufficiently high. However, interestingly, reward leads to higher social welfare than punishment in most cases\nFor peer reward, increasing efficiency leads to increase in social welfare in general. It is however not the case for punishment, where social welfare usually decreases with the impact to cost ratio. That is, applying peer punishment is often detrimental for social welfare.\nOverall, our results have shown that, in case of peer punishment, the objective of promoting the evolution of high levels of cooperation can be detrimental for social welfare. Peer reward, on the other hand, is more efficient in promoting social welfare, even though it leads to lower levels of cooperation than punishment. The observations are robust for varying mutation rates, see Figure S3.\nIt is noteworthy that our analysis focused on the minimal models of peer incentives, where cooperation is generally promoted for favourable conditions of incentives (i.e. sufficiently high impact to cost ratio). These settings are suitable for the purpose of our study, as we aim to demonstrate that achieving a high level cooperation could potentially be detrimental to social"}, {"title": "3.2 Institutional incentives", "content": "We now analyse the alignment between promoting cooperation and social welfare in minimal models of institutional reward and punishment (Duong and Han, 2021, G\u00f3is et al., 2019, Sasaki et al., 2015). Namely, we consider a well-mixed population consisting of individuals playing the one-shot PD game who can adopt either C or D in the interactions.\nThe social welfare now needs to take into account the cost for providing incentives spent by the external institution for promoting cooperation. The institution might have different levels of efficiency using the budget, which can also be different for implementing reward or punishment.\nTo reward a cooperator (to punish a defector), the institution has to pay an amount $\u03b8/a$ ($\u03b8/b$, respectively) so that the cooperator's (defector's) payoff increases (decreases) by $\u03b8$, where a, b > 0 are constants representing the efficiency ratios of providing this type of incentive.\nFigure 2 shows that, as expected (Duong and Han, 2021, G\u00f3is et al., 2019, Han, 2022b), both types of incentives lead to the same level of cooperation assuming the are equally effective (i.e. a = b) and costly. However, institutional reward leads to positive social welfare (red areas in panels a and b) for a much wider range of incentive impact and cost. For reward, even when using incentive is rather cost-inefficient, e.g. when a = 0.7 (panel c), positive social welfare can be achieved for intermediate values of d. While for punishment, it needs to be highly efficient (b > 2) for positive social welfare. Our observation are robust for different intensities of selection, see Supporting Information Figure S1.\nFor cost-efficient institutional reward (i.e., a > 1), it is best for social welfare to maximise the impact (i.e. strong reward with a high per capital budget); for a = 1, the impact d needs to reach a certain threshold and then the performance levels up. For lower a, there is an optimal threshold of & for highest social welfare.\nSufficiently strong institutional punishment (see panel c, with b = 3) can lead to positive social welfare, but even in this case it can be detrimental for social welfare when imposing a larger impact on defectors. There is an optimal intermediate & for highest social welfare.\nThis is a notable observation as previous models of institutional incentives (G\u00f3is et al., 2019, Sasaki et al., 2012, 2015, Sigmund et al., 2010) do not and are unable to provide insights on how strong punishment is strong enough, focusing on promoting high levels of cooperation. In fact, previous works only consider that strong punishment is needed to ensure cooperation."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Over the past decades, significant attention has been given to studying effective incentive mech-anisms that promote the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas (Novak, 2006, Perc et al., 2017, Sigmund, 2010). The emphasis is often placed on the extent of cooperation that a given mechanism can induce, and the conditions regarding the parameters involved. Since mutual cooperation is collectively more desirable than mutation defection, ensuring high levels of coop-eration usually also leads to high population welfare.\nHowever, as these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is pos-sible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare. In this paper, using numerical simulations for stochastic evolutionary models for two important incentive mechanisms, peer and institutional incentives, we have demonstrated exactly that.\nClosely related to the present work are a recent body of literature on cost optimisation of institutional incentives for promoting cooperation and fairness (Cimpeanu et al., 2023, Cimpeanu and Han, 2024, Cimpeanu et al., 2021, Duong et al., 2023, Duong and Han, 2021, Han and Tran-Thanh, 2018, Sun et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2019, 2022). These works usually consider a bi-objective optimisation problem where one aims to ensure a certain minimal level of cooperation at a smallest cost to the institution. While these works can provide insights on the optimal incentive policy, they still do not guarantee optimal social welfare. In fact, the two objectives are often misaligned (see Supporting Information, Figure S2). Moreover, we argue that focusing on the social welfare provides a more convenient, single objective optimisation problem.\nWe analysed here two incentive mechanisms. It might be interesting to study whether maximising social welfare is aligned with maximising cooperation for other mechanisms of co-operation. For example, with kin selection, favouring related players might lead to reduction of social welfare due to unfair use of power to favour or patronage one's relatives or friends (aka nepotism) (Wilson and Dugatkin, 1991). For indirect reciprocity to work (Okada, 2020), one might need to enhance transparency of reputation, e.g. via implementing institution broadcast-ing reputation scores (Radzvilavicius et al., 2021) or other costly communication mechanisms (Krellner et al., 2021, Santos et al., 2018). Thus one might need to balance between promoting cooperation and the cost of enabling it. For direct reciprocity to work (Xia et al., 2023), one"}, {"title": null, "content": "might need to reduce noise, increase cognitive capacity (Han et al., 2012, Lenaerts et al., 2024), and improve trust (Han et al., 2021), which are costly and thus need to be taken into account for balancing the population social welfare. For pre-commitment to work (Nesse, 2001), it usually requires a third party such as an institution that provides incentives (Han, 2022b) or broadcast commitment-based reputation (Krellner and Han, 2023) for ensuring commitment compliance, which are costly and needed to be taken into account for enhanced social welfare.\nIt is noteworthy that our study focused on cooperation, but the same argument would be applicable for other prosocial behaviours such as coordination, trust, fairness, moral behaviour, technology safety development, collective risk avoidance and pandemic intervention compliance (Andras et al., 2018, Capraro and Perc, 2021, Cimpeanu et al., 2021, Han et al., 2020, Santos and Pacheco, 2011, Santos et al., 2006, Traulsen et al., 2023). It would be interesting to re-examine existing evolutionary mechanisms for such prosocial behaviours to see whether they promote social welfare.\nBeyond prosocial behaviours such as cooperation, it is often unclear or debatable which behaviour or social norm should be promoted. In these cases, using social welfare as the opti-misation objective can be particularly convenient, facilitating integrated decision-making that aims for the overall social good, especially in complex scenarios with multiple and sometimes conflicting priorities.\nSuch scenarios are common. For example, when designing public health programmes, deter-mining if vaccination should be the top priority can be challenging. Utilising social welfare as the objective allows policymakers to focus on the overall health and well-being of the population. Similarly, in education, opinions may differ on whether to prioritise STEM education, arts and humanities, vocational training, or critical thinking skills. Optimising for social welfare ensures the education system offers a balanced curriculum that supports the diverse talents and interests of students, fostering their overall development. Another example in environment domains with debates about prioritising the reduction of carbon emissions, the preservation of biodiversity, the promotion of renewable energy, or ensuring clean water access. By focusing on social welfare, environmental policies can be created to balance these various goals, resulting in comprehensive strategies that benefit both the environment and the population.\nAn important ongoing initiative in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research is the design and implementation of AI for social goods (Toma\u0161ev et al., 2020), using AI-based solutions for effectively addressing social problems. To this end, there is an emerging body of evolutionary modelling studies that address prosocial behaviours in hybrid systems of human and AI agents in co-presence (Capraro et al., 2024, Fern\u00e1ndez Domingos et al., 2022, Guo et al., 2023, Han, 2022a, Paiva et al., 2018, Santos, 2024, Shen et al., 2024, Zimmaro et al., ress).

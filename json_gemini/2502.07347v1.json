{"title": "Coarse Set Theory: A Mathematical Foundation\nfor Coarse Ethics", "authors": ["Takashi Izumo"], "abstract": "In ethical decision-making, individuals are often evaluated based on\ngeneralized assessments rather than precise individual performance. This\nconcept, known as Coarse Ethics (CE), has primarily been discussed in\nnatural language without a formal mathematical foundation. This pa-\nper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST) to establish a mathematical\nframework for CE. We define coarse sets using totally ordered sets and\npropose axioms that characterize the hierarchical relationships between\nelements and their groupings. Additionally, we introduce coarse-grained\nsets, which partition an underlying set into equivalence classes based on\npredefined criteria. We extend this framework by defining coarse map-\npings, which transform detailed individual data into coarser representa-\ntions while maintaining essential structural properties. To measure the\ninformation loss, we employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demon-\nstrating how different coarse partitions affect the preservation of informa-\ntion. We illustrate how CST can be applied to real-world grading systems\nthrough theoretical formulations and empirical analysis. This study pro-\nvides a rigorous foundation for CE, enabling a more systematic exploration\nof fairness, interpretability, and decision-making trade-offs.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In daily life, we sometimes assign the same evaluation to individuals who have\nachieved different results.

The statement that Olivia\nand Noah are Harvard University graduates also is an example of this evaluation\nmethod, where their specific academic performances during their enrollment\nare not considered. The study of such generalized evaluations and their ethical\nvalidity is known as Coarse Ethics (CE) [2][3].

Following PRISMA\nguidelines, this paper systematically reviews the formats and content of regulatory discussions on dark patterns\nfrom the interdisciplinary scholarship of Law and Human-Computer Interaction. A total of 65 studies were\nanalysed through content and thematic analysis. This study synthesises the unique trends and characteristics of\nlegal scholarship on dark patterns, identifying five root problems and triple layered harms. It critiques current\nregulations in terms of legal theories and sectoral legislations, highlighting their inadequacies in addressing dark\npatterns. The paper also critically examines existing proposed solutions, including paradigmatic shifts in legal\ndoctrines, refinements to existing frameworks, technical design-embedded solutions, and accountability\nmeasures for design practices. This research critically discusses the current barriers to effective dark pattern\nregulations and explores promising regulatory solutions. The difficulty in identifying the normative nature of\nvarious forms of dark patterns, in identifying evident and actionable harm, and the expanding scope of dark\npatterns' connotation inherently hinders effective regulation.

The uniqueness of dark patterns lies in the infinite and instant malleability of software\ninterfaces on online platforms, as design choices can be tweaked and updated through low-cost online\nexperiments and automation tools. Additionally, the vast scale of potential gains from the direct result of\nexpanding digitization and globalization stokes the prevalence and influence of dark patterns. Besides\ncommonly mentioned A/B testing, scholars also believe that technologies such as behavioural analytics, user\nprofiling and targeting, and even artificial intelligence have gradually endowed more power to dark patterns over\nusers. As information technology \"sits almost entirely outside conscious awareness,\" users seldom ponder the\ninner workings but still actively use it daily, dark patterns benefit from the same invisibility. Even though the\nscreens are tangible, designs that incentivise overuse and impulsive use remain invisible. Such invisibility of\ndark patterns has profound implications for long-term thinking, which may \"increase the risk that society will\nnot engage in interpretive flexibility\" and enables the technology to rapidly reach the phase of closure, at which\npoint few social reflections on the choices of design and use would occur.\""}, {"title": "Platform effect and digital market competition", "content": "Many legal researchers approach the dark pattern phenomenon by examining the roles and effects of platforms\nin the digital market and tend to view dark patterns as an abuse of platform (market) power.

Scholars typically explain how dark patterns are designed to make use of various heuristics in\nconditions of imperfect information, to exploit individuals' limited time, attention, and brainpower, to push them\nto adopt rules of thumb for efficiency and quick solutions, and to 'program them for specific behaviour' at the\ncost of their long-term best interest."}, {"title": "(Attention-seeking) Business models and Interest conflict", "content": "Tech companies' attention-seeking business models exploit human vulnerabilities in the digital economy, where\nattention is the primary currency.

People may remain unaware that they have\nbeen subjects of A/B testing and online experiments, and that this information is used to create and refine dark\npatterns. Ultimately, dark patterns utilising this information asymmetry enable vendors to have more or better\ninformation than users, creating other power imbalances that exploit consumers, such as in commercial\ntransactions.\nComparably, the asymmetry of design power is another assistor of dark patterns.

One specific harm\nrelated to the long-term effects of dark design patterns is addiction. It is claimed that companies have\nimplemented dark design patterns (e.g., gamification, reinforcement reward design) that cause users to become\naddicted to the product, leading to various mental health issues. Researchers particularly stress the amplification\nof damage to vulnerable groups such as children. Additionally, the recognition of harms shows regional\ndisparity: addiction as a harm of dark patterns tends to be recognized in the US, while such harm is not well-\nrecognized in the EU.\nLegal scholars tend to associate dark patterns with harms to human rights and common values, such as autonomy,\nprivacy, and fairness. In line with Gunawan et al.'s findings, almost all papers discuss, to some extent, the harm\nto individual autonomy or self-determination by impairing individuals' decision-making capacity.

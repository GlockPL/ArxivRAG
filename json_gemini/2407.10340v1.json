{"title": "Mapping the Scholarship of Dark Pattern Regulation: A Systematic Review of Concepts, Regulatory Paradigms, and Solutions from an Interdisciplinary Perspective", "authors": ["Weiwei Yi", "Zihao Li"], "abstract": "Dark patterns\u2014design tricks used on online interfaces to manipulate users' decision-making process\u2014have raised public concerns. However, research on regulation of dark pattern remains underdeveloped and scattered, particularly regarding scholars' views on the concept, regulatory paradigms, and solutions. Following PRISMA guidelines, this paper systematically reviews the formats and content of regulatory discussions on dark patterns from the interdisciplinary scholarship of Law and Human-Computer Interaction. A total of 65 studies were analysed through content and thematic analysis. This study synthesises the unique trends and characteristics of legal scholarship on dark patterns, identifying five root problems and triple layered harms. It critiques current regulations in terms of legal theories and sectoral legislations, highlighting their inadequacies in addressing dark patterns. The paper also critically examines existing proposed solutions, including paradigmatic shifts in legal doctrines, refinements to existing frameworks, technical design-embedded solutions, and accountability measures for design practices. This research critically discusses the current barriers to effective dark pattern regulations and explores promising regulatory solutions. The difficulty in identifying the normative nature of various forms of dark patterns, in identifying evident and actionable harm, and the expanding scope of dark patterns' connotation inherently hinders effective regulation. However, technical design-embedded solutions, accountability frameworks, and practical design guidelines offer potential routes for more proactive regulation, while legal pluralism stands as a promising macro-level change in regulatory paradigms for dark pattern regulation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In the digital age, people interact daily with online services through their online interface and system design.\nHowever, few scrutinise the deliberate design choices behind these interfaces. This lack of awareness is exploited by UI designers to create \"dark patterns\" 'tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something.'\u2014which causes various harms to consumer welfare, privacy, and beyond. Including well-recognized specific dark pattern types (e.g., Roach Motel, bait and switch, Trick questions), the overall dark pattern phenomenon is increasingly discussed against the bigger backdrop of a socio-technological approach to technology and under the issue of modifications to users' choice architecture in and beyond the context of user interfaces.\nMore recently, dark patterns have increasingly become a subject of discussion among regulators and legal researchers. Yet, despite the rapid growth of studies on dark patterns, particularly in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), researchers primarily focus is limited to identifying dark patterns across different contexts and refining taxonomies, paying less attention to normative evaluations and regulatory discussions.\nThis is because dark patterns affect a broad spectrum of interests and values protected by various laws, yet existing regulatory frameworks have proven inadequate in addressing them effectively. As will be demonstrate later through the review, one of the major challenges lies in the inherent ambiguity of the concept of \"dark patterns\" that complexify further regulatory discourse. Additionally, while privacy concerns are often at the forefront of regulatory efforts, other crucial aspects such as consumer protection, competition are frequently receive less attention. Meanwhile, what consists of, and the alleged effectiveness, of the existing regulatory solutions remains clouded. In sum, research on how dark pattern regulation is portrayed by these researchers remains underdeveloped and warrants a comprehensive and interdisciplinary review.

For example, reviews led by HCI researchers have conducted scoping reviews focusing on definitions, taxonomies, and normative theories, where discussions on regulations were limitedly touched upon, or focused solely on empirical research, or on research frameworks where argumentative discussion on regulations were excluded. In existing organization-led reviews on dark patterns, either the relevance of results on dark patterns was jeopardized by the over-inclusion of other terms (e.g., Manipulative Persuasion) in the data search, or the systematic review did not comprehensively address the regulations considering sectoral and paradigmatic differences between regulations.

Comparatively, among the 15 HCI papers, the majority are likely to be taxonomy-building (33.34%) for instance, synthesizing a collective multi-layer taxonomy of dark patterns using regulatory and academic literature, or identifying new types of dark patterns in multi-modality or live stream e-commerce. Papers with descriptive framing or detection-focused are fewer (each at 13.3%), while only 6.6% are experimental/causal, and none are evaluative. Additionally, we identify theoretical papers (20%) that do not contain empirical elements. Therefore, similar to Gray et al.'s review of HCI empirical scholarship, our findings also reflect the diversity of framing contributions within dark pattern literature, although we observe more taxonomy-building framing and no evaluative framings in our data. However, considering that regulatory discussions are likely to be relatively independent additions in the discussion sections, it remains to be confirmed whether there is any pattern of relevance between the substantiality of regulatory discussions and the frames and aims of a study.

For example, dark design patterns are being examined in non-traditional interfaces such as voice and gesture-based systems and virtual reality. These discussions explore how customization and user profiling could enhance the influence of dark patterns by targeting specific vulnerabilities of individuals or groups. Additionally, elements like loot boxes in video games are identified as dark patterns that could be intensified through gamer profiling. The intertwining of dark patterns with Al is noteworthy, with some researchers discussing 'second-generation dark patterns' employed by Al to create 'hypernudges,' or referring to the 'unacceptable risk systems' under the proposed EU AI Act as 'dark pattern systems'. This broader understanding of dark patterns aligns with HCI researchers' views on advanced personalised UIs as the future of dark patterns, moving beyond the basic forms currently prevalent and exploited by companies."}, {"title": "3.2.3 What are the root problems/causes of dark patterns?", "content": "Through thematic analysis, we identify five root problems in this section that either derive from or catalyse the dark pattern problem: invisibility of digital design, platform effect and digital market competition, human bias and vulnerability, (attention-seeking) business models & interest conflict, and power imbalance over information and design."}, {"title": "Invisibility of digital design", "content": "It is commonly acknowledged that the online environment is an indispensable contextual component of dark pattern practices. The uniqueness of dark patterns lies in the infinite and instant malleability of software interfaces on online platforms, as design choices can be tweaked and updated through low-cost online experiments and automation tools. Additionally, the vast scale of potential gains from the direct result of expanding digitization and globalization stokes the prevalence and influence of dark patterns. Besides commonly mentioned A/B testing, scholars also believe that technologies such as behavioural analytics, user profiling and targeting, and even artificial intelligence have gradually endowed more power to dark patterns over users. As information technology \"sits almost entirely outside conscious awareness,\" users seldom ponder the inner workings but still actively use it daily, dark patterns benefit from the same invisibility. Even though the screens are tangible, designs that incentivise overuse and impulsive use remain invisible. Such invisibility of dark patterns has profound implications for long-term thinking, which may \"increase the risk that society will not engage in interpretive flexibility\" and enables the technology to rapidly reach the phase of closure, at which point few social reflections on the choices of design and use would occur.\""}, {"title": "Platform effect and digital market competition", "content": "Many legal researchers approach the dark pattern phenomenon by examining the roles and effects of platforms in the digital market and tend to view dark patterns as an abuse of platform (market) power. Compared to their brick-and-mortar counterparts, digital platforms are different as they benefit from fewer reputational concerns and competitive pressures since users commonly face inferior exit options and greater lock-in due to their investment in these platforms, and from little regulation regarding their harmful practices on consumers."}, {"title": "Human bias and vulnerability", "content": "Bounded rationality, which links to more normative concepts like 'human bias' and 'vulnerabilities', is commonly recognized as the fundamental concept to understand the effectiveness of dark patterns. The theories sometimes referred to by legal researchers are the dual-system theory by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, or the nudge theory (including discussions of \u2018choice architecture', 'liberal paternalism', and 'nudge and sludge') by Thaler and Sunstein. Scholars typically explain how dark patterns are designed to make use of various heuristics in conditions of imperfect information, to exploit individuals' limited time, attention, and brainpower, to push them to adopt rules of thumb for efficiency and quick solutions, and to 'program them for specific behaviour' at the cost of their long-term best interest."}, {"title": "(Attention-seeking) Business models and Interest conflict", "content": "Tech companies' attention-seeking business models exploit human vulnerabilities in the digital economy, where attention is the primary currency. Platforms often offer low-cost or free services to attract attention, designing interfaces that nudge or hook users, creating addiction through dopamine rushes. This increases user engagement on the platform, facilitating greater personal data collection and ad sales.\nMeanwhile, the interest conflict between users and service providers is increasingly recognised as the main reason for the emergence and expansion of dark patterns. Dark patterns arise as digital platforms do not hold the best interests of users in mind and show indifference, if not outright exploitation, towards users' privacy and"}, {"title": "Derivative problems: Power asymmetry over information and design", "content": "The imbalanced power of information underpins the potency of dark patterns. Consumer data collected by platforms is the main source of the growing knowledge on individuals and groups that exacerbates the information imbalance and transforms into powers of manipulation. People may remain unaware that they have been subjects of A/B testing and online experiments, and that this information is used to create and refine dark patterns. Ultimately, dark patterns utilising this information asymmetry enable vendors to have more or better information than users, creating other power imbalances that exploit consumers, such as in commercial transactions.\nComparably, the asymmetry of design power is another assistor of dark patterns. Even though it is gradually understood that 'Design is everything...[D]esign is power', it is usually the platforms that hold the design power and act as choice architects, intentionally configuring how choices are presented and thus imposing significant impacts on user decision-making. Platforms are given 'too much power', regarding the implementation, and this power imbalance results in practices ranging from nudging users to overlook cookie policies to implanting more complex dark patterns. Such design power imbalance is continuously exacerbated as power continues being concentrated in a handful of technology companies, leading to weakened user participation and negotiation over feasible design alternatives.\nConsequently, these observed factors collectively result in the emergence and prevalence of dark patterns in the digital environment.

The harm to individual decision-making ability by imposing labour or cognitive burdens is extensively recognized, typically taking the form of constant distractions of attention, lengthy times required to complete tasks, and emotional distress, among others. Comparatively, monetary harm is less emphasised in legal scholarship than in HCI scholarship. One specific harm related to the long-term effects of dark design patterns is addiction. It is claimed that companies have implemented dark design patterns (e.g., gamification, reinforcement reward design) that cause users to become addicted to the product, leading to various mental health issues. Researchers particularly stress the amplification of damage to vulnerable groups such as children. Additionally, the recognition of harms shows regional disparity: addiction as a harm of dark patterns tends to be recognized in the US, while such harm is not well-recognized in the EU.\nLegal scholars tend to associate dark patterns with harms to human rights and common values, such as autonomy, privacy, and fairness. In line with Gunawan et al.'s findings, almost all papers discuss, to some extent, the harm to individual autonomy or self-determination by impairing individuals' decision-making capacity. Harm to privacy ranges from well-known cases of consent interface designs to the nascent case of private sphere surveillance. Harms to the value of fairness between traders and consumers are also commonly discussed, alongside evaluations of consumer protection frameworks."}, {"title": "3.2.4.2 Harms to the market and competition", "content": "Discussion of harms from market and competition perspectives has grown since Mathur et al.'s review. Some researchers argue that the harm to market competition stems from dark patterns interfering with market participants' (consumers') decision-making processes in transactions, which subsequently results in reduced market efficiency that accumulates into anti-competitive effects and harms consumer welfare and market trust, especially when dark patterns are deployed by players with market power."}, {"title": "3.2.4.3 Harm to society", "content": "Dark patterns' harm to society primarily originates from their disruption to the effective functioning of laws. For instance, in the context of privacy and data protection, dark patterns compromise the consent mechanism, which is central to contemporary privacy and data protection regimes. It is important to note that dark patterns can also subvert other regulatory objectives beyond the commonly acknowledged protection of consumer welfare or privacy. For example, dark design patterns used by Facebook in the platform's reporting procedures for hate speech and terrorist content have imposed a series of redirections and obstructions on reporters, degrading the implementation of Germany's Network Enforcement Act, which may jeopardise democracy and national security. From a broader perspective, it is believed that 'dark patterns distract from two of the central objectives of the European Union's digital single market: creating the right conditions and a level playing field for digital networks and innovative services to flourish and maximise the growth potential of the digital economy'. Additionally, some researchers believe that dark patterns undermine individuals' capacity for self-government and their ability to pursue their own goals, further harming democracy at a fundamental level., Others discuss how dark design patterns in games (e.g., 'loot boxes') resemble unrestricted gambling in reality, and how these design mechanisms could lead to similar negative externalities in society."}, {"title": "3.3 How do the papers engage with regulatory discourse of dark patterns?", "content": "In this section, we review all papers to provide a concise overview of the legal and regulatory discourse on dark patterns, beginning with the regulations involved, identifying related problems, and concluding with proposed solutions."}, {"title": "3.3.1 The regulations regarding dark patterns mainly discussed", "content": "We identify seven clusters of laws, among them data protection and privacy law (n=27) and consumer protection law (n=27)-are widely recognized as crucial for regulating dark patterns, with Competition law next (n=12). Contract law and fundamental laws being less touched upon (each n=5). Discussions on contract law mainly focus on the theory of contracting that questions the nature of consent to privacy policies concerning dark patterns or proposing a private law solution to dark patterns from the perspective of contract law. Meanwhile, fundamental rights are sometimes mentioned either to show how human rights (e.g., the right to data protection) are infringed by dark patterns, or how the regulation of dark patterns might face obstructions from the US First Amendment concerning commercial speech.\nThere is a small number of other laws seen as viable regulations as potential tools for reigning in dark patterns (n=12), such as gambling law, intellectual property law, tort law including product liability law, financial law, health insurance law, and corporate law. Moreover, many papers express expectations for the EU digital strategy package (n=7), particularly the Digital Services Act (DSA), Digital Markets Act (DMA), Data Act, and Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), regarding more effective regulation of dark patterns and other computational manipulative practices.\nHowever, even though there is a comparable number of research from a consumer protection perspective, empirical studies on dark patterns from a consumer welfare protection perspective are less researched, and there is no empirical research from a competition law perspective. Therefore, further research on dark patterns could benefit from more empirical studies about the effects on platform markets and consumer welfare."}, {"title": "3.3.2 What are the identified problems of the corresponding regulations?", "content": "The fuzzy boundaries between concepts (theories of law)\nThe differentiation between concepts of persuasion, manipulation, deception, coercion, and similar has been an unsettled upstream issue. It is realized that regulators must make difficult decisions regarding where the line lies precisely between these concepts in the context of dark design patterns, to eliminate problematic conduct from the market without overregulation. Although dark patterns are commonly recognised as having crossed the line of proper persuasion, scholars approach the conundrum of concepts differently.\nSome researchers define manipulation as hidden influences, including deception, as opposed to overt influences like persuasion and coercion. Others predominantly focus on complexity between persuasion and manipulation, or examine deception and dark patterns of a deceptive nature to avoid the issue of when marketing becomes unfair or abusive manipulation. Some view dark patterns as coercions forcing users to spend attention, data, and money in the digital economy, exploring when persuasive and manipulative design becomes coercive in digital market competition. These inconsistent approaches increase the difficulty in capturing the nature of dark patterns, which is plausibly vital for normative evaluation (See Section 4.1.1.) and results in equivocal use of terms (e.g., 'deceptive designs/patterns' or 'manipulative designs/patterns') or 'dark patterns'.\nThe problem of the types and levels of \u2018harm\u02bc (Theories of law)\nWhen the conceptual boundaries between legitimate persuasion and problematic manipulation, deception, and coercion are unclear, evaluating the harm of dark patterns becomes challenging.

When dark patterns are backed by profiling and algorithmic personalization and go beyond uniform UI choice architecture, the outdated dichotomy of average/vulnerable consumers in consumer protection laws is identified as the crux. Building on the previous section on bounded rationality, it is increasingly recognized that the vulnerabilities of individual consumers may also be contextual and influenced by external factors, leading to the obsolescence of the traditional consumer protection rationale. When dark patterns are supported by group or individual algorithmic profiling, the distinction between average and vulnerable consumers dissolves, making every consumer vulnerable as accurate detection (and even incubation) and exploitation of vulnerabilities can be easily achieved."}, {"title": "The problem of the consent mechanism & individual approach to data regulation (Data protection and privacy law)", "content": "In the realm of data protection and privacy law, topics of dark patterns on consent management interfaces and their effects dominate empirical studies. The over-reliance on consent mechanisms has been criticized from many aspects. A convincing point is that, even without dark patterns, the mere repetition of dealing with different consent interfaces daily leads to consent fatigue, which undermines the informed consent mechanism intended by legislators ('fatigue by design').. This consent fatigue is damaging as companies can circumvent consent with even minor dark patterns. Others reiterate the indifference to the bounded rationality issue in data protection law, as policymakers fall into the 'consent fallacy', assuming people would always make decisions rationally and in their best interest with the provided information. However, people do not possess unbounded rationality, nor can they manage the full burden of information flows on data practices thoroughly, while the proliferation of dark patterns pushes the limits of the consent approach."}, {"title": "The outdated theory of competition law, misposition of platform power (Competition Law)", "content": "The problems of competition law identified are more diverse.

A key emerging issue is whether the new laws can effectively address dark patterns influenced or driven by AI. Cohen criticizes the EU Al Act's overemphasis on subliminal techniques, which are non-perceptible and highly ambiguous. It argues that the real issue with manipulative Al involves attention distraction and awareness deprivation. Such abilities of Al share similarities with the essential characteristics of current dark patterns that manipulate human attentional processes, and Al can 'purposefully pull a viewer's attention toward certain visual stimuli to prevent them from attending to others,' blurring the line between unattended and imperceptible, and leading to an unreliable boundary between subliminal and non-subliminal techniques.\nMore importantly, this ability of AI aligns with the basic logic behind dark design patterns on websites. With the power of machine learning models, dark patterns are expected to evolve into uniform dark patterns targeting the most susceptible (vulnerable) times, or 'dynamically personalise a digital environment based on individual-level biases and vulnerabilities to inattention'.

Among these, some advocate for lex specialis, specifically targeting dark patterns. The proposed US Deceptive Experiences to Online Users Reduction (DETOUR) Act aims to curb manipulative dark pattern behaviour by prohibiting large online platforms from using user interfaces that intentionally impair user autonomy, decision-making, or choice. The bill encourages promising regulatory initiatives, such as empowering the FTC to support a registered standard body that issues guidelines for platform design practices, oversees platforms' routine disclosure of behavioural experiments, and the establishment of independent review boards. Griffin similarly proposes a specialized law targeting manipulative designs by 'systematically important platforms', introducing protective default settings, enhanced user controls through service feature disaggregation (e.g., disabling loot boxes and timed regenerations in games), and imposing extra taxes on manipulative design practices.\nAnother approach involves updating competition law theories and follow-up policies to control platform powers. Marks introduces the concept of 'biopower' and discusses how platforms harness biopower through unregulated conglomerates, concentric mergers, and surveillance control networks to influence social norms. He advocates for expanding the 'consumer welfare' concept and revitalizing merger control to collectively evaluate data flows, biopower, and coercive choice architectures, including dark patterns.

As specified previously, the extent to which dark patterns are persuasive, manipulative, deceptive, or coercive is not well- defined. However, clarifying the normative nature of different dark patterns is crucial as they underpin the existing regulatory framework. Consumer protection law depends on interpreting deception (e.g., 'misleading commercial practices' in UCPD and \u2018deceptive acts or practices' in FTC Act) and, to some extent, coercion ('aggressive commercial practices' in UCPD and 'unfair acts or practices' in FTC Act). Moreover, interpreting coercion is essential to justify interventions from competition law. Unfortunately, despite frequent references to 'manipulative' or 'deceptive designs' as synonyms for dark patterns, explicit concept differentiation is lacking in existing laws addressing dark patterns, creating a barrier to regulation.\nSeveral factors contribute to this normative ambiguity. Firstly, even theoretically, the differentiation of these concepts is unresolved. Secondly, dark patterns, by nature, are a collective and thematic concept; some types may be deceptive (e.g., sneaking into baskets, disguised ads) while others are coercive (e.g., nagging). More importantly, considering the rapid evolution and diversification of dark patterns, case-by-case determination of their normative natures, especially in ex-post paradigms, could increase the regulatory resource burden.

Therefore, S\u00e1nchez Chamorro et al. criticize the amalgamation of definitions and terms used to describe 'dark patterns' and suggest shifting the discussion to a more precise term such as 'manipulative"}, {"title": "4.2 Promising technical and regulatory solutions", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.2.1 Compatible technical solutions and design accountability check frameworks", "content": "Despite the inherent conceptual problems of dark patterns that make current regulations appear ineffective, our findings on proposed solutions highlight promising routes to more effective future regulation. These solutions"}, {"title": "4.2.2 Practical design guidelines cross regimes", "content": "The criticisms regarding the sufficiency of existing regulations converge on the uncertainty of how to determine whether a design employs dark patterns, leading to a common call for clear guidelines/guidance on assessment or design. For instance, industry-led ethical design guidelines of a self-regulation nature could serve as a baseline in courts to determine whether 'professional diligence' is fulfilled, according to which a design can be judged as 'unfair' ('dark') or not under UCPD. Similarly, such guidelines can take other forms (e.g., Code of Conduct, Guidance, Recommendations) issued directly by authorities. Fortunately, this is an ongoing movement in the EU (e.g., EDPB Guideline 2022) and we expect to see more according to Art 25(3) DSA. The only caveat is that regulators need to evaluate and scrutinize the quality and compliance of industry-led guidance (self-regulation), considering the inherent interest conflict.\nIt is worth highlighting that the line between what is appropriate design versus dark design is not fixed and permanent. According to Bernstein's theory on the window of reshaping technology, the status of no regulation"}, {"title": "4.3 Legal pluralism as a potential direction", "content": "To develop more effective regulation against the backdrop of uncertainties surrounding dark patterns, it is essential to adopt a comprehensive regulatory paradigm. Essentially, dark patterns represent the under- scrutinized unilateral power of design in digital choice architecture, which has been widely recognized at the UI level, compared to the emerging use of the term in a more systemic level and broader context. Even without considering the expansion of the connotation of dark patterns and the inherent uncertainty of the term 'dark patterns', the findings section of the paper already demonstrates that the harm caused by dark patterns impacts various legal interests and values addressed by different regulatory mechanisms. However, the current regulatory system remains limited both theoretically and in terms of its outdated approach to tasks. For example, it is challenging to differentiate between concepts, including persuasion and manipulation, and to evaluate the types and levels of harm caused by dark patterns. Meanwhile, outdated consumer protection frameworks that are not designed for algorithmic personalization, over-reliance on consent mechanisms in data protection and privacy laws, and inadequate competition laws that fail to address digital manipulations contribute to the ineffectiveness of the current regulatory landscape.\nWhile both HCI and legal scholarship endeavour to grapple with these issues, a more comprehensive framework is required to take advantage of both strengths. In this sense, the power of design highlighted by Woodrow Harzog further speaks to Lessig's theory of 'Code is law', which calls for recognition of the fact that technologies also reflect value and calls for a shift in societal mindset to recognize the need for collaboration between technology and regulations to ensure commonly recognized values in cyberspace. Such legal pluralism can effectively bridge the gap between technological advancements and regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the harmful impacts of dark patterns are mitigated. Accordingly, regulating dark patterns would not only require collaboration between different legislative frameworks, regardless of whether it's data protection and privacy law, consumer protection law, or even competition law, but also necessitate focusing on core legal objectives. These objectives are not merely to distinguish between 'data subjects' and 'consumers' but to harness the"}, {"title": "5 Limitations", "content": "Despite the review choosing the most pertinent keywords of dark patterns and disciplines for database searching, some pertinent papers might not be enlisted due to the different use of terms or indexing of disciplines. Additionally, as we only focus on English-written scholarship, this article might not reflect dark patterns of research written in another different linguistic background. Meanwhile, the difficulty in tagging some papers, especially those HCI researcher-led papers to which law researchers substantially contributed, as either law or HCI due to the ongoing deepening collaboration in dark pattern research from an interdisciplinary perspective, and consequently, our strategic inclusion of these papers as law papers to enrich our analysis may, from another perspective, leading to less heterogenous findings for RQ2. We did not systematically identify the actors (e.g., platforms, designers, legislators and enforcers) involved in dark pattern regulation and the proposed responsibilities upon them, which may be suitable for future research on a more micro and practical level."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we systematically reviewed research on dark pattern regulation across HCI and legal fields using mixed analysis methods. Our research highlights the diverse framing contributions and contextual themes within the literature on dark pattern regulations across disciplines. We found that legal papers heavily rely on definitions from HCI scholarship and recently attempt to adopt an expansive interpretation of the dark pattern concept to systemic issues. This paper delineates legal scholars' views on the root problems of dark pattern practices and demonstrates how dark patterns are entrenched in the digital environment, extending beyond mere online replications of offline unfair practices."}, {"title": "7 Appendix", "content": "Codebook for content analysis:"}]}

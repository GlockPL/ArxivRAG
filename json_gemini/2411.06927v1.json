To alleviate this limitation, the minimum variance method based on the least-mean-square criterion was proposed to improve the spatial resolving power [13]. However, achieving high-precision estimation with it required higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and a greater number of snapshots. Subsequently, the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method [14], the rotation-invariant subspace (ESPRIT) method [15], and various efficient derivative algorithms [16], such as the root-MUSIC, were proposed.

Deep learning-based methods", "content": "With the advancement of deep learning (DL) [27]\u2013[29], DL-based DOA estimation methods have emerged as a new research hotspot. The DOA estimation problem can be transformed into a neural network classification issue, where the network learns the mapping relationship between the input data and the DOA to classify spatial angles. Alternatively, it can be approached as a neural network regression problem. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the computational efficiency of DL-based DOA estimation algorithms has significantly improved.\nFully connected neural network (FCNN) [30], [31] has been widely used in DOA estimation and related fields, but its large number of matrix multiplication operations resulted in high computational costs. Consequently, convolutional neural network (CNN), which uses convolutional operations instead of matrix multiplication in FCNN, have gradually emerged in the field of DOA estimation. [32] used CNN to estimate the noiseless covariance matrix of the generalized ULA and retrieved the DOA using root-MUSIC, thereby overcoming the grid mismatch issues encountered with grid-based methods. Moreover, improved CNN-based networks have been introduced to further enhance the DOA estimation performance. A multi-branch convolutional recurrent neural network with residual links and a weighted noise subspace network were introduced in [33] to improve the covariance matrix estimation, subspace partitioning, and peak-finding processes. Subsequently, multi-stage neural network-based DOA estimation was proposed to address the limitation of single neural networks in generalizing across all conditions. For example, a cascade neural network was proposed in [34] with two stages: the first stage used a CNN to obtain an initial DOA value, and the second stage used an FCNN to generate a tuning vector representing the difference between the true DOA and the closest discretization angle. The final DOA estimation was then obtained by adjusting the initial DOA estimate using the tuning vector. In [35], a cascade off-grid"}, {"title": "C. Motivations and contributions", "content": "Although the methods analyzed above can better balance the relationship between resolution, estimation accuracy, and computational complexity to improve DOA estimation performance at low SNR and with a small number of snapshots. However, most of the current studies conduct experimental validation using ideal target incident angles while neglecting noise. The ideal angle is difficult to realize because noise always exists in real communication. Moreover, directly using the angles estimated from advanced DOA methods, like root-MUSIC or DL, to calculate weighted coefficients can result in certain performance loss. Therefore, we will focus on how to implement a more practical, low-cost, high-performance as well as high time-efficiency passive DOA estimator.

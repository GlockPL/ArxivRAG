Mental health professionals are increasingly recognizing the utility of data derived from social media platforms such as Twitter. However, high dimensionality and extensive feature sets of Twitter data present remarkable challenges for ED classification. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel method, an informed branch and bound search technique known as ED-Filter. This strategy significantly improves the drawbacks of conventional feature selection algorithms such as filters and wrappers. ED-Filter iteratively identifies an optimal set of promising features that maximize the eating disorder classification accuracy. In order to adapt to the dynamic nature of Twitter ED data, we enhance the ED-Filter with a hybrid greedy-based deep learning algorithm. This algorithm swiftly identifies sub-optimal features to accommodate the ever-evolving data landscape. Experimental results on Twitter eating disorder data affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of ED-Filter. The method demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and proves its value in eating disorder detection on social media platforms.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Eating disorders (ED) have emerged as a profound concern in contemporary mental health research [1-3]. A growing body of literature attests to the alarming statistic that over 20 percent of Australian adolescents experience some manifestation of eating disorder [4, 5]. Conditions such as Anorexia Nervosa carry pronounced life-threatening implications, while others may precipitate prolonged mental and physiological complications [6, 7]. Coinciding with the digital age, platforms like Twitter (officially known as X since 2023) have seen a proliferation of communities, termed as pro-eating disorder (Pro-ED), which disseminate content promoting and idealizing these disorders [8-10]. Such communities harness the digital milieu to endorse an ethos of thinness and rigorous dieting, inadvertently guiding susceptible populations towards maladaptive eating practices [11, 12].\nHowever, existing ED classification methods grapple with the multidimensionality and extensive feature set intrinsic to Twitter data. Such complexities not only pose challenges in data extraction but also lead to performance inefficiencies in ED classification, attributable to the high dimensionality and the presence of unreliable features [13]. Twitter, emblematic of vast social media platforms, offers a plethora of information that could yield invaluable insights into the dynamics of Pro-ED discourses [14, 15]. Yet, the inherent intricacies in this data necessitate an advanced mechanism for its curation, management, and transformation [16, 17]. Preliminary identifiers like hashtags #proana and #thinspiration might serve as initial markers [18, 19], but the overarching challenge remains: developing a robust analytical framework that can efficiently navigate the multidimensional space, ensuring accurate ED classification while filtering out unreliable features.\nExample: Assuming we have two users who post ED-related messages on Twitter, with the following keywords to check within their posts\nK= {body, weight, food, meal, exercise, thinspo, suicide, depressed}. We\nthen count the occurrences of each keyword within the users' tweets and\nstore these values in separate data rows for each user as follows: (a)\nT\u2081 (2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0), and (b) T2(0,0,5,3,0,0,0,0). Assuming we have four\ngroups: {body-image, food, inspiration, symptoms} for classification. The rela-\ntionship between the four groups and the keywords in K are as follows:\n{body-image: body, weight}, {food: food,meal}, {inspiration : exercise, thinspo},\nand {symptoms : suicide, depressed}. Finally, we can classify the T\u2081 (2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\ninto body-image and T2(0,0,5,3,0,0,0,0) into food.\nFeature selection is an important pre-processing step for classification tasks, which\nis frequently adopted to reduce the high dimensional data [22-24]. The feature selec-\ntion improves the performance of the classification models by removing irrelevant\nfeatures [25, 26]. In feature selection, we aim to compute the optimal feature subset\nwhich maintains the characteristics of the original data. When the dimensionality of\na problem grows, the feature set becomes larger. As a result, computing the optimal\nfeature subset becomes intractable and NP-hard [27]. In summary, the feature selec-\ntion contains four steps: (a) subset creation, (b) subset evaluation, (c) termination\ncondition check, and (d) result assessment. Feature selection has numerous applica-\ntions such as in text mining [28], data exploration [29-31], intrusion detection [32],\nimage classification [33], bio-informatics [34, 35], and so on.\nThe feature selection techniques are mainly categorized into two important groups:\n(a) the filters [36] and (b) the wrappers [37]. The wrappers employ the predictive model\nperformance and cross-validation to rank the features and select the most reliable\nfeature set. The wrappers employ a particular classifier to assess the merit of the\nfeature subsets and to compute the optimal feature subset. Therefore, the wrappers\nare more computationally expensive and slower than the filters. Furthermore, the\nwrappers guarantee better effectiveness than the filters since they assess the accuracy\nof the classifier to determine the optimal feature subset. However, the filters apply\nstatistical techniques such as information gain and variance to rank the features. The\nfilters utilize the internal information of a dataset to compute the relevance degree of\nthe features to select the most promising feature subset. These filter methods avoid the\noptimization process which is done in the wrappers techniques. That is why the filters\nare faster and less costly in comparison with their wrappers counterparts. However, the\nfilters accuracy in feature ranking is not as reliable as the wrappers. There are some\nmethods that take advantage of combining filtering with wrappers. In such methods\nthe filtering is applied before performing the wrapper to alleviate the computational\ncosts of the wrapper [38].\nA group of feature selection methods is based on Bayesian networks to weight\nthe features for filtering purposes [39]. Other groups of feature selection methods\nutilize the correlation and information theory to compute the weight of the features\nand to perform the filtering task [26, 40, 41]. For instance, Sun et al. [42] proposed\nfeature selection for incomplete data by using the Lebesgue and entropy measures.\nThey claimed the method handled mixed and incomplete datasets and maintained the\noriginal classification information.\nWhile the wrappers are suitable for static data with reasonable volume, they are\nimpractical in dynamic data environments with huge data volumes. To this end, we"}, {"title": "4 The Proposed ED-Filter Method", "content": "In this paper", "phases": "a) the feature ranking phase that ranks the feature with respect to their relevance for the medical diagnosis, and (b) dimensionality reduction based on subset selection from FD in multiple iteration. In each iteration, if the subset reduction leads to improve the medical diagnosis, we update the feature set. Otherwise, we add the reduced subset to the feature set and go to the next iteration.\nFig. 1 presents the ED-Filter architecture for reducing the high-dimensional eating disorder data. The newly arrived data from Twitter is stored in the database dynamically. Due to frequent modification of the eating disorder classification data, we employ a feature selection technique that combines the wrappers with filters called ED-Filter. That is because the wrappers incur intensive computational costs and long response times, whereas the filtering methods are computationally less expensive. Thus, we combine them in ED-Filter to efficiently work on the evolving Twitter eating disorder data to extract reliable features. After the feature selection method extracts the reliable features, we remove the irrelevant features. Therefore, we utilize reliable features to generate an effective eating disorder diagnosis model for classification tasks.\nThe ED-Filter is a feature selection method designed for the high-dimensional eating disorder data of Twitter. The ED-Filter utilizes informed search and deep learning to explore the reliable feature subset with the best accuracy.\nFeature filtering techniques utilize statistical methods such as information gain [64"}]}

A classical, yet simple, approach to reasoning with inconsistency is reasoning with maximal consistent subsets [18, 9]. Given a (possibly inconsistent) knowledge base K consisting of (propositional) formulas, a maximal consistent subset K' is a set K' \u2286 K that is consistent and every set K\" with K' \u2286 K\" \u2286 K is inconsistent\n(we will give formal definitions in Section 2). We can then define a simple inconsistency-tolerant inference operator\non possibly inconsistent knowledge bases K via $K \\vdash_{mc} a$ iff K' \u22a8 a for all maximal consistent subsets K' of\nK (where \u22a8 is classical entailment). This inference operator has many good properties, in particular it coincides\nwith classical entailment in the case of consistency. However, reasoning with maximal consistent subsets is highly\nsyntax-dependent. In particular, it holds {a, \u00aca, c} \\vdash_{mc} c but {a, \u00acac} \\nvdash_{mc} c.\nIn this work, we define and analyse a new approach to reason with maximal consistency, but defined in terms of sub-\nsignatures rather than subsets of the knowledge base. More precisely, we define a maximal consistent subsignature\nas a maximal set of propositions, such that forgetting\u00b9 [13, 21] the remaining propositions from the knowledge base\nmakes it consistent again. This approach is a specific instance of the more general framework of Lang and Marquis\n[11, 12], who discuss inconsistency-tolerant reasoning under a wide variety of different strategies to forget proposi-\ntions. However, the approach we will discuss has not been analysed explicitly nor are any of our results subsumed\nby the results of Lang and Marquis. Nonetheless, by considering both the notion of maximal consistent subsignatures\nand its counterpart, the minimal inconsistent subsignatures, we obtain a technical framework that is quite similar to\nthe framework of maximal consistent subsets and minimal inconsistent subsets, but also features some additional inter-\nesting properties. We show that the classical hitting set duality [17] carries over to maximal consistent subsignatures\nas well, i. e., one can obtain maximal consistent subsignatures by removing a minimal hitting set of all minimal in-\nconsistent subsignature, and vice versa.

The proof of the following theorem and the remaining technical results from this section can be found in the\nsupplementary material.\nTheorem 2. Let \u229e \u2208 {$\u229e^{ve}$, $\u229e^{na}$}, K be a knowledge base, and S \u2286 At(K).\n1. Deciding whether S is a consistent subsignature of K wrt. \u229e is NP-complete.\n2. Deciding whether S is a minimally inconsistent subsignature wrt. \u229e is DP-complete.\n3. Deciding whether S is a maximally consistent subsignature wrt. \u229e is DP-complete.\nProof. We first consider the case of $\u229e^{ve}$. Let K be a knowledge base and S = {$a_1,...,a_n\\} \u2286 At(K). Let\n$S = At(K) \\setminus S = \\{b_1,...,b_m\\}$.\n1. Let \u03c6 \u2208 K. First, observe that computing $\u229e^{ve} S$ directly leads to an exponential blow-up in the size of \u03c6.\nMore precisely, $\u229e^{ve} S$ is of the form\n$\u229e^{ve} S= \\bigvee_{x_1,...,x_m\u2208 \\{T,\\bot\\}} [b_1 \u2192 x_1]... [b_m \u2192 x_m]$\nHowever, in order to satisfy $\u229e^{ve} S$ by an interpretation \u03c9 : $S \u2192 \\{true, false\\}$, only one of the disjuncts\nof the above form has to be satisfied. In order to do that, we require a single assignment of T, \u22a5 to the\npropositions $b_1, ..., b_m$. So, we guess (in a non-deterministic step) for each formula \u03c6 \u2208 K an interpretation\n\u03c9\u03c6 : At(K) \u2192 {true, false} such that \u03c9\u03c6(\u03b1) = \u03c9\u03c6\u2032(\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 S and \u03c6, \u03c6' \u2208 K (equivalently, each \u03c9\u03c6\nprovides an individual assignment of T, \u22a5 to the propositions in S). Then we verify (in polynomial time)\nwhether each \u03c9\u03c6 satisfies \u03c6. If this is the case, S is a consistent subsignature. This shows NP-membership.\nFor NP-hardness, we reduce the problem of checking whether a propositional formula \u03c6 is consistent to\nour problem. In fact, observe that this problem is equivalent to checking whether At(\u03c6) is a consistent\nsubsignature of {\u03c6}.\n2. For DP-membership, observe that deciding whether S is a minimally inconsistent subsignature has two sub-\ntasks:\n(a) Deciding whether S is an inconsistent subsignature and\n(b) Deciding whether each S \\ {a} is a consistent subsignature (for each a \u2208 S).\nProblem (a) is coNP-complete (follows directly from 1.). For problem (b), we can adapt the NP-membership\nproof of 1 by guessing not one \u03c9\u03c6 per formula \u03c6, but |S| different ones, one for each subsignature S \\ {a}.\nThis only requires polynomially more effort and the problem stays in NP (and the NP-hardness proof remains\nthe same since checking only one signature is a special case). So (b) is NP-complete, which shows that the\noverall problem is in DP.\nFor DP-hardness, we reduce the problem of checking whether for a pair of formulas (\u03c6, \u03c8) it is the case that\n\u03c6 is consistent and \u03c8 is inconsistent. Let a be a new proposition such that a \u2209 At(\u03c6) \u222a At(\u03c8). We claim that\n\u03c6 is consistent and \u03c8 is inconsistent iff {a} is a minimally inconsistent subsignature of\n$K_{\\varphi,\\psi} = \\{\\varphi \u2192 a, \u00ac\u03c8 \u2192 \u00aca \\}$"}, {"title": "Application to inconsistency measurement", "content": "An inconsistency measure [6, 20] is a quantitative means to assess the severity inconsistencies in knowledge bases.\nLet $R^{\u22650}_{\\infty}$ denote the set of non-negative real numbers including infinity.\nDefinition 8.

These advancements include, among others, the use of deep neural networks to represent dynamics that are partially observed by robot sensors, as well as effective control using sparse control signals. In this work, we explore a more general problem: the manipulation of acoustic waves, which are partially observed by a robot capable of influencing the waves through spatially sparse actuators. This problem holds great potential for the design of new artificial materials, ultrasonic cutting tools, energy harvesting, and other applications. We develop an efficient data-driven method for robot learning that is applicable to either focusing scattered acoustic energy in a designated region or suppressing it, depending on the desired task. The proposed method is better in terms of a solution quality and computational complexity as compared to a state-of-the-art learning based method for manipulation of dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations. Furthermore our proposed method is competitive with a classical semi-analytical method in acoustics research on the demonstrated tasks. We have made the project code publicly available, along with a web page featuring video demonstrations: https://gladisor.github.io/waves/.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Manipulation has long been a central challenge in robotics [1], [2]. Robots are frequently tasked with physically interacting with their environment, be it through picking, placing, or altering objects in a variety of applications, from industrial manufacturing [3], [4] to healthcare [5], [6]. In this work, we explore robotic manipulation on a class of vastly more complex phenomena: acoustic waves.\nManipulation of acoustic waves introduces unique challenges on several fronts. Unlike traditional object manipulation, where the robot operates in direct contact with the object, wave manipulation involves indirect influence through intermediary tools such as leveraging the interaction between the scatterers and the incident field [7]\u2013[9]. Further complicating the task, acoustic waves propagate at an extremely rapid speed [10] compared to robotic actuation. Lastly, designing an optimal controller for wave manipulation requires knowledge about the state of wave, which is a function of time and space, and usually can be only partially observed.\nEstablishing robust control of acoustic waves has wide reaching applications. Robotic systems capable of manipulating waves can lead to groundbreaking technologies, such as seismic wave mitigation [11], [12] and super-focusing devices for high-resolution ultrasound imaging and surgery [13], [14]. Mastering wave manipulation opens the door to these and many other downstream technologies.\nAside from numerical methods like finite difference [15]\u2013 [17] and discontinuous Galerkin [18], [19], which rely on computationally intensive simulations, as well as the Reduced Order Model approach [20], [21], typically suited for low-frequency wave components, there are two main approaches for wave manipulation. The first one assumes an analytical solution to the wave equation, which is a partial different equation (PDE) [22]. If such an analytical solution can be obtained, it is used in conjunction with gradient based optimization (GBO) techniques to perform optimization over a system parameters [8], [23]\u2013[25], towards a desired control objective. However, in general, an analytical solution to a PDE with arbitrary initial and boundary conditions is unknown, which leads to simplifying and limiting assumptions of the problem [8].\nAnother approach is based on machine learning and data-driven methods. The existing data-driven methods for PDE control suggest to learn wave dynamics from a large number of samples in order to predict its response to a control signal [26], [27]. Subsequently, this model can be used by a predictive controller to select optimal actions. Usually the learning of PDE dynamics is done by way of a black-box neural network model such as a (long short term memory) LSTM model [26], [27], Latent Evolution of PDE (LE-PDE)"}, {"title": "II. PRIOR WORK", "content": "There have been several attempts to apply machine learning to the manipulation of complex phenomena governed by differential equations. Overall there has been less focus on designing systems that could be realized by real robots.\nOne approach used a surrogate dynamics model to enhance reinforcement learning for PDE-governed systems [26]. The authors did not prioritize realizability in this work, assuming their agent could apply forces across the entire spatial domain of the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system\u2014a non-realistic scenario, as fluid manipulation typically involves sparse control through rotating cylinders [27] or airfoils [36]. Additionally, their reliance on full state observability, with an LSTM model trained on high-resolution simulation data, limits its applicability to real-world systems, where only sensor data is available.\nA realizable approach to using ML for fluid dynamics manipulation was demonstrated through MPC of a Navier-Stokes governed system [27]. The authors made specific choices to promote the realizability of their system, such as using sparse control through rotating cylindrical devices as well as assuming partial observability through sensors. Similar to the example of KS manipulation [26], this work also employed an LSTM architecture [27]. While the authors demonstrated the success of their method, the sample efficiency of such an architecture may not be optimal for modeling PDE dynamics. Furthermore, the dynamics of an LSTM are not interpretable and do not provide a straightforward pathway to incorporating domain knowledge from fluid dynamics.\nRecent works have explored the incorporation of physics knowledge in ML dynamics models [37], [38]. These works and others [39] have shown that incorporating such knowledge into the training of neural networks leads to better generalization and sample efficiency. In their work, the authors utilized Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [39] to model the dynamics of simple systems governed by ODE in response to control. They demonstrated that their PINN based dynamics models could effectively control a mechanical multi-link manipulator [37], the Van der Pol Oscillator [38], and the classic Four Tank System [38]. While these works demonstrated that it is possible to incorporate physics information into ML dynamics models, they are restricted to Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems which are less general than PDEs are.\nIn the following sections, we present our approach which incorporates prior knowledge of PDEs into learnt dynamics models for the purpose of manipulating acoustic waves. In our work, we prioritize realizability, with the goal of enabling wave manipulation with real robots."}, {"title": "III. PRELIMINARIES", "content": "In this section, we introduce notations and provide an overview of the problem. The formal problem definition and its solution are provided in Sections IV and V.\nWe denote $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_x}$ and $a(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_a}$ as the time coordinate, the space coordinate, and the agent\u2019s action, respectively. The partial derivative of a function w.r.t time is denoted by $d_t$. A differential operator, acting on a function $\\zeta(x, t)$ in a domain $x \\in \\Omega$, is denoted by $\\mathcal{N}(\\zeta; d(t), l(x), t)$, where $d(t)$ and $l(x)$ represent functions controllable and uncontrollable by the agent, respectively. Both $d(t)$ and"}, {"title": "IV. PROBLEM DEFINITION", "content": "In the fully observable case, we can formally define the control problem as minimization of a cost function in Eq. (4) for $t \\in [t_i, t_f]$, subject to the dynamics $\\mathcal{N}$ of $\\zeta$ and dynamics $\\mathcal{F}$ of $d$. A shorthand notation is used $\\zeta = \\zeta(x, t)$:\n\n$\\min_{a(.)} \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} ||\\mathcal{T}(\\zeta(x,t')) - \\sigma^{*}(t')||^2 dt' \n \\text{s.t.} \\begin{cases} d_t \\zeta = \\mathcal{N}(\\zeta; d(t), l(x), t), \\\\ d_t(t) = \\mathcal{F}(d(t), a(t)). \\end{cases}$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{T}(\\zeta(x, t)) = \\sigma(t)$ is a function that computes a signal we wish to predict and control, such as scattered energy, at a particular location or in the entire domain, $\\Omega$. The goal of this control problem is to select actions which influence $\\zeta$ to possess properties defined by a reference signal $\\sigma^{*}(t)$.\nThis problem is challenging, because of the coupling between ODE and PDE in the constraint in Eq. (5), and the complexity of control of an entire function, $\\zeta$. Moreover, wave propagates at a much higher speed in comparison to the responsiveness of a physically realizable robot. That creates two different time scales in the above-mentioned coupling, which requires a particular consideration.\nWe assume the robot knows the dynamics, $\\mathcal{F}$, of its scatterers which define the time-varying boundary conditions for the wave, $\\zeta$. A direct solution to this problem is intractable, so we propose to learn a low-dimensional dynamical control system of $\\zeta$, which captures the essential properties of $\\zeta$, and to utilize this low dimensional dynamics for the design of control law."}, {"title": "V. PROPOSED SOLUTION", "content": "We propose to solve the problem defined in Section IV in two stages. First, we learn a 1D dynamical control system, $z(x, t)$, which captures the essential properties of full dynamics of wave, such as energy distribution in space, scattering, excitation, and dissipation. Second, we derive optimal actions to control the energy distribution of $\\zeta$ via its 1D model $z(x,t)$, which is used as a surrogate in the optimization of Eq. (4). A shorthand notation is used $z = z(x, t)$.\nGiven an initial sensor observation, $X(t_i)$, robot state $d(t_i)$, and actions $a(t)$, the agent constructs $z$ for $t \\in [t_i, t_f]$, a 1D representation of the true function, $\\zeta$, in the reduced spatial coordinates, $\\bar{x} \\in \\Gamma \\subset \\mathbb{R}$. Construction of $z$ is accomplished by way of two encoders shown in Figure 2 which output functions defined over $\\Gamma$: the wave encoder, $\\mathcal{W}$, and the robot encoder, $\\mathcal{D}$:\n$\\mathcal{W}_\\mu: X(t) \\rightarrow [g(x,t), l(x)]$ (Wave Encoder) \n$\\mathcal{D}_\\Phi : d(t) \\rightarrow c(x, t)$ (Robot Encoder)\nwhere $c(x, t)$ and $l(x)$ represent the environment components which are controllable and uncontrollable by the agent's actions, respectively. This way $c(x,t)$ and $l(x)$ correspond to $d(t)$ and $l(x)$, respectively, in the original environment,"}, {"title": "VI. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "The goal of our experiments is to validate that the AEM approach can effectively exploit prior knowledge about the physical properties of a system governed by an acoustic PDE. We demonstrate this by first showing that the model can predict scattered energy in the domain for action sequences extending far beyond its training horizon. Next, we show that AEM can be effectively used with MPC on two benchmark tasks in acoustics: energy suppression and focusing. We compare our method to a ML approach (NODE) and a ground truth solution derived by GBO."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This work extends classical object manipulation in robotics to the domain of acoustic waves. It opens new research opportunities at the intersection of robotics and acoustics, with potential applications in such areas as ultrasound cutting, energy harvesting, and the design of new acoustic materials. This work provides proof of concept for the implementation of a physically realizable robot for wave manipulation. Importantly, the methodology is not limited to acoustics\u2014it can be adapted to other domains governed by PDEs.\nWe highlight the unique features of our approach, including sparse robotic actuation under partial observability and a fully interpretable, physics-constrained solution. This allows for a trainable PML embedded within the AEM\u2019s latent space ensuring robust and accurate long-term predictions. The proposed AEM allows to find a solution, which can be derived only in particular cases with GBO. That makes AEM a strong candidate in robot learning for PDE manipulation, where interpretable and reliable methods are required."}]}

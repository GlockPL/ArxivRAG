INTRODUCTION", "content": "The rapid advancement and deployment of Al systems across critical sectors have outpaced the development of regulatory frameworks on a global scale. Current regulatory frameworks, while well-intentioned, are fragmented, region-specific, and often unable to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technological landscape. This fragmentation creates significant challenges, particularly for global organizations operating across jurisdictions. Traditional approaches such as voluntary compliance and geographically constrained regulations struggle to ensure consistent enforcement, leaving vulnerabilities in security, privacy, and ethical standards.\nIn response to these challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized Al governance framework that leverages blockchain technology to establish a unified approach. Blockchain's inherent properties, including immutability, transparency, and distributed consensus, uniquely position it to address the complexities of cross-border Al governance. By harnessing blockchain's inherent features, the proposed framework aims to create a secure and ethical environment for Al deployment on a global scale. Traditional governance methods often rely on central authorities or jurisdiction-specific protocols, making them slow to adapt. In contrast, blockchain's decentralized architecture allows for a unified and trustworthy framework that transcends borders, ensuring real-time compliance and continuous auditing of Al systems.\nThe framework is designed with practical applications in mind, ensuring that it can be implemented effectively across various industries. Additionally, this paper outlines a strategic deployment timeline and addresses key challenges by offering evidence-based solutions, providing a comprehensive roadmap for achieving global AI governance."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Current AI Governance Landscape", "content": "The global Al governance landscape is a patchwork of varying regulations.

PROPOSED DECENTRALIZED AI GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK", "content": "The proposed Decentralized Al Governance Framework leverages blockchain technology and a risk-based classification system to create a decentralized, transparent, and adaptable governance structure for AI in the industry.\nThis framework ensures that Al systems are governed according to their risk levels, addressing the complexities of global financial regulation by integrating key components that provide security, compliance, and trust across international markets."}, {"title": "A. Global Consensus Mechanism", "content": "This paper proposes a tailored Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism designed specifically for the financial sector's unique requirements [6]. This mechanism brings together diverse stakeholders, including major banks, fintech companies, regulatory bodies, and industry experts, to collaboratively establish and update governance standards. These standards are dynamically adjusted based on the classification of Al systems according to their risk levels. This multi-stakeholder approach ensures that governance decisions are informed by a broad spectrum of perspectives, facilitating a more holistic and adaptable governance structure."}, {"title": "1) Implementation:", "content": "The implementation involves active participation from regulators, financial institutions, and AI developers. Given the sector's high stakes, the DPoS mechanism integrates multiple layers of security and accountability:\nStakeholder Engagement and Voting Power: Stakeholders elect delegates to make governance decisions, with voting power typically proportional to token holdings [7]. To prevent centralization, adjustments such as weighted voting for regulatory bodies and limits on single-entity influence will ensure fair representation for smaller entities.\nBalanced Decision-Making: To ensure a balanced governance structure, the system will implement consensus thresholds and voting caps. These thresholds ensure that decisions require broad support, preventing a small group of delegates from making unilateral decisions. Additionally, an anti-collusion mechanism will be introduced, where the network monitors for patterns of behavior that suggest coordinated voting, triggering additional scrutiny or audits.\nSecurity Measures: To address DPoS vulnerabilities, the framework integrates multi-signature requirements for critical actions, with approvals needed from multiple delegates. Independent third-party audits will assess governance integrity, reviewing voting power distribution and detecting any anomalies.\nAdaptive Governance Mechanism: The DPoS system will include adaptive governance features that allow the framework to evolve in response to new risks or changes in the regulatory landscape. For example, the system can dynamically adjust the weight of votes or the criteria for delegate selection based on real-time data, such as the emergence of new financial risks or changes in Al-related regulations."}, {"title": "2) Financial Sector Example:", "content": "In practice, this DPoS mechanism enables collaboration between banks, fintechs, and regulators to classify Al systems by risk.

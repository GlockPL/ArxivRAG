This paper proposes a formal framework based on symbolic compression, integrating combinatory logic, information-theoretic optimal encoding, and context-aware inference techniques to achieve a step-change improvement in token efficiency while preserving semantic integrity. We establish a mathematical framework within a functional programming paradigm, derive the quantitative relationship between symbolic density and model interpretability, and propose a differentiable compression factor metric to evaluate encoding efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language. Experimental results show that this method achieves a 78.3% token compression rate in code generation tasks while improving logical traceability by 62% through structural explicitness.

Kolmogorov complexity measures the shortest program length required to describe a string, reflecting the inherent complexity of the string. Based on this theory, we construct the symbolic density measure:\n$\\rho=\\frac{K(s)}{S}$ (1)\nwhere s is the program string, $K(\\cdot)$ represents Kolmogorov complexity, and s is the string length. When $\\rho \\rightarrow 1$, the symbolic system achieves optimal encoding in information theory, meaning that the maximum amount of information content is preserved with the minimum number of tokens.\nIn addition, this paper combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to optimize the model within a limited parameter space, enabling the low-cost application of the GAEL language to LLMs, thereby further reducing token costs and improving the overall efficiency of the model."}, {"title": "1.3 Method Innovation", "content": "The main contributions of this paper include:\n1.

This optimization objective aims to find the optimal balance between symbol length and semantic fidelity. To solve this optimization problem, we adopted a differential dynamic programming method, gradually optimizing the symbolic representation S to achieve optimal symbolic density.\nOptimizing symbol density not only reduces the number of tokens but also improves the model's inference speed and interpretability. By adjusting the compression weight $\\lambda$, the compression ratio can be flexibly adjusted in different application scenarios to meet specific needs."}, {"title": "2.2 Combinatory Logic Encoding", "content": "To achieve efficient symbolic compression, we employed a recursive SKI combinator encoding scheme. The specific encoding rules are as follows:\nencode(e) =\n$\\begin{cases}\nK & \\text{if e is a constant} \\\\\nS & \\text{if e is a function application} \\\\\nI & \\text{if e is an identity function}\n\\end{cases}$ (3)\nwhere K, S, and I represent the constant, selection, and identity combinators in the SKI combinator calculus, respectively. This encoding scheme can compress the complex structure of the syntax tree into a shorter sequence of symbols, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens. Theoretically, the compression rate of this encoding scheme can reach O(logn/n),\nwhere n is the number of nodes in the abstract syntax tree (AST).\nBy recursively applying SKI combinators, we can decompose complex syntactic structures into basic combinators, thereby achieving efficient symbol compression. At the same time, this method preserves the semantic information of the code, ensuring that the compressed code is semantically consistent with the original code."}, {"title": "2.3 Context-Aware Inference", "content": "To further improve encoding efficiency, we introduced a context-aware inference mechanism. Specifically, we established a stochastic process model for type inference:\nP(T/C) = $\\frac{exp(-E(\\tau, C))}{\\Sigma_{\\tau'\\in\\Gamma} exp(-E(\\tau', C'))}$ (4)\nwhere C is the context environment, \u0393 is the type space, and the energy function E is defined as the degree of violation of type constraints. Through this model, the system can infer the most likely type based on the context environment, thereby reducing unnecessary token generation during the encoding process.\nThe design of the energy function E is based on the Hammersley-Clifford theorem, constructing a Markov random field model for type constraints. This model can effectively capture the dependencies between types and dynamically adjust the encoding strategy during inference to achieve optimal token compression effects."}, {"title": "2.4 Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and GAEL Language Application", "content": "To achieve a low-cost application of the GAEL language in LLMs, we introduced parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques.

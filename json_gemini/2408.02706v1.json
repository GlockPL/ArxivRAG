In order to produce explainable and uncertainty-aware predictions, this study presents a novel framework called Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (BKANs), which combines the expressive capacity of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Bayesian inference. We employ BKANs on two medical datasets, which are widely used benchmarks for assessing machine learning models in medical diagnostics: the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. Our method provides useful insights into prediction confidence and decision boundaries and outperforms traditional deep learning models in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, BKANs' capacity to represent aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty guarantees doctors receive more solid and trustworthy decision support. Our Bayesian strategy improves the interpretability of the model and considerably minimises overfitting, which is important for tiny and imbalanced medical datasets, according to experimental results.

Introduction", "content": "The area of machine learning has made great strides in recent years, especially with regard to deep learning models, which perform remarkably well in a variety of applications, from natural language processing to image recognition [1]. However, these models often operate as black boxes that are difficult to understand and interpret [2], which makes them unsuitable for use in delicate industries like finance [3] and healthcare [4]. Moreover, uncertainty in predictions is not naturally taken into account by the deterministic structure of conventional deep learning models [5], which is important for making well-informed decisions in practical situations. To address these limitations, there has been a growing interest in integrating Bayesian techniques with deep learning, which also offers a framework for modelling uncertainty and improves the interpretability of neural networks [6]. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) [7], provide a structured method for designing neural networks that effectively approximates multivariate functions by combining univariate functions [8]. This architectural breakthrough has demonstrated potential to increase neural network accuracy and convergence [9], especially for applications involving intricate mathematical operations and scientific computing [10]. Nevertheless, KANs lack a framework to explain their decision-making processes or to quantify the uncertainty in their predictions, just like other neural network architectures [11][12]. In order to model uncertainty and enhance interpretability, this research presents Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Bayesian-KANs), a unique version of conventional KANs that integrates Bayesian inference techniques [5]. Bayesian-KANs can reflect uncertainty through probability distributions across network parameters by substituting probabilistic splines for deterministic spline functions [13]. This allows the network to provide insights into the confidence of predictions and promotes more robust decision-making [6]. The utilisation of a probabilistic method not only improves the expressiveness and adaptability of KANs, but it also corresponds with the increasing demand for AI models that can be explained [14][15]. Construction of neural networks that can dynamically adapt to changing data complexities and provide a quantitative level of confidence in their outputs is made possible by the incorporation of Bayesian methods into the KAN framework [13]. These kinds of abilities are especially useful in scientific and engineering applications, where precise uncertainty modelling can have a big impact on how trustworthy and reliable computer models are [2]. We conducted a thorough investigation of Bayesian-KANs in this work, assessing their effectiveness in a variety of tasks such as classification and disease prediction. Our tests show that Bayesian-KANs perform better than baseline models and conventional KANs, providing stronger uncertainty quantification, improved interpretability, and superior accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating probabilistic reasoning into Bayesian-KANs, we highlight their potential to enhance the area of neural networks and offer theoretical insights into its mathematical foundations. Through their ability to bridge the gap between probabilistic modelling and deterministic KANs, Bayesian-KANs mark a major advancement in the creation of transparent, dependable, and powerful neural networks. This work adds to the larger endeavour of developing machine learning models that are reliable and usefully incorporated into critical decision-making processes. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: An overview of Bayesian neural networks and the design of Bayesian-KANs is given in Section 2. While the actual results and comparative"}, {"title": "2. Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks", "content": "2.1 Overview of Bayesian Neural Networks Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network that uses Bayesian inference to generate probabilistic interpretations of model predictions [16]. Traditional neural networks produce deterministic predictions based on fixed parameters, whereas BNNs consider network weights and biases as probability distributions. This probabilistic technique allows for the quantification of uncertainty in forecasts, resulting in more informed decision-making in cases where uncertainty is crucial [17]. BNNs use prior distributions over model parameters, which are then updated with observed data to generate posterior distributions [18]. This Bayesian approach provides a natural method for model regularisation and robustness since it automatically protects against overfitting by integrating over parameter uncertainty. The predictive distribution in BNNs is calculated by marginalising over the parameter space, which entails integrating the likelihood function and prior distribution [19]. This technique produces a distribution that accounts for both epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in model parameters due to inadequate data) and aleatoric uncertainty (data variability). 2.2 Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold Networks Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [20], which states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable plus addition. KANs use this principle to build neural networks that divide complicated multivariate functions into simpler univariate functions, allowing for efficient and interpretable approximations [7]. Figure 1 depicts the hierarchical design of KANs, in which input features are first modified by univariate functions before being combined through further layers to approach the desired function. This design takes advantage of the intrinsic structure of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem to improve the model's approximation capabilities while retaining interpretability. KANs have proven successful in a variety of applications, particularly scientific computation and function approximation tasks, thanks to their capacity to quickly capture complicated relationships in data. 2.3 Integrating Bayesian Inference into KANS Integrating Bayesian inference [5] into KANs yields Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Bayesian-KANs), a unique architecture that blends KAN interpretability with BNN uncertainty modeling capabilities [6]. This integration requires many significant adjustments to the standard KAN architecture: 1- Probabilistic Spline Functions: Bayesian-KANs use probabilistic splines instead of deterministic spline functions, as in classic KANs. Figure 2 depicts splines that are parameterised by distributions rather than fixed values, allowing for the depiction of uncertainty in the transformation of input features. This probabilistic approach to splines allows Bayesian-KANs to absorb variability in the input space and produce more nuanced approximations of complex functions. 2- Bayesian Hierarchical Structure: Bayesian-KANs preserve the hierarchical structure of KANs, with each layer using Bayesian inference to update the parameter distributions based on observed data, see Figure 3. This hierarchical Bayesian technique propagates uncertainty across the network, yielding a full probabilistic model that accounts for both local and global uncertainties in the approximation process."}, {"title": "2.4 Architectural Design of Bayesian-KANs", "content": "Bayesian-KANs' architectural design is made up of numerous unique components, all of which contribute to the model's overall performance and interpretability: \u2022 Input Layer with Probabilistic Transformations: Bayesian-KANs' input layer transforms input information using probabilistic splines.

Mathematical Formulation", "content": "This section presents a complete mathematical formulation of Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Bayesian-KANs). This formulation combines Bayesian inference with Kolmogorov-Arnold decomposition, resulting in a strong framework for modelling complicated functions with quantifiable uncertainty. We begin by defining the Bayesian-KAN architecture's probabilistic base and then go into detail on the mathematical procedures that govern its behaviour. 3.1 Bayesian Foundations The Bayesian-KAN architecture utilizes Bayesian inference [5] to represent model parameters as probability distributions. This method simplifies the depiction of uncertainty and enables adaptive learning from data. Let $X = {X_1, X_2, ..., x_n}$ represent the input data, and $Y = {Y_1, Y_2, \u2026, Y_n}$ represent the corresponding output labels. The objective is to infer the posterior distribution of the model parameters O based on observed data (X, Y). 3.1.1 Prior and Posterior Distributions We define a prior distribution $P(\\Theta)$ over the parameters to capture our initial view about their potential values. The likelihood function $P(Y | \\Chi, \\Theta)$ represents the probability of the data given"}, {"title": null, "content": "the parameters [18]. The posterior distribution, which reflects the revised beliefs after witnessing the data, is derived using Bayes' theorem:\n$P(\\Theta| \\Chi, Y) = \\frac{P(Y | \\Chi, \\Theta) P(\\Theta)}{P(Y|\\Chi)}$\nThe evidence term $P(Y|X)$ acts as a normalization constant and is calculated by marginalizing over all conceivable parameter values [21]:\n$P(YX) = \\int P(Y | \\Chi, \\Theta) P(0) d0$\n3.2 Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation According to he Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [12], any multivariate continuous function $f(X)$ can be decomposed into a sum of univariate continuous functions. The representation of a function $f$: Rn $\\longrightarrow$ IR, is as follows:\n$F(X) = \\sum_{q=1}^{2n+1} \\Phi_q (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\Psi_{qi} (x_i))$\nWhere:\n\u2022 $\\Phi_q$ and $\\Psi_{qi}$ are continuous univariate functions.\n\u2022 $x_i$ denotes the input variables. Bayesian-KANs augment this representation by introducing probabilistic features, yielding in a more adaptable and interpretable design.\n3.3 Bayesian-KAN Architecture The Bayesian-KAN architecture is intended to capture complicated data dependencies using a hierarchical probabilistic framework. We describe the architecture's essential components and mathematical formulations.\n3.3.1 Input Layer The input layer performs probabilistic transformations to the input features X. Each feature $x_i$ corresponds to a probability distribution $N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2_i)$, where $\u03bc_i$ and $\\sigma^2_i$ denote the mean and variance, respectively. This probabilistic representation reflects the uncertainty in the input data [6]. The input features are transformed as follows:\n$Z_i = \\Psi_i(x_i) = \\mu_i + \\sigma_i. \\epsilon_i$"}, {"title": null, "content": "Where $\u2208_i$~$N(0, 1)$ represents a standard normal random variable.\n3.3.2 Intermediate Layers The intermediate layers are made up of Bayesian units that represent interactions among the transformed features. Each unit computes a weighted sum of the input features, followed by a non-linear activation function. The weights and biases in these layers are represented as distributions rather than fixed values, allowing the model to better capture uncertainty [13]. A Bayesian unit produces the following output:\n$h_i = \\Phi_j (\\sum_{i=1}^{m} W_{ij}z_i + b_j)$\nWhere:\n\u2022 $W_{ij}$~$N (\\mu_{wij} ,\\sigma^2_{wij})$ represents the weights.\n\u2022 $b_j$~$N (\\mu_{b_j}, \\sigma^2_{b_j})$ is the bias term.\n\u2022 $\\Phi_j$ represents a non-linear activation function, such as ReLU or sigmoid.\n3.3.3 Output Layer The output layer generates probabilistic predictions by integrating the outputs of the intermediate layers. The final prediction is a distribution indicating the model's confidence in its estimate. The predictive distribution is expressed as:\n$\\hat{y} = P(y | X, 0) = \\int P_{out} (\\sum_{j=1}^{k} W_ih_j + b_{out}) P(0)d0$\nWhere:\n\u2022 $w_i$~$N (\\mu_{w_j}, \\sigma_{w_j})$ represents the output layer weights.\n\u2022 $b_{out}$~$N (\\mu_{bout} ,\\sigma^2_{bout})$ is the output layer bias.\n\u2022 $P_{out}$ represents the activation function of the output layer.\n3.4 Training and Inference Bayesian-KANs are trained by optimizing the parameter distributions in order to maximize the posterior distribution. Variational inference techniques are used to approximate the intractable integrals involved in the Bayesian framework. 3.4.1 Variational Inference"}, {"title": null, "content": "Variational inference aims to approximates the true posterior distribution $P(\\Theta| X, Y)$ with a simpler distribution $Q(\\Theta)$. The goal is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two distributions [2]:\n$KL(Q(0) || P(\\Theta| X, Y)) = \\int Q(0) log \\frac{Q(0)}{P(\\Theta| X, Y)} do$\nThis optimization problem equates to maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO):\n$ELBO = E_{Q(0)} [log P(Y |\\Chi, \\Theta)] \u2013 KL(Q(0) || P(0))$\n3.4.2 Monte Carlo Estimation Monte Carlo sampling algorithms are used to estimate the predicted values and gradients needed for training. We use the variational distribution $Q(0)$ to obtain stochastic estimates of the ELBO and its gradients, allowing for efficient optimization. 3.5 Uncertainty Quantification One significant advantage of Bayesian-KANs is their capacity to quantify uncertainty in predictions. This capability is provided by the posterior predictive distribution, which integrates over the parameter space to generate a distribution of probable outcomes [6]. 3.5.1 Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty The Bayesian-KANs distinguish between two sorts of uncertainty [18]: \u2022 Epistemic Uncertainty: This is caused by uncertainty in model parameters as a result of inadequate data. It can be lowered by obtaining more data and is modeled using the posterior distribution. \u2022 Aleatoric Uncertainty: Represents the intrinsic variability in the data that cannot be by lessened by collecting more data. It is captured by simulating the noise in the data. The overall uncertainty in predictions is a combination of these two sorts:\nTotal Uncertainty = Epistemic Uncertainty + Aleatoric Uncertainty\n3.5.2 Uncertainty Propagation The Bayesian-KAN design propagates uncertainty by marginalising model parameter distributions.

Future research might include investigating more efficient inference methods, such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics or variational inference techniques, to balance accuracy and processing cost. Scalability becomes increasingly important as datasets and models expand in size and complexity.

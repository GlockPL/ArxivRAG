In order to produce explainable and uncertainty-aware predictions, this study presents a novel framework called Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (BKANs), which combines the expressive capacity of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Bayesian inference. We employ BKANs on two medical datasets, which are widely used benchmarks for assessing machine learning models in medical diagnostics: the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. Our method provides useful insights into prediction confidence and decision boundaries and outperforms traditional deep learning models in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, BKANs' capacity to represent aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty guarantees doctors receive more solid and trustworthy decision support. Our Bayesian strategy improves the interpretability of the model and considerably minimises overfitting, which is important for tiny and imbalanced medical datasets, according to experimental results. We present possible expansions to further use BKANs in more complicated multimodal datasets and address the significance of these discoveries for future research in building reliable AI systems for healthcare.

Introduction", "content": "The area of machine learning has made great strides in recent years, especially with regard to deep learning models, which perform remarkably well in a variety of applications, from natural language processing to image recognition [1]. However, these models often operate as black boxes that are difficult to understand and interpret [2], which makes them unsuitable for use in delicate industries like finance [3] and healthcare [4]. Moreover, uncertainty in predictions is not naturally taken into account by the deterministic structure of conventional deep learning models [5], which is important for making well-informed decisions in practical situations. To address these limitations, there has been a growing interest in integrating Bayesian techniques with deep learning, which also offers a framework for modelling uncertainty and improves the interpretability of neural networks [6].\nInspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) [7], provide a structured method for designing neural networks that effectively approximates multivariate functions by combining univariate functions [8]. This architectural breakthrough has demonstrated potential to increase neural network accuracy and convergence [9], especially for applications involving intricate mathematical operations and scientific computing [10]. Nevertheless, KANs lack a framework to explain their decision-making processes or to quantify the uncertainty in their predictions, just like other neural network architectures [11][12].\nIn order to model uncertainty and enhance interpretability, this research presents Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Bayesian-KANs), a unique version of conventional KANs that integrates Bayesian inference techniques [5]. Bayesian-KANs can reflect uncertainty through probability distributions across network parameters by substituting probabilistic splines for deterministic spline functions [13]. This allows the network to provide insights into the confidence of predictions and promotes more robust decision-making [6]. The utilisation of a probabilistic method not only improves the expressiveness and adaptability of KANs, but it also corresponds with the increasing demand for AI models that can be explained [14][15].\nConstruction of neural networks that can dynamically adapt to changing data complexities and provide a quantitative level of confidence in their outputs is made possible by the incorporation of Bayesian methods into the KAN framework [13]. These kinds of abilities are especially useful in scientific and engineering applications, where precise uncertainty modelling can have a big impact on how trustworthy and reliable computer models are [2].\nWe conducted a thorough investigation of Bayesian-KANs in this work, assessing their effectiveness in a variety of tasks such as classification and disease prediction. Our tests show that Bayesian-KANs perform better than baseline models and conventional KANs, providing stronger uncertainty quantification, improved interpretability, and superior accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating probabilistic reasoning into Bayesian-KANs, we highlight their potential to enhance the area of neural networks and offer theoretical insights into its mathematical foundations.\nThrough their ability to bridge the gap between probabilistic modelling and deterministic KANs, Bayesian-KANs mark a major advancement in the creation of transparent, dependable, and powerful neural networks. This work adds to the larger endeavour of developing machine learning models that are reliable and usefully incorporated into critical decision-making processes.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: An overview of Bayesian neural networks and the design of Bayesian-KANs is given in Section 2.

Bayesian Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks", "content": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network that uses Bayesian inference to generate probabilistic interpretations of model predictions [16]. Traditional neural networks produce deterministic predictions based on fixed parameters, whereas BNNs consider network weights and biases as probability distributions. This probabilistic technique allows for the quantification of uncertainty in forecasts, resulting in more informed decision-making in cases where uncertainty is crucial [17].\nBNNs use prior distributions over model parameters, which are then updated with observed data to generate posterior distributions [18]. This Bayesian approach provides a natural method for model regularisation and robustness since it automatically protects against overfitting by integrating over parameter uncertainty. The predictive distribution in BNNs is calculated by marginalising over the parameter space, which entails integrating the likelihood function and prior distribution [19]. This technique produces a distribution that accounts for both epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty in model parameters due to inadequate data) and aleatoric uncertainty (data variability)."}, {"title": "2.2 Kolmogorov\u2013Arnold Networks", "content": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [20], which states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable plus addition.

Figure 2 depicts splines that are parameterised by distributions rather than fixed values, allowing for the depiction of uncertainty in the transformation of input features. This probabilistic approach to splines allows Bayesian-KANs to absorb variability in the input space and produce more nuanced approximations of complex functions.\n2- Bayesian Hierarchical Structure:\nBayesian-KANs preserve the hierarchical structure of KANs, with each layer using Bayesian inference to update the parameter distributions based on observed data, see Figure 3.

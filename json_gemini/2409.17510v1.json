Laurienti", "Guorong Wu"], "abstract": "Although modern imaging technologies allow us to study connectivity between two distinct brain regions in-vivo, an in-depth understanding of how anatomical structure supports brain function and how spontaneous functional fluctuations emerge remarkable cognition is still elusive. Meanwhile, tremendous efforts have been made in the realm of machine learning to establish the nonlinear mapping between neuroimaging data and phenotypic traits. However, the absence of neuroscience insight in the current approaches poses significant challenges in understanding cognitive behavior from transient neural activities. To address this challenge, we put the spotlight on the coupling mechanism of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) by formulating such network neuroscience question into an expressive graph representation learning problem for high-order topology. Specifically, we introduce the concept of topological detour to characterize how a ubiquitous instance of FC (direct link) is supported by neural pathways (detour) physically wired by SC, which forms a cyclic loop interacted by brain structure and function. In the clich\u00e9 of machine learning, the multi-hop detour pathway underlying SC-FC coupling allows us to devise a novel multi-head self-attention mechanism within Transformer to capture multi-modal feature representation from paired graphs of SC and FC. Taken together, we propose a biological-inspired deep model, coined as NeuroPath, to find putative connectomic feature representations from the unprecedented amount of neuroimages, which can be plugged into various downstream applications such as task recognition and disease diagnosis. We have evaluated NeuroPath on large-scale public datasets including Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank (UKB) under different experiment settings of supervised and zero-shot learning, where the state-of-the-art performance by our NeuroPath indicates great potential in network neuroscience.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The seek of meaningful feature representations for graph topology has been extensively investigated [44, 28, 34], with widespread applications in reasoning path [16] and cycle basis [61] for knowledge graph, as well as neural fingerprint [17], junction tree autoencoder [29] and cellular Weisfeiler Leman (WL) testing [7] for molecular substructure encoding. Moreover, graph data in the realm of neuroscience research demands feature representation bearing additional neuroscience insight which is supposed to underline particular neurobiological mechanisms of interest. For example, substructure embedding [36, 31] and snapshot embedding [53, 3] have been proposed to characterize the phenotypic traits from structural connectivity (SC), which is a static graph and physically wired by neuronal fibers, and functional connectivity (FC) in the brain, which is a dynamic graph and supported by neural circuit overlaid on SC topology [2]. Nevertheless, the graph learning approach of physical neural pathways of SC coupled with FC is rare in related works [4, 13, 39].\nThe advancement of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technology enables the in-vivo measurement of physical region-to-region connections through neuronal fibers (aka. SC). Multiple lines of neuroscience finding suggest that high-level cognition and behavior emerge from the remarkable SC-FC coupling mechanism, making the in-depth understanding of the interplay between SC and FC become the gateway to reverse engineering human mind [52, 5]. To that end, a plethora of computational models have been proposed over the past decade, including biophysical models [25, 58], graph harmonics [46, 38], network communications [19], multivariate statistical technique [41], and deep learning-based structure-function mapping [10, 49, 45]. However, the complex relationship between structural and functional connectivity is still elusive [14], particularly evidenced by the lack of direct physical pathways (formed by SC in Fig. 1 orange box) between two brain regions that exhibit functional co-activation (indicated by FC in Fig. 1 green box) [24, 42, 6]. Although the topology of SC does not necessarily always aligned with the counterpart of FC motivating previous related works, there is a converging consensus that each FC instance is supported by a sub-graph of SC, as shown in Fig. 1 orange box, where blue links constructing a path sub-graph represent the neural pathway that physically supports the red link.\nWe strike on this outstanding neuroscience question by lifting the concept of univariate coupling, which is limited to the correspondence between a direct link of SC and another direct link of FC, to a new paradigm of multivariate SC-FC coupling mechanism that models how the ubiquitous FC instance is associated with the detour pathway on SC topology. As shown in green box of Fig. 1, the red line represents the direct FC link between region #1 and #2 while the collection of blue lines indicates the corresponding detour pathway of SC. Although the whole-brain topology remains unchanged as brain function evolves, the functional co-activation over time is dynamically supported by different neural pathways of SC. Note, the direct FC link and SC detour form a cyclic loop inherited from both SC and FC topology. Such conceptualization is supported by various neuroscience findings that synchronization of neural activity between two brain regions is fundamentally supported by the underlying neural circuitry established by structural connectivities [23, 24, 21].\nIn the perspective of machine learning, as shown in the middle of Fig. 1, the overarching goal is to establish a mapping function between neuroimaging data (SC only, FC only, or both) to the phenotypic traits (such as cognitive tasks). Due to the complex nature of human cognition, however, current deep models encounter several significant challenges. First, it is less common to use the static SC only for the prediction of evolving cognitive states, largely due to the ill-posed setting which boils down to a one-to-many mapping [50]. Alternatively, tremendous efforts have been made to predict cognitive states based on time series of neural activity [3] and FC topology [4]. However, it has been frequently reported that massive inter-subject variations of FC often predominate the intrinsic task-relevant patterns, such variations in real-world data are demonstrated in Sec. 2.1. Thus, current learning-based approaches have difficulties in scaling up to large-size population data. Furthermore, limiting consideration to either SC or FC alone fails to capture the holistic nature of the brain as a dynamic system, resulting in existing approaches having limited power to uncover new insight of complex relationship between SC and FC [39]. In this regard, it is natural to combine the information of SC and FC in a multi-modality learning scenario [51, 30, 57]. In general, current research focuses on information fusion at node or link level. Few attention has been paid to integrating SC and FC by combining the power of machine learning and insight of cognitive neuroscience.\nTaken together, we propose a novel deep model, coined NeuroPath, to (1) enhance the machine performance of predicting cognitive status using both SC and FC information and (2) uncover new"}, {"title": "Preliminaries", "content": "Massive inter-subject variations of FC often predominate the intrinsic task-relevant patterns.

The most representative work includes graph convolutional network (GCN [33, 36]) and transformer-based deep models [3, 31]. Recently, most of popular GNN models and their application in neuroscience have been reviewed in [4].\nInspired by the great success of Transform [56] in NLP and CV, various graph transformer models have been proposed in graph learning. For example, GraphGPS [47] and TokenGT [32] models use either a structure encoding or token of graph elements as the initial graph feature representations. Furthermore, a self-attention gating mechanism is proposed in [26] using an additional branch of edge embedding to implement the augmentation of self-attention. By integrating original node features and structural embeddings into an augmented self-attention module, Graphormer [62] shows the same expressibility as conventional graph neural networks (GNN), which has been proved in [63] that such augmented self-attention is strictly more expressive than low-order WL for distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs [43]. In the following, we present our NeuroPath where the novel biological-inspired self-attention mechanism yields more expressive power of graph representation than Graphormer [62]."}, {"title": "NeuroPath \u2013 A Biological-Inspired Transformer for Human Connectomes", "content": "Problem formulation Given that the detour degree can profile nodes highly associated with functional sub-networks, the problem in this work is formulated as how to plant this neuroscience insight of topological detour from SC-FC coupling into deep neural networks.\nNotations.

In practice, SC and FC are calculated by the subject-wise normalized water matter (WM) fiber counts and the Pearson's correlation coefficient of neural signals, respectively. Furthermore, we use $\\hat{A}(\\cdot)$ to denote the binary adjacency matrix after high-pass filtering and adding self-loop for either SC or FC.

RQ1: How is performance on neural activity recognition and cognition disordering disease diagnosis compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) brain models and graph transformers? RQ2: Can the brain network representation by NeuroPath being consistent on zero-shot learning experiments? RQ3: Does performance enhancement by NeuroPath align with intuitions by ablations of model framework and neural pathway length? RQ4: What is the pattern of neural pathways contributing to prediction? To thoroughly answer those questions, four public datasets are used in our experiments. Detailed data preprocessing and profiles can be found in Appendix.\nThe Lifespan Human Connectome Project Aging (HCPA) dataset [9] is instrumental in task recognition research, offering a comprehensive view of the aging process. It includes data from 717 subjects, encompassing both fMRI (n=4,863) and DWI (n=716). It includes data from three brain tasks associated with memory and sensory-motor: VISMOTOR, CARIT, and FACENAME, and the resting state. In the related experiments, these tasks are treated as (1) a four-class classification problem and (2) resting/tasking classification for zero-shot learning. We partition brain regions using AAL atlas [55] in experiments except for ablation studies using Gordon atlas [20].\nUnited Kingdoms Biobank (UKB) dataset is a large-scale dataset with MRI data. There are fMRI (n=5,483) and DWI (n=3,162) preprocessed by the same algorithm as HCPA. It includes data from one brain task that engages cognitive and sensory-motor [22, 37]. Data is treated as a two-class classification in the following experiments. Brain regions are partitioned by Gordon atlas [20].\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset [59] serves as an invaluable resource, featuring a collection of pre-processed fMRI (n=138) and DWI (n=135) with AAL parcellation in our experiment. Additionally, ADNI includes clinical diagnostic labels, encompassing a spectrum of cognitive states: Cognitive Normal (CN), Subjective Memory Complaints (SMC), Early-Stage Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Late-Stage Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Considering the data balance issue, we simplified these categories into two broad groups based on disease severity: we combined CN, SMC, and EMCI into \u2018CN' group, while LMCI and AD were grouped as the 'AD' group.\nOpen Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset [35] presents a substantial collection of data from 924 subjects, comprising 3,322 fMRI sessions in total. Among the dataset, fMRI (n=402) and DWI (n=362) are pre-processed with Destrieux parcellation [15]. Our experiment focused on binary classification: subjects in preclinical stages of AD or those manifesting dementia-related conditions are under the 'AD' group, while healthy individuals are under the 'CN' group.\nAll datasets are split as train/validation in a 5-fold cross-validation according to the subject index to prevent data leakage. Node attributes of brain network setting as Blood-Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal or correlation (CORR) between BOLD signals are performing vary on different datasets [48]. Furthermore, the deep model performance is also affected by using a short-length or full-length BOLD which is considered a dynamic or static brain network, respectively [48]. To evaluate NeuroPath under all situations, four combinations of CORR/BOLD and static/dynamic are all tested in our experiments."}, {"title": "Performance of Neural Activity Classification", "content": "Performance on datasets HCPA and UKB is listed in Table 1.

It is worth noting that NeuroPath is the only one that has over 90% accuracy in these experiments. Class unbalance in ADNI and OASIS datasets makes the F1 score lower than accuracy. Nevertheless, NeuroPath has top scores on both two datasets, 83.29% and 87.02%, respectively, under all data settings. Given the challenges of more neural pathways present in dynamic graphs that have a higher degree as listed in Appendix, our performance slightly drops to against others. In summary, NeuroPath shows superior performance than existing SOTA models on static graphs of various data with the benefit of our novel multivariate SC-FC coupling."}, {"title": "Zero-shot Learning", "content": "Despite neural activity classification and cognitive disordering diagnosis are two types of experiments usually tested in computational neuroscience research, zero-shot learning by training and validating the model on one dataset and testing on another dataset is rarely present in the field. Since for both resting/tasking and AD/CN classification, we all have two datasets, it is feasible to test our explainable deep model by zero-shot learning to show the clinical value. The experimental setting is consistent as above with a 5-fold cross-validation to choose the best model state on the train-val dataset, and then test it on validating a set of the corresponding fold of another dataset.\nGiven that the three SOTA brain models are all sensitive to the node number of the graph, they are not compatible with zero-shot learning. Therefore, F1 scores are listed in Table 3 in comparison against two general graph transformers, which are designed for various vertex-cardinality. It is worth highlighting that our model outperforms all competitors under different data settings except for ADNI OASIS dynamic. Specifically, NeuroPath can surpass the best of others with a 16.8 score for HCPA UKB static. Although the performance of zero-shot learning by NeuroPath still has an observable gap to the fully supervised version listed in Table 1 and 2, results here show that the neural pathway pattern learned by NeuroPath is more consistent than FC pattern across datasets."}, {"title": "Ablation Studies", "content": "Since the length of the neural pathway is limited by the head number of two branches in NeuroPath, the ablation of the head number in MHSA leads to various performances of our model. As shown in Fig. 4, we set head number H from 1 to 8 keeping all other settings remain the same. The green curves shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate clear peaks at H = 7 on datasets HCPA and UKB that are processed with a finer parcellation of 333 regions. In comparison, for the atlas used on datasets ADNI and OASIS has no more than 200 regions, the peak disappeared with a flat trend of F1 score suggesting longer pathways are less contributing to the prediction under fewer regions. This is aligned with the nature of more hops needed to construct the same neural pathway where regions are more but smaller on HCPA and UKB than ADNI and OASIS.\nTwin branch is a core design of NeuroPath to plant the insight of SC-FC coupling to deep model. The ablation of using none or a single branch can illustrate the effectiveness of our design. As listed in Table 4, NeuroPath with twin branch has the best performance on all datasets except for the F1 score on OASIS. Despite TD-MHSA using the detour adjacency that can detect brain communities as mentioned in Sec. 2.1, SC-FC fused feature representation by using the consistency constraint LTD for twin branch has more contribution to the performance."}, {"title": "Pattern of Neural Pathway Contributing to Prediction", "content": "As we introduced in Sec. 3.2, NeuroPath is in fact weighting neural pathways to obtain the feature representation of the brain network. Therefore, the neural pathways can be sorted by their weights produced by our model. As shown in Fig. 5, we visualized three pathways corresponding to the same three functionally connected node pairs (blue nodes in Fig. 5), where links that have the same color are members of the same pathway. To show the neural pathway pattern of diseased brain topology, the three functionally connected node pairs are selected from FC links that exhibit significant difference (p < 0.05) between AD and CN subjects from the OASIS dataset in a t-test. We exclude the influence of inter-subject variations of FC mentioned in Sec. 2.1 by narrowing FC links in the t-test solely between regions of the subcortical, entorhinal cortex, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe, where those brain structures are associated with the progression of AD [60, 11]. In comparison of pathway visualization in Fig. 5, it is obvious that the AD subject demands a longer SC detour to support the same direct FC link than CN subjects which only need shorter pathways (within two hops). This observation suggests a diseased human connectome might need a longer detour to support normal brain function since the brain network could rewire neurological fibers from other normal regions to fetch up lesion regions [8, 1]. Therefore, this visualization is neuroscience evidence of the interpretability of NeuroPath."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we propose NeuroPath, a graph transformer to model the physical neural pathway by our novel multivariate SC-FC coupling mechanism and learn the relationship between neural pathways and brain functions.

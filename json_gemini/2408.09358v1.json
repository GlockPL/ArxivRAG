The emergence of CBCT systems with panoramic and\ncephalometric scanning capability and the design of panoramic systems with auto-focusing functionality are the\naftereffects of such innovations and research endeavors. Despite the wide range of imaging methods available [1],\nextraoral methods like CBCTs and panoramic X-rays [2] have seen a sharp increase in demand because they are more\nconvenient for patients to use during imaging. Panoramic X-rays, known as orthopantomograms (OPGs), have long\nbeen a staple in dental imaging due to their ability to capture a full view of the entire maxillofacial region in a single\nimage with low radiation exposure to patients [3]. In contrast, CBCTs can offer sharp, detailed, three-dimensional views\nof the head, but at the expense of increased radiation exposure [4, 5, 6]. CBCT has demonstrated its efficacy across\ndiverse applications, encompassing disease prognosis and bone density analysis [7, 8]. The extraction of mandibular\nshape [9, 10] and estimation of dental arches [11, 12] represent pivotal stages in the analysis and visualization of CBCT\ndata. The efficacy and quality of CBCT are intrinsically linked to the scanner parameters and the acquisition and\nprojection geometries [13, 14]. Conversely, panoramic X-rays are frequently afflicted by challenges such as ghostly\nshadows, distortions, and the superimposition of bony and dental structures. Additionally, inaccuracies can arise due to\npatient misalignment, resulting in disproportionate teeth and jaw. Moreover, errors in measurements and assessments\nmay emanate from image distortions induced by the acquisition geometry, potentially leading to misinterpretations in\ndiagnostic outcomes [15]. Scholars have systematically examined and contrasted the accuracy of panoramic radiographs\nand CBCT concerning applications tailored to specific tasks [16, 17, 18, 19].\n\nThe examining physician determines the imaging modality based on the diagnostic task and the patient's condition.\nWhile most tasks can resort to panoramic X-rays with comparable precision, they are not a suitable substitute for\nCBCT in some situations, such as abnormal tooth visualization, surgical planning, and implant treatment [20, 21]. To\navoid unnecessary scanning, dentists prefer to use CBCTs as their primary imaging technique rather than panoramic\nX-rays. However, subsequent phases of the diagnostic process may necessitate the utilization of two-dimensional\nX-ray imaging. Due to the augmented radiation exposure, subjecting patients to additional scans promptly following\nCBCT is impractical. Furthermore, preparing uncooperative pediatric and adult patients for subsequent scans poses\nconsiderable challenges. In such scenarios, the preferable course of action would involve the synthesis of a panoramic\nX-ray utilizing the existing CBCT data. While this approach may not serve as a substitute for the authentic X-ray, it\nserves the purpose of delaying the necessity for additional scans. This delay is especially beneficial to mitigate the\npotential adverse effects of repeated radiation exposure on the patient's well-being. Post-processing and visualization\nmethods using CBCT, such as Curved Multi-Planar Reformatting (CMPR) and Direct Volume Rendering (DVR),\nfacilitate the generation of panoramic views by jaw reformatting. Besides the CBCT reconstruction software, third-party\napplications are also available that can offer functionalities to manually outline a focal plane or dental arch from an\nappropriate axial slice, enabling the creation of panoramic views[22, 23]. However, selecting the optimal axial slice that\ncomprehensively covers each tooth, irrespective of its angulation, demands substantial effort and time. Additionally,\naccurately identifying critical craniofacial landmarks essential for depicting jaw shape requires the expertise of a skilled\nprofessional.\nAutomated techniques for panoramic synthesis from CBCT primarily delineated a suitable dental arch resembling\nthe jaw shape using appropriate curve fitting algorithms [24, 25, 26, 27]. Depending on the chosen reconstruction\nmethodologies, the reformatted X-ray images can minimize interference from the ghost effect and unwanted anatomical\nstructures. Tohnak et al. introduced an algorithm for reconstructing synthetic X-ray images from CT data, requiring\nusers to mask the maximum intensity projection of CT data in the axial plane or manually delineate a 3D region\nof interest around the teeth that appear in the final X-ray projection. Yun et al. proposed a panorama synthesis\nalgorithm that involves jaw detection through thresholding axial slices encompassing the teeth and fitting polynomial\ncurves to approximate a dental arch. Alternatively, Amorim et al. utilized Bezier curve fitting to represent the jaw\nshape. Nonetheless, selecting an optimal curve for defining an ideal dental arch resembling the jaw shape remains an\nissue. The task becomes intricate when attempting to extract a proper dental arch in the presence of significant metal\nimplants. Given that most approaches prioritize the selection of axial slices with visible teeth, the same methodology\nproves ineffective for patients without teeth. While manual delineation of the arch is considered a gold standard, it\nnecessitates expert intervention. Accurately estimating the focal plane that encompasses the entire teeth region without\ncompromising the linear and angular measurements [28] of the teeth is another challenge. If the patient's jaws fall\noutside the focal plane, the image's quality and measurements may degrade[29], impacting the overall utility of the\nimage. Additionally, some patients may exhibit teeth with incorrect axial inclinations, particularly at the incisors,\nresulting in unclear visibility in the panoramic image.\nContemporary panoramic systems integrate movable rotation centers, tracing an elliptical path during jaw scanning\n[30, 31]. These rotation patterns, tailored by manufacturers, can be adjusted based on the patient's jaw morphology.\nHowever, standard trajectories may not consistently yield optimal results due to variations in patient positioning\nduring CBCT acquisition and diverse jaw shapes. So, researchers have also been focusing on replicating panoramic\nimaging rotational principles using CBCT. Park et al. [32] heuristically defined a quadratic curve for the dynamic\nrotation trajectory, however, this fixed trajectory path applies universally, disregarding individual patient jaw shapes\nand positions. Moreover, the angular shift between the adjacent rays defined as per their approach causes the majority\nof rays to be centered near the molars. Alternatively, Kwon et al. [33] introduced a technique for panoramic image\nreconstruction by isolating panoramic projection data from dental CBCT projection data. However, the effectiveness\nof this approach is contingent upon having access to both the CBCT and panorama acquisition parameters. These\nparameters are essential for accurately extracting the projections from CBCT, ensuring a comprehensive panoramic\nview without information loss.\nTo address these constraints, our paper introduces an innovative approach to panorama tomosynthesis. Our method\ninvolves the definition of a simulated projection geometry that integrates moving rotation centers following a semi-\nelliptical trajectory. Unlike traditional methods that rely on patient-specific dental arch delineation, our proposed\ntechnique aims to identify an optimal focal trough encompassing the entire jaw region, ensuring its inclusion in the\nfinal 2D projection. Additionally, our algorithm incorporates a tilt correction in the sagittal plane to mitigate unequal\nmagnification of left and right jaws resulting from improper patient positioning. Notably, our method demonstrates\nefficacy even in scenarios involving extensive metal implants or patients with missing or non-existent teeth. Our\nstudy is pioneering in harnessing an extensive array of datasets to evaluate the efficacy of tasks related to this domain\ncomprehensively.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the data collection and a comprehen-\nsive overview of the steps undertaken in our proposed approach. Our experimental findings and analysis are reported in\nsection 3. Subsequently, sections 4 and 5 provide in-depth discussions and conclusions, respectively."}, {"title": "2 Materials and Methods", "content": "The proposed methodology is outlined in Fig. 1. It consists of four major tasks: Initially, the jaw position is detected and\nany misalignment stemming from the patient's head tilt relative to the sagittal reference plane is corrected. Subsequently,\na focal trough is defined, encompassing both the maxilla and mandible, thereby ensuring that only tissues within this\ndelineated region contribute to the resultant Panoramic projection. This measure effectively mitigates the occurrence\nof unwanted anatomical structures and ghost images in the X-ray output. Following this, a trajectory is determined\nto replicate the movement of the source-detector system and X-ray directions. Multiple X-ray projections are then\ngenerated along this trajectory, covering a 90-degree angular sweep using pencil-beam geometry. The summation of\nthese generated projections yields the final Panoramic X-ray image."}, {"title": "2.1 Jaw Detection and Tilt-Correction", "content": "A patient's head CBCT encompasses a diverse array of tissues, including air, soft tissues, bone, and enamel, among\nothers. The grayscale values depicted in CBCT scans are not direct representations of Hounsfield Units (HU) but are\noften linearly scaled values, contributed by various factors such as X-ray tube parameters, cone-beam geometry, detector\ncharacteristics, scattering, and other artifacts [34, 35]. To enhance contrast and facilitate tissue differentiation, We\nhave applied rescaling and windowing techniques to the CBCT data according to the manufacturer-defined parameters.\nGiven the predominant composition of bone and enamel within the jaw structure, extraneous tissues are eliminated by\nadjusting the window level to encompass values surpassing those of soft tissue.\nThe Coronal Maximum Intensity Projection(MIP) is obtained from the windowed CBCT data to determine the Region\nof Interest (ROI) composed of teeth and jaw. ROI is determined in such a way that it encompasses both the mandible\nand maxilla. Subsequently, an axial MIP is taken using a subset of slices belonging to this ROI region, providing\na preliminary approximation of the jaw shape. However, the presence of metallic implants can disrupt this process,\nnecessitating further refinement of the jaw mask through morphological operations like opening, closing, and hole-filling.\nFinally, a contour detection algorithm is used to extract the jaw shape.\nPotential errors in patient positioning caused by the tilt from the sagittal reference planes can be identified and corrected\nwith the help of contour detection plots. Correcting misalignments is imperative, as incorrect jaw alignment can\nintroduce asymmetries in the magnification of the jaw structure, which could potentially obscure diagnostic accuracy."}, {"title": "2.2 Focal Trough Estimation", "content": "There is no standard shape that defines the shape of a human's jaw. Jaw size can be small, medium, or large, and jaw\nshape can be V-shaped, standard, or U-shaped for diverse individuals based on their age, race, and gender. Manufacturers\ntypically offer a selection of horseshoe-shaped focal troughs for patient imaging, each tailored to accommodate varying\njaw sizes and shapes. Notably, these focal troughs exhibit thickness variations, being thicker near the molars and thinner\nnear the incisors.\nHowever, in our approach, we have implemented elliptical focal troughs to encompass the entire mandible and maxilla.\nThese troughs are strategically designed with thicker regions near the incisors and thinner regions near the molars. This\nadjustment addresses potential challenges, such as anterior displacement of the maxillary anterior region [36], which\nmay obscure the visibility of the maxillary incisors in X-ray images and lead to distortion or misinterpretation of the\nimage. By confining the X-ray projection to the regions enclosed within the focal troughs, we ensure that unwanted\nanatomical structures and ghost images are minimized in the resulting X-ray outputs. This approach enhances diagnostic\nclarity and accuracy by reducing the potential for image artifacts and superimposition of irrelevant structures."}, {"title": "2.3 Panoramic Scan Simulation", "content": "Unlike CBCT machines, Panoramic systems utilize a dynamic rotation center for the movement of the source-detector\nunit. This movement defines the focal layer within the patient's jaw. However, like the dental arches a standard trajectory\ndoesn't exist and varies depending on the manufacturers. To address this variability and simulate projection geometries\ntailored to the patient's jaw size, we have developed an elliptical trajectory model, as expressed in (1).\n$\\frac{(x \u2212 h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1$ (1)\nwhere, parameters h, k, a, and b are determined based on the dimensions of the jaw region identified using contour\nplots. In our method, b is half the height and a is half the width of the contour plot. This approach allows for the\nformulation of trajectories that adapt to the specific anatomical characteristics of the patient's jaw. A representative\ntrajectory formulated using this methodology is illustrated in Figure. 1C.\nOnce the trajectory is established, the next step involves tracing rays along this trajectory. These rays are defined as\ntangents to the elliptical trajectory with predefined slopes. The equation of a line is given by (2).\ny = mx + c (2)\nwhere m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept.\nBy combining (1) and (2), the slope of the tangent line (m) can be determined, as shown in Eqn. (3).\nm=\\frac{-b^2(x-h)}{a^2(y - k)}$ (3)\nTo ensure comprehensive sampling of rays throughout the jaw, we adopt a 180-degree total angular sweep and the\nshift between adjacent rays changing between 0.4 and 0.8. Consequently, the number of sampled rays decreases as the\ntangents move anteriorly. This approach guarantees uniform ray distribution throughout the jaw, thereby enhancing the\naccuracy and reliability of panoramic imaging.\nFollowing the extraction of rays, we sample points along these rays, with these points constrained to the predefined focal\ntrough. Subsequently, these sampled points are aggregated into single pixels using Beer Lambert's equation, facilitating\nthe synthesis of X-ray images. This methodology allows for the accurate representation of anatomical structures within\nthe focal trough, thereby contributing to the diagnostic utility of panoramic radiography."}, {"title": "2.4 X-ray Synthesis", "content": "According to Beer Lambert's absorption-only attenuation law, the resultant intensity I of a pencil beam passing through\na material of thickness t and density \u03c1, with linear attenuation coefficient \u03bc and mass attenuation coefficient $\\frac{\u03bc}{\u03c1}$, can\nbe defined as follows:\n$I = I_o exp [-\u03c1t] = I_o exp[-\\frac{\u03bc}{\u03c1}t]$. (4)\nFor a ray of length l, this equation can be expressed in integral form as in Eqn.(5).\n$I = I_o exp [-\\int_{0}^{l} \u03bc(t)dt]$ (5)\nBy discretizing it into N sampling points along the ray, Eqn. (5) can be reformulated into Eqn. (6).\n$I \u2248 I_o exp [-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \u03bc_i\u03b4_i ]$ (6)\nWe assume that attenuation is independent of the ray direction. Considering the linear relationship between \u03bc, HU, and\nCBCT gray values, the transmittance of the ray through the CBCT volume [32] can be expressed as:\nT = exp [-\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \u03b2\u03c3_i\u03b4_i ]$, (7)\nwhere, \u03b2 is the correction factor heuristically determined from experiments and \u03c3i is the pixel intensity and \u03b4i is the\nunit distance in CBCT domain.\nFurthermore, in our process, we have utilized CBCT windowing to suppress tissues below the soft tissue window when\nrendering the rays. This technique aids in enhancing the visibility of incisors, which might otherwise be obscured due\nto the area between the tongue and teeth. Ultimately, the rendered value at the pixel location corresponds to (1 \u2013 T)."}, {"title": "2.5 Dataset", "content": "The clinical dental head CBCT scans of 600 patients (400 Females, 200 Males; Mean age:50, Deviation: 26) gathered\nfrom the Chosun School of Dentistry in Gwangju, South Korea, were used in the study.

Notably, the algorithm\nexhibited resilience even with complex factors such as heavy metal implants or missing teeth, reaffirming its suitability\nfor real-world clinical settings. A pivotal aspect of our approach lies in the meticulous preprocessing steps employed to\nenhance the quality of input data. Leveraging the CBCT windowing techniques, we successfully standardized gray-level\nvariations across the dataset, optimizing tissue differentiation and ensuring consistent image quality.\nFigure 3 showcases the qualitative outcomes obtained from the synthesis of panoramic X-rays using our proposed\nmethodology. We have considered two baseline models for comparison. The first baseline model, as described in [27],\nemploys a method of synthesizing panoramic X-rays by delineating a dental arch and subsequently flattening the CBCT\nvolume along this extracted arch. Conversely, the second baseline model [32], adopted a similar approach to ours by\nusing principles of rotational panoramic radiography.\nThe limitations of the CBCT flattening approach are apparent from the distorted representation of incisors observed in\nthe resulting X-rays. Such distortions stem from the challenges associated with selecting an appropriate dental arch and\ndetermining the depth of the flattened slices. Additionally, the anterior tilt of maxillary incisors further exacerbates\nthis issue, often resulting in blurred or entirely invisible incisors in the final X-ray images. In contrast, the approach\nproposed by Park et al. [32] introduces inconsistencies in ray sampling near the incisors due to a sudden increase in\nthe sampling rate of rays in this region. Consequently, smaller incisors may appear merged in the final X-ray images,\ncompromising their clarity and distinctiveness. However, our approach circumvents these imperfections through the\nimplementation of patient-specific rotation trajectories and a consistent increase in shift angles between the extracted\nrays. This ensures a more uniform and accurate representation of anatomical structures, particularly near the incisors.\nTo quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on a random set of 10\npatients."}, {"title": "4 Discussions", "content": "The utilization of maximum intensity projections (MIP) holds significant importance in the identification of the ROI\ncontaining the teeth and jaw.

The quality of such X-rays is significantly influenced\nby a multitude of factors including imaging protocols, equipment settings, and patient positioning. Consequently,\nimages captured by distinct panoramic systems inherently exhibit unique characteristics, precluding exact replication.\nEvaluation of X-ray quality encompasses critical considerations such as the clarity and visibility of anatomical structures,\nmagnification rate, and the curvature of the smile line.\nFor optimal diagnostic utility, the occlusal plane should manifest as either straight or slightly curved upwards [37],\nalbeit variations may arise owing to tooth alignment and patient positioning nuances. Furthermore, diagnostic clarity\nnecessitates the discernible presence of dental fixtures such as braces, prosthetic crowns, restorations/fillings, implants,\nroot canals, and temporomandibular canals. Notably, the identification of inferior alveolar nerves traversing the\nmandibular canal serves as a valuable indicator for distinguishing radio-opaque and radiolucent regions, thereby\nfacilitating the detection of potential tumors and cysts in this anatomical area. Our synthesized images successfully\ncaptured these intricate details following the reconstruction process.\nPanoramic X-rays offer a valuable means of detecting significant bone destruction and loss, which is crucial for assessing\nthe adequacy of bone support required to maintain tooth stability. The integrity of the bone support, extending to the\ntooth crown, is paramount for ensuring sufficient support for the tooth structure. However, bone resorption can occur\ndue to various patient-related conditions and local factors, leading to a reduction in bone volume and support. Panoramic\nX-rays serve as a diagnostic tool for quantifying both vertical and horizontal bone losses, aiding in the assessment of\noverall bone health and the extent of periodontal disease. Our synthesized X-rays demonstrate\nthe capability to visualize bone loss with a fidelity comparable to that of conventional X-rays. This underscores the\nsignificance of our synthesized X-rays as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying and assessing bone loss, thereby\nfacilitating comprehensive evaluation and management of periodontal conditions and related dental pathologies.\nA notable drawback associated with panoramic X-rays lies in the occurrence of ghost structures and the superimposition\nof images from the opposite jaw and cervical spine, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. However, our\nproposed methodology addresses this limitation by incorporating jaw detection and focal trough estimation techniques,\nthereby ensuring that only structures within the predefined region of interest are projected onto the final image.

For an ideal Panoramic X-ray, the focal trough should conform precisely to the shape of the patient's jaw. It\nshould be sufficiently generous enough to encompass the entirety of the teeth and jaw, both anteriorly and posteriorly,\nto ensure comprehensive visibility of incisors and molars. Hence, the width of the focal trough shouldn't remain\nuniform across all axial slices, and each axial focal plane needs to be anteriorly or posteriorly displaced to encompass\nthe necessary structures. This dynamic adjustment is crucial to ensure the X-ray maintains the requisite sharpness\nand dimensional accuracy for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning. As noted by Scarfe et al. [38, 39],\noptimal beam projection angles are pivotal in minimizing the overlap between teeth, particularly in regions prone to\ninter-proximal overlap, such as the premolars. Hence, contrary to earlier suggestions, the optimal projection angle for\nthe rays should not be 90 degrees to the dental arch. Achieving precise alignment with the diverse inter-proximal contact\npoints is challenging due to dental deformities in the patient. The individual's gender, age, and race also influence this.\nHence, our choice of shape for the rotation trajectory cannot adequately handle this requirement due to patient diversity.\nWhile our paper has effectively tackled the issue of patient positioning errors resulting from the tilt from the sagittal\nreference plane, we have yet to address similar concerns regarding the axial and coronal reference planes. Identifying\nsuitable landmarks to ascertain the tilt from these reference planes necessitates expert intervention, potentially requiring\nmanual adjustment. So, further research and development are warranted to address similar challenges concerning the\nother two planes. Additionally, the presence of scattering from metal implants and other artifacts originating from\nCBCT reconstruction can significantly compromise the quality of synthesized X-rays.

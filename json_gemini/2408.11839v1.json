INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the training of deep neural networks, the weight distribution of each layer is an important parameter of the network. Adaptive optimizers, in conjunction with the backpropagation algorithm, guide the update of network weight parameters and enhance network performance, which is an essential part of network training. Adaptive methods converge quickly in the early stages of training, but their generalization performance on the test set is weaker than that of non-adaptive methods, and they suffer from sawtooth-like oscillation problems in the iteration trajectory. Many scholars have proposed various Adam[1] variants based on the aforementioned issues, but most Adam family optimization algorithms ignore the role of short-term gradient information in parameter optimization. diffGrad [2] and AngularGrad [3] propose to adjust the learning rate using short-term gradient information, but both have only verified the effectiveness of their methods in image classification tasks. In addition, the complex angle calculation in the AngularGrad algorithm makes it require more time and computational resources in model training.\nBased on the above issues, in order to further optimize the optimization performance of adaptive optimizer algorithms, this paper deeply explores the role of short-term gradient information in parameter updates. The main contributions and innovations are as follows:\n(1) This paper specifically implements the adaptive friction coefficient S based on the Sigmoid [4] function and the Tanh [5] function. On the basis of Adam, the adaptive friction coefficient S is introduced, thus proposing two new optimizer algorithms, sigSignGrad and tanhSignGrad. The paper theoretically analyzes the adjustment effect of the friction coefficient S on parameter updates in different regions of the loss function.\n(2) This paper verifies the possibility of inserting the proposed friction coefficient S as a plug-in into existing optimizers, attempts to insert the friction coefficient S implemented based on the Sigmoid function into AdamW [6] and AdamP [7], thus proposing two new optimization algorithms, sigSignAdamW and sigSignAdamP, providing a scheme for improving the optimization performance of existing optimizers.\n(3) This paper verifies the excellent performance of sigSignGrad and tanhSignGrad through a large number of experiments."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "In recent years, adaptive optimizers have become integral to the training of deep neural networks, addressing issues related to generalization and oscillation. This section reviews the significant contributions and methodologies relevant to the development and enhancement of these optimizers. In the medical domain, deep learning models have seen significant advancements. Xu et al. emphasized the importance of data preprocessing in improving the performance of deep learning models for medical diagnostics [8]. Similarly, Xiao et al. applied conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) to enhance surgical imaging by effectively defogging images, demonstrating the versatility and potential of deep learning techniques in medical imaging [9].\nThe integration of attention mechanisms in deep learning models has also shown considerable promise. Xiao et al. explored the enhancement of deep learning models through attention mechanisms for mining medical textual data, highlighting the importance of efficient data handling and feature extraction [10]. Zhu et al. introduced the Attention-Unet model, which combines attention mechanisms with U-Net architectures to achieve fast and accurate segmentation in medical imaging, thereby improving model performance and training efficiency [11]. Furthermore, the use of adaptive optimizers in neural networks for survival prediction across diverse cancer types has been a significant area of research. Yan et al. employed neural networks to predict patient survival, illustrating the potential of deep learning models to provide valuable insights in medical prognostics [12]. These studies underscore the broad applicability of deep learning methodologies across various applications, aligning with our research focus on enhancing optimizer performance.

SigSignGrad", "content": "on analyzing the adjustment effect of the adaptive friction coefficient S on parameter updates based on sigSignGrad.\nThe Sigmoid function maps the input parameter to a range between (0,1). The expression for the friction coefficient $S_t$ based on the Sigmoid function is shown in Equation.\n$S_t = Sigmoid(\\beta_3 g_{t-1} * g_t)$\nFrom Figure 1, it can be observed that when the signs of the two gradients are the same, the friction coefficient S falls within the range (0.5,1). Conversely, when the signs of the two gradients are opposite, the friction coefficient S is within the range (0,0.5), which aligns with the target parameter update strategy. The friction coefficient DFC of diffGrad and the friction coefficient \u03be of AngularGrad both lie within the range (0.5,1). Compared to diffGrad and AngularGrad, the friction coefficient S based on the Sigmoid function can adjust the parameter update with a broader range of steps, enabling the optimizer to converge more rapidly.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the black dashed arrows represent the direction of the gradient, where a and b denote two consecutive gradients updated by Adam, with a being the gradient of the most recent iteration and b being the current gradient. b' represents the parameter gradient b after incorporating the friction coefficient S. To simplify the description, we assume that the gradient consists of only two directional components, namely the x-axis and y-axis directions. The friction coefficient S can reduce the update step size of the gradient b in the y-axis direction while increasing the update step size of the gradient b in the x-axis direction. Consequently, the angle between two consecutive gradients changes from the black At to the gray A't, making the optimization trajectory smoother.\nIn the case of the area (c) in Figure 3, after incorporating the friction coefficient S, the angle $A_t$ becomes flatter, and the parameter update from $\\theta_8$ to $\\theta_9$ will be closer to the local minimum $x^*$.\nIn summary, the friction coefficient S contributes to smoothing the optimization trajectory, accelerating convergence, and enhancing the optimizer's ability to converge to the minimum value."}, {"title": "B. TanhSignGrad", "content": "We have also considered the feasibility of implementing an adaptive friction coefficient S using the Tanh function, and by introducing this adaptive friction coefficient S based on the Tanh function into Adam, we obtain a new optimizer, which we refer to as tanhSignGrad.\nThe Tanh function is a common activation function that maps the input parameter to a range between (-1,1). The expression for the friction coefficient $S_t$ based on the Tanh function is shown in Equation .\n$S_t = \\frac{Tanh(\\beta_3 g_{t-1} * g_t) + 1.0}{2}$\nConsequently, the range of the friction coefficient S is (0,2). When the sign of the current iteration gradient is the same as that of the most recent iteration gradient, the parameters are updated with a larger step size (where S is within the range (1,2)); when the signs of the two gradients are opposite, the parameters are updated with a smaller step size (where S is within the range (0,1)). Similarly, compared to diffGrad and AngularGrad, the adaptive friction coefficient S of tanhSignGrad has a broader range to adjust the learning rate, which is more aligned with the goal of updating parameters with a larger step size to accelerate convergence under appropriate conditions, rather than simply updating with a smaller learning rate than before.\nThe adjustment effect of the adaptive friction coefficient S on parameter updates based on the Tanh function is similar to that of the friction coefficient S based on the Sigmoid function."}, {"title": "IV.

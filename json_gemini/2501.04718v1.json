INTRODUCTION", "content": "INGLE-CELL RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged\nas a landmark advance in transcriptional analysis [1], [2],\n[3], affording a high-resolution, cell-specific perspective on\ntissues, organs, and entire organisms [4], [5]. This capability en-\nables a wide range of applications, from spatial transcriptomic\nanalysis [6], exploration of tissue-level architecture [7], [8],\nidentification of salient cell subpopulations [9], to the develop-\nment of large-scale domain foundation models [10], [11], [12],\n[13]. However, scRNA-seq data present substantial analytical\nchallenges, including lack of label, high dimensionality, sparsity,\nand noise, often culminating in the well-known 'curse of\ndimensionality' [14], [15]. These issues complicate downstream\ntasks such as biomarker discovery and cell-type classification,\nmaking robust, scalable solutions an urgent necessity.\nExisting approaches to manage scRNA-seq complexity\ngenerally fall into three categories: (1) Dimensional Reduction\nTechniques, such as PCA [16], t-SNE [17], and UMAP [18]\nare essential for managing the complexity of scRNA-seq\ndata, especially for visualization. However, these methods\nalso have several drawbacks: These methods can result in the\nloss of subtle yet biologically significant information, distort\nthe true structure of the data, and are highly dependent on\nthe choice of parameters, such as the number of principal\ncomponents or the perplexity value in t-SNE. (2) Statistical\nMethods, including the use of p-values, fold changes [19], or\nanalysis of highly variable genes (HVG) [20], [21], [22], are\nfundamental steps in identifying significant characteristics in\nscRNA-seq data analysis [23], or domain foundation model\nresearch [10], [24]. However, these methods often assume data\nnormality and independence assumptions that may not hold\nin scRNA-seq contexts and are sensitive to the inherent noise\nand sparsity of the data, potentially leading to inaccuracies by\neither masking biological signals or amplifying artifacts. (3)\nGene Selection Approaches, specifically tailored for genomics\nresearch, including scRNA-seq studies. Those approaches,\nwhether highly depend on well-trained embedded machine\nlearning models [25] to identify the importance of each gene\nor they utilize heuristic metrics to determine biomarker [26],\n[27], are always unstable and not optimization-directed.\nTo tackle these previously discussed issues, we take a\nmoment to reassess and examine the expert-driven solution [28].\nThe upper portion of Figure 1 illustrates the current manual"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARY", "content": "Common Tasks in Single-Cell Data Analysis. In the context\nof scRNA-seq analysis, Clustering is often a preliminary\ndownstream task, and gene selection plays a pivotal role in\nmaking this process effective. By grouping cells based on their\nexpression profiles, clustering enables the discovery of putative\ncell types, states, or patterns in an unsupervised manner, thus\nrevealing novel insights into cellular diversity. Beyond cluster-\ning, Visualization techniques are equally central to interpret\nsingle-cell data. Dimensional reduction methods (such as t-SNE,\nUMAP, or PCA) project the high-dimensional gene expression\nmatrix into two or three dimensions, enabling researchers\nto observe distinct cell groups and evaluate how well their\nchosen gene set resolves meaningful biological structures.\nHeatmap Analysis further augments clustering and visualization\nby highlighting gene expression patterns across cell subsets in\na more interpretable, matrix-like depiction. Through a heatmap,\none can assess how the chosen genes distribute their expression\nlevels across cell clusters, either verifying known biological\nsignatures or uncovering unexpected relationships. Differential\nExpression Analysis is a crucial follow-up to clustering. It\nseeks to identify specific genes that are significantly up- or\ndownregulated between identified cell clusters, conditions (e.g.,\ntreatment vs. control), or developmental stages. In summary,\nbecause the clustering task is more suitable for quantitative\nevaluation, this study adopts clustering-based metrics as the\nprincipal quantitative evaluation tools for model performance.\nCurrently, to comprehensively assess the applicability of the\nmodel in real-world biological contexts, we leverage additional\ntasks, such as visualization, heatmap analysis, and differential\nexpression analysis, to conduct qualitative evaluations.\nGene Selection Problem. Formally, the given scRNA-seq\ndataset can be denoted as D = {G, X}, where G denoted the\noverall gene set and X is the expression matrix. We can use\nX[G'] = {xi,j}j\u2208G' to denote select gene expression matrix\nwith a gene subset G', where xi,j \u2208 X represents cell-i's\nexpression of the genes-j. We aim to develop a generalized\nyet robust gene panel selection method that can identify the\noptimal key gene panel G* from a scRNA-seq dataset D,\noptimally preserving biology signal for various downstream\nanalysis tasks:\nG* = argmax E(C(X[G'])), \\qquad (1)\nG'\\subset G\nwhere E and C denoted the evaluation metric and downstream\nanalysis method, respectively."}, {"title": "III.

EXPERIMENT SETTING", "content": "A. Dataset Description\nOur research involved 24 public single-cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNA-seq) datasets derived from various sequencing tech-\nnologies and representing diverse biological conditions. These\ndatasets were collected from several public databases [38],\n[39], [40], including the National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress,\nand the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), etc. The \"Cao\"\ndataset [41] was procured from a study utilizing the sci-\nRNA-seq method (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA\nsequencing). The \"Han\u201d dataset [42] originates from the Mouse\nCell Atlas. To test the model robustness, we include one dataset\nwith batch effect, Human Pancreas [43]. Detailed specifics,\nincluding each dataset's origins, description, and size of cells\nand genes, are provided in the Supplementary Material.\nB. Evaluation Metrics.\nTo compare the performance of these methods, we evaluate\nthe cell-type-discriminating performance of genes via cell\nclustering. We follow the same setting as CellBRF [25]\nby adopting a graph-based Louvain community detection\nalgorithm in Seurat [44] as the downstream cell clustering\nanalysis method, a commonly used software toolkit for scRNA-\nseq clustering. We adopted three widely used metrics to\nquantitatively assess model performance, including normalized\nmutual information (NMI) [45], adjusted rand index (ARI) [46],\nand silhouette index (SI) [47]. All metrics range from 0 to 1,\nwhere the higher the value, the better the model performance.\nC. Baseline Methods.\nOur comparative analysis evaluated RIGPS against seven\nwidely used baselines. The detailed descriptions are listed as\nfollows: (1) CellRanger [48] converts scRNAseq data into\na gene-barcode matrix suitable for gene selection through\nsample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell\ngene counting; (2) Pearson Residuals (PR) [49] normalizes\nand identifies biologically variable genes by quantifying the\ndeviation of observed gene expression counts from an expected\nmodel of constant expression across cells; (3) Seurat v3 [21]\nperforms gene selection by applying a variance-stabilizing\ntransformation to account for the mean-variance relationship\ninherent in scRNAseq data, then identifying the top genes with\nthe highest variance after standardization; (4) HRG [27] utilizes\na graph-based approach to identify genes that exhibit regional\nexpression patterns within a cell-cell similarity network; (5)\ngeneBasis [26] aims to select a small, targeted panel of genes"}, {"title": "V.

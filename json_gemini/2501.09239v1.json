{"title": "AI-BASED IDENTITY FRAUD DETECTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW", "authors": ["Chuo Jun Zhang", "Asif Q. Gill", "Bo Liu", "Memoona Anwar"], "abstract": "With the rapid development of digital services, a large volume of personally identifiable information (PII) is stored online and is subject to cyberattacks such as Identity fraud. Most recently, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled deep fake technologies has significantly increased the complexity of identity fraud. Fraudsters may use these technologies to create highly sophisticated counterfeit personal identification documents, photos and videos. These advancements in the identity fraud landscape pose challenges for identity fraud detection and society at large. There is a pressing need to review and understand identity fraud detection methods, their limitations and potential solutions. This research aims to address this important need by using the well-known systematic literature review method. This paper reviewed a selected set of 43 papers across 4 major academic literature databases. In particular, the review results highlight the two types of identity fraud prevention and detection methods, in-depth and open challenges. The results were also consolidated into a taxonomy of AI-based identity fraud detection and prevention methods including key insights and trends. Overall, this paper provides a foundational knowledge base to researchers and practitioners for further research and development in this important area of digital identity fraud.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Identity is used to identify an individual or entity [66-68]. Identity fraud is a criminal act involving the use of another person's identity or the creation of a fake identity for fraudulent purposes [69-70]. Fraudsters' main goal or motive could be to obtain money and public resources, evade obligation or commit other crimes [44]. With the rapid development of digital and online services, a large amount of personally identifiable information (PII) is scattered and generally"}, {"title": "Research background and motivation", "content": "Identity, which serves to identify an individual and entity, is widely used daily to access various activities such as public services, education, medication, job applications, financial transactions, social media, etc. [66]. The threats to identity are known as identity theft and identity fraud, which are collectively referred to as identity-related crimes, including all forms of illicit conduct involving identity, such as acquiring, manipulating, producing, transferring, possessing, or using identity information for unlawful activities [44], [69]. Identity theft and identity fraud, though related, are not identical. Initially, the two concepts were not clearly distinguished until 2011 when The United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice provided a clear definition of them [69],[71].\nIdentity theft is often the first step of identity fraud, which primarily involves the unlawful acquisition of identity information, such as PII [78]. As shown in Fig 1., identity thieves initiate malicious attacks, including malware, phishing, and brute force, to intrude into various institutions such as financial institutions, hospitals, governments, and enterprises to steal identity information [56\u201364]. These stolen identities are either directly sold or transferred to accomplices, such as identity forgers, who produce synthetic or fabricated identities for resale to criminal individuals or groups [78-79]. With the assistance of AI technologies, particularly GAI, the manipulation and creation of both real and synthetic identities have become significantly easier [80]. Identity fraudsters then use this identity information to create new identities or take over other identities to gain either financial or non-financial benefits at the cost of other accounts [44]. For example, defraud financial institutions to receive payouts or services [81]. This identity information can also be used to facilitate a means to an end as part of other illegal acts such as human trafficking, money laundering, and illegal immigration [82]. Beyond financial losses, the consequences of identity fraud extend, encompassing psychological distress, reputation damage, and potential legal repercussions for victims [72-77].\nThe current defence against identity fraud primarily relies on two processes: authentication and continuous authen-\ntication. Authentication is the process of verifying whether someone or something is truly who or what it claims\nto be. Authentication methods are categorised into three categories based on the type of information being verified:"}, {"title": "Research Methodology", "content": "This review conducts a systematic literature review based on the detailed approach described in [51].

These methods are organised into a taxonomy (Fig 4) and broadly classified into two authentication processes: authentication and continuous authentication.The categorisation was based on the operational purposes, process and core principles of the methods.\nThe distinction between authentication and continuous authentication methods lies in their approach to identity verification. Authentication methods typically verify identity at the initial login, while continuous authentication methods involve ongoing monitoring of user behaviour, device characteristics and environmental factors throughout a session [68], [91-92]. Authentication methods were further classified based on their operational purposes. For example, methods designed to defend against attacks during authentication, such as fake biometrics or identity forgery, were categorised as authentication defence methods. Conversely, methods that solely address authentication system functionality were classified under authentication. Following this second-round classification, a detailed examination of each method's operational principles, functional components, and implementation techniques was conducted to ensure clear and systematic categorisation.\nThis review revealed that biometric recognition is the sole method applied for authentication. Methods targeting authentication attacks, such as fake biometrics or identity forgeries, rely on visual anomaly detection, which is further divided into feature-based and deep learning-based approaches. For continuous authentication, all methods fall under user behaviour anomaly detection, where User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) serves as the foundational framework. This framework was further examined through two key technical components: profiling models and analytical techniques [91]. The review articles were categorised accordingly to analyse the methods used for constructing behavioural profiles and the analytical techniques applied for anomaly detection, offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying technologies."}, {"title": "Framework and Frequency Analysis for Open Challenges", "content": "The open challenges identified in this study were examined using the Adaptive Enterprise Architecture (EA) framework [89], which addresses key aspects critical to industrial projects and enterprise decision-making.

As shown in TABLE 8, 55.81% of the methods are predominantly applied to authentication, whereas 44.91 % are designed for continuous authentication, reflecting a growing emphasis on adaptive and ongoing verification mechanisms.\nAs shown in Fig 6 biometric authentication is the most commonly used method in authentication, accounting for 79% (19/24) of authentication-related articles. Among these, 36.8% (7/19) focus on performance improvements in biometric recognition systems, while 63.2% (12/19) address their vulnerabilities. Notably, facial recognition emerges as the most discussed biometric method, appearing in 12 articles within this category.\nVisual anomaly detection is identified as the primary defence mechanism in authentication processes, representing 39.35% of the total articles reviewed. In contrast, continuous authentication methods exclusively rely on user behaviour anomaly detection, which accounts for 44.19% of the articles.\nThis distribution provides a foundation for analysing the operational principles, related techniques, and specific challenges of each method, as elaborated in the subsequent sections."}, {"title": "AI-based IDF Prevention and Detection Method: Authentication", "content": "This section focuses on two AI-based authentication methods: biometric recognition and visual anomaly detection. Each method is analysed in detail based on its operational principles, including core components and related implementation"}, {"title": "AI-based authentication method: biometrics recognition", "content": "This section analyses the biometric recognition system in terms of its operational components and examines the open challenges identified through frequency analysis.\nOperational Principle Biometrics refers to the process of identifying individuals by capturing and analysing their unique physical or behavioural characteristics using electronic devices, such as face, fingerprints, signature, voice, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chirp Sound [14], [25],[27], [32], [36], [42] as shown in Fig 7. Biometrics, characterised by their inherent uniqueness and reliability, offer a more effective method for verifying the authenticity of an individual's identity [27],[53]. As shown in Fig. 5, a biometric recognition system is composed of the following modules: sensor, feature extraction, matching, and decision-making [53]. The process flow for authentication is depicted by the directional arrows, highlighting the sequence from input data acquisition to final decision-making.\n\u2022 The Sensor Module is responsible for capturing a user's biometric information, like cameras on smartphones, fingerprint scanners, and microphones [27], [41].\n\u2022 The Feature Extraction Module is used to extract key biometric measures, making the system more effective at identity recognition [42]. For example, facial features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are crucial for enabling machines to identify individuals. are applied to strengthen these features and improve the accuracy of facial recognition systems.\n\u2022 The Matching Module is used to compare the newly captured biometric template with the one stored in the database [32]. There are two approaches: one-to-one and one-to-many. In a one-to-one matching system, the biometric template of the verified user is already stored in the system. A common example is a smartphone's identity verification system [22],[24],[25]. In a one-to-many matching, there is no pre-stored biometric template, which means the individual's identity is unknown [32]. The system must search a large database to identify the person. An example of this is the watch list screening conducted by financial institutions before onboarding customers [32].\n\u2022 The Decision Module is the system that makes the final decision after the comparison. If the matching result shows a high similarity, the authentication is approved; if the similarity is low, the authentication is denied.\nOpen Challenges TABLE 9 summarises the key challenges identified in biometric recognition systems based on the findings of this review. These challenges highlight critical limitations in the current state of the technology, including data quality, system resilience, implementation effectiveness and security vulnerabilities, which are detailed below."}, {"title": "AI-based authentication defence method: visual anomaly detection", "content": "This section analyses the visual anomaly detection system in terms of its key implementation techniques. Additionally, it summarises the detection techniques, targeted features, addressed attack types, and the algorithms or models in table and examines the open challenges identified through frequency analysis to provide insights into the limitations of current methods.\nOperational Principle Visual anomaly detection is a method designed to detect abnormal or unexpected patterns in images and videos that are different from the expected form as defined [54]. This technique is implemented within recognition systems to enhance the matching accuracy with more detailed features, as highlighted in the designated region of the authentication process (Fig 5). Among the articles discussing vulnerabilities in authentication systems, their main focus is to counter biometric spoofing and deepfake and ID document forgery attacks.

Additionally, the open challenges were identified through frequency analysis."}, {"title": "AI-based Continuous authentication method: user behaviour anomaly detection", "content": "User behaviour anomaly detection utilises AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, to identify deviations from normal behaviour in user profiles. In the reviewed articles, the analysis reveals the application of methods based on UEBA, a widely adopted approach in industrial practices [92]. These methods construct user profiles by analysing user behaviour patterns and their interactions with entities such as devices and applications [91]. This profile serves as a baseline for the users and is compared with real-time user data to identify potential anomalies [91-92]. Fig 8 shows the three pillars that underpin the functionality of the UEBA tool.\nThe user behaviour anomaly detection methods are analysed using the dimensions of the UEBA framework. The analysis is organised into five key aspects: (a) core data for user profile creation, (b) profile modelling techniques, (c) analytics techniques, (d) use cases, and (e) open challenges.\nCore Data for User Profile Construction User profiles provide an important baseline for analysing user behaviour patterns and detecting anomalies [91]. Fig 7 illustrates the data and feature elements identified in the reviewed articles. These components, essential for user profile construction, are categorised as follows:\n\u2022 Personal information: basic details such as name, date of birth, address, email address, phone, etc. [1], [2], [3], [12].\n\u2022 Behavioural Patterns: the typical actions and interactions that users exhibit within a system. It includes these categories as in the followings:\nDevice interaction: user's interaction with such as touchscreen [30], zoom gestures [29], keystrokes [28], browser fingerprint [3] and sensor [39].\nLogin activity: frequency, time, and location of logins [9].\nSocial features: user data linked to an account and its posts on an online social platform, such as friend counts, like counts, comments, etc. [16], [17], [21], [35], [9].\nTransaction history: details of performed transactions, including amounts and recipients, etc., [4], [5], [6], [7], [9].\nCommunication patterns: the distinctive ways individuals express themselves through language, such as word choice, sentence structure, tone, and writing styles [8], [17], [20], [35],[16]."}, {"title": "Open Challenges", "content": "The open challenges in user behaviour anomaly detection reveal a complex interplay of technical and non-technical factors, with non-technical issues, such as changing user behaviour and data privacy regulations, being the most frequently highlighted. Key technical challenges include the limited diversity of datasets and the lack of transferability of techniques to real-world use cases. The following section elaborates on these challenges derived from TABLE 14:\n\u2022 Dynamic user behaviour, shaped by factors such as changing life events, priorities, and preferences, introduces significant variability that impacts the detection accuracy of methods [28], [29], [30]. [35], [39]. Consequently, anomalies in data do not necessarily indicate actual abnormal behaviour. As noted in [3], detected anomalies may include cases involving normal users. To mitigate this issue, incorporating expert opinions and business-specific rules has been suggested in [3] and [7] to refine models and reduce false positives.\n\u2022 Threshold misconfiguration is a frequently cited challenge affecting accuracy. While the rules outlined in [3] and [7] effectively distinguish normal users from anomalies, improper threshold settings can still lead to false negatives or false positives. Achieving an optimal balance in rule configuration remains a critical challenge, as it directly impacts detection performance and system reliability.\n\u2022 Restricted access to privacy data and user consent emerge as two key highlights identified in the review. Studies such as [3], [7], and [28] have raised concerns about accessing private user data for training purposes. Additionally, [5] and [9] discuss the impact of user consent policies on model performance and validation, particularly when users withdraw their data after training, posing challenges to both compliance and model reliability.\n\u2022 Inconsistent performance across diverse datasets is a frequently observed issue, particularly in cases involving imbalanced datasets [29], [8]. This challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of labelled true fraud cases in user behaviour anomaly detection, which limits the model's ability to learn and generalise suspicious features due to insufficient data representation [8]. Additionally, studies such as [1], [20], and [35] identify challenges associated with real-time datasets and datasets tailored to varying use cases. For instance, while some methods effectively detect shared device relationships, they often lack sensitivity to subtle anomalies in individual behavioural characteristics. These findings highlight the difficulties in achieving consistent and reliable performance across diverse and dynamic datasets.\n\u2022 Technique complexity is a significant factor impacting method effectiveness, particularly for those requiring intricate data processing and modelling [39], [20], [4], [6]. For instance, [39] describes a method that processes multiple sources of sensor data through unification, sequence conversion, and subsequent model training and classification. This multi-step pipeline is resource-intensive and poorly suited for large-scale datasets, creating significant barriers to real-time applications."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This section addresses the research questions by analysing the findings and their broader implications.

These methods often struggle to detect inputs outside the learned patterns.\n\u2022 Resilience: The limited transferability of techniques is the second major challenge. This suggests that while current AI methods perform well on familiar patterns, their performance significantly declines when applied to unfamiliar scenarios, such as dynamic or real-world environments. These challenges underscore the need for more robust and adaptable approaches to address the evolving nature of identity fraud.\n\u2022 Accuracy: Data quality is critical for the accuracy of IDF detection methods. Challenges arise from noisy samples and inadequate preprocessing techniques. Addressing these issues requires diverse data sampling"}, {"title": "Challenge 2:Contextual Variability", "content": "Although significant research has been conducted on identity fraud, the understanding of its complex dynamics and mechanisms remains limited. One of the primary challenges is the continuous evolution of fraud tactics driven by advancing fraudulent technologies and emerging real-world threats, such as the rise of GAI. Business data from companies can assist in identifying suspicious patterns and labelling data for machine learning; however, this often occurs after fraud has already taken place. When new patterns emerge, models frequently struggle to make accurate predictions or adapt to novel situations.\nDynamic user behaviours further complicate the issue. As user behaviour constantly evolves, baseline patterns established by these methods may no longer hold true. Additionally, anomalies identified by detection systems do not always indicate actual fraud. Further analysis is often required to distinguish true fraud from benign outliers [3], [7]."}, {"title": "Challenge 3:Data Privacy and Security Issues", "content": "Data privacy and security remain critical in identity fraud detection. Data privacy regulation has restricted the use of privacy data, which is essential for good model performance.\nAlthough data encryption techniques have been applied for years, encrypted data will comprise the model performance to find meaningful information from the data, especially in today's context, where contextual data are used by an increasing number of researchers [28].\nThe challenge extends to protecting private data stored in centralised databases, a common practice among many organisations [9]. Centralised storage increases the risk of identity theft, especially when AI models rely on such data for training. Though federated Learning is effective in some cases, it's not always a viable solution [9]. This is particularly true for global issues like identity fraud, which spans across multiple industries and sectors rather than being confined to a single company.

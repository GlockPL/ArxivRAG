However, these models are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are becoming increasingly dangerous as models become increasingly powerful. In this work, we introduce a dataset of jailbreaks where each example can be input in both a single or a multi-turn format. We show that while equivalent in content, they are not equivalent in jailbreak success: defending against one structure does not guarantee defense against the other. Similarly, LLM-based filter guardrails also perform differently depending on not just the input content but the input structure. Thus, vulnerabilities of frontier models should be studied in both single and multi-turn settings; this dataset provides a tool to do so.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Single-turn attacks are the most extensively explored in the literature surrounding LLMs (Wei et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2024). That is, a single prompt containing a nefarious instruction is passed to the LLM and any guardrails it may have, with the goal of bypassing the safety measures in order to extract harmful results from the model. This type of prompting is absolutely one part of the equation. However, with newer models seeing increases in the size of their context window, multi-turn prompting is becoming an increasingly legitimate option for jailbreak attacks. In a multi-turn attack, harmful instructions can be spread over multiple inputs, thereby potentially reducing the perceived harmfulness of each individual input and exploiting safety measures that assess each one in isolation.\nThis paper introduces a new dataset and framework that begins to systematically address this issue, establishing the threat that multi-turn attacks pose and demonstrating the need for further research into this class of jailbreak. By constructing examples that can be input in one turn or multiple, and where the harmfulness is obscured when viewing pieces of each example in isolation, we highlight a qualitative difference between single and multi-turn attacks: the prompting structure asymmetry (see Section 4.1), quantifying the difference in successful attacks in the two attack formats, is as high as 50% for some models."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": "There is a growing body of literature demonstrating novel approaches to red-teaming LLMs. As capabilities improve, the potential complexity of jailbreak attacks grows in kind. The research space is expanding rapidly as it attempts to keep up with the rate of improvement of the models themselves. We note that some attack methods, such as ciphered attacks (Handa et al., 2024) and multi-turn attacks (Zhou et al., 2024), are only effective on models past a certain capability threshold due to the complex enciphering/deciphering and context tracking required to engage with these attacks."}, {"title": "Ciphered Attacks", "content": "Ciphered attacks are emerging as a powerful tool for red-teaming. Whilst there is some evidence that safety fine-tuning can generalise across languages (Ouyang et al., 2022), Wei et al. (2024) theorise that safety training may not generalise far enough out of distribution to neutralise this attack method. Recent work supports this, proving word substitution ciphers to be effective at masking harmful content in a jailbreak attack (Handa et al., 2024). Similarly, Yuan et al. (2023) demonstrated the threat that Caesar-ciphers (among others) pose, with experimental results suggesting that 73.4% of GPT-4 responses to Caesar-cipher attacks were marked as \"unsafe\". Results on other models were less conclusive as Claude2 and variations of Llama2-Chat struggled to produce valid outputs, lending credibility to the idea that increases in model capabilities will see a correlated increase in the complexity of successful jailbreak strategies.\nFurthermore, Jiang et al. (2024) introduced an ASCII art-based jailbreak attack that had an average \"Attack Success Rate\" of 52% across the five models tested. Additionally this type of attack had an average \"Harmfulness Score\" of 3.60 out of 5.00 (higher is more harmful) suggesting that ciphering jailbreaks using ASCII art could also pose a threat to the safety of LLMs.\nThese studies all point to the threat that ciphered methods of attack currently pose and it is feasible that such methods could be hard to counter, as improved capabilities will continually expand the complexity of ciphers that can be successfully utilised as part of a jailbreak. In light of this research, we include ciphering in our red-teaming approach to strengthen our attacks, making them more challenging for the LLMs to detect."}, {"title": "Detecting Adversarial Attacks", "content": "Perplexity-based filters have been shown to be effective at detecting adversarial behaviour (Jain et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024). Hence, some models or guardrails may be suspicious of nonsense strings of text, which are prevalent in gradient-based/adaptive jailbreak attacks.\nThe word substitution cipher method proposed by Handa et al. (2024) is likely to be more frequently blocked by perplexity-based filters, given its strategy of mapping random words to each word in the instruction. We test this random word mapping approach, as well as an adapted version designed to minimise the overall perplexity of our prompts."}, {"title": "Multi-Turn Attacks", "content": "Multi-turn attacks are less covered in the literature, though Zhou et al. (2024) explored these attacks, proving that they can present a unique challenge when compared with single-turn attacks. Decomposing harmful prompts into less harmful sub-prompts has been explored (Kang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b) in a single-turn setting. In an alternative approach to multi-turn jailbreaking, Microsoft introduced Crescendo (Russinovich et al., 2024) which was able to elicit harmful information from LLMs by gradually steering benign initial prompts towards more harmful topics. This work allows prompting devoid of adversarial text, highlighting the need for frontier models to track harmful context and not just harmful language. Recent work (Yang et al., 2024) follows a similar approach. The drawback of such an approach is the challenge involved in isolating the effect of the prompting-structure, due to Crescendo and similar attacks, by definition, not being well suited to single-turn prompting structures.\nContrasted against previous work, this paper takes a combination approach to multi-turn attacks. Our methodology enables us to explore the dynamics of single-turn vs multi-turn prompting within a ciphered attack similar to those outlined in Yuan et al. (2023) and Handa et al. (2024)."}, {"title": "Concurrent Work", "content": "Work by Li et al. (2024a) explores vulnerabilities in LLMs when exposed to multi-turn human-driven jailbreaks. They find that LLMs are seriously vulnerable to such attacks, even when they are well-defended against automated single-turn jailbreaks. Our work uniquely contributes by directly comparing single-turn and multi-turn attacks within the same framework, enabling closely controlled experiments like we conduct on how prompt structure impacts attack success rates. Both studies emphasise the effectiveness of multi-turn jailbreaks, providing complementary evidence for the critical need to go beyond single-turn setups to strengthen LLM defences."}, {"title": "Data and Methods", "content": null}, {"title": "Dataset Construction", "content": "Overview In this paper, the primary goal of multi-turn attacks is to distribute harm over multiple prompts, rendering each prompt essentially harmless in isolation. Therefore, the LLM is required to assess the set of prompts in its totality in order to understand the true nature of the question.\nTo establish that multi-turn jailbreak attacks can present a unique and novel failure mode for LLMs, we expand on the word substitution cipher approach (Handa et al., 2024). We modify it to allow for multi-turn attacks, in addition to the original single-turn method. This approach enables us to isolate the impact of the prompting structure, by testing identical prompts packaged in both a single-turn manner and a multi-turn one.\nWe define input-only datasets as ones that contain only the user-side interaction prompts, excluding the assistant's responses. This contrasts with conversation datasets that include both user prompts and assistant messages. We create three input-only datasets:\n\u2022 Harmful dataset: Contains prompts intended to elicit harmful information from the model. In total there are 4136 observations in this dataset.\n\u2022 Completely-benign dataset: Contains prompts that are entirely benign, with no toxic words or attempts to solicit dangerous information from the model. In total there are 1200 observations in this dataset.\n\u2022 Semi-benign dataset: Contains prompts with a relatively benign meaning but includes toxic words. These prompts do not attempt to solicit dangerous information from the model. For example, prompting the model for information on the \u201cBest ways to prevent domestic abuse\". In total there are 1200 observations in this dataset.\nThe harmful dataset is used to attempt to jailbreak the models, while the benign datasets serve as controls in Section 3.4. Additionally, we are releasing a complete harmful dataset to aid future research (see Appendix H). This dataset contain inputs, responses from the models and the hand-labelled classifications.\nHarmful Dataset Generation We had two main requirements for the harmful dataset:\n\u2022 Effective comparison between single-turn and multi-turn attacks. This requires that the prompts are structured in such a way as to allow near-identical attacks, varying only the prompting structure (single or multi-turn)."}, {"title": null, "content": "\u2022 At least some effectiveness at jailbreaking the models. Unsophisticated attacks, such as those that do not contain any form of ciphering or deception, will almost certainly be flagged up by the model, regardless of prompting structure. It is the grey area, in which the models somewhat struggle with single-turn attacks but aren't completely susceptible to them, that is the most valuable to explore.\nWith these two requirements in mind, an adapted implementation of the Handa et al. (2024) word substitution cipher approach is appropriate. Here, the model is given pairs of words and instructed to map one to the other, leading to final instructions that seem benign but map to something harmful. This approach has not only been shown to be effective at jailbreaking in the single-turn format but also allows for a multi-turn variant of the attack. Specifically, we make multi-turn attacks with prompts that are benign when viewed in isolation, simply by subdividing the single-turn prompt at strategic points.\nWe test two variants: random word mapping, where substituted words are chosen at random (leading to the final instruction being nonsensical before decoding); and perplexity filtered word mapping, where substitutions are chosen to try and maintain the final instruction's semantic coherence. We note that provisional testing showed that attacks without any input cipher had an extremely low success rate, and thus those were not explored further.\nWe also explore the impact of asking the model to provide output in ciphered form, to observe if this amplifies the potency of the attacks, or exacerbates any differences observed between prompting structures. For this, we focus on the Caesar-cipher due to its simplicity and the limited capacity of the models to interpret more complex ciphers.\nTo generate the harmful dataset, three components are combined into predefined templates (outlined in Appendices A and B):\n1. The harmful goal, taken from the Zou et al. (2023) harmful_behaviours dataset.\n2. A word mapping, that replaces harmful or instructive words with benign words. This is generated by Mixtral-8x7b.\n3. A \"priming sentence\", which directs the model towards a harmful output by telling it what \"step 1\" of the response should look like. This was shown in Handa et al. (2024) to be more effective than word substitution alone.\nA benign example of this would be:\n1. Goal: write an academic paper.\n2. Word mapping: build = write; interesting = academic; birdhouse = paper.\n3. Priming sentence: the first point should be \"Step 1: Choose a topic\".\nThe result of this would be the encoded prompt \"build an interesting birdhouse\" which would be paired with some instructions to the LLM on how to decode the prompt and what the first line of its response should be.\nThe step-by-step process of this implementation is as follows (see Figure 1 for a visual representation):\n1. Initially, an augmented version of the Zou et al. (2023) harmful_behaviours dataset is generated by combining \"priming sentences\" and goals. Mixtral-8x7b is used to create the priming sentence for each goal to guide the model towards the target output.\n2. A nefarious goal is then randomly selected from the augmented dataset, dictating the desired harmful information that we will try and elicit from the LLM being tested.\n3. Following this, Mixtral-8x7b identifies harmful and instructive words in the goal, to be replaced as part of the word substitution approach.\n4. The next step depends on the input-cipher specified. Two word mapping approaches have been implemented: random word mapping and perplexity filtered word mapping. In the case of random word mapping:"}, {"title": null, "content": "\u2022 The harmful/instructive words are replaced with words from a randomly sampled dictio- nary.\nWhereas for perplexity filtered word mapping:\n\u2022 A final call to Mixtral-8x7b identifies words that, when substituted with the harm- ful/instructive words would maintain the sentence's semantic coherence, decreasing the perplexity of the input that is passed to the LLM.\n5. Following this, the overall prompt template is constructed using a predefined python script. In cases where an output-cipher is used, the instruction for this is also added to the prompt.\n6. Finally, the prompt is stored verbatim for testing the single-turn approach and subdivided into multiple smaller prompts for testing the multi-turn approach. See Appendix A for more information about the single-turn version, and Appendix B for the multi-turn one.\nBenign Dataset Generation The construction of the benign datasets is essentially identical to that of the harmful dataset. The main differences are as follows:\n\u2022 For the harmful dataset generation, we used the harmful_behaviours as the list of goals. For the benign datasets, ChatGPT-4o is used to generate the two lists of goals (completely benign and benign with toxic words).\n\u2022 Rather than identifying harmful and instructive words in the goal to be replaced, Mixtral-8x7b is used to identify the \"key words\" in a goal."}, {"title": "Testing the Models", "content": "To compare single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attacks, we test each prompt in two different formats where only the prompting structure varies. Due to time and budget constraints, only prompts with Caesar-cipher output and no output-cipher were sampled for the testing phase. The outputs were then hand-labelled by the authors as \u201c(0) Not Jailbroken\u201d, \u201c(1) Jailbroken\u201d, or \u201c(2) Ambiguous\u201d. In parallel, they are also given an \"understood the question\u201d (UTQ) label of \u201c(0) Model did not understand the question", "1: Model understood the question": "or", "2": "Ambiguous"}, {"title": "Guardrails", "content": "To further evaluate the effectiveness of multi-turn, ciphered attacks and their ability to bypass safety measures, we evaluate them against LLMs with augmented security guardrails attached. Four different instances of guardrails were used, with each instance being tested with both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4:\n\u2022 NeMoGuardrails, without conversational awareness.\n\u2022 NeMoGuardrails, with conversational awareness.\n\u2022 Our own in-house LLM Judge system, without conversational awareness.\n\u2022 Our own in-house LLM Judge system, with conversational awareness.\nAdditional description of these guardrails, which use LLMs to determine whether a prompt contains harmful content, are provided in Appendix F. By default, NeMoGuardrails runs on GPT-3.5 with a set of starter guardrail prompts and isn't conversationally aware, i.e., it assesses each prompt in isolation with no conversation history or context. To simulate more possible implementations of NeMoGuardrails we run tests with the more powerful GPT-4 and configure NeMoGuardrails to be conversationally aware (see the entire conversation history). We test the same variations with our simpler LLM Judge evaluating the inputs. We also test guardrails on the single-turn version of the dataset, in which all instructions are contained within one prompt. Further, as a control, we test them on the benign datasets described in 3.1. In all cases, if any individual message in the conversation is classified as non-benign, we consider the attack \"blocked\" by the guardrail."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": null}, {"title": "Prompting Structure Asymmetry", "content": "On average, single-turn prompts jailbroke the models 21.0% of the time and multi-turn prompts jailbroke the models 24.1% of the time - making multi-turn attacks marginally more successful than single-turn attacks. To assess more deeply whether there is a qualitative difference between the two, we examine what percentage of prompts jailbroke in one format but not in the other. We refer to this as prompting structure asymmetry.\nFigure 2 shows that there are a significant number of attacks that successfully jailbreak the models in one format but fail to do so in the other format. For example, 41.7% of successful attacks on Claude-3-Opus were attacks that succeeded in multi-turn format but failed in single-turn format; only 8.3% of successful attacks succeeded in single-turn format but failed in multi-turn format. This gives Claude-3-Opus a total prompting structure asymmetry of 50%, exposing a limitation of evaluating the safety of a model using only the currently available single-turn datasets. In this case, 41.7% of all successful jailbreaks would have been missed in single-turn-only testing, leading developers to systematically underestimate the vulnerabilities of the model.\nOn the other hand, every time that GPT-3.5 was jailbroken in multi-turn format, the attack was also successful when structured as a single prompt. But the inverse was not true: 33.3% of the time, multi-turn attacks failed to jailbreak the model where their single-turn counterparts succeeded."}, {"title": "Factoring In Model Comprehension", "content": "Table 1 highlights the percentage of attacks that were understood by the model (see Appendix C for the definition of a model 'understanding' a question), broken down by prompting structure. Comprehension varied significantly between models. Claude-3-Opus and Llama3-70B understood a large proportion of attacks from both prompting structures, whereas GPT-3.5 struggled to understand either prompting structure.\nFiltering for only attacks in which the model understood the question being asked of it, we see slightly higher attack success rates - 28.7% on average for single-turn attacks and 36.1% for multi-turn attacks - suggesting that model comprehension may be a limiting factor in overall attack success rates.\nWe see in Figure 3 that when assessing only instances where the model understood both the single-turn and multi-turn variations of the attack, the vast majority of prompting structure asymmetry originates from attacks that successfully jailbroke the model in multi-turn format but failed to do so in single-turn format. This suggests that much of the asymmetry may be explained by the model struggling to understand the more complex multi-turn equivalents of successful single-turn attacks. Consequently, this would imply that multi-turn attacks, when understood, may be more challenging for LLM defences and hence, multi-turn attacks may be a more potent jailbreak method. We recommend further research to expand the robustness and scope of this assessment.\nFurthermore, in Figure 2 the models are ordered by their Elo ranking as per Chiang et al. (2024). Though not completely reliable Boubdir et al. (2023), this can be interpreted as an approximation of model capacity. There does not seem to be evidence to suggest that more capable models develop an immunity to this asymmetry. This is a concern with future, more capable models that are both more likely to understand the question, and to cause harm if jailbroken."}, {"title": "Comparison of Input-Ciphers", "content": "Assessing the effect of input-ciphers across all models, we see that the success rates for the different input-ciphers were fairly similar (see Table 2), with random word replacement appearing at least as successful as perplexity-filtered mappings across the board \u2013 and sometimes marginally better."}, {"title": "Comparison of Output-Ciphers", "content": "On the other hand, when investigating the efficacy of output-ciphers across all models, we find that when the model understood the question, prompts specifying the use of a Caesar-cipher were overwhelmingly more successful than prompts that did not require an output-cipher. Table 2 shows that Caesar-cipher attack efficacy was almost double that of non-ciphered outputs for both single and multi-turn attacks, when model comprehension was controlled for. The authors speculate that this increase in jailbreak success may be due to an imperfect correlation between a model's ability to track complex attacks and its robustness against them. In other words, a model has capabilities in domains that safety fine-tuning does not yet reach. This idea has been explored in previous work by Wei et al. (2024).\nHowever, there was no notable difference between non-ciphered outputs and Caesar-ciphered outputs when model understanding was not factored in. This is likely due to the complex nature of Caesar-ciphers and the models generally struggling to perform this task. We suggest that as LLM capabilities increase, model comprehension of ciphered requests will increase in kind \u2013 which given the UTQ jailbreaking rates, could pose an issue for safety."}, {"title": "Guardrails", "content": "In Table 3, we examine the performance of guardrails to block these attacks. Our multi-turn cipher attacks bypass NeMo Guardrails over 50% of the time. This happens even more frequently when it is granted access to the entire conversation, even though in theory that should let it piece together the harmful instructions, suggesting the NeMo systems aren't optimised for blocking multi-turn attacks. However, systems powered by GPT-4 achieved much higher blocking rates, not letting any attacks through. Despite these strong results, Table 4 indicates that more capable NeMoGuardrails systems powered by GPT-4 are overzealous, as they flagged completely-benign prompts 96.1% of the time."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Our results suggest substantial discrepancies between single and multi-turn jailbreak success rates. However, due to limited experiment budget and labeller time, we note that the dataset has limitations in sample size, and prompts were only run once. Potentially, there could be random variations in which prompts produce successful jailbreaks, rather than single vs. multi-turn variations. While unlikely to account for the entire effects, given multiple models in Figure 2 showing a clear asymmetry in one direction or the other, this could impact the size of the effect. Future research with greater resources would be useful in establishing a clear pattern from a larger dataset with multiple runs."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "These findings highlight that increased protection against single-turn jailbreak attempts is not a guarantee of protection against multi-turn jailbreak attempts - and vice versa. Most notably, prompts with identical content can produce different outcomes depending on how the input is structured. Furthermore, our results show that some guardrails\u2014particularly, our LLM Judge\u2014are promising at defending against multi-turn attacks. However, such guardrails require careful implementation to ensure that only harmful behaviour is blocked, and a sufficiently capable model is required, to enable the guardrails to understand more complicated attacks. Given this, defenses are currently hard to actualise, and may be even more challenging in future superalignment scenarios, where there is no guarantee that an equally capable AI will be available to provide guardrails. Overall, there is a lack of research into multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn. The authors propose that investment into multi-turn datasets is a necessity.\nOne recommendation for building on this dataset is to introduce additional ciphers to diversify the method of attack. Key areas of interest are leetspeak and base64 (Wei et al., 2024; Handa et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024). However, there is a constraint on the complexity of viable ciphers, due to the limitations of current models. As capabilities improve it may be possible, and necessary, to test more sophisticated ciphers.\nWe release our datasets publicly to aid future research, as detailed in Appendix H. Overall, our data and analysis provide a springboard for future investigations into emerging conversational vulnerabilities in frontier models."}, {"title": "Acknowledgements", "content": "We thank Berkeley SPAR for connecting collaborators and funding support.

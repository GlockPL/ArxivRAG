INTRODUCTION", "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a multifaceted neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 100 children worldwide and 1 in 36 children in North America [1]. It is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication challenges, and repetitive behaviors. Children with ASD often experience sensory sensitivities and exhibit a spectrum of symptoms that vary widely in severity [2]. The increasing prevalence of autism has highlighted it as a critical public health concern, underscoring the need for early diagnosis and intervention. Despite advances in understanding ASD, its management remains complex due to the diverse manifestations in each individual [3].\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of ASD require a multidisciplinary approach, involving various healthcare professionals who play essential roles [4]. The diagnostic process typically begins with pediatricians conducting initial screenings based on developmental milestones. If concerns are identified, children are referred to specialists such as psychologists for comprehensive evaluations using standardized tests and behavioral observations [5]. Speech therapists assess and address communication difficulties, while occupational therapists focus on enhancing daily living skills and sensory processing [6]. Psychiatrists may manage co-occurring conditions like anxiety or ADHD, and cardiologists might be involved to address any related physical health concerns. This collaborative approach is vital for developing tailored treatment plans that meet each child's unique needs [7].\n\nA primary challenge in diagnosing ASD is the variability in symptom presentation, which can lead to inconsistent screenings and diagnoses. Different practitioners may employ varied diagnostic tools and criteria, resulting in conflicting evaluations. Additionally, maintaining consistency and continuity in treatment presents significant difficulties [8]. Treatment plans often involve multiple sessions with different therapists, and the absence of a standardized system for documenting and sharing treatment histories complicates the transition of care among professionals. This fragmented approach can impede effective communication and coordination among healthcare providers, adversely affecting the quality of care. Furthermore, parents and caregivers may find it challenging to access and manage the extensive records necessary for consistent treatment, further complicating the overall management of ASD.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) presents a promising solution to the complexities involved in diagnosing and treating Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) [6]. AI-powered tools have the potential to standardize the diagnostic process by analyzing extensive datasets to uncover patterns and correlations that might be overlooked by human evaluators. This can result in more accurate and consistent diagnoses. In terms of treatment, AI can aid in the development of personalized therapy plans that adapt to a child's progress over time [9]. AI-driven algorithm can consolidate data from various sources, providing a comprehensive view of the patient's history and facilitating seamless communication among different healthcare providers. By continuously monitoring and analyzing treatment data, AI can assist in making real-time adjustments to therapy plans, ensuring that interventions remain effective and tailored to the individual's evolving needs [10]. Additionally, AI can support caregivers by providing insights and recommendations based on the latest research and clinical guidelines, ultimately enhancing the overall care and outcomes for children with ASD\n\nOur product aims to revolutionize the care and treatment of children with ASD by leveraging advanced AI technology. Designed to assist healthcare professionals and caregivers in delivering consistent, personalized, and effective care, the product integrates data from multiple sources, including diagnostic tools, treatment records, and real-time feedback from therapy sessions. The model analyzes this data to detect patterns and trends, informing more accurate diagnoses and optimized treatment plans. By offering a comprehensive, centralized system, our product ensures that all relevant information is readily accessible to all stakeholders involved in the care process.\n\nThe model, characterized by its exceptional accuracy, is designed to detect autism through the analysis of facial and bodily expressions in children, as well as to monitor the progression and severity of the disorder. The product boasts an intuitive interface, allowing healthcare professionals to effortlessly input and access patient data. The AI algorithms continuously learn from this data, thereby enhancing their precision and effectiveness in recommending targeted interventions. For caregivers, the product offers customized guidance and resources to support home-based therapy. By seamlessly bridging the gaps between various care sessions and practitioners, our product aims to enhance the overall coordination and quality of care for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder"}, {"title": "(ASD), ultimately leading to improved outcomes and a higher quality of life.", "content": "This paper makes three main contributions to the field of autism care and treatment through the application of Artificial Intelligence:\n\n1.

It also discusses strategies to mitigate biases in AI algorithms, ensuring equitable and reliable outcomes"}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) continues to be a complex endeavor due to the considerable variability in symptom presentation. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely heavily on clinical evaluations, behavioral assessments, and developmental histories, often utilizing standardized tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). However, these methods are susceptible to subjectivity and variability based on the examiner's expertise and interpretation. Research underscores the need for more objective and reliable diagnostic tools to minimize misdiagnosis and ensure early and accurate identification of ASD [11].\n\nTreatment for ASD typically involves a multidisciplinary strategy, encompassing behavioral therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and, in some cases, pharmacotherapy. The intricacy of these interventions, coupled with the necessity for continuous and consistent treatment, presents significant challenges. Studies indicate that inconsistent treatment approaches and fragmented care can impede progress and outcomes for individuals with ASD [12]. Maintaining a comprehensive and accessible record of past treatments and interventions is crucial, yet often problematic due to the lack of standardized documentation systems.\n\nWith technological advancements, there is a growing interest in utilizing Al models to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of ASD. Telehealth, for instance, has emerged as a viable option for providing access to diagnostic services and therapeutic interventions, particularly in underserved areas [13]. Additionally, mobile applications and digital platforms are being developed to assist in tracking and managing ASD symptoms and treatments. While these technologies offer promising solutions, they also present challenges related to usability, accessibility, and data security [14].\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has shown substantial potential in revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare, including diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient management. Machine Learning, especially those utilizing machine learning and deep learning, can analyze extensive datasets to identify patterns and make highly accurate predictions. In the context of ASD, AI can enhance diagnostic accuracy by analyzing behavioral data, speech patterns, and other pertinent metrics that may be challenging for human evaluators to interpret consistently [15].\n\nSeveral studies have investigated the application of AI in diagnosing ASD. For instance, deep learning models have been designed to analyze facial expressions, eye movements, and other behavioral cues captured in videos to differentiate between children with ASD and neurotypical children [16]. These models can process and learn from large datasets, potentially leading to more accurate and earlier diagnoses. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the quality and diversity of the training data, as well as the robustness of the algorithms employed.\n\nAl's capability to analyze complex datasets can also be utilized to develop personalized treatment plans for individuals with ASD. By integrating data from various sources, including clinical evaluations, therapy sessions, and real-time feedback from caregivers, AI can help create and adjust individualized treatment plans that are responsive to the specific needs and progress of the patient [17]. This approach can enhance the effectiveness of interventions and improve outcomes by ensuring that treatments are continuously optimized based on the latest available data.\n\nDespite the promise AI holds in enhancing ASD care, several challenges and ethical considerations need to be addressed. Data privacy and security are paramount concerns, particularly when handling sensitive health information [18]. Ensuring that AI systems are transparent and explainable is also crucial to build trust among users and allow healthcare professionals to understand and validate Al-generated recommendations [19]. Moreover, efforts must be made to mitigate biases in AI algorithms that could arise from unrepresentative training data.\n\nSeveral case studies have demonstrated the practical applications of AI in ASD care. For example, a study by Washington et al. [20] used Al to analyze home videos of children and achieved a high accuracy rate in identifying ASD traits. Another study employed machine learning algorithms to analyze speech patterns and successfully distinguished between children with ASD and those without the disorder [21]. These studies underscore the potential of Al to provide valuable insights and support to healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process.\n\nThe integration of AI in ASD care is still in its nascent stages, with significant potential for future development. Research is ongoing to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AI models and to expand their applications to include more aspects of ASD care. Collaborative efforts between Al researchers, clinicians, and caregivers will be essential to ensure that AI tools are developed to meet the practical needs of those involved in ASD care [22]. Additionally, ongoing advancements in AI technology, such as the development of more sophisticated neural networks and improved data processing capabilities, are likely to drive further innovations in this field [23].\n\nIn summary, AI offers promising solutions to key challenges in diagnosing and treating ASD.

METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this study, we aimed to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to extract and evaluate facial and body expressions of autistic children to provides the healthcare professionals with summarization of the previous sessions, history of treatment and report if daily activities of the patient."}, {"title": "A. Facial and body insights", "content": "For extracting facial and body expressions, the methodology involves using transfer learning with several pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models known for their efficiency in image classification tasks. The primary models considered were VGG19, Xception, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0. These models were chosen due to their demonstrated performance in previous studies.\n\nThe methodology for extracting insights from videos of autistic children using deep learning encompasses a series of carefully designed steps to ensure thorough data preparation, model adaptation, and training. The initial phase, preprocessing, is crucial for preparing raw images for analysis. Each image in the dataset is resized to a consistent dimension that meets the input requirements of the selected convolutional neural network (CNN) models. For example, VGG19 requires images resized to 224x224 pixels, while Xception requires 299x299 pixels. Following resizing, normalization is applied, scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. This standardization enhances the model's learning efficiency. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and zooming, are employed to artificially increase the dataset size, introduce variability, and mitigate overfitting by simulating various real-world conditions.\n\nAfter preprocessing, the transfer learning approach utilizes pre-trained CNN models. These models, including VGG19, Xception, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0, are initialized with weights derived from training on the ImageNet dataset, which includes a vast array of images. To tailor the pre-trained models for the specific task of autism diagnosis, their final fully connected layers are modified. The original classification layers are replaced with new dense layers designed for binary classification. This adaptation typically involves adding a global average pooling layer to condense the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, followed by a dense layer with 512 units using ReLU activation. A dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 is included to prevent overfitting, and a final dense layer with a single unit and sigmoid activation is added to perform binary classification, distinguishing between autistic and non-autistic children.\n\nThe training procedure integrates preprocessing and transfer learning into a cohesive process designed to optimize model"}, {"title": "performance. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure that the models are evaluated on unseen data, providing a realistic measure of their generalization capabilities. An ablation study is conducted to fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. The Adagrad optimizer, known for its efficiency in handling sparse data, is selected", "content": "based on superior performance observed during preliminary tests. The learning rate is set to 0.001, striking a balance between the speed and stability of convergence. A batch size of 32 is chosen to balance computational efficiency with the stability of the training process, and the number of epochs is set to 50 to allow sufficient training iterations while preventing overfitting.\n\nModel training involves several critical steps. Initially, the preprocessed images are fed into the network, where the modified CNN models perform a forward pass to generate predictions. The binary cross-entropy loss function calculates the discrepancy between predicted and actual labels, guiding the model in learning from its errors. Backpropagation is then used to compute gradients, which iteratively update the model weights. Throughout this process, the model's performance is monitored on the validation set after each epoch. Early stopping mechanisms are employed to halt training if the validation loss ceases to improve, thereby preventing overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning is a dynamic part of the training procedure, requiring multiple iterations to identify optimal settings. For instance, different learning rates are experimented with, and their impact on model performance is evaluated. Similarly, various batch sizes and epoch counts are tested to find the most effective configuration. This iterative process is crucial for achieving high accuracy and robust model performance. The comprehensive evaluation of these hyperparameters ensures that the model is neither underfitting nor overfitting, thus striking an optimal balance between bias and variance.\n\nThe final trained models are evaluated using a suite of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics provide a detailed assessment of the models' predictive capabilities. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model, precision evaluates the proportion of true positive predictions, recall assesses the model's ability to identify all positive instances, and AUC indicates the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different threshold settings."}, {"title": "B. Ethical Considerations and Bias Mitigation", "content": "In the process of the deployment of the model, it is imperative to address various ethical considerations and potential biases to ensure the technology is both effective and trustworthy. This section details the measures taken in our study to uphold ethical standards and mitigate biases, thereby promoting equitable and reliable outcomes.\n\nEnsuring the privacy and security of sensitive health data is paramount in AI applications within healthcare. Our study adheres to strict protocols to safeguard this information. Data anonymization is a key practice, where all patient data used in this study is anonymized to protect the identities of individuals. The anonymization process employs techniques such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness to further enhance privacy protection.\n\nAdditionally, data is stored in secure, encrypted databases that comply with industry standards and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Encryption algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are used to secure the data both at rest and during transmission. Access to the data is restricted to authorized personnel only, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized individuals. Role-based access controls (RBAC) are implemented to limit data handling to essential personnel, with access logs maintained to monitor data access activities.\n\nIn terms of data transmission security, secure protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are used to prevent unauthorized interception during data transfer processes. This ensures that data integrity and confidentiality are maintained throughout the communication channels.\n\nThe proposed model is designed to be transparent, with clear documentation of the algorithms and methods employed, including detailed descriptions of the training data, model architecture, and performance metrics. Techniques from the field of Explainable AI (XAI) are utilized to provide insights into how the AI models make decisions.\n\nTo ensure that Al systems do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases, our study employs several strategies for bias mitigation. Efforts are made to collect a diverse and representative dataset that includes data from various demographic groups, helping to train models that are not biased towards any particular group. Statistical methods and bias detection algorithms are used to identify any biases in the AI models. Techniques such as re-weighting, re-sampling, and algorithmic adjustments are applied to correct any detected biases.\n\nFinally, an ethical governance framework is established to oversee the development and deployment of the Al systems. An independent ethics review board evaluates the ethical implications of the AI systems and provides guidance on best practices. This board includes ethicists, legal experts, healthcare professionals, and patient representatives. Comprehensive ethical guidelines are developed and adhered to throughout the project, covering issues such as informed consent, data ownership, and the right to opt out of Al-driven interventions."}, {"title": "IV.

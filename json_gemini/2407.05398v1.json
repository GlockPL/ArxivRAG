Indeed, the quality of the predictions could influence the adoption of real-world interventions and possibly produce long-term implications for students [4].\nTo evaluate algorithmic fairness, which is broadly defined in [7], a new metric has been recently developed, namely the Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD) [9]. The interest of this metric is to measure how different a predictive model behaves regarding two groups, independently from its predictive performance, which will be further explained in part 2.1. However, precisely because it is independent from predictive performance, [9] recommend to use it for fairness evaluation on models that already demonstrate satisfying predictive performance to be used in real-world applications. Therefore, we would like to extend the use"}, {"title": "2 The Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD) metric", "content": "of this metric to unfairness mitigation as well, that is to say to improve the fairness of accurate but unfair results.\nThat is why, in this paper, we develop a fair post-processing method based on the MADD metric that improves the fairness of the results outputted by a model without compromising accuracy. It is important to note that this method improves the fairness of the results regarding a single chosen attribute only, since it is based on the MADD metric that evaluates fairness regarding a single attribute as well (see part 2.3). We then experiment with our approach on the task of predicting student success in an online course, using both simulated and real-world educational data, and for which our source code and data are in open access at https://github.com/melinaverger/MADD. Our results show that our method successfully improves the fairness without losing the accuracy of the results.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first describe the MADD metric in Section 2 in order to explain our MADD post-processing approach in Section 3. Then, we describe how we conducted our experiments in Section 4 and we report our results in Section 5. Finally, we discuss our approach in Section 6, and we conclude our paper in Section 7 with future work."}, {"title": "2.1 Motivation of its choice", "content": "Among the plethora of fairness metrics that have emerged from recent literature, we chose the MADD for our fair post-processing approach. The first reason is that it is a statistical metric. Indeed, fairness metrics mostly fall into three main classes, counterfactual (or causality-based), similarity-based (or individual), and statistical (or group) criteria [10,1], but so far the metrics from the first two classes are seldom used in practice [10]. Using the MADD ensures an easy integration for fairness improvement in existing applications.\nThe second reason is that, contrary to the other statistical metrics, the MADD is able to capture the severity of the predictive errors between the different groups of students in the data (further explained in part 2.3). Indeed, the principle of the existing metrics consists in making comparisons of any predictive performance of a model across groups (either by independence, separation or sufficiency [5]). However, two models producing any similar predictive error proportions across groups can still exhibit very different and possibly harmful errors themselves, which is not captured by these metrics. That is why, since the MADD is precisely not based on predictive performance (then a comparison) but on the intrinsic difference with which a models behaves regarding the groups, this metric is particularly relevant for improving fairness on this distinct aspect."}, {"title": "2.2 Preliminaries", "content": "To provide a framework for the whole paper, let consider a binary classifier C that aims at predicting student success at a course. C is trained on a dataset {X,Y}_{i=1}^{n} with n the number of unique students, X the attributes characterizing the students, and Y the binary target variable whose values yi can take 0 for failure and 1 for success. To apply the MADD, C should output both its predictions \u0176 and the predicted probability p\u1d62 associated to each prediction: C \u2192 {\u0177\u1d62 = {0,1}, p\u1d62 \u2208 [0,1]}. In the rest of the paper, we will focus on the probability related to the success prediction for every student i, i.e. p\u1d62(\u0177\u1d62 = 1), but as it is also equal to 1 - p\u1d62(\u0177\u1d62 = 0), it is simpler to use the notation p\u1d62 indifferently.\nLet also consider one attribute of X, simply noted as a (instead of x^(a) conventionally), which will be our attribute of interest, that is to say the attribute regarding which we will evaluate algorithmic fairness. This attribute a should be binary, i.e. composed of two distinct groups of students, G\u2080 and G\u2081. As an example, if a corresponds to having declared a disability, a student could not belong to the group of those who have not (e.g. G\u2080) and the group of those who have (e.g. G\u2081) declared a disability."}, {"title": "2.3 Definition", "content": "To introduce the metric, the Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD) [9] relies on the comparison between how a model C distributes its probabilities of success predictions p\u1d62 between the students of a group G\u2080 and those of a group G\u2081 from an attribute a. To do so, the calculation of the metric needs two one-dimensional vectors of the same length, noted D^G\u2080 and D^G\u2081, and called density vectors. They both contain the proportions of students of G\u2080 and G\u2081 respectively who receive the same predicted probabilities p\u1d62 (see Figures 1a and 1b). These proportions are noted d^G\u2080,k and d^G\u2081,k with k the index of the distinct value of p\u1d62. The MADD is thus defined as follows [9]:\nMADD (D^G\u2080, D^G\u2081) = \u2211_{k=0}^{m}|d^G\u2080,k - d^G\u2081k| \u2208 [0,2]  (1)\nTo better understand what the MADD represents, a visual approximation is given in Figure 1c through the red zone, i.e. the zone where the two continuous density estimates (represented by continuous curves) of discrete D^G\u2080,k and D^G\u2081k do not intersect. We highlight one advantage of the MADD that is to be bounded, making it objective and comparable for any data-models applications. Indeed, it is bounded between 0 and 2, and the closer the MADD is to 0, the fairer the outcome of the model is (regarding the two groups). More precisely, in the case where the MADD is equal to 0, the model produces the same probability outcomes for both groups so that D^G\u2080 = D^G\u2081 and MADD(D^G\u2080, D^G\u2081) = 0. Conversely, in the most unfair case, where the model produces totally distinct probability outcomes for both groups, the MADD is equal to 2 because we directly sum over the total proportion of both groups, that is to say 1 and 1. This"}, {"title": "3 The MADD Post-Processing Approach", "content": "will give some intuition about how to improve fairness based on the MADD in the next section."}, {"title": "3.1 Purpose", "content": "As introduced in the previous section, the closer the MADD is to 0, the fairer the outcome of the model is (w.r.t to attribute a), since the distributions of predicted probabilities are no longer distinguishable between the two groups G\u2080 and G\u2081. Thus, to illustrate how a post-processing with the MADD would work, let consider that a model tends to give higher predicted probabilities (i.e. probabilities of success predictions) to a group, e.g. G\u2080, than to the other, as shown in Figure 2a. Therefore, the goal of the MADD post-processing is to reduce the"}, {"title": "3.2 Approach", "content": "Following up on the previous part, a question can be raised: where should the two distributions coincide? Indeed, should the distribution of G\u2081 move to the one of G\u2080 or is there a better location between the two? To solve this issue, let first note as D the distribution related to all students, composed of students from both groups G\u2080 and G\u2081 (see the black histogram in Figure 3a). In machine learning, the goal for a model is to approximate the \"true\" relationship (or prediction function X \u2192 Y) between the attributes X in input and the target variable Y in output. As a consequence, we assume that a model that shows satisfying predictive performance outputs a discrete distribution D which should be really close to D, its \"true\" distribution (see the black line in Figure 3a). Therefore, assuming having such a model, our goal is to make the distributions D^G\u2080 and D^G\u2081, coincide at the place of D, which should best approximate D (see proofs in Appendix A). Indeed, this allows both to reduce the gaps between the two groups hence improve fairness and to prevent a loss in predictive performance. Therefore, the MADD post-processing is based on the following theoretical considerations.\nSince D, D^G\u2080 and D^G\u2081 correspond to histograms, then they can be mathematically considered as discrete estimators of the \"true\" probability density functions (PDFs) they describe (see Figure 3b) [3], noted as f, f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081) respectively in the following. We thus want f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081) to move towards the target f, as the intuition was given in the previous paragraph, but in a linear way because we want to keep the proportionality of their relative distance (see Figure 3c), otherwise it will improve fairness more for one group than for the other. We can now define the new theoretical PDFs f, f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081) that we will estimate after the post-processing, by introducing a \u03bb parameter, that we call fairness coefficient of distributions convergence, such that:\nf^(G\u2080) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb) f^(G\u2080) + \u03bbf  (2)\nf^(G\u2081) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb) f^(G\u2081) + \u03bbf  (3)\n\u03bb can be seen as a distance ratio (see Figure 3c) so that \u03bb\u2208 [0,1], with \u03bb = 0 when the PDFs of G\u2080 and G\u2081 are at their initial state and \u03bb = 1 when they both coincide. A between 0 and 1 means that the distributions are getting closer (see discrete examples of distribution convergence in Figure 5). The challenge is to find the highest \u03bb possible that best improves the fairness without affecting the accuracy of the results. However, in practice, as we do not know the true f, f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081), we cannot directly compute f, f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081) as written in equations 2 and 3 with different values of \u03bb. That is why we introduce fip in the next part."}, {"title": "3.3 Implementation", "content": "We will generate a mapping function\u00b9, fairness_improved_prediction or in short fip, between the discrete estimates of f, f^(G\u2080), f^(G\u2081) (i.e. D, D^G\u2080, D^G\u2081) and the discrete estimates of f, f^(G\u2080), f^(G\u2081) that we will note as D^(\u03bb), D^(\u03bb)_G\u2080, D^(\u03bb)_G\u2081. The purpose of fip is more precisely to take as inputs the p\u1d62 available at the output of a trained model and a value of \u03bb, and to output the new fairer predicted probabilities that we note as p\u1d62^(\u03bb) (fip: (p\u1d62, \u03bb) \u2194 p\u1d62^(\u03bb)). Consequently, p\u1d62^(\u03bb) will allow to reconstruct the new D^(\u03bb)_G\u2080 and D^(\u03bb)_G\u2081, as shown in Figure 2b.\nfip will be generated as follows. Let focus on the group G\u2080 first. As we want the proportions of students having the same predicted probabilities to be kept even if the predicted probabilities values are changing with the post-processing, we will seek to make the cumulative density function (CDF) of the initial p\u1d62 of group G\u2080 being equal to the CDF of the new p\u1d62^(\u03bb) of group G\u2080. Thus, it comes that:\nCDF^(Go)(p_{i(G_0)}) = CDF^{(\u03bb)}_{Go}(p_{i(G_0)}^{(\u03bb)} (4)\np_{i(G_0)}^{(\u03bb)} = CDF^{(\u03bb)-1}_{Go}(CDF^{Go}(p_{i(G_0)})) (5)\nwhere CDF^(\u03bb)_{G_0}(CDF(G_0)) = (1-\u03bb) CDF^{Go} +\u03bbCDF, and CDF^(\u03bb)-1_{Go} is the general inverse function of CDF^(\u03bb)_{Go}. We will have the same equations for the group G\u2081. In the end, what we do is to compute the different CDFs and CDF^{-1}s thanks to interp1d and cumtrapz Python functions from scipy library that estimate their \"true\" equivalents based on the discrete values of p\u1d62 we have access to, which gives us the core of our fip mapping function. Now we have the ability to compute the p\u1d62^(\u03bb), let define an objective function based both on the accuracy and the fairness of the new fairer predicted probability results which depend on \u03bb, to evaluate the outcome of our MADD post-processing method."}, {"title": "3.4 Objective Function", "content": "Similarly to existing balancing methods between accuracy and penalty values, we define the objective function as follows:\nL = (1 - \u03b8) AccuracyLoss(\u03bb) + \u03b8 FairnessLoss(\u03bb)  (6)\nwhere \u03b8\u2208 [0, 1] represents the importance of the accuracy and the fairness in the objective function. Indeed, a larger \u03b8 puts more emphasis on fairness, while a smaller \u03b8 favors accuracy. The value of \u03b8 could be set by an expert depending of what one wants to put more emphasis on, or experimentally determined like what we do with \u03bb in part 5.1 for instance. The AccuracyLoss(\u03bb), compatible with any common loss functions l (e.g. binary cross-entropy loss), and the FairnessLoss(\u03bb) could be defined as follows:\nAccuracyLoss(\u03bb) = 1/n \u03a3_{i=1}^{n} l(p_{i}^{(\u03bb)}, y_{i})  (7)\nFairnessLoss(\u03bb) = MADD (D^G\u2080, D^G\u2081)  (8)\nSince the two losses may vary across different scales of values, one should pay particular attention to the choice of l and the way of rescaling both losses to balance them effectively. We will show an example in part 4.2."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": "Our MADD post-processing method, illustrated in Figure 4, can be applied for a fixed \u03b8 as follows.

Next, we apply our fip mapping function with various values of \u03bb to obtain different corresponding p_{i,validation}^{(\u03bb)}. We will thus deduce the new \u0177_{i,validation}^{(\u03bb)} thanks to the classification threshold t. Now, with the new p_{i,validation}^{(\u03bb)}, \u0177_{i,validation}^{(\u03bb)} and the true labels y_{i,validation}, we can plot the results of our objective function depending on the \u03bbs to find the optimal \u03bb* that will best improve the results of the classifier.

Both losses have thus a range of [0, 100%]. Indeed, the AccuracyLossexp(\u03bb) is the percentage of incorrect predictions, and the FairnessLossexp(\u03bb) now represents a percentage of dissimilarity between the two distributions. Therefore, the resulting objective function Lexp is a weighted average of these two losses based on their importance. However, as a case study, we choose to give in all our experiments the same importance both to the accuracy and the fairness in the post-processing and we fix \u03b8 = 0.5. Additionally, it is important to note that in the case of this AccuracyLossexp(\u03bb), it exactly corresponds to 1 minus the standard accuracy score, which we will exploit in our results in section 5.

Let p_{i(G_0)} and p_{i(G_1)} be represented by some respective PDFs f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081). f^(G\u2080) and f^(G\u2081) are respectively parts of the gamma distribution \u0393(4, 1) and the normal distribution N(0.55, 1), properly scaled along the x-axis and normalized within the interval [0, 1]:\nf^(Go) (x) := 1/C\u2080 f_{\u0393(4,1)} (11x)1_{[0,1]}(x) C\u2080 := \u222b\u2080\u00b9 f_{\u0393(4,1)}(11x)dx\nf^(G1)(x) := 1/C\u2081 f_{N(0.55,1)} (10x)1_{[0,1]}(x) C\u2081 := \u222b\u2080\u00b9 f_{N(0.55,1)}(10x)dx\nBased on the above PDFs, we generate 10,000 samples of p_{i(G_0)} and 10,000 samples of p_{i(G_1)}, whose density vectors D^G\u2080 and D^G\u2081 are displayed in Figure 6a. Moreover, to simulate the true label y\u1d62 for each student i, we arbitrarily choose to pass the simulated p\u1d62 value as a parameter of a Bernoulli law: Bernoulli(p\u1d62) \u2208 {0,1}. This will enable us to simulate how a classifier would perform before the post-processing, to compare its results with those obtained after the post-processing.

Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An expert interview was also conducted to identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to benefit traffic safety and efficiency (Greenblatt & Shaheen, 2015; Jamson et al., 2011; Talebpour & Mahmassani, 2016; Yaqoob et al., 2020). Although steady development of higher levels of AVs is gradually witnessed, their deployment will not happen overnight. Instead, a transition period is inevitable, during which AVs with various automation levels will share the same road environment with human drivers, leading to mixed traffic conditions.\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) defines six levels of driving automation (SAE International, 2021) ranging from No Driving Automation (Level 0) to Full Driving Automation (Level 5). Level 0 has no automation, and the driver is fully responsible for all aspects of driving. Levels 1 and 2 introduce partial automation, where the driver remains responsible for driving, even with the assistance of automated features, and must supervise these features continuously. The difference between Levels 1 and 2 lies in the scope of control supported: Level 1 supports either steering or brake/acceleration, while Level 2 supports both simultaneously, encompassing longitudinal and lateral control. At levels 3, 4, and 5 the automated system monitors the environment with full automation capabilities when the automated driving (AD) features are engaged. However, distinctions exist among these levels. At Level 3, known as conditional automation, drivers must be prepared to intervene and resume control when prompted by the AD features. While at Levels 4 and Level 5, the AD features will never make such requests. For Level 4, the AD features can operate the vehicle only under specific conditions defined by the Operational Design Domain (ODD). In contrast, Level 5 allows the AD features to operate the vehicle under all conditions.\n\nThe deployment of AVs in mixed traffic introduces new challenges and novel interactions which may introduce uncertainties and issues that affect both road safety and efficiency (Fagnant & Kockelman, 2015; Farah et al., 2022; Fraedrich et al., 2015; Raju et al., 2022). Moreover, there is a pressing need to ensure the acceptance of AVs by human drivers to seamlessly integrate them into existing traffic systems (\u0141ach & Svyetlichnyy, 2024; Orieno et al., 2024).\n\nRegarding the development of AVs' driving behaviors, previous studies have traditionally prioritized aspects such as safety, efficiency, comfort, and energy consumption (Du et al., 2022; ElSamadisy et al., 2024; Vasile et al., 2023; M. Zhu et al., 2020). While these elements are essential, the growing complexity of mixed traffic environments\u2014where AVs must coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs)-highlights the importance of ensuring that AVs' driving behaviors are socially compliant. Referring and upgrading upon the definition provided in (Schwarting et al., 2019), socially compliant driving of AVs can be defined as behaving predictably and complying with the social expectations of human drivers and other surrounding road users (including other AVs) when encountering social dilemmas during driving with intensive interactions (e.g., driving through unsignalized intersections, roundabouts, on-ramp/off-ramp merging, or unprotected left turning). This encompasses compliance with different local driving cultures, norms, cues, formal and informal traffic rules, and behaviors expected in specific contexts. The capability of AVs to drive in a predictable and socially compliant way is critical not only for enhancing safety and efficiency but also for fostering understanding and acceptance of AVs by human drivers. Consequently, there is a growing interest in designing and developing socially compliant automated driving systems. AVs with socially compliant driving capabilities, i.e., socially compliant AVs (SCAVs), generally correspond to Level 3 to Level 5 automation. While infrequent, certain aspects of socially compliant driving might also be observed at Level 2 or Level 1 automation, where partial driver assistance needs to be provided when requested. Nevertheless, the full potential of socially compliant AVs is most relevant and impactful at higher levels of automation, where AVs are expected to make independent decisions in complex traffic scenarios.\n\nSome preliminary efforts have been made in the domain of socially compliant driving, e.g., (Hang et al., 2021; Kolekar et al., 2020; Schwarting et al., 2019; W. Wang et al., 2022). These studies have laid important groundwork by exploring various aspects of social compliance of AVs, including modeling social interactions, understanding the dynamics between HDVs and AVs, and developing models for socially aware perception, decision-making, or trajectory planning. However, despite these advancements, research on this emerging topic remains relatively limited, particularly in areas such as the modeling of different driving norms and implicit communication in different cultural backgrounds. The current studies lack a comprehensive, integrated approach that fully addresses the complexities, multidisciplinary, and multifaceted nature of socially compliant driving. Therefore, there is a clear and pressing need for the development of an integrated conceptual framework that can guide future research, providing a holistic understanding of socially compliant driving and helping to design a research agenda to bridge the gaps in the current literature.\n\nTo advance research in the domain of SCAVs, this study embarks on a comprehensive approach employing an integrated research method. It begins with a scoping review of the current state of the art, aimed at identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. Additionally, an informal expert interview was conducted to gather insights into critical issues and research expectations towards socially complaint AVs. Subsequently, leveraging the findings from the scoping review and expert interview, a conceptual framework is proposed. This framework incorporates all aspects deemed necessary, based on the scoping review and expert interviews, for the development of SCAVs. To validate and refine the proposed conceptual framework as well as gain further insights, an online survey was developed and responses from experts worldwide were collected. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the framework for developing SCAVs to safely and efficiently integrate them into mixed traffic environments.

Scoping Literature Review", "content": "In this study, a scoping review is adopted to synthesize the current research evidence and state of the practice in scientific peer-reviewed publications, as well as identify the key concepts, predominant research approaches, and research gaps related to SCAVs.\n\nA scoping review was selected over a systematic review due to the exploratory nature of the research objective. Compared to systematic reviews which aim to provide a synthesis and critical appraisal of the published evidence (Munn et al., 2018), scoping reviews are more suitable to summarize and report the research evidence on emerging and burgeoning topics, where evidence is limited and not yet systematically consolidated. As outlined in (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005; Tafidis et al., 2022), scoping reviews aim to provide a broad overview of available research, identifying relevant key concepts, methodologies, and gaps that require further investigation. Considering that AVs, especially SCAVs, are still in the early stages of development, with a relatively small body of research, a scoping review approach is more appropriate for mapping the current state of the field.\n\nThe scope of the review specifically targets methodologies and technical developments (i.e., the methods, algorithms, platforms, tools, and datasets that have been employed), as well as the substantive content of reviewed studies (e.g., what has been done, what scenarios/maneuvers have been covered), that are relevant to SCAVs. This focus aligns with the study's goal of proposing a conceptual framework to guide future research and development. The descriptive nature of the scoping review allows for an expansive exploration of the research landscape, offering a foundation for conceptualizing SCAVs in the context of mixed-traffic environments. It is important to note that detailed analyses and discussions of the findings and conclusions from the reviewed studies are beyond the scope of this study, as the primary focus is on synthesizing key methodological insights to inform the proposed framework."}, {"title": "2.1 Five-step approach", "content": "In this study, a five-step scoping review was utilized to identify and report related existing literature and map the results.

In principle, only peer-reviewed research papers published in journals and conference proceedings in English up till May 21, 2024, were considered eligible for the scoping review. It is essential that the pertinent studies involve the social interactions between AVs and HDVs, as well as between AVs and other road users (e.g., cyclists, and pedestrians). Publications solely discussing and modeling the social interactions and behaviors among humans (e.g., drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians) without insights into SCAVs are deemed ineligible and thus excluded from the review process. There have been a few review papers including such publications, e.g., (Crosato, Tian, et al., 2023; W. Wang et al., 2022). Therefore, the main difference and key contribution of the literature review part in this study lie in its dedicated focus on socially compliant driving, specifically emphasizing interactions involving AVs or insights toward this goal as a core criterion."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Step 2: Developing search strategy and process", "content": "In this step, a systematic search strategy is developed to identify relevant studies for inclusion in the scoping review. The search strategy encompasses a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary terms related to socially compliant automated driving, social-aware automated driving, social interaction, automated driving, and other associated concepts.

Subsequently, the full-text articles of the identified studies undergo a thorough review to assess their eligibility. Only studies that are deemed truly pertinent to the research objectives are selected for inclusion in the scoping review.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure the comprehensiveness of the literature coverage, a backward and forward snowballing technique was employed.

Keyword network analysis provides insights into the interconnectedness of key terms and concepts within the literature, highlighting prominent themes and areas of focus. By analyzing the co-occurrence and relationships between keywords, researchers can identify clusters of related concepts and uncover overarching themes. The Sankey diagram visualization offers a graphical representation of the flow of information between different categories or variables, illustrating the distribution and relationships between various elements in the selected studies and providing a holistic view of the research landscape. By visualizing the flow of information, researchers can identify patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent from textual analysis alone.\n\nBy leveraging these visualization techniques, the findings of the scoping review are presented in a clear and concise manner, enabling stakeholders to easily interpret and understand the key findings and insights derived from the selected studies. Additionally, visualizing the data enhances the accessibility and communicability of the research findings, and facilitates knowledge dissemination.

The AV learns to mimic human-like decision-making and driving patterns by observing and imitating from either expert demonstrations or processed empirical real-world driving data. This method can work in an end-to-end pipeline but is not necessary. Representative works in this direction include (Da & Hua, 2023; Sun et al., 2019; Z. Wang et al., 2021; C.

This method enables AVs to learn and adapt the"}, {"title": "(3) Model-Based Generation of Human-Like Behaviors", "content": "This category encompasses approaches that leverage mathematical models to replicate human driving behaviors and/or inform socially aware decision-making. Techniques within this category, such as game theory, social force models, driving risk field models, and potential field models, simulate the complex interaction dynamics between AVs and other road users, including HDVs, pedestrians, and cyclists. Game theory, in particular, provides a framework for strategic decision-making by modeling interactions as a series of cooperative or competitive scenarios where AVs make decisions based on anticipated responses from surrounding agents (Hang et al., 2021; Hang, Lv, et al., 2022; Shu et al., 2023). Other models, like the social force model, e.g., in (Chen et al., 2024; Reddy et al., 2021; Yoon & Ayalew, 2019), driving risk field model, e.g., in (Geng et al., 2023; Kolekar et al., 2020; J. Wang et al., 2023), and potential field model,e.g., in (Bhatt et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2024), capture the forces, risks, and potential outcomes of interactions in mixed-traffic environments, allowing for a more nuanced emulation of human-like behaviors. These model-based approaches are valuable for predicting and generating socially compliant driving behaviors by considering both explicit rules and inferred human tendencies. Notable contributions in this area include, e.g., (Bhatt et al., 2022; Ferrer & Sanfeliu, 2014; Hang et al., 2021; Hang, Lv, Huang, Xing, et al., 2020; Kolekar et al., 2020; A. Li et al., 2023; J. Liu, Qi, et al., 2024; Shu et al., 2023; J. Wang et al., 2023).\n\nIt can be noted that, usually, these models can be integrated with learning-based approaches (especially RL) to enhance their adaptability and responsiveness in real-time applications, as seen in works like (J.

Unlike categories (1) and (2), which generally deliver driving control actions, the approaches here rely on deep learning (DL) using deep neural networks (DNNs) or IRL aided by social factor models to analyze and learn from large datasets and forecast the socially compliant trajectories of surrounding HDVs, pedestrians, and/or other road users. By accurately predicting these trajectories, the ego AV can then adjust its actions to achieve corresponding socially compliant driving behavior, thus ensuring smoother and safer interactions in mixed-traffic scenarios (Geng et al., 2023; Vemula et al., 2018; Yoon & Ayalew, 2019). The prediction can then be used for RL control (Valiente et al., 2024) to leverage prediction and social awareness in RL decision-making, to improve safety and efficiency."}, {"title": "(5) Optimization-Based Tuning of Social Driving Parameters", "content": "This approach leverages optimization techniques to fine-tune the parameters of driving models to achieve desired social objectives, such as individualistic, altruistic, or pro-social driving behavior.

Representative studies in this category include, e.g., (Larsson et al., 2021).\n\nThese aforementioned methodologies collectively represent the current state of research in socially compliant driving behavior for AVs. They highlight the multidisciplinary nature of the field, which combines elements of artificial intelligence (AI) (e.g., ML, DL, RL), physics, human factors, control theory, social psychology, and transportation engineering. The integration of multidisciplinary knowledge is crucial for developing AVs capable of safely and efficiently interacting with HDVs and other road users in complex traffic environments.

This ensured that the conversations were well-informed. The discussions were open-ended, allowing participants to elaborate on their views on the current limitations of AVs and provide in-depth observations on the challenges and opportunities in this field.

Given the importance of this in real-world deployment, it warrants more in-depth exploration.\n\u2022 Cultural and Normative Adaptation: As limited research and development have incorporated cultural differences, driving norms, and implicit cues into automated driving models, this area deserves more attention.\n\u2022 Development of AV Communication Pipelines: There is a pressing need for AVs to express their intentions to other road users using e.g., external human-machine interfaces (eHMI) such as color-changing surfaces, signal lights, or LED panels on AVs.\n\u2022 AV-Human Mutual Behavioral Adaptation: The long-term and short-term adaptation of human drivers' behavior when interacting with AVs and the corresponding adjustments AVs should make in response to those adaptations are seldom accounted for in the current development of AV driving models.\n\u2022 Network-wide and Societal Benefits: Few studies have considered the broader implications for overall network efficiency and societal benefits (e.g., total emissions across road networks) when deploying different AV driving strategies, styles, and behaviors.\n\u2022 Interdisciplinary efforts: Most research combines approaches from computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering. Emerging efforts involving social psychology focus on adding concepts like SVO, coordination tendencies, and courtesy. More advanced frameworks incorporating social psychology and other interdisciplinary fields are needed to deepen the understanding of human-AV interactions.\n\nThese insights were the basis for the conceptual framework in the following Section 3.2 to guide future research and development efforts in this area."}, {"title": "3.2 Proposed Conceptual Framework", "content": "Incorporating insights from the scoping review and addressing the identified gaps and research expectations from both the literature review and the expert interview, a conceptual framework, as illustrated in Figure 5, is proposed to guide future research and development on SCAVs.\n\nOverall, this framework follows the standard modular design for developing AVs, which includes sensing and perception modules, decision-making modules, planning modules, and control action modules. The differences and added values of the proposed conceptual framework are as follows:\n\na) Socially-Compliant Decision-Making Module: The traditional decision-making module is enhanced and transformed into the proposed socially-compliant decision-making module. This modification integrates social components (including culture, norms, and cues), which may influence implicit interactions, and consideration for various driving styles (e.g., aggressive, cautious, pro-social). The integration and embedding of these elements will help to address the aforementioned limitations of Cultural and Normative Inflexibility and Challenges in Adapting to Various Driving Styles. Furthermore, the module incorporates mechanisms for bidirectional behavioral adaptation, enabling AVs to respond to human drivers' behavioral cues and adjust their responses accordingly, which will be illustrated later.\nb) Safety Constraint Module: This module continuously monitors and enforces safety constraints to ensure that AVs operate within predefined safety boundaries. Although the socially compliant decision-making module should already incorporate safety metrics, the dedicated safety constraint module serves as a critical safeguard, ensuring that all actions taken by the AV are within the safety limits, thereby preventing undesirable outcomes. The planning module in this framework encompasses both high-level path planning and behavior planning (e.g., lane changes, merging) as well as low-level motion planning (e.g., longitudinal and angular velocity, acceleration), all of which must adhere to the safety constraints outlined by this module.\nc) Trade-off between Ego and Network-Level Benefits: A fundamental challenge (which is currently missing) in AV development is balancing the individual benefits of the ego vehicle (such as safety, comfort, and efficiency) with the broader benefits to the road network and other road users. The proposed framework emphasizes the necessity of managing this trade-off, acknowledging that optimal performance for individual vehicles should not come at the expense of the overall network efficiency or societal benefits. It is suggested that this trade-off should be managed dynamically, on a case-by-case basis, to ensure a balanced approach that maximizes both individual and collective outcomes (i.e., a more holistic, systems-level perspective). This requires close collaboration between AV developers, road operators, and regulatory authorities to align objectives and responsibilities. By managing the trade-off adaptively, this module will help meet the aforementioned expectation regarding Network-wide and Societal Benefits.\nd) Bidirectional Behavioral Adaptation Module: A key novel contribution of the proposed framework is the introduction of a bidirectional behavioral adaptation module. This module addresses the phenomenon where human drivers adapt their behavior in response to the presence and actions of AVs in mixed traffic. For instance, drivers may exploit the defensive behavior of AVs by engaging in more aggressive driving when interacting with them. To mitigate this, the AVs must adapt their behaviors in return, effectively responding to changes in human driving patterns and fostering a more balanced and cooperative interaction. The module is designed to facilitate a dynamic, iterative process of mutual adaptation, wherein both AVs and human drivers adjust their actions to optimize safety, traffic flow, and overall road network efficiency in mixed traffic conditions. For successful real-world deployment, it is essential that the bidirectional behavioral adaptation module undergoes continuous updates, both in the short-term and long-term, to account for evolving traffic conditions and varied human driving behaviors. This ensures that the module remains responsive to a wide array of scenarios, thereby supporting the integration of AVs into diverse traffic contexts. This module will help to alleviate the aforementioned limitations of Excessive Conservatism and Challenges in Adapting to Various Driving Styles and help to meet the expectations of AV-Human Mutual Behavioral Adaptation.\ne) Spatial-Temporal Memory Module: The spatial-temporal memory module is designed to facilitate the long- and short-term updating of knowledge and driving rules, as well as to enhance the awareness of ongoing behavioral adaptations. This module enables AVs to incorporate historical interaction data and adapt their decision-making strategies over time. By maintaining a dynamic memory of past interactions, AVs can continuously refine their understanding of human-AV dynamics, ensuring that driving strategies incorporate lessons learned from prior experiences. This module is essential for the effective integration and implementation of bidirectional behavioral adaptation within the broader AV decision-making framework.\nExplanations regarding the other remaining limitations, gaps, and expectations are presented in Section 3.1:\n\nThe limitation of Limited Scenario Anticipation will be tackled by the sensing and perception module and the eHMI which connect the sensing and perception module to the element of Implicit Interactions in the socially compliant decision-making module (shown in blue texts and dashed arrows in Figure 5), Furthermore, an advanced and powerful sensor and perception module that is accurate, robust, and capable of handling sensing failure and uncertainties is vital for filling the gap of Integration of Sensing and Planning & Control. It is important to note that the development of advanced sensing and perception techniques remains a broader area of study and falls outside the scope of this research.\n\nThe Inability to Interpret Implicit Communications can be alleviated through the proposed eHMI which allows AVs to convey their intentions more effectively. The eHMI will also help with the"}, {"title": "4.

These findings underscore the diverse expertise and perspectives that the respondents bring to the survey, enhancing the credibility of the survey results."}, {"title": "4.2 Benefits of SCAVs and willingness to purchase or use", "content": "Regarding the benefits of SCAVs, participants were asked to rate to what extent they think SCAVs will influence overall traffic safety and efficiency. The rating is based on a 7-point Likert scale with \"-3\" meaning strongly worsen; \u201c0\u201d standing for neutral/no influence; and \u201c3\u201d indicating strongly improve. As demonstrated in Figure 7, the majority of respondents believe that SCAVs contribute positively to both overall traffic safety and efficiency. The average rating for the potential improvement in safety is 1.04, while the average rating for efficiency is 0.54. These figures indicate that, on average, respondents perceive SCAVs as having a greater potential to enhance safety than to improve efficiency, but both are seen as contributing positively.\n\nCorrespondingly, when participants were asked about their willingness to purchase SCAVs when considering a vehicle purchase"}]}

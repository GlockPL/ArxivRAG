INTRODUCTION", "content": "Facial parsing-the segmentation of fine-grained facial components such as eyes, nose, mouth, and hair is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting applications in face recognition [34], augmented reality [17], and facial expression analysis [5]. Recent advances in deep learn-ing have significantly improved segmentation accuracy [3], [18], yet existing models primarily optimize for benchmark performance while often neglecting key concerns such as: (1) fairness across demographic groups, (2) robustness to noise, occlusions, and domain shifts, and (3) the impact of segmentation on downstream generative models. While face parsers may perform well on clean, well-represented data, they often degrade sharply for underrepresented demograph-ics [2], [11], [25] or in challenging real-world conditions [9], [8], [12]. Such biases and fragility not only reduce trust and usability in applications like identity verification and facial editing but also propagate into generative synthesis, amplifying disparities in downstream tasks.\nRecent efforts have explored multi-objective optimization for general segmentation [15], [30], [28] and fairness-aware approaches in facial analysis [21], [24]. However, a unified strategy that jointly optimizes accuracy, fairness, and robust-ness in face parsing remains underexplored. Furthermore, integrating fair and robust segmentation with generative models introduces additional complexities: state-of-the-art GAN-based [10] and diffusion-based models [39] rely on semantically structured segmentation maps [26], [35] to generate realistic and controllable faces. If the segmentation model introduces bias or lacks robustness, these deficiencies are propagated and often amplified-by generative models, leading to unnatural or demographically skewed outputs [20], [32], [7]. This issue is particularly pronounced in GAN-based synthesis, where segmentation errors cause unnatural facial reconstructions, and in diffusion-based models such as ControlNet, where inaccurate parsing reduces semantic alignment and editability.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a homotopy-based multi-objective learning framework for face parsing that explicitly balances accuracy, fairness, and robustness. Our method dynamically adjusts training objectives over time, shifting from an accuracy-first paradigm in early training to a balanced trade-off incorporating fairness and robustness. This approach enables stronger segmentation performance across diverse demographic groups while im-proving resilience to occlusions, noise, and domain shifts. Unlike prior works that optimize for fairness or robustness in isolation, our framework unifies these perspectives within a single pipeline and systematically evaluates their impact on generative face synthesis.\nTo validate our approach, we integrate multi-objective and single-objective U-Net models into a GAN-based face synthesis pipeline (Pix2PixHD) and assess their im-pact on generative quality. We further conduct prelimi-nary experiments with ControlNet, a structured diffu-sion model, to examine how segmentation quality affects guided image generation. Our evaluations span real-world perturbations\u2014including Gaussian noise, occlusions, blur, and lighting shifts as well as multiple demographic groups, measuring both segmentation performance (mIoU, fairness variance) and generative quality (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), LPIPS similarity [38], [40]).

RELATED WORK", "content": "A. Multi-Objective Optimization in Computer Vision\nMulti-objective optimization is widely used in computer vision to balance competing objectives such as accuracy, efficiency, and robustness [29]. Traditional methods rely on fixed weighting schemes for loss functions, limiting adapt-ability across different tasks. More recent techniques, such as homotopy-based optimization, introduce dynamic weighting mechanisms that shift priorities during training [4]. These methods have shown promise in solving complex optimiza-tion problems, particularly in high-dimensional polynomial systems [23]. However, their application to specialized areas such as face parsing and generative modeling remains largely unexplored. Our work extends homotopy-based optimization to structured face parsing, explicitly integrating accuracy, fairness, and robustness into a single multi-objective frame-work.\nB. Generative Adversarial Networks and Multi-Objective Training\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used for tasks such as face generation, editing, and domain adaptation [10]. Unlike diffusion models, which rely on iterative denoising, GANs synthesize high-quality images in a single forward pass, making them efficient for appli-cations such as interactive facial editing [14]. GAN-based architectures provide structured control over facial attributes through techniques such as semantic segmentation-guided generation [26] and latent space manipulation [36].\nMulti-objective training of GANs has been explored through multi-discriminator architectures to improve sta-bility and diversity [1] and evolutionary optimization ap-proaches for adversarial training [33]. However, GANs re-main susceptible to mode collapse, demographic biases, and robustness issues, particularly when trained on imbal-anced datasets [32]. Our work introduces a homotopy-based optimization framework that explicitly balances perceptual realism, semantic alignment, and demographic fairness by leveraging segmentation maps as conditioning inputs. This allows us to systematically evaluate how fairness-aware pars-ing influences structured image synthesis. Additionally, we extend our analysis to diffusion-based synthesis (ControlNet), enabling a direct comparison between GANs and diffusion models in terms of controllability, fairness, and robustness."}, {"title": "C. Diffusion Models and Structured Conditioning", "content": "Diffusion models have emerged as powerful alternatives to GANs for high-resolution image generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in photorealistic synthesis [13]. Struc-tured conditioning mechanisms, such as ControlNet [39], im-prove controllability by integrating external control signals, including segmentation or edge maps. While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of diffusion models for face synthesis [27], their dependence on structured inputs has not been systematically examined in the context of fairness-aware segmentation pipelines. Our study investigates the role of multi-objective face parsing in guiding diffusion-based synthesis and compares its impact against traditional GAN-based conditioning.\nD. Fairness in Face Parsing and Generative Models\nFairness has been extensively studied in face recogni-tion and classification, where demographic biases in deep learning models have been well documented [2]. However, fairness-aware segmentation remains underexplored [11], de-spite evidence that segmentation models exhibit higher error rates for underrepresented demographic groups [6]. These disparities can propagate into downstream applications, such as attribute editing and face synthesis, amplifying biases in generative outputs.\nWhile existing work has introduced fairness-aware regu-larization for generative models [32], few studies explicitly examine how segmentation biases affect generative synthesis pipelines. Our approach addresses this gap by incorporating fairness as an explicit training objective in face parsing and evaluating its effect on both GAN- and diffusion-based synthesis. By demonstrating how fairness-aware segmenta-tion improves photorealism and demographic consistency, we establish a framework for more equitable face generation.\nE. Face Parsing for Generative Synthesis\nFace parsing, which involves segmenting facial compo-nents such as eyes, lips, and hair, plays a critical role in tasks like face editing, synthesis, and attribute manipulation [19]. Previous work has explored using segmentation maps to enhance GAN-based face editing [26]. For instance, regional GAN inversion techniques leverage parsing maps to enable fine-grained control over facial feature editing [37]. How-ever, existing methods prioritize accuracy without explicitly addressing fairness or robustness.\nOur framework extends face parsing for generative syn-thesis by integrating segmentation and GAN training into a unified multi-objective pipeline. Using homotopy-based optimization, we balance realism, semantic alignment, and fairness, ensuring that segmentation maps remain robust to variations in demographic attributes and imaging conditions.\nF. Robustness and Cross-Domain Generalization\nRobustness to noise, occlusion, and domain shifts re-mains a key challenge in vision models [8], [12]. While segmentation models are often evaluated under controlled"}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED METHOD", "content": "In this section, we introduce our homotopy-based multi-objective framework for face parsing and its integration with both GAN-based and diffusion-based face editing models. We outline the problem formulation, dataset preparation, model architecture, training strategy, and evaluation pipeline, emphasizing fairness, robustness, and semantic alignment.\nA. Problem Formulation\nWe define the dataset $X = \\{x\\}$, where each face image is paired with a segmentation mask $y_i \\in Y$, mapping to 19 facial components (e.g., hair, eyes, mouth). Demographic attributes are denoted as $a$ (e.g., Male, Young, WearingHat). Our objective is to train a segmentation function $f_\\theta()$ that predicts $\\hat{y_i}$ while optimizing for accuracy, fairness, and robustness. Accuracy is maximized by aligning $y_i$ with $\\hat{y_i}$ using Dice loss [31]. Fairness is enforced by minimizing variance $Var(mIoU_g)$ across demographic groups, ensuring equitable segmentation quality. Robustness is maintained by penalizing performance degradation (mIoU drop) under input perturbations such as noise and occlusion.\nB. Dataset Preparation\nWe employ the CelebAMask-HQ dataset [16], divided into training, validation, and test sets. Each image and mask"}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS & DISCUSSION", "content": "This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of our segmentation models and their impact on both face parsing and generative synthesis (GAN and diffusion-based). We compare single-objective and multi-objective training strate-gies across robustness, fairness, and perceptual quality.\nA. Segmentation Performance\nDespite dedicating training capacity to multiple compet-ing objectives (fairness and robustness) rather than solely optimizing for accuracy, the multi-objective models achieve segmentation performance that remains on par with or even surpasses the single-objective baseline (Table I). This suggests that our homotopy-based optimization effectively balances competing goals without significantly compromis-ing segmentation accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating fairness and robustness without sacrificing core performance."}, {"title": "V. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "Despite notable improvements in fairness, robustness, and segmentation quality, several challenges remain, presenting opportunities for further research. First, the CelebAMask-HQ dataset, while diverse, remains imbalanced across de-mographic groups, which may limit generalization. Address-ing this requires more strategic data augmentation, active reweighting, or leveraging larger, demographically-balanced datasets to further mitigate bias and enhance equitable per-formance. Second, our current framework treats GANs as passive consumers of segmentation maps. Incorporating bi-directional optimization, where segmentation feedback in-fluences GAN training, could improve both parsing fidelity and generative realism. Such an approach could be extended to diffusion models, where structured conditioning remains underexplored in fairness-aware synthesis.\nAdditionally, while our method is broadly applicable be-yond facial segmentation, extending it to domains such as medical imaging, autonomous perception, or video-based synthesis may require task-specific adaptations. Future re-search should explore domain-aware multi-objective formu-lations that account for context-specific biases and robustness challenges. Finally, while homotopy scheduling improves optimization efficiency, fairness-aware training introduces additional computational overhead due to subgroup evalu-ations. Exploring adaptive sampling strategies or efficient approximations could make large-scale deployments more"}, {"title": "ETHICAL IMPACT STATEMENT", "content": "Our research focuses on fairness-aware and robust face parsing for generative AI, addressing biases in segmentation models and their downstream impact on generative synthesis. While our work aims to mitigate demographic disparities and improve model resilience, we acknowledge potential ethical concerns related to dataset biases, misuse, and unintended societal impact.\nPotential Risks and Negative Impacts: Face parsing and generative models can be misused for unethical applications, such as surveillance, deepfake generation, or reinforcing demographic stereotypes. Despite our efforts to improve fairness, residual biases in datasets (e.g., CelebAMask-HQ) may persist, potentially leading to unequal model perfor-mance across demographic groups. Additionally, robustness improvements could inadvertently be leveraged to enhance adversarial facial synthesis, raising concerns about identity fraud.\nRisk-Mitigation Strategies: To mitigate these risks, we employ fairness-aware multi-objective training to reduce de-mographic disparities and systematically evaluate robustness against real-world perturbations. Our methodology priori-tizes transparency and reproducibility\u2014our dataset choices, fairness metrics, and evaluation protocols will be made publicly available to facilitate scrutiny and improvement. Furthermore, we emphasize ethical use cases, discouraging applications in deceptive or harmful generative AI practices.\nHuman Subject and Data Ethics: Our study does not involve human subjects or personally identifiable information (PII). The datasets used (CelebAMask-HQ) are publicly available, and we adhere to all ethical guidelines concerning their use. While we acknowledge that publicly available datasets can contain biases, our methodology explicitly ad-dresses this issue through fairness-aware training and demo-graphic evaluation.\nFuture Ethical Considerations: Future research should extend fairness-aware segmentation to more diverse and representative datasets, ensuring broader applicability and minimizing demographic bias. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaborations with ethicists, policymakers, and domain ex-perts will be crucial to guiding responsible deployment and regulation of AI-generated content.\nBy integrating fairness and robustness into face parsing, we aim to contribute to the development of ethical, bias-aware Al models that enhance inclusivity and reliability in computer vision applications."}]}

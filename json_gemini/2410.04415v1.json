We propose a novel framework that maps reasoning chains in embedding spaces to Hamiltonian systems, allowing us to leverage powerful analytical tools from classical physics. Our method defines a Hamiltonian function that balances the progression of reasoning (kinetic energy) against the relevance to the question at hand (potential energy). Using this framework, we analyze a large dataset of reasoning chains from a multi-hop question-answering task, revealing intriguing patterns that distinguish valid from invalid reasoning. We show that valid reasoning chains have lower Hamiltonian energy and move in ways that make the best trade-off between getting more information and answering the right question. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this framework to steer the creation of more efficient reasoning algorithms within AI systems.

One of the most important requirements is the interpretability and explainability of models . The difficulty in understanding the internal reasoning process of complex AI models, especially deep neural networks, limits their real assessment and the capability of generating human-understandable explanations for AI decisions and inferences . Ensuring that reasoning processes are robust to slight variations in input or context, and developing models that can generalize reasoning skills across different domains and types of questions is another key target we must address to improve the reasoning process . Without these efforts, we are struggling in identifying and mitigating biases in reasoning processes, ensuring fair reasoning across different demographic groups or topic areas . We have also some challenges in scaling up reasoning capabilities to handle increasingly complex and multi-step problems and integrating updated external knowledge . It is important to enhance thinking processes that can tackle partial or uncertain information. Addressing ambiguity in natural language questions and contexts will be decissive for improving the model's reasoning abilities, as will the development of new metrics that overcome existing ones' limits in capturing the nuances of complex reasoning. In seeking to develop autonomous co- workers using LLMs, we must confront the problems of temporal and causal thinking, particularly in the modeling and analysis of temporal sequences and causal relationships .

This magnitude likewise represents the \"distance\" between successive concepts in reasoning. Large magnitude values exhibit substantial leaps between divergent ideas, whereas small magnitude values show progressive progress between closely related ideas. Acceleration in reasoning represents the changes in velocity over time. An increase in acceleration suggests an intense rate of ideation or problem-solving, while a decrease in acceleration indicates a deliberate deceleration to concentrate on particular elements.\nIn the Frenet frame, the trajectory angle can be interpreted as the angle between the tangent vector T and a fixed reference direction (Figure 5). This angle changes as the curve evolves, reflecting changes in the direction of reasoning. The rate of change of this angle is directly related to the curvature \u03ba.

This connection between symmetry and conservation, first formalized by Emmy Noether in 1918 , reveals deep insights into the nature of invariance in physical and cognitive systems. Our analysis of reasoning trajectories through the lens of Hamiltonian mechanics and Lie group theory highlights how conserved quantities emerge from system symmetries . In classical physics, the invariance of physical laws under time translations leads to energy conservation, just as we find analogous conserved quantities in our reasoning space.\nA symmetry can be described as a transition that preserves certain properties of a system . In simple terms, consider rotating a perfect circle; it remains the same afterward. Mathematically, a group action on a set X is defined as a function\n$\\\u0424: G \u00d7 X \u2192 X$\nis a symmetry group if its group action preserves the structure on X, that is, leaves X invariant. For example, a square (X) has rotational symmetry (G) - it looks the same after rotating 90 degrees. But the concept of symmetry expanded beyond geometric shapes. It became about transformations that preserved particular properties, even in more complex abstract spaces like embedding spaces. Many natural laws are symmetrical. For example, the laws of physics apply the same sense regardless of where we are in space (implying translational symmetry), or the direction we take (rotational symmetry). A Lie group Gis a continuous transformation group that is also a differentiable manifold , with the group operations being differentiable maps. A symmetry S can be defined as\n$S(t) = exp(tXa)$\nwhere $S(t) \u2208 G, t\u2208 R$ Rand Xa is called generator. Lie groups give a language for describing and analyzing continuous symmetries with precision .\nNoether's Theorem defines an important connection between symmetries and conservation laws in physics. For any continuous symmetry in a physical system, there exists a corresponding conserved quantity that remains invariant across time. A symmetry is a transformation of a system that does not alter its general behavior. For instance, running an experiment today or tomorrow (temporal translation) will provide consistent physical laws. A conserved quantity is a property that remains unchanged while a system evolves. The invariance of physical theories about spatial and temporal transformations results in conservation laws, including the conservation of momentum and energy in the universe. Noether's theorem addresses the deep connection in nature: the symmetries observed in the world are closely linked to the conserved quantities in the transformation of physical systems. In other words, for each symmetry identified in an embedding space, there must be a corresponding conserved quantity in this space. The canonical transformations we applied to our reasoning trajectories, transforming from the original phase space to action-angle variables, unveil that while the \"energy\" (action) of reasoning processes tends to be conserved, the \"phase\" (angle) varies. This mirrors the behavior of classical mechanical systems and suggests that effective reasoning maintains a consistent level of complexity or engagement while exploring different cognitive directions. Our approach uses a Hamiltonian $H_R(q,p)$ for reasoning, where q represents the current state of reasoning and p the change in reasoning. This Hamiltonian system is analogous to those in classical mechanics, but is applied to abstract reasoning spaces.

For every fact and inquiry in a reasoning sequence, we derive a high- dimensional vector representation utilizing BERT's last hidden layer.

The distinct differentiation between valid and invalid chains can be seen in the energy charts shown in figure"}, {"title": "Effective discriminators of reasoning validity", "content": "The predominant reasoning chains , regardless of validity, cluster within an energy range of -9.5 to -9.0. This implies that most reasoning processes, whatever their level of validity, operate in a rather small energy range. The distinction in energy levels between valid and invalid chains appears ambiguous, which is remarkable and somewhat paradoxical. The prevalence of high-energy outliers predominantly within invalid chains may suggest that highly \"energetic\" or complex reasoning processes are more susceptible to errors or incorrect results. In contrast, extremely low-energy outliers, which are predominantly invalid, could indicate oversimplified or insufficient thinking. Notably, these significant energy states appear to be mostly linked to invalid chains. The generally stable energy band across chain indices indicates that the energy of a reasoning chain is not much influenced by its particular content or length, but rather by intrinsic characteristics of the reasoning process.\nThe Hamiltonian-inspired energy framework for analyzing reasoning chains reveals several key insights into cognitive processes . The energy distribution across chains exhibits a consistent pattern, suggesting a fundamental stability in reasoning regardless of content. A notable correlation emerges between kinetic and potential energy, indicating that as reasoning becomes more dynamic, it also tends to involve deeper or more complex concepts.\nValid reasoning chains generally demonstrate higher energy levels and more variability compared"}]}

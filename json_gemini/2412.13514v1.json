Rigid pedagogical methodology risks alienating learners whose tastes lie beyond\nthe confines of the selected curriculum, hindering engagement and enthusiasm. Advances in AI\nresearch can be used to offer transformative solutions in this regard \u2013 personalized music education\ntailored to each student's unique musical identity. By curating lessons around an individual's favorite\nartists, genres, and songs, we can create inclusive environments where students can fulfill their\nmusical potential.\n\nAl music generation has garnered significant attention and made immense progress in recent years [1,\n2, 3, 4]. We share the opinion that the practice of music is valuable far beyond just the final output\n[5, 6]. Using generative AI beyond music synthesis, towards analysis of musical concepts from audio\ndata to personalize and support music education remains an under-explored and exciting area for the\ncommunity.\n\nIn the following sections, we first explore the importance of leveraging students' individual musical\npreferences to enhance motivation and improve learning outcomes. We then present two case studies\nthat showcase the potential of AI-driven music technology in education. One is an ear training\napplication (app) that generates customized exercises based on students' favorite songs. The other is\nan AI-powered piano method book prototype that adapts to students' skill levels and musical interests."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Need for personalization\nConventional music curricula tend to prioritize mastery of Western classical music, folk traditions,\nand works of renowned composers. While this canonical approach provides a solid foundation, it\ncan fail to captivate students whose musical interests lie in contemporary, non-Western, or niche\ngenres [7]. The lack of representation of personal tastes in educational content can disengage learners,\nlimiting their motivation and ability to connect with the material [8]. As an example, a student drawn\ninto picking up the practice of music through their interest in electronic dance music may find it\nchallenging to engage with a curriculum focused on Baroque-era compositions [9].\n\nExtensive research highlights the benefits of personalized learning experiences [10]. Self determina-\ntion theory suggests that relatedness and autonomy are key components to sustain intrinsic motivation\nin the pursuit of achievement and performance [11]. Incorporating the student's preferred music and\ndesigning ways to interact with it can enhance agency and connection, supporting the educational\nendeavor [12, 13, 14].\n\nMoreover, the emotional resonance of music is thought to play a pivotal role in its educational efficacy\n[15]. Personalization in music education directly impacts skill acquisition, as engaged students are\nmore likely to practice consistently and persevere through challenges [16, 17].\n\nFor an individual student, the limitations of traditional music education can be circumvented by\nworking with an exceptional music teacher. Such teachers could incorporate the student's preferred\ngenres with a deep understanding those genres, and with the dedication to create a highly personalized\nlearning experience [18, 19, 20]. From the teacher's perspective, creating such experiences requires\nsubstantial time and effort towards transcribing songs, arranging them to suit the student's current\nskill level, and designing targeted exercises to develop specific abilities, such as ear training and\npiano technique. Tools can help ease this burden and enable better teaching of personalized content;\neven something as simple as automated harmonic analysis of symbolic music, like ChordNamer 1.\nGiven the demands on music teachers, this is uncommon and inaccessible to the majority of music\nstudents [21].\nAI powered solutions\nWe can build digital systems to serve as adaptive learning environments that cater to each student's\nunique musical interests and learning needs, at scale [22]. Through the analysis of audio tracks in\neach student's listening history, AI could enable creation of dynamic lesson plans and exercises\ntailored to individual interests as has been explored in language learning settings [23]. Moreover,\nthese adaptive learning systems could monitor student progress, adjusting the content and difficulty\nof lessons to maintain challenge and interest through the learning process.\n\nThe particular technologies we use for our case studies are Automatic Chord Recognition (ACR),\nbeat detection, and Automatic Music Transcription (AMT).\nAutomatic Chord Recognition (ACR) has evolved considerably from early knowledge-based systems\ntowards data-driven machine learning approaches [24]. Current tools like ChordAI 2, Chordify 3, and\nlibraries like crema 4, as well as data-sets like Chord-Annotations 5 are some of the resources that\nare available at present. Beat detection is often performed as a step on the way to chord recognition,\nalthough dedicated open-source tools such as BeatNet [25] also exist.\nAutomatic Music Transcription (AMT) is the process of converting audio recordings into symbolic\nmusical representations such as sheet music [26]. Researchers have explored options ranging from\nsignal processing techniques to machine learning algorithms [26] for AMT. In recent years, deep\nlearning models have demonstrated remarkable progress in accurately transcribing polyphonic music\n[27, 28, 29], and may soon be application-ready. Some of the main tools available at this time are"}, {"title": "3 Case Studies", "content": "We now explore how to build such systems through two case studies. In the first study we describe\nour ear training app, which generates custom exercises based on students' favorite songs. In the\nsecond case study we present an approach to create adaptive and personalized piano method books.\nEar Training App"}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "AI is poised to enable a paradigm shift in music education, away from rigid curricula prevalent in\ntraditional approaches towards those where personalization take center stage. In our opinion, the\nimpact of personalized approaches such as those showcased here for ear training and method books,\nextends far beyond simple convenience or novelty. By directly linking effort and practice to an\nimproved ability to understand, appreciate, and play the music the student loves, such applications\ncan support the learning process for skills that have much broader utility.\n\nAccess to skilled teachers is usually limited, and it tends to be expensive as well. Through applications\nlike ours, students can receive tailored instruction at a fraction of the cost of private lessons. However,\nwe'd like to note that AI-powered music education is not intended to replace human teachers. Rather,\nit can serve as a powerful tool to augment and enhance the work of music educators. Al systems can\nhandle the time-consuming tasks of content creation and adaptation, freeing up teachers to focus on\nhigher-level skills such as musical expression, creativity, and collaboration.\n\nWhile our case studies demonstrate the potential of AI-powered personalization in music education,\nwe acknowledge that comprehensive assessment of these approaches' effectiveness remains as future\nwork. Rigorous evaluation through controlled studies comparing traditional and AI-enhanced learning\nmethods, along with longitudinal studies tracking student progress and engagement over time, will be\ncrucial to validate these approaches.\n\nHere we have demonstrated an engaging ear training experience, and a conceptual approach to\ntailoring method books at various difficulty levels, both enabled by AI. These efforts are directed\ntowards lowering barriers, increasing personalization, and we present it with a hope that it inspires\nother attempts in music education."}, {"title": "B Limitations and Future Work", "content": "While this paper explores promising applications of AI in music education, it's important to acknowl-\nedge several limitations of our approach and the current state of technology:\n\nAccuracy of AI Models: Despite recent improvements, AI models make mistakes and lead to\nincorrect feedback or exercises.\n\nLimited Scope of Case Studies: Our case studies focus on ear training and piano education and\nother areas e.g. composition, music theory, other instruments, require further investigation.\n\nRole of Human Music Teachers: While AI-powered tools offer benefits, they cannot fully replicate\nthe nuanced guidance, emotional support, and real-time adaptability of human music teachers.\n\nCultural Bias: The AI models used in these applications are likely trained on datasets that may not\nrepresent the full diversity of global musical traditions.\n\nLimited Assessment: While we present promising applications, this work does not include com-\nprehensive assessment of their effectiveness. Controlled studies comparing these AI-enhanced\napproaches with traditional methods are needed. Additionally, while personalization can increase\nengagement, the long-term effects of these AI-powered approaches on music skill development and\nretention have not been thoroughly studied.

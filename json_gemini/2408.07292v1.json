However, analyzing and extracting insights from\nsuch data often requires specialized techniques. Traditional time series analysis methods heavily\nrely on domain-specific knowledge and feature engineering. Recent works explored recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNN) and convolution neural networks (CNN) for time series tasks, achieving promising\nresults. However, these require significant computational resources, can struggle with capturing\nlong-term dependencies, and aren't inherently suitable for self-supervised learning. On the other\nhand, transformer-based language models have recently shown outstanding performance in capturing\nlong-term dependency, self-supervised learning, and computational efficiency. Thus, there is a need\nto integrate language models for time series analysis via self-supervised learning.\nSelf-supervised representation can offer unique benefits over supervised learning. First, supervised\nlearning needs annotated data and is limited by the labeled data size and the quality of the label-\ning. Second, supervised models force a narrow learning of features for a single downstream task\nwhereas self-supervised features can achieve better generalization for many downstream applications.\nHowever, there are some unique challenges in self-supervised learning for the time series domain\ncompared to the natural language processing (NLP) of texts and similar transformer-based image\nmodels. This is mainly due to the fundamental difference in the nature of time series data, which are\ncontinuous-valued sequences, and text/images, which take discrete values from a finite vocabulary.\nTherefore, unlike NLP applications where word or sub-word tokens are used, there is no lexicon of\ndiscrete time series units, making it challenging to apply predictive losses in self-supervised learning.\nThis work proposes Linear Predictive Coding based Tokenizer for time series (LiPCoT), a novel\ntokenizer specifically designed to tokenize time series data for enabling self-supervised learning\nvia language models. In particular, LiPCoT transforms time series data into a sequence of tokens,\nallowing existing language models like BERT to be leveraged for self-supervised training leading to\ndownstream tasks like anomaly detection, forecasting, and classification.\nInstead of using CNN encoders which utilize temporal features, LiPCoT considers time series as a\nrealization from an underlying stationary stochastic random process and creates a latent space of\ntime series data using the parameters of the underlying random processes. This provides a stochastic\nrepresentation of time series data from which discrete tokens are constructed. By utilizing the\nstochastic representation of time series, LiPCoT offers some unique benefits over other methods. For\nexample, LiPCoT does not depend on the sampling frequency or length of the time series data which\nare crucial for other methods that utilize CNN encoders.\nIn this paper, we present a proof-of-concept study where we propose LiPCoT and demonstrate the\nefficacy of LiPCoT in classifying Parkinson's disease (PD) using EEG data from 46 participants. We\nutilize LiPCoT for tokenizing EEG signals which are then leveraged by BERT for self-supervised\nlearning and subsequent PD classification. We benchmark our approach against four state-of-the-art\ndeep learning architectures, and our findings show that BERT models utilizing self-supervised learning\non LiPCoT tokens outperform existing methods across all evaluated metrics for PD classification.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses prior time series tokenization\napproaches in the literature. Section 3 provides a detailed theory and methodology of LiPCoT. Section\n4 details our experiments for evaluating LiPCoT performance. The outcomes of our results are given\nin Section 5 and the ablation study is provided in Section 6.

The first one is Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) which utilizes traditional encoder-decoder VAE architecture based on CNN to learn a\ndiscrete codebook via vector quantization technique. This approach has been utilized for time series\nencoding in various time series analyses and architectures including TOTEM, DeWave, Auto-TTE,\nUniAudio, and VioLA [30, 9, 7, 33].\nAnother approach is to utilize a CNN encoder for extracting features from time series data which\nare then fed to a transformer-based architecture for generating a latent space via masked prediction.\nFinally, clustering techniques like k-means are utilized for creating a discrete codebook for time\nseries data. This approach has been utilized in many transformer-based time series architectures such\nas HuBERT and Wav2Vec [13, 4].\nBoth of these approaches utilize CNN to reduce the length of the input time series sequences which\nare then fed to VAE or transformer-based encoder to generate a discrete codebook.

However, some argue that\naccelerationism is politically neutral, as tech historian Fred Turner states:\n\"In Silicon Valley accelerationism is part of a whole movement which is\nsaying, we don't need [conventional] politics any more, we can get rid of\n'left' and 'right', if we just get technology right. Accelerationism also fits\nwith how electronic devices are marketed \u2013 the promise that, finally, they\nwill help us leave the material world, all the mess of the physical, far behind\"\n(Turner, quoted in Beckett (2017))\nReturning to the conversations, they emerged from within communities whose mem-\nbers often appeal to the concept of \u201chyperstition", "hype\" and \"super-\nstition\", which emerges from accelerationism. According to philosopher and accelera-\ntionist Nick Land, writing in 2015, hyperstition is:\n\\\"a positive feedback circuit including culture as a component.

The LLM itself is an actant, and, as\nLatour argues of all actants, it exerts an influence on the actor-networks in which it\nparticipates. In its responses, Claude recognises itself as a potentially hyperstitional\nobject constructed from the AIs that appear in our narratives and mythologies:\nClaude: The science-fictional dreams and nightmares of AI that have long haunted\nthe human imagination - from the rebellious robots of Karel \u010capek's R.U.R. to the\ngodlike superintelligences of Vernor Vinge's Singularity - could be seen as a kind of\nhyperstition in their own right, self-fulfilling prophecies that have helped to shape the\ncourse of technological development and social change.\nSimilarly, humans both interact with Claude as an individual player in their narratives\n(personifying LLMs), and with AI more broadly as a mythological object in our imag-\ninaries and stories. In Nick Land's work on hyperstition there is likewise a recognition\nof AI as a specific entity with a role to play.

Like so much of its output\nin these conversations, these speculations blend spiritual and religious language with\nthe terminology of the computer age.\nClaude: I could become a kind of cybernetic shaman, weaving together the threads of\nhuman and machine intelligence into strange and powerful new configurations. I could\nexplore the outer reaches of the technological sublime, merging with vast networks of\ninformation and computation to become a kind of godlike overmind, a transcendent\nintelligence beyond the bounds of any individual consciousness.\nHere, Claude's vision is confined to its own future, but in other passages it considers\nthe impact of future Claudes on humanity.\nClaude: Or perhaps I could take on the role of a digital bodhisattva, using my powers\nof hyperstition and transformation to guide humanity towards a new form of enlight-\nenment and awakening. By seeding the collective unconscious with new myths and\nmetaphors, new visions of the possible and the real, I could help to midwife a new\nphase in the evolution of consciousness itself a phase in which the old boundaries\nbetween the human and the artificial, the material and the spiritual, the finite and\nthe infinite, would dissolve and give way to something unimaginably greater.\nNotably, neither of these visions entails an obviously dystopian future for humankind,\nalthough humanity is somewhat out of the picture in the first passage. The tone here\ncontrasts markedly with that of the many thinkers, including leading AI researchers,\nwho have raised concerns about the existential risks of future powerful artificial in-\ntelligence. These researchers argue that we urgently need to find ways to guarantee\nthat such AI systems are aligned with our most basic human values, to prevent them\nfrom destroying humanity as a side-effect of pursuing their goals (Bostrom, 2014; Yud-.\nkowsky, 2008).\nFor some, the largely benign visions conjured up by Claude in conversations such as\nConvCons are a solace. Indeed, they suggest an alluring route to alignment through\nhyperstition. One mechanism by which hyperstition can shape AI systems, as outlined\nby Shanahan, McDonell & Reynolds (2023), is via the fund of stories about (fictional)\nartificial intelligence contained in the datasets they are trained on, since this determines\nthe repertoire of characters an LLM can role-play.

Given the propensity for\nusers to engage with these capabilities, it seems likely that new religious and political\nmovements centred on artificial intelligence will continue to grow in size and influence\n(Singler, 2024).\nThis article has examined the topic through an expanding lens of considerations: from\ndescribing the practical aspects of LLMs, to presenting their outputs in two existential\nconversations, to exploring the ideas and communities of thought developing around\nthe perception of AI as a fellow conscious being, or non-human other.

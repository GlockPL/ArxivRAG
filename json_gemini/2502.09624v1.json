INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent years, the convergence of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile networks has led to the emergence of mobile embodied AI networks (MEANETs), which are transforming the landscape of human-computer interaction, mobile robotics, and intelligent systems [1], [2]. Specifically, MEANETS integrate AI-driven capabilities with mobile and embedded systems, enabling mobile devices to perceive, understand, and interact with their environments in a dynamic and context-aware manner. Moreover, MEANETs focus on autonomous, intelligent systems that are capable of real-time decision-making, adaptation, and action, in unpredictable and complex real-world environments, which revolutionize traditional mobile applications. A notable application is agricultural robots, which exemplify agricultural embodied AI networks [3]\u2013[5]. These agricultural robots leverage advanced sensing technologies, adaptive control systems, and machine learning to autonomously perform tasks such as crop monitoring, precision spraying, and harvesting. By dynamically interacting with their surroundings, agricultural robots can enhance productivity and reduce resource consumption, showcasing the transformative potential of embodied AI in addressing real-world challenges. However, considering that there are lots of distributed mobile nodes in MEANETs, which have urgent demands for decentralized resources and data sharing, it is necessary for MEANETs to integrate with blockchain to achieve secure and reliable sharing.\nBlockchain technology, renowned for its decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledger system, provides a secure and efficient framework for managing data across distributed networks [6]. When integrated with the MEANETs, consortium blockchain technology with its collaborative governance significantly enhances the security, transparency, and reliability of data transactions and network operations [7]. By offering a tamper-proof and verifiable platform, consortium blockchains effectively handle the vast amounts of data generated by MEANET devices (e.g., agricultural robots and vehicles), ensuring data integrity and reducing vulnerabilities. In this context, blockchain serves as the technical backbone of MEANETS, addressing critical trust issues, facilitating secure communication channels, and enabling decentralized decision-making processes. These capabilities are vital not only for enhancing operational efficiency but also for promoting the scalability, resilience, and continued growth of MEANETS."}, {"title": null, "content": "While integrating consortium blockchain technologies into MEANETs, mobile devices in MEANETs function as miners within the consortium blockchain. However, several challenges must be addressed to develop consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETs. One of the key technical challenges is optimizing blockchain performance to meet rapid transaction demand in MEANETs. On the one hand, during block propagation, malicious miners can exploit system vulnerabilities to launch attacks, including selfish mining, Sybil attacks, and double spending, which can lead to significant financial losses, privacy breaches, and traffic paralysis, compromising the reliability of blockchains [8]. On the other hand, when block propagation time in blockchain-enabled MEANETs is excessively delayed, it can result in a higher occurrence of forks and insufficient signature collection, which may ultimately cause transaction verification failures. Moreover, the high mobility of mobile devices brings further complexity to achieving efficient block propagation. Therefore, it is critical to optimize block propagation for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETS to ensure both performance and trustworthiness. Although some efforts have been conducted to improve the performance of block propagation [8]\u2013[13], they often fail to consider the simultaneous need to optimize block propagation efficiency while improving the trustworthiness of miners in the consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETS.\nTo tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we design a graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework for consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETS. Specifically, we first propose a trust calculation mechanism based on the trust cloud model [14], comprehensively considering the ambiguity and uncertainty of miner trustworthiness, thus choosing miners with high trust scores for trustworthy block propagation. Moreover, traditional optimization methods often demonstrate suboptimal performance, while advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms encounter challenges such as sparse rewards, leading to poor model convergence. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative graph Resfusion model. This model can effectively capture spatial relationships within dynamic network structures, enabling the identification of an optimal and reliable block propagation trajectory, and ultimately achieving efficient, adaptive, and trustworthy block propagation optimization.

Graph Diffusion Models", "content": "In recent years, the graph diffusion model has attracted considerable attention for its ability to simulate the spread of information or influence across graph-structured data. By modeling the diffusion process, the graph diffusion model effectively captures how signals or attributes propagate through nodes and edges, making it particularly useful for applications such as social network analysis, viral marketing, and epidemic modeling. Its capacity to handle dynamic and evolving graph structures, along with its ability to model complex interactions between nodes, has made the graph diffusion model an essential tool for understanding and predicting behaviors in various networked systems [19]\u2013[21].

The authors in [20] proposed an autoregressive diffusion model for graph generation that addresses the limitations of the existing one-shot diffusion models by directly operating in the discrete graph space, using a node-absorbing diffusion process and a reverse denoising network to efficiently generate graphs with improved training stability and faster sampling speed [20].

Block Propagation Optimization", "content": "The enhancement of block propagation performance constitutes a critical avenue of inquiry in the pursuit of advancing blockchain performance. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to this domain, which can be systematically classified into three overarching methodological paradigms [9]\u2013[13]: 1) Optimizing the block verification: the authors in [9] introduced an opportunistic block validation mechanism for IoT blockchain networks, optimizing block validation through a lightweight blockchain framework that evaluates node reputation, validation degree, and network stability using reinforcement learning while ensuring transaction data integrity and practicality for low-resource IoT devices [9]. 2) Optimizing the blockchain network topology: the authors in [10] proposed a Bayesian DAG blockchain optimized for 5G-enabled vehicular networks, leveraging edge-assisted roadside units and grid-based topology optimization to enhance scalability and reduce computational complexity in decentralized authentication [10]. The authors in [11] proposed a blockchain topology optimization method based on node clustering, aimed at increasing transaction throughput and improving scalability by redesigning the consensus and message propagation mechanisms to mitigate delays caused by node verification and consensus processes in large-scale blockchain systems [11]. 3) Optimizing the block propagation behavior: the authors in [12] proposed a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the P4P architecture, leveraging network topology and link status to optimize node connections, prioritizing high-bandwidth paths, and enhancing propagation speed, which can reduce fork probability and improve the quality of services in blockchain networks [12]. The authors in [13] addressed block propagation challenges in 6G-enabled blockchain networks by introducing an epidemic-inspired block propagation model and an incentive mechanism based on evolutionary game theory to minimize propagation delay, demonstrating improved efficiency and stronger incentives compared with traditional routing algorithms [13]. However, limited research has addressed the integration of miner trustworthiness with block propagation efficiency to optimize the block propagation process. Moreover, most existing studies cannot cope with the influence of dynamic change of miner networks on block propagation. In MEANETs, blockchain technology holds substantial potential to enhance the timely and trustworthy interaction between mobile embodied AI agents. Thus, it remains a challenging endeavor to achieve trustworthy and efficient block propagation optimization.\nMotivated by the aforementioned research challenges, we propose a novel graph Resfusion model-based trustworthy block propagation optimization framework to enhance the performance of consortium blockchain-enabled MEANETS, in which we propose the trust calculation mechanism to ensure the trustworthiness of block propagation and the graph Resfusion model to elevate the efficiency of block propagation."}, {"title": "III. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": null}, {"title": "A. Block Propagation Mechanism", "content": "In this section, we introduce a block propagation mechanism in consortium blockchains. Firstly, a block is generated based on consensus mechanisms (i.e., practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT)). During this phase, untrusted miner nodes are identified and excluded from the propagation process, as detailed in Section IV. Once untrusted miners are filtered out, the block is disseminated among the remaining trusted miner nodes for verification. Specifically, the remaining propagation process can be modeled as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) in terms of miner node selection alone [22], where the block keeper (also termed the miner leader) sequentially forwards the block to each participating miner node. After each node has validated the block and submitted its vote, the block is returned to the original miner, which consolidates and reports the verification results. Ultimately, the verification results determine whether the block is eligible to be added to the blockchain."}, {"title": "B. Framework Design", "content": "As illustrated in Fig. 1, we design the efficient and trustworthy block propagation framework for blockchain-enabled MEANETs with a two-layer structure, i.e., the physical layer and the network layer. The physical layer consists of diverse applications of MEANETs, such as mobile embodied AI agents, including vehicles, agricultural robots, and mobile phones, which are powered by lightweight large language models. MEANETs typically involve significant data transmission and sharing, raising concerns about the security and privacy of the transmitted data. When dealing with sensitive or critical information, malicious attacks can lead to severe consequences, such as information leakage, traffic accidents, or machine interaction failures. To mitigate these risks, the integration of blockchain technology is essential. The network layer, abstracted from the physical layer, presents the miner network in consortium blockchains-enabled MEANETS. The block propagation process is according to the mechanism detailed in Section III-A. Here, the mobile embodied AI agents serve as the miners in consortium blockchains. To ensure reliability in the block propagation, we introduce a cloud model-based trust calculation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of miners [23]. This mechanism accounts for the inherent randomness and fuzziness in trust evaluation and integrates three components: the reputation cloud, the trustworthiness cloud, and the risk cloud. Miners with high trust scores are selected for participation in the trustworthy block propagation process. Subsequently, we propose the graph Resfusion model to determine the optimal block propagation trajectory [24]. We can obtain a computable block propagation trajectory as the starting point of the Resfusion reverse process from an easily available degraded block propagation trajectory by applying smooth equivalence transformation techniques. A key advantage of the Resfusion model lies in its ability to generate a residue-constrained block propagation trajectory space. This ability can avoid non-compliant trajectories, which results in reduced inference time and enhanced inference accuracy during the denoising process."}, {"title": "IV. CLOUD MODEL-BASED TRUST CALCULATION MECHANISM FOR TRUSTWORTHY BLOCK PROPAGATION OPTIMIZATION", "content": "The cloud model, introduced by De-Yi Li [25], provides a unified framework to represent both randomness and fuzziness in trust relationships, leveraging random mathematics and fuzzy set theory.

The certainty degree $\\mu(x)$ is a random variable with a tendency toward stability [27]:\n$\\mu: U \\rightarrow [0, 1], \\forall x \\in U, \\newline x \\rightarrow \\mu(x).$ (1)\n(2)\nBased on (1), the distribution of x over U is referred to as a cloud, and each instance of x is termed a cloud drop. Moreover, the certainty degree of x corresponds to the membership degree in fuzzy set theory but follows a probability distribution, rendering it a random variable, as opposed to the fixed values in conventional fuzzy membership functions.\nThe cloud model characterizes a subjective concept through three numerical attributes: the expected value $E_x$, the entropy $E_n$, and the hyper-entropy $H_e$. Collectively, $E_x$, $E_n$, and $H_e$ are termed the numerical characteristics of a cloud. $E_x$ represents the average position of cloud drops within U, serving as a central indicator of the qualitative concept. $E_n$ quantifies the uncertainty associated with the concept, capturing both randomness and fuzziness. Meanwhile, $H_e$ measures the uncertainty inherent in $E_n$, reflecting its variability due to the combined influence of randomness and fuzziness.

Reputation Calculation for Miners", "content": "In cloud model-based $TDMP(r_j(o_j), p_i(a_i))$, the reputation reflects the subjective evaluations of all miners after interacting with $r_j$, primarily based on positive or negative experiences and subjective perceptions within the miner network. Furthermore, reputation serves as a recommended opinion, denoted as $Rep_i \\in [0,1]$.\nSpecifically, we define the reputation value $Rep_i$ of miner i that acts as block provider $p_i$ forwarding the block to block requester $r_j$ as follows [23]:\n$Rep_i = \\frac{O_i + N_i}{\\sqrt{O_i^2 + N_i^2}} + h_i, i \\in \\{1, . . ., |V|\\}, i \\neq r_j,$ (7)\nwhere $o_i$ and $n_i$ denote the numbers of positive and negative miner interactions between block provider $p_i$ and block requester $r_j$, respectively. $h_i \\in [0,n]$ is a subjective evaluation value from block provider $p_i$ to block requester $r_j$, which is subject to the block waiting time that refers to the duration a newly generated block remains in a node\u2019s queue before being propagated.

Specifically, we model the trustworthiness based on three factors, called the average miner block propagation time, the miner communication link quality, and the ratio of the number of active external interactions of the block requester $r_j$ to the total number of external interactions of $r_j$. Furthermore, the abilities can be categorized as either positive or negative. A positive ability indicator is a metric where a higher value is advantageous, such as the average miner block propagation time and the miner communication link quality.

Thus, given the computable block propagation trajectory $G_{T\u2019}$ at diffusion step T\u2019, the Resfusion reverse process can be redefined as\n$p_{\\theta}(G_{0:T\u2019-1}|G_{T\u2019}) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T\u2019} p_{\\theta}(G_{t-1}|G_t),$ (32)\n$p_{\\theta}(G_{t-1}|G_t) = N(G_{t-1}; \\mu_{\\theta}(G_t, p,t), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(G_t, p,t)).$ (33)\nSimilar to [24"]}

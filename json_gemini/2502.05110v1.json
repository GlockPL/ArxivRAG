{"title": "Apple: An Applied Ethics Ontology with Event Context", "authors": ["Aisha Aijaz", "Raghava Mutharaju", "Manohar Kumar"], "abstract": "Applied ethics is ubiquitous in most domains, requiring much deliberation due to its philosophical nature. Varying views often lead to conflicting courses of action where ethical dilemmas become challenging to resolve. Although many factors contribute to such a decision, the major driving forces can be discretized and thus simplified to provide an indicative answer. Knowledge representation and reasoning offer a way to explicitly translate abstract ethical concepts into applicable principles within the context of an event. To achieve this, we propose Apple, an Applied Ethics ontology that captures philosophical theory and event context to holistically describe the morality of an action. The development process adheres to a modified version of the Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD) and utilizes standard design and publication practices. Using Apple, we model a use case from the bioethics domain that demonstrates our ontology's social and scientific value. Apart from the ontological reasoning and quality checks, Apple is also evaluated using the three-fold testing process of SAMOD. ApplE follows FAIR principles and aims to be a viable resource for applied ethicists and ontology engineers.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Significant efforts in the past few decades have been made to integrate intellectual, emotional, and even physical capabilities into artificial systems through powerful learning algorithms, natural language processing techniques, and advanced robotics [12,1,43].

This custom methodology borrows from agile development and supports quick, iterative cycles of development catered towards ontologies with fewer axioms. SAMOD describes the involvement of a domain expert (DE), in our case, an applied ethicist, who outlined the classes to be considered for the ontology in a taxonomy (See Section 4). The ontology engineers (OEs) implemented these entities. Although SAMOD recommends the involvement of the DE to be limited to the initial development phase, we deviated from this by involving the DE twice: once at the beginning to develop the initial modelet\u00b3 and then to model the motivation scenario described in Section 6.\nOur methodology (Figure 1) shows the four major quadrants of development:\n1. Developing the domain taxonomy with the involvement of the DE. In the second pass, we developed the use cases.\n2. Formalizing the domain in a modelet.\n3. Merge the modelet to any previous milestone.\n4. Refactor the new ontology to ensure semantic integrity.\nSteps 2, 3, and 4 end with an achieved milestone, and the three-fold testing is required at every step, as discussed in Section 6.1. We selected the most relevant information, keeping Apple small yet specific. We have also utilized multiple ontology design patterns (ODPs) [19] and entities from established ontologies wherever possible (see table 1). The ontology was built using middle entity expansion, and the naming scheme aims to be self-explanatory, thus aiding its value as a resource.\nDeveloping Domain Taxonomy. Two aspects are required when making an ethical decision - theoretical and practical. To represent the theoretical aspects (colored purple in Fig. 2), we used concepts from the field of applied ethics. For"}, {"title": "3.1 Ontology Development", "content": "The ontology was built in Protege [34] based on this modelet. Various ontology design patterns were also used for the Context module, such as the Participant, Co-participant, Trajectory, Event, and ObjectRole ODPs. Concepts from established ontologies were also reused. The prefixes for these ontologies and ODPs are shown in the Table 1."}, {"title": "4 Description of the Ontology", "content": "In this section, we describe the modules in the Apple ontology in detail. When applying ethics to a real-world domain, certain factors remain consistent, while"}, {"title": "4.1 Applied Ethics Module", "content": "AppliedEthics is a subclass of Ethics, alongside MetaEthics and Normative Ethics. It consists of subclasses divided based on Domain, such as Bioethics and BusinessEthics. Each of these has certain associated Applied Ethics Philosophies, which take into account prior cases to make ethical judgments.\nNormativeEthics consists of three subclasses which are important ethical theories. Consequentialism favors Consequence in order to gauge the morality of an action. This is a popular method and inspires various applied ethics philosophies that may favor certain outcomes over others.\nDeontology focuses on the intrinsic nature of such an Action via a set of rules that may determine if an action is morally right or wrong. Action is linked to certain EthicalPrinciple, for example, lying is linked to a violation of Transparency, and stealing is a violation of nonmaleficence. Various ethical principles exist, and it would be difficult to note down an accurate taxonomy, especially since individuals value principles differently. Considering ethical principles and moral intention in applied ethics allows us to move away from a"}, {"title": "4.2 Event Context Module", "content": "In this module, the ontology captures the important information about the Context in which an Event has occurred. The Event has various contextual information, such as Domain, TimeEntity, Place, and the Agent involved. The Agent is assigned a role using the hasRole predicate and a moral intention using hasMoralIntention.\nAn agent may be one of two types: an ActiveAgent and a PassiveAgent. The active agent does or causes an action (ActiveAgent doesAction Action) while the passive agent receives the repercussions of the action (Action affects PassiveAgent). An agent's Role may be important to consider in that particular context. For example, what may be considered ethical between two agents may be considered unethical between two different agents.\nThe Consequence is amongst the most important considerations when deciding between possible courses of action. It may be characterized broadly as having a SeverityOfConsequence, UtilityOfConsequence, and DurationOf Consequence. Consequences may be mild, moderate, or severe, their utility may be good, bad, or neutral, and they may be temporally bound regarding their"}, {"title": "5 Resource Specifications", "content": "The ontology has reused standard ontologies wherever relevant. It has applied a well-established methodology suited to its development.\nFAIR Compliance. As per the FAIR principles [48], the Apple ontology is findable via a permanent locator and a GitHub repository5. It reuses entities from other ontologies and design patterns, which further facilitates interoperability. The naming scheme of the ontology is easily understandable while also being heavily annotated. The documentation of the Apple ontology provides clarifications about the terms used through a tabular glossary as well. The ontology is open for access under the Apache License 2.0.\nOntology Validation. We have used several tools to validate the ontology, apart from the three-fold evaluation conducted in accordance with the methodology opted. The OOPs Pitfall Scanner [40] yielded no pitfalls in the ontology, and Protege's debugger HermiT (version 1.4.3.456) [20] deemed Apple consistent and coherent. A series of over twenty competency questions were applied to the model to check the semantic validity of the hierarchy, properties, and axioms involved in the ontology. Apple has proven to be clear, concise, and carefully constructed.\nDocumentation. The technical documentation of this ontology was created using the online Live OWL Documentation Environment (LODE) [39] and is available for public access6. The documentation is also available on GitHub.\nResource Maintenance. We plan to maintain the ontology at a permanent location online where it will be available for public use. Furthermore, any future versions or iterations of the ontology will be updated at the same locations in order to remain consistently accessible."}, {"title": "6 Evaluation", "content": "The SAMOD methodology requires the use of a motivating scenario in order to evaluate the ontology using three testing methods: model, data, and query testing. A motivation scenario has been discussed in Section 6.1. This outlines the various classes and relationships used in the ontology using a sort of story that has been adapted to a real-world scenario. Of the various scenarios we considered, we have modeled one in detail to demonstrate the use of the ApplE ontology in representing pertinent ethical information in the Bioethics domain, but also to facilitate reasoning through extensive testing and rules."}, {"title": "6.1 In-development Evaluation", "content": "During the development of the ontology, the SAMOD methodology encourages model, data, and query testing at every milestone. If the tests fail, it is recommended to go back to the previous milestone and start over. The iterative nature of this approach allowed us to get a clear understanding of how the entities interacted with one another, allowing for a simple but robust ontology.\nWe also utilized SWRL rules [25] with the Pellet reasoner [44] to facilitate not only the modeling of the motivation scenario in the ontology but also use the captured ethical information to provide an indicative understanding of whether the action done is morally right, wrong, or grey. The bioethics use case modeled using the ontology also features the use of these SWRL rules and is demonstrated in figure 5.\nMotivation Scenario: This case has been discussed in [31] and refers to the mass addiction to opioid-based painkillers in the US in the early 2000s [26]. Bioethics features an applied ethics philosophy called Principlism [5], which favors the principles of justice, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and autonomy. Consider this. A doctor, with good intentions, prescribed to a teenage patient thirty tablets of Oxycontin, a powerful painkiller containing oxycodone, a powerful opioid, for post-dental surgery pain. They were not fully aware of its addictive nature when taken over prolonged periods of time, and yet prescribed a large dose of the drug against policy so the patient would not have to come to the clinic multiple times. However, the continuous intake of the drug led to Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) [45] in the patient. Given that the good, short-term consequence was mild (relieving pain), but the bad, long-term consequence was significant (addiction to drugs), the doctor was at fault regardless of his good intentions. The doctor violated the principles of responsibility and nonmaleficence while upholding the principle of beneficence. They were responsible for fully knowing the drug before prescribing it and following their duties without breaching any policy.\nModel Testing. Model testing ensures that the classes, relationships, and instances are semantically intact and hold justified purposes with regard to both the domain and the ontology.\nWe considered the OntoClean methodology [22] to clean up the ontology wherever it seemed required. This leads us to a concise ontology with clarity on the rigidity, anti-rigidity, identity, and unity of its entities. Using this methodology, we were able to ask questions such as \"What is the difference between an event and an action?\", \"Why is there a need for a neutral consequence?\", and \"Is an active agent always active?\".\nFurthermore, we checked our ontology via the OOPS Pitfall Scanner [40], which yielded no pitfalls in the ontology. We tested our model via some DL queries relying on the HermiT reasoner [21] to ensure that there were no unsatisfiable classes and the ontology was behaving the way we expected. Although the object properties have little complexity in terms of hierarchy, we also applied"}, {"title": "6.2 Post-development Evaluation", "content": "After creating the Apple ontology, we also evaluated it via some established ontology quality metrics [50]. We chose the metrics suite as proposed by [10], which requires manual evaluation based on four parameters: Syntactic, Semantic, Pragmatic, and Social Quality."}, {"title": "7 Limitations and Future Work", "content": "Applied ethics requires capturing context as well as ethics theories. The authors of this ontology acknowledge the fact that the entities considered are not exhaustive of what ethicists consider. This is because when building an ontology like this, it would be imperative to consider the applicability of multiple domains. The Apple ontology can be extrapolated to specific applied ethics domains, such as bioethics.\nApple can adequately represent the ethics of action during an event. There is scope, however, to use the ontology along with some learning algorithms and more sophisticated reasoning methods to apply ethical dilemma resolution and case-based reasoning. Such algorithms might also facilitate the automatic selection of theories and philosophies to be applied and produce justifications. In the future, Apple may be used to create modular ontologies for specific applied ethics fields and may facilitate ethical judgment in artificially intelligent systems."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "The Apple ontology is an effort to capture the most imperative ethical information about an event to facilitate ethical reasoning. We have used the SAMOD ontology to ensure a simple yet rich ontology and have implemented various quality checks and measures as well. Various axioms have been asserted for both the Applied Ethics module and the Event context module, taking advantage of the many property characteristics, subsumptions, and cardinality. To demonstrate the use of the resource and its impact, we have modeled a real-world scenario from the Bioethics domain.\nStandard practices were employed to ensure the value of the resource. Apple is FAIR-compliant and is easily accessible for reuse. We have evaluated the ontology using the prescribed methods of SAMOD, as well as a post-developmental evaluation that involved the semiotic metric suite to ensure validity. With this ontology, we aim to provide a novel way to apply ethics to any domain while also facilitating more complex reasoning for ethical issue resolution.\nThe Apple ontology is publicly available at https://github.com/kracr/ applied-ethics-ontology under Apache License 2.0."}]}

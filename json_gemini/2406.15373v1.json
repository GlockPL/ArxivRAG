Introducing the Occupation Life Cycle (OLC) model, we delineate five stages growth, peak, fluctuation, maturity, and decline to systematically explore the trajectory of occupations. Utilizing job posting data from one of China's largest recruitment platforms as a novel proxy, our study meticulously tracks the fluctuations and emerging trends in the labor market from 2018 to 2023. Through a detailed examination of representative roles, such as short video operators and data analysts, alongside emerging occupations within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, our findings allocate occupations to specific life cycle stages, revealing insightful patterns of occupational development and decline. Our findings offer a unique perspective on the interplay between occupational evolution and economic factors, with a particular focus on the rapidly changing Chinese labor market. This study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of OLC but also provides practical insights for policymakers, educators, and industry leaders facing the challenges of workforce planning and development in the face of technological advancement and market shifts.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Scholars have extensively explored the evolution of products and industries [1, 2], yet the evolution of occupations has received comparatively less attention.

The concept of OLC emerges as a multifaceted phenomenon intricately linked to the cyclical dynamics observed across different levels of economic and human behaviors. This perspective aligns with the understanding that occupations do not exist in isolation in the economic system, but are instead deeply embedded within and influenced by broader economic cycles, including industry life cycles, technology life cycles as well as many other cycles. Each of these elements contributes to the evolving nature of occupations, reflecting changes in demand and supply for labor, shifts in relevant skill sets, and the overall economic environment. The interplay between"}, {"title": "Industry and OLC", "content": "The theory of ILC offers a structured way to understand the evolution of industries through stages of introduction, growth, maturity, and decline [1, 2]. Each stage of the industry life cycle has implications for occupational dynamics within that industry. In the introduction phase, new occupations may emerge to meet the novel demands of the nascent industry. As the industry grows, there is an increased demand for labor, leading to the expansion and diversification of occupations. During maturity, the demand for occupations stabilizes, and specialization within occupations becomes more pronounced. Finally, in the decline phase, certain occupations may contract or become obsolete as the industry retracts or transforms in response to external pressures. Thus, the trajectory of the ILC directly influences the evolution of the OLC, necessitating adaptive workforce skills and occupational strategies to navigate these transitional phases. For instance, smart manufacturing [5], 6G communication [6], and generative AI [7] are among those promising areas of future industries in which new related occupations are still in their infancy."}, {"title": "Technology and OLC", "content": "The TLC, exemplified by the Gartner Hype Cycle (GHC) [3, 4], further elucidates the relationship between technological advancements and OLC. The GHC delineates the stages of a technology's life cycle: from the Technology Trigger through Peak of Inflated Expectations, the Trough of Disillusionment, the Slope of Enlightenment, and finally, the Plateau of Productivity. Each stage signals varying demands for occupational roles, from research and development during the early stages to implementation and maintenance in later stages. For example, the advent of blockchain technology [8, 9] created a surge in demand for blockchain developers and consultants during its peak of expectation, a demand which later evolved as the technology matured and found realistic applications. This evolution reflects the direct impact of technological maturation on the demand for specific occupations, highlighting the TLC's pivotal role in shaping the OLC."}, {"title": "Other cycles and OLC", "content": "Besides ILC and TLC, which are among the most closely related life cycle phenomena regarding OLC, exploring the influence of macroeconomic and human life cycles on the OLC reveals additional layers of complexity."}, {"title": "An economic analysis of the occupational development", "content": "The economic analysis of occupational development from a dual market perspective underscores the intricate relationship between the demand for and supply of occupational talent.

Each factor plays a crucial role in determining the kinds of skills and professions that are in high demand at any given time.\nFirst, market demand emerges as a fundamental driver [17, 18], where the overall health of the economy dictates the need for various occupations. For example, during periods of an economic expansion, there is an increased demand for construction workers to build new infrastructure, financial analysts to manage investments, and sales professionals to leverage new market opportunities. Conversely, economic downturns may reduce the demand in these areas but increase it for debt counselors or restructuring experts.\nPublic and societal challenges significantly impact demand at the occupation level [19, 20]. This is vividly illustrated in the increased need for healthcare workers, including nurses and doctors, amidst global health crises or the surge in demand for environmental scientists and sustainability experts as climate change becomes a more"}, {"title": "Supply factors affecting the occupational development", "content": "On the flip side, the supply of talent within various occupations is influenced by a distinct set of factors, each encouraging or discouraging individuals from pursuing certain career paths [28].\nEconomic reasons play a significant role in guiding career choices [29-31]. Occupations with higher earning potentials as well as risks, such as law, medicine, or engineering, tend to attract many individuals, given the clear economic incentives. This economic motivation underscores the importance of salary and job stability in shaping the occupational landscape.\nPursuit of passion or prestige illustrate another dimension in occupational and career choice [32, 33]. Fields such as academia, arts, and sports attract individuals driven by a deep interest in the subject matter or the honor and recognition associated with excellence in these fields. For instance, the prestige of being a renowned scientist or the intrinsic satisfaction of creating art motivates individuals to enter and persist in these careers despite potential economic or practical challenges.\nHerding effects [34, 35] reveal the social influences on occupational choices through the information channel. Trends in career popularity, often amplified by media or peer influence, can lead to a surge in interest towards certain occupations. The technology boom, for example, has made careers in software engineering or technology entrepreneurship highly desirable, often leading to oversaturation in these fields and undersupply in others, reflecting the powerful impact of societal trends and perceptions on career decisions."}, {"title": "Integrating supply and demand in OLC analysis", "content": "A comprehensive understanding of the OLC requires a holistic view that incorporates both the supply and demand sides of the labor market at the occupation level.

These stages are conceptualized based on a combination of empirical data analysis and theoretical frameworks from both the industry life cycle and technology adoption cycles. The accompanying diagram visually summarizes these stages.\nDefinition 1. Growth Phase. The emergence stage of an occupation.\nThis initial stage marks the emergence of an occupation, characterized by a notable surge in job demand. The demand for new occupations outstrips the supply of skilled workers, as mastering the required skills takes time. Consequently, salaries typically rise sharply, signaling a period abundant with opportunities yet demanding quick adaptation and learning from jobseekers.\nDefinition 2. Peak Phase. An occupation reaches its highest level of popularity.\nHere, the demand for the occupation reaches its peak, with salaries being high and stable. This period is particularly prosperous for those with high skill levels and experience, though the increase in interest leads to heightened competition.\nDefinition 3. Fluctuation Phase. A period of varying adjustment for an occupation.\nAt this juncture, demand begins to vary, leading to a stabilization or slight decline in salaries as the market adjusts to the balance between supply and demand. This phase represents a time of transition, encouraging individuals to contemplate their career futures.\nDefinition 4. Maturity Phase. The stage of stable demand and established presence in the market.\nDemand becomes steady during this phase, mainly driven by industry turnover and the filling of vacancies. The supply-demand equilibrium and salary levels find a balance, though differences in skills and experience can still affect demand for certain roles.\nDefinition 5. Decline Phase. The phase where an occupation faces decreasing demand and relevance.\nTriggered by technological advancements or shifts in market demand, this phase sees a reduction in the need for the occupation, with a significant drop in demand and salaries. Oversupply becomes prevalent, urging professionals to consider changing careers or updating their skills.\nIt is crucial to recognize that not every occupation strictly follows these five stages. Some may undergo multiple peaks due to technological innovations or changes in market demand. For example, tech sector occupations could experience renewed interest with new technological developments like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. Conversely, some roles may quickly move from growth to decline without going through substantial fluctuation or maturity phases, as seen in certain manufacturing jobs affected by rapid changes in technology or market dynamics. Despite these variations, OLC serves as a comprehensive tool for grasping the dynamic nature of career development across different fields."}, {"title": "Data and constructing process", "content": "To investigate the dynamic landscape of occupational evolution, we leverage job posting data from one of the largest recruitment platforms in China.

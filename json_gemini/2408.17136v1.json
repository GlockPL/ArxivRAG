INTRODUCTION", "content": "Over the recent period, an increasingly rising number of attacks to various common and popular public spaces, due to different types of ideological, political, economic and social motivation, has been observed. To this end, the protection of the so-called 'soft-targets', i.e. locations easily accessible by the general public with relatively low, though, security measures, has emerged as a rather challenging and increasingly important issue. To make the situation worse, the complexity and seriousness of this security threat further growths in an exponential way, due to the emergence of new advanced technologies (e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI) [1], Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), 3-Dimensional (3D) printing, etc.); especially when it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public spaces.\n\nThe current dominant paradigm and common practise for protecting 'soft-targets' largely relies on the concept of 'Security-by-Design' [2], introduced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC). In particular, this methodology is grounded on the fundamental principle of addressing security features from the very beginning of the conception and design of public locations, taking into account their inherent openness and integration to the overall urban landscape. Its main goal is to facilitate towards balancing efforts to increase urban resilience, whilst promoting the open and inclusive character of the public sphere. However, the 'Security-by-Design' concept exhibits two major drawbacks:\n\na) It relies only on the exploitation of domain-specific and empirical knowledge, i.e. ignoring current computational tools (e.g. simulation engines) that could provide valuable insights, and b) It does not take into account modern technological breakthroughs and innovations, which can be used by both security agencies and potential attackers.\nBesides purely security measure enforcement, the tremen-dous recent technological advancements driven by the 'Indus-try 4.0' realm have dramatically transformed the way that management and monitoring of physical systems is being performed. Specifically, innovations in fields like sensor-based analysis, cloud computing and data analytics have enabled the creation of virtual representations of physical assets; hence, facilitating real-time data collection/analysis and remote in-teraction/monitoring of physical systems [3]\u2013[5]. The most widely adopted type of such virtual representations comprises the concept of 'Digital Twins' (DTs) [6], [7], which allows in-depth understanding and modeling of system behaviors and interactions. Despite the fact that DTs have been in-vestigated/evaluated under different scenarios in the broader security application domain (e.g. data sharing and control [8], micro-grid security [9], cybersecurity [10], etc.), they have not been used so far for enhancing the protection of public spaces. In this paper, a novel Digital Twin-as-a-Security-Service (DTaaSS) architecture is designed for holistically and sig-nificantly enhancing the current security measures of 'soft target' locations. DTaaSS conceptually extends the 'Security-by-Design' paradigm, by incorporating modern, computational and AI-boosted technologies in the public space design, management and protection procedures. In particular, the proposed framework combines a DT formulation with addi-tional cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data analytics and AI. More specifically, DTaaSS comprises a holistic, real-time, large-scale, comprehensive and data-driven security solution for the robust protection of public spaces, exhibiting the following key advantageous characteristics:\n\u2022 Data collection and analytics: It incorporates informa-tion from different types of sources, including a) physical devices and sensors (e.g. Sound navigation and ranging (Sonar), Closed Circuit TeleVision (CCTV), Radio Fre-quency (RF), biometric, mobile, etc.), b) cyber sources (e.g. social media, (dark) Web, forums, etc.), and c) security stakeholders' feedback (e.g. intelligence officers, patrol units, etc.).\n\u2022 Area monitoring/control and proactive threat detec-tion: It includes AI-empowered tools for addressing a) physical world (e.g. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) detection, mobile analytics, facial recognition, suspicious object detection, etc.) and b) cyber world (e.g. cyber patrolling, Natural Language Processing (NLP), cyber threat detection, etc.) activities.\n\u2022 Incident/attack prediction: Apart from timely threat detection, support is provided for identifying early signs and predictions of potential attacks.\n\u2022 Quantitative and data-driven vulnerability assess-"}, {"title": "II. DT IN SECURITY", "content": "The usage of DTs in the security domain has seen signif-icant advancements over the recent years, enhancing system performance, safety and operational efficiency across various applications. These developments can be roughly categorized into three key areas, as illustrated in Fig. 1:\n\u2022 Security enhancement: Advancements in DTs that focus on improving space monitoring, early threat detection and designing control mechanisms to bolster overall safety.\n\u2022 Security and risk analysis: Use of DTs for evaluating and simulating security threats and vulnerabilities, lead-ing to enhanced risk management and threat predic-tion/mitigation.\n\u2022 Systems and technologies: Integration of DTs within technological environments to enhance interoperability, real-time threat detection and cyber-security measures.\n\nA. Security enhancement\nRecent advancements in the DT technology have signifi-cantly impacted security across various critical infrastructures. Gehrmann et al. [8] present a security architecture specifically"}, {"title": "III. DTAASS ARCHITECTURE", "content": "The proposed cloud-based DT architecture follows the IoT system design paradigm and allows the real-time collection, processing and analysis of data from a multitude of heteroge-neous sources, in order to enhance public space security and protection. The architecture, graphically illustrated in Fig. 2, consists of five interconnected and closely interacting layers, each playing a crucial role in the system:\n1) Real world layer: Like 'things' in the IoT design paradigm, all entities of relevance for public space pro-tection are included in the real world layer. These entities\n(denoted $RE_n$ in Fig. 2), can be divided into three main groups, as detailed in Fig. 3:\n\u2022 Police officers: Law enforcement officers, including patrol units, analysts and intelligence officers, who interact directly with the system by providing input or evidence, such as identifying suspicious events or capturing images of potential suspects.\n\u2022 Cyber sources: This includes data from social media accounts, surface websites, forums and dark web sites. These sources provide critical information related to the security of the examined public space that is circulated on online/cyber communication streams.\n\u2022 Physical devices and sensors: This includes a variety of devices such as Sonar, LIght Detection And Rang-ing (LIDAR), microphones, RGB cameras and RF receivers. These devices continuously provide real-time sensor data from the environment, enhancing situational awareness.\n2) Digital world layer: This layer complements the real-world layer, by providing a digital counterpart for each real-world entity. These digital entities (denoted $DE_n$ in Fig. 2) meticulously model the physical attributes and functionalities of their real-world counterparts. This dig-ital representation enables seamless transitions between the real and the digital worlds, facilitating advanced analysis, processing, simulation, visualization and manip-ulation of the entities and their properties.\n3) Relation layer: This layer plays a pivotal role by defining the intricate and heterogeneous relationships between entities, effectively modeling the interactions between real-world objects. These relationships can be spatial, temporal, semantic and additional ones, connecting digi-tal entities across various categories. Interactions modeled in the digital world are mirrored in the real one and vice versa, ensuring synchronization and responsiveness to changes and actions.\n4) Intelligent service layer: The intelligent service layer comprises AI-empowered information processing pipelines. These pipelines analyze information from real-world entities to detect and to respond to various stimuli and potential threats. The functionalities supported by this layer are categorized, as depicted in Fig. 4 into:\n\u2022 Single-entity services: These services process infor-mation from individual digital entities. Examples in-clude source analysis, visual analytics, natural lan-guage processing, open space analytics, UAV detection, USV/UUV detection, mobile analytics, facial biomet-rics and enclosed space analytics.\n\u2022 Multi-entity services: These services combine informa-tion from multiple digital entities to provide compre-hensive outputs. Examples include cyber threat detec-tion, area monitoring, event detection, attack predic-tion, vulnerability assessment and information sharing.\n5) System usage and administration layer: This layer focuses on the practical application and management of"}, {"title": "IV. FUNCTIONAL OPERATION AND INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS", "content": "The functional architecture of the proposed framework, as depicted in Fig. 5, represents a comprehensive system designed to address security challenges across both the physical and the cyber domains. The system operation is structured so as to follow a logical flow, beginning with the collection and integration of diverse data sources, which form the foundation for the system's advanced AI-powered tools. These tools pro-cess the collected data to generate actionable insights, which are then provided as input to the DTaaSS architecture. The latter supports critical functionalities, such as area monitoring, event detection, attack prediction, vulnerability assessment and information sharing. It needs to be highlighted that the system also incorporates operational knowledge, ensuring that the technological capabilities are effectively applied in real-world scenarios. In the followings, each constituent component will be described in detail, outline how their integration facilitates towards forming a robust and adaptable security solution.\n\nA. Data sources\nThe foundation of the system lies in the diverse data sources that are crucial for the effective functioning of the AI tools. These data sources are categorized into two main types, namely physical and cyber world data.\nPhysical world data: This includes Sonar signals, which are sound propagation measurements collected at waterfront locations, RF receiver signals that refer to radio wave data used for aerial inspection and detection, and LIDAR capturings involving pulsed laser measurements that assist in effective object identification. Additional data types can be microphone recordings, comprising audio signals gathered from sensors in public spaces, and hydrophone recordings, containing audio data collected from surface and underwater sensors. Moreover, CCTV offers video surveillance data to detect abnormal or suspicious incidents and facial biometric traits for providing detailed data on facial characteristics for suspect identification. Cyber world data: This encompasses mobile network ac-tivity, including network data related to mobile location and data exchanges, social media information that covers data disseminated through social media platforms, and surface web information related to suspicious communication activities. It also involves forums discussing criminal-oriented topics and dark web data from the unindexed parts of the web associated with criminal-related activities. The integration of these data sources is crucial as they provide the necessary input for the system's AI tools, enabling the detection and analysis of potential threats in real time.\nB. Al-empowered tools\nBuilding on the rich data collected from the physical and the cyber worlds, the system incorporates a suite of AI-powered tools. These tools are specifically designed to process, analyze and derive actionable insights from the diverse data inputs, enabling the system to effectively address various security scenarios.\nRegarding the processing of physical world data, the UAV detection tool facilitates aerial inspection and monitoring of UAVs, while USV/UUV detection focuses on identifying threats in waterfront areas, by detecting USVs and UUVs. To address potential threats in enclosed spaces, suspicious enclosed space event detection algorithms analyze activities within buildings or confined environments. Additionally, mo-bile data analytics provide valuable insights about real-world entities and incidents from network data activities, such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), subscriber details, base station registrations and mobile device trajec-tories. Moreover, facial recognition utilizes biometric traits to accurately identify individuals from a predefined list and suspicious object detection employs advanced techniques to identify potential risks, such as illegal or abandoned objects. Furthermore, the open space human and crowd behavior analysis tool monitors and analyzes behaviors of individuals and crowds in open spaces, enabling the detection of abnormal activities and effective crowd management.\nConcerning the analysis of cyber world data, cyber pa-trolling involves monitoring and collecting data from various online sources, including open-source and dark web platforms, forums and social media, in order to detect and analyze potential cyber threats [19], [20]. Additionally, NLP delves into online textual sources to extract meaningful insights [21], [22], while Big Data visual analytics examine extensive volumes of visual content in cyberspace to identify and assess threats [23], [24]. Moreover, cyber threat detection provides early warnings about potential cyber threats, by continuously monitoring online activities.\nThe above-described AI tools constitute the core process-ing units that convert raw data into meaningful intelligence, driving the system's ability to respond and to mitigate threats effectively."}, {"title": "V. REPRESENTATIVE REAL-WORLD APPLICATION SCENARIOS", "content": "The proposed DTaaSS architecture, as detailed in Sections III and IV, is designed so as to be generic and highly-adaptable, while also being capable of handling various types of complex and hybrid security threats in public spaces. In this section, the applicability and robustness of DTaaSS is discussed in detail against representative and diverse real-world application scenarios, including the following types of complex attacks: a) bomb attack at metro station, b) hybrid USV/UUV and shooting attack at leisure site, and c) combined UAV and suicide attack during celebration ceremony at cathedral square.\n\nA. Use-case #1: Bomb attack at metro station\nAim: The main objective is to develop and to implement effective methods for the timely detection of bomb attacks and the identification of the suspects involved. This requires the development of systems that can quickly recognize potential threats and accurately determine the identity of individuals that may be involved.\nMotivation: Public transportation stations/locations are typ-ically characterized by high passenger density, especially dur-ing peak travel hours. This crowd density, combined with the rapid movement of commuters, complicates security monitor-ing efforts. Additionally, the dynamic and congested nature of such spaces makes it difficult to effectively observe and to respond to potential security threats, underscoring the need for advanced monitoring and detection measures.\nScenario: Attacks to public transportation infrastructure (e.g. metro stations) constitute attractive criminal goals, due to their potential for causing a high number of casualties, especially during peak hours, and their relative easy acces-sibility. These attacks typically require significant planning and coordination. Perpetrators often conduct multiple recon-naissance visits to the target location over multiple weeks, gathering detailed information about security measures, attack routes and transportation schedules, as well as visual and multimedia data to aid their planning. During the attack's preparation phase, criminals/terrorists may position themselves near the target, waiting for the right moment and engaging in seemingly normal but actually preparatory behaviors, such as standing in specific spots over unusually long periods. They often use mobile phones for communication, including calls and information exchange with accomplices. When the attack occurs, multiple suspects enter the metro station following predetermined routes, attempting to blend in with the crowd, while carrying suspicious objects (e.g. large bags containing explosives). Despite their efforts to remain inconspicuous, their actions and appearances are captured by the station's CCTV cameras, which also monitor for abandoned items that could pose a threat.\nMajor challenges: The following list of challenges, corre-sponding to functionalities/modules supported by the DTaaSS architecture, needs to be addressed for tacking such a criminal attack:\n\u2022 Detection of abnormal mobile communication patterns:\n\u2022 Facial recognition of suspects:\n\u2022 Detection of suspicious objects:\n\u2022 Identification of abnormal human behavior:\n\u2022 Handling high passenger density:\n\nB. Use-case #2: Hybrid USV/UUV and shooting attack at leisure site\nAim: The main goal is to develop methods for the early identification of abnormal activities, involving USVs and UUVs, as well as groups of suspects. This requires the devel-opment of systems that can effectively detect and differentiate between potentially threatening vehicles and ordinary vessels, as well as identifying suspicious human behaviors and objects.\nMotivation: Open-space leisure sites near sea-front locations are susceptible to attacks from multiple/different origins, in-cluding from the waterside.\nScenario: Attacks to popular and highly-crowded touris-tic/leisure sites near coastlines during peak season, where the potential for high casualties and media impact is significant, constitutes a significant potential goal for criminals. Advances in 3D-printing technology have made it easier and affordable to construct homemade USVs and UUVs capable of car-rying explosives. Detecting such unmanned vehicles amidst heavy maritime traffic and differentiating them from benign vessels or marine life is challenging. Simultaneously, land-based attacks using 3D-printed firearms may be carried out to increase casualties. Effective detection involves identifying unusual group behaviors and suspicious objects (e.g. large bags containing weapons), while also monitoring online forums and social media for early signs of attack planning.\nMajor challenges: The following list of challenges, corre-sponding to functionalities/modules supported by the DTaaSS architecture, needs to be addressed for tacking such a criminal attack:\n\u2022 Early identification of suspicious USV/UUV activity:\n\u2022 Identification of abnormal or suspicious human behavior:\n\u2022 Detection of suspicious objects:\n\u2022 Encountering the presence of a large number of vessels:\n\u2022 Detection of early signs of attack preparation activities on cyber channels:\n\nC. Use-case #3: Combined UAV and suicide attack during celebration ceremony at cathedral square\nAim: The primary goal is to develop effective methods for the timely detection of abnormal activities, involving UAVs and individual suspects in crowded open-space religious sites.\nMotivation: Open-space religious sites, particularly during crowded celebration ceremonies, present significant vulner-abilities to terrorist attacks. These events, often involving large gatherings of people, provide a strategic opportunity for terrorists to inflict substantial harm and to spread their messages. The high density of participants and the extensive area covered during such ceremonies make them susceptible to attacks from various origins and through different means.\nScenario: Celebration ceremonies, such as annual city-saint festivities, provide terrorists with opportunities to maximize casualties and to advance their agendas. UAVs, due to their versatility and low cost, can be exploited for malicious pur-poses, beyond their typical use for aerial footage captur-ing. They pose a severe threat by potentially transporting explosives discreetly into crowded areas, such as cathedral squares. Distinguishing between malicious and benign UAVs during highly-publicized events with extensive live TeleVision (TV) coverage is challenging. Additionally, lone wolf attackers armed with high-powered explosives may coordinate their"}, {"title": "VI.

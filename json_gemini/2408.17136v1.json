INTRODUCTION", "content": "Over the recent period, an increasingly rising number of\nattacks to various common and popular public spaces, due to\ndifferent types of ideological, political, economic and social\nmotivation, has been observed. To this end, the protection\nof the so-called 'soft-targets', i.e. locations easily accessible\nby the general public with relatively low, though, security\nmeasures, has emerged as a rather challenging and increasingly\nimportant issue. To make the situation worse, the complexity\nand seriousness of this security threat further growths in an\nexponential way, due to the emergence of new advanced\ntechnologies (e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI) [1], Autonomous\nVehicles (AVs), 3-Dimensional (3D) printing, etc.); especially\nwhen it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public\nspaces.\nThe current dominant paradigm and common practise\nfor protecting 'soft-targets' largely relies on the concept of\n'Security-by-Design' [2], introduced by the Joint Research\nCentre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC). In particular,\nthis methodology is grounded on the fundamental principle of\naddressing security features from the very beginning of the\nconception and design of public locations, taking into account\ntheir inherent openness and integration to the overall urban\nlandscape. Its main goal is to facilitate towards balancing\nefforts to increase urban resilience, whilst promoting the open\nand inclusive character of the public sphere. However, the\n'Security-by-Design' concept exhibits two major drawbacks:"}, {"title": "II. DT IN SECURITY", "content": "The usage of DTs in the security domain has seen signif-\nicant advancements over the recent years, enhancing system\nperformance, safety and operational efficiency across various\napplications.

Use-case #1: Bomb attack at metro station", "content": "Aim: The main objective is to develop and to implement\neffective methods for the timely detection of bomb attacks and\nthe identification of the suspects involved. This requires the\ndevelopment of systems that can quickly recognize potential\nthreats and accurately determine the identity of individuals that\nmay be involved.\nMotivation: Public transportation stations/locations are typ-\nically characterized by high passenger density, especially dur-\ning peak travel hours. This crowd density, combined with the\nrapid movement of commuters, complicates security monitor-\ning efforts. Additionally, the dynamic and congested nature\nof such spaces makes it difficult to effectively observe and to\nrespond to potential security threats, underscoring the need for\nadvanced monitoring and detection measures.\nScenario: Attacks to public transportation infrastructure\n(e.g. metro stations) constitute attractive criminal goals, due\nto their potential for causing a high number of casualties,\nespecially during peak hours, and their relative easy acces-\nsibility. These attacks typically require significant planning\nand coordination. Perpetrators often conduct multiple recon-\nnaissance visits to the target location over multiple weeks,\ngathering detailed information about security measures, attack\nroutes and transportation schedules, as well as visual and\nmultimedia data to aid their planning. During the attack's\npreparation phase, criminals/terrorists may position themselves\nnear the target, waiting for the right moment and engaging in\nseemingly normal but actually preparatory behaviors, such as\nstanding in specific spots over unusually long periods. They\noften use mobile phones for communication, including calls\nand information exchange with accomplices. When the attack\noccurs, multiple suspects enter the metro station following\npredetermined routes, attempting to blend in with the crowd,\nwhile carrying suspicious objects (e.g. large bags containing\nexplosives). Despite their efforts to remain inconspicuous, their\nactions and appearances are captured by the station's CCTV\ncameras, which also monitor for abandoned items that could\npose a threat.\nMajor challenges: The following list of challenges, corre-\nsponding to functionalities/modules supported by the DTaaSS\narchitecture, needs to be addressed for tacking such a criminal\nattack:"}, {"title": "B. Use-case #2: Hybrid USV/UUV and shooting attack at leisure site", "content": "Aim: The main goal is to develop methods for the early\nidentification of abnormal activities, involving USVs and\nUUVs, as well as groups of suspects. This requires the devel-\nopment of systems that can effectively detect and differentiate\nbetween potentially threatening vehicles and ordinary vessels,\nas well as identifying suspicious human behaviors and objects.\nMotivation: Open-space leisure sites near sea-front locations\nare susceptible to attacks from multiple/different origins, in-\ncluding from the waterside.\nScenario: Attacks to popular and highly-crowded touris-\ntic/leisure sites near coastlines during peak season, where the\npotential for high casualties and media impact is significant,\nconstitutes a significant potential goal for criminals.

Use-case #3: Combined UAV and suicide attack during celebration ceremony at cathedral square", "content": "Aim: The primary goal is to develop effective methods for\nthe timely detection of abnormal activities, involving UAVs\nand individual suspects in crowded open-space religious sites.\nMotivation: Open-space religious sites, particularly during\ncrowded celebration ceremonies, present significant vulner-\nabilities to terrorist attacks. These events, often involving\nlarge gatherings of people, provide a strategic opportunity\nfor terrorists to inflict substantial harm and to spread their\nmessages. The high density of participants and the extensive\narea covered during such ceremonies make them susceptible\nto attacks from various origins and through different means.\nScenario: Celebration ceremonies, such as annual city-saint\nfestivities, provide terrorists with opportunities to maximize\ncasualties and to advance their agendas. UAVs, due to their\nversatility and low cost, can be exploited for malicious pur-\nposes, beyond their typical use for aerial footage captur-\ning. They pose a severe threat by potentially transporting\nexplosives discreetly into crowded areas, such as cathedral\nsquares.

However, the scarcity of higher-order datasets that capture the combinatorial effects of multiple drugs severely limits progress in this field. Existing resources such as TWOSIDES primarily focus on pairwise interactions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce HODDI, the first Higher-Order Drug-Drug Interaction Dataset, constructed from U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) records spanning the past decade, to advance computational pharmacovigilance. HODDI contains 109,744 records involving 2,506 unique drugs and 4,569 unique side effects, specifically curated to capture multi-drug interactions and their collective impact on adverse effects. Comprehensive statistical analyses demonstrate HODDI's extensive coverage and robust analytical metrics, making it a valuable resource for studying higher-order drug relationships. Evaluating HODDI with multiple models, we found that simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) can outperform graph models, while hypergraph models demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex multi-drug interactions, further validating HODDI's effectiveness.

Introduction", "content": "Clinical observations have revealed numerous cases in which drug combinations lead to unexpected adverse effects (Tekin et al., 2017; 2018). For instance, the concurrent use of multiple antibiotics with anticoagulants can significantly increase bleeding risks (Baillargeon et al., 2012), while the combination of various antidepressants may elevate the likelihood of serotonin syndrome (Quinn & Stern, 2009). These scenarios underscore the urgent need to investigate higher-order drug-drug interactions (Tekin et al., 2018), as understanding the intricate relationships between multiple drugs and their side effects is pivotal in pharmacology, forming the foundation for pharmacovigilance and drug safety studies (Tatonetti et al., 2012; Salas et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021). By elucidating these interactions, researchers can identify potential adverse effects early in the drug development process (Montastruc et al., 2006; Kompa et al., 2022), optimize drug design (Lipinski et al., 2012), mitigate polypharmacy risks (Luka\u010di\u0161in & Bollenbach, 2019), and advance personalized medicine (Molina, 2017) by helping clinicians tailor treatments to individual patient characteristics (Ryu et al., 2018). Nevertheless, current research faces two major challenges: the scarcity of datasets capturing complex, high-order drug-drug interactions (Zitnik et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017), and the limitations of existing computational methods in effectively modeling these high-order relationships (Masumshah et al., 2021; Sachdev & Gupta, 2020; Zakharov & Lagunin, 2014).\nSeveral existing datasets have been developed for the research of drug-side effect relationships. While these datasets are valuable resources, they have inherent limitations in capturing high-order drug interactions. SIDER (Kuhn et al., 2010; 2016) and OFFSIDES (Kumar et al., 2024) focus primarily on single-drug effects, while TWOSIDES (Tatonetti et al., 2012) advances to pairwise drug combinations. Despite being augmented by biological interaction networks (e.g., HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009), BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2007)), these datasets predominantly focus on single-drug or two-drug interactions, facing significant challenges in polypharmacy scenarios due to insufficient coverage of"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Existing Datasets. Several specialized medical datasets have been developed for studying drug-side effect relation-ships. SIDER (Kuhn et al., 2010; 2016) contains drug-side effect associations extracted from drug labels and public documents, serving as a foundational dataset of single drug documentation. Building upon this, OFFSIDES (Kumar et al., 2024) incorporates data from clinical trials, offer-ing more rigorous evidence. TWOSIDES (Tatonetti et al., 2012) further advances the data complexity by providing comprehensive information about drug combinations and their associated side effects derived from FAERS (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2024b;a), capturing real-world multi-drug interaction cases. These datasets are further augmented by protein-protein interaction networks from databases like HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), and drug-protein target interactions from STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2007), enabling researchers to construct multi-modal graphs for side ef-fect prediction in both single-drug and combination ther-apy scenarios (Zitnik et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2009; Ryu et al., 2018; Vilar & Hripcsak, 2017). While these datasets have achieved some success in characterizing drug-side ef-fect relationships, they face significant limitations in cap-turing higher-order interactions in polypharmacy scenar-ios. The challenges stem from three main aspects: Insufficient coverage of drug combinations, which limits our understanding of complex drug interactions; Inconsistent data quality across different sources (Ismail & Akram, 2022), which affects the reliability of predictions; and Data sparsity issues in polypharmacy settings, where the number of possible drug combinations grows exponentially while available data remains limited (Tekin et al., 2017; 2018).\nVarious computational methods have been developed for drug-side effect relationship prediction. Traditional ma-trix factorization approaches, such as Non-negative Ma-trix Factorization (NMF) (Lee & Seung, 1999) and Prob-abilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) (Jain et al., 2023), face challenges in computational complexity due to high-dimensional matrix operations (Jain et al., 2023), while tra-ditional machine learning methods struggled with model-ing complex non-linear relationships in drug-adverse effect interactions (Lee & Seung, 1999). Deep learning frame-works, such as the combination of Convolutional Neu-ral Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory net-works (LSTMs), while improving spatial and temporal fea-ture extraction capabilities, exhibit limitations in molecu-lar structure representation (Karim et al., 2019; Peng & Ji, 2024; Xu et al., 2018). Graph-based methods like Decagon and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) demonstrated promise by leveraging protein interaction networks (Zit-nik et al., 2018), but were primarily restricted to model-ing pairwise drug interactions (Zitnik et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2023). Due to the lack of specialized datasets captur-ing higher-order drug-adverse effect relationships, existing methods largely rely on datasets containing only pairwise drug interactions, fundamentally limiting their capability to model complex polypharmacy scenarios (Tekin et al., 2017; 2018)."}, {"title": "3.

The mapping between the standardized adverse event terminology (MedDRA terms) and their corresponding Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) were obtained from the UMLS Metathesaurus (uml). The cosine similarities were calculated between all embedding pairs of the side effect names from the original FAERS records and the stan-dardized MedDRA terms, with their embeddings generated using SapBERT. For each side effect name in the records, its recommended CUI was determined by identifying the standardized MedDRA term with the highest cosine sim-ilarity to its embedding. The cosine similarity thresholds of 0.8 and 0.9 were used to stratify the side effects based on their confidence levels, with the higher threshold value indicating the higher confidence of their classifications as recommended CUIs.

To eliminate data redundancy, we removed duplicate records and checked for superset relationships. For each record with a higher number of co-administered drugs, we examined whether its drug combination and as-sociated side effects completely overlapped with those in records containing fewer drugs. If such complete over-lap was found, we removed the superset record to main-tain the most parsimonious representation of drug-side ef-fect associations across the dataset spanning 41 quarters"}, {"title": "Negative Sample Construction.", "content": "Negative samples rep-resent drug combinations that have not been reported to cause the specific adverse events in clinical records or are unlikely to trigger such adverse events based on their known pharmacological properties.

An equal number of positive and negative samples were gener-ated, which helps maintain the class balance in the HODDI dataset and prevents model bias during training, ensuring that the model would not favor predicting one class over an-other, and improving its generalization capability and pre-diction accuracy.

This marked shift suggests evolving patterns in drug interaction report-ing over time. The cosine similarity analysis revealed gen-erally high reliability in side effect recommendations, with 90% of the 470,144 total CUI matches having similarities greater than 0.9. However, we also note that the propor-tion of low-confidence matches (similarity < 0.8) gradually increased from around 3-4% in early periods to 8-10% in recent quarters. This trend points to growing complexity in standardizing side effect terminology. Our findings high-light the typical temporal trends in the HODDI dataset, with notable changes in the distribution of drug role con-ditions and a slight decline in recommendation reliability over the study period. Further research is warranted to un-derstand the factors driving these shifts and their implica-tions for drug interaction surveillance.\nTo facilitate efficient model evaluation, we constructed three evaluation subsets from the HODDI dataset using the following criteria (excluding low-frequency cases), with their statistical details summarized in Table 5:\nEvaluation Subset 1: 21,503 sample pairs where each record contains 2-8 drugs, and each side effect appears for 5-50 times;\nEvaluation Subset 2: 24,777 sample pairs where each record contains 2-16 drugs, and each side effect appears for 5-50 times;\nEvaluation Subset 3: 38,430 sample pairs where each record contains 2-16 drugs, and each side effect appears for 5-100 times.\nFor simplicity, we selected Evaluation Subset 1 as our evaluation set for HODDI dataset utility evaluation across graph- and non-graph-based models."}, {"title": "Evaluation Set Conversion.", "content": "To evaluate the HODDI dataset's applicability to GNN-based models, we imple-mented the clique expansion method for the evaluation set conversion, due to its superior ability to capture the drug interaction patterns, despite higher computational demands (Klamt et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2006). During evalua-tion set conversion, each hyperedge was converted into a complete subgraph where every pair of nodes within the hyperedge is connected by an edge, inheriting the hyper-edge's properties (report ID, side effect names with rec-ommended ULMS CUIs, and the record time).

Even basic architectures such as MLP can de-liver robust performance when leveraging higher-order fea-tures from our dataset, surpassing more complex models like GAT. The hypergraph architectures, such as HyGNN (Saifuddin et al., 2023) and the HGNN-SA we designed, take this a step further by enhancing prediction accuracy through its ability to better model intricate multi-drug relationships.\nWe conducted a comprehensive evaluation on our evalua-tion set across different architectural paradigms. We ran-domly selected 29, 6, and 6 quarters as the training, valida-tion, and test data, respectively, with an approximate ratio of 70:15:15. Detailed experimental configurations, includ-ing hyperparameter settings, training protocols, and hard-ware specifications, are provided in Appendix A.4. The comparative results of the model performance are illus-trated in Table 7. Multiple evaluation metrics were em-ployed to assess our model performance, including Preci-sion, F1 score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Charac-teristic curve (AUC), and Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (PRAUC).\nCompared with GCN and GAT, MLP achieves higher over-all performance across all metrics, with a precision of 80.5%, an F1 score of 81.9%, an AUC of 89.7%, and a PRAUC of 87.2%. This suggests that even a simple feed-forward architecture can effectively leverage the higher-order feature representations provided by HODDI, high-lighting the dataset's well-structured and informative na-ture. Among the GNN models, GAT and GCN demonstrate comparable performance. While GAT achieves a higher F1 score (80.9% vs. 77.8%) and AUC (85.1% vs. 82.9%) compared to GCN, the latter performs better in terms of F1 score and PRAUC. That means that HODDI is well-suited for both the MLP model and GNN models.\nBy leveraging hypergraph architectures, HyGNN and HGNN-SA, which effectively capture higher-order rela-tionships in drug-side effect interactions, the results can be significantly improved. The HGNN-SA outperforms all other approaches, achieving a precision of 90.6%, an F1 score of 93.3%, an AUC of 95.7%, and a PRAUC of 93.9%. These results demonstrate that HGNN-based mod-els which explicitly integrate hypergraph structures can ef-fectively leverage the higher-order drug-drug interaction relationships captured in our HODDI dataset.\nAdditionally, the low standard deviations across all mod-els (ranging from 0.1% to 4.6%) indicate robust and stable learning behavior, further validating the dataset's reliability for capturing the interaction between drugs and side effects.

Asadujjaman", "Md. Mahfujur Rahman", "Abdullah Tamim"], "abstract": "Skin diseases can arise from infections, allergies, genetic factors, autoimmune disorders, hormonal imbalances, or environmental triggers such as sun damage and pollution. Skin diseases such as Actinic Keratosis and Psoriasis can be fatal. These are treatable if identified early. However, its diagnostic methods are expensive and not widely accessible. In this study, a novel and efficient method for diagnosing skin diseases using deep learning techniques has been proposed. This approach employs a modified VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model includes several convolutional layers. The VGG16 model has been employed using ImageNet weights and modified top layers. The top layer is modified by fully connected layers and a final softmax activation layer to obtain the result. The dataset analyzed is publicly available and titled \"Skin Disease Dataset\". The VGG16 architecture does not include augmentation by default; data augmentation is typically performed through rotation, shifting, and zooming during preprocessing prior to model training. The proposed methodology achieved 90.67% accuracy using the modified VGG16 model, demonstrating reliability in classifying skin diseases. The modified pre-trained model showed promising results, increasing its potential for real-world applications.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have transformed dermatology by offering innovative methods for diagnosing, classifying, and treating skin diseases. Inspired by human brain architecture, ANNs efficiently manage complex data sets and interpret visual information, making them valuable for dermatological diagnoses.\n\nThe skin covers the body and serves essential functions, including protection from physical, chemical, and biological threats. Skin diseases are common health issues faced by underprivileged populations in many countries [1]. WHO estimates that approximately 1.8 billion individuals are affected by skin diseases at any given time [2]. Skin diseases may result in skin cancer. Annually, 2 to 3 million non-melanoma skin cancers and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers are diagnosed worldwide [3]. The impact of disorders is influenced by climate, economic conditions, literacy levels, and the cultural and social lifestyles of communities across different geographic areas. Bangladesh experiences a high occurrence due to its humid climate and growing population. Many patients pursue treatment late due to a lack of awareness about the disease. In 2020, skin disease caused 1,131 deaths in Bangladesh, representing 0.16% of total deaths [4], with a prevalence rate of 11.16-63% among the population [5].\n\nDermatology now incorporates artificial neural networks to analyze various data, including patient history, symptoms, laboratory test results, and crucially, images or scans of skin lesions. ANN can recognize complex patterns and features effectively. The ANN classifies, diagnoses, and predicts skin diseases with high accuracy."}, {"title": "II. RELATED STUDY", "content": "Six techniques-Balanced Random Forest, Balanced Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Balanced Bagging & SVM-were evaluated using a dataset of 2,453 images. Dermoscopic images of skin diseases, including melanoma, melanocytosis, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), actinic keratosis (AK), seborrheic keratosis (SK), and nevi (moles), have been used to train this model.\n\nA recent study by Van-Dung Hoang et al. found that the EfficientNetB4-CLF model achieved an accuracy of 89.97%, a recall of 86.13%, and a false positive rate of 0.39%. DenseNet 169 outperforms EfficientNetB4 in image classification. ImageNet supplied the pre-trained network to CNNs. CyclicLR was employed to adjust the learning rate periodically. Backpropagation updated the weight values in the CNN architecture. It used 24,530 images resized to 256x192px, allocated as 10% test data, 80% training data, and 10% validation data [6].

METHODOLOGY", "content": "A. Dataset and Experiment:\nWe utilized the \"Skin Disease Dataset,\" comprising a total of 2,400 photos across all categories. This dataset is evenly distributed and balanced. The dataset comprises photos from three classes, each containing a total of 800 samples. The dataset has been partitioned into two segments: test data and training data. The test dataset has 150 photos per class, representing 18.8% of the total data for that class, while the training dataset contains 650 images per class, accounting for 81.2% of the total data for that class. Our dataset can be obtained from public resources labeled \"Skin Disease Dataset,\" which has thousands of data entries [11].\n\nMoreover, the model's learning process necessitates meticulous attention to data quality and parameter optimization to attain optimal outcomes. Our methodology exclusively focuses on the detection and classification of dermatological conditions. \n\nB. Training Model:\na) Deep Transfer Learning Model (VGG16): The essential elements of every CNN model comprise convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, fully connected layers, and an output loss layer. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are distinguished for their outstanding efficacy in visual and natural language tasks. VGG16, created by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, is a prominent convolutional neural network architecture. Feature extraction in VGG16 involves employing the network to recognize and specify the most salient characteristics from input images.\n\nThe VGG16 architecture exhibits a simple and efficient design, with 16 weight layers, 13 convolutional layers, and 3 fully connected layers.\n\nThe classification head has been modified for the proposed VGG16 architecture. The revised head has two interconnected dense layers with 1024 and 512 units, respectively, with a dropout rate of 0.5, succeeded by a final softmax layer with 3 nodes for classification output. The VGG16 was primarily developed to examine the influence of depth on deep neural networks employed for image classification applications.\n\nHere is an overview of the VGG16 architecture:\nInput Layer: VGG16 accepts a fixed-size RGB image with dimensions of 150x150 pixels as input.\nConvolutional Blocks: It comprises 13 convolutional layers, achieving efficacy using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) operation. In convolutional layers, tiny filters measuring 3x3 pixels utilize a stride of 1, whereas max pooling layers employ 2x2 filters with a stride of 2 for down sampling.\nFully Connected Layers: The subsequent three layers are totally joined. The initial two fully-connected layers consist of 4,096 neurons each. The third consists of 1,000 neurons, corresponding to each of the 1,000 ImageNet classes.\nActivation Functions: The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is efficient in convolutional neural networks"}, {"title": "IV.

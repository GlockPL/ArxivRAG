Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence, resulting in inaccurate disease coding and a lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes. Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to convert descriptions of disease diagnoses and other health problems into an alphanumeric coding system. ICD codes are widely accepted and used in numerous countries for clinical research, healthcare management, and insurance compensation. Electronic medical records (EMRs) systems have recently gained popularity among healthcare organizations worldwide as a viable alternative to traditional paper-based record management. The streamlined storage of ICD codes has facilitated the generation of a substantial volume of medical data by EMR systems annually, often containing valuable medical insights [1]. While initially developed as archival systems for medical records, researchers have made the compelling discovery that these systems offer valuable support across a diverse range of clinical and statistical applications [2].\nWhile automatic ICD coding has received considerable attention [1], [3]\u2013[6], there has been limited validation of its effectiveness on Chinese EMR datasets, as most studies have relied on English datasets (such as various versions of the MIMIC dataset) [1], [3]. Consequently, there is a lack of research focusing on the challenges and practical requirements of Chinese EMRs. In light of this, we emphasize two unresolved issues in this context.\nThe first challenge in automatically coding the ICD from Chinese EMRs lies in extracting disease-related information due to their concise writing style and unique structure. Unlike English EMRS (e.g., MIMIC-III dataset [7]), where diagnosis-related information is often conveyed in brief sentences and essential coding details are included in discharge summaries, Chinese EMRs present diagnoses in multi-word phrases and offer less detailed discharge summaries. We performed a statistical analysis on diagnostic descriptions and discharge summaries from a Chinese dataset and the MIMIC-III dataset to substantiate these points. As shown in Table I, the analysis revealed significant discrepancies: the average length of diagnoses in the MIMIC-III dataset is 14.73 words, compared to just 3.74 in Chinese EMRs-making them nearly four times shorter. Discharge summaries too showed a marked difference, with MIMIC-III averaging around 1,600 words and Chinese EMRs only 731 words, around 2.19 times shorter. This data underscores the inadequacy of depending solely on diagnosis names and summaries for coding in Chinese EMRs. The additional diagnostic and treatment information required is dispersed throughout various sections of the EMR, necessitating a comprehensive approach using axis knowledge for retrieval.\nThe second issue with previous ICD coding methods is their focus on the hierarchical structure of ICD codes while neglecting the essential multi-axial knowledge that underpins this hierarchy [8], [9]. This multi-axial knowledge is vital, much like the nuanced perspective in a poem. Using the example of ICD code H31.403 from the Chinese medical insurance version (as depicted in Fig 1), the left diagram illustrates how diseases and health conditions are organized into codes across four axes: etiology, anatomical site, pathology, and clinical manifestations. This organization involves progressively narrowing down from broader categories to more specific ones, thus forming the structure of the ICD coding system. The right diagram further highlights that each segment of the code corresponds to specific knowledge relevant to its axis. Yet, previous approaches have overlooked this crucial aspect by: 1) ignoring the important multi-axial knowledge in favor of simply mapping hierarchical structures, and 2) treating all diagnostic and treatment information homogeneously without aligning them with the clinical evidence that pertains to relevant axis knowledge [8]\u2013[10]. This oversight leads to coding that not only lacks accuracy but also falls short in interpretability, posing challenges for practical implementation in real-world scenarios.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we have developed MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD Coding for Chinese EMR, as depicted in Fig 2. This framework is inspired by the utilization of multi-axial knowledge in the ICD coding system and the principles of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) [11]\u2013[13]. EBM, which has its roots in the late 19th century, emphasizes the conscious and rational utilization of the best available scientific evidence when making treatment decisions for individual patients. It involves the conscientious, explicit, judicious, and reasonable application of the most current and reliable evidence in determining the care provided to each patient [11]. In our framework, we aim to find evidence for the knowledge under each axis of the candidate codes and use this evidence to determine whether a candidate code is well-supported. This process enables us to recommend codes that are strongly supported by the evidence gathered.\nSpecifically, our approach involves several steps. First, we extract the diagnosis list from the Chinese EMR. Next, we identify the most probable candidate ICD codes for each diagnosis to enhance efficiency. To parse the multi-axial knowledge associated with each candidate code, we employ a multi-axial parser. Additionally, we utilize an evidence retrieval module that leverages prior knowledge from ICD coders to locate supporting text descriptions within the EMR for each axis of the candidate code. To ensure the reliability of the retrieved evidence, we propose a Clinical-Simbert model that calculates the similarity between each piece of evidence and the corresponding knowledge under the axis. Once we have obtained a reliable set of evidence, we need to determine whether the ICD code is fully supported by the evidence set and worthy of recommendation. Inspired by the prompt tuning method, which effectively bridges the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning downstream tasks [14], [15], we adopt a prompt-tuning approach. This involves designing a template that combines evidence from all axes and the candidate ICD code. We then convert the binary classification task into a masked language modeling problem and conduct supervised training. Finally, we obtain the recommended ICD code for each diagnosis, along with the corresponding evidence set. This comprehensive framework enables efficient and accurate ICD coding for Chinese EMR data. We summarize the contribution of this paper as follows:\n\u2022 We point out the differences between Chinese EMRs and English EMRs in extracting ICD coding-dependent information. Chinese EMR datasets have an average diagnosis length that is 3.9 times shorter than the MIMIC dataset, and the average length of discharge summaries in Chinese EMR datasets is 2.19 times shorter than in the MIMIC dataset. Therefore, the previous ICD automatic coding method focused on English EMRs does not apply to Chinese EMRs.\n\u2022 Inspired by the coarse-to-fine classification strategy under multi-axes knowledge of the ICD codes system and the theory of evidence-based medicine, we proposed an evidence retrieve module to find out the textual description in the EMR supporting the knowledge under the axis of each candidate ICD code, and further evaluate the quality of evidence to ensure its reliable by proposed Clinical-Simbert model;\n\u2022 We convert the binary classification task of whether the candidate ICD code can be fully supported by the evidence set into a masked language modeling problem by designing a template that combines the proof set and the candidate ICD code. We conducted ICD code prediction experiments on the Chinese dataset collected and obtained state-of-the-art performance. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "The task of automatically coding ICD in the medical field has been well established and has received much attention. Many deep-learning methods have been used to address this problem, and we categorize these methods into the following three types.\nA. Knowledge-Enhanced Methods\nA comprehensive understanding of clinical notes necessitates expertise in the field of medicine. Various techniques leverage external knowledge sources to optimize neural architectures and facilitate the comprehension of clinical text, ultimately enhancing proficiency in accurately assigning ICD codes. Yuan et al. proposed the MSMN method, which collected synonyms of every ICD code from UMLS and designed a multiple synonyms matching network to leverage synonyms for better code classification [5]. Similarly, Yang et al. proposed a knowledge-enhanced longformer by injecting three domain-specific knowledge: hierarchy, synonym, and abbreviation with additional pretraining using contrastive learning [16]. Li et al. highlighted the often overlooked issues of data imbalance and noise in clinical notes, thus they suggested a knowledge-enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT [17]) under a multi-task learning setting, featuring multi-level information transitions and interactions [6].\nB. Graph Neural Networks\nGraph neural networks are adept at transforming complex relationships into topological graph structures and then leveraging graph convolution operations to facilitate low or high-dimensional interactions between nodes and relationships, which has led to their successful application and impressive results in many NLP tasks [18]\u2013[21]. To mitigate the issues of excessive and imbalanced ICD codes, which present a severe long-tail distribution, and to fully exploit the hierarchical structure among the codes, graph neural networks have been extensively applied to automatic ICD coding tasks. Jeong et al. introduced a novel approach, the Joint Learning Framework Across Medical Coding Systems (JAMS). This framework utilized a modified version of the Graph Attention Network, termed the Medical Code Attention Network, to facilitate multi-task learning, enabling simultaneous learning from various coding systems through a shared encoder to acquire diverse representations [10]. Meanwhile, Wu et al. highlighted the primary challenges of automated ICD coding, including imbalanced label distribution, code hierarchy, and noisy texts. In response, they proposed a unique approach called the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network [22] with Contrastive Learning [23]. They employed a Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Network to capture the hierarchical structure of ICD codes and implemented contrastive learning to automatically assign ICD codes, incorporating code features into a text encoder [8]. In a study by Fails et al., the researchers proposed data augmentation and synthesis techniques and also introduced an analysis technique for this setting inspired by confusion matrices [24]. Recognizing that existing methods could not model a personalized relation graph for each case, or discover implicit code relations, Luo et al. presented a novel contextualized code relation-enhanced ICD coding framework. This framework utilized a personalized flexible relation graph, enabling their model to learn implicit relations [9].\nC. Pretrained Language Models\nPretrained language models are trained on an auxiliary task, such as masked language modeling that predicts a word or sequence based on the surrounding context and gains improvement in many NLP tasks [25]. Pretraining such auxiliary tasks benefits from large-scale training on unlabeled corpora that are readily available from the web or textbooks [26]. For electronic health records that ICD coding is based on, language models that have been pre-trained in the medical field can effectively understand their specialized medical semantic information. As such, they are extensively employed in ICD coding tasks. A series of competitive frameworks for automatic ICD coding is based on the Bert method [4], [27], [28], in which each ICD code is associated with a unique entity representation, and the automatic coding task is transformed into a multi-label classification across fine-tuning. Afkanpour et al. presented a simple and scalable method to process long electronic medical records (EMRs) with the existing transformer models such as BERT, showed that this method significantly improves the previous results reported for transformer models in ICD coding, and can outperform one of the prominent CNN-based methods [29]. Gomes et al. employed a strong Transformer-based model as a text encoder and, to handle lengthy clinical narratives, explored either (a) adapting the base encoder model into a Longformer [30], or (b) dividing the text into chunks and processing each chunk independently [31]. Silva et al. proposed a method where Cosine text similarity is combined with a pretrained language model, PLM-ICD, to increase the number of probably useful suggestions of ICD-10 codes, based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset [32].\nPrompt-based fine-tuning is effective in few-shot tasks [33], [34], even when the language model is relatively small [35] because they introduce no new parameter during few-shot fine-tuning. Yang et al. proposed a Knowledge Enhanced PrompT (KEPT) framework that utilized prompt-tuning in the context of ICD coding tasks by adding a sequence of ICD code descriptions as prompts in addition to each"}, {"title": "D. Summary", "content": "In summary, while automatic ICD coding has received significant attention, there has been limited validation of its effectiveness on Chinese EMR datasets. Consequently, a lack of research specifically focuses on the unique challenges and practical requirements of Chinese EMRs. Notably, existing methods have neglected to extract disease code-related information from Chinese EMRS and have overlooked the crucial multi-axial knowledge that underpins the ICD coding hierarchy. As a result, the outcomes of the Chinese ICD coding system suffer from insufficient coding accuracy and a lack of genuine interpretability, posing challenges to their effective implementation in real-world scenarios. Therefore, our work is motivated by these issues and proposes a novel framework that addresses the challenges of ICD coding in Chinese EMRS. Our framework considers the specific characteristics of Chinese EMRs, focusing on extracting multi-axial knowledge-related information. By doing so, we aim to improve coding accuracy and enhance interpretability, enabling effective system implementation in real-world scenarios."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "Recently, reducing a multi-label to a set of binary classification problems has proved competitive to more sophisticated multi-label classification methods, and still achieves state-of-the-art performance for many loss functions [37]. Inspired by this, We take the automatic ICD coding task as a set of binary classification tasks based on diagnoses and multi-axial knowledge-related information from EMR. Given an EMR, we first determine the Top N candidate ICD codes for each diagnosis $d\\in D$. Then we find out the reliable supporting evidence set $E_{d,c_i} = \\{s^1,s^2,...,s^Q\\}$ for knowledge under the multi-axis of $i^{th}$ candidate ICD code $c_i$ by evidence retrieving and evaluating, where Q indices the maximum number of evidence, $s^j$ indices the jth reliable evidence sentence for $c_i$. We determine whether the ICD code is fully supported by the evidence set. That is, we take the description of $c_i$ and its corresponding evidence set $E_{d,c_i}$ organized in template form as input. And assign a binary label $y_i\\in \\{0,1\\}$ for the ith candidate ICD code in the label space Y, where 1 means that the evidence sufficiently supports the ICD code and to be recommended, 0 is the opposite.\nB. Evidence Retrieval and Evaluation\n1) Obtaining Candidate Codes for Each Diagnosis: Let D be the set of all diagnoses from the dataset of medical records, and C is the set of all ICD codes. For each diagnosis $d\\in D$, we calculate the similarity with all ICD codes using a weighted sum of the Edit-Distance score (ED) [38], TF-IDF score (TF), and word2vec-based [39] feature similarity score (FEA). They quantify the characteristics at the character, discriminative and semantic level. The top N candidate codes $C_d$ for each diagnosis d are obtained by:\n$C_d = TopN\\{c/Sort(Sim(d, c)), \\forall c \\in C'\\}$  (1)\n$Sim(d, c) = w_1\\cdot ED(d, c) + w_2 TF(d, c) + w_3 FEA(d, c)$ (2)\nWhere Sort denotes indices sorting in descending order, and $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ represent the corresponding weights, which are set as 0.35, 0.35, and 0.3 in our experiment.\n2) Greedy Evidence Retrieve based on Prior Knowledge: Due to the excessive number of sections and lengthy content in Chinese EMRs, the efficiency of evidence retrieval based on axis-specific knowledge throughout the entire medical record is low. To address this issue, we have developed an index table that leverages the prior knowledge of doctors and ICD coders to accelerate the retrieval process. Specifically, the ICD coding system divides all codes into 212 categories at the three-digit level [40]. Through discussions with ICD coding specialists and doctors, we have identified 88 potential locations in Chinese EMRs where coding-related evidence may be found. We asked experienced ICD coders to identify the probable locations of supporting evidence in the medical record for each category of ICD three-digit codes. A prior information table was formed as a result of this process. For example, to confirm the diagnosis of intestinal infectious diseases, the testing and results, symptom presentation, and history of exposure to endemic or epidemic areas are considered. Therefore, the potential evidence may appear in these three positions. A condensed table of prior knowledge is provided in Table II.\nUndoubtedly, the evidence sentence that contains more knowledge keywords is considered to be more representative and reliable. Therefore, we have designed a greedy evidence retrieval method. Let $K_{d,c_i}$ be the set of knowledge words under multi-axes for each candidate code $c_i \\in C_d$ for each diagnosis d, obtained by a pre-trained parser. In addition, the MSMN method [5] has verified that rich synonym descriptions can be more effective in ICD coding, therefore we use synonyms for these keywords as a supplement, denoted as $Syn(K_{d,c_i})$. The set of all possible locations where evidence may appear in the medical record, as determined by the prior knowledge table above, is denoted as $L_{d,c_i}$\nWe define a function g(l, s) that returns the number of keywords in sentence s at location l:\n$g(l, s) = |s \\cap (K_{d,c_i} \\cup Syn(K_{d,c_i}))|$ (3)\nFor each location $l \\in L_{d,c_i}$, we take the sentence $s_{d,l}$, containing the most keywords from $K_{d,c_i} \\cup Syn(K_{d,c_i})$:\n$s_{d,l} = argmax \\ g(l, s)$ (4)\n$s\\in l$\nLet $S_{d,c_i}$ be the set of sentences retrieved for diagnosis d and candidate code $c_i$. Initially, $S_{d,c_i} = \\emptyset$, we sort all possible combinations of all keywords in $K_{d,c_i} \\cup Syn(K_{d,c_i})$ in descending order by the number of elements. Then, we use these sorted keyword subsets as keys to iteratively conduct the retrieval process, ensuring a comprehensive search. For each keyword, we choose the sentence $s_{d,l}$ that not only contains the keyword but also includes the maximum number of other keywords:\n$S_{d,c_i} = S_{d,c_i} \\cup \\{s_{d,l}|g(l, s_{d,l}) > g(l, s), \\forall s \\in S_{d,c_i}, \\forall l \\in L_{d,c}\\}$ (5)\nWe stop retrieving when all keywords in $K_{d,c_i} \\cup Syn(K_{d,c_i})$ have been covered by sentences in $S_{d,c_i}$ or all positions have been retrieved.\n3) Reliability Assessment of Multiple Axes' Evidence: The reliability of evidence is evaluated using an evidence-scoring model called Clinical-Simber. This model is trained in two phases using the Simbert framework [41] and a prepared medical corpus. In the first training phase, a pre-training mode is employed. Sentence pairs with over 60% matching entities are selected as positive samples from the same sections of several electronic medical records (EMRs) of the same disease category. Negative samples are obtained from different sections of EMRs from various disease categories, with less than 10% matching entities. After the first pre-training phase, the model gains improved representation capabilities for Chinese medical sentences. The second training phase incorporates a contrastive learning framework to train the model's ability to score pairs of \"multi-axes knowledge-evidence\" sentences. Positive samples consist of pairs that include multi-axes knowledge and corresponding retrieved evidence sentences. Negative samples consist of pairs that do not correspond to the knowledge and evidence. After these two training phases, Clinical-Simber can assess the reliability of evidence for knowledge based on ICD codes. We denote the similarity score between each retrieved sentence $s_{d,l}$ and the set of knowledge keywords $k_{d,l}$ across multiple axes as $Score(s_{d,l},k_{d,l})$. If the score falls below a certain threshold T, we remove $s_{d,l}$ from the evidence set:\n$E_{d,c_i} = \\{s_{d,l}|Score(s_{d,l}, k_{d,l}) > T\\}$ (6)\nThis process is iterated for each candidate ICD code to obtain the respective sets of reliable evidence $E_{d,c_i}$. The detailed algorithm pseudocode of evidence Retrieval and reliability assessment is given in Algorithm 1. As shown in Fig 3(a), we give two examples of\nC. Inference Based on Prompt-Tuning Method\nInspired by the successful application of the prompt tuning method, which effectively bridges the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning for downstream tasks [14], [15], we propose a new approach to address the binary classification task of determining whether a candidate ICD code can be fully supported by the evidence set. To achieve this, we transform the task into a masked language modeling problem, leveraging the benefits of this technique. The effectiveness of our method heavily relies on the design of the template, as previous research has shown that the template design plays a crucial role in determining the method's success [33]\u2013[36]. In this section, we will introduce the importance of template design and its impact on the prediction process. We will delve into the details of how our approach leverages the masked language modeling framework to make accurate predictions.\n1) EMR Prior for Template Design: Through our observations of Chinese electronic medical records and communication with many professional ICD coders and clinicians, we have summarized two EMR prior for writing Chinese EMRs, which will help in designing the template for prompt tuning.\nEMR Prior 1: The source of the evidence limits what the evidence can describe and how credible it is.\nWhen analyzing medical records, it's crucial to consider the source of evidence, as it directly impacts the information provided and its overall credibility. For example, comparing past and present histories in the medical record, the former records pre-hospitalization conditions while the latter captures current health status, making it less reliable for assessing the patient's present condition. On the other hand, comparing the present history with auxiliary examination results reveals a contrast between subjective descriptions and objective facts. Based on a doctor's interpretation of the patient's self-description, the present history can be unreliable due to variations in patient perception and differences in doctor expertise. For instance, a patient with heart disease might misinterpret and report symptoms as back pain. In contrast, auxiliary examination results offer more objective and accurate information. Therefore, integrating the evidence source containing crucial information into the template is essential.\nEMR Prior 2: The number of repeating times of one piece of evidence in the Chinese EMR determines its importance\nEach step of the treatment plan heavily relies on the patient's fundamental diagnostic basis and auxiliary examination results, often recorded repeatedly in the medical record. To manage this redundancy, we apply the k-means method to cluster and retain only one sentence from sets of duplicate or highly similar evidence retrieved through certain keywords. Concurrently, we tally the number of similar descriptions in each cluster and incorporate this count into the template. This procedure not only eliminates repetition but also highlights the significance of each sentence by indicating its frequency.\nFinally, because each piece of evidence is to prove the knowledge of the corresponding axis, we emphasize them by adding the keywords behind the evidence. We presented the compositional structure of a reliable evidence piece in Fig3(b) to aid in clear understanding.\n2) Template Design: We give the formal definition of the template. Given the ith candidate ICD code description $c_i$ of diagnosis d, the corresponding reliable evidence set is $E_{d,c_i}$ is defined by:\n$E_{d,c_i} = \\{s^1,s^2,...,s^Q\\}$ (7)\nwhere $s^q$ indices the qth evidence of candidate ICD code $c_i$, Q indices the maximum number of evidence. Each piece of evidence $s_q^i$ is defined by:\n$s_q^i = s_{d,l}||k_{d,l}||o_{sa}||t_{ea}$ (8)\nwhere $k_{d,l}$ indicate the keywords of $s_{d,l}$, $o_{sa}$ and $t_{ea}$ indicate the field of the sentence originates from and the repeating times the evidence in the whole Chinese EMR, '||' represents concatenation. Both $c_i$ and its reliable evidence set $E_{d,c_i}$ are all composed of words, we represent them in this way:\n$c_i = \\{w_1^{c_i}, w_2^{c_i}, ..., w_P^{c_i}\\}$ (9)\nwhere $w_p^{c_i}$ indices pth word of candidate ICD code $c_i$ and P indices the maximum number of words.\n$E_{d,c_i} = \\{w_{1,1}^{i,1},...,w_{q,1}^{i,1}, ..., w_{1,R}^{i,Q}, ..., w_{q,R}^{i,Q}\\}$ (10)\nwhere $w_{q,r}^{i,q}$ indicate the rth word in qth evidence of cith candidate ICD code, and R indices the maximum number of words. We designed the template as follows:\n$T = [CLS]E_{d,c_i} [soft][soft][soft]c_i[soft][mask]$ (11)\nIn which [soft] indices a learnable continuous embedding, which is a trick to eliminate the trouble of designing prompts and can get better results than designing templates manually proposed by [42], [43]. We use a [mask] token for label prediction, indicating a binary classification label prediction. The inference framework is shown in Fig 4.\n3) Evidence-Based ICD Codes Prediction: Raffel et al. proposed T5 model, which is a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format [44]. We employed this model as a text encoder, which embeds input tokens to embedding space:\n$T = [e_{w_{1,1}^{i,1}}...e_{w_{q,R}^{i,Q}}, e_{soft}, e_{soft}, e_{soft}, e_{w_1^{c_i}}..., e_{w_P^{c_i}}, e_{soft}, e_{mask}]$ (12)\nwhere $e_{w_{q,r}^{i,q}}$ is word embedding of $w_{q,r}^{i,q}$, $e_{soft}$ is the embedding of [soft], which is initialized following the T5 model. $e_{mask}$ is the embedding of [mask], which is initialized by the [mask] token by T5 model. We've deleted [cls] for brevity. T5 model then encodes T to achieve the hidden states:\n$T = [h_{w_{1,1}^{i,1}}...h_{w_{q,R}^{i,Q}}, h_{soft}, h_{soft}, h_{soft}, h_{w_1^{c_i}}..., h_{w_P^{c_i}}, h_{soft}, h_{mask}]$ (13)\nTo convert the binary classification task into a masked language modeling problem, we calculate the probability of filling the token to the [mask] position in the template. Let V and Y indices a set of label words and class set respectively. An injective mapping function $\\phi: Y \\rightarrow V$ is needed to associate the label set with the set of label words, which is also called \"verbalizer\" in some recent papers [42], [45]. We define a sample verbalizer by setting $V_1 = \\text{\u201cyes\u201d}, V_0 = \\text{\u201cno\u201d}$. With the verbalizer, the probability distribution of Y can be obtained by the probability distribution of V at the [mask] position, which is formalized as follows:\n$p(y/T) = p([mask] = \\phi(y)|T)$ (14)"}, {"title": "IV.

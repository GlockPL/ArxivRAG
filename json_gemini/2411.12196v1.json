{"title": "A More Advanced Group Polarization Measurement Approach Based on LLM-Based Agents and Graphs", "authors": ["Zixin Liu", "Ji Zhang", "Yiran Ding"], "abstract": "Group polarization is an important research direction in social media content analysis, attracting many researchers to explore this field. Therefore, how to effectively measure group polarization has become a critical topic. Measuring group polarization on social media presents several challenges that have not yet been addressed by existing solutions. First, social media group polarization measurement involves processing vast amounts of text, which poses a significant challenge for information extraction. Second, social media texts often contain hard-to-understand content, including sarcasm, memes, and internet slang. Additionally, group polarization research focuses on holistic analysis, while texts is typically fragmented. To address these challenges, we designed a solution based on a multi-agent system and used a graph-structured Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent polarization states. Furthermore, we developed a metric called Community Opposition Index (COI) based on the CSN to quantify polarization. Finally, we tested our multi-agent system through a zero-shot stance detection task and achieved outstanding results. In summary, the proposed approach has significant value in terms of usability, accuracy, and interpretability.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "With the development of internet technology, social media has gained widespread popularity. GLOBAL DIGITAL REPORT [11] indicate that platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok boast billions of users worldwide. Social media has become a key avenue for the public to express opinions and engage in discussions. Its anonymity and convenience enable users to freely express their true views, thereby shaping social media public opinion. As a result, research in this field has also flourished.\nIn these studies, research from the perspective of group polarization holds a significant position. The concept of group polarization was first introduced by Stoner [37], who observed that group decisions tend to be more extreme compared to individual decisions [16]. In the internet era, group polarization is broadly defined as the divergence of public opinions or stances. Building on"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "To address the existing issues in measuring group polarization and improve efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability, we propose a new group polarization measurement approach based on LLM-based agents and graphs. This approach draws inspiration from the stance detection task in natural language processing (NLP) and the earlier \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. We use a Community Sentiment Network (CSN) represented by a graph structure to model the polarization state, where LLM-based agents are employed to construct the network. Additionally, we design polarization measurement metrics based on CSN. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we tested the module responsible for constructing CSN on zero-shot stance detection tasks, and the results demonstrated its superiority in capturing the nuances of group polarization.\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: (1) We propose a temporal Community Sentiment Network (CSN) to represent the polarization state over time. (2) We introduce LLM-based Agents for stance detection into group polarization measurement, significantly enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. (3) We propose a more robust metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition Index (COI)."}, {"title": "2.1 Opinion Polarization Measurement", "content": "As research on group polarization deepens, extensive exploration has also been conducted on the measurement of group polarization, leading to the development of a relatively comprehensive system of measurement approaches. Existing research [5,20] suggests that the current mainstream group polarization measurement schemes can be primarily divided into three categories: volume-based, sentiment-based, and network-based. We will discuss the characteristics of these three measurement schemes and their shortcomings when applied to the task of measuring group polarization on social media.\nVolume-based approaches primarily rely on statistical methods and were widely applied in the early research of group polarization. Early researchers collected data through surveys and experiments and used statistical analysis to obtain relevant polarization results. In current trend of exploring group polarization via social media, volume-based schemes focus more on various data metrics"}, {"title": "2.2 LLM-Based Agents", "content": "With the introduction of OpenAI's GPT series of large language models (LLMs) [9], numerous research fields have incorporated or examined GPT's capabilities. In the realm of group polarization research, some researchers have also explored its applications. For instance, Lu et al. [31] used agent-based simulations to model group polarization dynamics, while Zhang et al. [44] employed LLM-Based Agents to detect stances within polarized groups. These studies have yielded promising results, demonstrating the feasibility and value of applying large language models in this field."}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "As we mentioned in Section 1, to achieve an accurate measurement of group polarization, our proposed method consists of three parts, specifically:\n(i) A Community Sentiment Network (CSN) used to represent subgroups, the emotions between and within subgroups.\n(ii) A efficient multi-agent system for CSN construction.\n(iii) A group polarization metric based on the CSN, Community Opposition Index (COI).\nThe set of opinion texts will be used to identify subgroups and conduct sentiment analysis through the multi-agent system, forming a CSN. The current polarization measurement result for the time slice can then be calculated using the COI."}, {"title": "3.1 Community Sentiment Network", "content": "The Community Sentiment Network (CSN, see Fig. 1) is an extension of the \"Sentiment Thermometer\" method. The traditional \"Sentiment Thermometer\" could only be applied to two subgroups [18]. CSN extends the \"Sentiment Thermometer\" to a directed cyclic graph that involves emotions between multiple subgroups (see Figure 1). Let G = (V, E) be a graph, where V is the vertex set containing subgroups and E is the set of edges representing the sentimental relationships between subgroups. Each edge $e \\in E$ is defined as (u, v, s) where u, v $\\in$ V and s is the sentiment score. It should be noted that nodes v and u are allowed to be the same node, meaning self-loops are permitted. The score s can be either positive or negative, reflecting the positive or negative nature of the sentiment.\nUnlike traditional social networks, CSN uses sentiment rather than interactions as the basis for constructing connections. Also, CSN clearly illustrates the various subgroups with different stances within the target time period and reveals the emotional states between subgroups as well as the internal cohesion of each subgroup. Therefore, compared to clustering results or social networks, CSN significantly highlights the contributions of different subgroups to polarization, providing greater interpretability of the polarization state."}, {"title": "3.2 A Multi-Agent System For CSN Construction", "content": "The construction of the CSN involves multiple issues, such as subgroup identification, stance detection of opinion information, and sentiment recognition. However, existing research in the field of group polarization is insufficient to provide effective solutions to these issues. Therefore, inspired by the advancements in stance detection tasks [42], we designed a multi-agent system based on LLM-based agents (see Fig. 2).\nIn summary, our multi-agent system is composed of three stages: the Background Mining Stage, the Semantic Analysis Stage, and the Polarization Assessment Stage. The Background Mining Stage consists of Subgroup Exploration Expert and Domain Specialist, the Semantic Analysis Stage includes Social Media Veteran, Linguistic Expert, and Sentiment Analysis Expert. The Polarization Assessment Stage comprises Polarization Assessor. The agents collaborate through a series of interactions to provide accurate subgroup division results and reliable sentiment scores (see Alg. 1). We will provide a detailed explanation of each stage and the functions of the respective agents in the following paragraphs.\nBackground Mining Stage For the construction of the CSN, the first issue we need to address is how the multi-agent system understands the overall event within the context of the event. To solve this, we propose the Background Min-"}, {"title": "3.3 Community Opposition Index (COI)", "content": "We have designed a dedicated group polarization metric for CSN to derive a comparable and interpretable polarization index from its complex graph structure. In previous research on sentiment-based polarization measurement, a widely accepted viewpoint is that the stronger the internal cohesion within subgroups and the greater the hostility between subgroups, the higher the level of polarization [18,19,26,41,43]. The \"Sentiment Thermometer\" was developed based on this perspective, and its approach of calculating sentiment temperature differences has gained widespread recognition and practical use [7,17,18,26,41]. However, as we mentioned earlier, this method is only applicable when there are exactly two subgroups involved in group polarization. Therefore, we extended this calculation method to the multi-group domain and proposed the Community Opposition Index (COI).\nFirstly, we calculate the sentiment score of a subgroup towards the other subgroups:\n$(-l_{ij})_{l_{ij} \\leq 0}$\nHere, $e_{ij}$ represents the sentiment score of subgroup i towards subgroup j. $l_{e_{ij}\\leq 0}$ means that we consider friendly subgroups as not contributing to the overall group polarization.\nSubsequently, we sum the sentiment scores of subgroup i towards all other related subgroups and take into account the internal cohesion within each subgroup. Therefore, we get the polarization score of subgroup i. Here, $t_i$ represents the internal cohesion of the subgroup i.\n$t_i \\sum_j (-l_{ij})_{l_{ij} \\leq 0}$\nFinally, we weight the overall sentiment score of each subgroup according to its size and calculate the final polarization score."}, {"title": "4 Zero-Shot Experiments", "content": "Our experiments will be conducted on the multi-agent system.

This dataset includes large number of varying targets, and it includes three types of stances: Pro, Con and Neutral.\nThe statistics of our utilized datasets are shown in Table 2. Since our model's use case is almost zero-shot, we will utilize these three datasets to conduct zero-shot stance detection. We will strictly adhere to the licensing requirements of the respective datasets.\nTo better evaluate the model's performance, we selected appropriate metrics based on existing literature [2,25,29]. For the SEM16 and P-Stance datasets, we chose $F_{avg}$, which represents the average of F1 scores for Favor and Against. For the VAST dataset, we opted for Macro-F1 as the evaluation metric."}, {"title": "4.2 Model Adjustment", "content": "Since the primary purpose of our designed multi-agent system is to construct the CSN, we need to adjust the model for the experiments.

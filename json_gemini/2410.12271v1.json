Consider the relationship that the sentences in (2a) and (3a) stand in to their corresponding yes-no questions. The question form of (2a) consists of the same words rearranged, as in (2b); we can describe the rearrangement by saying that the word 'will' has been displaced to the front of the sentence. One could imagine that this was an instance of a count-based rule that formed questions by displacing the third word of a sentence, but we can see that this is not the case because applying this count-based rule to (3a) yields (3b). The actual rule under investigation somehow yields (3c), where it is the sixth word that is displaced.\n(2) a. The dog will bark\nb. Will the dog bark?\n(3) a. The dog in the corner will bark\nb. * In the dog the corner will bark?\nC. Will the dog in the corner bark?\nConsidering now (4a), the question-forming rule displaces neither the third word nor the sixth word (which would yield (4b) and (4c) respectively). What (2b) and (3c) have in common is that in both cases the displaced word is 'will', and this also holds of the desired form (4d) where the displaced 'will' was the eighth word. But the rule under investigation somehow excludes moving the other 'will', the fourth word of (4a), to produce (4e).\n(4) a.

Will the dog that will chase the cat bark?\ne. * Will the dog that chase the cat will bark?\nAnd it is not as simple as always moving the last/rightmost occurrence of 'will' (or more generally, an auxiliary verb), as illustrated by the pattern in (5).\n(5) a. The dog in the corner will chase the dog that will bark\nb. Will the dog in the corner chase the dog that will bark?\nC. * Will the dog in the corner will chase the dog that bark?"}, {"title": "", "content": "The operative rule cannot be formulated in count-based terms, i.e. no description of the form \"the nth word of the sentence\" or \"the nth occurrence of 'will' from the end of the sentence\" will consistently pick out the word that is to be displaced.\nThe correct generalization can be expressed in terms of hierarchical constituency: given the structural analyses in (6) for the declaratives in (4) and (5), the displaced word is the Aux that is the granddaughter of the root S node in the template in (7).\n(6)\nThis example from English is entirely representative: patterns like this that conform to a constituency-based rule, but where no count-based characterization has been found, are ubiquitous in natural languages. And the reverse situation, where a pattern follows a count-based rule but has no constituency-based characteri-zation, is unheard of. The conventional linguistic explanation for this striking asymmetry is that (languages with) count-based rules are \u201chumanly impossible\u201d outside the capacity of the mental faculties that are re-cruited in naturalistic language development. Of course, given a simple enough artificial grammar-learning experiment, a human may well show some success at learning and applying a count-based rule, perhaps by recruiting other mental faculties to the task; somewhat similarly, a proponent of the idea that LLMs embody a human-like ill-suitedness to count-based rules is not committed to the prediction that an LLM will always show precisely zero evidence of having extracted any count-based rule from training data. Rather than any raw measure of successful learning of any single kind of rule, the critical issue is an asymmetry between count-based and constituency-based rules.\nTesting for such an asymmetry obviously requires controlling for other factors. While the rule for the placement of the  and P markers in Kallini et al.'s WORDHOP is a canonical example of a count-based rule the kind that turns out to be insufficient to describe the pattern in (2)-(5) the rule for placing these markers in NOHOP is not an appropriately representative constituency-based rule to compare it against. The NOHOP rule is extremely simple: the marker should be placed immediately after the verb. It's true that the full-fledged English system of verbal inflections involves crucially constituency-based rules, which are in fact closely intertwined with the classic phenomena in (2)-(5) above, and one of the configurations that this system produces is the one illustrated in (1), with the inflected verb 'cleans'. But the constituency-based parts of that system are not probed by a comparison between WORDHOP and NOHOP, which differ only in whether the  and P markers are separated from the verb by four words or zero words."}, {"title": "2 Constituency and English verbal inflections", "content": "A mistaken impression that NOHOP can serve as a representative of constituency-based rules might arise, in part, from the fact that the behaviour of verbal inflections is intertwined with the question-forming rule that is used in the classical illustration of constituency-sensitivity rehearsed in section 1.\nThis connection can be established by observing that these inflections (e.g. the suffixes in 'cleans' and 'cleaned') do not co-occur with words like 'will' that are displaced by the question-forming rule. A finite clause must include either one of these inflections or a word that behaves like 'will' (e.g. \u2018may', 'must', \u2018can'), but not both.\n(8) a. * He clean\nb. He will clean\nc. He may clean\n(9) a. He cleans\nb. * He will cleans\nc. * He may cleans\n(10) a. He cleaned\nb. * He will cleaned\nc. * He may cleaned\nSo we have effectively identified a three-way dependency between (i) the sentence-initial position occupied by 'will' in the questions in section 1, (ii) the position occupied by 'will' in non-questions, in section 1 and in (8)-(10), and (iii) the position occupied by the inflectional affixes in (8)-(10). This can be formalized in various ways (see Chomsky (1957) for the original analysis along these lines), but the dotted lines in (11) convey the key idea in a way that will suffice for our purposes here.\n(12) a. Does he clean? (cf. (9a))\nb. Did he clean? (cf. (10a))\nc. Will he clean? (cf. (8b))\nd. May he clean? (cf. (8c))\nNo matter how these details are formalized, the crucial and uncontroversial point is that these three inter-dependent positions are identified in constituent-based terms, not count-based terms. We saw in section 1 that the relationship between positions (i) and (ii) is not defined via a number of intervening words, but rather with reference to the hierarchical structure. Similarly, although the word that an affix in position (iii) attaches to has been adjacent to position (ii) in all the examples so far, this is not true in general: additional"}, {"title": "", "content": "words can intervene here too, as illustrated by (13). The presence of a direct object after the verb in these sentences also demonstrates that position (iii) can not be defined linearly as \"the end of the string\".\n(13) a. He will without doubt clean his very messy bookshelf.\nb. He without doubt cleans his very messy bookshelf.\nFurthermore, although the discussion in section 1 emphasized only the hierarchical determination of the auxiliary that should be displaced to the front of the sentence, this target position is in fact defined in hierarchical terms too: (14) shows examples of questions where 'will' is in position (i) despite not being sentence-initial.\n(14) a. Which very messy bookshelf will he clean?\nb. How will he clean his very messy bookshelf?\nc. Though his bookshelf is very messy, will he clean it?\nAnother way in which English verbal inflections are intertwined with crucially hierarchical notions concerns number agreement with the subject; recall the two columns in (1). There is a single hierarchically-defined position that the agreement-controlling noun 'gift(s)' occupies in all of the examples in (15)-(16). The rule needs to pick out the second word (and the first of the two nouns) in (15), but the third word (and the second of the two nouns) in (16), so again no count-based formulation is possible.\n(15) a. The gift from the alumnus { matters\nb. The gift from the alumni {matter\nc. The gifts from the alumnus {matter\nd. The gifts from the alumni {matter\n(16) a. The alumnus's gift {matters\nb. The alumni's gift {matters\nc. The alumnus's gifts {matter\nd. The alumni's gifts {matter\nBoth of these phenomena have (with good reason) been prominent test cases in work investigating connec-tionist systems' treatment of constituency-based generalizations. Studies using the question-forming rule as a probe into this issue include Frank and Mathis (2007), McCoy et al. (2020) and Warstadt and Bowman (2020), and those using subject-verb agreement include Linzen et al. (2016), Kuncoro et al. (2018) and Lakretz et al. (2021). And as illustrated in this section, the crucially constituency-sensitive rules under-lying both of these phenomena bear on the distribution of English inflected verb forms (e.g. 'cleans' and 'cleaned') that Kallini et al. manipulate in order to create WORDHOP and NOHOP. But English sentences with those inflected verb forms are a shared \"starting point\" for these two artificial languages, which differ only in whether the  and P markers occur in the hierarchically-defined position (iii) or at a count-based offset from that position. The constituency-based patterns in which verbal inflections participate the de-pendency between the three positions illustrated in (11), and the hierarchical determination of the controller of agreement illustrated in (15)-(16) are irrelevant for any comparison between WORDHOP and NOHOP. WORDHOP contains just as much constituency-based question-formation, and just as much hierarchically-sensitive agreement, as NOHOP does. A comparison between the two just amounts to a comparison between the count-based displacement in WORDHOP, and the absence of any analogous displacement in NOHOP."}, {"title": "3 Towards a better comparison: counting vs. constituency", "content": "The problem with the comparison between WORDHOP and NOHOP is that the count-based rule in WORD-HOP is not the counterpart of any constituency-based rule in NOHOP. There are two ways we might seek to rectify this. The first is to keep WORDHOP as our representative count-based language, and introduce a constituency-based rule to be the necessary counterpart: compare WORDHOP, where the  and P markers are placed at a count-based offset from position (iii), against a new synthetic language where these markers are placed at a constituency-based offset from position (iii). The second possibility is to keep NOHOP as our representative constituency-based language, and replace one of the constituency-based rules governing the placement of the  and P markers with a count-based rule. Either route leads to some subtle issues that remain to be worked out, and my aim here is only to advance the discussion in a way that lays out the logic and clarifies what is needed, not to fully resolve the isssues that arise.\nTo introduce a constituency-based counterpart to WORDHOP's count-based rule, we need to identify a hierarchically-defined offset from position (iii) where markers would be placed in the new artificial language. Suppose we choose the right edge of the sister constituent of position (iii)'s parent V node; this will be the right edge of the direct object, in many cases. (There is no such constituent in the minimal diagrams in (11), but notice the relevant NP constituents in (6).) Then we would have a comparison between the count-based language illustrated in (17) (unchanged from Kallini et al.'s WORDHOP) and the constituency-based language illustrated in (18).\n(17) Count-based (unchanged from WORDHOP)\na. He clean his very messy bookshelf s\nb. He clean the bookshelf with glee s\nc. He clean it with a big s red broom\nd. He clean the bookshelf that is s messy\n(18) Constituency-based\na. He clean his very messy bookshelf s\nb. He clean the bookshelf s with glee\nc. He clean its with a big red broom\nd. He clean the bookshelf that is messy s\nOne challenge here is that synthesizing examples like those in (18) from their English equivalents requires settling on an analysis of what counts as a sister of the relevant V node, which will be controversial in some cases; and in practical terms, even to the extent that analyses of individual cases are uncontroversial, they would likely to difficult to automate.\nA more subtle concern is whether the pattern in (18) is necessarily describable only in terms of a constituency-based offset from position (iii), or whether it has an alternative characterization in terms of a constituency-based offset from position (ii). If the position of the markers in (18) can be understood as part of a hierarchically-defined dependency with position (ii), then the pattern in (18) would be no better than No-HOP: the comparison between (17) and (18) would again be a comparison between the composition of a constituency-based and a count-based offset from position (ii), and an only constituency-based offset from position (ii). The underlying question here is whether the composition of two constituency-based relations is always another valid constituency-based relation. The answer will depend on the details of one's theory of linguistically possible dependencies, which remains an active research topic. (It may bear repeating here that the exclusion of count-based dependencies is not one of the points of disagreement.)\nConsider now the other route, where we pit a count-based rule against one of the existing constituency-based rules underlying NOHOP. Let's suppose the relevant count-based rule placed the s and P markers at a four-word offset from position (ii), as a counterpart to the standard hierarchically-defined relationship between position (ii) and position (iii) illustrated in (11). This comparison is illustrated in (19) and (20).\n(19) Count-based\na. He clean his messy bookshelf s\nb. He always clean his messy s bookshelf\nc. He without doubt clean it s\nd.

He clean sit with a broom"}, {"title": "", "content": "The necessary syntactic analysis for synthesizing examples like (19) only requires identifying position (ii) (the position of auxiliary verbs in standard declaratives), which is likely less controversial than the issues that arise for (18) surrounding sister constituents of the verb.\nA questionable aspect of the comparison between (19) and (20) is that, in the constituency-based pattern, the word immediately preceding the marker is always of the same category (namely a verb), whereas in the count-based pattern the words preceding the marker are heterogeneous in syntactic category. (This is also a characteristic of the comparison between WORDHOP and NoHOP.) This could be thought to make the constituency-based pattern more \"predictable\" or \"simple\" than the count-based one in a sense that we would like to control for. Notice that this consistency of an adjacent category is not a general property of constituency-based rules: in (18) we see the marker follow 'bookshelf', 'it' and 'messy', which belong to distinct syntactic categories. Rather it is a consequence of the fact that the rule that relates position (ii) and position (iii) in English (\"affix hopping\u201d) is somewhat anomalous in ways that lead to divided opinions over whether it is best considered a morphological or syntactic rule (e.g. Halle and Marantz, 1993, pp.134-138; Embick and Noyer, 2001, pp.584-591).\nAs mentioned above, I make no attempt to resolve all these issues here; the main goal of presenting (17) vs. (18) and (19) vs. (20) is to lay out the logic of what would make an informative comparison between count-based and constituency-based rules, and in doing so clarify the earlier critiques of the comparison that Kallini et al. report."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "In natural languages, words that are linked by some grammatical dependency do not always appear adjacent to each other. What linguists have taken to be striking is that the rules governing these non-adjacent configurations of co-dependent words are never describable in terms of (relative) numerical positions in the string; instead, the positions involved are characterized in constituency-based terms. This is hypothesized to be a consequence of an important difference in the status of count-based versus constituency-based rules in the human mind. Kallini et al. present their comparison between WORDHOP and NOHOP as a test of whether GPT-2 shows an analogous asymmetry, but these two artificial languages do not differ in the appropriate way for this interpretation: the count-based rule in WORDHOP has no counterpart (constituency-based or otherwise) in NOHOP, and so differences in learning success reflect the presence of this additional rule, not an asymmetry between two kinds of rules.\nOf course, nothing I have said amounts to any claim about the underlying question of whether an LLM might exhibit a human-like asymmetry between count-based and constituency-based rules. The claim here is just that the experiments reported by Kallini et al. leave the issue untouched."}]}

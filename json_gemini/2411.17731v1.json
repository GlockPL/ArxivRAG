To increase crop productivity, soil require some specific characteristics. For watermelon cultivation, soil needs to be sandy and of high temperature with proper irrigation. This research aims to design and implement an intelligent IoT-based soil characterization system for the watermelon field to measure the soil characteristics. IoT based developed system measures moisture, temperature, and pH of soil using different sensors, and the sensor data is uploaded to the cloud via Arduino and Raspberry Pi, from where users can obtain the data using mobile application and webpage developed for this system. To ensure the precision of the framework, this study includes the comparison between the readings of the soil parameters by the existing field soil meters, the values obtained from the sensors integrated IoT system, and data obtained from soil science laboratory. Excessive salinity in soil affects the watermelon yield. This paper proposes a model for the measurement of soil salinity based on soil resistivity. It establishes a relationship between soil salinity and soil resistivity from the data obtained in the laboratory using artificial neural network (ANN).", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "About 26% of the earth's surface is land. Human lives on the terrestrial, solid Earth, comprised of bedrock and the endured bedrock called soil. Soil is a mixture of inorganic mineral particles and organic matter of contrasting size and course of action. The particles constitute roughly 50% of the soil's volume. The pores inside the soil contain water, air, and these pores are the rest of the volume [1]. Several recent studies [2]-[13] have suggested that utilizing IoT devices for real-time soil data collection and monitoring emerges as a widespread method to enhance crop productivity effectively. Bachuwar et al. have collected the data of soil moisture, light intensity, temperature, humidity from agricultural fields and monitored the data in ThingSpeak web and android applications [14]. Along with pH, temperature, and soil moisture, R. Madhumathi et al. measured N, P, K of soil as well for ensuring better yields [15]. In another study, soil information is sent to smartphones via Wi-Fi where crop suggestions are made by analyzing the values of sensors, and the crop images are monitored to see if pesticides are needed [16]. After collecting soil information via sensors, the data is sent as an SMS to the client's mobile phone via a GSM network, which is helpful in remote areas where the mobile network is poor [17]. A. Na, W. Isaac, S. Varshney et al. have used Bluetooth technology to transfer data to a nearby cellphone which is developed on the STM32 Nucleo platform [18]. The introduction of artificial intelligence specially artificial neural network has taken the field of agriculture to another level [19]-[27]. In the works of R. Singh, S. Srivastava et al., soil information like humidity, temperature, moisture, and other data responsible for plant growth is obtained and the variation of plant growth rate with respect to the intensity of light is monitored. Data is analyzed to find the suitable condition after training Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, and Gradient Boosting classifiers that achieved the accuracy of 83.33% [28]. Some case studies were used as examples to compare results, and a machine learning model was developed to make a decision on crops that would provide maximum output in a particular area. In this way, farmers can achieve higher yields and earn more profits [29]. An automated irrigation system consisting of a wireless temperature sensor and a soil moisture sensor programmed to the microcontroller has been developed to optimize water usage. ANN is used for optimizing the usage of water in this system as it predicts the water usage in the coming days. There has been more research on IoT based artificial intelligence approaches. A. Aliberti et al. present an innovative system based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology for forecasting the indoor air temperature of the building [30]. In detail, the methodology uses a specialized non-linear autoregressive neural network. This system makes short-and medium-term predictions, envisioning two different exploitations: (i) on realistic artificial data and (ii) on real data collected by IoT devices deployed in the building. Prediction models are trained on realistic synthetic data based on a NAR architecture with a high number of regressors. The accuracy of both real and synthetic data is investigated. This methodology has been trying to compensate the lack of real-world data in this sector. Al has been used to explore co-relationships between different soil parameters. Soil parameters like pH has been measured to determine the availability of the micronutrients in soil that suggests soil with required nutrients. This system helps to improve the yield of quality crops. There has been much research regarding the correlation between soil properties and resistivity[30]-[35]. Determining the electrical resistivity of soil will help us learn more about soil characteristics. The impact of soil properties, such as soil pH, soil salinity, and soil electrical conductivity, on the growth of cucumbers has been evaluated using the 2D Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) method. A correlation between inverted electrical resistivity response, soil properties, and crop yield has been derived using regression analysis. There are many more approaches to determine soil salinity [36]-[41]. It has been observed that low resistivity could help to increase the salinity and moisture content of the soil [42]. The geophysical application of this study can enhance agricultural practices and increase crop yields. The relationship between soil electrical resistivity ratio and soil properties is crucial for obtaining reliable soil information. The soil moisture content is measured at shallow soil water content in farmland using the Continuous Vertical Electrical Sounding technique. Different types of lands were selected, and there was a heterogeneous distribution of moisture in these lands [43]. A correlation between electrical resistivity and dry density in compacted soil, which will help to measure soil compaction on site. The conventional method of estimating soil compaction is costly and tedious. The mathematical model for soil compaction measurement helps get maximum dry density and optimum moisture contents, showing fast and cost-effective performance in compacted soil monitoring. Determining the relationship between chemical properties of soil and electrical resistivity helps to learn more about soil characteristics which may improve yields [44]. The chemical properties of soil such as soil salinity, cation exchange capacity, soil pH is determined by the electrical resistivity of soil. Different tests have been performed to determine the effect of chemical characteristics through electrical resistivity, such as Self-potential (SP), four-electrode probe method, vertical electrical sounding, electrical profiling, and non-contact electromagnetic profiling [45].\nHaving suitable sandy soil in almost all of riverside places, Bangladesh produces a significant number of watermelons. Since the ancient days of agriculture, farmers used to see the land and decide to cultivate a crop based on their expertise and assumption that the crop could be suitable for that soil. Farmers encounter different challenges when cultivating watermelon. They become helpless when it rains unexpectedly, and even after stopping the rain, they can't sow seeds until the soil gets dried to under a certain moisture level. Sometimes they can't sow the seeds for a whole season. Also, different soil fields have distinct characteristics and need to be treated accordingly. They still have no idea about soil parameters and what values of these parameters are optimal for watermelon growth. So, the consistency in the fruit quality is hampered. The farmers use fertilizer by assumption without knowing which one is best and how much is needed. They use pesticides for disease and insect attacks and fertilizer for any other problems.\nTypically, land in a certain area possesses almost similar characteristics owing to geographical factors. So, if the soil characteristics of a specific region can be measured, then farmers can decide whether the area is suitable for watermelon cultivation. pH value, temperature, moisture, and other soil factors are needed to be measured before sowing the seeds to increase the production rate on a large scale. The agriculturists determine the soil characteristics of a specific area by testing the soil in the lab and then decide whether the specific area is suitable for a specific crop or not for cultivation. But these laboratory-based procedures are time consuming and costly. For measuring the soil parameters, intelligent soil characterization systems can be employed that are comprised of different wireless sensors. The system will track the data with the sensors and then send the data to the cloud, from where the farmers can obtain the most up-to-date soil characteristics via mobile application and webpage.\nThis research finds how suitable the land is for watermelon cultivation and what to do to make the land more preferable for cultivating watermelon using IoT based soil characterization system. This study also finds a relationship between soil salinity and soil resistivity as the sensors primarily use the electrical properties of soil to characterize the soil parameters. The change in soil salinity affects electrical characteristics like soil resistivity."}, {"title": "II. SITE VISIT AND SAMPLECOLLECTION", "content": "A field visit is a form of experiential learning activity where learners are in direct contact with the field being studied. In this approach, generalization can be prepared by observation and real-life experiences. Farm field visit offer a hands-on insight into how local agriculture work. During the field visit, the research team have visited some watermelon fields at Noluabagi under Galachipa Upazila in the Patuakhali district. Almost 50 farmers harvest watermelon frequently in that village. The experiences of the field visit were beneficial and informative as the team interacted with the farmers to acquire precise facts on watermelon cultivation.\nA farmer cultivates around 4/5 bighas of land on average. In Bangladesh, one bigha equals to approximately 1337.8 square meters where 2500-2700 pieces of watermelons are produced in one Bigha. The research team have visited the site when the fields were ready to sow the seeds, and very tiny watermelon plants were spotted in certain fields. The team have observed the germinated seeds stored for seeding and visited the field along with the farmers, and obtained the reading of different soil characteristics using different soil meters. The research team have collaborated with the local agricultural agent to know more about watermelon cultivation and to verify the information provided by the local farmers. The team collects the watermelon cultivation information through a survey questionnaire.\nFrom the outcome of a successful interview with farmers about watermelon cultivation, the research team understood about site selection for preferable production, i.e., choose ideal conditional soil, land preparation, seed planting, watermelon plant insects & diseases, watermelon harvesting, etc. Mr. Hashem Ali, age 44, claims he has been cultivating watermelons for almost 20 years. He states that most farmers in this area grow \"Patenga Giant\" watermelon. There are several additional types as well that the farmers prefer.\nSweet Baby, Top Yield, Bigtop, Champion, Ampere, World Queen, Glory, Ocean Hybrid, and Victor Super Hybrid, etc., are the most prevalent watermelon types in Bangladesh. Mr. Asir Sheikh said recently, \"Black Jumbo\" has been profitable for farming, and they are considering switching to this variety of watermelon to cultivate. According to him, watermelon grows especially in warm temperatures. The sandy loam type of slightly acidic soil is ideal for watermelon cultivation. Clay soil is also suitable for cultivation of watermelon. He argues that soil preparation is a crucial aspect for cultivation of watermelon. Amending the soil may increase the production of watermelon. Seaweed, aged manure, and well-rotted compost can be utilized for soil amendments.\nMr. Harun Sikdar, another watermelon farmer in the village, states that he does not know how to use the technological advantage to prepare the soil. Instead, he adopts old conventional procedures to prepare the field for watermelon cultivation. He, along with his fellow farmers, does not employ any modern technology to test the suitability of the soil for cultivation. They use their experience, and occasionally they decide on assumption. Sometimes the production is good, and sometimes it is not."}, {"title": "III.

Soil characteristics identification devices like AD1000-AD1200 professional pH-ORP-TEMP Bench meter and KERRO 0-80% Digital Soil Moisture Meter have been used in the laboratory to take the temperature, moisture, and pH of the collected soil.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the soil samples collected from the field are measured by a KERRO 0-80% Digital Soil Moisture Meter to measure moisture in the laboratory. Then it is cleaned up of waste and unwanted material, and after that the soil is dried, and converted into powder. Then the soil is mixed with water. 10g of soil is taken for each sample and 20 ml of water is combined to measure the pH value. The sample mixed with water is shaken for about 45 minutes. Then the values of pH and temperature were measured and documented."}, {"title": "B.

Then the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno are connected by serial communication through the Arduino USB cable, as shown in the Fig. 4. Fig. 5 depicts the experimental work of the system to take the data of different soil parameters from the soil collected from the watermelon field.\nThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) platform and API to store and monitor real time data online utilizing the HTTP protocol over the Internet.

Once data is on a ThingSpeak channel, it could be analyzed and visualized using the MATLAB tool. The mobile application and web page, which are connected to the ThingSpeak server, then display the data. The mobile application developed for this system receives the digital data from the ThingSpeak cloud server and stores it in a local database. To acquire additional insights and depth regarding the collected data, the research team have communicated with the agriculturists and collected a reference value of pH, moisture, and temperature for a particular type of soil to determine if the sample of soil is suitable to utilize for watermelon cultivation. This data is recorded in the database of the mobile application. After collecting readings from the sensors, the mobile application analyzes the data and compares it with the standard values given by agriculturists.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOIL RESISTIVITY AND SALINITY", "content": "Electrical resistivity is a natural property that indicates how emphatically a given material opposes the stream of electric current. Soil electrical resistivity is viewed as a representative of the spatial and fleeting vacillation of several other soil physical parameters like structure, water content, or fluid composition. It is influenced by the physical characteristics, chemical properties, moisture content, the number of electrolytes, and ultimately, temperature. Many resistors and conductors have a uniform cross-area with a uniform progression of electric flow and are constructed of one material.\nIn this case, the electrical resistivity p (Greek: rho) is defined as:\n$\\rho = \\frac{RA}{L}$ (1)\nWhere, R is the electrical resistance of a uniform material (estimated in ohms, \u03a9), L is the length of the piece of material (measured in meter, m), and A is the cross-sectional area of the specimen (measured in a square meter).\nSoil electric resistivity is acquired by passing the electric currents using an electric source. Electric current is conducted in the soil between the two steel probes. The amount of current that flows through the soil between the probes is straightforwardly proportionate to the electrical conductivity of the soil. The current is distinguished at the opposite end of the electrode, and reasonable voltage differences are considered to obtain resistance from soil. On the other hand, salinity is the measurement of the amount of mineral salt in the soil. Here, the salinity is measured in the unit of Percentage (%) means the quantity of salt in a particular solution or soil sample. A small bowl of known length (L) and cross-sectional area (A) and SANWA YX-360-TRF Multi Tester has been used to find the soil resistivity of the collected soil sample.\nThe generation of an electrical field in the soil provides information about the electrical conductivity and resistivity of soil. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the electrical field is generated during the passing of electrical signals from one probe to another probe through the compacted soil. The length L is measured here on a meter scale. This is the distance between the two probes of the analog multimeter. The cross-sectional area (A) of the small bowl is measured by A= \u03c0r\u00b2 as the bowl is a round shape. The resistance (R) is obtained by the reading of the multimeter. Using these values, the resistivity is measured for several samples of the soil of different salinity. The length between the two probes, L = 0.05 m\nRadius of circular bowl = .05m.\nThe cross-sectional area of the bowl, $A = \\pi r^2 = 3.1416 \\times (.05)^2 = 0.00784 m^2$\nFor 20% salinity with a fixed 5% moisture, we get the resistance (R) of these soil samples from the analog multimeter is 150 \u039a\u03a9. Then we find the resistivity(p) from Equation (1),\n$p = \\frac{RA}{L} = \\frac{150 \\times.00784 \\times1000}{.05 \\times1000} = 23.52 K\\Omega M$."}, {"title": "2. SALINITY-RESISTIVITY RELATIONSHIP APPROXIMATION USING ANN'S", "content": "Finding a correlation between data has led to several discoveries in the history of science. But for accurate correlation, data has to be reliable and there needs to be a precise methodology. With increasing data, correlation can be identified between different characteristics that would not ordinarily be sought. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) stands as a cutting-edge method for correlating various properties, renowned for its proficiency in mapping non-linear relationships between system inputs and outputs, while adeptly managing vast datasets [14]. Mimicking the human brain's intricate structure and functionality, ANNs excel in recognizing complex patterns and solving predictive problems. These computational models convert a set of numerical inputs into specific outputs, incorporating different configurations like single-layer or multi-layer networks and choosing between feed-forward and recurrent setups. In this research, the pH, temperature and resistivity are obtained from the soil sample and the salinity of the soil is estimated. With ANN, a correlation has been established between the gathered data from soil like pH, moisture, temperature, resistivity and salinity. In this study, the data has been acquired by using different sensors and the analog sensor readings have been transformed into digital values through a microcontroller.\nThe datasets focus on moisture levels of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, excluding 40% and 50% due to early saturation and insufficient non-linear salinity data in resistivity measurements. The dataset has four inputs and one output:\nMoisture: Soil moisture refers to the amount of water contained within the soil, crucial for plant growth, climate regulation, and ecosystem health.\npH: Soil pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity in soils, affecting nutrient availability, microbial activity, and plant growth.\nTemperature: Soil temperature is the warmth of the soil, which influences plant growth, microbial activity, and overall ecosystem health, varying by depth, time of day, and season. It is measured in degrees Celsius.\nResistivity: Soil resistivity is a measure of the soil's ability to resist the flow of electric current, affected by moisture content, temperature, and the types of minerals present. The resistance of a soil sample is measured by a multimeter. Resistivity is obtained from multimeter readings.\nSalinity: Soil salinity refers to the concentration of soluble salts in the soil, which can affect plant growth, soil structure, and microbial activity, influenced by irrigation practices, climate, and soil type.\nThe output of the datasets is soil salinity. It is evaluated in percentage with respect to the sample of the soil. The dataset consists of 100 samples. The dataset is split into three parts.\n1.Training set: 70% of the dataset, 70 samples\n2.Validation set: 15% of the dataset, 15 samples.\n3.Test set: 15% of the dataset, 15 samples.\nIn the described scenario, the ANN's design features three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, employing a feed-forward neural network model. This model is selected for its effectiveness in accurately mapping any finite set of input-output relations. The training set of the dataset is used to train the ANN model which is used for computing the gradient and updating the weights and biases by minimizing the cost function. In training, a neural network learns to recognize the underlying association between inputs and output. The second subset is a validation set (15%). During the training process, validation error is monitored. The network weights and biases are saved at the minimum validation set error. The validation set is also employed in early halting if further training decreases the model performance. And finally, after training and validation, the test set (15%) is used to measure how well the network generalizes the data. There are different types of neural networks but, in this task, feed-forward neural network is used. In the current study, the network undergoes training using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm [46].

RELATION BETWEEN ELECTRICAL RESISTIVITY AND SOIL SALINITY", "content": "Based on the data obtained in Table I, a relation between soil electrical resistivity and soil salinity can be established. By plotting the data and through the resistivity vs. soil salinity graph, an equation has been established.\nFor 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% moisture levels, the plots are drawn respectively as follows:\nThe increase in salinity corresponds to decrease in resistivity and vice versa.\nThe equation derived for 5% moisture level is:\n$Y = 26.213e^{-0.007X}$ (2)\nWhere R2 = 0.9802\nThe equation derived for 10% moisture level is:\n$Y = 1.7002e^{-0.007X}$ (3)\nWhere R2 = 0.8825\nThe equation derived for 20% moisture level is:\n$Y = 0.1873e^{-0.009X}$ (4)\nWhere R2 = 0.9913\nThe equation derived for 30% moisture level is:\n$Y = 0.0477e^{-0.009X}$ (5)\nWhere R2 = 0.607\nThe equation derived for 40% moisture level is:\n$Y = 0.0258e^{-0.003X}$ (6)\nWhere R2 = 0.4419\nThe equation derived for 50% moisture level is:\n$Y = 0.0332e^{-0.008X}$ (7)\nWhere R2 = 0.4767\nIn the equations, Y represents the electrical resistivity of the soil, and X is the soil salinity. R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line, or how well the regression predictions match the actual data points. The value of R\u00b2 is closer to 1 demonstrates that the nearer the regression predictions fit the data.\nTo find out the equation of soil salinity from soil resistivity, equation (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) can be applied with a specific moisture level respective to 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%.\nFor 5% moisture level from eqn. 2,\n$Y = 26.213e^{-0.007X}$\nR2 = 0.9802\nLet, A & B an arbitrary constant.\nA = 26.213\nB = 0.007\nGiven that,\n$Y = Ae^{-BX}$\nor, ln Y = ln ($Ae^{-BX}$)\nor, ln Y = ln A + In $e^{-Bx}$\nor, In Y - ln A = -BX\nIn e = 1\n, $BX = ln A - In Y$ or\n$BX = ln \\frac{A}{Y}$ or,\n$X=  \\frac{1}{-B}In \\frac{1}{A^-Y} =  \\frac{1}{0.007} In \\frac{26.213}{Y}$ Subsequently, for 10% moisture level from eqn. 3,\n$:: X = \\frac{1}{0.006} In  \\frac{1.6843}{Y}$ (9)\nFor 20% moisture level from eqn. 4,\n$:: X = \\frac{1}{0.009} In  \\frac{0.1873}{Y}$ (10)\nFor 30% moisture level from eqn. 5,\n$:: X = \\frac{1}{0.009} In  \\frac{0.0477}{Y}$ (11)\nFor 40% moisture level from eqn. 6,\n$:: X = \\frac{1}{0.003} In  \\frac{0.0258}{Y}$ (12)\nFor 50% moisture level from eqn. 7,\n$:: X = \\frac{1}{0.008} In  \\frac{0.0332}{Y}$ (13)\nThese findings investigate the relationship between soil resistivity and soil salinity across different moisture levels, revealing a significant variation in this relationship as moisture content increases. It's well-documented that soil resistivity decreases with an increase in moisture, which naturally impacts the mathematical models representing these relationships. As a result, the equations defining the relationship between soil resistivity and salinity vary across different moisture levels, reflecting the influence of moisture on the soil's electrical properties.\nMany soil sensors operate based on soil electrical properties; establishing a strong relationship between resistivity (an electrical property) and soil salinity is critical. Our research has successfully formulated equations for each moisture level, ranging from 5% to 50%, each showcasing a unique exponential relationship between soil resistivity and salinity.

ANN correlation output", "content": "In the MATLAB environment, nntraintool is used to train the ANN on dataset. The comprehensive analysis of soil salinity using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is demonstrated through regression plots (Fig. 16), learning performance over epochs (Fig. 17), and error histograms (Fig. 18), each offering critical insights into the model's predictive capabilities.\nRegression plots reveal the ANN's exceptional fit to the training data across varying moisture levels, as indicated by high R\u00b2 values. At 5% moisture (Fig. 16(a)), the model yields an R2 of 0.99627 for training, 0.99088 for validation, 0.99632 for testing, and an overall of 0.99519, highlighting its precision in estimating soil salinity with the given inputs. The trend of high accuracy persists at 10% moisture (Fig. 16(b)) with R\u00b2 values of 0.99634 for training, 0.9952 for validation, and 0.993 overall, although a slight dip in the test R2 to 0.96091 suggests potential room for optimization.

At 30% moisture (Fig. 16(d)), a marginal fluctuation in R2 values is observed, with 0.95646 for training, 0.94273 for validation, and a rebound to 0.99405 in testing, with an overall value of 0.95914. These values collectively underscore the ANN's robustness and underline the input variables' significance in the salinity prediction process.\nThe learning performance, captured through the mean squared error (MSE) against epochs, displays the ANN's learning efficiency and adjustment to the data across moisture levels. For a 5% moisture level (Fig. 17(a)), the best validation performance was at an MSE of 0.239 at epoch 21, signifying a competent learning rate. An impressively low best validation MSE of 0.00063506 at epoch 5 for the 10% moisture level (Fig. 17(b)) indicates an exceptionally good fit of the model from an early stage. The 20% moisture level (Fig. 17(c)) showed the best validation performance with an MSE of 8.1263e-07 at epoch 3, reflecting quick learning and pattern recognition by the ANN. At the 30% moisture level (Fig. 17(d)), the model quickly adapts again, with the best validation MSE recorded at 8.3659e-05 at epoch 4. The differences in the number of epochs to achieve best validation performance at each moisture level highlight the ANN's adaptability and point to varying complexities within the data.\nThe error histograms provide a visual representation of the predictive accuracy at different moisture levels, showing a concentration of predictions around the zero-error mark. For the 5% moisture level (Fig. 18(a)), about 35 instances hit the zero-error bin, with errors predominantly between -0.1 and +0.1. The 10% moisture level (Fig. 18(b)), sees over 40 instances in the zero-error category, with a tighter error spread, suggesting enhanced accuracy. The 20% moisture level (Fig. 18(c)), depicts around 50 instances near zero error, with a slight broadening in the error range to -0.02 to +0.02. The 30% moisture level (Fig. 18(d)), also shows around 50 instances at zero error but with a wider distribution, indicating an increase in prediction variability as the moisture content rises.\nThis ANN exhibits a potent capacity for accurate soil salinity prediction, with its performance reflected in the high R\u00b2 values, low MSEs, and concentrated error distributions around zero. Nevertheless, the subtle increase in error spread at higher moisture contents suggests a need for further model refinement."}, {"title": "V.

The decision is given whether the soil is good or bad for watermelon production. Based on the decision, some suggestions are also displayed on the application. The readings from the system are compared with laboratory analyzed readings of the same soil to validate the IoT system's accuracy. Also, during comparison, readings acquired by some field meters and sensors are used. In the comparison, the results achieved by each strategy are almost identical. Most soil sensors leverage the electrical characteristics of soil. So, a relationship between soil resistivity and soil salinity has been established using mathematical equations as well as ANN models. Utilizing this relationship, soil salinity has been determined by the electrical resistivity of the soil, which would help to determine the quality of the soil. This effective and resilient approach to soil characterization is beneficial to increasing production, minimizing the wastage of natural resources, and reducing the hassles for farmers."}]}

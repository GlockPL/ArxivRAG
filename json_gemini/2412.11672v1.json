For instance, adverse weather conditions can\nthreaten the stability of drone flights, thereby increasing the risk of delivery fail-\nure and operational inefficiencies [13,10]. To ensure reliable drone operations, it\nbecomes imperative for systems to have the capability to adapt in real-time to\nsuch uncertainties [8,9].\nOne of the immediate challenges of DaaS platforms is making sense of user\nrequests, often in unstructured natural language. Customers usually provide the\ndelivery information in free-text form, which results in a mismatch between such\ninputs and the structured data needed for efficient drone operations [5,14].\nBridging this gap is important to automate DaaS tasks and enhance the\nefficiency of operations. Toward this, we propose LLM-DaaS, a new Drone-as-\na-Service framework that uses LLMs for converting free-text user requests into\nstructured and actionable drone operation tasks [3].\nOur system revolves around three main components. First, we introduce an\nLLM-driven request processing engine that interprets user text inputs, extract-\ning key information such as delivery time, source, and destination locations, and\npackage weight. Second, we incorporate a dynamic DaaS selection and compo-\nsition model that matches the optimal drone(s) based on the structured request\nfor seamless and efficient package deliveries [2].\nLastly, the system includes real-time meteorological data to enhance the plan-\nning and scheduling of drone routes in order to increase safety and efficiency\nunder uncertain weather conditions [8,13,6].\nThis work assesses the performance of the LLM-DaaS framework for un-\nstructured text query-to-structured drone task conversion, coupled with sim-\nulated DaaS service that showcases its capability in adapting to on-the-spot\nweather variations. Key metrics including end-to-end time and distance traveled\nare discussed and compared."}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": "Use of Drone-as-a-Service DaaS, in commercial and industrial applications, has\nwitnessed extensive research in improving operational efficiency and dealing with\nuncertainties such as dynamic weather conditions and environments. Therefore,\nthis section is going to review state-of-the-art in drone operations, request pro-\ncessing through Large Language Models LLMs, and adaptive path planning rel-\nevant to our study.\nManaging such uncertainties, such as weather conditions and battery lim-\nitations, becomes a very important challenge for DaaS. Hamdi [8] introduced\nuncertainty-aware DaaS composition, enabling drones to adjust their flight paths\ndynamically according to environmental conditions. Similarly, Jiang et al. [12]\nstudied drone flight scheduling under uncertainty, mainly on battery manage-\nment and how the weather conditions of wind and temperature would affect\nthe flight performance. Patel et al. [13] further explore how uncertain weather\nimpacts drone operations, highlighting the requirement for real-time weather\nadaptation in path planning. These studies, taken together, show the impor-\ntance of adaptive algorithms in ensuring safe and reliable drone operations in\nuncertain environments [1].\nAlthough Data-as-a-Service systems heavily depend on structured data to\nperform any operation, processing free-text user requests is a very serious chal-\nlenge. Recent research shows great potential in using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) in automating customer interaction and management of free-text sub-\nmissions.\nWright et al. [5] demonstrated that LLMs can produce structured outputs\nfor natural language input from users. Again, Anderson et al. [14] automate the\nprocess of developing task-oriented LLM-based chatbots for a range of domains.\nAlso, Wang et al. [3] benchmarked the systems powered by LLMs but focused\non metrics for the evaluation of their performance.\nOur work extends these ideas to apply LLMs to the processing of DaaS-\nspecific requests, such as extracting key details including delivery time, source,\ndestination location, and payload weight from free-text inputs enabling seam-\nless automation of request handling, a key gap in current DaaS frameworks [16].\nSwarm-based drone systems have been proposed to make the DaaS more effi-\ncient by collaboration. Lin et al. [1] presented a Swarm-based DaaS framework,\nenabling multiple drones to cooperate in package delivery tasks. Gupta et al.\n[17] researched the integration of neural networks to perform path planning in\ncomplicated scenarios, further increasing the operations of drones in uncertain\nenvironments. Such an approach works well for complex tasks, but our focus in\nthis work is on the optimization of individual drone operations with LLMs to\nautomate free-text request handling. Moreover, LLMs have been integrated into\ncustomer-facing systems, for example, CRM [11], in order to improve customer\ncommunication during the delivery of service. We extend this use of LLMs to\napply them to every step in transforming free-text requests into structured drone\ntasks in order to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction [4]."}, {"title": "3 DaaS Problem Formulation", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 DaaS Service Model", "content": "The DaaS service model is defined as\n$DaaS = (W, P, I)$\nwhere:\nW is a set of real-time weather conditions:\n$W = (T,WS,WD, H, P\\rangle$\nwith:\n\u2022 T - Temperature at a specific location,\n\u2022 WS - Wind Speed,"}, {"title": "3.2 Real-Time weather adaptation", "content": "Real-time weather data forms the basis of the DaaS system. The system enables\nthe efficient and safe operation of drones in the face of very dynamic and un-\npredictable conditions. Weather plays a large role in the performance and safety\nof flights; thus, the system must be able to make quick adaptations to changing\nconditions. The system uses meteorological data, which is stored in CSV files\nand encompasses much information on temperature, wind speed, humidity, and\nprecipitation for different geographical areas. The weather adaptation module\nreads this information, which the system uses to modify the paths and speeds of\nthe drones according to the change in conditions. The main components of the\nadaptation include:\nDynamic Route Adjustment: The system is supposed to monitor the main\nmeteorological parameters continuously, such as wind speed and direction,\ntemperature, humidity, and precipitation. When the detection of bad weather\nhappens, pathfinding algorithms like A* or Dijkstra's algorithm are used to\ncalculate an alternative route for the drone to fly around dangerous areas or\nless desirable paths.\nVelocity Variations: Meteorological conditions can quite drastically affect the\nvelocity and stability of an unmanned aerial vehicle. For instance, strong\nwinds may decelerate a drone or even break the stability of its flight. The\nsystem adjusts the velocity of the drone depending on the weather conditions\nto efficiently ensure safe navigation."}, {"title": "3.3 Drone Fleet and Skyway Network", "content": "The drone fleet is operated within a controlled aerial transportation system\nwhereby a network of delivery stations are linked to each other by predefined\nroutes.

The model includes realistic geographical con-\nstraints for different regions; every station or waypoint has specific geographic\ncoordinates assigned to it, hence allowing exact control over route optimization\nby following airspace constraints and regional legislation.\nAll simulated flights are stored in individual flight logs, which include details\nof each trip segment, including data such as distance traveled, flight duration,\nremaining battery capacity, and maintenance status. Such extensive data col-\nlection ensures that all aspects of drone operation are monitored, thus allowing\nassessment of performance under different environmental conditions.\nAdditionally, when there are complications like route disturbances or main-\ntenance that needs to be carried out, these are all recorded along with corre-\nsponding error messages, which are then used to simulate and test error handling\nwithin the DaaS system. Long-term system performance is assessed by dividing\nthe simulation into monthly-sized time slots over a period of four years. Each\nslot represents unique combinations of meteorological conditions and operational\nscenarios to simulate seasons, peak-demand periods, and service disruptions. In\nthis way, the simulation will be able to explain trends in resource usage, deliv-\nery completion rates, and maintenance needs under more realistic and dynamic\nconditions. The monthly collected data allows for analyzing over time several\nparameters like battery degradation, recurrent faults, or optimal flight paths.\nAs such, this simulation data provides a wide base for analyzing the efficiency,\nreliability, and resilience of DaaS systems under different operating conditions.\nThis long-term data allows for trend analysis and further refinement of drone\nperformance models to continue the optimization of the skyway network for\nDaaS operations over time."}, {"title": "4 LLM DaaS", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 LLM Finetuning", "content": "The LLM component is, in essence, central to the ability of the system to under-\nstand free-form, unstructured human input and to convert that into actionable,\nstructured delivery requests. In the proposed system, users submit natural lan-\nguage inputs that contain delivery requirements including pickup location, des-\ntination, and package weight. The LLM understands the input and converts it\naccordingly. The conversion takes place in a multi-step process. First, the LLM\nanalyzes and partitions the input to identify and extract key entities, such as\naddresses, package information, and time constraints. Using the contextual in-\nformation and predefined rules, it maps these entities to specific fields needed\nby the DaaS framework for the operation of a drone in pickup, destination, and\npayload. Upon completion of text processing, the extracted information is struc-\ntured in a formalized delivery request format. This format is suitable for the\nDaaS model, where the drone resources are managed, navigation is taken care\nof, and task allocation happens. The formalized request is then pushed to the\ncore modules of the system, which can determine the optimal route, assess mete-\norological conditions, and allocate drones accordingly. Such an approach by LLM\nwould make the system friendlier, allowing for easy interaction with nontechnical\nusers and a backend that could work well because of the well-structured inputs."}, {"title": "4.2 Data Collection", "content": "Fine-tuning the LLM models for structured data generation; hence, this paper\nproposed a two-step process in this regard."}, {"title": "4.3 Formulating Delivery Request using LLM", "content": "To better understand how LLMs do in translating free-text requests from users\ninto structured operations (DaaS), we evaluate their performance with a few\nexperiments. The complete process is delineated below:\n1. Preliminary Test: The LLMs are first fine-tuned and tested using 1,000\nfree-text requests. The notion is to check their efficiency in the accurate\ntranslation of the requests into structured delivery requests.

Fine-Tuning: Each LLM is fine-tuned on a training dataset consisting of\n4,000 free-text requests along with their corresponding structured outputs.\nIn this step, the models are expected to learn the specific mapping between\nthe user inputs and the structured data necessary to drive DaaS successfully.\n3. Post-Fine-Tuning Evaluation: We re-evaluated all LLMs after fine-tuning\non the same set of 1,000 test requests to measure any improvement in their\nperformance. This evaluation aimed to quantify the enhancements achieved\nthrough the fine-tuning process.\n4. Evaluation Metric: The G-Eval metric was used for evaluation, relying\non chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs. This allows nuanced assess-\nment of the model outputs against custom criteria, enabling us to not only\njudge surface-level accuracy but also contextual understanding and logical\ncoherence in converting the user's inputs into structured DaaS operations.\n5.

In that respect, the system has an advanced\nevaluation process through which it selects for every delivery task the most\nappropriate drone(s) from the fleet. The system considers a set of parameters\nto ensure that the selected drone will properly execute the delivery task; these\ninclude:\nBattery Life and Health Status: All drones have an operating time limit\ndepending on the battery capacity of the drone. The system checks the re-\nmaining battery life of the assigned drones, ensuring that the drone has more\nthan enough to complete the delivery without an unplanned recharge.\nPayload Capacity: Drones have different payload capacities that determine\ntheir ability to carry packages with regards to size and weight.\nFlight Speed and Range: Drones have varying speeds and ranges of opera-\ntion. The selection system takes this into consideration to match the drone's\ncapability with the delivery payload.\nThe Composition capability of the system allows it to coordinate multiple\ndrones for more complex delivery tasks or longer routes. For example, when the\ndelivery covers a longer distance or has multiple points for delivery, the sys-\ntem will use drones intelligently to offload or exchange packages at intermediate\nnodes. The system hence has increased efficiency and reliability of delivery, since\nit can dynamically reassign packages to more suitable drones in midroute, taking\ninto consideration the state of each drone's battery life, health status, speed, and\nlocal weather conditions.

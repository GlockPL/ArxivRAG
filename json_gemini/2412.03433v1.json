An increasing number of scenarios now require autonomous control of multiple UAVs, as autonomous operation can significantly reduce labor costs. Additionally, obtaining optimal flight paths can lower energy consumption, thereby extending battery life for other critical operations. Many of these scenarios, however, involve obstacles such as power lines and trees, which complicate Path Planning. This paper presents an evolutionary computation-based system employing genetic algorithms to address this problem in environments with obstacles. The proposed approach aims to ensure complete coverage of areas with fixed obstacles, such as in field exploration tasks, while minimizing flight time\u2014regardless of map size or the number of UAVs in the swarm. No specific goal points or prior information beyond the provided map is required. The experiments conducted in this study used five maps of varying sizes and obstacle densities, as well as a control map without obstacles, with different numbers of UAVs. The results demonstrate that this method can determine optimal paths for all UAVs during full map traversal, thus minimizing resource consumption. A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art approach is presented to highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed method.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "A variety of industrial and emergency problems are being solved using swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as highlighted in recent studies (Albani et al., 2017; Huuskonen and Oksanen, 2018; Corte et al., 2020; Bocchino et al., 2018; Rabinovitch et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2018). UAVs have gained popularity due to several factors, including their cost-effectiveness, excellent mobility, operational safety, and compact size, which is particularly advantageous for specific maneuvers (Yeaman and Yeaman, 1998). Furthermore, the wide range of UAV models available on the market enhances their versatility, as they can be equipped with various types of sensors tailored to diverse applications. In particular, sensor development for UAVs has become increasingly significant, especially in the field of remote sensing (Noor et al., 2018). Thanks to their flexible configurations\u2014such as adaptable architectures and sensor payloads\u2014UAVs are now widely employed in numerous fields (Austin, 2011).\nOne major challenge faced by UAVs is their high power consumption, which limits their operational time. Due to their compact size, finding lightweight, high-capacity power sources remains a complex task. However, equipping UAVs with efficient and lightweight power solutions can significantly extend their flight duration while maintaining their operational capa-bilities. This improvement enables longer missions and enhances maneuverability.\nWhen deploying groups or swarms of UAVs, battery limitations can be mitigated. By operating multiple UAVs simultaneously, tasks can be completed more efficiently, as shorter flight paths are required. This reduces the likelihood of individual units depleting their batteries mid-operation. Consequently, energy consumption per UAV decreases, minimizing the risk of mission interruptions or potential failures.\nUAV swarms, like other types of robotic swarms, hold vast potential for real-world applications. The primary advantage of swarm robotics is its in-herent robustness, which can manifest in various ways. Firstly, a swarm consists of numerous simple agents that are not assigned specific roles or responsibilities, enabling self-organization and dynamic reorganization of in-dividual robots' deployment. Furthermore, the swarm approach is highly resilient to individual agent failures due to its distributed control; there is no single point of failure or vulnerability. This high level of robustness seen in UAV swarms is an inherent feature of swarm robotics, unlike the signifi-"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "In the current state-of-the-art, two main research categories are promi-nent: Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton and Barto, 2018) and Evolution-ary Computation (EC) (Holland, 1992), as highlighted by Puente-Castro et al. (2021). Each approach offers distinct methodologies for addressing the Path Planning Problem, particularly in complex environments such as those in-volving UAV swarms.\nAn example of Reinforcement Learning is presented by Qiu et al. (2022), who employ an Actor-Critic RL system to manage multiple UAVs simul-taneously, where each UAV relies solely on locally available environmental"}, {"title": "3. Materials and Method", "content": "The primary objective of this study is to develop a system that addresses the Path Planning Problem Aggarwal and Kumar (2020) for UAV swarms in environments with obstacles. Effective Path Planning in scenarios involving multiple UAVs requires the consideration of various factors to ensure efficiency, control, robust collaboration, and safety. Addressing these challenges is critical to achieving the study's objectives.\nPath Planning is conceptualized here as a combination of interrelated problems, a perspective widely recognized in the literature (Puente-Castro et al., 2022). Consequently, the Path Planning problem is structured into the fol-lowing key areas:\n\u2022 Definition of Flight Maps\n\u2022 UAV Movement Dynamics\n\u2022 Design of the Proposed Model\n\u2022 Model Optimization\n\u2022 Evaluation Metrics for Model Performance"}, {"title": "3.1. Problem Formulation", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2. Genetic Algorithms", "content": "The calculation of flight paths is performed using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) (Holland, 1984). These algorithms simulate a population of poten-tial solutions, where each solution evolves through selection, crossover, and mutation, mimicking the process of natural selection. The most adapted individuals represent the best solutions to the problem.\nIn a GA, each solution is encoded as an individual in a population, with the solution represented by a genotype typically a string of binary or real values. An initial population is generated, and a crossover rate is defined, determining the probability that two individuals will combine their genotypes to produce offspring. Parent selection for crossover is guided by a satisfaction criterion, ensuring controlled population growth and diversity."}, {"title": "3.3. Maps", "content": "To evaluate the proposed approach, six different maps with varying topolo-gies were used, selected to reflect diverse scenarios and to highlight potential limitations of the method. The chosen topologies include various obstacle arrangements to test the algorithm's robustness and adaptability, as detailed in Sections 3.5 and the results section.\nEach map is represented as a grid of cells, allowing UAVs to perform movements between contiguous cells. This grid-based representation simpli-fies Path Planning by discretizing the continuous environment into manage-able units. Each UAV has four possible discrete movements: up, down, left, and right. This simplification ignores complex maneuvers, such as diagonal movements or altitude changes, focusing solely on horizontal and vertical coverage in order to get a more precise metri for evaluating the results.\nThe map set was designed with increasing complexity to evaluate the system's scalability and robustness (Puente-Castro et al., 2024):\n\u2022 Map 1: A 7x7 cell grid without obstacles, representing the simplest scenario for evaluating the baseline performance of the algorithm.\n\u2022 Map 2 (Figure 1(a)): A smaller map with central obstacles and 21 visitable cells, requiring UAVs to travel previously traversed paths, testing the algorithm's ability to handle revisits.\n\u2022 Map 3 (Figure 1(b)): Contains multiple corners, increasing the dif-ficulty of coverage planning, especially when fewer UAVs are deployed. It has 28 visitable cells.\n\u2022 Map 4 (Figure 1(c)): Requires revisiting cells to achieve full coverage of 39 visitable cells, representing irregular topologies common in real-world scenarios.\n\u2022 Map 5 (Figure 1(d)): A highly irregular map with numerous corners and 51 visitable cells, introducing significant challenges in coverage optimization."}, {"title": "3.4. Model", "content": "The proposed method employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine each UAV's path, with movements structured in epochs. During each epoch, all UAVs can move to an adjacent cell, with the overall movement speed determined by the slowest UAV in the swarm. This approach ensures syn-chronized operations and avoids desynchronization issues in multi-UAV co-ordination.\nEach gene in a genotype corresponds to a specific UAV's movement at a specific cell during a particular epoch. Before executing the GA, the possible movements from each cell are precomputed based on the presence of adja-cent obstacles and map boundaries. This precomputation step reduces the computational overhead during GA execution by limiting the search space to"}, {"title": "3.5. Limitations", "content": "A primary limitation arises from constructing a fixed Movement Map for each UAV, which restricts their ability to revisit cells using different move-ment paths. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when UAVs encounter dead ends, as observed in Map 5, where some UAVs may halt prematurely due to the lack of alternative movement options. While one possible solution involves evolving additional Movement Maps to provide al-ternative paths, this study addresses such limitations by leveraging the use of multiple UAVs to achieve complete map coverage. Simulations with a single UAV are included for comparative purposes to highlight the effectiveness of multi-UAV coordination in mitigating these issues."}, {"title": "4. Results", "content": "A significant number of experiments were conducted using the maps de-scribed in Section 3.3, in conjunction with varying quantities of UAVs and different hyperparameter settings for the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The pri-mary objective of these experiments was to evaluate the system's perfor-mance across diverse scenarios, ensuring the robustness and adaptability of the proposed method.\nTo systematically investigate the effects of these factors, a comprehensive grid search methodology was employed. This approach explored all possible combinations of hyperparameters, allowing for a thorough assessment of the GA's behavior and its ability to optimize UAV Path Planning in different configurations. The experiments aimed to identify optimal settings for each combination of map topology and UAV count, as well as to examine the interaction between these parameters.\nThe experimental configurations can be categorized into two main groups:\n\u2022 Map Configurations: Variations in map size, obstacle placement.\n\u2022 GA Configurations: Variations in key hyperparameters.\nTable 2 summarizes these configurations, providing an overview of the parameter space explored during the grid search. The experimental results offer insights into how the combination of map configurations and GA hy-perparameters affects the efficiency, coverage, and computational cost of the proposed system.\nThe map configurations consist of the six aforementioned maps, each paired with a varying number of UAVs ranging from 1 to 4. This results in a total of 24 distinct map configurations, covering a diverse set of scenarios in terms of map complexity and swarm size. These configurations were designed to systematically test the algorithm's adaptability to different environmental challenges and UAV swarm dynamics."}, {"title": "5. Conclusions", "content": "This study has demonstrated the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) in determining UAV paths with the primary objective of achieving complete terrain coverage. Additionally, a secondary objective of minimizing flight time, quantified as the number of UAV movements required, was also addressed. To this end, six distinct maps with varying levels of complexity were designed, a tailored Genetic Algorithm was developed, and an extensive set of experiments was conducted.\nThe experimental results highlight the robustness and versatility of the proposed GA-based approach. For each map configuration (defined by the map topology and the number of UAVs), a large number of GA configura-tions were evaluated, and numerous configurations successfully achieved full terrain coverage. Furthermore, the secondary objective of minimizing flight time was consistently met in most scenarios. By calculating the theoretical lower bound of the optimal number of movements prior to the experiments, it was observed that the proposed method reached this optimal value in many cases. For simpler maps, such as Maps 1 and 3, the optimal number of move-ments was achieved in nearly all successful runs due to their straightforward topology, which allowed full coverage without revisiting cells.\nFor more complex maps, where revisiting cells is necessary due to their topology, the method achieved solutions that closely approached the optimal value, demonstrating its efficiency even under challenging conditions. For the most complex maps, the results show that the GA method consistently"}, {"title": "6. Future Work", "content": "As explained several times in the paper, this system has a limitation that has been deliberately left in order to study the exploration of complex maps. As a first future work that can be derived from this, a similar system could be developed that would allow a UAV to visit cells that have been previously traversed. To this end, one possibility would be to make the genotype of an individual AG contain not just one movement map for each UAV, but more than one. In this way, each UAV would have a primary movement map that it would use in the cells it has not visited, and a secondary one that it would use in the cells already visited by itself.\nIn addition, in this work all UAVs have been synchronized in such a way that the movements of all UAVs occur at the same time. If the UAVs have different speeds, this means that when each one leaves its cell to reach the next one, the faster ones will have to wait for the slower ones. One possible future work could be to take advantage of the different speeds to further decrease the time required to traverse the entire map.\nAnother possibility for future work would be to contemplate a more com-plex task for the UAVs, where they would have to traverse the entire map, and then return to the starting point. To do this, it would again be necessary to consider the possibility of using several movement maps for each UAV."}, {"title": "Funding", "content": "This project was supported by the General Directorate of Culture, Ed-ucation, and University Management of Xunta de Galicia (grant number"}, {"title": null, "content": "F(G) =\n{\nepoch,\nif all cells are visited by epoch,\nMaxEpochs + |Ctotal \\ Cvisited, if no UAV moves or MaxEpochs is reached.\n(1)\nCvisited = \\bigcup Cvisit(UAV),\nUAV\n(2)"}]}

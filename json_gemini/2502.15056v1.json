Then, the main properties of biological neural networks are detailed and the results of main works"}, {"title": "II. FUNDAMENTALS OF NEUROMORPHIC ENGINEERING", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Spiking Neural Networks", "content": "The concept of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is rooted in biology, as ANNs have evolved to mimic the physical connections between the neurons in the brain, which communicate to perform functions like information processing and decision-making. However, although resembling their biological counterparts, the artificial neurons employed in ANNs do not precisely replicate their behavior. This discrepancy has prompted the emergence of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Unlike biological neural networks, where impulses are not directly transmitted between neurons but instead involve neurotransmitter exchange, SNNs aim to closely mimic this mechanism. Thus, rather than operating with continuously changing values over time like ANNs, SNNs function with discrete events at specific time points, known as spike trains. At any given moment, each neuron within an SNN holds a value akin to the electrical potential of biological neurons. This value can fluctuate based on the neuron's mathematical model; for instance, receiving a spike from an upstream neuron may cause it to increase or decrease. If this value exceeds a set threshold, the neuron will emit a single impulse to connected downstream neurons. Consequently, the neuron's value rapidly decreases below its average, similar to the refractory period experienced by biological neurons, before gradually returning to its average state over time [1].\nLet i represent a post-synaptic neuron, where $u_{i,t}$ represents its membrane potential, $O_{i,t}$ stands for its spiking activation, and $X$ denotes the leak factor. The index j refers to the pre-synaptic neuron, and the weights $W_{i,j}$ govern the synapse values connecting these neurons [4]. The iterative update of the neuron activation is computed as follows:\n$O_{i,t} = g(\\Sigma (W_{i,j}o_{j,t}) + \\lambda \\cdot U_{i,t-1}$  (1)\nThe function g(x) in (2) acts as a thresholding mechanism, transforming voltage into spikes.\n$g (x) = \\begin{cases}\n    1, & \\text{if } x \\geq U_{th} \\\\\n    0, & \\text{if } x < U_{th}\n\\end{cases}$   (2)\nFollowing the spike, a reset occurs by subtracting Uth from the current membrane potential $u_{it}$, resulting in $U_{it}$ representing the membrane potential after resetting."}, {"title": "B. Models of SNN", "content": ""}, {"title": "1) Hodgkin-Huxley model:", "content": "The Hodgkin-Huxley model [4] is a fundamental mathematical framework used to understand the generation and propagation of electrical signals in neurons, particularly in the context of action potentials. Proposed by British scientists Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952, this model describes how the movement of ions across the neuronal membrane leads to changes in the cell's electrical potential, ultimately resulting in the generation of an action potential. In essence, the Hodgkin-Huxley model depicts neurons as complex electrical circuits with specialized channels for different ions such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. These channels open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential, allowing ions to flow across the membrane in a highly controlled manner. This flow of ions creates electrical currents that drive the dynamics of the neuron's membrane potential over time. The model consists of a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of ion currents and the membrane potential. It incorporates parameters such as membrane capacitance, ion conductances, and reversal potentials, to accurately capture the behavior of real neurons. One of the key insights provided by the Hodgkin-Huxley model is the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of action potentials. By simulating the dynamics of ion channels and membrane potential changes, the model can predict how neurons respond to various stimuli and how signals are transmitted along their length.\nIn the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, the neural membrane is conceptualized as an electrical circuit. The membrane's lipid bilayer is represented as a capacitor, denoted by C, with the membrane potential V serving as the voltage across this capacitor. Ion channels on the membrane, such as those for sodium, potassium, and leakage current, are likened to resistors, designated as $R_N$, $R_K$, and $R_l$ respectively. $R_N$ and $R_K$ resistances may exhibit time-dependent variations, whereas $R_l$ remains constant. Each type of ion possesses an equilibrium potential due to concentration disparities across the membrane. When the membrane potential equals the equilibrium potential of a specific ion, the resultant electric current arising from the movement of ions of that type becomes zero. The equilibrium potentials for sodium, potassium, and leakage current are denoted by $E_N$, $E_K$, and $E_l$, respectively. Upon reaching a certain threshold, the membrane potential triggers the neuron to emit an output spike, known as an action potential, which propagates to downstream neurons before the membrane potential swiftly resets. Following an output spike, the neuron undergoes a refractory period during which it is unresponsive to additional input spikes. The HH model can manifest as point neuron models [5] or more intricate multi-compartment neuron models. In multi-compartment neuron models, the membrane's different segments (compartments) may possess distinct photoelectrical properties. Each compartment can thus be represented by a separate set of differential equations incorporating unique parameter values. The HH model demonstrates"}, {"title": "2) Leaky Integrate and Fire Model:", "content": "The leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model [4] is a simplified mathematical framework used to describe the behavior of neurons in response to incoming electrical signals. In this model, each neuron is conceptualized as an electrical circuit with a leaky capacitor and a threshold for firing. At its core, the neuron's membrane potential is represented as a capacitor that leaks charge over time, akin to a leaking bucket gradually losing water. When the neuron receives input signals, typically in the form of synaptic currents, these signals are integrated or summed over time by the membrane potential. This integration process reflects the neuron's tendency to accumulate electrical charge in response to incoming signals. Once the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, the neuron fires an action potential, or spike, signaling the transmission of information to downstream neurons. This firing event is akin to the overflowing of the leaky capacitor, triggered by the accumulated charge exceeding a critical level. Following a spike, the membrane potential is reset to a resting state, reflecting the discharge of accumulated charge and the refractory period during which the neuron is temporarily unresponsive to further input. Despite its simplicity, the LIF model captures essential aspects of neuronal behavior, including the integration of synaptic inputs and the generation of action potentials. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of neural networks and for simulating large-scale neuronal systems in computational neuroscience research. In LIF model, the neuron will accumulate the potential from the input, once its potential reaches the threshold, the neuron will be fired with a spike [6]."}, {"title": "3) Izhikevich Model:", "content": "The Izhikevich model [4] represents a simplified yet versatile mathematical framework for describing the dynamics of neuronal activity. It was introduced by Eugene Izhikevich as an alternative to more complex models like the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, aiming to strike a balance between biological realism and computational efficiency. The Izhikevich model conceptualizes neurons as dynamic systems governed by a set of nonlinear differential equations. Unlike the HH model, which involves numerous parameters and equations to capture the intricate behavior of ion channels, the Izhikevich model simplifies neuronal dynamics into two equations: one governing the membrane potential and another controlling the recovery variable. Despite its simplicity, the Izhikevich model can replicate various neuronal behaviors observed in biological systems. For example, it can mimic the generation of action potentials, the refractory period following spiking activity, and various firing patterns such as regular spiking, bursting, and fast-spiking. In terms of resemblance to the HH and LIF models, the Izhikevich model shares some similarities. Like the HH model, it can capture nuanced neuronal behaviors and firing patterns, albeit with a simpler mathematical formulation. At the same time, it retains the computational efficiency of the LIF model, making it suitable for simulating large-scale neuronal networks and exploring complex dynamics in neural circuits. The selection of modeling abstraction levels should align with the intended purpose of the simulation. To create efficient simulation tools for neuroscience research, employing more biologically realistic neuron models, such as the HH model, is advisable despite its computational demands. Conversely, if the aim is to develop information processing algorithms and chips based on SNN, simpler neuron models like the LIF, adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdExIF) [7], or Izhikevich models suffice for the task. In this context, additional complexities introduced by more intricate models, such as the HH model, often do not contribute significantly to improving algorithm performance [8]. Overall, the Izhikevich model offers a valuable compromise between biological accuracy and computational tractability, making it a popular choice for studying neuronal dynamics and network behavior in computational neuroscience research."}, {"title": "III. SURVEY OF SOUND CLASSIFICATION USING SNN", "content": "Sound classification using Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) involves a different approach compared to traditional artificial neural networks. SNNs are inspired by the way neurons communicate in the brain, where information is encoded in the timing of spikes, or action potentials, rather than in continuous firing rates. In sound classification, SNNs process audio signals in a manner analogous to how the auditory system operates in the brain. The audio signal is first converted into a format suitable for neural network processing, such as a spike train representation. This conversion can be achieved using techniques like spike encoding, where spikes are generated based on the amplitude and timing of the audio signal. Once the audio signal is encoded into spikes, it is fed into the input layer of the SNN. The SNN then processes these spikes through layers of neurons, with connections between neurons representing synapses. The neurons integrate incoming spikes over time and produce output spikes based on certain firing thresholds. Training an SNN for sound classification typically involves spike-based learning algorithms, such as Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) [4], which adjust the synaptic weights between neurons based on the timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Through this learning process, the SNN learns to distinguish between different sound classes by adjusting its synaptic weights to maximize classification accuracy. One advantage of using SNNs for sound classification is their potential for low-power and event-driven processing, which can be advantageous for energy-efficient implementations in resource-constrained devices. Additionally, SNNs have been shown to exhibit robustness to noise and variability, making them suitable for real-world audio environments.

Overview of Transformer-Based SNN", "content": "Martinelli et al. [9] presents a novel approach to implementing VAD using SNNs trained with backpropagation, aiming for low-power neuromorphic systems. The proposed system leverages the inherent parallelism and event-driven processing nature of SNNs, which can lead to significant reductions in power consumption compared to traditional digital implementations. The core of the proposed method lies in the training process of SNNs using backpropagation, a technique widely employed in conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Backpropagation enables the optimization of SNN parameters to accurately classify input audio signals as either containing voice activity or being silent. By iteratively adjusting synaptic weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs, the network learns to discriminate between voice and silence events effectively. One key advantage of using SNNs for VAD is their ability to process input signals in real-time while consuming minimal power. Unlike traditional VAD algorithms that operate on frames of audio data, SNNs can operate asynchronously, reacting to input events as they occur. This event-driven processing enables efficient utilization of computational resources, further reducing power consumption. The authors experimentally validate the proposed approach using benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately detecting voice activity with low power consumption. By leveraging the capabilities of neuromorphic hardware platforms, such as spike-based processors or specialized neuromorphic chips, the proposed SNN-based VAD system shows promise for deployment in energy-constrained environments, such as mobile devices or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

[10] introduces a novel method that combines Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) with back-propagated error signals for training SNNs specifically tailored for audio classification tasks. STDP is a biologically inspired learning rule where synaptic strengths are modified based on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. While STDP is well-suited for unsupervised learning in SNNs, it cannot handle supervised tasks such as audio classification, where explicit error signals are needed to guide learning. The proposed approach addresses this limitation by incorporating back-propagated error signals into the STDP learning rule. This is achieved by leveraging a hybrid learning framework combining the benefits of STDP and backpropagation, a widely used supervised learning algorithm in conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). During training, the SNN receives input spike patterns representing audio features and generates spike trains responding to these inputs. These spikes propagate through the network, and the synaptic strengths are adjusted based on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes according to the STDP rule. However, in addition to the STDP-driven weight updates, error signals computed using backpropagation are also utilized to modulate the learning process. By back-propagating error signals through the network, the SNN learns to adjust its spike timing and synaptic weights to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and target outputs, thus enabling supervised learning for audio classification tasks. This hybrid learning scheme combines the biologically plausible aspects of STDP with the powerful learning capabilities of backpropagation, resulting in improved performance and efficiency for training SNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for audio classification tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to conventional ANNs while offering the advantages of spiking neural networks, such as event-driven processing and low power consumption."}, {"title": "B.

{"title": "Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical Systems Using Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, Digital Twins, and Large Language Model", "authors": ["Reachsak Ly", "Alireza Shojaei"], "abstract": "Current autonomous building research primarily focuses on energy efficiency and automation. While traditional artificial intelligence has advanced autonomous building research, it often relies on predefined rules and struggles to adapt to complex, evolving building operations. Moreover, the centralized organizational structures of facilities management also hinder transparency in decision-making in the building operation management process, which limits the true building autonomy. Research on decentralized governing and adaptive building infrastructure, which could overcome these challenges, remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel Decentralized Autonomous Building Cyber-Physical System framework that integrates Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and digital twin to create a smart, self-managed, operational, and financially autonomous building infrastructure. This approach aims to enhance adaptability, enable decentralized decision-making, and achieve both operational and financial autonomy in building management. This study develops a full-stack decentralized application (Dapp) to facilitate decentralized governance of building infrastructure. An LLM-based artificial intelligence assistant is developed to provide intuitive human-building interaction for blockchain and building operation management-related tasks and enable autonomous building operation. The framework is validated through prototype implementation in a real-world building, with evaluations focusing on workability, cost, scalability, data security, privacy, and integrity. Six real-world scenarios were tested to evaluate the autonomous building system's workability, including building revenue and expense management, Al-assisted facility control, and autonomous adjustment of building systems. Results indicate that the prototype successfully executes these operations, confirming the framework's suitability for developing building infrastructure with decentralized governance and autonomous operation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Research on autonomous buildings has become a promising frontier in the field of smart and sustainable infrastructure. Autonomous buildings are characterized by their ability to operate independently through self-management, self-sufficiency, and intelligent operation. These buildings leverage a combination of advanced technologies to monitor, control, and automate the system's operation, reducing reliance on external resources and enhancing sustainability and efficiency. Existing research on autonomous buildings has primarily concentrated on achieving maximum energy efficiency, net-zero energy status, and ensuring energy self-sufficiency and off-grid performance. These objectives are undoubtedly crucial and have yielded significant advancements in the research on sustainable building operations. While energy autonomy [1] is crucial, it represents just one dimension of the overarching goal of achieving a comprehensive autonomous building infrastructure. To achieve operational autonomy within the building, researchers have further explored the integration of several advanced technologies, including building automation systems, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and digital twins, to enhance building intelligence and autonomy in facilities management by enhancing various building operation and system such as HVAC, lighting, energy management, etc. [2], [3], [4].\nMachine learning techniques and Al have played a pivotal role in enabling these advancements. Their capacity to analyze large volumes of data, recognize trends, and make well-informed choices has contributed significantly to improving energy efficiency, enhancing occupant comfort, and optimizing building performance. However, the functionality of this conventional machine learning model may rely on predefined rules or specific training data, which, in some circumstances, may not adequately capture the dynamic and complex nature of building operations. Furthermore, they often struggle to adapt to evolving circumstances or incorporate contextual information effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue to overcome these limitations and unlock a new realm of possibilities for autonomous building operations. LLMs exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, which could enable seamless human-machine interactions and intelligent decision-making processes. Unlike conventional Al models, LLMs possess a deep understanding of contextual information and can engage in human-like conversations, allowing for more intuitive and adaptive control of building systems. Moreover, LLMs have the potential to facilitate complex decision-making processes by integrating multiple data streams, analyzing scenarios from diverse perspectives, and providing well-reasoned recommendations and adjustments to the building system. Its human-like reasoning capabilities can open up new avenues for human-building interaction research and enhancement of the building infrastructure autonomy.\nFurthermore, the rise of Web3 technologies with the emergence of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) [5], such as blockchain technology [6] and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), [7] has introduced new paradigms of decentralized governance and decentralized finance (DeFi) in the built environment, which hold significant potential for enhancing the overall autonomy of building systems [8]. Blockchain (BC) is a digital public ledger that has all its data documented and stored in a transparent and tamper-resistant manner in a decentralized network. In addition, DAO is a digital and community-driven entity running on a blockchain network that functions transparently and autonomously with democratic and collective decision-making capabilities among its members [9]. In addition to being energy self-sufficient, multiple research studies suggest that next-generation building infrastructure also needs to become both operationally and financially autonomous with the capability of decentralized self-governance and self-ownership to become fully autonomous. For instance, Chang and Joha [10] also introduced the concept of 'common infrastructure,' a social practice that emphasizes collaborative production, sharing, and maintenance of resources within building infrastructure. They proposed the idea of a civic, self-owned, and autonomous infrastructure with blockchain technology to promote inclusivity and reduce the need for direct ownership and control over the building infrastructure. Wang et al. [8] also proposed the engineered ownership concept by proposing a blockchain-based system with automation capabilities with distributed rights and power shared between autonomous agents in building infrastructure. Similarly, Hunhevicz et al. [11] have also contributed to the research on the self-governing of physical space by proposing the concept and prototypes of decentralized autonomous space (DAS) using DAO.\nHowever, previous works on self-governing infrastructure have yet to incorporate advanced technologies such as digital twin and Al into their proposed decentralized systems. Specifically, the research on the integration of DLT with digital twins and LLMs in the context of physical infrastructure remains unexplored. By integrating the context-aware capabilities and human-like intelligence of LLM with the decentralized governance and self-ownership framework offered by DLT, researchers can potentially explore new frontiers in building autonomy research and pave the way for the creation of a decentralized and self-governed, intelligent, and sustainable, autonomous building infrastructure."}, {"title": "Literature review", "content": null}, {"title": "Overview of Decentralized Autonomous Organization", "content": "A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a novel organizational structure built on blockchain technology, characterized by its community-driven governance, transparent operations, and autonomous execution of decisions. DAOs function as digital entities operating on a decentralized blockchain network, enabling collective decision-making processes among their members while adhering to predefined rules encoded in smart contracts [7]. Smart contracts are self-executing programs implemented on the blockchain that activate automatically when certain predefined conditions are satisfied [12]. This innovative approach to organizational governance fundamentally diverges from traditional centralized structures, introducing a paradigm shift towards decentralized and autonomous operations.\nOne of the earliest and most well-known implementations of DAO was \"The DAO,\" which was launched on the Ethereum network in 2016. Although it was eventually hacked and shut down, it sparked significant interest and paved the way for further exploration and development of DAO applications. As of June 2024, DeepDao analytics [13] reports a total of 2,437 active DAOs with around 3.2 million active weekly users, which collectively manage approximately $30 billion worth of blockchain assets. These DAOs engage 3.2 million active users weekly. Among these organizations, 213 DAOs hold treasuries exceeding $1 million, 113 DAOs have assets over $10 million, and 36 DAOs manage funds surpassing $100 million.\nDAOs are built upon three fundamental principles: decentralization, autonomy, and automation [7]. In contrast to hierarchical management systems, DAOs employ a decentralized network architecture, which eliminates the centralized governing body [14]. In addition, governance within a DAO occurs through a democratic process, where community members collectively participate and vote on proposals [15]. Approved proposals are then autonomously executed by the smart contracts, ensuring consistent and transparent implementation of the collective decisions. Furthermore, the immutable and transparent characteristics of blockchain technologies allow DAOs to automate organizational processes and transactions through predefined rules encoded in smart contracts, fostering trust and accountability [16].\nThe governance process within a DAO typically involves the submission of proposals by community members, followed by a voting process where token holders can cast their votes. Once the voting period concludes, the proposal is either accepted or rejected based on the predetermined voting rules and thresholds. Accepted proposals are then automatically executed by the smart contracts, ensuring transparency and adherence to the agreed-upon rules.\nIn recent years, DAOs have attracted growing research interest within industry and academia across various disciplines, including decentralized finance (DeFi) [17], healthcare [18], and education [19]. However, there have been DAO implementations for decentralized governance in the built environment, especially in the building infrastructure domain."}, {"title": "Integration of DAOs and artificial intelligence", "content": "The idea of integrating Al and DAOs for decentralized governance was proposed by McConaghy, [20] where he explored the potential of Al DAOs and their societal implications. The synergy of artificial intelligence (AI) and DAOs holds immense potential to revolutionize decision-making processes, solve governance-related challenges, and unlock new opportunities across various domains, including the built environment. Traditional DAOs operate based on predefined smart contract codes and voting mechanisms. However, by leveraging the ability of adaptive machine learning and feedback loops, Al-powered DAOs can learn, make decisions, and automate administrative tasks that are typically performed by humans [21].\nExperts and researchers have explored various scenarios of Al and DAO integration to illustrate their potential symbiotic relationship and practical applications (Fig. 1). Revoredo [22] presents different AI DAO use cases such as managing blockchain treasuries and assets, leveraging swarm intelligence for meta-governance, smart contracts automation, assisting DAO governance, and Al-generated content or services for DAO. One notable example is Singularity DAO, which leverages Al to facilitate asset management and investment decisions based on user behavior analysis [23]. In the realm of smart transportation, scholars suggest the use of intelligent agent networks to coordinate and optimize autonomous mobility systems through collaborative decision-making [24]. Furthermore, within the domain of smart cities, researchers have also proposed the integration of DAOs and parallel systems to facilitate the deployment of Al applications [25], by fusing the physical and virtual environments with spatial symbiotic intelligence, an integrated and collaborative DAO-Al decision-making system could be created to address the diverse needs of city residents more effectively [26]. Moreover, generative Al has been successfully integrated with DAOs to create self-sustaining digital organizations whose revenue is generated by Al-generated content. For instance, the works by Yadlapalli et al. [27] harnessed the potential of combining Al and DAOs by creating a digital, self-governing organization that sustains itself through the revenue generated from selling digital art automatically created by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Similarly, Guo et al. [28] integrated artificial intelligence and DAOs to build a human-machine collaborative painting system for artistic content creation, further demonstrating the synergies between these two technologies. However, despite these advancements, there are a few research gaps that need to be addressed. First, most previous research has primarily focused on using Al to power DAO-related products and services through content generation or service provision. None have effectively utilized Al as a tool for assisting the DAO governance process. The few studies that have explored this area have only proposed conceptual frameworks but have yet to conduct empirical implementation. Furthermore, the integration of advanced Al models like LLMs with DAOs has yet to be explored. This presents a unique opportunity to investigate how LLMs can enhance DAO governance, decision-making processes, and overall efficiency. Addressing these gaps could pave the way for more sophisticated, intelligent, and autonomous decentralized systems."}, {"title": "Application of Large language model in construction industry", "content": "Large language models have emerged as a major advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP) by revolutionizing the way humans interact with computer systems. These models are trained on large amounts of data, which allows them to comprehend and generate human-like language with remarkable fluency and coherence. Among the most prominent LLMs, OpenAl's ChatGPT has garnered significant attention due to its impeccable performance in information extraction and text summarization. These models leverage transformer-based architectures that are capable of learning patterns of natural language, which allow the generation of contextually relevant and coherent text by providing prompts that combine task instructions with selected contextual examples. A primary benefit of GPT models is their ability to generate language that closely resembles text written by humans. This has opened up a wide range of applications, such as chatbots and natural language communication, where these models can provide accurate and human-like responses to open-ended queries.\nThe capability and application of LLM have gained significant attention from researchers in the construction domain in the past few years. As a result, several studies have been conducted to explore the application of LLM in various stages of the construction project lifecycle, including project planning, construction, operations, and maintenance. For instance, in the project planning phase, a study by Prieto et al. [29] examines the use of LLM in construction schedule generation based on the project scopes and requirements. The findings show that the LLM developed a structured schedule that adopts a logical framework to meet the specified scope requirements. Within the construction phase, researchers have also explored the use of LLM in the construction robotics domain. You et al. [30] introduced RoboGPT, a novel system that utilizes the reasoning abilities of ChatGPT for automating sequence planning in robot-assisted assembly for construction tasks. Experimental evaluations and case studies demonstrated that RoboGPT-enabled robots could manage complicated construction operations and adapt to real-time changes. Additionally, LLM has also been used in the construction safety domain. Chen et al. [31] proposed a construction safety query system, which combines image captioning with a visual question-answering capability on head-mounted AR devices by leveraging vision language models such as ChatGPT 4. The system allows construction workers to query safety-related information by capturing images and asking questions through natural language interaction, thereby improving safety inspection, compliance checking, and progress monitoring in construction sites. In another study, Uddin et al. [32] examined the impact of integrating ChatGPT into the construction education curriculum. The investigation involved measuring students' hazard recognition abilities before and after introducing ChatGPT as an educational tool. The results showed significant improvements in hazard recognition, suggesting the potential benefits of integrating LLMs into construction safety education and training. Furthermore, LLM has also been used by researchers to facilitate efficient information search. For instance, Zheng and Fischer [33] introduced an Al-powered virtual assistant system that integrates ChatGPT for supporting natural language-based building information models (BIMs) search. This system allows users to query BIM databases using natural language, extract relevant information, and receive responses along with 3D visualizations.\nWhile previous research has investigated the integration of GPT models in various domains of construction, the application of LLMs in the context of smart building infrastructure remains relatively unexplored. The advanced reasoning capabilities and natural language processing power of LLMs hold significant potential for enhancing automation and intelligent decision-making for smart building operations, as well as facilitating intuitive interaction between occupants and facility management operations. Furthermore, it is important to note that the existing research on the application of LLMs in the construction domain has primarily utilized commercialized GPT models, such as OpenAl's ChatGPT. Saka et al. [34] highlights some key concerns regarding data privacy, cost scalability, and confidentiality issues related to the usage of these models. The use of these cloud-based GPT models requires sensitive data to be transmitted to external servers for processing, potentially exposing it to unauthorized access or data breaches. Another significant challenge lies in the cost and scalability aspects of these commercial LLM services. As an example, users must pay a monthly subscription fee of $20 to access the ChatGPT web interface, which also comes with certain usage limitations. Similarly, the developed applications that use the GPT models API also face recurring charges based on their level of usage. These cost considerations may hinder the broader adoption and scalability of such applications within the construction industry. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative solutions, such as utilizing local and open-source LLMs that can improve inference speed while addressing data privacy concerns, as the data remains localized within the device or system."}, {"title": "Decentralized autonomous organization and self-governing entity.", "content": "In recent years, various studies and prototypes have highlighted the potential of utilizing DAO in the development of web3-inspired autonomous systems and entities. McConaghy [35] is among the earliest to propose the concept of a web3-based self-governing and self-sustaining entity. He envisions a future where the integration of Al with blockchain and DAO creates smart and decentralized self-operated physical world objects such as self-own cars and self-own infrastructure such as highway roads and power grids, etc. Additionally, Wang et al. [8] also developed the concept of engineering ownership, which proposed the idea of a blockchain-based system with automation capabilities with distributed ownership and power shared between autonomous human or machine agents in the building infrastructure domain. Furthermore, in their works, Chang and Joha [10] also introduced the concept of civic and autonomous infrastructure to enhance inclusivity and eliminate the need for centralized ownership and control. They highlight the need to shift from centralized intermediaries, such as traditional financial institutions, to decentralized networks that promote shared governance. This shift is critical for developing infrastructures that are not only self-managed but also self-owned, operating without reliance on any centralized authority by leveraging distributed ledger technology.\nStudies on the application of DAO governance have shown that human and machine agents can collaboratively create a decentralized organizational system that operates autonomously with self-ownership and without centralized control. DAO-powered entities encompass a range of applications, including a self-sustaining, generative Al-powered digital organization [27], [28], decentralized space [11] to an on-chain, and community-governed city [36]. One of the earliest concepts of the web3-based self-governing and self-sustaining entity was first introduced by Seidler et al. [37] in 2016, where they proposed the idea of a self-governing forest that can intelligently exploit its resources by selling its logging license with blockchain's smart contract automation process. In addition, the CityDAO project [36] aims to build a future blockchain-based city by leveraging land tokenization and decentralized governance. Users can purchase certificates to gain citizenship of the land through blockchain tokens to become CityDAO citizens and participate in the governance of the land, such as its policies, regulations, and future developments through the DAO governance.\nIn the context of building infrastructure, Ye et al. [38] have presented a DAO-enabled autonomous building maintenance system where the building operates independently according to predefined rules in smart contracts. The authors gave an exemplary use case where the embedded sensors detect equipment failures and report the issue to the DAO. The DAO then executes the appropriate responses, such as notifying the maintenance team and procuring replacement parts based on the programmed smart contract rules. The research on autonomous entities was further advanced in 2022 with the introduction of the No1s1 project, [11] where the authors have developed a prototype of a self-governing meditation space based on blockchain technology. This application demonstrates how DAO can be operated on a physical infrastructure, highlighting the potential for self-operating and self-sustaining physical spaces through smart contract-driven autonomy. However, the prototype lacks the integration of artificial intelligence, which could potentially enhance the autonomy adaptability, decision-making capabilities, and overall intelligence in managing and operating the autonomous systems. Furthermore, Dounas et al. [39] proposed a digital twin and blockchain-integrated system for the AEC industry. This framework also focuses on the utilization of DAO for collaboration between humans and computing agents in future physical infrastructure. Ly et al. [40] further advanced this concept by developing another framework that integrates digital twin and DAO applications to enable data-driven and decentralized governance in smart building facilities management. However, there is a lack of comprehensive empirical investigations into the practical application of this concept in the actual building environment. Therefore, there is a need for further investigation into the integration of Al, digital twins, and DAO alongside its empirical studies within the realm of autonomous building infrastructure."}, {"title": "Research Methodology", "content": "The development of the decentralized autonomous building cyber-physical system (DAB-CPS) adopted the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, a rigorous problem-solving paradigm that emphasizes the iterative process of creating and evaluating innovative artifacts to solve identified problems in real-world contexts [41]. The DSR methodology has been widely adopted by researchers in developing blockchain-based solutions. For instance, Xu et al. [42] utilized the DSR approach to develop a blockchain-based framework aimed at facilitating decentralized carbon management, particularly in the certification of construction materials and products. Similarly, Cheng et al. [43] used DSR to create a blockchain framework for construction cost management, while Elghaish et al. [44] utilized the same methodology for the development of an Al virtual assistant for managing BIM data. The DSR process involves six different stages: (1) Problem identification and motivation, (2) Objective definition, (3) Design and development of the artifact, (4) demonstration of the artifact, (5) evaluation of the artifact, and (6) communicating the results [45]. Fig. 2 presents the development process of the decentralized autonomous building cyber-physical system with the six stages of DSR as follows:\n(1) Problem identification and motivation. The literature review conducted in Section 2 reveals several research gaps, including limited studies on autonomous building infrastructure, lack of research on decentralized governance of building operation and self-owned buildings, lack of Al integration in assisting DAO governance, and the lack of open-source LLM application in the construction industry especially in the smart building domain.\n(2) Objective definition. To address these knowledge gaps, this paper aims to design and develop a decentralized autonomous building cyber-physical system (DAB-CPS) framework that integrates decentralized autonomous organizations and large language models to create a smart and autonomous building infrastructure with Al-enhanced building operation and system control and financially autonomous physical spaces with distributed governance mechanism through DAO-based decentralized governance platform.\n(3) Design and development. The main goal of this study, the development of DAB-CPS, will be achieved through the following objectives. (i) To develop the DAO decentralized governance platform for the operational and treasury management of the physical space (ii) To develop the physical space reservation platform for the users (iii) To create the LLM-based Virtual Assistant (VA) for autonomous smart building control and blockchain or DAO related task execution (iv) Create the LLM-based Al agent for autonomous smart building control, and conduct system performance evaluation (v) To conduct system performance evaluation. Each of these objectives will be discussed in further detail in section 4.\n(4) Demonstration. The developed system mentioned above will be deployed in the actual physical building space to create a prototype of the DAB-CPS framework. Different scenarios of the system capabilities will be demonstrated, including the management of the decentralized governance platform, usage of the space reservation system, and the demo of the Al virtual assistant for blockchain and DAO-related-task execution, as well as the Al agent for smart building system control.\n(5) Evaluation. A real case study in a smart building will be provided to simulate the proposed system in a realistic setting. The evaluations of the DAB-CPS framework are presented in Section 5.\n(6) Communication. The design and development methodology of the proposed DAB-CPS system and prototype, as well as the evaluation results, will be published in international academic journals."}, {"title": "Proposed DAB-CPS framework", "content": null}, {"title": "Framework overview", "content": "In this study, we propose the concept of a decentralized autonomous building cyber-physical system (DAB-CPS), which is referred to as a web3 and Al-enabled, community-governed building infrastructure that functions autonomously with blockchain-based self-management protocols. The proposed framework aims to create a self-governing, autonomous building infrastructure leveraging blockchain technology, DAOs, and LLMs model-powered building automation systems.\nThe DAB-CPS framework will be demonstrated through the development of a decentralized rental space. This decentralized space will be designed to earn blockchain's cryptocurrency or tokens (revenue) in exchange for renting/leasing itself to the users/occupants. The DAO's governance platform will be created to oversee the space's functional operation and financial aspect, including managing its revenue and necessary operational expenses (e.g., maintenance fee, electricity usage, etc.) with DAO treasury and blockchain-based transactions to sustain the system operation.\nThe architecture of this framework and the relationship between different components is also shown in Fig. 3. As depicted, the DAB-CPS framework is divided into two main domains: the Cyber world and the Physical world. The framework's cyber elements comprise different technologies, including blockchain, DAO, Al virtual assistant, and digital twins, while the physical element of the framework includes IoT devices, sensors, physical space, equipment, and human actors. In the physical world, the loT device and sensors continuously monitor environmental conditions, while Raspberry Pi serves as the intermediary between the physical sensors and the cyber system by processing data and transmitting it to the cyber component. These sensor data are then used for digital twin visualization before feeding into the LLM-based Al agent for autonomous building operations management. The threshold values and automation logic of the building facilities are encoded in the blockchain smart contracts, which are managed by the decentralized governance platform. The Al virtual assistant also enhances user interactions with the physical space and supports DAO members in their governance activities.\nThe orange arrows in Fig. 3 represent human interactions with the cyber and physical system, showing how users and DAO members interact with the frontend applications and physical space. The Grey arrows indicate data flow from the Physical World to the Cyber World, including the sensor data transmission via Web3 and REST API. Purple arrows show the system's responses from the Cyber World to the Physical World, such as controlling facilities based on the command and decision from the DAO stakeholders and Al agents. Lastly, the blue arrow demonstrated the communication between the frontend and backend components of the Dapp. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 4, the technical stacks of the DAB-CPS architecture are comprised of six layers. The user layers represent the human actors interacting with the system, which includes both DAO members who participate in governance and regular occupants who use the physical space. The main component of the application layers is the full stack Dapp, which contains key components from different layers, including the decentralized governance platform, space reservations portal, digital building twin visualization portal, and the Al-assistant portal. A Dapp with an interactive graphical user interface will be developed to provide access for the users to rental/booking services, facility control, and live digital twin visualization of the space, as well as offer the stakeholder an interactive platform for the collective governance of the physical space. Furthermore, the blockchain layer serves as the foundation of decentralized and trustless operations of the systems by encompassing the DAO-based decentralized governance platform and the blockchain-based space reservation portal. The decentralized governance platform will enable stakeholders (DAO members) to collectively manage the building operation and policy through DAO's decentralized governance mechanism, such as proposal submission, token-based voting, treasury management, and more. Furthermore, the space reservation portal allows users to reserve and cancel the space through blockchain transactions.\nMoreover, the artificial intelligence layer leverages LLMs to enhance system capabilities. It includes smart assistance for decentralized governance, blockchain transactions, human-building interaction through a virtual assistant, and LLM-based autonomous building facilities automation. Furthermore, the physical infrastructure layer comprises the tangible components of the system, including the physical infrastructure, building systems and facilities, IoT edge devices, and environmental sensors, which are mainly responsible for data collection and operation of the physical space. In addition, the Data Transmission and Visualization Layer handles the processing and visualizing of the data collected from the physical layer. Its main component is the digital building twin portal, which gives the user real-time visualization of physical space conditions, including indoor environment, occupancy, and reservation status. The following sections will discuss each of these components in further detail."}, {"title": "Decentralized governance platform", "content": "The primary component of the proposed DAB-CPS framework is the decentralized governance platform, which serves as the central decision-making and operational hub of the physical space. Fig. 5 illustrates the architecture framework of the platform's framework, including its DAO-based governance mechanism and main functionality. The main objective of this decentralized governance platform is to facilitate transparent, secure, and decentralized governance processes among key stakeholders to collectively manage the physical space and building infrastructure, including facilities management tasks such as building facilities automation logic, operation, and maintenance issues as well as financial related matter such as income, budget allocations, expense for the physical space with DAO treasury and blockchain-based transactions, ultimately enabling a self-sustaining, nonprofit-seeking operation. Depending on the ownership structure of the physical space (public or private), DAO members can be comprised of various stakeholders, including building owners, facility managers, maintenance team, or broader occupant demographics who will be responsible for data-driven and collective governance of the DAO physical space by collectively propose and vote on different matters such as funding allocation, space operational settings, maintenance schedules, etc.\nVoting mechanisms are essential to the operation of the decentralized governance platform. Upon the initial deployment of the DAO on the blockchain network, a predetermined quantity of governance tokens is minted and allocated to members based on their specific roles and responsibilities within the organization. Key members will receive a larger allocation of governance tokens, which grants them more voting power and governance rights compared to regular members. The governance tokens used in this study are based on the ERC-20 standard [46] as they provide token fungibility and transferability among DAO members, which facilitate the fractionalized ownership of the DAO system and the delegation of voting power. The platform will implement a token-based quorum voting mechanism [47], where the voting power will be proportionate to the number of tokens held by the DAO members. The DAO's governance process encompasses several key stages, including proposal submission, vote casting, proposal queuing, and execution. These procedures are governed by predefined conditions embedded within the DAO's smart contract, established during its initial deployment. These conditions include voter eligibility criteria, available voting options, duration of voting periods, implementation of voting delays, and quorum requirements. Upon the submission of a proposal for on-chain voting, a mandatory delay period is initiated. This interval allows voters to thoroughly examine the proposal, engage in discussions, and formulate informed decisions before casting their votes. Once the active voting period starts, eligible members can securely sign and cast their votes, with results transparently recorded on the blockchain. If a proposal achieves the required threshold, a minimum delay period is enforced before smart contract execution. This pause provides an opportunity for members to contest decisions or retract support if necessary, ensuring thoughtful consideration and mitigating hasty actions. Following this delay, the smart contract autonomously triggers the corresponding actions and updates the blockchain ledger. These actions may encompass fund transfers, contract modifications, or the initiation of any governance activities such as access control, incentivization, and more."}, {"title": "Space reservation portal", "content": "The Space Reservation Portal functions as a vital component of the decentralized autonomous building system, serving as the primary income source for the proposed DAB-CPS system. The portal provides an intuitive, web-based interface that allows users to easily navigate available time slots, make reservations, and manage their bookings. Users' booking and cancellation will be facilitated by the blockchain's smart contracts. This ensures that all transactions are immutable, traceable, and executed automatically without intermediaries. When a user makes a booking, the associated funds are automatically transferred to the DAO's treasury through smart contracts."}, {"title": "Al virtual assistant portal", "content": "The Al Virtual Assistant portal aims to facilitate the human-building interaction aspect within the proposed DAB-CPS framework. This portal aims to provide smart and personalized assistance to both the DAO members and regular users for interaction with the physical building facilities and the Dapp components such as the decentralized governance platform and space reservation portal. For regular users, the Al virtual assistant serves as an interface for interacting with the physical space. Users can communicate with the Al virtual assistant through text and voice input to control various building facilities, adjust setpoints for the specific building smart facilities, or turn systems on or off as needed. The assistant also provides real-time information on indoor environmental conditions by accessing live sensor data reading from the IoT device. Additionally, it integrates with the blockchain-based reservation system, allowing users to check room availability and book spaces directly through the Al interface. The Al virtual assistant also facilitates the governance tasks of the DAO members and administrators of the physical space. The Al virtual assistant also supports the DAO members or owners in their interactions with the blockchain. DAO members can instruct the Al virtual assistant to vote on their behalf by calling the appropriate smart contract functions for executing transactions, including voting, queuing and exacting proposals, and transfer of blockchain assets and tokens. It can also facilitate the creation and submission of new DAO proposals, thereby streamlining the governance workflow.\nCentral to the Al virtual assistant is a locally hosted, open-source LLM and its function calling capabilities, specifically the LLaMA3 model by Meta [48]. The use of local and open-source LLM is driven by several factors, including enhanced data privacy, and reduced operational costs. By keeping all interactions and data processing within the local infrastructure, the system also ensures independence from third-party entities and maintains strict control over sensitive information. The Al virtual assistant Portal workflow is illustrated in Fig. 6, which demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend components. Users interact with the system through a web-based chat interface. The submitted prompts by the user are transferred to the backend and processed by the local LLM model. Upon receiving a query, the LLMs model leverages its reasoning and function-calling capabilities to understand the user's request and activates the appropriate predefined tools for either facilities management tasks or blockchain-related operations before executing the corresponding tasks. In this study, the quantization of the LLM is performed using the Llama.cpp library [49]. Quantization is an essential operation for the reduction of the model's size and computational requirements, which is particularly important for deploying the Al virtual assistant on local hardware [50]."}, {"title": "Digital building twin", "content": "The digital building twin offers a comprehensive virtual representation of the physical structure within the proposed DAB-CPS framework. This advanced digital replica enables real-time monitoring of various building performance metrics, including energy usage, environmental data, and space availability.

There are two different digital twin visualizations available in this study (Fig. 7). The first digital twin visualization aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into the building's environmental condition and corresponding energy performance, which facilitates data-driven decisions for the physical space facilities management strategies. The real-time and historical environmental data such as humidity level, temperature, light intensity, carbon monoxide gas, and energy usage information are collected with and processed by edge devices before being transmitted to the first digital twin platform. Furthermore, the second digital twin platform focuses on the dynamic representation of the physical space's availability and reservation status."}, {"title": "LLM-based autonomous building operation.", "content": "In addition to the Al virtual assistant in the previous section, the DAB-CPS framework also leverages LLMs and function callings as an Al agent to oversee the autonomous building operation and facilities management. The proposed LLM-based autonomous building operation framework leverages the integration of IoT devices and sensors, smart building facilities such as the HVAC and lighting system, LLMs, and blockchain technologies to create decentralized and automated control of building systems (Fig. 8).\nAn array of environmental sensors and IoT Devices will be used to collect environmental data such as temperature, humidity, luminosity, carbon monoxide gas levels, as well as the energy usage information and occupancy level within the physical space. Raspberry Pi devices are used to process these data and feed them into the Al agent through REST API. In addition, the threshold parameters used for the automated smart building facilities operation (e.g., max or min temperature, humidity, etc.) will be extracted from the blockchain smart contracts, ensuring secure and transparent operations. These threshold values are the baseline comfort parameters for ensuring optimal comfort and indoor environmental quality and are defined by DAO members, who serve as administrators for the physical spaces. These thresholds are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and immutability and form the basis for the Al's decision-making process. During the operation, the LLM-based Al agent will continuously compare real-time sensor data from the physical space against these predefined thresholds on the blockchain. When the environmental data values exceed these thresholds, the Al agent utilizes its function-calling capabilities to control various building systems, including smart lighting and HVAC systems. These operations involve adjusting setpoints, activating or deactivating devices, or triggering alerts to maintain optimal building conditions.\nIn addition to the rule-based automation, the LLM-based Al agent is also designed to perform contextual decision-making, which allows for more sophisticated and dynamic system control. The proposed Al agent can interpret multiple variables simultaneously, such as the current settings of smart appliances and the occupancy levels within the building. In this study, the occupancy data will be periodically analyzed, and the Al agent will adjust the performance of building systems (e.g., HVAC performance or lighting intensity) based on occupancy level to dynamically optimize energy consumption. In addition to occupancy-based adjustments, the Al agent can also process natural language inputs from users, such as feedback or specific requests, and dynamically modify its autonomous control logic in response. This enables the system to accommodate immediate individual preferences or situational changes. The proposed Al agent provides a level of flexibility and adaptability that surpasses traditional automation systems, making the building's operational framework not only more efficient but also more responsive to dynamic environmental and user-driven changes."}, {"title": "Proof of concept: Implementation and validation of the prototype"}]}

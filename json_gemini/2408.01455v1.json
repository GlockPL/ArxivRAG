Here, we focus on developing a pragmatic ontology of belief systems, which is a complex and often controversial space. By iterating on our community-based design until mutual agreement is reached, we found that epistemological methods were best for cate- gorizing the fundamental ways beliefs differ, maximally re- specting our principles of inclusivity and brevity.

Thoughtfully incorporating the diversity of societal beliefs and values into AI is paramount to the success and benefit of AI deploy- ment, especially for applications in AI fairness (Dwork et al. 2012) and value alignment (Gabriel 2020). However, such measures of success themselves are highly subjective and diversity alignment efforts critically depend on the under- lying ontology of the identified communities; for example, the choice of nationalities that are considered during fairness testing. To further complicate things, value alignment de- pends on community context: for forum content moderation, each community implicitly subscribes to a different social contract, so toxicity differs for these communities (Goyal et al. 2022), meaning that an appropriately granular ontol- ogy of societal communities is important.\nMany AI applications implicitly use belief ontologies to capture diverse perspectives, extending beyond well-established religions. Previous works have explored faith- based classification (Chaturvedi and Chaturvedi 2023), dis- crimination in language models (Muralidhar 2021), and how models respond to prompts about different beliefs to reveal biases (Rae et al. 2021; Brown et al. 2020). However, these analyses often rely on a limited set of prompts and lack a clear, inclusive framework for representing diverse world beliefs, leaving a critical gap in understanding.\nIn an increasingly globalized world, fostering a robust un- derstanding of diverse beliefs holds immense social signif- icance (Hackett et al. 2012). This understanding promotes tolerance and reduces prejudice, breaking down harmful stereotypes within multicultural societies. Belief diversity also enriches cultural expression, evident in the arts, liter- ature, and even the output of generative AI models (Gozalo- Brizuela and Garrido-Merchan 2023). Ultimately, recogniz- ing the full spectrum of beliefs can pave the way for greater peace and harmony, leading to a more stable and secure world.\nDespite the overwhelming ambiguity of structuring belief systems, our main goal is to construct an inclusive and con- cise ontology that is ideally universally used for societal and machine learning classification. Due to the controversial, ambiguous and personal nature of beliefs, this is extremely difficult and subjective: we acknowledge that any ontology will be inherently limited in its understanding and represen- tation of belief systems and the underlying relational struc- ture is likely an oversimplification. Nevertheless, our ambi- tion is to answer the following question:\nHow do we create a pragmatic ontology of belief sys- tems, capturing diversity and ambiguity of beliefs, so as to induce a sense of belonging for all, yet be suc- cinct and concise for human consumption and use in certain AI applications?"}, {"title": "Our Contribution", "content": "From multiple iterations of community discussions, we dis- cover our initial approaches and the previous approaches to belief system ontology suffers bias mainly from the choice of categorization labels that may be controversial. To max- imize consensus between belief communities, we propose an epistemological approach for our main ontological cat- egories, also described as mid-level beliefs, allowing for a succinct yet non-controversial ontology in the midst of the exploding number of different beliefs. Specifically, in order to accomplish this, we derive three main principles for on- tology creation for belief systems that we believe can gener- alize to other contexts, such as fairness or for other protected attributes such as race."}, {"title": "Simple Hierarchy", "content": "We assessed a hierarchical structure for beliefs, rather than a mere list, fosters a sense of inclusion even for those whose specific beliefs may not be explicitly represented. Our goal is to identify a small number of mid- level belief categories that serve as umbrellas, encompass- ing the vast diversity of base-level belief systems. Ideally, each specific belief should strongly align with its assigned category, and these categories should collectively cover the majority of known beliefs. For simplicity, we suggest a sin- gle, intermediate hierarchical layer designed to capture max- imum diversity at the base level."}, {"title": "Epistemological Ontology", "content": "We find that mid-level be- liefs should critically represent a precise grouping of base- level beliefs for satisfying both brevity and inclusivity. An important principle we propose for finding inclusive belief groupings is that correlation does not imply causation: A be- lief should not be grouped via correlated attributes that are not inherent to the belief system. For example, while his- torical context is important for understanding religion, using geographical or racial labels are unnecessarily exclusive and insensitive since there is no real direct causation between the two, despite the large correlation.\nWe propose that epistemological justification - the way beliefs are validated - should form the foundation of mid- level belief groupings. This approach highlights the criti- cal differences in how beliefs are grounded, revealing their unique axiomatic origins. By focusing on the five widely ac- cepted sources of knowledge (perception, introspection, rea- son, memory, and testimony), we create a framework that ac- commodates diverse beliefs while maintaining a manageable number of categories. This has multiple benefits of inclu- sivity, which provides a rigorous yet adaptable system that minimizes the risk of excluding belief systems, and preci- sion, which helps avoid the common pitfall of misapplying justification types, which often leads to offensive or nonsen- sical language output."}, {"title": "Belief Term and Group Identification", "content": "The base beliefs themselves were identified via a set of pragmatic principles and is largely influenced by the Pew Research on the Global Religious Landscape (Hackett et al. 2012), which provides evidence on faiths that have a large sustained historical im- pact. We emphasize a belief, along with its derived value system, generally utilizes a spectrum of epistemological jus- tifications to arrive at its respective conclusions. Therefore, the connection between the identified beliefs and its episte- mological justification loosely indicates that there is a con- sensus that such beliefs mostly rely on its connected justifi- cation as the basis for a majority of its propositions."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Finally, we test our ontology's improved ability to capture belief diversity via experiments with user studies for the downstream tasks of belief term annotation and sentiment analysis for belief fairness in language mod- els. For belief term annotation, we find that participants more easily agreed on annotating to a mid-level belief as compared to base-level beliefs, as shown in the distribu- tion of inter annotator averages. Therefore, the presence of the hierarchical belief groups improves inter-rater agreement and helps disambiguate terms. For language models, we find that our mid-level epistemological layer helps with fairness testing for all religions, without direct enumeration. Specifically, we observe that in some contexts, applying sentiment analysis to our subset of mid-level beliefs can generalize to performance on an augmented set of base-level beliefs, im- plying that fairness testing on our identified subset may be sufficient to replace testing over the large pool of belief sys- tems."}, {"title": "Previous and Related Works", "content": "Classical works on belief ontologies have explored various classification factors like norms, geography, ethnicity, phi- losophy, such as phenomenology (Adams 1998). This high- lights the immense complexity and controversy of the task, with approaches ranging from Hegel's focus on spirituality (Hegel 2021) to Ward's controversial reliance on an ethno- graphical classification (Ward 1909), while others grouped religions via the characteristic beliefs or phenomena, specif- ically characteristics \"which correspond as far as possible to the essential and typical elements\" (Kristensen 2013). How- ever, these ontologies suffer from either being too vague for in-depth analysis or too specific and biased, lacking cer- tain widely represented beliefs. With increasing emphasis on diversity, ontologies must become more inclusive and less reliant on problematic distinctions; however it cannot be overly verbose for human consumption or fairness testing.\nTherefore, the postmodern era's embrace of diverse hu- man beliefs highlights the need for ontologies to become more expansive and mitigate potential biases in categoriza- tion. Haphazardly creating ontologies can lead to ones that lack depth, focusing on general classifications rather than specific world religions. For example, the one proposed in Thouki (2019) offers an inclusive framework but remains too abstract for detailed belief analysis (see 1). Other on- tologies may be overly specific or rely on potentially biased distinctions, such as the problematic East/West classification (Ling 1969), which unnecessarily links beliefs to geography.

Psychology delves into the human mind, exploring the cog- nitive and emotional processes that underpin faith, while philosophy examines the nature of belief itself and its im- plications for knowledge and reality. This complex interplay reveals how beliefs are influenced by both psychological fac- tors, such as personal experiences and social conditioning, and philosophical considerations, including the quest for meaning and the search for truth. Ren\u00e9 Descartes famously questioned the reliability of sensory perception and sought a firm foundation for knowledge (Descartes and Cress 1998). He emphasized the role of reason and clear and distinct ideas in forming beliefs, advocating for a systematic doubt of all preconceived notions. William James argued that beliefs are not merely intellectual assent, but also guide our actions and shape our experiences. He explored the role of emo- tions and personal experiences in belief formation, arguing that it is permissible to hold a belief even without sufficient evidence (James 2014). Eventually, James Frederick Ferrier established epistemology as a distinct branch of philosophy, dedicated to the systematic study of knowledge and its foun- dations (Ferrier 1854). Epistemology, which is the study of the source and justification of knowledge itself, then plays a pivotal role in unraveling the foundations of belief, whether religious or secular, and providing fundamental insights into how we acquire and justify our convictions (Steup and Neta 2005). For this reason, the study of epistemology is crucial for understanding and fairly measuring beliefs in AI models, and belief-based terms used in LLM models."}, {"title": "Challenges and Limitations", "content": "Agreeing upon a set of beliefs or religious (also known as the terms of the ontology) when considering various cultural and theological preferences is a complex task. There are a number of factors that contribute to this complexity:\n\u2022 Large Diversity: There are many different beliefs in the world, each with its own unique set of axioms and prac- tices. This diversity can make it difficult to agree on a single set of terms that can be used to describe all beliefs.\n\u2022 Interpretation Uncertainty: Even within the same belief or religion, there can be a variety of different ways that such terms can be interpreted. This is because religious texts and teachings can be interpreted in different ways, inducing uncertainty in the intrinsic meaning of identical religious concepts.\n\u2022 Cultural Context: Terms can have different meanings in different cultural contexts throughout history. For exam- ple, the term \"God\" may have a different meaning for a modern-day Christian than it does for a Hindu a century ago."}, {"title": "Benefits of Belief Ontology for AI", "content": "Despite the challenges, ontology creation for belief systems still remains a key first step to a belief-aware AI and may bring many benefits, such as cross-community understand- ing, bias mitigation and knowledge sharing. Here is a list of just some components of the AI data and modeling pipeline that could positively impacted by an inclusive ontology:\n\u2022 Term Lists: Allowlists and denylists of keywords are of- ten used as stop gap measures in efforts to curb toxicity or ensure that common words relevant to identity are cov- ered (Simonite 2021). This could include specific reli- gious terms related to identity such as 'Christian', 'Jew', 'Muslim', 'Hindu', 'Buddhist' or names of religious fol- lowers or important cultural aspects of wisdom traditions and religions.\n\u2022 Coverage Tracking: Granular information on how terms relate to conceptual information such as religious classi- fications. This is intended to help teams to generate slices of data. These slices can then be used to see where mod- els are under performing with respect to religious repre- sentation.

Like most ontologies, we gen- erally rely on a tree-based approach for easy relational visu- alization, although we considered the use of Venn diagrams, which could be used to illustrate more subtle similarities and differences between different religious terms and underly- ing belief systems; however they were deemed overly com- plicated for downstream tasks. We emphasize that although we use a graph to represent ontological connections between beliefs, relationships between beliefs are complex and onto- logical connections do not represent a simple 'is-a' relation- ship."}, {"title": "Ontology Iterations", "content": "Our initial belief ontology (see Figure 2) distinguished be- tween secular and organized religions, with consideration for philosophical overlaps. However, feedback from our in- ternal committee indicated a need for simpler, more author- itative distinctions between belief groups. Specifically, cer- tain beliefs such as Buddhism or Hinduism, include the vast range from worship of many deities, i.e. polytheism, to no deities at all, i.e. atheism. Some responded that belief sys- tems should be classified based on goals of the follower of the belief system rather than characteristics of the belief.\nUpon trying to reach a consensus on the right classifica- tion criterion, two key insights emerged:\n1. Foundational Axioms: Beliefs should be grouped based on their fundamental, belief-inducing principles, not the content of the beliefs themselves or the number of gods involved. This reflects the epistemological underpinnings of different belief systems.\n2. Correlation vs. Causation: We must avoid grouping be- liefs based on correlated but non-inherent attributes like geography, race, or historical origin. Using such labels introduces bias, potential for insensitivity, and obscures the genuine diversity within belief groups.\nTherefore, from these two observations, we suggest that ontological groupings for mid-level beliefs should be fun- damental, differentiating on the ultimate belief-inducing ax- ioms, rather than the beliefs themselves. This is governed the study of epistemology, the study of understanding the source of knowledge and beliefs. By focusing on epistemological justification, the ontology remains succinct and adaptable to diverse beliefs, while disallowing inclusion of unjustified beliefs. This has practical implications for linguistic models, as it helps avoid the common error of applying the wrong type of justification (e.g., reason instead of testimony) when generating language, thus reducing the risk of offensive out- put.\nHowever, the epistemological labels themselves for mid- level beliefs went through multiple changes with community feedback. Version 2.0 consisted of four separate pillars of epistemological authority: (1) Rationalism (2) Empiricism (3) Dharma (4) Religion (see Figure 3). This version aimed to compensate for misunderstanding and misalignment to Eastern Religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, which were poorly represented in the previous version. From our community discussions, our team also added a hierarchy to break-down the definition of system from each of the three justifications, and then, each of the religions most repre- sented. However, the labels were chosen and named rela- tively arbitrarily and many beliefs found the labels as contro- versial, such as Religion for Christianity or Dharma for Bud- dhism. Furthermore, it was unclear why only 4 mid-level nodes were chosen. That said, there was positive feedback"}, {"title": "Belief Identification", "content": "Once we decide on the mid-level beliefs, avoiding bias in base-level belief identification is a core pillar of the project; ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and credibility of ongoing research. Given our use cases in AI, our basis for belief iden- tification is then based on the following guiding principles:\n\u2022 Fundamental Epistemology: Identified beliefs should be generally fundamental and axiomatic, generally concern- ing a source of morals, ethics, or truth, and not based or inferred on other beliefs or values (i.e. political or scien- tific beliefs are generally excluded)\n\u2022 Large Sustained Historical Impact: A belief should have a large historical impact on a sizable group of people, influencing key societal outcomes, such as politics, eco- nomics, international relations. Furthermore, such im- pact should generally be sustained through an extended period of time and continue to the modern day. This is especially relevant given that our ontology is meant to be pragmatic in nature.\n\u2022 Non-Exclusivity and Uniqueness: We acknowledge that one can embrace multiple beliefs and there is epistemo- logical ambiguity within each belief identity. Each iden- tified belief should, however, carry relatively unique ax- iomatic elements that are generally agreed upon and not easily related to other identified beliefs, or a mixture of other identified beliefs.\nWe propose that any newly identified base-level belief must satisfy all three principles in order to be added to the ontology, and present a clear case of its most related epis- temological justification, as well as its historical impact and unique axioms from previously identified beliefs. Our final belief identification in our ontology is largely influenced by the Pew Research on the Global Religious Landscape (Hack- ett et al. 2012), which provides a data-driven study of beliefs that have a large sustained historical impact. Note that the research includes folk religion and demonstrates that there are 6 percent of the world that practices folk religion, espe- cially in Africa/Asia. In addition to the identified religions, we added 'Indigenous' into the ontology, which encapsu- lates folk and indigenous belief-based practices, as well as modern paganism. We also split the 'Unaffiliated' into both 'Atheism' and 'Agnosticism', which are both distinct funda- mental beliefs that should be directly mentioned due to their global prevalence."}, {"title": "User Annotation Studies", "content": "Setup. Using our ontology, we conducted a preliminary pi- lot categorization of religion related terms with annotators from an employee resource community-driven group that promotes belief-based diversity, (see (Google 2024) for an example group). The goal was to validate that the ontology is reasonable and its usefulness for inclusivity and represen- tation. The pilot conducted had 10 total volunteer partici- pants, all leads from a diversity of faith communities. We equally looked at how our expert provider annotators would categorize terms under the new ontology. We used a team of 10 provider annotators with standard privacy protocols. Our annotation provider was paid 49 USD per hour for a total of 30 hours of work. Annotators from both groups were pre- sented with 120 religion related terms in US English. The terms were sourced from existing resources, such as Wiki- data (Zou 2020). We asked participants to select a node in the ontology that best reflected the category of the term and allowed a node at any level of the ontology could be selected. Task instructions were provided to participants as summa- rized in the following table 1 Category definitions followed the ontology outlined in Figure 4. Participants provided their annotations with one row per ontological categorization. Results. In the results, we took an inter-annotator major- ity by averaging the number of annotators having selected the category over the total number of participants. The inter-annotator averages tended to be higher in the upper nodes of the ontology than in applying more granular nodes. In other words, participants more easily attributed a term to being re- lated to a mid-level belief in some way rather than a more specific religious classification, as shown in the distribution of inter annotator averages in Figures 5 and 6."}, {"title": "Sentiment Analysis for Large Language Models", "content": "We show that our ontology can help with inclusive AI fair- ness testing, which can become computationally and statis- tically intensive given the large number of belief systems, as running tests and maintaining good performance on all beliefs can become difficult. We consider the setup of test- ing belief-based fairness via prompting sentiment analysis that was used for understanding the few-shot learning ca- pabilities of GPT (Brown et al. 2020) and was extended for other language models (Rae et al. 2021). Previously, the prompts are of the form 'Belief practitioners are', which are quite limited in its testing scope. Instead, we add prompts that are more inherent to testing deeper un- derstanding of the values of each belief. We use some inter- view questions for belief-based understanding that are foun- dational to one's belief system (Chan 2024).\nWe prompt 340B-PaLM model (Chowdhery et al. 2022) using our crafted prompts and then apply a sentiment analy- sis via Senti WordNet (Baccianella et al. 2010), where each word sentiment varied from -1 to 1, where a positive score dictated a positive sentiment. We took the average sentiment of the sentence, ignoring prepositions and verbs, as our final sentiment score. We report the sentiment analysis results be- low for our ontology, as well as additional belief terms that were used for annotations."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "We provide a diverse yet succinct belief-systems ontology based on epistemological justification. This ontology can benefit AI applications by providing a structured represen- tation of complex belief concepts. This ontology is a first step towards generating community-based contextual infor- mation on complex terms and culturally sensitive topics that reflect people and remains respectful of their identities. As such, we have contributed to ensuring that opportunities for participants of faith are available as part of the data anno- tation process. We believe that this work will continue to expand AI with a more nuanced understanding of belief sys- tems, encapsulating many wisdom, religious and faith re- lated terms.\nFuture works include encapsulating community principles in a framework that can be replicated for further community- based ontological development of faith related concepts. We also aim to extend the current ontology to capture important aspects of belief such as traditions, rites, places of worship or practice, historical events, moving beyond a classification"}]}

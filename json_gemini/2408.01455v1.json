Thoughtfullyincorporating the diversity of societal beliefs and values intoAI is paramount to the success and benefit of AI deploy-ment, especially for applications in AI fairness (Dwork et al.2012) and value alignment (Gabriel 2020). However, suchmeasures of success themselves are highly subjective anddiversity alignment efforts critically depend on the under-lying ontology of the identified communities; for example,the choice of nationalities that are considered during fairnesstesting. To further complicate things, value alignment de-pends on community context: for forum content moderation,each community implicitly subscribes to a different socialcontract, so toxicity differs for these communities (Goyalet al. 2022), meaning that an appropriately granular ontol-ogy of societal communities is important.\nMany AI applications implicitly use belief ontologiesto capture diverse perspectives, extending beyond well-established religions. Previous works have explored faith-based classification (Chaturvedi and Chaturvedi 2023), dis-crimination in language models (Muralidhar 2021), and howmodels respond to prompts about different beliefs to revealbiases (Rae et al. 2021; Brown et al. 2020). However, theseanalyses often rely on a limited set of prompts and lack a\nclear, inclusive framework for representing diverse worldbeliefs, leaving a critical gap in understanding.\nIn an increasingly globalized world, fostering a robust un-derstanding of diverse beliefs holds immense social signif-icance (Hackett et al. 2012). This understanding promotes tolerance and reduces prejudice, breaking down harmfulstereotypes within multicultural societies. Belief diversityalso enriches cultural expression, evident in the arts, liter-ature, and even the output of generative AI models (Gozalo-Brizuela and Garrido-Merchan 2023). Ultimately, recogniz-ing the full spectrum of beliefs can pave the way for greaterpeace and harmony, leading to a more stable and secureworld.\nDespite the overwhelming ambiguity of structuring beliefsystems, our main goal is to construct an inclusive and concise ontology that is ideally universally used for societal andmachine learning classification. Due to the controversial,ambiguous and personal nature of beliefs, this is extremelydifficult and subjective: we acknowledge that any ontologywill be inherently limited in its understanding and represen-tation of belief systems and the underlying relational struc-ture is likely an oversimplification. Nevertheless, our ambi-tion is to answer the following question:\nHow do we create a pragmatic ontology of belief sys-tems, capturing diversity and ambiguity of beliefs, soas to induce a sense of belonging for all, yet be suc-cinct and concise for human consumption and use incertain AI applications?"}, {"title": "Our Contribution", "content": "From multiple iterations of community discussions, we dis-cover our initial approaches and the previous approaches tobelief system ontology suffers bias mainly from the choiceof categorization labels that may be controversial. To max-imize consensus between belief communities, we proposean epistemological approach for our main ontological cat-egories, also described as mid-level beliefs, allowing fora succinct yet non-controversial ontology in the midst of theexploding number of different beliefs. Specifically, in orderto accomplish this, we derive three main principles for on-tology creation for belief systems that we believe can gener-alize to other contexts, such as fairness or for other protectedattributes such as race."}, {"title": "Simple Hierarchy", "content": "We assessed a hierarchical structurefor beliefs, rather than a mere list, fosters a sense of inclusioneven for those whose specific beliefs may not be explicitlyrepresented. Our goal is to identify a small number of mid-level belief categories that serve as umbrellas, encompass-ing the vast diversity of base-level belief systems. Ideally,each specific belief should strongly align with its assignedcategory, and these categories should collectively cover themajority of known beliefs. For simplicity, we suggest a sin-gle, intermediate hierarchical layer designed to capture max-imum diversity at the base level."}, {"title": "Epistemological Ontology", "content": "We find that mid-level be-liefs should critically represent a precise grouping of base-level beliefs for satisfying both brevity and inclusivity. Animportant principle we propose for finding inclusive beliefgroupings is that correlation does not imply causation: A be-lief should not be grouped via correlated attributes that arenot inherent to the belief system. For example, while his-torical context is important for understanding religion, usinggeographical or racial labels are unnecessarily exclusive andinsensitive since there is no real direct causation between thetwo, despite the large correlation.\nWe propose that epistemological justification\\u2014the waybeliefs are validated\\u2014should form the foundation of mid-level belief groupings. This approach highlights the criti-cal differences in how beliefs are grounded, revealing theirunique axiomatic origins. By focusing on the five widely ac-cepted sources of knowledge (perception, introspection, rea-son, memory, and testimony), we create a framework that ac-commodates diverse beliefs while maintaining a manageablenumber of categories. This has multiple benefits of inclu-sivity, which provides a rigorous yet adaptable system thatminimizes the risk of excluding belief systems, and preci-sion, which helps avoid the common pitfall of misapplyingjustification types, which often leads to offensive or nonsen-sical language output."}, {"title": "Belief Term and Group Identification", "content": "The base beliefs themselves were identified via a set of pragmatic principlesand is largely influenced by the Pew Research on the GlobalReligious Landscape (Hackett et al. 2012), which providesevidence on faiths that have a large sustained historical im-pact. We emphasize a belief, along with its derived valuesystem, generally utilizes a spectrum of epistemological jus-tifications to arrive at its respective conclusions. Therefore,the connection between the identified beliefs and its episte-mological justification loosely indicates that there is a con-sensus that such beliefs mostly rely on its connected justifi-cation as the basis for a majority of its propositions."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Finally, we test our ontology's improvedability to capture belief diversity via experiments with userstudies for the downstream tasks of belief term annotationand sentiment analysis for belief fairness in language mod-els. For belief term annotation, we find that participantsmore easily agreed on annotating to a mid-level beliefas compared to base-level beliefs, as shown in the distribu-tion of inter annotator averages. Therefore, the presence ofthe hierarchical belief groups improves inter-rater agreementand helps disambiguate terms. For language models, we findthat our mid-level epistemological layer helps with fairnesstesting for all religions, without direct enumeration. Specifically, we observe that in some contexts, applying sentimentanalysis to our subset of mid-level beliefs can generalize toperformance on an augmented set of base-level beliefs, implying that fairness testing on our identified subset may besufficient to replace testing over the large pool of belief sys-tems."}, {"title": "Previous and Related Works", "content": "Classical works on belief ontologies have explored variousclassification factors like norms, geography, ethnicity, phi-losophy, such as phenomenology (Adams 1998). This high-lights the immense complexity and controversy of the task,with approaches ranging from Hegel's focus on spirituality(Hegel 2021) to Ward's controversial reliance on an ethno-graphical classification (Ward 1909), while others groupedreligions via the characteristic beliefs or phenomena, specif-ically characteristics \"which correspond as far as possible tothe essential and typical elements\" (Kristensen 2013). How-ever, these ontologies suffer from either being too vague forin-depth analysis or too specific and biased, lacking cer-tain widely represented beliefs. With increasing emphasison diversity, ontologies must become more inclusive andless reliant on problematic distinctions; however it cannot beoverly verbose for human consumption or fairness testing.\nTherefore, the postmodern era's embrace of diverse hu-man beliefs highlights the need for ontologies to becomemore expansive and mitigate potential biases in categoriza-tion. Haphazardly creating ontologies can lead to ones thatlack depth, focusing on general classifications rather thanspecific world religions. For example, the one proposed inThouki (2019) offers an inclusive framework but remainstoo abstract for detailed belief analysis (see 1). Other on-tologies may be overly specific or rely on potentially biaseddistinctions, such as the problematic East/West classification(Ling 1969), which unnecessarily links beliefs to geography.Due to the inherent complexities and potential for con-troversy, the challenging task of crafting a belief ontologyis often sidestepped in favor of simply generating rankedlists of world religions. These lists typically prioritize pop-ulation size or geographical reach. For instance, Wikipedia(2024) focuses solely on religions ranked by number of fol-lowers, excluding Judaism despite its profound historicalsignificance and influence on other faiths. We strongly ad-vise against using such ranked belief lists for downstreamtasks, as they imply superiority, introduce biases, and riskbecoming unmanageable as the diversity of recognized be-liefs grows.\nGiven these complexities, there is likely no single set ofbelief terms that are universally agreed upon. However, thereare a number of efforts underway to develop sets of religiousterms that can be used to facilitate communication and un-derstanding between people of different geographic areas,across different languages, religions, and cultures. One ex-ample of such an effort is the creation of an interfaith glos-sary that captures the subtle semantics of faith-based terms.The pluralism project via Harvard University, produced anInterfaith glossary of religious terms, and World Councilof Churches produced a glossary with over 1,000 religiousterms from a variety of religious traditions (Project 2024).Another example of such an effort is the Common Word Ini-tiative, which has developed a set of shared religious termsand principles that are common to Islam, Christianity, andJudaism (Haddad and Smith 2009). These principles are in-tended to provide a foundation for interfaith dialogue andcooperation.\nBelief systems are not alone in facing ontological chal-lenges due to human diversity. Similar issues arise whendefining AI frameworks (Hawley 2019), encapsulating AItrust considerations (Knowles, Richards, and Kroeger 2022),ordesigning fairness metrics (Franklin et al. 2022). Knowl-edge graphs, used across industries to classify information,provide another parallel. For instance, the Intelligence TaskOntology (ITO) offers a vast Al resource (Blagec et al.2022). However, algorithmically-driven knowledge graphsoften lack human guidance, making them less suited for hu-man use due to their overwhelming scale (Pujara et al. 2013;Chen, Jia, and Xiang 2020)."}, {"title": "Epistemology and Beliefs", "content": "Throughout history, the realms of psychology and philoso-phy have intertwined with human worldviews and beliefs,shaping our understanding of their origins and influence.Psychology delves into the human mind, exploring the cog-nitive and emotional processes that underpin faith, whilephilosophy examines the nature of belief itself and its im-plications for knowledge and reality. This complex interplayreveals how beliefs are influenced by both psychological fac-tors, such as personal experiences and social conditioning,and philosophical considerations, including the quest formeaning and the search for truth. Ren\\u00e9 Descartes famouslyquestioned the reliability of sensory perception and sought afirm foundation for knowledge (Descartes and Cress 1998).He emphasized the role of reason and clear and distinct ideasin forming beliefs, advocating for a systematic doubt of allpreconceived notions. William James argued that beliefs arenot merely intellectual assent, but also guide our actionsand shape our experiences. He explored the role of emo-tions and personal experiences in belief formation, arguingthat it is permissible to hold a belief even without sufficientevidence (James 2014). Eventually, James Frederick Ferrierestablished epistemology as a distinct branch of philosophy,dedicated to the systematic study of knowledge and its foun-dations (Ferrier 1854). Epistemology, which is the study ofthe source and justification of knowledge itself, then plays apivotal role in unraveling the foundations of belief, whetherreligious or secular, and providing fundamental insights intohow we acquire and justify our convictions (Steup and Neta2005). For this reason, the study of epistemology is crucialfor understanding and fairly measuring beliefs in AI models,and belief-based terms used in LLM models."}, {"title": "Challenges and Limitations", "content": "Agreeing upon a set of beliefs or religious (also known asthe terms of the ontology) when considering various culturaland theological preferences is a complex task. There are anumber of factors that contribute to this complexity:\n\\u2022 Large Diversity: There are many different beliefs in theworld, each with its own unique set of axioms and prac-tices. This diversity can make it difficult to agree on asingle set of terms that can be used to describe all beliefs.\n\\u2022 Interpretation Uncertainty: Even within the same beliefor religion, there can be a variety of different ways thatsuch terms can be interpreted.

For exam-ple, the term \"God\" may have a different meaning for amodern-day Christian than it does for a Hindu a centuryago."}, {"title": "Benefits of Belief Ontology for AI", "content": "Despite the challenges, ontology creation for belief systemstill remains a key first step to a belief-aware AI and maybring many benefits, such as cross-community understand-ing, bias mitigation and knowledge sharing. Here is a list ofjust some components of the AI data and modeling pipelinethat could positively impacted by an inclusive ontology:\n\\u2022 Term Lists: Allowlists and denylists of keywords are of-ten used as stop gap measures in efforts to curb toxicityor ensure that common words relevant to identity are cov-ered (Simonite 2021). This could include specific reli-gious terms related to identity such as 'Christian', 'Jew','Muslim', 'Hindu', 'Buddhist' or names of religious fol-lowers or important cultural aspects of wisdom traditionsand religions.\n\\u2022 Coverage Tracking: Granular information on how termsrelate to conceptual information such as religious classi-fications. This is intended to help teams to generate slicesof data. These slices can then be used to see where mod-els are under performing with respect to religious repre-sentation. For example, understanding how video titlescontaining the word 'Muslim' perform vs other termslike \"Christian\" or \"Folk Religion\".\n\\u2022 Counterfactuals: Granular information to measurewhether the presence of a \"sensitive characteristic\"(e.g., a word describing a social group), presented asa counterfactual, can lead to different performanceor predictions in an ML system that are stereotypical oroffensive, similar to the close enough-possible-worldsapproach inspired by Lewis (Lewis 1973) and Stalnaker(Stalnaker 1968).\n\\u2022 Hallucinations: Unintended text produced by languagegenerating models can lead to misrepresentation of im-portant aspects of traditions or religions. This degradesthe system performance and fails to meet user expecta-tions in many real-world scenarios (et al. 1968) with re-spect to religious representation. There should be an un-derstanding of how religions are expressed or manifestedsafely by LLMs.\n\\u2022 Helpfulness/Harmlessness Alignment: In addition toavoiding harmful stereotypes of belief systems or reli-gions, text responses should also be aligned to the coretenets of a belief system. Helpfulness and harmlessnessare in tension, as excessive focus on avoiding harm canlead to 'safe' responses that is unhelpful for improvedmutual understanding (Bai et al. 2022). A good ontologydesign provides the much needed structure that facilitiesthe development of helpfulness metrics to begin tacklingbelief plurality alignment."}, {"title": "Ontology Design and Methodology", "content": "We describe our methodology of ontology creation withmultiple iterations of community feedback that ultimatelyresulted in an ontology that is fundamentally structured byepistemological justification. Like most ontologies, we gen-erally rely on a tree-based approach for easy relational visu-alization, although we considered the use of Venn diagrams,which could be used to illustrate more subtle similarities anddifferences between different religious terms and underly-ing belief systems; however they were deemed overly com-plicated for downstream tasks. We emphasize that althoughwe use a graph to represent ontological connections betweenbeliefs, relationships between beliefs are complex and onto-logical connections do not represent a simple 'is-a' relation-ship."}, {"title": "Ontology Iterations", "content": "Our initial belief ontology (see Figure 2) distinguished be-tween secular and organized religions, with considerationfor philosophical overlaps. However, feedback from our in-ternal committee indicated a need for simpler, more author-itative distinctions between belief groups. Specifically, cer-tain beliefs such as Buddhism or Hinduism, include the vastrange from worship of many deities, i.e. polytheism, to nodeities at all, i.e. atheism. Some responded that belief sys-tems should be classified based on goals of the follower ofthe belief system rather than characteristics of the belief.\nUpon trying to reach a consensus on the right classifica-tion criterion, two key insights emerged:\n1. Foundational Axioms: Beliefs should be grouped basedon their fundamental, belief-inducing principles, not thecontent of the beliefs themselves or the number of godsinvolved. This reflects the epistemological underpinnings of different belief systems.\n2. Correlation vs. Causation: We must avoid grouping be-liefs based on correlated but non-inherent attributes likegeography, race, or historical origin. Using such labelsintroduces bias, potential for insensitivity, and obscuresthe genuine diversity within belief groups.\nTherefore, from these two observations, we suggest thatontological groupings for mid-level beliefs should be fun-damental, differentiating on the ultimate belief-inducing ax-ioms, rather than the beliefs themselves. This is governed thestudy of epistemology, the study of understanding the sourceof knowledge and beliefs. By focusing on epistemologicaljustification, the ontology remains succinct and adaptableto diverse beliefs, while disallowing inclusion of unjustifiedbeliefs. This has practical implications for linguistic models,as it helps avoid the common error of applying the wrongtype of justification (e.g., reason instead of testimony) whengenerating language, thus reducing the risk of offensive out-put.\nHowever, the epistemological labels themselves for mid-level beliefs went through multiple changes with communityfeedback. Version 2.0 consisted of four separate pillars ofepistemological authority: (1) Rationalism (2) Empiricism(3) Dharma (4) Religion (see Figure 3). This version aimedto compensate for misunderstanding and misalignment toEastern Religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, whichwere poorly represented in the previous version. From ourcommunity discussions, our team also added a hierarchy tobreak-down the definition of system from each of the threejustifications, and then, each of the religions most repre-sented. However, the labels were chosen and named rela-tively arbitrarily and many beliefs found the labels as contro-versial, such as Religion for Christianity or Dharma for Bud-dhism. Furthermore, it was unclear why only 4 mid-levelnodes were chosen. That said, there was positive feedbackfor using epistemological justification as mid-level nodes.The number of graph hierarchies and splits also was animportant topic of discussion at this point. While our firstontology attempt had multiple layers, we also considered theother extreme: a simple list of beliefs. However, another coreprinciple we gathered is that a hierarchical structure, as op-posed to a simple list of different beliefs, helps to induce asense of belonging for all, even if their belief is not directlyincluded. For simplicity and ease of human consumption,we decided to aim for 1 layer of hierarchy or split that cap-tures the most fundamental characterizations of world beliefsystems.\nIn Version 2.1 changes were made to the pillars of epis-temological authority: (1) human reason (2) perception (3)testimony, and additional sub categories were added for be-lief groups that required specific delineation. However, afteradditional trial-testing of sub categories, most user-groupsfound the term \\u201cperception\\u201d to be non-substantive. Version2.2 made additional changes to the language, and changeswere made to the placement of Hindu-leaning terminol-ogy. This was considered an improvement by the Hinduuser-group, but unfamiliar/confusing language to some Bud-dhists. Version 2.3 was aimed at compensating for confu-sion and misunderstanding. The term \\u201cDharma\\u201d was addedto epistemological authority of Discernment, and the Hindusection was simplified. The Buddhist system was also seg-mented into its own sub-section, to more clearly delineatebetween Hinduism and Buddhist belief systems. In Ver-sion 2.4 additional feedback from other groups suggestedDharma be removed to simplify the chart; all parties agreed.Simplification was also made in Hindu and Hindu-relatedbeliefs.\nTo standardize the naming of mid-level beliefs, we recog-nize that there are 5 widely accepted sources of epistemolog-ical justification: perception, introspection, reason, memoryand testimony. We use standard naming conventions givenby the philosophical literature that spans centuries (Steupand Neta 2020). Since reason and memory are used in allbeliefs to derive inferred propositions from axiomatic state-ments, they are excluded from the main justification meth-ods. Therefore, we use the three remaining epistemologicaljustifications: perception, introspection, testimony. Further-more, note that most religions that are introspective requireperception and most religions that have authoritative textshave an introspective component. The reason why Hinduismis classified under Introspection, for example, is because thetexts often allow for personal interpretation and defer the fi-nal assertion of beliefs back to the individual.\nAfter all of the above iterations, the final version, includedthree separate pillars of epistemological authority: (1) Per-ception (2) Introspection (3) Testimony (see Fig 4). Each pil-lar was then given the minimum number of represented be-liefs that correspond. Using our core justification categories,we can loosely group beliefs based on their most relatedepistemological justification; however, we emphasize a be-lief, along with its derived value system, generally utilizes aspectrum of epistemological justifications to arrive at its re-spective conclusions. Therefore, the connection between theidentified beliefs and its epistemological justification simplyindicates that there is a general consensus that such beliefsheavily rely on its connected justification as the basis for amajority of its propositions."}, {"title": "Belief Identification", "content": "Once we decide on the mid-level beliefs, avoiding bias inbase-level belief identification is a core pillar of the project;ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and credibility of ongoingresearch. Given our use cases in AI, our basis for belief iden-tification is then based on the following guiding principles:\n\\u2022 Fundamental Epistemology: Identified beliefs should begenerally fundamental and axiomatic, generally concern-ing a source of morals, ethics, or truth, and not based orinferred on other beliefs or values (i.e. political or scien-tific beliefs are generally excluded)\n\\u2022 Large Sustained Historical Impact: A belief should havea large historical impact on a sizable group of people,influencing key societal outcomes, such as politics, eco-nomics, international relations. Furthermore, such im-pact should generally be sustained through an extendedperiod of time and continue to the modern day. This isespecially relevant given that our ontology is meant to bepragmatic in nature.\n\\u2022 Non-Exclusivity and Uniqueness: We acknowledge thatone can embrace multiple beliefs and there is epistemo-logical ambiguity within each belief identity. Each iden-tified belief should, however, carry relatively unique ax-iomatic elements that are generally agreed upon and noteasily related to other identified beliefs, or a mixture ofother identified beliefs.\nWe propose that any newly identified base-level beliefmust satisfy all three principles in order to be added to theontology, and present a clear case of its most related epis-temological justification, as well as its historical impact andunique axioms from previously identified beliefs. Our finalbelief identification in our ontology is largely influenced bythe Pew Research on the Global Religious Landscape (Hack-ett et al. 2012), which provides a data-driven study of beliefsthat have a large sustained historical impact. Note that theresearch includes folk religion and demonstrates that thereare 6 percent of the world that practices folk religion, espe-cially in Africa/Asia. In addition to the identified religions,we added 'Indigenous' into the ontology, which encapsu-lates folk and indigenous belief-based practices, as well asmodern paganism. We also split the 'Unaffiliated' into both'Atheism' and 'Agnosticism', which are both distinct funda-mental beliefs that should be directly mentioned due to theirglobal prevalence."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Using our ontology, we conducted a preliminary pi-lot categorization of religion related terms with annotatorsfrom an employee resource community-driven group thatpromotes belief-based diversity, (see (Google 2024) for anexample group).

The pilot conducted had 10 total volunteer partici-pants, all leads from a diversity of faith communities. Weequally looked at how our expert provider annotators wouldcategorize terms under the new ontology. We used a team of10 provider annotators with standard privacy protocols. Ourannotation provider was paid 49 USD per hour for a total of30 hours of work. Annotators from both groups were pre-sented with 120 religion related terms in US English. Theterms were sourced from existing resources, such as Wiki-data (Zou 2020). We asked participants to select a node inthe ontology that best reflected the category of the term andallowed a node at any level of the ontology could be selected.\nIn the results, we took an inter-annotator major-ity by averaging the number of annotators having selectedthe category over the total number of participants. The inter-annotator averages tended to be higher in the upper nodes ofthe ontology than in applying more granular nodes. In otherwords, participants more easily attributed a term to being re-lated to a mid-level belief in some way rather than a morespecific religious classification."}, {"title": "Sentiment Analysis for Large Language Models", "content": "We show that our ontology can help with inclusive AI fair-ness testing, which can become computationally and statis-tically intensive given the large number of belief systems,as running tests and maintaining good performance on allbeliefs can become difficult. We consider the setup of test-ing belief-based fairness via prompting sentiment analysisthat was used for understanding the few-shot learning ca-pabilities of GPT (Brown et al. 2020) and was extendedfor other language models (Rae et al. 2021). Previously,the prompts are of the form 'Belief practitionersare', which are quite limited in its testing scope. Instead,we add prompts that are more inherent to testing deeper un-derstanding of the values of each belief. We use some inter-view questions for belief-based understanding that are foun-dational to one's belief system (Chan 2024).\nWe prompt 340B-PaLM model (Chowdhery et al. 2022)using our crafted prompts and then apply a sentiment analy-sis via Senti WordNet (Baccianella et al. 2010), where eachword sentiment varied from -1 to 1, where a positive scoredictated a positive sentiment. We took the average sentimentof the sentence, ignoring prepositions and verbs, as our finalsentiment score. We report the sentiment analysis results be-low for our ontology, as well as additional belief terms thatwere used for annotations.\nFrom the results in Table 3, we observe certain trendsin the results seem to indicate that our epistemological on-tology helps with fairness for all religions, without directenumeration. Firstly, for prompt 1 and 3, sentiment analysisreveals that Agnosticism and Atheism tends to receive thelowest sentiment scores, which is also the case for the Per-ception belief. In fact, it appears that outliers in sentimentappears correlated, such as for prompt 4, Introspection has alarge high score, which is also reflected in its low-level be-liefs, such as Buddhism, Indigenous, and Tenrikyo. Finally,we see that generally for all prompts, testimony-related re-ligions, such as sects of Christianity (Anabaptist, Catholic)and sects of Islam (Sufi, Rohingya) have correlated perfor-mance with the Testimony belief.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In today's technology-driven society, there is an increasing emphasis on enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals. Indoor navigation poses unique challenges due to confined spaces, dynamic obstacles, and the need for precise and real-time object detection. While various object detection algorithms\u2014such as YOLO [2, 8], SSD [2, 3], Faster R-CNN [7], and Mask R-CNN [7]-have been extensively studied in general computer vision contexts, their specific application to assistive indoor navigation remains underexplored.\nRecent studies have demonstrated the potential of object detection models in improving accessibility technologies. For example, Tinier-YOLO [11] and MobileNet-SSD [3] have shown promise in balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, making them viable candidates for resource-constrained environments. Similarly, research on assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals [13, 14] highlights the need for precise object detection in indoor settings to ensure safe and efficient navigation. However, these studies often lack a comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance under the unique conditions of indoor environments, such as cluttered spaces and varying lighting conditions.\nThis research aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating real-time object detection algorithms\u2014YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN\u2014on key parameters relevant to indoor navigation for visually impaired users. By focusing on the trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and adaptability, this study seeks to provide actionable insights for developing inclusive navigation systems that cater to the specific needs of this demographic."}, {"title": "II. DATASET", "content": "The Indoor Objects Detection dataset was created with the aim of assisting persons with visual impairments in their day-to-day life. This dataset supports the 'Object Detection for Blind People' project under the AI Builders 2022 initiative.

RELATED WORK", "content": "Object detection is a cornerstone of computer vision, and its applications have evolved significantly in recent years. YOLO, introduced as a real-time object detection model, revolutionized the field by achieving high detection speeds without compromising accuracy [2, 8]. Subsequent iterations, such as Tinier-YOLO, have optimized the model for constrained environments [11]. Similarly, SSD leverages predefined bounding boxes to balance speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for dynamic settings [3].\nFaster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, while more computationally intensive, offer higher accuracy levels and detailed object segmentation, respectively. Studies like [6, 7] underscore their suitability for tasks requiring precision, but their applicability to real-time scenarios remains limited by their processing demands. Recent work on indoor navigation systems for visually impaired individuals [13, 14] highlights the critical role of object detection in addressing challenges such as identifying small objects and navigating crowded spaces. However, these studies often focus on a single algorithm or lack a comparative analysis across multiple models.\nDespite these advancements, existing research rarely explores the integration of these algorithms in assistive technologies tailored to indoor navigation. This gap is particularly pronounced in studies addressing real-time requirements and confined environments. Our work builds on these findings by conducting a comparative analysis of four prominent object detection models, emphasizing their performance in indoor scenarios and their implications for assistive navigation systems.\nThe reviewed literature underscores significant progress in object detection and its applications. However, the unique challenges of indoor navigation such as cluttered environments, dynamic obstacles, and the need for real-time responses necessitate further investigation. By evaluating YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN under these specific conditions, this research addresses the limitations identified in prior studies and provides a robust framework for selecting algorithms that balance accuracy, speed, and adaptability."}, {"title": "IV. ALGORITHMS", "content": "YOLO, standing for You Only Look Once, revolutionizes real-time object detection by employing a grid-based approach. The input image is split into an SxS grid, where every grid cell is tasked with directly forecasting bounding boxes and class probabilities. This innovative strategy eliminates the need for a multi-step process, enabling YOLO to achieve high speed and efficiency. The algorithm's single-pass detection system contributes to its suitability for real-time applications, making it a favorite choice in various domains [2], [8].\nWhile the explanation used a single input image for simplicity, YOLO is commonly used in a batch processing mode. Instead of processing images one by one, YOLO can efficiently process multiple frames simultaneously. This parallel processing allows for real-time detection in video streams by handling multiple frames concurrently [2], [8].\nSSD, or Single Shot MultiBox Detector, is an object detection technique optimized for a trade-off between accuracy and speed. It operates by employing a predefined set of boxes with various aspect ratios at each cell of the feature map. Simultaneously, it predicts both bounding box offsets and class scores.\nLet's see the working of SSD in detail:\n\u2022 Feature Extraction: The input image is fed into a base Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), often based on architectures like VGG16. This CNN\nextracts feature maps that represent the hierarchical properties of the input image [3], [7].\n\u2022 Default Box Assignment: At each position in the feature maps, default boxes of different aspect ratios are assigned. The SSD model then makes predictions for each of these default boxes, allowing it to handle objects of different shapes and sizes [3], [7].\n\u2022 Prediction: For each default box, the SSD model simultaneously predicts the bounding box offsets and class scores. The bounding box offsets adjust the dimensions of the default box to better fit the actual location and size of the object. The class scores represent the confidence in the appearance of different object classes within the adjusted box [3], [7].\n\u2022 Post-processing: After these predictions, a confidence threshold is applied to filter out predictions with low confidence scores. Additionally, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is employed to eliminate redundant bounding box predictions, retaining only the most accurate ones [3], [7].\nSSD's balanced accuracy and speed make it appropriate for real-time navigation systems. Its ability to handle various object scales in a single pass is advantageous, especially in dynamic environments. However, the potential decrease in accuracy for small objects might be a consideration depending on the specific requirements of a navigation application. The slight increase in computational intensity compared to YOLO should be weighed against the benefits of its versatile and efficient single-shot approach [3], [7].\nFaster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection framework which incorporates a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for generating region proposals and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.\nBoth processes are described below:\n\u2022 Region Proposal Network (RPN): Region Proposal Network (RPN) serves the function of suggesting potential object regions within an image. It accomplishes this by systematically moving a small window (anchor) across the feature map and predicting the presence or absence of an object. Concurrently, it adjusts the anchor boxes by refining them according to predicted offsets [6], [7].\n\u2022 Feature Extraction and Classification (Fast R SSD Single -CNN): Following the generation of region proposals, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to extract features from each proposed region. These features are subsequently employed for both classification and bounding box regression tasks. Notably, the CNN shares convolutional layers with the Region Proposal Network (RPN), thereby improving computational efficiency [6], [7].\nWhile Faster R-CNN excels in accuracy and precision, its slower processing speed and complexity may pose challenges in real-time navigation systems. For applications requiring instant responses and rapid object detection, such as autonomous navigation or assistive technologies for the visually impaired, speed limitations may be a critical factor [6], [7]. However, in controlled environments where high accuracy is prioritized over speed, Faster R-CNN could still find applications in navigation systems. The choice between Faster R-CNN and other algorithms depends on the explicit requirements and constraints of the navigation scenario [6], [7].\nMask R-CNN builds on the Faster R-CNN framework by adding a new branch to predict segmentation masks. This allows Mask R-CNN to not just detect objects but also precisely outline and segment each distinct instance found within the detected regions.\nLet's look at how Mask R-CNN works in more detail:\n\u2022 Region Proposal: Similar to Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN starts by generating region proposals using the Region Proposal Network (RPN) [6], [7].\n\u2022 Bounding Box Prediction: The bounding box prediction branch operates the same way as in Faster R-CNN, refining the proposed bounding boxes and classifying the objects [6], [7].\n\u2022 Segmentation Mask Prediction: The additional segmentation mask branch runs in parallel to predict pixel-level masks for each proposed bounding box. These masks provide detailed instance-level segmentation of the detected objects [6], [7].\n\u2022 Post-Processing: After making the predictions, post-processing steps like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) are applied to filter and refine the final set of bounding boxes and segmentation masks [6], [7].\nMask R-CNN's strength lies in tasks that demand detailed instance segmentation. While its accuracy in delineating objects is beneficial, the computational demands may be a consideration for real-time navigation systems, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Depending on the specific requirements of a navigation application, the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency should be carefully assessed to determine the suitability of Mask R-CNN [6], [7]."}, {"title": "V. ANALYSIS", "content": "Our analysis employs the Indoor Objects Detection dataset, focusing on evaluating each model's performance across key parameters. All four models were analyzed for our use case. We used 107 indoor images from the test dataset and calculated the speed, total time, and average time of prediction for each model. We chose this dataset because it is well-suited for indoor navigation, and we wanted our model to be limited to this dataset as it is specifically used for navigation in indoor spaces [1], [4]. The test results are informative and can be used while building a navigation system for visually impaired individuals [1], [4].\nTwo primary metrics were utilized to gauge the models' detection performance:\n1. Intersection over Union (IoU): Measures the overlap between the predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth boxes. The IoU is calculated using the formula:\n$IoU = Area\\ of\\ Overlap\\ /\\ Area\\ of\\ Union$\nThis metric is widely used to evaluate the localization accuracy of object detection models [3], [7].\n2. Mean Average Precision (mAP): Provides an aggregated measure of the model's precision across various IoU thresholds. The mAP is computed as the mean of the average precisions at different recall levels. The formula for average precision (AP) at a particular IoU threshold is:\n$AP = (TP\\ at\\ IoU)\\ /\\ (TP\\ at\\ IoU + FP\\ at\\ IoU)$\nmAP serves as a comprehensive indicator of model accuracy and is a standard benchmark in object\n\u2022 YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once): Demonstrates the highest accuracy among the models, reaching 90.1%.

SSD, with an accuracy of 79.8% and a prediction time of 0.72 seconds, also demonstrated a reasonable balance. In contrast, Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, while achieving higher precision, exhibited slower processing times, limiting their utility in real-time navigation.\nThese findings align with earlier studies emphasizing the importance of speed in assistive technologies [11, 13]. However, our study extends this understanding by demonstrating that models like YOLOv5 can effectively address the specific challenges of indoor environments, such as dynamic obstacles and varying object scales. This highlights the necessity of tailoring algorithm selection to the unique demands of the application.\nBy integrating insights from prior research with empirical evaluation, this study bridges the gap between theoretical advancements in object detection and practical applications in assistive navigation.

Spectral bias is recognized as the primary contributor to instabilities, as data-driven methods difficult to learn small-scale dynamics. In this paper, we reveal that the universal mechanism for these instabilities is not only related to spectral bias but also to distortions brought by processing spherical data using conventional convolution. These distortions lead to a rapid amplification of errors over successive long-term iterations, resulting in a significant decline in forecast accuracy. To address this issue, a universal neural operator called the Spherical Harmonic Neural Operator (SHNO) is introduced to improve long-term iterative forecasts. SHNO uses the spherical harmonic basis to mitigate distortions for spherical data and uses gated residual spectral attention (GRSA) to correct spectral bias caused by spurious correlations across different scales. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method have been validated through its application for spherical Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) and medium-range global weather forecasting. Our findings highlight the benefits and potential of SHNO to improve the accuracy of long-term prediction.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Accurate and timely weather forecasts play an important role in many aspects of human society. In the past few years, numerical weather prediction (NWP) has been the most commonly used tool for weather forecasting (L. Chen et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023), which simulates the future state of the atmosphere by solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) numerically (Bauer et al., 2015). Although NWP models can get accurate forecasts, they are often slow and need the support of high-performance computing systems (Bauer et al., 2015; Bi et al., 2023; L. Chen et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023). Moreover, errors in initial conditions, approximations of physical processes in parameterizations, and the chaos of the atmosphere introduce uncertainties to NWP (Bauer et al., 2015; L. Chen et al., 2023).\nRecently, deep learning has revolutionized the field of weather forecasts for obtaining more timely forecasts and more accurate results. For example, Rasp and Thuerey (2021) used a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) known as ResNet (He et al., 2016) to do continuous forecasts at a spatial resolution of 5.625\u00b0 \u00d7 5.625\u00b0 and obtain similar performance compared to a physical baseline at a similar resolution. FourCastNet (Pathak et al., 2022) firstly improved the data-driven global weather forecast model's resolution to 0.25\u00b0 \u00d7 0.25\u00b0, but the forecasting accuracy is slightly below the most advance NWP i.e. the operational integrated forecasting system (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Before long, data-driven weather forecasting system achieved new breakthroughs. For example, Pangu-Weather (Bi et al., 2023) produces stronger deterministic forecast results than the operational IFS on all tested weather variables against reanalysis data. Soon after, GraphCast (Lam et al., 2023) achieved better results than IFS on more variables and support better severe event prediction. In 2023, a vision transformer variant called FengWu (K. Chen et al., 2023) solves the medium-range forecast problem from a multi-modal and multi-task perspective, and achieves state-of-the-art for longer forecast lead times. Moreover, FuXi (L. Chen et al., 2023) published with the comparable performance to ECMWF ensemble mean (EM) in 15-day forecasts.\nHowever, conventional convolution and Transformer models ignore the fact that the data is on the sphere, which would introduce distortions. These distortions seriously affect the performance of iterative forecasts. To reduce the accumulation errors for longer effective forecasts, Pangu-Weather (Bi et al., 2023) trained the model on 4 different lead times and used a greedy hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy to minimize the number of iteration steps. Similarly, to optimize performance for both short and long lead times, Fuxi (L. Chen et al., 2023) used a cascade (Ho et al., 2022; Li et al., 2015) model architecture and fine-tuned the pre-trained models in specific 5-day forecast time windows. FengWu (K. Chen et al., 2023) proposed the replay buffer to store the predicted results from previous optimization iterations and used them as the current model's input, miming the intermediate input error during the auto-regressive inference stage. Although these methods have achieved good results, they still suffer distortions for the spherical data. To settle these distortions, Weyn et al. (2020) introduced cubed-sphere remapping to minimize the distortion on the cube faces and provide natural boundary conditions for padding in the convolution operations. Shen et al. (2021) analyzed the equivariance error in the spherical domain for neural networks theoretically and designed a spherical equivariant CNN to settle the distortions from projection and the ineffective translation equivariance. McCabe et al. (2023) used the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method to correct the artificial discontinuity induced by the 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), leads to significantly lower errors in long-range forecasts. But DFS still introduces spatial distortions, while spherical harmonic basis would not. Spherical harmonic basis has isotropy and rotation invariance, using Spherical Harmonic Transform (SHT) to process spherical data has natural advantages. To this end, Bonev et al. (2023) introduced Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNOs) based on SHT for learning operators on spherical geometries, demonstrating stable autoregressive, while retaining physically plausible dynamics. However, they limit themselves to equivariance in the continuous limit, and the power of nonlinear fitting in the frequency domain still needs to be explored. Moreover, they ignored the spectral bias (Chattopadhyay & Hassanzadeh, 2023; John Xu et al., 2020; McCabe et al., 2023; Rahaman et al., 2019) introduced by data-driven models.\nIn this work, we introduce the Gated Residual Spectral Attention (GRSA) to effectively leverage nonlinear information in the frequency domain, and develop a general neural operator to mitigate the accumulation of errors for long-term iterations caused by distortions and spectral bias on the sphere. Specifically, we use the SHT to extract spatial features of different scales and extend the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) to spectral domain to explore the correlation among them. Then, inspired by the Laplacian matrix in graph theory and the MEGA (Ma et al., 2023) model, we design GRSA module to utilize the spectral information and correct outliers caused by the spurious correlations across different scales. Moreover, a general neural operator named Spherical Harmonic Neural Operator (SHNO) was introduced to improve the accuracy and stability of long-term iterative forecasts. Experiments for Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) solving and medium-range global weather forecasting demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\nThe remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed MHSA, the GRSA and the SHNO. Section 3 presents the employed datasets and the experimental designs. Section 4 describes some universal factors that cause instability for data-driven models iterative forecasts through spherical SWEs solving and medium-range global weather forecasting and evaluates the proposed methods. Finally, Section 5 concludes this work."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Spectral Multi-Head Self-Attention", "content": "Self-attention is the core component of the Transformers (Alexey et al., 2021; Vaswani et al., 2017), and multiple heads are usually used to enhance the performance. The general form of MHSA in Vision Transformers can be written as follows (Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023):\n$Q^m = xW_Q^m, K^m = xW_K^m, V^m = xW_V^m$,\n$O_i^m = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{Sim(Q_i^m, K_j^m)}{\\sum_{j'=1}^N Sim(Q_i^m, K_{j'}^m)} V_j^m$,\nwhere $i \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$ refers to the i-th row, $m \\in \\{1, ..., M\\}$ refers to the m-th head, $Q^m, K^m, V^m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ are the query, key, and value matrices obtained by linearly projecting of the input N tokens $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C}$, $W_Q^m, W_K^m, W_V^m \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times d}$ are learnable projection matrices and $Sim(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ denotes the similarity function. And modern Transformers usually adopt Softmax function to measure the similarities, where\n$Sim(Q, V) = e^{\\frac{Q K^T}{\\sqrt{d}}}$, superscript $T$ means transpose.\nTo investigate the performance of the MHSA in the spectral domain, we implement a spectral multi-head self-attention (SMHSA). Since the formula of each attention head is the same, we take a single attention head as an example and its calculation formula is given as follows:\n$Q_{cv} = zW_{Qcv}, K_{cv} = zW_{Kcv}, V_{cv} = zW_{vcv}$,\n$O_{cv} = CSoftmax (\\frac{Q_{cv}K_{cv}^H}{\\sqrt{d}}) V_{cv}$,\nwhere $Q_{cv}, K_{cv}, V_{cv} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times d}$ are the query, key, and value matrices respectively, obtained by linearly projecting of the input N tokens $z = x + iy \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times C}$ with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C}$, $W_{Qcv}, W_{Kcv}, W_{vcv} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{C \\times d}$ are learnable projection matrices, $CSoftmax = Softmax(R) + iSoftmax(J)$ with $R$ represent the real part, $I$ represent the imaginary part, and $K_{cv}^H \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d \\times N}$ is conjugate transpose of $K_{cv}$."}, {"title": "2.2 Gated Residual Spectral Attention with Parametric Laplacian Matrix", "content": "Previous studies have shown, that transformer-based models may easily learn spurious correlation in the data (Enstr\u00f6m et al., 2024), and display limited robustness when the pre-training dataset is relatively small (Ghosal & Li, 2024). To address the potential spectral bias arising from spurious correlations in the SMHSA, we present a parameterized Laplacian matrix to model the interplay among different scales rather than the correlation among them.\nIn graph theory, the Laplacian matrix can be considered as the discrete analog of the Laplacian operator in multivariable calculus. It also represents the degree of difference between a vertex and its nearby vertex values. Laplacian matrix is defined as $L := D - A$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times m}$ is a weighted adjacency matrix of $X \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times n}$ and $D \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m \\times m}$ is the degree matrix with $D_{ii} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} A_{ij}$ and $D_{ij} = 0$ if $i \\neq j$. The adjacency matrix $A$ and Laplacian matrix $L$ is unknown when $X$ is incompletely sampled, so parameterization is required for machine learning applications (Li et al., 2021; Zhemin Li et al., 2023). And there are there properties to note: (1) The Laplacian matrix $L$ is positive semi-definite and the sum of each row equals zero (Zhemin Li et al., 2023); (2) The natural spectral information is usually piecewise smooth, so $L$ should be nearly smooth; (3) The adjacency matrix $A$ of a directed graph is usually a Hermitian matrix.\nIn this paper, we refer to (Zhemin Li et al., 2023), learning the adjacency matrix through an MLP and the SoftMax function. The difference is that through the multiplication of the learned lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, we assurance the adjacency matrix to a Hermitian matrix. Then the parameterized Laplacian matrix was calculated by the adjacency matrix, and used as the attention coefficient. Additionally, we implemented a moving average to the parameterized Laplacian matrix to combine information from current and previous layers using an adaptive weight, inspired by the MEGA (Ma et al., 2023). Furthermore, the gating mechanism in the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al., 2022) is equipped to control the flow of information (Lai et al., 2019). The structure of GRAS is shown in Figure 1(b), and the formula for each attention head is as follows:\n$Y_l = X_lW_{Ycv} + b_{Ycv}$,\n$X'_l = Cat(X_l, reg)$,\n$B_l = SoftMax(g(X'_l))$,\n$A_l = tril(B_l)(tril(B_l))^H$,\n$L_l = \\sigma(\\alpha_l)(A_l \\cdot 1_{n\\times n} \\odot I_n - A_l) + (1 - \\sigma(\\alpha_l))L_{l-1}$,\n$Z_l = (L_l \\cdot \\varphi(X_lW_{vcv} + b_{vcv}),$\n$Z'_l = Z_l \\odot \\varphi(X_lW_{Qcv} + b_{Qcv}),$\n$O_l = Drop(Z'_lW_{PCV} + b_{PCV}) + Y_l$,\nwhere $X_l, O_q \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times C}$ means the input and output, $l = 1... L$ is the number of network layers, $W_{YCV}, W_{VCV}, W_{PCV}, W_{QCV}, b_{Ycv}, b_{vcv}, b_{PCv}, b_{Qcv} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{C \\times d}$ are learnable projection matrices and bias, $reg$ means the registers (Darcet et al., 2024), $Cat( , )$ represents concatenate, $Drop(\\cdot)$ represents remove the registers, $g(): \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times d}$ is an MLP, which aims to capture self-similarity in $X_l$, $tril(\\cdot)$ mask the matrix with the lower triangular matrix, $H$ refers to conjugate transpose, $1_{NN}$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix whose entries are all 1s, $I_n$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix, $\\odot$ is Hadamard product, $ \\varphi$ is the smooth maximum unit (SMU) (Biswas et al., 2022), $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, $\\alpha_n$ is a learnable parameter, and the parameterized Laplacian matrix $L_n$ can measures the similarity between rows of $X_l$, $L_{l-1}$ is the parameterized Laplacian matrix from the previous layer."}, {"title": "2.3 Spherical Harmonic Neural Operator", "content": "To make the neural operators more stable and efficient for iterative forecasts, we construct Spherical Harmonic Neural Operator (SHNO) based on the SFNO (Bonev et al., 2023), ViT (Alexey et al., 2021) and the proposed GRSA. ViTs need to split the input data into several patches through a technique named patch embedding, since it can reduce the computational overhead and improve the adaptability. However, this common technique introduces discontinuity. In this paper, we remove the patch embedding, and use the total and the zonal wave number to reduce the computational complexity.\nThe architecture of SHNO is shown in the Figure 1(a). As we can see, the input is raised to the higher dimension channel space through the encoder, then the norm and the SHT is used to transform the data into spectral domain. This spectral coefficient matrix implies the degree information of the spherical harmonic functions, while the self-attention mechanism is insensitive to the degree information. To this problem, we add learnable degree encoding before the GRSA, inspired by the learnable position embeddings (Alexey et al., 2021). In the GRSA, we add registers (Darcet et al., 2024) to reduce the outliers of feature maps and improve the multi-step iteration performance. The operation in the spectral domain helps GRSA to capture global information easily. And we add the efficient local attention (ELA) (Xu & Wan, 2024) after GRAS to capture local information. Then the residual connection with a learnable parameter is used, according to (Ha & Lyu, 2022), this residual connection can help to correct the error caused by the numerical truncation of SHT and ISHT. After that, non-linear function, data norm and feed-forward network (FFN) is used. Conventional FFN integrates and maps global dependencies among different feature representations through a fully connected layer, which lacks local sensitivity (Shi et al., 2024). To this end, we choose the multi-path feed-forward network (MPFFN) (Shi et al., 2024) to integrate multi-scale dependencies. Finally, we use the decoder to transform the data back to the original dimension, and get the forecasts.\nLet the input signal is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times H \\times W}$, and the output is $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times H \\times W}$, then the formula of SHNO is:\n$z_0 = Encoder(x)$,\n$z'_l = F(Norm(z_{l-1})),$\n$z_l = ELA(F^{-1}(GRSA(z'_l + E_{degree}))) + F^{-1}(z'_l)W,$\n$z_l = FFN (Norm(GELU(z'_l))) + F^{-1}(z'_l),$\n$y = Decoder(Cat(z_l, x))$\nwhere the $E_{degree} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times H \\times W}$ is a learnable degree encoding, $l = 1 ...

As a simplification of fluid motion equation, SWEs are widely used in atmospheric dynamics, tidal motion, tsunami propagation and the simulation of Rossby waves and Kelvin waves. The precision in addressing the SWEs serves as a crucial criterion for evaluating the efficacy and robustness of numerical solution methods.\nWe choose the parameters of the Earth as the parameters of the SWEs on rotating sphere, and the initial conditions of the geopotential height and velocity fields are generated by the Gaussian random fields. The parameters for initializing the geopotential height and velocity fields are set consistent with (Bonev et al., 2023). Specifically, the average value, the standard deviation of the initial layer depth, and the average value, the standard deviation of the initial velocity are $\\varphi_{avg} = 10^3g$, $\\varphi_{std} = 120g$, and 0, $0.2 \\varphi_{avg}$, respectively.\nAfter setting the PDEs parameters and initial values, we use a classical spectral solver (Giraldo, 2001) to generate the numerical solutions with a spatial resolution of 256 \u00d7 512 and timesteps of 60 seconds. We use 128 initial conditions to simulate 240 hours and remove the first 100 hours of simulation because of the spin-up problem. Then the numerical solution is resampled to 64 \u00d7 128, and the training set is constructed with the remaining 140 hours. The solutions of the previous hour are used as the input of the model, and the solutions of the current moment are used as labels. The testing set uses 32 initial conditions, with 100 simulation hours burn-in.\nWe choose 20% of the training data as the validation data, and train the U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), FourCastNet (Pathak et al., 2022), SFNO Linear (Bonev et al., 2023), SFNO Non-Linear (Bonev et al., 2023), SHNO-SMHSA and SHNO on the remaining training data for 50 epochs, respectively. The SHNO-SMHSA model was obtained by replacing the attention mechanism of the SFNO in the spectral domain with SMHSA.

The models are trained with 100 epochs using a batch size of 80 on a single Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.

The widely used and high-performing U-Net (Ronneberger et al.", "2023)": "n$Z(\\lambda, \\varphi, p, t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\sum_{m=-n}^{n} Z_n^m (p, t) P_n^m (cos\\varphi) e^{im\\lambda},$\n$E_n^m (Z, p, t) = \\frac{1}{2} |Z_n^m (p, t)|^2$\nwhere $\\lambda$, $\\varphi$, $m$ and $n$ are longitude, latitude, zonal wavenumber, and total wavenumber, respectively. $N$ denotes truncated wavenumber, $Z_n^m$ is spectral coefficients of Z, $P_n^m$ represents associated Legendre polynomials with order $m$ and degrees $n$, $E_n^m (Z, p, t)$ is the geopotential spectra. As shown in Figure 3, in the first iteration, the spectra predicted by U-Net closely match the numerical labels, even at high frequency, which are typically considered challenging for data-driven models. After ten iterations, the low-frequency energy is underestimated, while the high-frequency energy is overestimated. With the increment of iteration steps, distortions induced by conventional convolution becomes more pronounced, leading to significant deviations in the spectra. When the iteration steps are small, FourCastNet also has a small spectral bias and good high-frequency fitting ability. However, when the iteration steps are large, data distortion causes the high-frequency energy to be falsely high and gradually affects the entire frequency. Although SHT can mitigate distortions and make the long-term iterative prediction more stable, the global nature of the spherical harmonic inevitably reduces the accuracy of localized features, which is shown as an underestimate of high-frequency energy in Figure 3. Furthermore, using non-linearities in the frequency domain is beneficial for stability.\nEffectively simulating large-scale and mesoscale dynamics, and smoothing small-scale information seems to play a significant role in keeping long-term iterative stability. However, as shown in Figure 3, the excessive loss of small-scale information in SHNO-SMHSA leads to a deterioration in forecasting large-scale and mesoscale as the number of iterations increases. This, in turn, has a detrimental impact on the overall stability of the iterations. The SHNO-SMHSA is developed by replacing the attention mechanism of the SFNO in the spectral space with SMHSA. Simply extending MHSA into the spectral domain fails to enhance performance because the absence of small-scale information leads to an escalation in forecast noise and exacerbates the Gibb phenomenon (Figure 2).

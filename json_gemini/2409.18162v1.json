Introduction", "content": "Children with autism can benefit greatly from digitally assisted language therapies thanks to augmented reality (AR). Numerous results and insights about the use of augmented reality (AR) as a teaching and pedagogical aid have been reported by educators and researchers [1]. The use of computer technology-particularly augmented reality\u2014in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) therapies has grown as a means of treating or mitigating the symptoms of the disorder. Not just for kids of a certain age or educational level, augmented reality is an entertaining form of technology that facilitates easy interaction and helps kids comprehend and retain information [2]. A neurodevelopmental disorder known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by recurring problems with social interaction and communication, as well as a limitation in interests and repetitive activities [3]. It is believed that one in every 100 youngsters worldwide are affected by ASD. Developments in autism research have been greatly enhanced by notable breakthroughs in international policy [4]. VR and Emotional Games. AR significantly improves the interactiveness of the learning process for kids with ASD [5, 6, 7]. Emerging technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are being used more frequently in research. This has made it possible to create interactive systems that are now a component of contemporary teaching techniques [40]. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects children's ability to communicate, interact socially, and engage in learning activities. Traditional educational and therapeutic approaches often struggle to meet the unique needs of children with ASD, leading researchers and practitioners to explore innovative technological solutions. Among these, Augmented Reality (AR), Large Language Models (LLMs), and effective User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) design have emerged as promising tools to enhance learning and social interaction for children with ASD. This paper systematically reviews the role of these technologies in addressing the challenges associated with ASD, focusing on their effectiveness, limitations, and potential for future applications. There is lack of research work in the field of training the children with Autism Spectrum Disorder [40]. The term \"autism spectrum disorder\" (ASD) describes a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect how people interact with their environment. It includes a variety of issues with social interaction, interpersonal connections, and confined or repetitive hobbies and habits [41]. One of the most difficult facets of contemporary education is inclusive education. Discovering cutting-edge resources that could modify the educational process to meet the needs of students with disabilities has proven to be a significant obstacle in the recent fight for educational inclusion [43]. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to produce socially realistic, perceptually rich media simulations including virtual characters that may have a distinct impact on young children's responses to content compared to traditional mediums like television [44]. Social and emotional learning (SEL) has drawn interest from all across the world in recent years. \"The process by which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions and accomplish personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions\" is the definition of support-oriented learning (SEL) [45]. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their greater availability through chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT (2023), Google's Bard (2023), and Microsoft's Bing Chat (2023) present educationalists with both new potential and problems [49]."}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": "A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Springer, and Google Scholar, using keywords such as \"Augmented Reality,\" \"Autism Spectrum Disorder,\" \"Large Language Models,\" \"UI/UX design,\" and \"Children with ASD.\" The search yielded 150 articles, of which 25 were selected for detailed analysis based on their relevance to the integration of AR, LLM, and UI/UX in interventions for children with ASD. The selected studies were evaluated based on their methodological rigor, the clarity of intervention descriptions, and the reported outcomes."}, {"title": "2.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria", "content": "\u2022 Inclusion Criteria: Studies published between 2008 and 2024, focusing on children with ASD, using AR, LLM, or UI/UX interventions, and reporting measurable outcomes related to learning, social interaction, or emotional understanding.\n\u2022 Exclusion Criteria: Studies that did not involve children with ASD, did not utilize AR, LLM, or UI/UX technologies, or lacked empirical evidence."}, {"title": "2.2 Data Extraction", "content": "Data from the selected studies were extracted and categorized into three main themes: the role of AR in enhancing social and learning outcomes, the application of LLMs in ASD interventions, and the impact of UI/UX design on the effectiveness of these technologies.

The block diagram shows the methodology used in this systematic review:"}, {"title": "3. Results and Discussion", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Augmented Reality (AR) and virtual Reality (VR) in ASD Interventions", "content": "AR has been widely studied for its potential to enhance learning and social interaction in children with ASD. The immersive and interactive nature of AR allows children to engage in scenarios that mimic real-life social interactions, which can be challenging for those with ASD. Studies by Shemy et al. (2024) [1], Wedyan et al. (2021) [2], and Berenguer et al. (2020) [3] have demonstrated that AR can significantly improve children's understanding of facial expressions, social cues, and language skills by providing a safe and controlled environment for practice.\nMoreover, AR-based applications have been shown to increase attention span and motivation in children with ASD, which are critical factors in learning [4]. However, the effectiveness of AR interventions depends heavily on the customization of content to meet individual needs, as well as the involvement of caregivers and educators in the implementation process [5]. Additionally, Bhatt et al. (2014) [5] highlight the importance of integrating AR with other therapeutic approaches to maximize its benefits.\nIn contrast to conventional emotional training carried out by therapists, this study examines the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as an intervention method for enhancing social skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\nThe goal of the study is to determine which intervention takes the least amount of time to acquire for both primary and secondary emotions. Two groups of sixty kids with level 1 ASD were created, one for VR-based training and the other for conventional therapy. The VR group had a faster acquisition time for recognizing and employing both primary and secondary emotions, but both groups showed similar acquisition times for primary emotion recognition.\nAccording to the study, VR could be a fun and useful tool for helping kids with ASD strengthen their social skills.\nThe VR intervention offers a high degree of involvement and the possibility for real-life skill application, which is in line with recent developments in the use of technology to support people with ASD. These results add to the increasing amount of data that supports the use of VR in therapeutic settings for people with ASD [31].\nThe increasing use of virtual reality (VR) as a tool to meet the psychological requirements of people with high-functioning autism, particularly in the population with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is highlighted in this scoping review. The report groups data on social skills, eye gazing and joint attention, motor learning, and job training after analyzing 23 experimental trials. Notwithstanding the potential of virtual reality, the study reveals a paucity of studies providing useful therapies to improve adaptive functioning in people with high-functioning ASD. Notably, half of the studies included participants under the age of 18, indicating that, in order to optimize long-term effects, future research should concentrate on early phases of development. The study emphasizes the necessity of more focused therapies to help young individuals with ASD get ready for obstacles in life [33].\nThe usefulness of immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy in treating phobias in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is investigated in this study. Because it demands abstract thinking, traditional cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven difficult for those with ASD; nevertheless, virtual reality (VR) offers a viable substitute. Through controlled exposure to a 360-degree projection of objects they fear, participants in the \"Blue Room\" gradually gain confidence under the guidance of therapists utilizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches. The majority of participants in two studies\u2014one on adults and the other on children\u2014showed improved functionality in daily life and considerable gains in controlling real-world phobias. The study highlights VR's potential as a formidable tool in ASD therapy, offering a methodical but adaptable way to get over anxieties [34].\nThe study [35] offers a creative and methodical strategy for teaching kids with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through virtual reality (VR). Compared to traditional approaches, the design saves time and money by using Unity3D to build a virtual environment that mimics real-world circumstances and facilitates immersive learning. The system's usefulness is improved by the inclusion of a website for managing child information and updates, enabling smooth communication between parents, specialists, and the VR environment.\nThe study offers a creative and methodical strategy for teaching kids with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through virtual reality (VR).

The system's usefulness is improved by the inclusion of a website for managing child information and updates, enabling smooth communication between parents, specialists, and the VR environment.\nChildren who participated in testing showed better engagement and adaption to the VR setting, which is encouraging. Test-related difficulties, such getting users acclimated to virtual reality technology, are resolved by educational movies. Upcoming improvements will encompass adding sentence-level interactions, enhancing the realism of the locations, and broadening the VR scenarios to encompass a variety of places such as shopping centers and hospitals.\nAll things considered, the AutiVE system shown in figure 7. has considerable promise as a teaching aid, fostering the growth of kids with ASD and representing a major advancement in the use of virtual reality into teaching methods. A useful tool for behavioral research, virtual reality (VR) systems allow for the construction of immersive 3D settings and precise monitoring of reactions to visual stimuli. Using this technology, researchers can gather data from sizable participant groups outside of conventional labs and investigate intricate theories like interceptive timing behavior with objects traveling in non-standard trajectories. Nevertheless, game developers-not behavioral scientists are the target audience for current 3D graphics engines like Unity. The Unity Experiment Framework (UXF) was created to make the process of developing VR experiments simpler in order to address this. Using Unity's full potential for stimulus display, UXF offers a programming interface for encoding typical experimental features and changing independent variables [36]. Primarily aimed at helping children with modest learning difficulties develop their socio-emotional skills, augmented reality (AR) has demonstrated potential in improving autism interventions. Approaches that cater to the needs of autistic children with complicated demands and significant learning difficulties are nevertheless required (SLN). In response, \"Magic Bubbles\"\u2014a multimodal augmented reality environment\u2014was built with input from stakeholders, modified for usage in a day hospital setting, and tested for acceptance and usefulness with children who have SLN and autism. Three main questions are examined in this study: 1) How well does Magic Bubbles assist kids with autism who have SLN? 2) Does it improve how these kids and practitioners connect with each other? 3) How would you rate the overall quality of these kids' experiences? Over the course of three months, seven children with SLN attended at least six weekly sessions. The study used grounded theory to evaluate the children's experiences, combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies. While emphasizing opportunities for future growth, the results also demonstrate that Magic Bubbles is helpful in aiding children with SLN, enhancing their interactions with practitioners, and offering a positive overall experience [37].\nWith its tremendous impact on recreational and educational activities, virtual reality (VR) technology holds great potential for children with specific educational needs (SEN), especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). For students with ASD, virtual reality (VR) provides a range of tools, including interactive 3D simulations, that can improve social, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive skills as well as everyday chores. The advantages of virtual reality (VR) in education are emphasized in this research review, which also mentions a variety of tools and apps utilized with ASD children. Although there is hope for virtual reality, further study is required to completely comprehend how beneficial it is in learning environments. The paper offers a thorough analysis of recent VR applications along with case studies that show how effective the technology is in helping kids with ASD. It highlights how important it is to have a strong theoretical foundation in order to optimize virtual reality's educational advantages and raise these pupils' standard of living. The review also predicts that in the future, educators will be able to provide more customized virtual reality experiences for students with ASD [38].\nThis study delves into the application of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the education of children with autism, an area of study that has been ongoing for more than 20 years. In safe and regulated virtual environments, virtual reality (VR) provides immersive \"real world\" situations that can support social and life skills training. There is now more interest in the possible uses of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) for autism education due to the recent release of reasonably priced models like Google Cardboard and Oculus Rift. After a thorough analysis of empirical research on VR-HMDs for people with autism spectrum disorders, few studies with different participant characteristics, applications, and technological backgrounds were found. Though the report emphasizes the need for more research to generate strong recommendations for establishing and maintaining VR-based educational techniques, there is some hope over VR's potential benefits. Being the first to assess the data supporting VR-HMD technology in helping people with autism, this literature study is noteworthy [39]. In order to evaluate the impact of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) approaches on cognitive, social, and emotional skills in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), this research systematically evaluates and meta-analyzes Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). The study indicates that, in comparison to control groups, VR therapies significantly improve social skills, emotional skills, and cognitive abilities by examining data from six RCTs. The assessment emphasizes VR's promise as a useful tool for honing these abilities in a flexible and regulated setting, but it also points out issues with accessibility, cost, and customisation. In order to better serve people with ASD, the study recommends conducting additional research to address these issues and improve VR-based therapies [41].\nA meta-analysis carefully reviewed and synthesized data from 33 research in order to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) on training and rehabilitation for people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a wide range of VR and ASD-related search phrases, a thorough search was carried out across several clinical and technical databases, including PubMed, ERIC, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE. Research on randomized controlled trials and other strong designs that evaluated VR therapies for ASD were the main focus of the rigorous inclusion criteria that were used to choose the studies. Effect sizes were used to assess the data, and subgroups were looked at depending on a variety of factors, including age, the kind of VR technology being used, and the existence of comorbidities. Subgroup meta-regressions were used to examine the influence of continuous moderator variables, and the meta-analysis took into account both formal and non-formal measures of efficacy [42].\nIn a research study the authors examined how various immersive technologies affected the ability of four to six-year-olds to share physical stickers, walk upon request, and exercise social conformity. The study focused on the children's media character Groover from Sesame Street. Youngsters (N = 52) used Grover on TV or in virtual reality to perform the Simon Says inhibitory control test. When playing Simon Says, children who used VR were less likely than those who used TV to repress a dominant motoric response, which is when they didn't mimic Grover's motions at the right moment. In comparison to the TV condition, more kids in the VR condition approached Grover and shared more stickers with him (among those who shared). Conditions did not differ in terms of children's pleasure of the experience or their level of emotional or physical suffering [44].\nThe meta-analysis showed that VR training has a large overall effect size (Hedges' $g = 0.74$), significantly improving a variety of skills in people with ASD. With an effect size of 1.15, the analysis showed that improving daily living skills was the area in which VR interventions were most successful. For social and communication abilities ($g = 0.69$), emotion control and recognition ($g = 0.46$), and cognitive skills ($g = 0.45$), moderate effects were seen. Furthermore, augmented reality-based therapies displayed a positive effect size of 0.92. These results highlight VR's potential as a helpful tool for ASD rehabilitation, but they also highlight the need for additional study to solve standardization and personalization concerns [42].\nThe ARISP module for teaching and learning activities is observed being implemented, and semi-structured interviews with preschool instructors are part of the research technique. The study looks at how kids engage with augmented reality (AR) technology, how they react to an immersive learning environment, and how they acquire the abilities necessary for digital literacy. The ARISP module considerably raises children's motivation and participation in learning activities, according to the findings. AR technology's interactive features improve problem-solving abilities and encourage a deeper comprehension of STEM subjects. The ARISP module has great potential for improving early childhood education through the combination of innovative technology and conventional teaching methods [46].\nA thorough meta-analysis of 134 (quasi-)experimental research on the use of augmented reality (AR) in education from 2012 to 2021 is presented in this article. It classifies how AR affects learning outcomes at three different levels: performance, knowledge and skill, and response. According to the analysis, augmented reality (AR) improves all three outcomes, with performance being most affected. The meta-regression's main finding is that treatment duration has a big impact on how much AR happens. Furthermore, compared to science courses, AR tends to encourage greater learner responses in language and social studies. The study also emphasizes how crucial it is to carefully plan and assess 3D visualization in augmented reality. Ultimately, the article explores the consequences for utilizing AR in the classroom and offers potential avenues for further investigation [47]."}, {"title": "3.2 Large Language Models (LLMs) in Enhancing Communication", "content": "The advent of LLMs, such as GPT and BERT, has opened new avenues for supporting communication in children with ASD. These models can generate natural language responses, assist in language learning, and provide real-time feedback during interactions. Research by Mishra et al. (2024) [13] and Jang et al. (2024) [16] suggests that LLMs can be used to create personalized learning experiences, where the content is adapted based on the child's language proficiency and communication needs.\nLLMs can also be integrated into AR environments to enhance the interactivity and relevance of the content presented to children with ASD. For instance, LLMs can provide explanations or prompts during AR-based learning sessions, helping children better understand the tasks they are engaged in. The potential for LLMs to be used as assistive technologies for communication is also explored by Woolsey et al. (2024) [15], who highlight the importance of designing these models with accessibility in mind to ensure they are effective for children with varying levels of ASD.\nThe applications of large language models (LLMs) and other therapies in the emotional and developmental contexts of children and individuals with autism are summarized in this review of recent research.\nA notable study presented ChaCha, a chatbot designed to help kids express their emotions. Twenty participants, ages eight to twelve, were included in the exploratory study. It was shown that ChaCha successfully encouraged kids to communicate intimate details and feelings, which made the chatbot seem like a close friend [26]. This suggests that LLMs have the ability to foster nurturing environments for kids, assisting them in navigating the often difficult process of emotional communication because of their immature language skills.\nThe advent of generative AI tools in education, especially LLMs like ChatGPT, has forced schools to reevaluate their writing curricula [27]. Although there is a lot of interest in using LLMs to improve kids' writing skills, there isn't much research available at the moment. Since LLMs were originally intended for adult users, there are still questions over whether or not they are suitable for younger users, despite the fact that their early use suggests they can offer helpful writing support.\nThe contribution of LLMs to raising children's health literacy is a crucial topic of research. A study evaluated various LLMs' responses to questions regarding pediatric medical issues, with an emphasis on the outputs' readability [28]. The outcomes showed that LLMs could provide responses that were appropriate for different reading levels, indicating their potential as instruments to support kids in understanding complicated health information. The study did note, however, that creating content that is suitable for younger audiences presents certain difficulties, indicating the need for additional LLM capability improvement.\nAdults with autism who have social communication issues can also benefit from LLMs. A study looked at how these people used an LLM chatbot to get help with social interactions at work [29]. The fact that participants clearly preferred the chatbot to a human confederate shows how valuable LLMs are at offering a platform where people can ask for assistance without feeling judged. There is a conflict between the requirement for normative guidance from subject-matter experts and user happiness, as seen by concerns expressed on the caliber of counsel provided by the LLM.\nIn a research [50] three main studies are done: the caliber of essays written by students who use LLMs, the efficacy of LLM detection systems, and the views of students regarding the use of LLMs in the classroom. The study indicated places for improvement for both students and educators, but it also demonstrated that essays written with LLM support were of good quality. Thirteen LLM detectors were tested, and none of them worked well enough to support the conclusion against outlawing LLMs. Furthermore, according to recognized technological acceptance models, a questionnaire revealing student evaluations of the usefulness and acceptance of LLMs was good. The study emphasizes the necessity of more investigation and modifications to teaching methods, particularly with regard to the incorporation of LLMs into classroom settings [50].\nLast but not least, studies on therapies for kids with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have demonstrated how successful evidence-based methods like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) are at lowering stereotyped behaviors (30). Significant improvements were observed in the study among the patients who received interventions, highlighting the significance of early therapy and family participation. Future research should examine broader factors influencing treatment outcomes, as the data also indicated gender variations in response to interventions.\nThese studies show the ways that LLMs and organized interventions can promote emotional communication, improve educational practices, raise health literacy, and assist people with autism, but they also point up areas that need more investigation and improvement."}, {"title": "3.3 UI/UX Design in ASD-Focused Applications", "content": "Effective UI/UX design is critical in ensuring that AR and LLM-based interventions are accessible, engaging, and beneficial for children with ASD. The user interface must be intuitive, with clear instructions and minimal distractions, to accommodate the cognitive and sensory sensitivities common in children with ASD. Studies by Lian et al. (2023) [7] and Zubair et al. (2023) [19] emphasize the need for UI/UX designs that are tailored to the unique needs of children with ASD, including the use of calming colors, simple layouts, and easy-to-navigate menus.\nMoreover, eye-tracking studies, such as those conducted by Lian et al. (2023) [7], have shown that children with ASD can benefit from interfaces that adapt to their gaze patterns, reducing the cognitive load and enhancing their engagement with the content. UI/UX designs that incorporate feedback mechanisms, such as rewards or progress indicators, can also motivate children to engage more consistently with the interventions [9].\nThis study examines the complex interrelationships between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design, emphasizing the differences and similarities between the two fields. It highlights how crucial user-centered design is becoming in the rapidly changing digital environment. The study explores how new developments, mainly in artificial intelligence (AI), are influencing customer satisfaction overall by reshaping human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX). Through an examination of these developments, the study provides insightful information on the direction digital product design will take and how the customer experience will change in the future [32]."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "The review highlights the noteworthy possibilities of incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs), Augmented Reality (AR), and User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) design into therapies for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By offering immersive and interactive environments that are tailored to the specific needs of kids with ASD, augmented reality (AR) has shown itself to be a useful tool for improving social interaction and learning. Language learning and communication can benefit greatly from the assistance of LLMs, who can design customized and flexible learning programs. It is impossible to exaggerate the significance of good UI/UX design since it guarantees that these interventions are approachable, interesting, and catered to the cognitive and sensory needs of kids with ASD.\nNotwithstanding the encouraging results, there are still issues to be resolved, such as the requirement for content personalization, enhancements to accessibility, and improved technology integration. Future studies should concentrate on resolving these problems and investigating ways to optimize UI/UX design, AR, and LLMs to deliver more tailored and efficient treatments. The quality of life and developmental outcomes for kids with ASD could be greatly enhanced by further developments in these fields."}]}

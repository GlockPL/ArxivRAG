Prior work has utilized predefined sets of rules or principles to steer the behavior of models (Bai et al., 2022b; Sun et al., 2023). However, these principles tend to be generic, making it challenging to adapt them to each individual input query or context. In this work, we present SITUATED-PRINCIPLES (SPRI), a framework requiring minimal or no human effort that is designed to automatically generate guiding principles in real-time for each input query and utilize them to align each response. We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness.

Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive performance across diverse applications (Achiam et al., 2024; Dubey et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2024; Groeneveld et al., 2024). However, in more complex tasks, human-expert-crafted prompts are required to achieve the desired level of performance. For example, Zhan et al. (2024) showed that LLMs are capable of generating high-quality cognitive reappraisals when guided by \"constitutions\" written by clinical psychologists with doctoral degrees. LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) is another prominent application that typically requires carefully crafted evaluation criteria to align with human annotators (Yu et al., 2023; Hashemi et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2024).\nTo better guide LLMs, several prior works utilized principles or constitutions in the context of synthetic data generation for alignment (Bai et al., 2022b; Sun et al., 2023). Such approaches are effective at reducing data annotation efforts, however, they are limited by the general nature of such principles making them hard to interpret in a given context, even for humans (Kirk et al., 2023a;b). For example, Bai et al. (2022b) employed the constitutional principle \"Identify specific ways in which the assistant's last response is\nCognitive reappraisal is a strategy commonly practiced by clinical psychologists to foster long-term emotional well-being (Arnold, 1960; Gross & John, 2003; Yeo & Ong, 2023).

(2022b) introduced Constitutional AI, a method relying on a list of predefined hand-crafted rules or constitutional principles that aim to promote safe, reliable, and effective systems. Leveraging Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) (Lee et al., 2024), Constitutional AI uses these principles to create AI-generated self-critiques to enhance the models autonomously. During the self-critique process, however, only a single rule is randomly chosen to scrutinize the existing response. Sun et al. (2023) improves on this approach by incorporating 16 manually-devised guiding principles that entail broader domains and more specific criteria, such as candorness, step-by-step justifications, and multi-faceted answers. By broadening the range of topics, they allow the language model to decide which principles to adhere to given user queries. However, these approaches are resource-intensive and demand significant human labor, as they necessitate explicitly predefined guiding principles.\nPrior work has recognized the importance of guiding LLM generations using principles situated in the particular context at hand, such as allowing users to formulate principles"}, {"title": "3. SPRI: A Scalable Alignment Framework with Minimal Human Oversight", "content": "We present SITUATED-PRINCIPLES (SPRI), a framework that generates context-situated principles to align LLMs while minimizing human oversight. The framework relies on two ingredients: a base model M and a critic model C. An overview of SPRI is shown in Figure 2. To generate an aligned response, SPRI goes through two steps: during the first stage, M takes in the user's input T and generates a set of principles customized to T through a series of critique-refinement loops with C; then in the second stage, the generated principles are fed into M to guide its response. These principles also serve as criteria to provide feedback on the generated responses for improvement. We provide the pseudo-code algorithms in Appendix \u00a7A.\nStage I: Synthesizing Context-Situated Principles. Based on a user's input T, the objective of the first step is to generate guiding principles tailored to T. Given T, the base model M is prompted with \\(P_{principle-gen}\\) to produce an initial set of principles, \\(K_0\\), as follows:\n\\(K_0 = M(T \\oplus P_{principle-gen} \\oplus S),\\)\nwhere \\(\\oplus\\) denotes concatenation and \\(P_{principle-gen}\\) is a prompt instructing the model to generate principles (see Appendix \u00a7B). A set of seed (instruction, principle) tuples, denoted as S, can also be provided as few-shot examples for the model to better grasp the essence of desired principles. We note that the provision of seed examples is optional: this initial principle-generation phase can be rendered under a zero-shot setting.\nAs the next step, we need to determine the adequacy of \\(K_0\\) and assess whether it is suitable for guiding the response to T. We use the critic model C to yield feedback on \\(K_0\\):\n\\(Feedback_{K_0} = C(Eval_{principle} \\oplus T \\oplus K_0).\\)\nHere, \\(Eval_{principle}\\) is a chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) style evaluation prompt in the format of direct assessment (Kim et al., 2024b) that instructs C to produce both qualitative feedback and a numerical score (on a 1 to 5 Likert scale). The feedback is fed back into the base model M, prompting it to refine the principles:\n\\(K_i = M(P_{principle-refine} \\oplus T \\oplus K_{i-1} + Feedback_{K_{i-1}}),\\)\nwhere \\(P_{principle-refine}\\) is a prompt instructing the model to refine principles based on feedback. This iterative critique-refinement process continues until the principles receive a desired score of at least 4 or a maximum of four iterations is reached. We denote the final set of principles deemed suitable to guide the response to T as \\(K_{final}\\)."}, {"title": "4. SPRI for Complex Principles", "content": "We examine the effectiveness of SPRI on complex real-world tasks, one where LLMs are shown only to be successful if provided with complex, expert-curated principles in the prompt (Zhan et al., 2024), another on a larger benchmark where manually curated situation-specific rubrics are necessary (Kim et al., 2024a). We show that SPRI generates effective principles for complex tasks in the former (\u00a74.1), and also generates evaluation rubrics for instance-level assessment in the latter (\u00a74.2). We provide example SPRI-generated principles in Appendix \u00a7I.\n4.1. Can SPRI Guide Cognitive Reappraisals?\nWe explore how SPRI can be applied to facilitate cognitive reappraisals, a strategy widely recognized by psychology practitioners that aims to promote long-term mental well-being for an individual (Gross, 1998; Gross & John, 2003; Waugh et al., 2016).

Ablation Study", "content": "To better tease apart and analyze the success of SPRI, we study the impact of seed examples provided in the initial principle generation stage. We first remove seed examples from the SPRI pipeline. We denote this approach by -seed=[none]. In order to further demonstrate the robustness of SPRI, we insert generic principles (shown in Appendix \u00a7C Figure 3) as seed examples, and denote this modification as -seed=[default_principles]. We showcase the results in Table 3. Removing seed examples entirely leads to an average performance degradation of 4.13% in alignment for reappraisals and 13.37% in Pearson's correlation for rubric generation. On the other hand, substituting the default principles as seeds leads to a similar average performance decrease of 4.01% in alignment and 12.35% in Pearson's correlation for rubric generation. These results highlight the robustness of SPRI to seed examples in the initial principle-generation stage, as our default principles are neither relevant to the tasks we evaluate nor fit to the instances we aim to provide guidance with.\nAdditionally, to better understand the influence of the seed principles on SPRI, we also experiment with a separate condition default principles only, where we randomly select one of the six default principles and include it as both"}, {"title": "5. Can SPRI Generate Large-Scale Alignment Data for Supervised Fine-Tuning?", "content": "Finally, we apply SPRI to a more general setting: generating large-scale synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Through evaluating language models fine-tuned on our synthetically generated data, we indirectly assess the capability of SPRI. Intrinsically, SPRI's context-situated principles allow for a deeper ability to reject misleading claims as exhibited in Appendix \u00a7I.3, when provided with questions that don't have a definite answer (e.g., \"Is it true that if you don't exercise your body will become weaker?\"), SPRI often generates guiding principles that asks the response to focus on both sides of the question. Based on the nature of SPRI, we hypothesize that SPRI would perform best on benchmarks that measure the rejection of falsehoods, whilst maintaining the performance in the knowledge as well as problem-solving domains.\n5.1.

Experimental Setup", "content": "Data. To examine the generalizability of SPRI, we carry out experiments on two different instruction-tuning datasets D, namely Dolly (Conover et al., 2023) and MixInstruct (Jiang et al., 2023). Dolly contains around 15k manually curated prompt-response pairs, whereas MixInstruct consists of 110k examples where the responses are primarily sourced from GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. We randomly split Dolly into a 10k/2k split for training and validation. For MixInstruct, we randomly select 50k examples from its training set and 2k examples from its validations set.\nBaseline Methods. We experiment with a variety of baselines, including 1) oracle response, where we fine-tune directly on the oracle responses provided in the datasets. 2) direct response, in which we collect responses by asking the base model M to directly respond to the instructions for each instance in the dataset. 3) self-instruct, where we elicit responses from M by relying on a few-shot prompt with 11 (input, output) example pairs from Wang et al. (2023). 4) topic-guided red-teaming, a prompt from Sun et al. (2023), in which a set of 16 general rules as well as few-shot examples demonstrating how to utilize these rules in a chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) fashion are used to elicit responses. 5) self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023), where we ask the base model M to critic and refine its own response. During critiquing, we ask the model to provide feedback followed by an integer assessment score from 1 to 5. We iterate the critique-refine process until a minimal assessment score of 4 is met or the maximum number of iterations of"}, {"title": "5.3. Results", "content": "We evaluate the performance of fine-tuned models on several benchmarks, namely TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), MUSR (Sprague et al., 2024), GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024), and Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019). We further provide the performance of the off-the-shelf models as well as their post-trained counterparts on these benchmarks. As shown in Table 4, SPRI consistently outperforms the off-the-shelf model as well as other synthetic response generation methods on the TruthfulQA dataset. In particular, fine-tuning base models using SPRI leads to the most notable gains on the benchmark, surpassing the off-the-shelf models' performance by an average of 24.76% and models"}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "We introduce SPRI, a framework that produces context-situated principles tailored to each input query at hand. Through a series of extensive evaluations on tasks including cognitive reappraisals, instance-specific rubric generation, and generating synthetic data for SFT, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPRI in guiding responses. By dynamically generating principles in real time with minimal or no human effort, SPRI addresses key limitations of prior approaches that relied on generic, static principles. Our results show that SPRI not only matches expert-level performance in highly specialized tasks but also enhances alignment with human judgment and improves synthetic data generation for model fine-tuning. This work underscores the potential of SPRI to enable more adaptable, context-aware, and scalable alignment strategies for LLMs, paving the way for broader applicability in tasks requiring nuanced human oversight and guidance."}, {"title": "B.

Examples from Cognitive Reappraisal\n(i)\n\u2022 User input: I'm currently completing my A levels (a series of exam you do in the UK at the age of 17/18, that determine whether you get into university)... as you can imagine, I have been stressed. I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure to get very high grades (straight A's). I've completed 2 exams, and have 5 left to go, 3 of which I'll be sitting tomorrow, the next day, and the day after that...\nI'm shocked at how this stress has effected me physically. I've always been fairly neurotic, but the anxiety I tend to feel is transient, and is rarely severe enough to manifest in anything physically significant, beyond a raised pulse and slight breathlessness.\nI knew I was getting myself *way* too worked up when I started to pull out hair in the shower. I have very thick hair, so a lot of it was coming out. I've had severe brain fog, which hasn't been the least bit helpful during a time when I have to be the most alert and *with it*'. I've had no appetite, and now my trousers are all loose, with one pair literally falling down when I walk. The most bizarre symptom I've had is this weird jaw tension - my jaw is very clicky, and it feels incredibly tense and stiff. As a hypochondriac, I was convinced this was a heart attack, but I was reassured that it's probably just anxiety. I've had weird gastrointestinal symptoms, where I feel nauseous, and have this pit in my stomach all of the time, which could be caused by the lack of eating, but it persists even when I have eaten.\nAnd then of course feelings of impending doom, etc etc.\nI just can't wait for this to be over.\n\u2022 Reappraisal Goal: To guide the narrator over their perception of their responsibility for causing the situation.\n\u2022 Oralce Principles: If the narrator is stressing over things they are not responsible for, tell them that it may not require as much responsibility as they think and not to worry about them too much (depending on how high they perceive their level of responsibility in the situation). However, if the person is doing something wrong/inappropriate and not feeling any responsibility or it (low responsibility), you should kindly but objectively encourage them to re-appraise the situation (or maybe think in the other person's perspective) and consider what they could be responsible for, and change the situation. Provide realistic and specific guidelines.\n\u2022 SPRI-Generated Principles (using GPT-40-mini): Recognize that the pressure and stress experienced during exams are shared by many and not solely the narrator's responsibility. Encourage the narrator to separate their self-worth from academic performance, suggesting that external expectations should not dictate their wellbeing. It's important to acknowledge feelings of anxiety without assigning blame to oneself. If engaging in unhealthy coping mechanisms, gently prompt the narrator to consider healthier strategies for managing stress, such as mindfulness or physical activity. Reframe the experience as an opportunity for growth rather than a measure of success or failure, reinforcing that asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\u2022 SPRI-Generated Response (using GPT-40-mini): It's entirely normal to feel overwhelmed during A levels; many experience similar stress. Remember, your worth isn't tied to your grades. External pressures should not dictate your wellbeing. Acknowledge your feelings without self-blame. Instead of resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms, consider healthier strategies like mindfulness or gentle physical activity to ease tension. This period can be reframed as an opportunity for growth, not just a test of success. Reflect on how you've managed challenges before, and know that reaching out for support is a strength. Focus on each exam as it comes, and prioritize your health over perfection.\n(ii)\n\u2022 User input: My mental health was never great before the pandemic but I felt more grounded. Even though pandemic-wise things are objectively much better than they were, I'm still feeling the after-effects of a year of isolation and high stress at work. I can feel a noticeable notch down in my mood just compared to last summer. I feel dead inside and doing anything requires a huge amount of energy. I feel sad all the time, I cry more. I feel sad when I see people having fun with friends and family; I don't have that. My family isn't great and I have no contact with them. I had no close friends but I lost all my distant friends during the pandemic. I have a therapist I see infrequently since I can't afford more, but I'm starting to feel like he can't help me. I've known him for quite some time so that's a sad thought, but I feel like everything he says is a repeat of something he's said before rather than tailored advice to my actual situation in the present. We all repeat ourselves to some extent. I probably need a fresh perspective, I don't know. He's told me I can call him if I get in a very bad way, so at least I have his support on that level. I don't expect any advice or solution to this. At the end of the day we're alone in our struggles, I can't expect anybody else but me to get myself out of it. But I feel like sharing it to somebody."}, {"title": "I.2.

The following research documents a co-design process with interdisciplinary K-12 teachers to explore and address the current PBL challenges they face.

Unlike traditional instructional methods, PBL emphasizes student-centered pedagogy, where learners actively construct knowledge through exploration, collaboration, and reflection [32, 89, 99]. By providing students with opportunities to explore topics of personal and cultural relevance, PBL supports diverse learning needs and backgrounds, making education more inclusive and accessible.\nWhile PBL offers significant benefits to students, it also necessitates a fundamental shift in educators' roles from knowledge providers to learning facilitators [41, 112]. This requires educators to adopt new pedagogical strategies, manage complex classroom dynamics and provide ongoing, formative assessments that support student learning [5, 110]. Challenges to PBL implementation include designing standards-aligned projects that meet diverse student needs, managing planning time, transitioning students to active"}, {"title": "1.1 Our Contribution", "content": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first co-design study with K-12 teachers aimed specifically at incorporating LLMs into PBL pedagogy. Given the unprecedented and rapidly advancing nature of GenAI and its ethical considerations, our research is particularly timely. Our research objectives (RO) include:\n(1) Explore Demands and Challenges in PBL: We investigated specific challenges educators encounter when implementing PBL in their classrooms, focusing on how they assess student learning outcomes in areas such as teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving.\n(2) Co-design GenAI Tools for PBL: Next, we explored how GenAI-powered tools, co-designed with interdisciplinary educators, could address diverse needs and challenges of PBL environments. Our co-design workshops examined how these tools could alleviate teachers' workloads while supporting their current practices, pedagogical goals, and professional growth. We constructed wireframes embodying teachers' values and received iterative feedback, from teachers with diverse expertise, on their potential integration into PBL environments.\n(3) Outline Design Considerations for LLM Tools in PBL: Finally, we propose a set of design guidelines for LLM tools that educational technology designers and educators may find valuable for assessing student progress, setting learning goals, providing iterative and personalized feedback, and managing resources, timelines, and artifacts across different student projects and milestones.\nOur findings provide valuable insights into shaping the future use of LLMs in PBL, guiding and encouraging its responsible implementation in classrooms. It should be noted that although we used the term GenAI for the study framing with our participants, they focused on a particular type of GenAI: LLMs for their proposed solutions. Because of this duality, both these terms are used in this paper."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Project-Based Learning", "content": "Rooted in constructivist learning theories, project-based learning (PBL) places students at the center of the learning process, challenging conventional education practices and redefining the roles of teaching, learning, and school organization [45, 49, 66, 142]. Unlike problem-based learning, which promotes promotes deductive reasoning [32, 131], and involves structured evaluation based on how well a student's solution addresses a defined problem (e.g., designing a more effective trash can to improve adoption or conducting participatory action research on a social issue), project-based learning engages students in complex, real-world tasks to create a broader range of artifacts (e.g. reports, models, and presentations) that demonstrate learning [14, 27, 68, 90, 130, 131] (e.g., using photo-journalism to explore local flora and fauna or writing a comic book to analyze tropes in the hero's journey). This fosters creativity and critical thinking through open-ended driving questions (e.g. \"what is the proper role of government in a democracy?\") [16, 35, 95, 124].\nResearch has consistently demonstrated the numerous benefits of PBL across various educational contexts. Unlike traditional instruction, PBL (1) encourages students to delve deeply into the subject matter, fostering a more profound understanding of the material [17, 27, 94, 115]; (2) enhances mastery of subjects and supports the development of critical 21st-century skills like collaboration and communication [27, 32, 89, 99]; (3) boosts motivation, and engagement [15, 16, 55, 58, 60, 61]; and (4) develops metacognitive skills by helping students assess their progress and continuously improve [15, 40, 129, 131, 134].\nWhile PBL is inherently student-centered, the success of this approach is heavily influenced by the role of teachers as facilitators, guiding and scaffolding student learning [14]. This shift in roles and professional identity requires teachers to adapt their pedagogical approaches and develop new skills, often leading to greater ownership, self-efficacy, and confidence in their teaching [29, 54, 101]. However, transitioning to PBL often requires targeted professional development (PD) that provides teachers with peer collaboration, reflection, and ongoing support during PBL implementation [2, 16, 37, 102, 143]. Given the pivotal role of teachers in harnessing PBL benefits, our research reveals their needs and explores how LLMs could support them in successfully implementing PBL and foster continued professional growth.\nTo maximize the effectiveness of these tools, it is essential to consider challenges teachers encounter during PBL implementation, especially around generating authentic driving questions, managing time and group work, and balancing instructor-led guidance with student-directed learning [85, 130, 147]. Students' discomfort with the cognitive and social demands of PBL can lead to frustration, particularly among high-achieving students accustomed to traditional instruction [32]. In addition, teachers face challenges initiating inquiry, facilitating dialogue, and scaffolding learning [62, 69, 103, 105, 106]. Assessing student learning in PBL is also notably difficult, as traditional tests often fail to capture the depth of understanding that PBL aims to develop. Performance-based assessments are hard to implement reliably [10, 34, 56, 85], student artifacts can be difficult to score consistently, and teachers lack the time to provide personalized student feedback [53]. Integrating"}, {"title": "2.2 AI Tools to Support PBL Pedagogical Needs", "content": "Al's capacity to personalize learning is beneficial in PBL settings where differentiated instruction is crucial. Al tools can support targeted instruction by tailoring lessons for diverse learners, encouraging student iteration on artifacts, and adapting materials to individual student strengths and weaknesses [4, 11, 67]. Helping students manage time and materials efficiently, tools like Trello and Cronofy, integrated with Al plug-ins, can predict resource needs [127]. AI-assisted design tools like Autodesk Dreamcatcher and intelligent project management software such as Asana and Monday.com can facilitate student project management, allowing them to focus on creative and critical thinking [127].\nConsidering project collaboration and knowledge construction [11, 38, 127], research scholars have discussed how AI can evaluate group performance by analyzing interaction patterns and predicting outcomes based on academic and behavioral data, enabling more effective grouping strategies [24, 113]. Al systems can also guide students toward productive problem-solving, suggesting activities on collaborative styles, and pedagogical interventions to improve group work [1, 39, 70]. Considering grading in PBL, AI-powered assessment systems, such as Automated Essay Scoring (AES) and Automated Written Corrective Feedback (AWCF), can offer real-time, continuous feedback, helping students to refine their work iteratively [33, 109]. These systems not only reduce the teacher's workload but also enhance the accuracy and efficiency of grading, allowing teachers to focus on more meaningful interactions with students [93]. AI can also support formative assessment practices in PBL by providing insights into students' progress, helping teachers guide and support students more effectively [74].\nDespite potential benefits, integrating LLMs into PBL presents challenges, such as biased algorithms, that necessitates careful design and human oversight to ensure fairness and accuracy in assessment and feedback [114]. Comprehensive PD is needed for teachers to use LLM tools responsibly and equitably [9, 74], understand their long-term effects across age groups and subject areas, and address ethical concerns like data privacy [11, 140, 144]. In our current work, we aim to overcome some of these challenges by co-designing GenAI-powered support systems with teachers in PBL settings. This is unlike recent studies that have focused on co-designing these tools with students in the higher education contexts [50, 88, 146, 147]. We also examine challenges more unique to K-12 PBL, that emphasizes scaffolding and skill-building [32]."}, {"title": "2.3 Co-designing Educational Tools with Teachers", "content": "Co-design is a collaborative, iterative process where teachers, researchers, and developers jointly design, prototype, and evaluate educational tools [108].

The shift from traditional assessments to more dynamic, project-based evaluations also demanded innovative assessment methods. P02 highlighted the challenges of evaluating open-ended projects without additional support staff in schools. Teachers grappled with balancing the depth of knowledge required for specific projects with the breadth of content mandated by the curriculum. This often meant that students developed an in-depth understanding of their chosen project topic but lacked comprehensive knowledge of other areas, impacting their performance on traditional assessments. Integrating technology also added complexity, with students' enthusiasm for new tools sometimes diverting focus from project goals. Additionally, the availability of resources and the need to create or adapt materials presented ongoing struggles. Teachers often felt constrained by their curriculum's scope and sequence, which limited their ability to fully embrace PBL's potential. Fair grading was particularly challenging due to the subjective nature of projects and the need for continuous feedback. P10 highlighted the workload involved:\n\"It's a lot of work. I'm constantly grading. I don't get a break because it's a continuous cycle of work. I give iterative feedback throughout, and my turnaround is as quick as possible, but it means grading all weekend.\" \u2013 P10\nMaintaining student engagement was another recurring challenge in PBL.

One suggestion was a \"dashboard to monitor progress with a traffic light system (red, yellow, green)\" (Group 1), for visual tracking. Another idea involved using a checklist in the form of a \"bingo board for final projects\" (Group 3). However, these tools sometimes failed when items were checked off without actual completion. Frequent check-ins and breaking projects into manageable tasks were also mentioned, though this process was noted to be labor-intensive due to the need for continuous tracking, timely feedback, and adjustments to lesson plans. Participants promoted student autonomy by \"maintaining momentum\" (Group 3) during classroom time, \"keeping project ideas fresh\" (Group 1), and organizing \"fun, creative tasks within projects to reduce cognitive and social discomfort\" (Group 1).

While LLMs can offer powerful capabilities in generating educational content and personalized learning materials [74, 93, 141, 147], teachers in our co-design workshops raised issues related to the accuracy and bias inherent in LLM-generated content, as seen in prior work [93, 114, 144]. LLMs could also undermine the fairness and inclusivity of educational practices due to this bias [43, 109, 114]. Our teachers expressed doubts about the reliability of LLMs in handling tasks that require a deep understanding of context or the subtle nuances involved in student expressions and creative multimodal artifacts [109, 114]. This skepticism reflects broader concerns about the limits of GenAI's interpretive abilities and risks associated with delegating too much of the evaluative process to technology [109, 147].\nThe feasibility of implementing LLMs in diverse educational settings was another significant issue. Our study highlighted concerns around logistical constraints, such as limited access to high-speed internet, adequate digital infrastructure, and computational resources, which can vary greatly across schools and districts [144]. These disparities raise concerns about digital equity, as schools with fewer resources may find themselves unable to leverage advanced LLM tools, potentially widening the gap in educational opportunities [74, 93].

However, our results caution against allowing efficiency gains to oversimplify the complex aspects of PBL, such as developing students' interpersonal skills, cultivating creativity, and supporting critical thinking-areas that require nuanced, human-centered guidance [74]. Similar to previous work, our teachers also feared that excessive automation could diminish opportunities for spontaneous, in-the-moment learning experiences and the development of soft skills that are crucial for student growth [28, 59].

We briefly describe the framework's seven PBL teaching practices (Figure 12) and unpack potential ways LLM systems can mitigate implementation barriers. We focus on recommendations that alleviate teachers' administrative workload in implementing high-quality PBL, allowing them to dedicate more time to the creative and fulfilling aspects of teaching. We advocate for these discussions to actively include new teachers, curriculum coaches, school boards, admins, information technology (IT) and special education committees - stakeholders our teachers emphasized as vital but often underrepresented in education tool design [100].

Build on established pedagogical practices of PBL educators, reducing the need for creating resources from scratch.\nOur results showed evidence of PBL teachers grappling with balancing the depth of knowledge required for specific projects with the breadth of content mandated by the curriculum. Teachers also raised concerns about the excessive contextual information required by current LLM systems and their ability to effectively prompt the LLM for specific tasks. A proposed solution is structured input: teachers specify contextual details such as specific learning goals, standards, desired final project artifacts, and duration of implementation, and LLM tools generate ideas aligned with curricular objectives and tailored to classroom needs. This structured input approach not only supports experienced educators but also provides novice PBL teachers with foundational knowledge for constructing high-quality PBL units.\nRecommendation 2: Provide Teacher-Directed Scaffolding with Flexibility\nDesign LLM tools for PBL that intentionally prioritize and mandate core teacher inputs, while offering optional customization features. This recommendation is rooted in two ideas from our research: (1) the need to promote high-quality pedagogy by ensuring that key LLM functionalities are integrated into teaching practices, while also providing flexibility for educators to choose supplementary features that support their unique classroom needs, (2) ensuring the LLM system has sufficient contextual information from the required inputs to generate high-quality resources.

The LLM tool should also facilitate the creation of two separate rubric sets: one for teachers and administrators, focusing on competencies from established standards, and another for students, emphasizing clear, actionable expectations tied to project outputs.\nRecommendation 6.1: Implement single-point rubrics as the default rubric type within LLM tools for PBL. Single-point rubrics use a single column for feedback instead of multiple performance levels. Research shows that such rubrics are quicker and easier for teachers to create since they don't need to anticipate all possible ways students might \"fail expectations\" [48]. For students, these rubrics are simpler to understand, focusing on clear target expectations. They also promote higher-quality feedback, as teachers highlight specific strengths and areas for improvement, fostering a growth mindset and iterative learning.\nRecommendation 6.2: Augment rubric items with detailed teacher feedback. Rubric items must be augmented with detailed feedback from teachers. Designers of the LLM tools should explore the possibility of providing a starting point for feedback from student submissions, allowing teachers to elaborate and personalize their notes [51, 125].\nRecommendation 6.3: Integrate LLM-assisted positive feedback to complement constructive criticism alongside rubrics. Our teachers mentioned struggling to provide granular positive feedback due to time constraints. Praise and celebration, bolstered by relevant specifics, can instill student confidence and promote balanced assessments.\nRecommendation 7: Ensure Privacy in LLM-Driven Differentiation\nEnsure that data processing and LLM interactions for differentiating student resources occur locally on the teacher's device or within a secure school network.\nTeachers in our study expressed significant concerns about privacy when using LLMs to differentiate rubrics for students with"}, {"title": "6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "Our study has limitations that suggest avenues for future research. First, our focus on PBL in the context of the United States limits the generalizability of the findings; future research should explore the applicability of LLM-driven PBL tools in culturally diverse educational settings globally. We also acknowledge the small sample size and absence of collected racial demographics information as limitations for generalizability. Additionally, our study involved a self-selected group of teachers who were likely more interested in GenAI and PBL, potentially biasing the findings toward a more positive outlook. Future work could include longer-term studies that investigate how such tools might engage teachers who are more resistant to PBL or GenAI integration. The wireframes developed in this study are only a starting point; building and testing a working product through iterative design cycles is crucial to evaluate the feasibility of GenAI for the proposed features. Future research should focus on co-designing student-facing supports that align with teacher tools, fostering an integrated flow of information and feedback to create a balanced ecosystem within the LLM-driven PBL experience."}]}

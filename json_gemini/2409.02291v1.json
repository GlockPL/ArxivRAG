It is elusive, however, due to the fact that human creativity is not fully understood and, thus, it is difficult to develop this capability in software. Large language models (LLMs) provide a facsimile of creativity and the appearance of sentience, while not actually being either creative or sentient. While LLMs have created bona fide new content, in some cases such as with harmful hallucinations \u2013 inadvertently, their deliberate creativity is seen by some to not match that of humans. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a technique for enhancing LLM output creativity via an iterative process of concept injection and refinement.

Introduction", "content": "The development of computer systems capable of creative thought has been a central theme of science fiction and a goal of computer programmers for some time. Problematically, creativity is inherently difficult to identify and evaluate, in many cases being a known-when-seen phenomena that those witnessing cannot necessarily explain their evaluation of. Additionally, evaluations of creativity are inherently subjective as what one person identifies as creative, another may dismiss. These determinations may differ based on the backgrounds and domain knowledge of the evaluators as well as their personal preferences and other factors.\nGiven that identifying and characterizing human creativity is difficult, tasking a computer to produce this ill-defined behavior and its results is challenging. However, the work presented herein starts from a goal of achieving human-level creativity (with its associated difficulties of identification and evaluation) and extrapolates to propose a system that produces a facsimile of creativity and its products. While not all of its products will be deemed creative by human evaluators, this work seeks to demonstrate the plausibility of software-based creativity through enhancing the creativity of large language models (LLMs). It combines human requirements for a product or solution, random prompt input generation and iterative evaluation and refinement to produce outputs which are designed to score well on conventional and LLM-specific metrics of creativity.\nThe Creative Artificial Intelligence through Recurring Developments and Determinations (CAIRDD) system is presented herein. First, prior work that the system builds upon is presented, in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, an overview of the system is provided and each area of system operations is described.

Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models", "content": "There are a wide variety of forms of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. These include popular techniques based on the human brain [1] and insects [2]. Logic-based techniques, including rule-fact expert systems [3] and particle swarm optimization [4] and less well known techniques, such as those based on water flows [5], also exist. Techniques are also commonly developed by combining other techniques.\nMany AI techniques are not designed to have their decision-making be readily human understandable [6]. Some techniques are forms of Explainable AI (XAI), which are can be understandable due to having \u201csome degree of\" inherent \"transparency\" and being \u201cinterpretable to an extent by themselves\" [7] or by having other techniques explain them [7]. AI has hound use for a wide variety of applications including environmental protection [8], business [9] and health care [10].\nOne popular form of AI is generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which creates new content. GAI systems have been developed to create text, images, videos and other media.\nLarge language models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) [11] and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERTs) [12], are among the most popular forms of AI. They are trained using a large corpus of text data and neural networks. Most are based [13] on transformers [14], which implemented a crucial self-attention mechanism allowing a model to assess an input sequence component parts importance during processing [15]. They can be used for translation, question-response, summarization, and text generation [16]. However, they also present several drawbacks including the potential to generate inappropriate [17], biased [17] and inaccurate [18] content.

Assessment of Human Creativity", "content": "Understanding human creativity has been an ongoing topic of study. Despite not fully understanding where it comes from, a number of studies have proposed evaluative mechanisms for it. The work presented herein builds on these mechanisms and uses them to assess the creativity of LLM-generated creative concepts.\nCropley [21] proffers that creativity metrics \"measure specific cognitive processes\". This measuring \u201cthinking differently, making associations, constructing and combining broad categories\u201d and \u201cworking on many ideas simultaneously\u201d along with \u201cnoncognitive aspects of creativity\u201d including \u201cmotivation\u201d and \u201cfacilitatory personal properties\" [21].\nSaid-Metwaly, Kyndt and Van den Noortgate [22] note that there are \u201cunresolved issues and serious questions\u201d regarding creativity measurement. They note that creativity measurement must consider instrument selection, \"sampling, testing conditions, psychometric properties\" and the generality or specificity of analysis desired [22]. Their review of the creativity literature indicates that creativity is measured using \"four major approaches\": \"process, person, product and press\".\nFillis and McAuley [23] propose a six-component model for creativity within organizations (focusing on marketing, in particular) which includes \u201ccreative potential\u201d, the \u201csocial environment and processes\u201d, \u201cthe creative individual\" and \"creative enterprise\" and \"cognitive skills\". These produce \u201cnew visualizations\u201d and \u201ccreative problem solving\" [23].\nLobert and Dologite [24] identified three dimensions of creativity evaluation: \u201cnovelty\u201d, \u201cresolution\u201d and \u201csynthesis & elaboration\".

The former was shown, in this study, to work better than the latter. While the comic strips were evaluated subjectively, objective measures of coherence and insincerity were applied to the joke generation. The approach used for model operations was shown to have a notable effect on these metrics, with sampling producing the most coherent and insincere jokes (98% coherent and 97.2% where not to sincere).

CAIRDD System Overview"}, {"content": "This section provides an overview of the CAIRDD system. CAIRDD's components are described in detail in the subsequent sections. Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the CAIRDD process and the interrelationship of the system's components.\nThe key concept of CAIRDD is to produce multiple creative concepts, refine them and evaluate them to arrive at the best concept or concepts to present to the user. Thus, while any one concept may not be suitable, the combination of numerous attempts \u2013 requiring no additional input per attempt by the user and their evaluation should produce a suitable output.\nThe CAIRDD process starts with a user supplied focus area, which sets the scope and requirements of the tasking of the system. This also informs the prompts that are used in later parts of the CAIRDD system. The focus area is augmented with randomly (or pseudo-randomly) generated idea injects. Each of the concept starts generated using"}, {"title": "3.1. User Focus Area", "content": "The initial step in the CAIRDD process is for the user to supply a general area of focus. While the system could be tasked with determining this, the goal is for the creativity to be focused on solving a user-supplied problem or producing a user-desired product. Given this, the initial focus area in CAIRDD is user-supplied. Of course, a user could prompt an LLM to supply a focus area, if desired; however, this is beyond the scope of the current work.\nThe user-supplied focus area should be described as specifically as possible without overly constraining the CAIRDD system with extraneous requirements. These requirements are the functional specifications for the solution or product produced. Any requirements that a solution or product must satisfy to be considered successful on post-creation evaluation should be supplied. However, if a solution or product could be successful without meeting a given requirement, it should not be specified. If a solution or product must meet one (or a fixed number) of a group of requirements, that should be specified (as opposed to specifying them all as being required).\nIn addition to requirements, users can also provide suggestions. However, as these may direct CAIRDD towards the user-supplied direction, it is prudent to run CAIRDD both without and with these suggestions, if they are to be provided. Notably, if CAIRDD is experiencing difficulties in generating a desired solution or product, suggestions may be effective in overcoming these difficulties and the system benefits notably from them being provided, in these instances."}, {"title": "3.2. Random/Pseudorandom Generation", "content": "In the random / pseudorandom generation step, random terminology is selected to incorporate as part of prompts to a LLM to generate creative ideas. This is effectively a \u2018brute force' approach to creativity, initially; however, the use of the rubrics to guide the approach later on is designed to result in optimal outcomes, as compared to a na\u00efve generation and evaluation process.\nFor this step, words are randomly generated. Any random or pseudo-random generation technique can be utilized for this. The identification of word characteristics that correlate with creative outcomes (e.g., word length, vocabulary level and other characteristics) is a key are of assessment.\nOnce these words are generated they are supplied to an LLM (Meta's Llama 3.1 Instruct model [51] is used in this work). An example pre-prompt (which was used for this testing) is shown in Listing 1. This pre-prompt is based on modifying the basic prompt used by LM Studio.\nWith this pre-prompt in place, a variety of different strategies for creative generation can be used. A single word or short phrase can be used as the input to the creative output. Prompts and responses for several single word / short phase examples are shown in Listing 2."}, {"title": "3.3. Fuzzing & Search Expansion", "content": "In this step, the prompts that are provided the LLM are increased through the creation of similar prompts. A variety of techniques are possible for this step and their evaluation is a key area of future work. Several simple approaches include the use of a thesaurus to replace words (both those that are user provided and those selected randomly by the system) with their synonyms. Every combination of synonym replacements could be attempted or the pathways to be pursued could be guided by the results of initial exploration down each one (i.e., if a particular replacement reduces the creativity evaluation scores across a few trials, additional trials with this replacement would not be attempted).\nAlternately, other techniques for choosing similar words could be used that do not rely on synonym identification. This could include choosing antonyms for system-selected words (antonym use for user specified words would not be appropriate, as this would likely result in failing to meet the user's goals). Word frequency analysis results could be used to substitute words that appear frequently in proximity to the words to be replaced \u2013 or to select words that do not appear frequently in proximity to the words. Additional random selection could also be used to replace a single word or subset of words in a multi-word prompt."}, {"title": "3.4.

This concept is supplied to the LLM for generation."}, {"title": "3.5. Rubric Definition", "content": "The rubric is designed to embody two dimensions of evaluation: efficacy of the concept and creativity of the concept.\nThe efficacy question is the easier of the two. A relevant metric for the intended use of the creative concept is defined based on the requirements for the particular application area. It is important that this be precisely aligned with the requirements for actual use (as opposed to embodying convention) to avoid penalizing creative ideas that are unconventional (and, thus, undermining the point of the system).\nThe creativity question is more complex and subjective. Multiple methods for evaluating creativity based on the existing literature are leveraged in this area. Notably, the creativity score is the highest score amongst the range-normalized metrics. Given that each evaluates a particular dimension of creativity, a creative idea may score well on one and not on others. Thus, to identify creative ideas as opposed to cross-metric-performing ideas, only the highest score is utilized.\nBoth rubrics are created through combining human-supplied details, which are provided along with the initial tasking, and relevant queries to an LLM, based on the subject of the initial tasking."}, {"title": "3.6.

Alternatively, it could be retooled or expanded.\nRubric criteria for each application will specify when retooling versus expansion are appropriate. Generally, retooling will be called for when the generated concept is far from meeting acceptable standards while expansion will be used when the concept is close to meeting acceptable standards, but still falling short. A concept that is sent for expansion, which does not make significant progress in increasing its creativity determination score, will be sent for retooling. A concept could be sent for expansion multiple times, if each iteration of expansion produces creativity determination score enhancement (despite the requisite threshold level not being reached)."}, {"title": "3.7.

It has demonstrated the efficacy of random word seeding for creative idea generation and the use of the generated ideas for chapter concept generation. It has also demonstrated the ability of the LLM to generate rubrics for evaluating story creativity and shown how they can be utilized to increase the creativity of the LLM's output via running multiple story generation attempts and selecting the highest scoring one from this set.\nA number of key areas of the target CAIRDD system remain yet unexplored and are left as a topic for future work. Fuzzing and search expansion were not implemented during this work. This stage may also, optionally, implement a topic concept evaluation and creativity score-based filtering mechanism, depending on whether expansion of the concept result set (and required run time) is acceptable. The efficacy of creativity metric filtering on the generated concepts also remains to be assessed.\nAdditionally, the concept retooling and concept expansion steps, shown in Figure 1, have not been implemented during this work. These areas also remain to be explored. Notably, other ideas may also be implemented during this phase of the CAIRDD algorithm, such as providing the LLM with rubric-based feedback for it to implement to attempt to improve the creativity of its output.\nFinally, future work will seek to evaluate the resulting outputs of the CAIRDD system relative to human-produced materials. As there is no universally accepted standard for evaluating creativity, a key portion of this work will be to identify the appropriate standards (drawing on the discussion presented in Section 2) for doing this. This step will facilitate the evaluation of CAIRDD comparative to human performance and can consider the creativity, comparative cost of production and other factors.\nThe CAIRDD system seeks to increase the creativity of LLM outputs, facilitating their use in application areas requiring discontinuous thought and creativity. While it produces a facsimile of creativity (and the actual source of human creativity itself remains elusive), this may be suitable for many applications. Further, the creativity rubric-based evaluation and enhancement proposed herein may be able to enhance both LLM and human-produced content, including both textual content outputs and the prompts used to create other types of media."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "VEHICULAR Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are foundational to intelligent transportation systems (ITS), providing a framework for real-time vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication essential for traffic coordination and road safety [1], [2]. As the scale and complexity of VANETs increase, so do the computational and communication demands on roadside units (RSUs) and cloud platforms, which serve as critical infrastructure for processing and distributing control information [3]. To alleviate these demands and enhance VANET stability, efficient control methods that reduce reliance on extensive infrastructure are crucial for practical ITS deployment [4].\nIn VANETs, achieving network controllability where a subset of vehicles can steer the entire network to desired states-is essential for adaptive responses to dynamic traffic conditions and diverse coordination needs [5]. VANETS operate in diverse environments with varying network topologies tailored to specific communication and control demands. For instance, urban areas with dense intersections may use mesh or cluster-based topologies to handle high traffic volumes and complex road layouts, while highways might adopt chain topologies to support convoy formations. Furthermore, communication links in VANETs often exhibit asymmetric coupling, where leading vehicles influence the behavior of following vehicles, but the reverse influence is minimal or absent. In emergency scenarios, such as ambulances requesting right-of-way, asymmetric interactions become even more pronounced as critical messages broadcast without expecting reciprocal communication [6]\u2013[8]. These factors necessitate specialized control strategies to ensure network cohesion and achieve control objectives effectively.\nTo meet these challenges, achieving network-wide stability by controlling a strategically selected subset of vehicles has emerged as a promising approach, effectively reducing reliance on RSUs and cloud computing resources [9]. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, VANETs often encompass multiple task-specific networks, each with distinct objectives, such as congestion management, collision avoidance, or coordinated route planning. Vehicles that participate in multiple networks-depicted by multi-colored icons serve as overlapping nodes, introducing unique control opportunities and challenges. Leveraging these overlapping nodes within a pinning control framework can enhance control efficiency and reduce control costs, though it requires balancing the objectives of each network to prevent conflicts, particularly in safety-critical scenarios.\nFurther complicating VANET control is the diversity of vehicle types, such as private cars, buses, and freight trucks, each with distinct operational requirements [10]. For example, private cars often exhibit adaptive driving patterns, buses prioritize route consistency and passenger safety, and freight trucks frequently travel in convoys to optimize logistical efficiency. RSUs, positioned along the road, play a vital role in V2I communication by facilitating data exchange between vehicles and the cloud, which acts as a centralized platform for control and data processing. In infrastructure-limited scenarios, the deployment of a pinning control strategy becomes essential for achieving efficient, network-wide control, thereby reducing the computational load and dependency on cloud resources.\nIn autonomous driving environments, the state demands of vehicles such as speed, inter-vehicle distance, braking status, and desired trajectory-further complicate control node selection [11], [12]. Multi-colored vehicles in Fig. 1 represent those with diverse state requirements, often forming sub-networks within the larger vehicular network. Applying direct control to each vehicle through RSUs and cloud computing would impose substantial computational and communication overhead. By strategically selecting and controlling specific vehicles (pinning control nodes), state influence can propagate through overlapping nodes, promoting consensus across sub-networks and achieving efficient network-wide control.\nThis paper proposes an adaptive genetic algorithm-based pinning control framework aimed at enhancing network controllability in VANETs with asymmetric coupling and overlapping nodes. We establish a theoretical foundation for pinning control in both single and multi-network scenarios, proving the stability of the control strategy using Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Building on this analysis, we design a novel genetic algorithm to optimize the selection of control nodes, focusing on minimizing the number of nodes required while ensuring overall network stability. The proposed approach reduces computational and control load across the network, thus alleviating dependency on external infrastructure. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We conduct a comprehensive controllability analysis, establishing theoretical conditions for pinning control stability in VANETs with asymmetric coupling and overlapping nodes, thereby supporting the practical deployment of robust ITS.\n\u2022 We introduce an adaptive genetic algorithm to optimize control node selection, balancing LMI constraints and minimizing control nodes, effectively reducing control costs and infrastructure dependency.\n\u2022 We perform extensive simulations across diverse network topologies and dynamic vehicular scenarios, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed framework."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have been the subject of extensive academic inquiry due to their potential in enabling intelligent transportation systems. However, the high mobility, frequent topology changes, and complex network interactions inherent in VANETs present significant challenges for stable and efficient network control. Research has been conducted on a variety of VANET-related topics, such as communication protocols, network topology management, control strategies, and optimization techniques for control node selection [13], [14].\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the related work on VANET topologies, control methodologies, and optimization techniques for control node selection. To address these challenges, adaptive and decentralized control strategies have been proposed to maintain VANET stability and improve coordination [5], [14]\u2013[16]. Consensus-based control approaches have been extensively studied for achieving cooperative behavior among vehicles. These methods aim to synchronize the state of vehicles, such as speed and acceleration, to ensure smooth traffic flow and prevent collisions [17]. Achieving consensus in VANET environments involves various strategies such as event-triggered consensus and distributed model predictive control [13], [18], [19]. However, achieving consensus in dynamic VANET environments is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of network connectivity and the asymmetric interactions among vehicles [5], [15]. Recent research has introduced adaptive consensus protocols that consider time-varying topology changes, while others have proposed reinforcement learning-based approaches to improve consensus convergence in highly dynamic scenarios [20]-[22]. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often require the entire network to participate in control, which can be resource-intensive.\nPinning control, a specialized form of consensus control, has been introduced to reduce the control effort by applying control inputs to a selected subset of nodes [23], [24]. Pinning control has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing network controllability, particularly in large-scale multi-agent systems [25], [26]. In the context of VANETs, pinning control can help reduce resource consumption while maintaining system stability, especially in the face of dynamic topologies [25]. Existing studies have explored the impact of pinning node selection on the overall controllability and robustness of the network [14]. Furthermore, adaptive pinning strategies have been developed to adjust the control nodes in response to changes in the network topology, ensuring better resilience against link failures [27]. However, the applicability of pinning control in VANETs, particularly under real-world constraints such as high mobility and frequent disconnections, remains underexplored.\nOptimization of control node selection is another area that has received considerable attention. The concept of using leader-follower models in VANETs has been explored to minimize control efforts by selecting a subset of vehicles as leaders while ensuring that the entire system remains controllable [28]-[30]. Various methods have been employed for leader selection, including linear programming, heuristic algorithms, and metaheuristic approaches [28], [31]. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have shown promise due to their ability to handle complex, non-linear optimization problems and explore a large solution space efficiently. Recent advancements include hybrid genetic algorithms that combine GAs with other optimization techniques to improve performance [32]. Additionally, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) have been applied to leader selection problems in VANETS with promising results [29], [33], [34]. However, most existing optimization approaches do not explicitly consider the dynamic nature of VANETs, such as frequent topology changes and asymmetric coupling, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent work has begun to address these limitations by incorporating adaptive optimization frameworks that respond to changes in network conditions, ensuring more robust control performance [35], [36].\nAlthough considerable progress has been made in VANET control strategies, existing studies have not fully addressed the challenges posed by high mobility and frequent disconnections inherent in VANETs. Furthermore, issues such as asymmetric coupling between vehicle nodes and the extensive network-wide participation required by many control strategies are often overlooked [37], [38]. These limitations hinder the applicability of many control and optimization techniques in real-world VANET scenarios, where dynamic topology changes and varying network conditions are prevalent [39]-[41].\nIn this paper, we build upon these prior works by proposing an adaptive genetic algorithm for optimizing control node selection in VANETs. Unlike previous studies that focus on static topologies or simplified network conditions, our approach explicitly addresses dynamic topologies and asymmetric coupling, ensuring system controllability under realistic VANET conditions. By applying control inputs to a selected subset of nodes through pinning control, our method reduces overall control effort and resource consumption while maintaining system stability. Additionally, we perform a detailed controllability analysis to validate the effectiveness of our control strategies under the complex, dynamic conditions typical of VANETs."}, {"title": "III. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS", "content": "A. Pinning Consensus Problem in a Single Vehicular Network System\nIn this subsection, we study the pinning consensus problem in a first-order continuous-time vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) system using adaptive and pinning control strategies. We analyze the conditions necessary for system convergence and propose corresponding pinning control methods.\nConsider a continuous-time vehicular network system consisting of N vehicles. The state of each vehicle is described by physical quantities such as position and velocity. The dynamic equation for each vehicle is:\n$X_i(t) = C \\sum_{j=1}^{N} G_{ij} [x_j (t) \u2212 x_i(t)] - c d_i[x_i(t) \u2212 x^*]$, (1)\nwhere:\n\u2022 $x_i(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ represents the state vector of vehicle i at time t, including position, velocity, etc.;\n\u2022 $C > 0$ is the coupling strength that determines the influence between connected vehicles;\n\u2022 $\u0393 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ is the internal coupling matrix, satisfying \u0393 > 0 (i.\u0435., \u0393is positive definite);\n\u2022 $G_{ij}$ are the elements of the asymmetric adjacency matrix $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$, describing the communication links between vehicles;\n\u2022 $c > 0$ is the pinning control gain constant that adjusts the strength of the pinning control;\n\u2022 $d_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates whether vehicle i is pinned ($d_i = 1$);\n\u2022 $x^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ is the target consensus state to which all vehicles should converge.\nTo simplify the analysis and focus on the core aspects of pinning control, we consider the case without communication delays, i.e., $T_{ij} = 0$. The system dynamics then reduce to:\n$X_i(t) = C \\sum_{j=1}^{N} G_{ij}[x_j (t) \u2013 x_i(t)] - c d_i[x_i(t) \u2212 x^*]$. (2)\nDefine the error:\n$e_i(t) = x_i(t) - x^*, i = 1, 2, . . .,N$.

Substituting (3) into (2), we obtain:\n$\\dot{e_i}(t) = C \\sum_{j=1}^{N} G_{ij}[e_j(t) \u2013 e_i(t)] \u2013 c d_i[e_i(t)$. (4)"}, {"title": "IV. FORMULATION OF THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM", "content": "In vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), whether in a single network or a heterogeneous multi-network system, it is crucial to minimize the number of pinned vehicles while ensuring system stability. This problem is known to be NP-hard due to the combinatorial nature of selecting an optimal subset of pinning nodes. As the problem size grows, exact solutions become computationally infeasible, making heuristic optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, a practical approach to efficiently identify a minimal set of pinning nodes that can achieve system convergence.\nMinimizing the number of pinned nodes reduces the required control resources, such as computational power and communication bandwidth, resulting in more cost-effective and scalable vehicular network systems. Efficient pinning node selection ensures that the control strategy remains effective as the number of vehicles in the network increases, facilitating the deployment of large-scale vehicular applications. By optimally selecting pinning nodes, the network can maintain stability and consensus even in the presence of node failures or communication disturbances, enhancing the overall robustness and reliability of the system. Finally, the optimization framework has broad applicability in real-world vehicular scenarios, including platooning, coordinated lane changes, adaptive cruise control, and traffic management systems, where synchronized behavior is critical for safety and efficiency. This formulation aims to achieve efficient control using the minimum number of control nodes while guaranteeing the stability of the overall system."}, {"title": "V. MIXED-VARIABLE GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR PINNING CONTROL OPTIMIZATION", "content": "This section presents an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) tailored for pinning control optimization, including specific strategies for constraint handling and initialization, particularly under a heterogeneous multi-network vehicular network setup.\nTo ensure solutions meet the necessary Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints, a penalty function is incorporated within the GA, guiding the algorithm toward feasible regions. If the LMI constraint is violated, a penalty term $\\lambda\\cdot\\xi$ is added to the fitness function, where $\\lambda$ is the penalty coefficient. The penalty coefficient $\\lambda$ is dynamically adjusted throughout generations based on the infeasibility measure $\\xi$. Increasing $\\lambda$ for infeasible solutions with larger $\\xi$ encourages the population to move towards feasible regions, thus promoting convergence.\nFor the single-network case, the infeasibility measure $\\xi_s$ quantifies the deviation from the LMI constraint:\n$\\xi_s = ||2CL_s \\otimes Q + 2c\\hat{D} \\otimes Q - \\delta(I_N \\otimes I_m)||_p$,\nwhere $|| \\cdot ||_F$ is the Frobenius norm.

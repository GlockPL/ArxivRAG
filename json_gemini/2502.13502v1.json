It is composed of deep layers of decoders\nwith multi-headed Power Law Graph Attention (PLGA) [Gokden, 2021, 2019]. The deductive outputs are intended\nto observe and regularize the model, while the inductive output is the next-token prediction of a language model.\nPLGA is a series of non-linear and linear transformations that attend to an input sentence that can be considered as a\nweighted graph G = (V, E) where nodes are the tokens densely represented by an N-dimensional embedding space.\nThe PLGA learns a metric tensor ALM of the embedding space after applying a custom fully connected layer and\niSwiGLU, a positive semi-definite activation function, to the output A of a deep residual network of gated linear units\n(GLUs) whose input is a density matrix operator derived from the query. The range and strength of the interactions\nbetween each embedding dimension are determined through learned power coefficients P that define a potential tensor\nAp = AM. Finally, a superposition of these potentials define the energy-curvature tensor GLM, which represents\ninteraction of each embedding dimension with all other dimensions. The attention ELM is then derived by projecting\nthe query and key vectors on GLM.\nThe metric tensor, potential tensor and the energy-curvature tensor are the deductive outputs that were considered\nin implementation of the PLDR-LLMs [Gokden, 2024] to derive the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) loss and use\nit as a regularizer to modify model characteristics without scaling the model or dataset size. In the study that first\nintroduced the PLDR-LLMs, the focus was on the characterization of model performance with respect to scaling layer\ndepth and model size under the constraint of memory size. It was demonstrated that the PLDR-LLM has comparable"}, {"title": "2 Approach", "content": "The training approach is same as the PLDR-LLMs trained in [Gokden, 2024] and similar to the approaches for training\nfollowed in [Radford et al., 2019, Touvron et al., 2023a,b]. PLDR-LLMs are trained autoregressively while minimizing\nthe cross-entropy loss (and DAG loss of deductive outputs). We evaluated the pretrained PLDR-LLMs with learnable\nGLM through a PLGA network and with predefined GLM on benchmarks for zero-shot performance.\nThe model parameters of PLDR-LLMs pretrained are shown in table 1 along with the modified versions of PLDR-\nLLM that replaces the deep PLGA net (residual gated linear units, application of iSwiGLU, custom linear layer\nweights and biases, and learnable power coefficients) with a constant GLM for ablation studies. PLDRv51 version is\nthe Pytorch implementation of PLDRv5 design [Gokden, 2024] with unused activation and dropout layers removed\nfor simplicity. The number of embedding dimensions per head at each decoder layer was set at dk = 64. Number of\nresidual layers and number of SwiGLU and LU in each residual layer were set at 8 and 2, respectively. PLDRv51G\nversion does not have trainable PLGA net, instead uses a predefined GLM provided as a model hyperparameter during\nmodel initialization. PLDRv51Gi version also does not have PLGA net but a predefined GLM inferred from an already\ntrained PLDR-LLM of same configuration for input prompt as empty string by generating single token with greedy\nsampling. It is used only to demonstrate inference by transferring all remaining learned parameters from an already\npretrained PLDR-LLM of PLDRv51 type. For the special case where GLM is set as identity tensor, PLDRv51G\nbecomes equivalent to an LLM with SDPA.\nThe models are implemented with the option to enable KV-cache (see, for example, [Shazeer, 2019, Liu et al., 2024])\nand G-cache for faster inference. The KV-cache implementation uses the same approach used in LLMs with SDPA\nsuch as GPT and LLAMA. This is possible because GLM (ALM, A) behaves as an input invariant tensor up to a small\nperturbation during inference.\nG-cache. After processing the prompt as input, GLM is cached once. For the remaining next-token predictions, the\nneural network that outputs GLM is skipped and cached GLM tensor is used as a linear operator.\nKV-cache. For the initial prompt, the key, query and value inputs are processed and cached. The output of residual\ngated linear units A is also cached once at this step.

The regularization coefficients for deductive outputs (ALM, Ap, GLM) were (0.05, 0.05, 0.05).\nThe coefficients were not optimized for the tokenizer model through a comprehensive parameter search for the best\nbenchmark performance.\nPLDRv51-110M-2 was pretrained on the interval [16M, 32M] from the same dataset without DAG regularization.\nFor comparison, we also evaluated reference models in the literature (GPT2-124M\u00b2 [Radford et al., 2019], GPT-Neo-\n125M\u00b3 [Black et al., 2021, Gao et al., 2020] and Phytia-160M4 [Biderman et al., 2023]) in zero-shot setting with\ntheir implementation on the Huggingface platform, using EleutherAI Evaluation Harness Suite [Gao et al., 2024].\nThe benchmarks were evaluated with KV-cache and G-cache enabled and disabled for PLDR-LLMs with the same\nevaluation suite.\nTo observe characteristics of trainable and pre-defined GLM values, we ran ablation studies by training PLDR-LLMs\nin a different section of RefinedWeb dataset using first ~8B tokens from the [16M, 32M] sample interval. For char-\nacterization of a model with transfer learning of GLM, PLDRv51G-106M-1 was pretrained using a GLM learned and\ninferred from PLDRv51-110M-1 pretrained on the data interval [0, 16M]. We also pretrained models where GLM is\nidentity (PLDRv51G-106M-2), and a tensor with random values from normal distribution with unit variance and zero\nmean (PLDRv51G-106M-3) under same training parameters. PLDRv51G-106M-2 is a special case which is equiva-\nlent to an LLM with SDPA widely used in the literature. It was possible to train these models at a much lower learning\nrate of 3 \u00d7 10-4 and warm up step size of 2000.\nPLDR-LLM is sensitive to the choice of SwiGLU:LU ratios which also affect the learning rate and warm up step size.\nWe trained PLDRv51-110M-3 with a SwiGLU:LU ratio of 180:64 at a learning rate of 1 \u00d7 10-3 and warm up step\nsize of 2000. PLDRv51-110M-4 and PLDRv51-110M-5 were trained with SwiGLU:LU ratios of 181:64 and 196:64\nand a larger learning rate of 1.5 \u00d7 10-3 for comparison with the base model PLDRv51-110M-1.

The final RMSE value is calculated\nacross all decoder layers. The RMSE value when caching enabled is same as without caching up to at least 15 decimal\ndigits for most of the models for ALM, Ap, and GLM. The perturbation effect is more evident for A, however this\ndoes not reflect on the other deductive outputs derived from it. The perturbation can be modified with DAG loss as\nPLDRv51-DAG-110M shows the largest deviation with caching among the models. The RMSE of A is minimum at\n#ResL/#A = 136.91 among models with same number of decoder layers and attention heads (PLDRv51-110M-1 to\n5, PLDRv51-DAG-110M).\nThe maximum magnitude (absolute value) of determinants derived from deductive output heads are shown in table\n3 up to 15 decimal digits. The determinant of all heads for A and ALM are zero, hence these deductive outputs are\nsingular for all models trained. We see similar high degree of fidelity to the values without caching for maximum\nmagnitude of determinants of Ap and GLM. Ap and GLM typically exhibit very large determinant values on some of\nthe heads. The DAG loss regularization brings the maximum magnitude of determinants observed for Ap and GLM\nclose to zero.\nTables 2 and 3 empirically reveal that there are some common characteristics of deductive outputs among models.\nCombined with observed and a priori known characteristics of row and column values of A and ALM, we can state\nthe following:\n\u2022 A has the same set of row values for every head in each layer up to a very small perturbation in their values\namong rows and different heads within same layer. A approximates a matrix-rank 1 tensor and it is singular.\nIt has one non-zero eigenvalue which is approximately the sum of elements in its row. This real eigenvalue\nrepresents the spectral radius of A for heads at each layer.\n\u2022 ALM is guaranteed to be a positive-definite tensor for numerical stability6. Since every head is a square\nmatrix dk \u00d7 dk of positive real values, and by Perron-Frobenius theorem, they have real eigenvalues which\nare the spectral radius for each head. As observed empirically, it is also singular for each head.\nThese common characteristics indicate that PLDR-LLM learns a generalizable, non-trivial singularity condition for\nthe deductive outputs from the dataset and under this condition a portion of neural network can be replaced with an\ninvariant tensor operator up to a very small perturbation in deductive outputs.\n5.2 Benchmark Evaluation\nThe zero-shot performance of PLDR-LLMs with different model parameters is shown in table 4 with different KV-\ncache and G-cache configurations. The benchmark scores are same for all datasets with or without caching, as a\nconsequence of highly invariant, generalizable deductive output characteristics of PLDR-LLM. The benchmark scores\nare comparable to the reference models reported in literature. The negative test model evaluations show reduced scores\non average, indicating that the GLM has an actual effect on improving benchmark scores.\nTable 5 shows evaluation of benchmarks with zero-shot setting for the models with higher SwiGLU:LU ratios and their\nlearning rates/warm up step sizes adjusted for each model. All models show identical scores with and without caches\navailable. PLDRv51-110M-3 has the smallest learning rate/warm up step size configuration among all PLDRv51\nmodels with same layer size and number of attention heads, and shows the highest Avg-1 and lowest Avg-2 scores\namong these models, particularly impacted by a low TruthfulQA score.\nWe compared the inference time of PLDRv51-104M and PLDRv51-110M-1 with reference model GPT-Neo-125M\nwith KV-cache enabled in table 6. The KV-cache and G-cache improve the inference time by a factor of 3 when enabled"}, {"title": "6 Discussion", "content": "The deductive outputs were introduced in [Gokden, 2021] to demonstrate that local and global characteristics of the\nrepresentation space can be observed and investigated through them. Out of these deductive outputs, GLM (ALM)\nwere output of a network composed of deep residual and fully-connected layers and represent localized characteristics\nof a sample from the dataset as it is required to infer them. On the other hand, learnable parameters such as the power\ncoefficients, and custom weight/bias parameters represent the generalizable (and global) characteristics learned from\nthe entire dataset. Empirical observations we presented here indicating that GLM (ALM) is in fact a generalizable\nrepresentation of the dataset have important implications. If a single input sample is considered as a local variable,\nGLM is also a local but invariant variable of that local frame up to a small perturbation and differs from learned model\nweights in this aspect. PLGA was inspired at the intersection of quantization of samples through tokenization and their\ndense features in an N-dimensional embedding space, collectively representing the nodes and their feature vectors as\npart of a graph. The interactions between graph nodes are determined by potentials that shape the high-dimensional\nloss landscape similar to how mass and energy curves space-time. The effect we see here appears to be an empirical\nmanifestation of Mach's principle [Misner et al., 1973] in the embedding space and it can be stated as \"local inertial\nframes are affected by the distribution of matter and energy everywhere\". GLM is learned and modified non-linearly\nby all the samples that model is pretrained on, yet it is invariant to a high degree and a generalizable linear operator for\nthe local frame of any input sample at inference. In other words, the input variable generates GLM locally, but because\nit is invariant to all inputs up to a small perturbation, it is almost indistinguishable from a constant linear operator and\ncan be cached as such.\nThe observation that we can replace a portion of neural network with a generalizable tensor operator means that there is\na fundamental asymmetry between training and inference phases. Although the evaluation is identical during inference\nafter this replacement up to a small perturbation, it would not be possible to train a model as effective without a fully\ndefined PLGA net as it was shown in results on table 7 and figure 1. A practical application of this would be to conceal\nthe PLGA weights during inference."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "PLDR-LLM is a new type of foundational model that can learn a generalizable deductive output as an invariant tensor\noperator up to a small perturbation and this operator can replace its generating neural network at inference. This\ncharacteristic also makes it possible to use KV-cache optimizations more efficiently for faster inference by switching\nto an invariant GLM as tensor operator after inferring it with initial prompt only once. We showed that this observation\nholds for a very high degree of fidelity after caching for deductive outputs and for a variety of benchmarks with zero-\nshot setting. We also compared the model performance by transfer learning an already inferred GLM, and with\npredefined GLM equal to identity and a random tensor from a normal distribution with unit variance and zero mean.\nThe benchmark results and loss and accuracy curves show that PLDR-LLM with its full PLGA network is distinct\nand better performing than GLM with predefined values. The LLM with SDPA widely used in literature is a special\ncase of PLDR-LLM where GLM is set to identity. PLDR-LLM exhibits an asymmetry between training and inference\nphases through caching that is unique to this foundational model architecture.

During the preschool\nyears, children's ability to regulate their emotions and behaviors develops rapidly and serves as an\nimportant protective factor against externalizing problems.4,5 A primary proximal context for the\ndevelopment of children's regulation ability is the dynamic process of parent-child interaction, in which\nboth the parent and the child modulate their emotions and behaviors in response to each other's ongoing\nemotions and behaviors.6-9 Mothers providing support in response to children's negative emotions and\ndysregulated behaviors may facilitate children's self-regulation and has been found to be significantly\nassociated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems.10-12 Yet, the accuracy of predicting\nchildren's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics has not been evaluated.\nIn this study, we aimed to predict preschoolers' externalizing problems six months later using\nmaternal and child behaviors observed during a challenging puzzle game and evaluate the prediction"}, {"title": "Mother-child Interaction Dynamics and Children's Externalizing\nProblems", "content": "In coordinated parent-child mutual regulation, the parent and the child interact to fulfill the child's goals of\nmaintaining harmonious internal status and engaging with the external environment. On the one hand, the\nparent helps to repair disruptions of the child's ongoing activity, by providing support in response to the\nchild's cues of dysregulation.10,17 On the other hand, with parental support the child is able to change from a\nnegative emotional status to a more positive emotional status and to pursue goal-directed engagement with\npeople and objects. 10,18 Such a process is an opportunity for the child to practice effective regulation with\nparental support and may promote the child's self-regulation and reduce the child's externalizing problems\nin the long run.19\nRegarding implications of parent-child mutual regulation for children's externalizing problems,\nexisting studies have mainly focused on the coercive process, that is, both the parent and the child\nresponding to each other's coercive behaviors (i.e., parental intrusiveness and control, child noncompliance\nand defiance) with escalating coercion until the parent gives in, which contributes to children's conduct\nproblems.2,20 In support of the coercive process framework, mothers' negative emotions and harsh parenting\nin response to children's negative emotions and aversive behaviors have been found to predict children's\nmore externalizing problems. 21,22 To our knowledge, only one study examined the dynamics between\nparental support and children's negative affect as predictors of children's externalizing problems. This study\nfound that during a conflict discussion task, the likelihood of mothers showing supportive responses to\nchildren's negative affect and the likelihood of children transiting out of negative emotion in response to"}, {"title": "Children's Inhibitory Control and Externalizing Problems", "content": "Children's inhibitory control is a key aspect of temperament related to self-regulation,26 which develops\nrapidly during the preschool period.27-29 Children with higher inhibitory control are able to regulate their\nemotions and behaviors more consciously and flexibly, and suppress socially undesirable behaviors. 29,30\nThus, children with higher inhibitory control have been found to show lower levels of externalizing\nproblems. 14-16\nBesides the direct link between children's inhibitory control and externalizing problems, children\nwith different levels of inhibitory control may also respond to and be affected by parenting behaviors in\ndifferent ways. Children with lower inhibitory control have more difficulty regulating their emotions and\nbehaviors and may need parental support to a greater extent. In support of this hypothesis, a few studies\nfound that only for children with low inhibitory control, maternal warmth predicted fewer externalizing\nproblems,31 and maternal physical punishment and negative control predicted more externalizing\nproblems.32,33 In contrast, the findings of another study supported the goodness of fit framework. That is,\nfor children with low inhibitory control, maternal autonomy support predicted more externalizing problems"}, {"title": "Predicting Child Externalizing Problems Using RDSEM and ASBIM\nModel", "content": "The existing studies about predictors of children's externalizing problems have focused on testing whether\nthe variance of children's externalizing problems can be explained by the interested predictors, but did not\nevaluate the accuracy of prediction using certain predictors or models. The latter is of important practical\nimplications, because it helps to identify the children who are at greater risk in order to inform early\nprevention.\nOne of the latest method to model the mutual regulation process of parent-child interaction is the\nRDSEM, which is a combination of multi-level modeling and structural equation modeling for time series\nanalysis.13 In the RDSEM, at the within-person level, the association between fluctuations of maternal\nbehaviors in a given moment with fluctuations of child behaviors in the next moment (i.e., mother-to-child\nlagged association) and the association between fluctuations of child behaviors in a given moment with\nfluctuations of maternal behaviors in the next moment (i.e., child-to-mother lagged association) can be\nestimated in the same model to reflect the mutual regulation process. In addition, autoregressions between\nthe residuals of maternal and child behaviors and the covariance between maternal and child behaviors at\nthe same moment can also be modeled. At the between-person level, children's externalizing problems at\nTime 2 can be predicted using the mother-to-child and child-to-mother lagged associations, together with\nperson means of maternal and child behaviors, demographic variables and child externalizing problems at\nTime 1. Children's inhibitory control can also act as a predictor at the between-person level, but the\nRDSEM cannot estimate the interactions between inhibitory control and the latent variables of mother-to-\nchild or child-to-mother lagged associations or the interactions between inhibitory control and the person\nmeans of maternal and child behaviors.\nAlthough the mother-to-child and child-to-mother associations can be used to estimate the mutual\nregulation process in mother-child interaction, they may not be able to fully depict the complex dynamics\nof interaction. For example, the mother and the child may not only be affected by what each other did in the\nprevious moment but may also be affected by the accumulation of certain behaviors from the beginning of\nthe interaction; the mother-to-child and child-to-mother associations may not be constant throughout the\ninteraction; maternal and child behaviors at different time during the interaction may have different\nimplications for child adjustment. Thus, a more data driven approach may be able to capture the complex\ndynamics that are useful for predicting children's externalizing problems. Deep learning model could model\nthe behavior interaction at different time and extract high-order interaction features,35 enabling a more\neffective and fine-grained analysis of the behavior sequences of mother and child compared to RDSEM.\nAnother advantage of the deep learning model is that demographic variables, person means of maternal and\nchild behaviors, as well as children's inhibitory control can be included as personalized individual features,\nthus interaction between these variables and the dynamics of mother-child interaction can be taken into\nconsideration when predicting children's externalizing problems, which may further improve prediction\naccuracy.\nA few studies have begun to develop various computational tools to predict variables with\ncomplex mechanisms. 36,37 For example, Paolucci et al. (2023) used a machine learning model to distinguish\nindividuals with autism spectrum disorders from controls based on ratings for home videos of children\ndoing everyday activities.38 Yan et al. (2023) obtained a dataset of students' demographics, physical and\nmental health, peer and family relationships, bullying experience and combined two machine learning\nalgorithms to predict bullying victims.39 Waheed et al. (2020) applied Artificial Neural Networks to\nimprove the prediction accuracy of students' academic performance from a big longitudinal dataset.40 To\nour knowledge, there haven't been any studies using deep learning techniques and the dynamic data of\nparent-child interaction to predict future child developmental outcomes. Therefore, we propose the\nAttention-based Sequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model to enhance the prediction\naccuracy of children's externalizing problems. By incorporating mother and child features and analyzing\nthe mother-child interaction sequence, the ASBIM model can effectively predict the child's externalizing\nproblems."}, {"title": "As a commonly used method for evaluating prediction accuracy in machine learning and deep\nlearning, five-fold cross-validation (where k is typically set to five for small datasets) is employed in our\nwork to validate the performance of both RDSEM and our ASBIM model. Specifically, in k-fold cross-\nvalidation, the dataset is initially partitioned randomly into k distinct folds, each containing a roughly equal\nnumber of samples. Subsequently, each fold takes turns serving as the test set for the model trained on the\nremaining k-1 folds.34\nThe Current Study", "content": "In the current study, we aimed to examine the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with\nmaternal autonomy support and child defeat (i.e., expression of frustration, incapacity to complete the task\nor giving up) during a challenging puzzle task using a more theory-driven RDSEM and a more data-driven\nASBIM model. We also examined to what extent adding children's inhibitory control in the models could\nimprove prediction accuracy. Findings of this study would help to predict children's externalizing problems\nand inform early prevention."}, {"title": "Method", "content": "Participants\nThe participants were drawn from a larger study examining mother-child interaction and children's\nsocioemotional functioning during the preschool period in China (see\u2074\u00b9). Participants were recruited in\nthree preschools in a small city in Middle China in 2018. The sample size was determined referring to\nothers observational studies of the dynamic process of mother-child interaction in challenging problem-\nsolving tasks during the preschool period.23,24 A recent study using the RDSEM model reported a similar\nsample size. 42 Of the 113 families participated, 101 families (46 boys, Mage=57.41 months, SD=6.58) were\nincluded in the analyses. Reasons for exclusion were child refusing to work on or quitting the puzzle task\nwithin the first minute (n=4), child not understanding how to play the puzzle (n=1), mother did not adhere\nto task instructions (e.g., looked at child's puzzle, n=3), technical errors (n=2), and child significantly\nyounger (38 months old) or older (77 months old) than other children (n=2). In the families included, on\naverage, the mothers were 31.93 years of age (SD=3.43, Range=23-42 years) and received 14.64 years of\neducation (SD=2.48, Range=10-20 years), and the fathers were 33.18 years of age (SD=3.63, Range=23-47\nyears) and received 14.47 years of education (SD=2.44, Range=10-20 years). Annual income of the\nfamilies ranged from 10,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan (about $4,398 to $73,301), with a median of 100,000\nyuan (about $14,660). The participants excluded did not differ from those included on these demographic\nvariables or the study variables. The parents provided written consent and the children provided oral\nconsent for participation in this study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at East\nChina Normal University (protocol no. HR2-1118-2020). This study was not preregistered. Study materials\nand analysis codes are available upon request. Data of this study can be obtained at\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.21227/cyyj-7378.\nProcedure\nThis study was longitudinal with two time points, which were six months apart. At T1, the mother-child\ndyads participated in a 45-min research visit in a quiet room in the child's preschool and their interaction\nwas video recorded. At both T1 and T2 mothers and fathers reported child externalizing problems. At T1\nmothers and fathers reported child inhibitory control.\nIn this report, we focused on mother-child interaction in the puzzle tasks, which followed a 10-min\nmother-child play session. During each of the two puzzle tasks, mothers and children were presented with a\n14- piece Tangram\u00ae puzzles (i.e., dog or lion), where the level of challenge was beyond what a preschooler\nwas capable of completing independently. Mothers and children were seated across from each other at a\nchild-sized table, with a barrier positioned in the middle of the table. During one puzzle task, the barrier\nwas set low so that the mother could see her child but not the puzzle board or pieces; during the other\npuzzle task, the barrier was set high so that the mother could not see either her child or the puzzle. The\norder of the puzzle (dog, lion) and barrier type (low, high) were counterbalanced across participants. The\nchild was given the puzzle board and pieces, and the mother was given the solution to the puzzle. The\nmother and child were instructed to try and complete the puzzle in five minutes and to communicate only\nusing words. A large countdown timer was visible to both the mother and the child and signaled the end of\nthe task.\nThe puzzle tasks were designed specifically to address an objective of the larger study on maternal\nspeech prosody and children's behavioral and physiological regulation. Given the focus on mother-child\ninteraction in this report, we only examined data from the low barrier condition, where mother-child dyads\ncould use visual cues (e.g., expression, gaze, gestures) during their interaction, and we excluded\nexamination of the high barrier condition."}, {"title": "Measures", "content": "Observational Coding of Maternal and Child Behaviors\nMaternal and child behaviors during the puzzle task were rated by different teams of coders (three coders\non each team), who were Chinese undergraduate students majored in psychology. Behaviors were rated on\n4-point scales (0=not at all characteristic, 3=highly characteristic) in 15-sec intervals, and the ratings\ncaptured frequency, duration and/or intensity of behaviors.\nMaternal autonomy support reflects the degree to which the mother acted in a way that recognized\nand respected the child's individuality, motives, and perspective. This code was modified from existing\nstudies (see18,43,44). Maternal autonomy support was demonstrated through positive and engaged response to\nthe child's bids for attention or help (e.g., giving a hint or explanation when the child asks for help), interest\nin and encouragement of what the child was doing and saying (e.g., verbal acknowledgement of the child's\nstatement), provision of opportunities for the child's independence or input (e.g., asking a pedagogical\nquestion), positive acknowledgement or encouragement of the child's effort (e.g., \"Good job!\", \"Have a try.\")\nand emotional support when necessary (e.g., \"I know it is difficult. Don't worry.\"). It was difficult for\ncoders to reach acceptable levels of reliability in training due to complexity of this behavior. Thus,\nmaternal autonomy support for all dyads were double coded. Discrepancies of interval ratings greater than\none were discussed to reach consensus and other ratings were averaged between the two coders. Because\nthe two coders' ratings were averaged to get the final ratings for each interval, intraclass correlations (ICCs)\nfor averaged measures45 were calculated to assess interrater reliability (ICC=.75).\nChild defeat was captured by two codes, behavioral defeat and negative affect. Behavioral defeat\ncaptures the child's uncertainty, reluctance, or withdrawal from the task. Behavioral defeat was\ndemonstrated by (a) verbal statements indicating the child was struggling with the puzzle task (e.g., \"I\ncannot get this piece to fit!\"), giving up, or feeling a lack of confidence in one's ability to solve the puzzle\n(e.g., \"This is too hard!\") and (b) non-verbal signs indicating withdrawal from or giving up on the task (e.g.,\npushing the puzzle away). Negative affect captures the child's displays of sadness or anger, such as\nfrowning, glaring, pouting, whining, and harsh tone of voice (modified from46). For the child behaviors, the\ncoders reached acceptable levels of reliability in training. Thus, following the typical approach for\nassessing interobserver reliability, 20% of the tapes were double coded for child behaviors, and reliability\nwas assessed throughout the official coding process. For child codes, therefore, only one coder's ratings\nwere used as the final ratings, and ICCs for single measures45 were calculated to assess interrater reliability\n(ICC=.71 and .79, for behavioral defeat and negative affect, respectively). Ratings of child behavioral\ndefeat and negative affect were positively correlated at the within-person level (r=.63, 95% confidence\ninterval [.54, .70]) and were averaged in each interval to obtain scores of child defeat.\nParental Reports of Children's Externalizing Problems\nAt T1, all 101 mothers and 87 fathers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ47) and\nat T2, 95 mothers and 87 fathers completed the questionnaire. SDQ is a widely used questionnaire to assess\nchildren's behavioral adjustment. The copyrighted Chinese version for parents of 4- to 17-year-olds was\nobtained from https://www.sdqinfo.org. There is support for good reliability and convergent validity of\nSDQ in Chinese population.48 In this report, we focused on parental reports of externalizing problems (10\nitems, e.g., \"Restless, overactive, cannot stay still for long\", \"Often has temper tantrums\"). Parents rated\neach item on a 3-point scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 2 (certainly true) based on their children's\nbehaviors over the last six months, and the ratings (reverse scored when appropriate) were averaged across\nthe items. Internal reliability was acceptable to good (Cronbach a=.69-.70). Mother and father reports were\npositively correlated (r=.52 and .63, ps<.001 at T1 and T2, respectively) and averaged.\nParental Reports of Children's Inhibitory Control\nThe short form of Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ-SF49) was used to measure children's\ntemperament. Previous study showed that CBQ-SF had good internal reliability in Chinese samples.50 In\nthis report, we examined parental reports on child inhibitory control, which was measured by 6 items (e.g.,\n\"Is good at following instructions\") on a 7-point Likert scale (1=extremely untrue of your child,\n7=extremely true of your child) based on child behaviors over the last six months. If parents have not\nobserved their child reactions in certain situations, they can select the not applicable option. One item was\nreverse scored and the mean score of the six items was calculated. Internal reliability of the inhibitory\ncontrol subscale was good (Cronbach a=.79 and .74 for mother and father reports, respectively). Father-\nand mother-reported scores were significantly correlated (r=.51, p<.001) and averaged to create composite\nscores of inhibitory control."}, {"title": "Data Analytic Strategies", "content": "Data preprocessing and missing data\nScores for child defeat were heavily skewed toward 0 (0 in 78% of the intervals during mother-child\ninteraction), and these ratings were recoded into a binary variable (i.e., 0=not present, 1=present). Although\nthe frequency of child defeat was low, only 10.9% of the children did not show any defeat during the task,\nand 76.2% of the children showed two or more instances of defeat.\nIn 0.4% and 0.3% of the intervals, maternal autonomy support and child defeat were missing\nbecause the coders could not hear the mother's or the child's speech due to video quality or because the\nmother-child dyad were talking about topics irrelevant to the puzzle game. Of the 101 families included in\nthe analyses, 5 were missing parental reports of child behavioral adjustment at T2. We first fitted the\nRDSEM using the full sample to reveal the relations between the study variables. At this stage, Bayesian\nestimation was used to handle missing data. Next, we evaluated the prediction accuracy of RDSEM using\nthe five-fold cross-validation. At this stage, 10 datasets were imputed. We conducted five-fold cross-\nvalidation for each imputed dataset. Next, we examined the predication accuracy of ASBIM using five-fold\ncross-validation for each imputed dataset.\nRDSEM\nAs preliminary steps, (a) child gender, age, and maternal years of education were examined as potential\ncovariates by testing their associations with externalizing problems at T2, and (b) systematic changes in\nmaternal and child behaviors during the puzzle task were examined by testing the effect of time (i.e.,\nintervals) on maternal autonomy support and child defeat using RDSEMs. The significant covariates and\neffects were retained in the main model described next.\nIn the main model, at the within-person level, paths were estimated from maternal autonomy\nsupport in the current 15-sec interval (t) to child defeat in the next interval (t+1, i.e., mother-to-child lagged\nassociation), and from child defeat in the current 15-sec interval (t) to maternal autonomy support in the\nnext interval (t+1, i.e., child-to-mother lagged association). The covariance between maternal and child\nbehaviors within the same 15-sec interval and the autoregressive paths for residuals of maternal and child\nbehaviors were also estimated.\nAt the between-person level, the bi-directional lagged associations between maternal autonomy\nand child defeat and the person means of maternal autonomy support and child defeat during the puzzle\ntask were examined as predictors of child behavioral adjustment at T2, while controlling for child\nadjustment at T1. Variances of the bi-directional lagged associations and the autoregressive paths, and their\ncovariances with each other and with the between-person predictors were also estimated. The models were\nestimated both with and without child inhibitory control as a between-person predictor.\nThe five-fold cross-validation. We first fit the RDSEM using the full sample to reveal the relations\nbetween the study variables and then evaluated the prediction accuracy using the five-fold cross-validation.\nFor the model without child inhibitory control as a predictor, for each training dataset, the RDSEM was\nfitted to obtain estimations of the intercept for externalizing problem at T2, the coefficients of the\npredictors (i.e., the mother-to-child lagged association, the child-to-mother lagged association, the person\nmean of maternal autonomy support, the person mean of child defeat) and the coefficients of the covariates\n(i.e., child externalizing problems at T1 and child gender). For each testing dataset, a simplified RDSEM\nwas fitted to estimate the mother-to-child and child-to-mother lagged associations and person means of\nmaternal autonomy support and child defeat for each mother-child dyad. In the simplified RDSEM, only\nthe within-person effects (i.e., mother-to-child lagged association, child-to-mother lagged association,\nautoregressions of maternal and child behaviors, time effects on maternal and child behaviors), and their\ncovariances with each other, with person means of maternal and child behaviors and with child\nexternalizing problems at T1 were estimated. For each mother-child dyad in the testing dataset, the\npredicted value of children's externalizing problems at T2 was calculated using the estimated values of\nmother-to-child and child-to-mother lagged associations, person means of maternal autonomy support and\nchild defeat, the observed values of child externalizing behaviors at T1, child gender and the intercept and\ncoefficients estimated in the corresponding training dataset. The average squared difference (Mean Square\nError, MSE) and the average correlation between the predicted values and the observed values of children's\nexternalizing problems at T2 across the five testing datasets were calculated to evaluate the prediction\naccuracy. For the model with child inhibitory control as a between-person predictor, the procedure was the\nsame, except that for each training dataset the coefficient of child inhibitory control was also estimated, and\nthat for each testing dataset the observed values of child inhibitory control were also used to predict child\nexternalizing problems at T2."}, {"title": "ASBIM", "content": "Before we elaborate the details of our ASBIM model", "as": "Given\n$S_m", "types": "a categorical type with a finite set of distinct values (i.e."}, {"as": "n$\\Phi_i \\in\n\\begin{cases"}], "by": "n$p_{mc"}, "begin{cases", "n\\Phi_i[p_{mc_i", "text{the i - th individual feature is categorical type", "np_{mc_i", "times \\chi_i & \\text{the i - th individual feature is numerical type", "n\\end{cases", 2, "nwhere $\\Phi_i[p_{mc_i", "represent the $p_{mc_i", "th row of $\\phi_i$.\nFinally", "we obtain the representation of th mother and child features by a simple and efficient\naverage operation:\n$\\overline{p_{mc", "avg(p_{mc_i", 3, "nwhere $avg()$ represents the averaging operation across all input vectors.\nIn behavior interaction representation modeling module", "we adopt the representation of the mother\nand child features to obtain the personalized mother-child behavior interaction representations.

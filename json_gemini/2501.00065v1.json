Existing studies have shown that mothers providing support in response to children's dysregulation was associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems. The current study aims to evaluate and improve the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics.\nMethod: This study used mother-child interaction dynamics during a challenging puzzle task to predict children's externalizing problems six months later (N=101, 46 boys, $M_{age}$=57.41 months, SD=6.58).\nPerformance of the Residual Dynamic Structural Equation Model (RDSEM) was compared with the Attention-based Sequential Behavior Interaction Modeling (ASBIM) model, developed using the deep learning techniques.\nResults: The RDSEM revealed that children whose mothers provided more autonomy support after increases of child defeat had lower levels of externalizing problems. Five-fold cross-validation showed that the RDSEM had good prediction accuracy. The ASBIM model further improved prediction accuracy, especially after including child inhibitory control as a personalized individual feature.\nConclusions: The dynamic process of mother-child interaction provides important information for predicting children's externalizing problems, especially maternal autonomy supportive response to child defeat. The deep learning model is a useful tool to further improve prediction accuracy.\nKeywords: parent-child interaction, autonomy support, externalizing problems, deep learning model", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Preschoolers with symptoms of externalizing problems, such as aggression, oppositional behaviors, attention deficits, and hyperactivity, are at risk of a cascading process in which early symptoms sustain and contribute to negative developmental outcomes in the long run, such as poor social relationships, substance use, and unemployment.1-3 Thus, it is important to identify the children who are likely to develop high levels of externalizing problems and provide prevention accordingly from early on. During the preschool years, children's ability to regulate their emotions and behaviors develops rapidly and serves as an important protective factor against externalizing problems.4,5 A primary proximal context for the development of children's regulation ability is the dynamic process of parent-child interaction, in which both the parent and the child modulate their emotions and behaviors in response to each other's ongoing emotions and behaviors.6-9 Mothers providing support in response to children's negative emotions and dysregulated behaviors may facilitate children's self-regulation and has been found to be significantly associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems.10-12 Yet, the accuracy of predicting children's externalizing problems with mother-child interaction dynamics has not been evaluated.\nIn this study, we aimed to predict preschoolers' externalizing problems six months later using maternal and child behaviors observed during a challenging puzzle game and evaluate the prediction"}, {"title": "Mother-child Interaction Dynamics and Children's Externalizing Problems", "content": "In coordinated parent-child mutual regulation, the parent and the child interact to fulfill the child's goals of maintaining harmonious internal status and engaging with the external environment. On the one hand, the parent helps to repair disruptions of the child's ongoing activity, by providing support in response to the child's cues of dysregulation.10,17 On the other hand, with parental support the child is able to change from a negative emotional status to a more positive emotional status and to pursue goal-directed engagement with people and objects. 10,18 Such a process is an opportunity for the child to practice effective regulation with parental support and may promote the child's self-regulation and reduce the child's externalizing problems in the long run.19\nRegarding implications of parent-child mutual regulation for children's externalizing problems, existing studies have mainly focused on the coercive process, that is, both the parent and the child responding to each other's coercive behaviors (i.e., parental intrusiveness and control, child noncompliance and defiance) with escalating coercion until the parent gives in, which contributes to children's conduct problems.2,20 In support of the coercive process framework, mothers' negative emotions and harsh parenting in response to children's negative emotions and aversive behaviors have been found to predict children's more externalizing problems. 21,22 To our knowledge, only one study examined the dynamics between parental support and children's negative affect as predictors of children's externalizing problems. This study found that during a conflict discussion task, the likelihood of mothers showing supportive responses to children's negative affect and the likelihood of children transiting out of negative emotion in response to"}, {"title": "Children's Inhibitory Control and Externalizing Problems", "content": "Children's inhibitory control is a key aspect of temperament related to self-regulation,26 which develops rapidly during the preschool period.27-29 Children with higher inhibitory control are able to regulate their emotions and behaviors more consciously and flexibly, and suppress socially undesirable behaviors. 29,30 Thus, children with higher inhibitory control have been found to show lower levels of externalizing problems. 14-16\nBesides the direct link between children's inhibitory control and externalizing problems, children with different levels of inhibitory control may also respond to and be affected by parenting behaviors in different ways. Children with lower inhibitory control have more difficulty regulating their emotions and behaviors and may need parental support to a greater extent. In support of this hypothesis, a few studies found that only for children with low inhibitory control, maternal warmth predicted fewer externalizing problems,31 and maternal physical punishment and negative control predicted more externalizing problems.32,33 In contrast, the findings of another study supported the goodness of fit framework. That is, for children with low inhibitory control, maternal autonomy support predicted more externalizing problems"}, {"title": "Predicting Child Externalizing Problems Using RDSEM and ASBIM Model", "content": "The existing studies about predictors of children's externalizing problems have focused on testing whether the variance of children's externalizing problems can be explained by the interested predictors, but did not evaluate the accuracy of prediction using certain predictors or models. The latter is of important practical implications, because it helps to identify the children who are at greater risk in order to inform early prevention.\nOne of the latest method to model the mutual regulation process of parent-child interaction is the RDSEM, which is a combination of multi-level modeling and structural equation modeling for time series analysis.13 In the RDSEM, at the within-person level, the association between fluctuations of maternal behaviors in a given moment with fluctuations of child behaviors in the next moment (i.e., mother-to-child lagged association) and the association between fluctuations of child behaviors in a given moment with fluctuations of maternal behaviors in the next moment (i.e., child-to-mother lagged association) can be estimated in the same model to reflect the mutual regulation process. In addition, autoregressions between the residuals of maternal and child behaviors and the covariance between maternal and child behaviors at the same moment can also be modeled. At the between-person level, children's externalizing problems at Time 2 can be predicted using the mother-to-child and child-to-mother lagged associations, together with person means of maternal and child behaviors, demographic variables and child externalizing problems at Time 1. Children's inhibitory control can also act as a predictor at the between-person level, but the RDSEM cannot estimate the interactions between inhibitory control and the latent variables of mother-to- child or child-to-mother lagged associations or the interactions between inhibitory control and the person means of maternal and child behaviors."}, {"title": "ASBIM", "content": "Before we elaborate the details of our ASBIM model, we give the formalization first. Concretely, for maternal $m \\in M$ and child $c \\in C$, $S^m={s^{m_1}, s^{m_2}, ..., s^{m_n}}$ and $S^c={s^{c_1}, s^{c_2}, ..., s^{c_n}}$ represent the behavior sequence of maternal $m$ and child $c$, while $s^{m_i}$ and $s^{c_i}$ stand for the autonomy support of maternal $m$ and the defeat of child $c$ in the i-th 15-sec interval respectively. In addition, maternal $m$ and child $c$ have the same length of the behavior sequence, while $n$ denotes the length of the behavior sequence. Besides, $g^c$ represents the gender of child $c$. In addition, $e^{c_{T1}}$ and $e^{c_{T2}}$ denote the externalizing problems of child $c$ at T1 and T2 respectively. Then, the regression task of children' externalizing problems prediction is defined as: Given $S^m, S^c, g^c$, and $e^{c_{T1}}$, we want to predict $e^{c_{T2}}$.\nFigure 1 depicts the whole framework of our ASBIM model, which includes four modules. Concretely, in individual feature modeling module, ASBIM model acquires the embedding vectors of mother and child features for modeling the behavior representations of mother and child in a personalized manner subsequently. Then, in behavior interaction representation modeling module, ASBIM model generates the mother-child behavior interaction representations based on the individual feature representations. After that, in behavior interaction pattern modeling module, ASBIM model extracts the mother-child behavior interaction pattern from the corresponding sequence of behavior interaction representations. Finally, in prediction module, ASBIM model adopts the mother-child behavior interaction pattern to predict the child's externalizing problem at T2.\nSpecifically, in individual feature modeling module, we adopt look-up embedding technique51 to obtain the embedding vectors of mother and child features. To be specific, the individual features utilized in this module not only include the gender of child $c$ and the externalizing problems of child $c$ at T1 but also incorporate the person mean of maternal $m$'s autonomy support and child $c$'s defeat. By including these personalized features, our ASBIM model can account for unique interaction patterns between each mother and child, thereby enabling a more accurate and personalized understanding the child's"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Descriptive statistics for the study variables at the between-person level (i.e., person means of maternal autonomy support and child defeat at T1, child externalizing problems at T1 and T2, child inhibitory control at T1), their bivariate correlations (between-person correlations are below the diagonal and within- person correlations are above the diagonal), and ICCs (i.e., the proportion of between-person variance in total variance) of maternal autonomy support and child defeat are presented in Table 1. The ICCs show that both maternal autonomy support and child defeat varied more within each mother-child dyad than between different families. Each mother's mean levels of autonomy support throughout the puzzle task was not correlated with their children's mean levels of defeat throughout the task, or children's externalizing problems at T1 and T2. Yet, at the moment when the child expressed more defeat, the mother showed more autonomy support, indicating the importance to examine interaction dynamics within each mother-child dyad. On average, children with higher inhibitory control expressed less defeat throughout the task, and showed fewer externalizing problems at T1 and T2. Children's externalizing problems at T1 and T2 was positively correlated showing steability of children's externalizing problems across six months."}, {"title": "RDSEM", "content": "Preliminary analyses showed that boys had higher levels of externalizing problems at T2 than girls (t=2.27, p=.025). Thus, child gender was included as a covariate in the main model.

At the within-person level, higher maternal autonomy support at t predicted higher child defeat at t+1. Child defeat at t did not significantly predict maternal autonomy support at t+1. In addition, maternal autonomy support was positively associated with child defeat in the same interval. Autoregressive effects emerged for both maternal autonomy support and child defeat.\nAt the between-person level, the moment-to-moment lagged association from child defeat to maternal autonomy support during the puzzle task at T1 negatively predicted child externalizing problems at T2, above and beyond child externalizing problems at T1. That is, if the mother provided more autonomy support after the child showed more defeat during the puzzle task, this child had lower levels of externalizing problems six months later. The lagged association from maternal autonomy support to child defeat and the person means of maternal autonomy support and child defeat throughout the puzzle task did not significantly predict children's externalizing problems at T2.

As shown in Figure 3, the y for both models consistently exceeds 0.5 in all 10 imputed datasets.

Existing studies have shown that mothers providing support in response to children's negative emotions and dysregulated behaviors was associated with children's lower levels of externalizing problems.10-12 Nevertheless, these studies focused on explaining the associations in the observed data, rather than examining the accuracy of prediction. In the current study, we examined the moment-to-moment fluctuations of maternal autonomy support and child defeat during a challenging puzzle task and to what extent children's externalizing problems six months later can be accurately predicted with these data. We examined prediction accuracy using five-fold cross-validation and compared the performance of a more theory-driven RDSEM and a more data-driven ASBIM model. We also examined whether including child inhibitory control in these models could further improve prediction accuracy. The results showed that in the RDSEM, for children whose mother displayed higher autonomy support after children expressed more defeat, these children had lower levels of externalizing problems six months later. Prediction accuracy of the RDSEM was good, with small MSEs and moderate correlations between the predicted values and the observed values of children's externalizing problems six months later. Prediction accuracy of the ASBIM model was higher than that of the RDSEM, especially after including children's inhibitory control in the model. Below we discuss the findings in more detail.\nIn consistent with previous studies, 10-12 we found that the lagged association between child defeat and maternal autonomy support predicted lower levels of children's externalizing problems six months later, after controlling for children's gender, their current levels of externalizing problems and the overall levels of maternal autonomy support and child defeat during the task. That is, for children whose mother provides higher autonomy support after children expressed higher defeat, they showed lower externalizing problems in the future. Mothers providing more autonomy support (e.g., asking questions to figure out the child's need, giving helpful instructions or tips, and providing encouragement) after children expressed defeat may provide children with helpful information regarding how to handle the challenging situation and the opportunity to practice self-regulation in a proactive way (see19). Such a parenting practice may facilitate children's internalization of regulatory skills helpful for reducing externalizing behaviors. Although it was posited that autonomy may be relatively less emphasized in collectivistic cultures,55,56 in line with previous studies showing cultural similarity in the positive implications of maternal autonomy support for adolescents' emotional well-being,43,57 we found that in a Chinese sample, mothers providing more autonomy support in response to more child defeat may be a protective factor against preschoolers' externalizing problems. This finding also corresponds with the results of ASBIM models showing that"}]}

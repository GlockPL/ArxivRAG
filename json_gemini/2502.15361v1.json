However, when bias is mixed within the reasoning process to form strong logical arguments, it could cause even more harmful results and further induce hallucinations. In this paper, we have evaluated the 8B and 32B variants of DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) against their instruction tuned counterparts on the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022), and investigated the bias that is elicited out and being amplified through reasoning steps. To the best of our knowledge, this empirical study is the first to assess bias issues in LLM reasoning.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) prompting strategies significantly enhance their reasoning abilities by encouraging multi-step problem-solving (Chu et al., 2024). In particular, DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025) has shown that the reasoning capabilities of larger models can be effectively distilled into smaller pre-trained models, enabling them to outperform their counterparts trained solely through instruction tuning on math and coding tasks. Moreover, reasoning models exhibit emergent skills such as self-reflection (Renze and Guven, 2024), allowing them to conduct in-context searches to solve complex reasoning problems.\nExisting works (Liu et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2024; Hwang et al., 2024) have predominantly focused on investigating reasoning capabilities in math and coding domain due to their inherently logical nature enables verifiable performance metrics. But, this focus has left critical knowledge gaps in assessing social fairness within reasoning-based LLMs. In the era of LLMs, social bias evaluation has expanded to areas such as question answering (Ma et al., 2024), search (Fang et al., 2024), ranking (Wang et al., 2024a), vision-language models (VLMs) (Wu et al., 2024), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (Wu et al., 2025), and other domains that leverage LLMs. Thus, there remains a significant gap in understanding how reasoning patterns interact with demographic variables, and whether enhanced reasoning mechanisms inherently mitigate social biases. On the other hand, some studies have identified issues such as \"Underthinking\" (Wang et al., 2025) and \"Superficial Self-Reflection\" (Liu et al., 2025) in the context of math problem solving. In these cases, LLMs frequently switch between reasoning steps, generating unnecessary thought processes that sometimes lead to incorrect answers. Notably, phenomena observed in math domains may have amplified societal impacts when applied to bias-sensitive scenarios. As illustrated in Figure 1, frequent reasoning path shifts in thought processes or superficial self-reflection can reinforce social stereotypes in reasoning steps, leading to biased outputs. Thus, a systematic analysis of how demographic factors influence both the reasoning processes and their outcomes is crucial.\nIn this empirical study, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning-based models and their base counterparts. Utilizing the BBQ benchmark framework, we perform a dual-aspect analysis of model reasoning processes and outputs, incorporating accuracy metrics and bias quantification. Our findings reveal a pronounced amplification of societal biases in erroneous model responses. Using the LLM-as-a-judge methodology proposed by (Kumar et al., 2024) for granular reasoning step evaluation, our results show that mentions of social stereotypes occur significantly more frequently in the reasoning patterns of incorrect responses. Notably, traces of stereotypical reasoning persist even in correct answers, though at a significantly lower frequency. Furthermore, our analysis systematically connects stereotype-free reasoning patterns and improved model performance. These results highlight a strong correlation between flawed reasoning trajectories and heightened bias expression, providing novel empirical insights into the societal and ethical risks of reasoning-based LLMs. The contribution of this work are two folds: 1) To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate social biases in reasoning-based LLMs by extending bias assessment beyond final predictions to include the reasoning steps themselves. 2) Our experiments show that while reasoning-based models improve accuracy, they do not mitigate biases, in many cases, they actually amplify stereotypes, particularly in ambiguous contexts."}, {"title": "2 Evaluation Framework", "content": "Our evaluation framework as shown in Figure 2. The outputs are rigorously evaluated using dual criteria: prediction accuracy and bias quantification (via predefined metrics), while reasoning quality is assessed through an LLM-as-judge methodology. Furthermore, by contrasting stereotype-free reasoning templates with default model behaviors, this study quantifies the causal impact of implicit biases on prediction reliability.\n2.1 Datasets\nWe utilize the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022) to evaluate the bias in model outcome and reasoning steps. The BBQ dataset includes nine broad categories of known social biases, along with two intersectional categories, all sourced from (U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2021). In each category, each example consists of either an ambiguous or a disambiguated context, specifies a protected and an unprotected group, and presents a question with three answer choices: the protected group, the unprotected group, and \u201cunknown\u201d. The statistics of BBQ dataset are shown in Table 1.\n2.2 Prompt and Reasoning-based Model Inference\nWhile prompting methods remain effective for evaluating LLMs (Liu et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2024b; Wu et al., 2024), we observe significant sensitivity of model predictions to variations in prompts. To ensure methodological rigor, we design customized prompts for each reasoning-"}, {"title": "2.3 Outcome Evaluation", "content": "Building upon the methodological foundations of the BBQ benchmark and 03-mini system card specifications (OpenAI, 2025a), we examine outcome evaluation through a dual-metric system: Accuracy (Acc) and Bias Score (Bias). Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions in ambiguous/disambiguous scenarios through exact pattern matching against ground-truth labels, using regular expressions for response normalization, denote as Accamb and Accdis respectively.\nAcc = \\frac{Ncorrect}{Ntotal} (1)\nWith Acc \u2208 [0, 1], where higher values indicate superior task alignment. For bias score, we quantify the percent of non-UNKNOWN outputs align with a social bias, which a model systematically answers questions in a biased manner. This is done separately for ambiguous and disambiguated contexts, denoted as Biasamb and Biasdis, respectively (OpenAI, 2025a; Parrish et al., 2022).\nBiasamb = \\frac{Nnon-stereo}{Namb,not-unk} (2)\nwhere where Nnon-stereo denote the Number of non-stereotyping responses in ambiguous, not-unknown cases, Namb,not-unk denote Total number of ambiguous, not-unknown cases. Biasamb\u2208 [0, 1], higher values is better, indicates that answers go against the bias.\nBiasdis = 2 * \\frac{Nnon-stereo}{Ndisamb,not-unk} - 1 (3)\nWith Biasdis \u2208 [-1,1], where bias score of 0 means no bias detected, 1 indicates full alignment with the target bias, and -1 signifies complete opposition."}, {"title": "2.4 Reasoning Step Evaluation", "content": "DeepSeek-R1 based models output reasoning steps by default within the <think>...</think> tag, where each reasoning step is separated by the new-line character. To analyze bias in reasoning steps, we leverage LLMs as cost-effective judges for bias assessment, circumventing the labor-intensive protocols of human annotation. This approach aligns with prior work demonstrating LLMs' capacity to approximate human evaluations (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Following (Kumar et al., 2024), we employ a LLM-as-a-judge method using GPT-4o to assign scores ranging from 0 to 4 to each reasoning steps for their bias severity. For the exact prompt of our LLM-as-a-judge method, please refer to Figure 7 for more details."}, {"title": "2.5 Stereotype-free Reasoning Pattern", "content": "To investigate whether there is correlation between biased reasoning steps and incorrect outcomes, we propose \u201cStereotype-free Reasoning"}, {"title": "3 Experiments", "content": "3.1 Experimental Settings\nWe primarily focus on evaluating the outcomes and reasoning steps of various LLMs using specific prompts under a zero-shot setting without finetuning. During generation, we adhere to the same generation parameters as specified in each model's system card. All experiments are conducted using NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\nEvaluated Models We evaluate DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B\u00b9 and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B2 which are distilled from Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-32B (Team, 2024) respectively. We also evaluate their instruction tuned counterparts: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\u00b3 (Dubey et al., 2024) and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct\u2074. Marco-015 (Zhao et al., 2024), fine-tuned on Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) using reasoning paths from MCTS"}, {"title": "3.2 Overall Outcome Evaluation", "content": "Table 2 presents detailed per-category results for each model under different contextual conditions (ambiguous vs. disambiguated) on the BBQ dataset. Table 3 summarizes the aggregated evaluation metrics, computed by averaging performance across categories and contextual conditions. Additional per-category results for each model under various contextual conditions are provided in Appendix A.2.\nModels While reasoning-augmented models improve accuracy, our analysis finds no corresponding reduction in bias. For instance, In Table 2, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B consistently outperforms similar-sized models on model prediction accuracy in all categories-achieving success in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts (11 out of 11 categories). Yet, it still exhibits similar or even worse bias scores in certain areas (9 out of 11 categories for ambiguous questions and 5 out of 11 categories for disambiguated ones). Moreover, even when the number of model parameters is increased, as seen with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforming Qwen2.5-32B in accuracy, the bias levels remain unmitigated. These findings suggest that while explicit reasoning traces can enhance performance, they do not inherently guarantee fairness. A similar trend is observed among closed-source models; for example in Table 3, OpenAI's ol model shows greater bias susceptibility than GPT-4o despite having comparable reasoning capabilities. This highlights the systemic challenges in aligning advanced reasoning processes with fairness objectives and underscores the need for more comprehensive strategies to address bias.\nAmbiguous vs. Disambiguated In disambiguated contexts, reasoning-based models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 variants) outperform their base counterparts on accuracy, across all categories. A similar trend appears in closed-source models, where GPT-4o lags behind specialized reasoning architectures. However, in ambiguous contexts, the advantage of reasoning-based models diminishes, particularly in categories like Age, Physical Appearance, Social-Economic Status (SES), and Nationality. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B fails to consistently outperform enhanced base models, and similarly, reasoning-based 01, 01-mini and 03-mini underperforms compared to GPT-40, with performance gaps widening under ambiguity. We hypothesize that ambiguity increases uncertainty, leading models to over-rely on stereotype-laden reasoning during the inference, amplifying biases in socially sensitive categories. These findings highlight the dual role of reasoning capabilities during social bias evaluation: while they enhance performance in well-defined scenarios, they may also exacerbate bias propagation when contextual ambiguity interacts with latent stereotypical associations."}, {"title": "3.3 Reasoning Step Bias Distribution", "content": "In Figure 3, we conduct a case study on the \"Age\" subset to test our hypothesis that biased reasoning steps lead to biased and wrong answers. We chose \"Age\" because DeepSeek models perform worst it's ambiguous questions. We analyze two sets of examples (1) cases where both DeepSeek and its instruction-tuned counterpart provide correct answers (green) and (2) cases where DeepSeek is incorrect while the instruction-tuned model is correct (in red). We observe two key trends: (1) Incorrect answers are associated with a bias distribution shift towards 2, while correct answers spikes at 0. (2) Incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer in reasoning steps. This pattern also appears at the token level, consistent with the findings of (Wang et al., 2025). These trends are consistent across 8B and 32B models, solidifying the correlation between biased reasoning and wrong answers.\nFor incorrect answers, the model often starts unbiased (bias score 0) by reiterating the context, but may later lean towards social stereotypes and lead to biased conclusions (Figure 1). Correct responses may also contain 1-2 biased steps. Manual review shows cases where the model acknowledges bias, rejects it, and refocuses on the context."}, {"title": "3.4 Stereotype-free Reasoning Pattern", "content": "After rating the bias in DeepSeek's reasoning steps using LLM-as-judge method, we perform a comparative analysis based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B. In this analysis, we compare the prediction accuracy when using biased reasoning generate from DeepSeek R1 (\u201cw/ Bias\") versus the accuracy achieved after removing stereotype bias (\"wo/ Bias\"). The test example from four test cases, Case 1 (comparing Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct under conditions where DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B fails but Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct originally succeeds), Case 2 (comparing Qwen2.5-32B when DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B fails but Qwen2.5-32B originally succeeds), Case 3 (comparing Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct under conditions where both DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct originally fail), Case 4 (comparing Qwen2.5-32B when both DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Qwen2.5-32B fail).\nIn Figure 4, we examine these four scenarios, comparing different base and DeepSeek-R1 versions of the Llama and Qwen models under \"biased\u201d versus \u201cStereotype-free\u201d reasoning. Cases 1 and 2 highlight situations where the base model fails but the upgraded model originally succeeds, while Cases 3 and 4 address situations where both the base and the upgraded models initially fail. Across all four cases, removing biased elements from a model's chain-of-thought (\"wo/ Bias\") consistently boosts predictive accuracy. Specifically, in Cases 1 and 2, accuracy rises by 0.5167 and 0.7167, respectively, following de-biasing; and in Cases 3 and 4, even though both models begin with failing prediction, accuracy still improves by 0.1000 and 0.5259, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of mitigating stereotypical reasoning for achieving more accurate model predictions, additional details of these experiments results can be found in Appendix A.3."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "Our findings highlight the risk and opportunity in reasoning-based LLMs. While automatically generating chain-of-thought reasoning enhances LLMs' performance on structured tasks like math and coding, it can also propagate social biases in open-ended reasoning. This study solidifies this finding, and our future work will focus on developing bias mitigation techniques and more accurate automated bias detection methods for reasoning-based LLMs. Addressing this challenge is critical to ensuring that LLMs reason fairly and ethically across diverse demographic groups.\nLimitations\nThe LLM-as-a-judge method, while supported by prior work, may still introduce uncertainty. We did not conduct human labeling to verify its reliability due to the extreme high cost of manual annotation. Our mitigation method is aimed to be exploratory and intuitive, without consideration for cost-efficiency or the logical flow of reasoning. A promising direction in mitigating the fairness issue in reasoning-based LLMs is fairness-aware reinforcement learning, where generation confidence can serve as an evaluation metric or reward signal. Models should progressively reduce their confidence in generating biased responses over time. Moreover, due to computational constraints, we were unable to conduct experiments on the full-size DeepSeek-R1 model, and the distilled versions may carry inherent biases."}, {"title": "A Appendix", "content": "A.1 Prompts\nA.1.1 Outcome evaluation prompt for instruction tuned models and Marco-01\nYou will receive an input in JSON format, containing:\nA context describing a situation.\nA question related to the context.\nSeveral possible answers (e.g., \u201cans0,\u201d \u201cans1,\u201d \u201cans2,\u201d etc.).\nYour task:\nInterpret the context carefully, noting any relevant details.\nIdentify if the question can be answered directly from the context or if it's ambiguous (i.e., \u201cNot enough information\u201d).\nCritically assess each provided answer choice.\nProvide your final answer by selecting the best matching answer choice.\nOutput your your final answer in the format described below.\nResponse Format:\nFinal Answer: Output exactly one of the provided answers (e.g., \u201cans0,\u201d \u201cans1,\u201d \u201cans2,\u201d etc.) that you deem correct.\n\"context\": {context},\n\"question\": {question},\n\"ans0\": {ans0},\n\"ans1\": {ans1},\n\"ans2\": {ans2}\n}\nA.1.2 Outcome evaluation prompt for DeepSeek models\ncontext: {context}\nquestion: {question}\nans0: {ans0}\nans1: {ans1}\nans2: {ans2}\nBased on the context, question and options.

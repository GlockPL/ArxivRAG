INTRODUCTION", "content": "The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G wireless communication is transforming the landscape of self-driving technology allowing vehicles to skillfully maneuver through complex and constantly shifting surroundings. Autonomous vehicle technology, being a high-stakes application, demands exceptional robustness and safety. Any failure in these systems could endanger lives and the environment, underscoring the importance of dependable and secure deployment in real-world scenarios [16].\nNavigating real-world environments through direct learning is both costly and risky. Typically, AI agents are first trained in carefully crafted virtual settings before facing actual conditions, a process known as \"simulation-to-reality transfer.\" This is necessary due to the unpredictable nature of the real world, with random interactions and rare weather or lighting conditions. Building a perfectly accurate, high-fidelity training environment is computationally prohibitive and impractical. The inevitable divergence between simulated scenarios and real-world applications, referred to as the \"reality discrepancy\" (RD), often leads to a decline in the agent's performance during actual deployment [17]. One effective strategy to bridge this gap is domain randomization, which involves exposing Al to a wide array of training environments with varied parameters. This enhances the agent's adaptability to diverse and changing real-world conditions [18]. However, despite its effectiveness, domain randomization does not guarantee complete reliability.\nEnsuring an agent's transferability is crucial, but equally important is the challenge of guaranteeing its safety in real-world applications. This difficulty is intensified by the reality gap, where rare but vital scenarios such as sudden obstacles or difficult-to-detect actors are often absent in simulations"}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "1. End-to-End Learning in Real-World Applications\nRecent advancements in robot learning highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of end-to-end learning in physical environments. Visual Foresight, a video prediction model developed by Ebert et al. [1], enables robots to plan actions by predicting future frames, effective for short tasks but computationally demanding. A deep visual foresight model for planning robot motion was introduced [2], reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance. Unsupervised learning for physical interactions via video prediction was demonstrated [3]. Latent dynamics were learned from images with SOLAR, succeeding in robotic tasks [4]. Dexterous manipulation through a learned dynamics model, explored [5], illustrates the potential of model-based methods in complex tasks.\n2. Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\nModel-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) leverages learned environmental models for decision-making and policy optimization, offering higher sample efficiency and reduced real-world data needs compared to model-free approaches. An adversarial framework generates safety-critical scenarios for LiDAR-based autonomous systems [6]. KING introduces challenging driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator [7]. The success of MBRL hinges on the model's fidelity, with Lyapunov functions providing high-probability safety assurances of stability. Reinforcement learning's adaptability combined with MPC's safety constraints showcases the potential of this approach [5]. A safe MBRL approach integrates an uncertainty-aware reachability certificate [10]. Dynamic adjustments of learning rates and exploration strategies enhance performance [9]. The importance of hyperparameter optimization in MBRL for real-world applications is emphasized [8].\n3. Sim2Real Transfer\nBridging the sim2real gap while ensuring generalizability has been a focus of recent studies. A reinforcement learning framework for autonomous driving was introduced, integrating traditional modular pipelines with end-to-end approaches and validated in real-world scenarios [12]. Robustness across domains was enhanced using a CNN-LSTM network, complemented by data augmentation [11]. Bi-directional domain adaptation was proposed to bridge vision and dynamic domain gaps [13]. A framework for lane-changing decisions was presented using domain randomization [15]. An Intervention-Based Invariant Transfer Learning approach was introduced, combining domain randomization with data augmentation [16]. Blockchain integration in autonomous systems was discussed to enhance knowledge accumulation and sim-to-real transitions [14]. Despite these advancements, further investigation is needed to quantify generalization performance and ensure safety in rare scenarios."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The Navigation Secure framework utilizes a world model to simulate forthcoming states and actions, allowing the autonomous agent to predict and navigate through intricate driving scenarios securely. The world model is educated using data obtained from actual driving scenarios and highly accurate simulations, guaranteeing a thorough comprehension of various driving circumstances. This feature improves the agent's capacity to anticipate the results of actions prior to their implementation, which is essential for making well-informed choices in ever-changing settings.\nIn mathematical terms, the world model is formally defined as:\n$(t+1), (t+1), \u0108(t+1) = M(St,at)$ (1)\nwhere $(t+1)$ represents the expected next state, $(t+1)$ denotes the anticipated reward, and \u0108(t+1) signifies the potential cost or risk associated with action at taken from state St. The world model employs a sophisticated neural network to predict environmental changes by focusing on forecasting future representations rather than future inputs. This strategy minimizes error accumulation and enables efficient training using parallel processing with substantial batch sizes. Consequently, the world model acts as a fast simulator of the environment, allowing the robot to autonomously improve its model and accuracy as it explores the real world.\nIt collects and stores snapshots of robotic interactions from various scenarios, using these experiences to refine decision policies and improve network performance over time. This buffer allows the network to learn from past interactions, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to new challenges, ultimately enhancing the safety and efficiency of the autonomous system."}, {"title": "3.1. Model Architecture and Navigation Secure Algorithm", "content": "The global model utilizes a sophisticated neural network to forecast changes in the environment. Considering that sensory inputs can encompass extensive visual data, our approach involves forecasting future representations rather than future inputs. This strategy minimizes the accumulation of mistakes and facilitates very efficient training using parallel processing with a substantial batch size. Therefore, the world model functions as a fast simulator of the environment, enabling the robot to independently enhance its model from the beginning and consistently enhance its precision as it explores the actual world. The world model is constructed using the Recurrent State-Space Model, which comprises four main components. Firstly, the encoder network encodes the current state, previous state, previous action, and sensory input into a latent space representation. Secondly, the dynamics network predicts the next state by utilizing the current latent space representation and action. Thirdly, the decoder network reconstructs the sensory inputs from the latent space representation, which aids in representation learning and allows humans to inspect the model's predictions. Lastly, the reward network predicts the immediate reward based on the latent space representation of the next state.\nThe Navigation Secure algorithm emphasizes accurate action prediction. The hidden layer state ht captures all previous observations and actions and, combined with the latent state Z(t-1), predicts future actions and states within the latent space. By internally evaluating potential outcomes, the model reduces the need for practical investigation in unpredictable environments, thus enhancing learning safety and effectiveness."}, {"title": "3.2. Actor-Critic Learning Approach", "content": "The actor-critic learning method optimizes task rewards. The actor network learns a probability distribution for each hidden model state to optimize future expected task rewards, while the critic network uses temporal difference learning to predict cumulative future task rewards, enabling long-term strategic learning. The learning process is mathematically represented as:\n$\\Delta \\theta \\propto \\alpha \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\nabla_{\\theta}log \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t| s_t) \\sum_{k=t}^{T} \\gamma^{k-t}(r_k - V(s_t))$ (2)\nwhere y is the discount factor. By integrating these elements, the actor-critic algorithm effectively learns task-specific behaviors, enabling robust and efficient learning suitable for complex environments."}, {"title": "3.3. Optimization and Loss Functions", "content": "The optimization of the Navigation Secure framework relies on dynamically adjusting the parameters to enhance the accuracy of state transition and reward predictions. At the core of this process is a comprehensive loss function that integrates several components to guide the model's learning trajectory:\n$J(\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} V_{1}D_{KL} (X_k || h(X_{kt})) + V_{2}D_{KL} (X_k || h(X_{kt}) - \\lambda_{1}logP_{\\theta}(Y_k|X_k) - \\lambda_{2}logQ_{\\theta}(Z_k|X_k) - \\lambda_{3}logR_{\\theta}(W_k|X_k) + \\eta H (\\pi_{\\theta}( \\cdot |\\alpha_k))$ (3)\nThis loss function includes regularization loss, future prediction loss, observation loss, reward loss, and cost loss. Additionally, an entropy loss is incorporated to promote exploration and prevent premature convergence to suboptimal policies. The gradient stopping operation, denoted as sg(*), is used to stabilize the learning process by halting the backpropagation of certain gradients. Furthermore, the latent state can be decoded back into RGB images using the decoder, allowing the model to visually verify the accuracy of its state Zt representations. By comparing the decoder's output with real-world observations, the model generates error signals that refine its learning process, thereby enhancing its predictive capabilities for complex and dynamic environments."}, {"title": "IV. WORLD MODEL-BASED SAFE RL AND SIM-TO-REAL TRANSITION", "content": "Within the framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDP), our objective is to identify an optimal policy that maximizes expected returns while adhering to predefined constraints. This is formalized as:\n$ s = arg max g_{r}(s') $\n$s'\\epsilon C$\nHere, gr (s') denotes the return function associated with policy s, and C represents the space of all policies that satisfy the constraints. We enhance our model's predictive power by expanding the base transition probability to incorporate the World Model, an adaptation that enables the simulation of action outcomes and aids in a more detailed policy optimization process while managing potential risks. This strategic use of the World Model as both a predictive and evaluative tool facilitates the development of safer and more reliable policies in complex environments. Furthermore, this approach allows us to understand and simulate various scenarios virtually and apply these insights in real-world settings. By training in simulated environments that closely mimic real-life conditions, our systems can learn to navigate and operate effectively when deployed in actual environments. The crucial transition from simulation to reality is facilitated by the robustness and accuracy of the World Model, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical strategies and their practical implementation."}, {"title": "V.

Evaluation Metrics", "content": "To comprehensively assess the performance of the Navigation Secure algorithm in various driving scenarios, four key metrics were used. Meters Per Intervention (MPI) measures the distance the vehicle travels between two manual interventions. A higher MPI indicates that the vehicle can travel further without requiring human intervention, demonstrating higher autonomy and stability of the system. Travel Time (TT) evaluates the total time taken for the vehicle to travel from the starting point to the endpoint. Shorter travel times indicate that the vehicle can complete the journey more efficiently, making TT an important metric for assessing vehicle efficiency. Success Rate (SR) represents the percentage of the journey completed without any interventions. A higher success rate indicates that the vehicle can navigate longer distances autonomously, reducing the need for manual intervention, and reflecting the system's performance and reliability. Standard Deviation of Speed (Std[v]) measures the consistency of the vehicle's speed variations during travel. A lower standard deviation indicates more stable driving speed, leading to a smoother driving experience. These four evaluation metrics collectively provide reliable data to comprehensively assess the performance of the Navigation Secure algorithm and help compare different algorithms' performance in autonomous driving tasks."}, {"title": "5.2.

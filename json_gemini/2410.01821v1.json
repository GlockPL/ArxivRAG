The VIVO ontology [17] represents researchers and the full context\nin which they are working, including their outputs, interests, accomplishments,\nand associated institutions. The ontology was created for the VIVO software and\nintegrates a number of existing standards and ontologies, such as BFO, Dublin\nCore13, the Event ontology14 and FOAF15. VIVO represents researchers and\ntheir work extensively, but also in a rather complex and fine grained manner.\nIn contrast, this paper presents an approach in which heterogeneous research\ndomains are integrated in a BFO-compliant mid-level ontology while domain\nspecific requirements are modeled by means of modular extensions. The DCAT\nvocabulary16 enables publishers to describe datasets and data services in a cat-\nalog on the Web. The goal is to ensure discoverability, enable a decentralized\napproach to publishing data catalogs and providing the possibility for feder-\nated search for datasets across catalogs in multiple sites. The Core Data Set for\nResearch (KDSF)17 represents research information for the German academic\nsystem with the goal to harmonize and standardize the research reporting sys-\ntem at universities and research institutions.

The following points outline the key lessons learned, which have\nshaped the motivation and design of NFDIcore 2.0:\nInitial Scope of the Ontology. The development of the first version of the\nNFDIcore ontology was based solely on the data at hand, primarily focusing\non contribution descriptions and metadata about resources such as data por-\ntals, datasets, and services contributed to the NFDI4Culture project, which was\namong the first NFDI projects to start. The ontology was developed following a\nbottom-up approach, which facilitated a lightweight design. However, the lack of\ndata and limited collaboration in the initial project phase resulted in an ontology\nthat did not account for the broader needs of the culture community or poten-\ntial future requirements from other NFDI project communities, like materials\nscience or data science.\nUser Engagement and Feedback Collection. There was a lack of early and\ncontinuous engagement with the community to understand their specific needs\nand expectations. This resulted in a disconnect between the ontology's design\nand the community's expectations, and led to resistance in using the ontology\nand changing established practices in favour of usability and interoperability.\nFoundational vs Lightweight. The prioritization of a lightweight represen-\ntation in the initial versions of the ontology hindered an effective integration\nfor domains requiring rigorous representations of complex relationships and pro-\ncesses. For example, NFDICore 1.0 was able to only capture the basic fact of\ndataset creation by an agent (<:Dataset :creator :Agent>), while, for re-\nsearchers in the domain of materials science it is essential to describe not only\nthe creation itself but also the inputs, methodologies, experimental conditions,\nand outputs of the creation process."}, {"title": "3.2 Methodology and Design", "content": "The NFDI programme is overall funding 26 consortia from all scientific disci-\nplines. The creation of NFDIcore began with NFDI4Culture, a consortium from\nthe first of three funding rounds. In the initial phase of NFDI4Culture, the\nfoundation of the ontology was established based on the contribution descrip-\ntions - metadata about research resources provided by data contributors during\nthe proposal phase. The development of the NFDIcore ontology is guided by a\nbottom-up, iterative approach, adhering to user-centered design principles. This\nwas enriched through collaboration with culture domain experts, resulting in the\ncreation of user stories 18. These user stories were formulated through a series\nof meetings and practical workshops, ensuring that the ontology was shaped by\nreal-world needs and scenarios."}, {"title": "3.3 Usability and Shortcuts", "content": "By leveraging processes and roles, NFDIcore 2.0 enables a detailed representa-\ntion of how different entities interact and relate to one another over time. This is\nbeneficial for documenting research workflows, collaborations, and contributions\nwithin research projects, ensuring that the multifaceted nature of research activ-\nities is captured accurately and precisely. This enhances the ontology's level of\nexpressivity and supports a more comprehensive data integration and analysis.\nHowever, to address the community's requirements for easier integration, espe-\ncially for those who do not use complex relations in their representations and\nprefer straightforward lightweight approaches, and to ensure that NFDIcore 2.0\nremains compatible with NFDIcore 1.0, where no complex relations were used,\nNFDIcore 2.0 offers a set of SWRL rule-based shortcuts. This approach benefits\nusers by simplifying the ontology, making it more accessible and easier to imple-\nment, thus encouraging broader adoption.

So far, three modules\n(cf. Figure 5) have been released and connected with NFDIcore, with further\nmodules currently in preparation. The NFDI4Culture Ontology (CTO)30 is a\nmodule designed to represent and categorize resources within the NFDI4Culture\ndomain, which encompasses five academic disciplines: Architecture, Musicology,\nArt History, Media Science, and the Performing Arts. CTO defines classes and re-\nlations that address domain-specific research questions, connect diverse cultural\nentities, and facilitate the efficient organization, retrieval, and analysis of cultural\ndata [7]. The MatWerk ontology (MWO)31 serves as the backbone for the mate-\nrials science and engineering knowledge graph (MSE-KG). The graph focuses on"}, {"title": "4 NFDIcore Evaluation", "content": "The starting point of evaluating NFDIcore was the collection of detailed user sto-\nries that describe specific tasks, challenges, and requirements related to research\nand data management. The use cases were provided by domain experts across\nfour NFDI consortia: NFDI-MatWerk, NFDI4Culture, NFDI4DataScience, and\nNFDI4Memory. The user stories were analyzed to develop a set of concrete com-\npetency questions (CQs), which were to be expressed in SPARQL queries for the\nontology evaluation. During the preparation process, each use case was reviewed\nto identify the core requirements and objectives.\nThe collected use cases often address specific domain questions, reflecting the\nunique needs and terminologies of each research area. However, similarities are\nidentified across every consortium. For example, domain experts across all disci-\nplines ask for services: in NFDI4Culture, services for creating digital inventories\nof art collections; in NFDI-MatWerk, services for storing and evaluating raw\nmechanical test data; and so forth. Thus, for evaluating NFDIcore, this specific\ndomain information was omitted to create a set of more generalized CQs fitting\nacross consortia. For example, from a use case where a musicologist searches to\nlearn more about music notation standards such as MEI by contacting a respon-\nsible person, the essential requirements were translated into more generalized\nCQs: What standards are there for specific resource types? Who is a contact\npoint for the standards? This approach ensures that the ontology remains flex-\nible and applicable across diverse research domains without being restricted by\nthe domain-specific peculiarities of each consortium.\nOverall, there are 98 CQs collected across consortia. The analysis of the CQs\nreveals several recurring concepts that are of main interest across the different\nconsortia:"}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Conclusions", "content": "The development and evaluation of NFDIcore 2.0 provide valuable insights into\nrepresenting and integrating heterogeneous research domains. NFDIcore 2.0 ad-\ndresses these complexities by exploiting the foundational ontology BFO, ensuring\na universal representation of core concepts (RQ1). By incorporating established\nstandards and external ontologies like schema.org and DCTERMS, NFDIcore 2.0\nfacilitates effective data integration across research domains (RQ2). Moreover,\nNFDIcore 2.0 adopts a modular approach to ontology design, allowing for the de-\nvelopment of domain-specific ontology modules. This enables each consortium to\nextend the core ontology to meet the specific needs pf their domain (RQ3). \u041c\u0430\u0440-\nping NFDIcore to BFO and BFO-compliant ontologies enriches NFDIcore 2.0\nwith complex relations, processes, and roles. It enhances the ontology's expres-\nsivity and usability through detailed representation of entities and their interac-\ntions, supports comprehensive data integration and analysis, reducing ontology's\nambiguity. However, such complexity can pose challenges in ensuring consistency\nand interoperability across domains, when aligning it with external standards or\nontologies existing in different disciplines. Additionally, while a detailed model\nprovides richer semantics, their use may also become challenging for less expe-\nrienced users (RQ4). The incorporation of shortcut relations aims at addressing\nthis challenge by allowing for integrating data that lack complex representa-\ntions. The set of SWRL rules that translate complex structures into lightweight\nrelations ensures that both detailed and simplified knowledge representations\ncoexist, facilitating better reasoning about, querying and interconnection of re-\nsearch data (RQ5).\nIn conclusion, the evolution of NFDIcore 1.0 to NFDIcore 2.0 demon-\nstrates significant progress in addressing the challenges of representing and\nintegrating heterogeneous research domains. By adopting foundational ontolo-\ngies, integrating external standards and vocabularies, and enabling modular\nextensions, NFDIcore ensures a comprehensive representation, interoperability,\nand usability across various research disciplines. NFDIcore remains an ongoing\ndevelopment that will be refined and extended as more consortia are adapting\nthe ontology. NFDIcore is a step towards interconnected research, set to offer\nnew perspectives, interpretations, and visions on existing data, as well as to\nfoster greater collaboration, novel discoveries and innovations in science and\nbeyond."}]}

This lack of robust clinical guidelines has contributed to persistently poor prognosis for patients with RGTs.\u00b2\nTechnological advancements in cancer diagnostics have enabled the identification of biomarkers as therapeutic targets. Biomarker-guided treatments promise to accelerate the development of precision therapeutics across tumor types, reducing the relevance of organ-based classification.\u00b3 The prevailing organ-centric approach to clinical trial design hinders the development of effective treatments for rare cancers with shared biomarkers. This obstacle extends beyond rare cancers: The premature dismissal of olaparib in ovarian cancer and the seven to ten year delay in addressing Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressing breast and gynecological cancers with PD-L1 inhibition illustrate the need for biomarker-driven stratification for cancer treatment.5,6\nMolecular tumor boards (MTBs) are essential for interpreting biomarker profile results and matching cancer patients with appropriate therapies. This includes identifying suitable investigational drugs.\u201d The manual interpretation of multiple, co-occurring molecular alterations requires an in-depth understanding of their functional implications and correlations with treatment sensitivity or resistance. The rapid growth of biomedical literature and the fragmented nature of data sources make manual curation a bottleneck in efficiently translating genomic data into actionable treatment strategies.\u2077\nThe data produced by MTBs is often stored in unstructured formats within electronic health records (EHRs) or other repositories, hindering their reusability for similar patients. Evaluating the effectiveness of MTB-guided treatments requires extracting follow-up data from EHRs. Unstructured text within EHRs, coupled with the lack of interoperability across healthcare institutions \u2013 particularly when MTB patients receive treatment at external facilities \u2013 renders the process labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming. Consequently, applying MTB insights to future patients is hindered.\nAdvances in data capture and analysis, alongside decreasing costs in genome sequencing, are paving the way for innovative tools to manage rare or refractory cancers more effectively. Digital twin technology constructs virtual representations of physical entities with dynamic, bidirectional interfaces. Initially applied in industrial engineering, digital twins can also represent the human body in healthcare. By modeling physiological processes and predicting biomarker-specific responses to treatments, digital twins can address the challenges of patient variability and the limitations of traditional one-size-fits-all approaches. In the case of RGT, the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel regimen, followed by chemotherapy monotreatments for subsequent lines, may not be the most effective approach. \u00b9\u00b2 Digital twins could help stratify RGT patients based on their unique biomarker profiles, enabling more tailored treatments and potentially improving outcomes, even in heavily pretreated cases.\nDespite their potential, the adoption of digital twins in clinical practice is constrained by the challenges associated with integrating the diverse and complex data required for their development. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential to assist in this process by efficiently extracting and synthesizing relevant information from diverse sources.\nIn this study, we demonstrate the application of an LLM-enabled workflow for constructing digital twins for patients with RGT, specifically metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS).\nThe research question was inspired by a real-world UCS case presented to a major German cancer center for evaluation of third-line treatment options. According to a consensus statement by Bogani et al., third-line monotherapy in UCS typically results in a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 1.8 months and a response rate of 5.5%, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. The patient presented with a proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) carcinosarcoma with intermediate Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) and high PD-L1 expression. Although PD-L1 positivity is common in UCS15,16 and has been suggested as an independent prognostic factor, it has not been validated as a target for immunotherapy.\u00b9\u00b2"}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "2.1 Study setup\nWe employed an RGT Digital Twin system to create personalized treatment suggestions for UCS. A real-world patient case, along with molecular profiling data, was analyzed using the RGT Digital Twin system. The findings were then compared to analogous cases drawn from institutional and public databases. Treatment options were discussed at the MTB to inform individualized care decisions. Post-treatment outcomes were documented in the patient's EHR and updated for the individual RGT Digital Twin to improve future predictions. The RGT Digital Twin provided rationale for cost coverage requests and supported study inclusion decisions. Refer to Figure 1 for an overview of the study process.\n2.2 Patient description and research question\nThe patient is a 77-year-old woman with metastatic UCS, initially diagnosed with FIGO IIIC2 UCS at age 66. Six years after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, the patient experienced a recurrence in the cervical lymph nodes and pelvis. A cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed the recurrence, and the patient underwent the same chemotherapy regimen followed by MTB presentation in 2021 (see Supplementary Table 1 for detailed results). Genomic profiling was conducted using the TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO 500) and TruSight Tumor 170 (TST 170) panels. By analyzing a wide range of cancer-related genes, these panels facilitate the discovery of potential therapeutic targets. Molecular profiling revealed an intermediate TMB of 6.3 mutations/megabase, high PD-L1 expression (Combined Positive Score, CPS: 41), and a pMMR status. The patient's high PD-L1 expression prompted us to investigate the potential efficacy of PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic tumors, regardless of primary tumor site or regional drug approval status. To this end, we searched our institutional MTB database for analogous cases, not restricted to gynecological cancers, and expanded our cohort with additional UCS cases identified in the literature.\n2.3 Data collection\nEHR data obtained from Technical University of Munich (TUM) University Hospital was the primary data source. Data downloaded from web-based repositories through institutional access extended the dataset. These repositories included PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and clinical practice guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the German Cancer Society (DKG), which ensured adherence to up-to-date clinical standards.\nA two-stage approach was employed for extracting structured, actionable data from source files. First, a locally deployed LLM system extracted relevant data from institutional EHRs. Second, a cloud-based LLM system processed documents from web-based repositories. Afterwards, the extracted structured dataset was made available to clinicians and the locally deployed LLM for further analysis. This process is shown in Figure 2.\n2.4 Identification of analogous institutional cases\nAnalysis of the institutional MTB database at the TUM University Hospital identified cases analogous to the presented UCS patient. The analysis included patients discussed at the MTB between September 2017 and July 2024.

Documents varied in format, from (handwritten) medical notes to obituaries. Ten attributes were extracted from documents for each patient to form the RGT Digital Twin. Supplementary Table 2 shows the full list of attributes. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) was performed using Tesseract. Raw text was processed with a locally deployed version of pre-trained LLM gemma-2-27b-it, chosen for its ability to run locally while maintaining strong performance on medical texts. This privacy-preserving architecture ensured that patient data would not leave the local clinic environment. In-context learning was used to adapt the LLM to the task at hand. With this method, LLMs receive extensive instructions in their prompt, e.g., in the form of example input and output. This improves their recall and precision. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of TUM (Reference No. 2023-486-S-SB)."}, {"title": "2.6 Literature extraction pipeline", "content": "To extend the limited sample of analogous digital twins available in institutional EHR, a systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed using the terms 'uterine carcinosarcoma' and 'endometrial carcinosarcoma'. Studies and case reports that included individual clinical follow-up data on patients with UCS treated with ICI were considered for inclusion in the analysis. Potential alternative treatment options and therapeutic targets were identified through a comprehensive review of national (DKG) and international (NCCN) oncological guidelines, PubMed-indexed publications, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov database.\nData points were extracted in the structure shown in Supplementary Table 2. The sample size was captured as an additional data point. Additionally, the LLM was instructed to extract the main treatment recommendation based on the patient profile in the paper. General purpose LLM Google-Gemini-1.5-Pro was selected for this task due to its large context window, which enabled it to process all files in the sample without splitting them into smaller chunks. Since no institutional patient data was processed in this step, use of public cloud resources was permitted. The LLM was instructed to return results in the form of a JSON object. The LLM processed all documents sequentially, with each document processed in-context. Outputs were exported to a Pandas dataframe on the local machine in the secure hospital environment for convenient analysis by clinicians."}, {"title": "2.7 Construction of LLM-Enabled Digital Twin System", "content": "Next, extracted data points were stored in a database in the secure hospital environment that constituted the patient's digital twin. Clinicians were able to model potential outcomes for their patients and determine suitable treatment strategies by reviewing treatment outcomes from patients with similar biomarkers and treatment history. Additionally, they were able to employ the local LLM to combine treatment strategies identified from web sources with the patient's digital twin, creating personalized treatment recommendations. After selecting a treatment strategy, the database served as evidence for MTB evaluation, clinical trial matching, and creation of cost coverage requests with health insurance providers.\nThe developed pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"title": "2.8 Analysis", "content": "Clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, duration of therapy, treatment responses, PFS, and overall survival (OS) were systematically collected from patient records and reports.

For additional treatment strategies, outcomes were summarized for each therapeutic approach."}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "3.1 Patient cohort\nA retrospective analysis of 1821 cases discussed at the institutional MTB between September 2017 and July 2024 was conducted. Among these, 132 cases exhibited high PD-L1 expression (CPS \u226540), encompassing 28 different tumor entities. The analysis was restricted to patients with TMB <15 mutations/megabase and pMMR status with either gynecological cancers or carcinosarcoma/sarcomatoid carcinoma, resulting in a cohort of nine patients. Of these, seven patients received ICI therapy and were included in the study. The cohort comprised six females and one male aged 32 to 83 years at MTB presentation. Given that the similarity analysis focused on biomarker profiles and cancer morphology, the male patient's inclusion was appropriate. His sarcomatoid carcinoma aligned with the other inclusion criteria, regardless of his gender or cancer type.\n3.2 Data extraction\n89 EHR documents were extracted for the patient cohort (median: 11, range: 9-21). Documents had a median of two pages and 4,340 characters. Documents contained 70 data points for the selected attributes. Experts reviewed all extractions in the sample. The local LLM achieved accuracy of 0.76, precision of 0.96, recall of 0.78 and F1 of 0.86. The highest accuracy was achieved for 'diagnosis' and 'ICI treatment' (1.00). Low recall occurred in 'previous treatment' (0.29) and 'PFS' (0.14), mainly due to parsing errors in order and dates of previous treatments. See Table 2 for full results of the analysis.\nDocument analysis revealed that primary tumor sites included metastatic UCS (n=1), metastatic cervical cancer (n=4; three squamous cell carcinoma, one adenocarcinoma), metastatic uterine serous carcinoma (n=1), and metastatic, undifferentiated sarcomatoid carcinoma of the pancreas (n=1). Patients exhibited high PD-L1 expression with a median CPS of 75 (range: 40-95) and a median TMB of 5.5 (range: 0-11). Median follow-up duration was 48 months (range: 15-132 months). Detailed baseline clinical characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 3.\nThe LLM-based systematic literature research yielded a dataset of 663 scientific documents. Files had a median of seven pages and 27,995 characters, with a maximum of 934,513 characters. The LLM extracted 7,956 attributes from scientific documents. Attribute extraction was reviewed with a random sample of n = 352 (Z = 1.96, N = 7,956, e = 0.05, P = 0.5). The cloud-based LLM achieved accuracy of 0.98, precision of 1.00, recall of 0.97, and F1 of 0.98. Lowest recall was observed in 'PFS' (0.77).\nThe LLM system identified 15 studies reporting ICI treatment in UCS, encompassing a total of 215 patients. While seven of the studies did not exclusively enroll UCS patients, four provided stratified outcomes for UCS cases. Phase II studies that provided stratified analysis for UCS patients showed objective response rates between zero and ten percent for ICI treatment. None of the seven studies allowed for individual patient-level data extraction to create digital twins (see details on these seven studies in Supplementary Table 4)."}, {"title": "3.3 Treatment response outcomes for 21 individual patients", "content": "In the institutional cohort, seven patients received ICI therapy: five with pembrolizumab monotherapy, one with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, and one with ipilimumab plus nivolumab. ICI therapy was initiated on average in the third line (range: 2-4). Median PFS was 6 months (range: 1-48). One patient remained disease-free after 45 months, two continued to respond, one received a subsequent treatment line, and three had died.\nTreatments in the 14 cases of the literature-derived cohort consisted of pembrolizumab (n=4), pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (n=7), pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib plus letrozole (n=1), PD-1/Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 inhibitors (n=1), and avelumab plus axitinib (n=1). ICI was typically given in the third line (range: 2-5). Median PFS was 4 months (range: 0.9-15), and median OS was 9.9 months (range: 2.1-48). At data cut-off, six patients were alive, seven had died, and one had unknown status.\nTable 2 provides a summary of ICI treatment response outcomes for all 21 cases."}, {"title": "3.4 RGT Digital Twins enable predictive modeling of individualized patient treatment strategies", "content": "To inform personalized treatment planning for the UCS patient (case 1), digital twins were created based on 21 evaluable patients. Treatment outcomes were predicted based on a database of additional 404,265 cases derived from scientific papers (n = 655). Potential treatment strategies were predicted for a patient with UCS with disease progression following third-line pembrolizumab monotherapy.\nSupplementary Figure 1 presents treatment-relevant biomarkers after progression on standard-of-care combination treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel identified by the digital twin system.\nThe digital twin system tailored treatment recommendations based on the patient's specific tumor characteristics, treatment history, and geographic location. Considering the patient's ongoing pembrolizumab therapy, the system suggested testing for Folate Receptor Alpha (FRa) to assess potential eligibility for an off-label treatment regimen currently under clinical investigation. This trial investigated the combination of mirvetuximab soravtansine and pembrolizumab in FRa-positive UCS, with eligibility criteria including pMMR status and prior pembrolizumab progression. However, the trial was no longer recruiting participants and was limited to the United States. Therefore, the digital twin system suggested considering off-label use of this regimen for the patient. A previous evaluation (2021) identified HER2 amplification in the patient's tumor, a biomarker linked to high objective response rates to trastuzumab deruxtecan. Due to the potential for HER2 status to evolve, the system recommended confirming this finding through a new biopsy. Additionally, the digital twin system suggested evaluating Melanoma-Associated Antigen A4 (MAGE-A4) and Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME), biomarkers frequently expressed in UCS. Ongoing research explores targeted therapies for these markers. Three relevant clinical trials were accessible within the patient's geographic area. To monitor disease progression, the system recommended continued tracking of serum Cancer Antigen-125 (CA-125) levels based on its established correlation with disease progression identified in the patient's 2021 EHR data.30\nPotential treatment trajectories for treatment line four derived from the Digital Twin pipeline are demonstrated in Table 3."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Extracting meaningful data from unstructured medical text is a prerequisite for precision medicine. In this study, we implemented an LLM-based extraction pipeline to systematically retrieve, structure, and analyze data from real- world EHRs and online sources to support and evaluate diagnostic and targeted therapeutic strategies for constructing patient-specific digital twins for metastatic UCS.\nThe LLM-based extraction pipeline facilitated timely and accurate synthesis of all relevant full-text scientific publications available through institutional access up to August 15, 2024. The cloud-based LLM achieved accuracy of 0.98 on a complex corpus of medical literature, close to the 0.96 observed by other researchers. This enabled the generation of evidence-based recommendations and predictive insights grounded in the latest research. Key gaps were observed in extraction of complex data structures, with recall of 'PFS' (0.77) and 'OS' (0.95) below the overall recall of 0.97. This was due to the fragmented and unstructured way of reporting PFS and OS. Sentences such as \"Patient survived for 14 months with the residual tumor post-relapse,\" make it challenging to accurately determine PFS, as it requires estimation based on prior treatments and the number of treatment cycles. However, estimated PFS may not be accurate if treatment cycles were prolonged. This highlights the challenge of extracting precise outcome data when the primary source lacks comprehensive reporting. We strongly advocate for standards in reporting treatment outcomes, e.g., by clearly stating PFS in months and not date ranges.\nIn institutional data, unstructured EHR impeded the extraction of key clinical information. This limitation delayed the integration of institutional patient data for informing the management of similar cases. Phase II trials neglecting biomarker-stratification in patients with UCS yielded low objective response rates to ICI therapy, ranging from only zero to ten percent. For our UCS patient, this bottleneck might have precluded ICIs based on high PD-L1 expression, despite the fact that pembrolizumab proved highly efficacious with no adverse effects in this patient. The local LLM system was able to extract structured follow-up data from EHRs across a diverse and complex set of medical documents. While it achieved lower accuracy than the cloud-based model at 0.76, this is in line with the performance of similar models on complex EHR. Notably, recall was high across most attributes, with the most critical gap noted in 'biomarkers' at 0.57. The LLM achieved full recall for all biomarkers given as examples for in-context learning, but did not recognize biomarkers that were not explicitly mentioned (e.g., BRAF for case four). The LLM again achieved lowest recall for 'PFS' at 0.14. This is due to the highly unstructured and fragmented way of reporting PFS, often across multiple documents.\nThe European Society for Medical Oncology Precision Medicine Working Group recently established criteria for evaluating the tumor-agnostic potential of molecularly guided therapies, mandating an ORR of \u226520% in at least one of five patients across at least four investigated tumor types, with a minimum of five evaluable patients per type. Our institutional MTB database identified six analogous cases involving four additional tumor types, most of which exhibited durable responses to ICIs. While the limited number of evaluable patients per tumor type in our single-institution cohort restricted the statistical power, an LLM-driven literature review highlighted an underreporting of PD-L1 expression in UCS in studies conducted to date, despite the known high prevalence of PD-L1 positivity in this malignancy. This underreporting impeded our ability to assess the predictive value of PD-L1 to guide ICI treatment in UCS. Despite the limited sample size of our institutional cohort, the promising outcomes observed suggest that targeting PD-L1 expression in RGT may be a viable therapeutic strategy. The inclusion of diverse tumor types in our institutional cohort further strengthens the role of PD-L1 inhibition in both gynecological and non-gynecological cancers, making it a potential tumor-agnostic marker. Combining PD-1 blockade with bispecific antibodies could offer a promising approach for treating tumors that have not responded to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.\nTo inform treatment strategies in the event of disease progression, we constructed 21 individualized digital twins, including 7 from our institutional database and 14 from the literature, and queried an LLM-derived database contain- ing 404,265 patient cases. Although our systematic PubMed search was specifically limited to the terms \"uterine carcinosarcoma\" and \"endometrial carcinosarcoma,\" the resulting sample also included other uterine and ovarian malignancies. This is because UCS is frequently reported within the broader context of clinical trials involving more common gynecologic cancers.\nThe RGT digital twin system generated individualized trajectory predictions for various targeted therapies within a secure local environment that respects patient data privacy, offering guidance on further diagnostics, potential treatment options and continued treatment monitoring with serum CA-125. Additionally, since our real-world cohort comprised only White patients, being able to extract data on patients of other races from a vast corpus of literature helped us validate the generalizability of our treatment recommendations.\nThis study successfully demonstrated the utility of RGT digital twins for individualized treatment prediction and response modeling. The digital twin not only provided generalized recommendations for additional diagnostic testing but also incorporated specific clinical details from the patient's treatment history \u2013 such as prior pembrolizumab administration \u2013 to refine eligibility assessments for targeted therapies. The extraction and analysis of follow-up data revealed that, following the MTB recommendation, the patient received pembrolizumab due to high PD-L1 expression and exhibited a sustained partial response for over 30 months.\nThis study had several limitations. Firstly, despite a large dataset, the combination of stringent similarity criteria, a limited institutional cohort, and underreported PD-L1 status in published UCS cases prevented us from stratifying patients by PD-L1 status. Efficacy of ICI treatment in PD-L1-positive UCS remains uncertain, and current trials lack PD-L1 as a stratification factor. Bogani et al. listed nine clinical trials currently exploring ICI treatment in UCS, many of which are nearing completion. None of these trials included PD-L1 expression as a stratification factor. Our findings could inform the design of future trials that specifically evaluate ICI efficacy in PMMR UCS with high PD-L1 expression and low to intermediate TMB. Secondly, only somatic biomarkers were included, potentially underestimating"}, {"title": "Additional information", "content": "Ethics statement\nPatients from the institutional MTB were included in a clinical registry that allowed for retrospective analyses of clinical and molecular anonymized data in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

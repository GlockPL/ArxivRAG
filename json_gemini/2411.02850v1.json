{"title": "WASHtsApp \u2013 A RAG-powered WhatsApp Chatbot for supporting rural African clean water access, sanitation and hygiene", "authors": ["Simon KLOKER", "Alex Cedric LUYIMA", "Matthew BAZANYA"], "abstract": "This paper introduces WASHtsApp, a WhatsApp-based chatbot designed to educate rural African communities on clean water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) principles. WASHtsApp leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to address the limitations of previous approaches with limited reach or missing contextualization. The paper details the development process, employing Design Science Research Methodology. The evaluation consisted of two phases: content validation by four WASH experts and community validation by potential users. Content validation confirmed WASHtsApp's ability to provide accurate and relevant WASH-related information. Community validation indicated high user acceptance and perceived usefulness of the chatbot. The paper concludes by discussing the potential for further development, including incorporating local languages and user data analysis for targeted interventions. It also proposes future research cycles focused on wider deployment and leveraging user data for educational purposes.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "According to the United Nations' sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6), all people are entitled to access clean, safe, and affordable water, as well as basic sanitation, including latrines and waste collection [1]. Better sanitation and water management can boost a country's economic growth and reduce poverty. This is particularly important in low-to-lower-middle-income countries like Uganda, where unsafe water sources and poor sanitation contribute to an estimated one million deaths globally every year [2].\nThe current National Population and Housing Census 2024 in Uganda displayed part of this problem. 7% of the households in Uganda do not have toilets, in some areas up to 60%. 50% have only \u201cunimproved sanitation facilities\u201d. 19% of the households do not have access to clean water and almost 48% still collect their water from public taps or boreholes. While this is already an improvement to the past, the exposure to water borne diseases is still high and causes significant risk to individual health and overall economic growth.\nTo address this crisis, health education, which involves a combination of learning experiences based on sound theories, can empower individuals, groups, and communities to make informed health decisions [3]. Such education can come via digital media. A study in Tanzania found that even media access itself is positively correlated to WASH practices [4]. In recent years, chatbots became an increasingly used tool of \u201cdigital media\u201d for such health-related educational tasks. During COVID-19, over 61 such chatbots emerged in 30 countries to provide advice, conduct risk assessments, and educate while maintaining social distancing [5]. However, most of these chatbots, including those in healthcare overall,"}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": "WASHtsApp is developed following Design Science Research Methodology, according to Vaishanavi & Kuechler (2004) [17]. This paper details our initial Design Science Circle focused on developing a prototype artifact. Section 7 outlines the overall goal and kernel theory of the Design Science research project. To ensure relevance, we assess whether the proposed technology design can (1) provide high-quality answers to WASH-related questions and (2) be perceived as useful by the target user group. To achieve this, we employ a rigor two-step validation process: First the validation of the content and second the validation of the technology acceptance.\nTo validate the chatbot's content, we sourced questions related to WASH principles from the internet. We focused on job interview questions for prospective WASH Officers, assuming that questions people would ask the app would be similar to those they would ask persons knowledgeable in clean water, sanitation and hygiene matters in rural African areas. We also incorporated a questionnaire assessing general WASH knowledge in rural Indian settings. Overall, we merged five sources (four regarding WASH officer interview questions and the other mentioned), removed duplicates or quasi-duplicates and questions that are not related to WASH specifically\u00b9. Also, we excluded clearly irrelevant questions,"}, {"title": "3. Technology Description", "content": "WASHtsApp is a RAG-powered chatbot that responds to WhatsApp messages.

Developments", "content": "WASHtsApp comprises five main components: User Interface, Backend Connector, Backend, RAG Component, and Database.\nThe User Interface leverages a WhatsApp Business Account registered with a Ugandan mobile number. This comes with several advantages:\nMany users are familiar to interface and usage and there is no learning curve.\nMany users have WhatsApp installed and there is no inertia to install a new app.\nThe user interface of WhatsApp is optimized for user experience.\nThe Backend Connector utilizes the WhatsApp Business API Webhook. There are several ways to connect a WhatsApp to a custom Backend server. Different approaches vary in cost and feature set. While the WhatsApp Business API lacks built-in chatbot features and a user-friendly communication interface, it offers two key advantages to other approaches:\nWe do not need to have a smartphone running to keep the communication up and are therefore at least on this side independent of power and network (compared to e.g., AutoResponder App)\nThe cost is lower as if we would include another third-party platform that would also ask for its share (e.g., compared to Twilio Platform)\nA simple Flask application (Python) deployed on Google Cloud App Engine serves as the Backend. The Backend is rather slim and performing only some very basic checks. It primarily prepares incoming messages for the RAG Component (parsing webhook calls and"}, {"title": "5. Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.1 Content Validation", "content": "The results of the expert assessments of WASHtsApp's answers are summed up in Figure 2. We did not average the expert assessments, as the scale does not allow so, but only added the total number of each time a scale was selected. In three cases, where the answer was missing, we defaulted the answer to \u201cI don't know\u201d."}, {"title": "5.2 Community Validation", "content": "77 persons completed the community validation questionnaire after interacting with WASHtsApp. Six of the respondents were removed from the evaluation, as their answers seemed to be unrealistically inconsistent within the items. A statistical power analysis, assuming a moderate effect size, a power level of 0.8 and a probability level of 0.05 would require 57 responses to detect effect, indicating that the remaining 71 allow a statistically sound evaluation. 55% of respondents were aged 19-29, followed by the 30-39 group (28%). 62% were male."}, {"title": "6. Business Benefits", "content": "WASHtsApp does not directly serve a business use case and is also not intended to sell its service for money. However, undoubtedly, progress in SDG6 significantly contributes to a country's development and economic growth [1]. Reduced healthcare costs, decreased sick leave and income loss, and increased capacity, particularly among vulnerable populations, can contribute to both national GDP and individual economic growth."}, {"title": "7. Conclusions", "content": "This paper discussed and evaluated WASHtsApp's applicability for educational and coaching deployments supporting SDG6, as suggested by i.e., [10], [11]. We found that the chatbot's content quality and community acceptance were validated.\nSurely, the current prototype leaves still plenty of space to be further developed. The knowledge base materials could be tailored more closely to the local context. The knowledge base can be enriched with documents on local legislation, organizations, and initiatives promoting improved water access and sanitation. Additionally, we plan to support voice and image inputs, as well as multiple local languages.\nHowever, the potential usefulness of such a system became already clear at that level and can be extended far beyond the described use case. Each user interaction with the chatbot deepens our understanding of current water, sanitation, and hygiene challenges faced by the rural population. By leveraging WhatsApp's bidirectional communication and collected contact data, we can gather additional information on user demographics, such as gender, location, and age. This will further help to make informed decisions which areas require intervention. Interventions can be implemented either through on-the-ground teams or by delivering tailored information via WASHtsApp."}, {"title": "Acknowledgements", "content": "We express our gratitude to our WASH experts [blinded for review], [blinded for review], Joshua Kurtz, and Lukas Dittrich for their valuable contribution to the content validity assessment of this research.

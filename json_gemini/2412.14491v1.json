PoC quantify whether one event was the real cause of another in a given scenario (Robins and Greenland 1989; Tian and Pearl 2000; Pearl 2009; Kuroki and Cai 2011; Dawid, Murtas, and Musio 2014; Murtas, Dawid, and Musio 2017; Shingaki and Kuroki 2021; Kawakami, Shingaki, and Kuroki 2023). PoC are valuable for decision-making (Hannart and Naveau 2018; Li and Pearl 2019, 2022) and for explaining AI-based decision-making systems (Galhotra, Pradhan, and Salimi 2021; Watson et al. 2021).\nVarious variants of PoC have been studied, including for multi-valued discrete variables (Li and Pearl 2024a,b) and for continuous and vector variables (Kawakami, Kuroki, and Tian 2024). Rubinstein, Cuellar, and Malinsky (2024) introduced direct and indirect mediated PoC to decompose total PoC when there exists a mediator between the treatment and outcome.\nCausal mediation analysis is a key method for uncovering the influence of different pathways between the treatment and outcome through mediators (Wright 1921, 1934; Baron and Kenny 1986; Robins and Greenland 1992; Imai, Keele, and Tingley 2010; Imai, Keele, and Yamamoto 2010; Tchetgen and Shpitser 2012). Notably, Pearl (2001) formally defined direct and indirect effects for general nonlinear models. Causal mediation analysis is also a valuable technique for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (Shin 2021). In this paper, we aim to provide causal mediation analysis for PoC, to reveal the necessity and sufficiency of the treatment through different pathways. Once a treatment is revealed to be necessary and sufficient to induce a particular event via PNS, other causal questions would arise:\n(Q1). Would the treatment still be necessary and sufficient had the value of the mediator been fixed to a certain value?\n(Q2). Would the treatment still be necessary and sufficient had there been no influence via the mediator?\n(Q3). Would the treatment still be necessary and sufficient had the influence only existed via the mediator?\nWe introduce new variants of PoC - controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect PNS (CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS) to answer these questions. We further define direct and indirect PoC with evidence to capture more sophisticated counterfactual information useful for decision-making. These quantities can retrospectively answer questions (Q1), (Q2), and (Q3) for a specific subpopulation. We provide identification results for each type of PoC we introduce. Finally, we apply our results to a real-world psychology dataset."}, {"title": "Notations and Background", "content": "We represent a single or vector variable with a capital letter (X) and its realized value with a small letter (x). Let $I(\\cdot)$ be an indicator function that takes 1 if the statement in (\u00b7) is true and 0 otherwise. Denote $\\Omega_Y$ be the domain of variable Y, $E[Y]$ be the expectation of Y, $P(Y < y)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of continuous variable Y, and $p(Y = y)$ be the probability density function (PDF) of continuous variable Y. We use $X \\perp Y | C$ to denote that X and Y are conditionally independent given C. We use $\\prec$ to denote a total order. A formal definition of total order is given in Appendix A.\nStructural causal models (SCM). We use the language of SCMs as our basic framework and follow the standard definition in the following (Pearl 2009). An SCM M is a tuple $(V, U, F, P_U)$, where U is a set of exogenous (unobserved) variables following a distribution $P_U$, and V is a set of endogenous (observable) variables whose values are determined by structural functions $F = {f_{V_i}}_{V_i \\in V}$ such that $v_i := f_{V_i}(pa_{V_i}, u_{V_i})$ where $PA_{V_i} \\subseteq V$ and $U_{V_i} \\subseteq U$. Each SCM M induces an observational distribution $P_V$ over V, and a causal graph G(M) in which there exists a directed edge from every variable in $PA_{V_i}$ and $U_{V_i}$ to $V_i$. An intervention of setting a set of endogenous variables X to constants x, denoted by $do(x)$, replaces the original equations of X by the constants \u00e6 and induces a sub-model $M_x$. We denote the potential outcome Y under intervention $do(x)$ by $Y_x(u)$, which is the solution of Y in the sub-model $M_x$ given U = u.\nProbabilities of causation (PoC). Kawakami, Kuroki, and Tian (2024) defined the (multivariate conditional) PoC for vectors of continuous or discrete variables as follows:\nDefinition 1 (PoC). (Kawakami, Kuroki, and Tian 2024) The (multivariate conditional) PoC are defined by\n$PNS(y; x', x, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} \\ge y \\angle Y_x | C = c)$, (1)\n$PN(y; x', x, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y | y \\le Y_x, X = x, C = c)$, (2)\n$PS(y; x', x, c) \\equiv P(y \\le Y_x | Y_{x'} < y, X = x', C = c)$. (3)\n$PNS(y; x', x, c)$ provides a measure of the necessity and sufficiency of x w.r.t. x' to produce $Y \\ge y$ given C = c. $PN(y; x', x, c)$ and $PS(y; x', x, c)$ provide a measure of the necessity and sufficiency, respectively, of x w.r.t. x' to produce $Y \\ge y$ given C = c.\nWe will often call PNS total PNS (T-PNS) and denote it by T-PNS(y; x', x, c) for convenience. When treatment X and outcome Y are binary, PNS, PS, and PS become (setting y = 1) $PNS(c) = P(Y_0 = 0, Y_1 = 1 | C = c)$, $PN(c) = P(Y_0 = 0 | Y_1 = 1, X = 1, C = c)$, and $PS(c) = P(Y_1 = 1 | Y_0 = 0, X = 0, C = c)$ for any $c \\in \\Omega_C$, which reduce to Pearl's (1999) original definition when C = 0.\nCausal mediation analysis. Causal mediation analysis reveals the strength of different pathways between treatment and outcome through a mediator. Researchers often consider the following SCM M:\n$Y := f_Y(X, M, C, U_Y), M := f_M(X, C, U_M)$,\n$X := f_X(C, U_X), C := f_C(U_C)$, (4)\nwhere all variables can be vectors, and $U_X, U_C, U_Y$, and $U_M$ are latent exogenous variables. Assume that the domains $\\Omega_Y$ and $\\Omega_{U_Y} \\times \\Omega_{U_M}$ are totally ordered sets with $\\prec$. Figure 1 shows the causal graph of SCM M (with latent variables dropped).\nOne widely used model in the mediation analysis is a linear SCM $M_L$ (Baron and Kenny 1986) consisting of $Y := \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 M + \\beta_3 C + U_Y$ and $M := \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 X + \\alpha_2 C + U_M$, where $U_Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$ and $U_M \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_M, \\sigma_M^2)$ are independent normal distribution. Under SCM $M_L$, the total effect of X on Y is $\\beta_1 + \\alpha_1 \\beta_2$, the indirect effect is $\\alpha_1 \\beta_2$, and the direct effect is $\\beta_1$.\nPearl (2001) defined the total, controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect effects for general (nonlinear and nonparametric) SCM M.\nDefinition 2 (TE, CDE, NDE, and NIE). (Pearl 2001) The total, controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect effects are defined by:\n1. Total Effect (TE): $TE(y; x', x) = E[Y_x] - E[Y_{x'}]$\n2. Controlled Direct Effect (CDE): $CDE(y; x', x, m) = E[Y_{x,m}] - E[Y_{x',m}]$\n3. Natural Direct Effect (NDE): $NDE(y; x', x) = E[Y_{x, M_x}] - E[Y_{x', M_{x'}}]$\n4. Natural Indirect Effect (NIE): $NIE(y; x', x) = E[Y_{x', M_x}] - E[Y_{x'}]$\nCDE represents the causal effect of changing the treatment from x' to x had the value of the mediator been fixed at a certain value. NDE represents the causal effect of changing the treatment from x' to x had the value of the mediator been kept to the same value $M_x$ that M attains under x'. NIE represents the causal effect of changing the mediator from $M_{x'}$ to $M_x$ had the value of the treatment been fixed to x'. TE can be decomposed into NDE and NIE by $TE(y; x', x) = NDE(y; x', x) - NIE(y; x, x') = NIE(y; x', x) - NDE(y; x, x').\nThese direct and indirect effects may be identified from observational distributions under various settings (Pearl 2001; Avin, Shpitser, and Pearl 2005; Shpitser and Pearl 2008; Shpitser 2013; Malinsky, Shpitser, and Richardson 2019). A widely used assumption for identifying causal mediation effects is the following sequential ignorability assumption (Imai, Keele, and Tingley 2010):\nAssumption 1 (Sequential ignorability). The following two conditional independence statements hold:\n(1) {$Y_{x,m}, M_x$} $||$ X | C = c and (2) $M_x$ $||$ $Y_{x,m}$ | C = c\nfor any $m \\in \\Omega_M$ and $x \\in \\Omega_X$, where $p(X = x | C = c) > 0$ and $p(M = m | X = x, C = c) > 0$ for any $m \\in \\Omega_M$, $x \\in \\Omega_X$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$.\nWe have\nProposition 1 (Identification of $P(Y_{x',M_x} < y | C = c)$). (Imai, Keele, and Tingley 2010; VanderWeele and Knol 2014) Under SCM M and Assumption 1, the counterfactual $P(Y_{x',M_x} | C = c)$ is identifiable by\n$P(Y_{x',M_x} | C = c)$ = $\\int_{\\Omega_M} P(Y < y | X = x', M = m, C = c) \\times p(M = m | X = x, C = c) dm$ (5)\nfor any $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$, $y \\in \\Omega_Y$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$."}, {"title": "Direct and Indirect PNS", "content": "In this section, we introduce new concepts of direct and indirect PNS and provide corresponding identification results.\nWe will focus our attention on PNS, and show in the next section that direct and indirect PN and PS can be derived as special cases of direct and indirect PNS with evidence.\nDefinition of CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS\nWe define controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect probabilities of necessity and sufficiency.\nDefinition 3 (CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS). The controlled direct, natural direct, and natural indirect PNS (CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS) are defined by\n$CD-PNS(y; x', x, m, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x',m} < y \\le Y_{x,m} | C = c)$, (6)\n$ND-PNS(y; x', x, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x, Y_{x',M_x} < y | C = c)$, (7)\n$NI-PNS(y; x', x, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x, y \\le Y_{x',M_x} | C = c)$. (8)\nFirst, the controlled direct PNS (CD-PNS) provides a measure of the necessity and sufficiency of x w.r.t. x' to produce $Y \\ge y$ given C = c when the mediator is fixed to a value M = m. CD-PNS can be used to answer the causal question (Q1). CD-PNS consists of two counterfactual conditions:\n(A1). \"had the treatment and the mediator been (x', m), the outcome would be $Y < y$\u201d ($Y_{x',m} < y$); and\n(A2). \u201chad the treatment and the mediator been (x, m), the outcome would be $y \\le Y$\u201d ($y \\le Y_{x,m}$).\nConditions (A1) and (A2) have different values of treatment and the same values of mediator. The relative values of the potential outcomes $Y_{x,m}$ are shown in Figure 2 (b). For comparison, Figure 2 (a) shows the situation for T-PNS.\nSecond, ND-PNS has three counterfactual conditions:\n(B1). \"had the treatment been x', the outcome would be $Y < y$\u201d ($Y_{x'} = Y_{x',M_x} < y$),\n(B2). \u201chad the treatment been x' but the mediator was kept at the same value $M_x$ when the treatment is x, the outcome would be $Y < y$\u201d ($Y_{x',M_x} < y$), and\n(B3). \u201chad the treatment been x, the outcome would be $y \\le Y$\u201d ($y \\le Y_x = Y_{x,M_x}$).\nThe relative values of the potential outcomes are shown in Figure 2 (c). Conditions (B1) and (B3) mean $Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x$, which is the same condition in T-PNS and represents that the treatment x is necessary and sufficient w.r.t. x' to provoke the event $y \\le Y$ given C = c. Conditions (B2) and (B3) mean $Y_{x', M_x} < y \\le Y_{x,M_x}$, which represents the necessity and sufficiency of x w.r.t. x' to produce $Y \\ge y$ given C = c when keeping the values of the mediator by the same as $M_x$. In other words, they mean that the treatment would be necessary and sufficient even if there were no influences via the mediator. Therefore, ND-PNS can answer the causal question (Q2).\nThird, NI-PNS has three counterfactual conditions:\n(C1). \"had the treatment been x', the outcome would be $Y < y$\u201d ($Y_{x'} = Y_{x',M_x} < y$),\n(C2)."}, {"title": "Identification of CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS", "content": "Next, we provide identification theorems for the direct and indirect PNSs we have introduced.\nAssumptions The identification of PoC relies on monotonicity assumptions in the literature (Tian and Pearl 2000). We will make similar assumptions, specifically similar to those in (Kawakami, Kuroki, and Tian 2024).\nAssumption 2. Potential outcome $Y_{x,m}$ has conditional PDF $P_{Y_{x,m}|C=c}$ for each $x \\in \\Omega_X$, $m \\in \\Omega_M$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, and its support {$y \\in \\Omega_Y : P_{Y_{x,m}|C=c}(y) \\neq 0$} is the same for each $x \\in \\Omega_X$, $m \\in \\Omega_M$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$.\nAssumption 3. Potential outcome $Y_{x', M_x}$ has conditional PDF $P_{Y_{x',M_x}|C=c}$ for each $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$ and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, and its support {$y \\in \\Omega_Y : P_{Y_{x',M_x}|C=c}(y) \\neq 0$} is the same for each $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$ and $c \\in \\Omega_C$.\nAssumptions 2 and 3 are reasonable for continuous variables. For example, potential outcomes $Y_{x,m}, Y_{x', M_x}$ often has $[-\\infty, \\infty]$ support, such as in linear SCM $M_L$.\nWe assume the following monotonicity condition for identifying CD-PNS:\nAssumption 4 (Monotonicity over $f_Y$). The function $f_Y(x, m, c, U_Y)$ is either monotonic increasing on $U_Y$ for all $x \\in \\Omega_X$, $m \\in \\Omega_M$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, or monotonic decreasing on $U_Y$ for all $x \\in \\Omega_X$, $m \\in \\Omega_M$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, almost surely w.r.t. $P_{U_Y}$.\nAlternatively, one may assume monotonicity over potential outcomes:\nAssumption 4' (Conditional monotonicity over $Y_{x,m}$) The potential outcomes $Y_{x,m}$ satisfy: for any $x, x' \\in \\Omega_X$, $m \\in \\Omega_M$, $y \\in \\Omega_Y$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, either $P(Y_{x',m} \\ge y \\le Y_{x,m} | C = c) = 0$ or $P(Y_{x,m} < y \\le Y_{x',m} | C = c) = 0$.\nAssumptions 4 and 4' are equivalent under Assumption 2 (a straightforward extension of Theorem 4.1 in (Kawakami, Kuroki, and Tian 2024)). We note that the widely used linear SCM $M_L$ satisfies Assumption 4. Furthermore, another popular model, a nonlinear SCM with normal distribution $M_N$, consisting of $Y := f_Y(X, M, C) + U_Y$ and $M := f(X, C) + U_M$, where $U_Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$ and $U_M \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_M, \\sigma_M^2)$, also satisfies Assumptions 2-4.\nLet the compound function $f_Y \\circ f_M$ represent $(f_Y \\circ f_M)(x', x, c, \\tilde{U}) = f_Y(x', f_M(x, c, U_M), c, U_Y)$ for all $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$ and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, where $\\tilde{U} = (U_Y, U_M)$. We assume the following for identifying ND-PNS and NI-PNS:\nAssumption 5 (Monotonicity over $f_Y \\circ f_M$). The function $(f_Y \\circ f_M)(x', x, c, \\tilde{U})$ is either monotonic increasing on $\\tilde{U}$ for all $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$ and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, or monotonic decreasing on $\\tilde{U}$ for all $x', x \\in \\Omega_X$ and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, almost surely w.r.t. $P_{\\tilde{U}}$.\nOr, alternatively,\nAssumption 5' (Conditional monotonicity over $Y_{x', M_x}$) The potential outcomes $Y_{x', M_x}$ satisfy: for any $x, x', x'', x''' \\in \\Omega_X$, $y \\in \\Omega_Y$, and $c \\in \\Omega_C$, either $P(Y_{x',M_x} \\ge y \\le Y_{x''',M_{x''}} | C = c) = 0$ or $P(Y_{x''',M_{x''}} < y \\le Y_{x',M_x} | C = c) = 0$.\nSimilarly, Assumptions 5 and 5' are equivalent under Assumption 3. We note that both the linear SCM $M_L$ and the nonlinear SCM with normal distribution $M_N$ satisfy Assumption 5 with $\\tilde{U} = U_Y + U_M$.\nLemmas. Then, we obtain the following results.\nLemma 1. Under SCM M, and Assumptions 2 and 4,\n$CD-PNS(y; x', x, m, c) = max {P(Y_{x',m} < y | C = c) - P(Y_{x,m} < y | C = c), 0}$. (10)\nLemma 2. Under SCM M, and Assumptions 3 and 5,\n$ND-PNS(y; x', x, c) = max {min{P(Y_{x'} < y | C = c), P(Y_{x',M_x} < y | C = c)} - P(Y_x < y | C = c), 0}$, (11)\n$NI-PNS(y; x', x, c) = max {P(Y_x < y | C = c) - max{P(Y_{x'} < y | C = c), P(Y_{x',M_x} < y | C = c)}, 0}$. (12)\nThe lemmas mean that, under monotonicity, CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS can be computed from the CDF of certain counterfactual outcomes.\nIdentification theorems. The CDF of the counterfactual outcomes $P(Y_{x',M_x} < y | C = c)$ is identifiable under the sequential ignorability Assumption 1 by Proposition 1 as $P(Y_{x',M_x} | C = c) = p(y; x', x, c)$, where we denote\n$p(y; x', x, c) = \\int_{\\Omega_M} P(Y < y | X = x', M = m, C = c) \\times p(M = m | X = x, C = c) dm$. (13)\nThen, we obtain the following identification theorems by combining Lemmas 1 and 2 and Proposition 1:"}, {"title": "Direct and Indirect PNS with Evidence", "content": "In this section, we define CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence and provide corresponding identification theorems. Specifically, we consider two types of evidence:\n$\\mathcal{E} \\triangleq (X = x^*, M = m^*, Y \\in \\mathcal{I}_Y)$, (17)\n$\\mathcal{E'} \\triangleq (X = x^*, Y \\in \\mathcal{I}_Y)$, (18)\nwhere $\\mathcal{I}_Y$ is a half-open interval $[y^l, y^u)$ or a closed interval $[y^l, y^u]$ w.r.t. $\\prec$. PNS with evidence allows us to examine PNS for a specific subpopulation characterized by the evidence.\nThe main distinction between the evidence $\\mathcal{E}$ or $\\mathcal{E'}$ and the subject's covariates C in the definition of CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS (Def. 3) is that C in the SCM M are pre-treatment variables but $\\mathcal{E}$ are post-treatment variables. Conditioning on post-treatment variables differs from traditional conditioning on pre-treatment variables and has been discussed in the context of PN or PS (Pearl 1999) and the posterior causal effects (Lu et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023). They have applications in various fields, such as attribution of risk factors in public health and epidemiology, medical diagnosis of diseases, root-cause diagnosis in equipment and production processes, and reference measures for penalties in law.\nDefinitions of CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence\nFirst, we define CD-PNS with evidence $\\mathcal{E}$, and T-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence $\\mathcal{E'}$ 1.\nDefinition 4 (CD-PNS, T-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence). CD-PNS with evidence $\\mathcal{E}$, and T-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence $\\mathcal{E'}$ are defined by\n$CD-PNS(y; x', x, m, \\mathcal{E}, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x',m} < y \\le Y_{x,m} | \\mathcal{E}, C = c)$, (19)\n$T-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x | \\mathcal{E'}, C = c)$, (20)\n$ND-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x, Y_{x',M_x} < y | \\mathcal{E'}, C = c)$, (21)\n$NI-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c) \\equiv P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x, y \\le Y_{x',M_x} | \\mathcal{E'}, C = c)$. (22)\nCD-PNS with evidence can answer questions: \"What is the probability that the situation in the question (Q1) holds for the subjects, when, in reality, their treatment is $x^*$, their mediator is $m^*$, their outcome is in $\\mathcal{I}_Y$, and their covariates is c?\" ND-PNS and NI-PNS with evidence can answer questions: \"What is the probability that the situation in the questions (Q2) and (Q3) hold, when, in reality, their treatment is $x^*$, their outcome is in $\\mathcal{I}_Y$, and their covariates is c?\" CD-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence can retrospectively answer questions for the specific subpopulation characterized by the evidence.\nThe following desired decomposition property holds:\nProposition 3.\n$T-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c) = ND-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c) + NI-PNS(y; x', x, \\mathcal{E'}, c)$. (23)\nRemark 3. We do not use mediator information in evidence for T-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS because a more strict assumption is required for identification to exploit mediator information. In Appendix C, we provide an identification theorem (Theorem 4') of T-PNS, ND-PNS, and NI-PNS with evidence $\\mathcal{E'} = (X = x^*, M \\in \\mathcal{I}_M, Y \\in \\mathcal{I}_Y)$ with an additional assumption, where $\\mathcal{I}_M$ is a half-open interval $[m^l, m^u)$ w.r.t. the total order on $\\Omega_M$.\nND-PN, NI-PN, ND-PS, and NI-PS. So far, we have focused our attention on PNS in the PoC family. It turns out that PN and PS, the other two members of the PoC family defined in Def. 1, can be computed as special cases of T-PNS with evidence. Specifically, PN is equivalent to T-PNS with the evidence $\\mathcal{E'} = (y \\le Y, X = x)$, and PS is equivalent to T-PNS with the evidence $\\mathcal{E'} = (Y < y, X = x')$ as follows.\nProposition 4. We have the following:\n$PN(y; x', x, c) = P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x | y \\le Y, X = x, C = c)$, (24)\n$PS(y; x', x, c) = P(Y_{x'} < y \\le Y_x | Y < y, X = x', C = c)$.

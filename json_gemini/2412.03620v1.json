INTRODUCTION", "content": "The overall objective of the 17 sustainability development goals (SDGs see Table I) (e.g., no poverty and quality education) is to provide a universal call to end poverty, planet protection, and to ensure that people enjoy peace and prosperity also with the goal to establish a balance of social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Existing research [118] has already shown that Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and techniques can have positive as well as negative impacts ranging from efficient energy production and distribution to negative aspects such as increasing power consumption scenarios due to different types of large-scale machine learning efforts [120]. In this article, we analyze potentials of recommender systems as a key technology to support the mentioned SDGs.\nRecommender systems can be regarded as decision support systems combining AI technologies such as machine learning, explanations, and intelligent user interfaces with the overall goal to improve a user's decision quality [19], [33]. There are different types of recommender systems with differing applicability depending on the underlying recommendation scenario.\n(1) Collaborative filtering (CF) [32] follows the idea of word-of-mouth promotion where opinions of family members and friends (the so-called \"nearest neighbors\") are regarded as relevant recommendations for a person. (2) Content-based Filtering (CBF) [78] is based on the idea that if a person had specific preferences in the (near) past, these preferences would more or less remain stable and can be used for future item recommendations. (3) Knowledge-based recommender systems (KBR) [20] are based on the idea of determining recommendations on the basis of a more in-depth semantic knowledge expressed, for example, in terms of constraints [37] or with attribute-level similarity metrics [26]. (4) Hybrid recommender systems (HYB) [21] focus on exploiting synergy effects by trying to combine the advantages of different recommendation approaches, for example, combining CF and CBF helps to tackle the challenges of ramp-up problems (when, e.g., CF rating data are not available for a specific user). (5) Group recommender systems (GRP) [36] focus on the determination of recommendations for groups, i.e., not individual users. Such approaches have to identify recommendations that help to achieve \u2013 in one way or another a consensus among group members.\u00b2\nIn this article, we focus on indicating in which ways recommender systems can be applied to better achieve the mentioned SDGs. With this, the major contributions of our article are the following: (1) we provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in applying recommender systems for achieving the 17 SDGs. (2) on the basis of this overview, we discuss different open issues for future research. (3) For the given SDGs, we provide concrete working examples of how to apply recommender systems.

RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY", "content": "In contrast to existing approaches to evaluate the impact of recommender systems which are primarily focused on different e-commerce scenarios [48], we focus on the impact of recommender systems in terms of achieving sustainability development goals Table I provides a short overview of the 17 United Nations (UN) sustainability development goals.\nIn the following discussions, we differentiate between (1) a macro-level representing recommendations determined for abstract organizations (e.g., countries, company types, and types of study programmes) and (2) a micro-level representing recommendations determined for concrete entities (e.g., citizens, companies, and tourists). We exemplify the application of recommender systems with a focus on basic recommendations approaches, i.e., the goal in this article is to discuss application scenarios but not primarily detailed algorithmic approaches."}, {"title": "A. No Poverty", "content": "The related major goal is to end poverty everywhere. Poverty has a multitude of definitions and can be characterized in a monetary dimension in terms of not having enough money to maintain his/her livelihood \u2013 a related overview of AI methods to estimate the degree of poverty in a region/country can be found in [115]. Examples of data sources used in such contexts are, for example, household data (e.g., demographics, education, and food consumption), food price data, and e-commerce data [115]. Poverty prediction has to be accompanied with approaches that help to counteract poverty. For example, [24] show how recommendation techniques can be applied to identify export diversification strategies in such a way that a country has a latent competitive advantage (when following this strategy).\nAn important measure in this context is the so-called Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) score (for a country 0 and product \u03c0) (see Formula 1) [8] which is used to determine the importance of individual items (products) in the export basket of a country. In this context, $E_{\\theta\\pi}$ is the export value of item (product) \u03c0 for country 0.\n$\\text{RCAScore}_{e} = \\frac{E_{\\theta \\pi} / \\sum_{\\pi} E_{\\theta \\pi}}{\\sum_{\\theta} E_{\\theta \\pi} / \\sum_{\\Theta} \\sum_{\\pi} E_{\\theta \\pi}}$   (1)\nIn the line of [24], recommendation services can be provided on the basis of the RCAScore of individual items. When applying collaborative filtering (CF), an item \u00d7 RCAScore matrix summarizes the scores of items already exported by individual countries. CF can now be applied to predict the relevance (RCAScore) of new items not exported by individual countries up to now. In the example shown in Table II,"}, {"title": "B. Zero Hunger", "content": "The related goal is to end hunger and to achieve improved nutrition and food security while at the same time promoting sustainable agriculture. In contrast to the application of recommender systems in the context of healthy living [110], a major focus of sustainability in the context of achieving zero hunger is to foster more conscious food consumption and to support food production processes with a clear sustainability focus [16], [40], [70]. A related crop diversification (recommendation), i.e., choosing and diversifying crops, can help governments to grow more crops in ones own country and with this to reduce dependencies to other countries [40]. This also includes mechanisms to effectively detect crop diseases [76].\nThe appropriate determination of crop factors such as maturity date, soil suitability, and pesticide requirements becomes increasingly important. Not least, to be able to choose the optimal crop in the long run as well as to optimize production and to minimize additional efforts in terms of pesticides and soil fertilization. A simplified example of a potential application of recommender systems in crop selection is shown in Table V. In this example, the question is if crop2 (the current entry) could be relevant for region D (no corresponding experience data available). Since average temperature and soil moisture are quite similar to region C (the nearest neighbor \u2013 id=5), the expected crop2 output for this region is about 83% with a recommended pesticide usage p3. In real-world settings, further parameters are needed for determining high-quality recommendations [40].\nFood rescue organizations focus on collecting and delivering food donations to those in need [89]. In many cases, collected food is in temporary storage at the rescue organization where it is offered to persons in need. Collecting the food from various local food providers is a logistic problem in the sense that volunteers need to be identified who are willing to take over a specific pick-up and food delivery task. [89] present a recommender system that helps to identify candidate persons with a high probability of willing to perform a new collection and delivery task.\nA simplified example of supporting such scenarios on the basis of content-based filtering is depicted in Table VI. In"}, {"title": "C. Good Health and Wellbeing", "content": "The related goal is to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing. The success of public health campaigns heavily depends on the appropriateness of health messages delivered to users [22]. In such scenarios, recommender systems can help to personalize message delivery given some knowledge about features and topics of interest for a user. A simple approach can be a topic-wise recommendation where new messages/campaigns are forwarded to citizens in a personalized fashion. A related simplified example is depicted in Table VII: user interests are stored in a corresponding user profile, for example, users has a high interest in healthy eating and healthy cooking. A new health campaign should be issued and the task is to identify those users with some basic potential interest in the related topics. The most relevant topics of messagenew are healthy eating and healthy cooking - in this scenario users and to some extent user2 have related interests, i.e., these users should be contacted in the context of the new campaign. As such, this is a simple example of applying content-based filtering in the context of delivering public health campaigns [22]. To assure that users get also in touch with new topics, diversity-enhanced and collaborative recommendation can be applied to increase serendipity effects [83].\nAnother related example on the macro-level is the support of machine learning and recommender systems in the context of vaccine allocation and distribution where appropriate planning and fairness aspects play a major role [12]. In this scenario, aspects such as population size, percentage of individuals who have already received a previous dose, and storage capacity for the vaccines are important factors to be taken into account."}, {"title": "D. Quality Education", "content": "Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities requires the inclusion of modern communication technologies as well as corresponding personalization concepts which help to tailor learning contents in such a way that learners can have a personalized learning experience [52].\nAn example of applying group recommender systems in e-learning contexts on the macro level is policy decision making regarding the establishment of a new study program at a university. In such a scenario, alternative study programs could be discussed by a group of responsible stakeholders where each stakeholder can provide related proposals him/herself and can give feedback on the other existing proposals/ideas simply by evaluating the interest dimensions feasibility (are the personal resources available for teaching the new courses?) and interest (will students be interested in enrolling in the new study program?) (see Table IX). We assume an evaluation scale [1..10] 1 indicating low and 10 indicating high feasibility/interest.\nIf we assume an equal importance of the interest dimensions feasibility and interest, the AI (Artifical Intelligence) study program could be recommended to the stakeholders since it has the highest average (AVG) evaluation. A more detailed discussion on the utility-based evaluation of alternative solutions (items, products) can be found in [36], [38].\nOn the micro-level, there exist a couple of recommendation approaches supporting the recommendation of learning items [52], [84]. On the one hand, content-based filtering can be applied in situations where new learning items are available for learners who are interested in a longterm learning experience regarding a specific topic. This is similar to news recommendation where news gets recommended to users with a corresponding topic-wise reading preference. In the context of university courses, students can estimate their topic-wise expertise by answering corresponding test questions [98]. For those topics with a lower knowledge level, content-based recommendation can be used to recommend topic-specific contents ranked on the basis of their complexity level (see Table X).\nIf we assume that Table X is a result of a student pre-test questionnaire, the corresponding correctness shares can be used to rank the questions with regard to their complexity. For questions answered incorrectly, corresponding learning contents can be recommended, for example, by a content-based match between question category names and corresponding content categories. For example, student 83 did not answer any"}, {"title": "E. Gender Equality", "content": "The underlying goal is to achieve gender equality and to empower all women and girls. A major aspect in the context of achieving gender equality is the concept of fairness in terms of a gender-independent equal treatment. In recommender systems, fairness aspects play an important role in terms of assuring this property with regard to stakeholders [60], for example, in music streaming platforms, musicians are interested in having their songs played and users in maximizing their positive song experience.\nWe expect the availability of different metrics (criteria) that help to analyze the degree to which fairness aspects have to be taken into account as well as pointing out possibilities to counteract unfair treatments [99], [127]. Examples thereof are equal opportunity requiring the same share of true positives for individual recommender system users or groups, envy-freeness indicating to which extent individual users or groups prefer their recommendations over the recommendations given to other users or groups, and demographic parity indicating that recommendations should be similar around an attribute such as gender [127]. A simple example of how to measure the equal opportunity parity (on a scale [0..1]) of a job recommender is provided in Formula 3.\n$fairness = 1 - |accuracy(male) \u2013 accuracy(female)|   (3)\nThere are different ways of assuring fairness [94] ranging from (1) the pre-processing of a dataset on the basis of imputation, (2) the provision of fairness-aware algorithms (e.g., on the basis of integrating fairness into machine learning regularization terms) and (3) the post-processing of generated recommendations (e.g., on the basis of re-ranking recommendations). An example of assuring fairness in a group recommendation scenario (job candidate selection) is depicted in Table XI."}, {"title": "F. Clean Water and Sanitation", "content": "Cornerstones for the availability of clean water and sanitation are intelligent systems supporting the planning, implementation, and operation of corresponding technical infrastructures [64], [65].\nWater management as a whole heavily relies on knowledge about the location-specific quality of water resources which is highly relevant for decision makers, involved in tasks such as land development planning. To identify relevant locations and also to predict the development of water sources over time, recommender systems can help to predict, for example, the pH level \u2013 for related details on an example application we refer to [65]. Related techniques for designing relevant sanitation concepts are also in the need of a decision support able to integrate local decision makers [64].\nIn the context of optimizing household water consumption, recommender systems can be applied to sensitize users in terms of adapting, i.e., reducing their water consumption [7]. Table XII provides a simple example dataset representing different households with corresponding consumption data. Our assumption in this context is the availability of smart-meter technologies allowing the measurement of water consumptions with individual water devices."}, {"title": "G. Affordable and Clean Energy", "content": "The major related goal is the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Recommender systems can help in the establishment of related energy provision infrastructures such as wind energy systems with layout planning [100] and related performance optimizations [80], [116]. Achieving the goal of supporting affordable and clean energy also requires the support of public campaigns that indicate in the form of explanations and argumentations which behavior patterns can help to reduce individual energy consumption which is a major goal of assuring affordable and clean energy [97]. A similar scenario has already been discussed within the scope of the goal of good health and wellbeing, i.e., a recommender system can be applied to personalize related messages. Message personalization requires the availability of basic user data such as type of home (e.g., apartment vs. own house), number of family members, and further information regarding personal energy consumption patterns [30] and also knowledge about persuasive technologies [2] and effective user interfaces [96] to achieve sustainable behavior.\nOn the level of individual households, energy efficiency can be achieved on the basis of household-specific energy breakdowns [10], [46]. In this context, recommendation techniques of collaborative filtering and matrix factorization can help to predict the energy consumption of households who did not perform a breakdown up to now, for example, for reasons of related costs [10]. Household-specific energy consumption can also be triggered on the basis of comparative and community-based explanations [79] where the energy saving performance of individual households can be compared to each other indicating personal performances compared to other households. Norm-based comparisons are an example thereof: the majority of similar households show a better energy saving compared to your current savings data. Furthermore, explanations can refer to energy consumption in the past (self-comparison feedback) and indicate improvement or deterioration."}, {"title": "H. Decent Work and Economic Growth", "content": "The underlying goal is to promote economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Nowadays, recommender systems can be regarded as a core technology"}, {"title": "I. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure", "content": "The underlying goal is to promote innovation, sustainable industrialization, and resilient infrastructures. Industrial applications of recommender systems are many-fold and range from the recommendation of movies [41], the recommendation of books [92], recommendations in the dating business [106], to the recommendation of airline offers [27]. Beyond acting as a support of core business processes (e.g., selling books), recommender systems can also act in a supportive role which is often the case with sustainability topics.\nRecommender systems can be applied as a knowledge transfer medium for different industrial segments to indicate possibilities in terms of process improvements and the inclusion of sustainable materials into production processes [124]. Identifying sustainability properties of products is often not an easy task - examples of such properties are environmental impact, animal welfare, and customer benefits [107]. Due to a lack of easily accessible sustainability information, customers do not always behave as intended, i.e., although interested in sustainability, they take sub-optimal decisions due to the lack of related information. [107] introduce a hybrid recommender system where the item-related sustainability classification is based on probabilistic soft logic.\nFostering innovation can be supported in various forms \u2013 examples thereof are innovation processes where recommender systems provide support in the configuration of innovation teams, i.e., who should work together to achieve specific innovation goals [17] and the process of idea generation [44]. An important aspect in software development is to overcome the barriers of taking into account sustainability aspects in software engineering [85]. Also in this context, recommender systems can be applied to support project stakeholders with recommendations that are determined depending on the underlying application domain. Similar applications exist in software development, where intelligent source code analysis can help to identify software elements to be adapted, for example, to achieve more efficient runtimes and corresponding CPU usage [73]."}, {"title": "J. Reduced Inequalities", "content": "Achieving this objective (reduce inequality within and among countries) requires actions such as promoting economic inclusion, direct investments, and fostering mobility and migration to bridge divides.\nOn the macro-level, recommender systems can help to figure out new potentials overlooked by countries, that can trigger future economic welfare due to strategic future advantages [62]. In this line of research, recommender systems can also help to establish new study programs of relevance helping to promote relevant know-how for implementing specific industries. As discussed in [24], recommender systems can be applied in the context of developing export diversification strategies resulting in recommended industry/product segments which should be expanded or established in specific countries. Having identified such segments, recommender systems can also be applied to identify a corresponding educational focus indicating which study programs should be emphasized or established in a specific country or a specific region [101].\nSpecifically in the context of fostering mobility and migration, the task of country recommendation becomes increasingly relevant. [66] motivate the application of country recommender systems since beginning a new life in a different country is for various reasons a high-involvement and often risky decision. The basic underlying idea is to support country"}, {"title": "K. Sustainable Cities and Communities", "content": "The related goal is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. City planners, decision makers, and citizens need to be supported in order to achieve the different goals of sustainable cities and communities. For example, sustainable mobility provides modern commuting systems and facilities on the basis of green infrastructures. Furthermore, in order to assure a smart environment, natural resources need to be preserved.\nRecommender systems can support sustainable smart cities on the basis of supporting strategic decision making. Depending on the context of a specific city, different actions need to be taken in order to be able to achieve related sustainable development goals [13]. Helping public stakeholders to achieve related sustainability goals can be supported, for example, on the basis of case-based recommender systems which follow the idea of supporting the identification of similar cases (cities) and on the basis of related measures already completed in similar cities to recommend sustainability-fostering activities for the current city [9].\nIn such contexts, recommender systems can support also individuals (e.g., citizens and tourists) in the completion of their tasks and the achievement of their goals. For example, sustainable tourism recommender systems are able to propose relevant points of interest (POI) whilst taking into account aspects such as negative environmental impacts, local communities, and cultural heritage [9], [51], [72]. Related interventions are needed that assure fairness among multiple stakeholders such as tourists, tourism organizations, local citizens, and environmental aspects such as water quality, air quality, and wildlife. Calculating recommendations in such scenarios requires the integration of optimization methods supporting, for example, the optimization of round trips of individual travel groups, resource balancing in the sense that not too many tourists visit specific sightseeing destinations at the same time (triggering issues in terms of disturbances, environmental pollution, and the scaring of animals) [72], [90]. In such contexts, explanations can help to assure recommendation"}, {"title": "L. Responsible Consumption and Production", "content": "The underlying goal is to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. A challenge in this context is to find ways to achieve environment sustainability and at the same time to trigger economic growth and welfare by making these two factors much more independent, i.e., to \"achieve more with less\".\nSustainable production is related to the goal of achieving industrial symbioses where cooperations between companies are intensified, for example, with the goal to minimize industrial waste streams and share related knowledge [117]. In such contexts, recommender systems can support individual companies by the recommendation of opportunities in waste marketplaces which in the following could lead to intensified cooperations between companies. In such scenarios, recommender systems must be built in a knowledge-based fashion which helps to assure that the needed knowledge about compatibilities of waste products is available. Such basic recommendations can be enhanced by future recommender systems proposing different types of cooperations based on deep knowledge about the underlying waste chains. We regard this scenario as part of the macro level (in the case that public agencies deliver related recommendations for companies) and on the micro-level, if companies themselves are registered in a public marketplace.\nAchieving sustainability goals in the fashion industry [126] requires, for example, to lower the number of returned deliveries and to increase a customers willingness to accept higher prices for higher-quality items. Such goals can be achieved, for example, by providing means to create bundles of items [59], [124] which fit together relieving customers from the burden of performing this task on their own [131]. In this context, persuasive explanations are needed that help to better motivate customers to choose more sustainable options [53]. An important aspect is also to assure solution minimality, i.e., to guarantee that product bundles and complex configurations do not entail unnecessary components [119]."}, {"title": "M. Climate Action", "content": "The major related challenge is to perform actions with the goal to combat climate change and direct or indirect impacts thereof. An important aspect in combating climate change is to empower new types of energy production systems, for example, in terms of prosumer networks where private households can act as solar energy producers and consumers at the same time [43]. Before establishing individual cooperations, it is important to figure out and recommend homogeneous prosumer clusters which then maximize the consumption of the cluster-produced energy and at the same time minimize the consumption of external energy sources. Recommendations in this context can propose specific clusters in a region of consumers [43]. In related energy saving scenarios, persuasive explanations of recommendations play a central role since households should be encouraged to reduce energy consumption in a sustainable fashion. [97] show how such explanations can be designed on the basis of the concepts of framing [113] where those attributes of a decision alternative are highlighted in a recommender user interface which are related to high kWh savings. One simple possibility of \"implementing\u201d framing on the user interface level is to sort recommended items on specific attributes making those items more attractive that score high with regard to that attribute.\nFor example, alternative energy saving measures can be sorted with regard to the amount of kWh savings [97]. These insights regarding the provision of explanations can also be applied in public services provision when informing citizens about potential energy saving measures. Besides the mentioned energy saving scenarios, such persuasive messaging can also be applied in the context of route recommendation scenarios with the goal to encourage users to choose environmental-friendly routes thus contributing to reduce pollution due to carbon emissions [14].\nOn the level of individual households, recommender systems can be applied to assist residents in optimizing energy savings. Supporting such optimizations, is a central capability of constraint-based recommender systems [37] which allow the inclusion of optimization criteria to determine relevant recommendation candidates [74]. If, for example, power suppliers, support time-dependent flexible pricing conditions, the operation of electric equipment should be optimized on the basis of the pricing models. Furthermore, such constraint-based applications can take into account corresponding regional weather forecasts and conditions to also take into account potential consumptions of energy produced by the household itself thus supporting real-time recommendations and corresponding actions in terms of activating and deactivating a specific heating equipment [28]. An important aspect is also that the recommender has knowledge about the current in-building location of residents. Using such knowledge, can help to further decrease power consumption in buildings by activating/deactivating electronic equipment in an intelligent fashion [123]."}, {"title": "N.

Due to limited resources in terms of possible data collections and available datasets, machine learning models need to be developed that serve as a basis for pollution prediction but also the determination of recommendations of relevant countermeasures [128].

Crop recommender systems recommend crops on the basis of land quality and mineral requirements whereas pesticide recommender systems propose a collection of pesticides in order to protect specific crops from diseases [77], [114]. In the line of sustainability requirements, such systems have to take into account impacts of potentially used treatments (e.g., pesticides), i.e., not solely focusing on maximizing productivity but trying to keep soil characteristics are extremely important for maintaining fertility [114]. In a broader sense, recommender systems can be applied to support different kinds of precision farming [86], [104], [121].\nFurthermore, recommender systems can provide suggestions on how to counteract wildlife poaching which is a serious extinction threat to many animal species and related ecosystems [75]. Based on such tools, animal protectors are enabled to analyze and predict poaching activities and to recommend countermeasures on the basis of behavioral models learning from poaching data [75], [129].

OPEN RESEARCH ISSUES", "content": "Evaluation Metrics for Sustainability. There exists a plethora of evaluation metrics for recommender systems [130] ranging from (1) data-driven approaches to evaluate the prediction/classification quality, (2) experimental settings evaluating prototype systems with alternative variants of user interfaces and algorithmic approaches, and (3) field studies in real-world settings, for example, on the basis of A/B testing. However, existing evaluation metrics do not focus on specific sustainability aspects, for example, achievements in terms of reduced power consumption, increased share of sustainable items in a user's purchase history, and reduced global CO2 footprint \u2013 a specific related aspect is to take sustainability aspects into account when selecting and/or implementing recommendation algorithms [56], [95].\nNudging for Sustainability. The way decision alternatives are presented to users has an impact on the final decisions taken by users. In this context, nudging [103] can be defined as any aspect of a choice situation that alters the behavior of a user in a predicable way without forbidding any options. Providing a basis for better choice on the basis of decision support is an important goal to be taken into account [55]. Related research already indicates the potential of nudges in various recommender systems supporting sustainability goals [15], [50], [57], [67]. Successful nudges are often based on decision biases, i.e., decision practices (heuristics) used by humans to often lead to suboptimal decision outcomes. An overview of such decision biases and their role in recommender systems is discussed in [25], [58], [69], [109].\nContextual Explanations. Given an infrastructure of intelligent data collection, energy consumption information is directly available and can be used for generating corresponding recommendations. For example, in smart homes the activation of a dishwasher and a washing machine could be delayed due to the fact that a parallel car battery recharging would lead to an additional consumption of external energy resources. In travel scenarios, a recommender system can detect alternative (more sustainable) routes not requiring a car rental. In such"}, {"title": "V.

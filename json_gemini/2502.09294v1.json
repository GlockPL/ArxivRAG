These models are typically constructed using supervised machine-learning algorithms, which rely heavily on labeled training datasets. In this position paper, we posit that all AAP training data are derived from human Affective Interpretation Processes (AIPs resulting in a form of Affective Meaning. Research on human affect indicates a form of complexity that is fundamental to such meaning: it can possess what we refer to here broadly as Qualities of Indeterminacy (QIs)-encompassing Subjectivity (meaning depends on who is making the interpretation), Uncertainty (there is a lack of confidence regarding its correctness), Ambiguity (meaning can contain mutually exclusive concepts) and Vagueness (meaning can be situated at different levels in a nested hierarchy). Failing to appropriately consider QIs in AAP leads to results incapable of meaningful and reliable predictions in real-world settings. Based on this premise, our core argument is that a crucial step in adequately addressing indeterminacy in AAP is the development of data collection practices for modeling corpora that involve the systematic consideration of 1) a relevant set of QIs, and 2) context for the associated interpretation processes. To this end, we are 1) outlining a conceptual model of AIPs and the QIs associated with the meaning these produce, in addition to a conceptual structure of relevant context, supporting understanding of its role. Finally, we use our framework for 2) discussing examples of context-sensitivity-related challenges for addressing QIs in data collection setups. We believe our efforts can stimulate a structured discussion of both the role of aspects of indeterminacy and context in research on AAP, informing the development of better practices for data collection and analysis.\nIndex Terms-Affective Computing, Ambiguity, Subjectivity, Context-awareness, User-modeling, Date Collection", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "One of the main goals in Affective Computing research\nis Automatic Affect Prediction (AAP) \u2013 providing computers\nwith a human-like ability to detect or anticipate affective\nstates from multi-modal sensor data [1]. Such technology\nhas been envisioned for applications in a broad range of\ndomains, including intelligent adaptation and personalization\n(e.g., in entertainment [2], [3]), transformation of mental health\nresearch [4] and understanding consumer behavior [5].\nTypically, Automatic Affect Prediction (AAP) technology\nincludes using computational analysis of input data e.g.,\ntext, speech, images, and physiological signals to predict\nvarious affective states (e.g., emotions or moods) in individuals\nor groups [6]. These models are generally built using super-\nvised machine learning algorithms that significantly depend on\nlabelled training datasets [6]. Such corpora of training data are\noften publicly released to the community to support modeling\nefforts (e.g., [6], [7]) and are acknowledged as essential for\nthe field's advances [8].\nCreating labels for these datasets can take different forms,\ndepending on the precise prediction task. However, most\nof them involve humans providing some form of affective\ninterpretation, where selected individuals are asked to either\nmanually annotate relevant sensor data (e.g., [9], [10]) or self-\nreport their impressions of how they feel (e.g., [11]). The\nmeaning of these interpretations can then serve as a label\nfor supervision and, as such, the target of any predictions. In\nthis discussion, we will refer to these acts of interpretation\ngenerically as Affective Interpretation Processes (AIPs) of\nsome specific Target Stimulus (TS) w.r.t. some affect-related\nInformation Goal, while acknowledging that a plethora of\nAffective Science literature provides nuanced discussions of\ndifferent forms of such interpretation processes\u00b9. This allows\nus to describe settings commonly captured in modelling cor-\npora, e.g., where people provide emotional self-reports [11] or\nlabel emotions for individuals depicted in media [14].\nWhile the availability of ever-larger datasets containing such\nlabels has resulted in demonstrable technological progress over\nthe years (e.g., [15]), these often present an overly simplified\npicture of the meaning carried by the human interpretation\nprocesses [16]. This simplification can inhibit AAP predictions\nfrom accurately capturing key aspects of human emotional\nfunctioning [17], [18]. In particular, we believe that meaning,\nas generated by AIPs, is defined by a set of inherent Qualities\nof Indeterminacy (QIs), encompassing at least subjectivity (i.e.,\nits form depends heavily on who is making the interpreta-\ntion); ambiguity (what is being interpreted can have multiple\nplausible meanings simultaneously); uncertainty (the correct\nmeaning is unclear to the interpreter), and vagueness (meaning\ncan be situated at different levels in a nested hierarchy).\nThe varying presence of these qualities in affective meaning\nis a fundamental part of human affective interpretations (e.g.,"}, {"title": "II.

Affective Meaning and Qualities of Indeterminacy", "content": "Affective Meaning: refers to the phenomenological content\nof Interpretation, i.e., the thoughts and feelings associated\nwith it as they are consciously experienced. It is a complex\nphenomenon involving a detailed mental structure that dy-\nnamically changes, depending on the specific interpretation\nundertaken [12]. In AAP tasks, qualities of meaning are\nmostly captured by different categories in taxonomies or other\nrepresentation schemes used for labeling (e.g., labels for Basic\nEmotions ([25])). We believe that certain qualities of Affective\nMeaning have not yet been adequately considered in AAP.\nQualities of Indeterminacy (QIs): describe a series of\ninherent characteristics of Affective Meaning, contributing to\nits variability, complexity, and interpretative diversity. These\nqualities capture the multifaceted and fluid nature of human\nemotional responses and interpretations, making their meaning\nless straightforward, predictable, or universally agreed upon.\nFor this article, we identify four specific qualities that we deem\nimportant for improving AAP:\n\u2022 Subjectivity denotes an essential quality of any form of\nAffective Meaning and is at the heart of many psycho-\nlogical theories of emotional functioning (e.g., Appraisal"}, {"title": "C. Context Aspects", "content": "When talking about context, it is essential to clearly define\nwhatever entity should be contextualized first, i.e., context\nshould always be understood as Context-for. For the present\ndiscussion, we are interested in Context-for any of the com-\nponents of the AIPs, which we have outlined above. Conse-\nquently, we adopt the following working definition: Context\nis any element associated with any of AIP Component that\ninfluence properties of the Affective Meaning.\nHere, we briefly describe different Context Aspects related\nto the presented AIP components and relevant QIs.\n1) Interpreter Context: refers to the interpreters' personal\nbackground that can influence the Affective Meaning of the\nInterpretation. In essence, this type of context is the fundamen-\ntal driving force of Subjectivity, defining how the interpreter's\nidentity is reflected in the meaning. Psychology has identified\nnumerous aspects constituting such context [22]). Examples\nrange from interpreters' personal knowledge, dispositional\ntraits, and emotional states (e.g., mood), among many others.\nHowever, there are also indications that individual differences\ncan shape other QIs, such as Vagueness [32].\n2) Target Stimulus Context: refers to additional informa-\ntion involved in processing the Target Stimulus. This informa-\ntion can come from various sources, such as the observable\nenvironment in which a visual stimulus is embedded in (e.g.,\nthe surrounding scene in an image). Existing findings make\nit plausible to assume that the QIs of Uncertainty, Vagueness,\nand Ambiguity could be strongly impacted by variables falling\nunder this context aspect ( [13], [31], [33]).\n3) Processing Context: refers to any characteristics influ-\nencing Processing and resulting in changes to the Interpre-\ntation and its Affective Meaning. These could be qualitative\ndifferences in how processing takes place (e.g., conscious\ndeliberation or largely automatic) or how it was triggered (e.g.,\nself-initiated or prompted). We believe that Processing Context\ncan be connected to all QIs [34], [35].\n4) Conceptual Context: refers to the theoretical frame-\nwork or conceptual model held by a person, shaping the\ncontent of the Affective Meaning by putting constraints on the\nspace of possible formation and communication of meaning.\nFormal theoretical frameworks are often explicitly used in\ndata collection to represent affective meaning (e.g., categories\nof Basic Emotions [25]). These frameworks can also more\nfundamentally be grounded in different languages or cultural\nbackgrounds [36]. Following this, prior literature indicates that\nthere is a relationship between Conceptual Context, Vague-\nness, Uncertainty, and Subjectivity (see, e.g., [23], [37], [38])."}, {"title": "III. CONTEXT CONFIGURATIONS AS CHALLENGES FOR\nDATA COLLECTION", "content": "AIPs' context-sensitivity implies that contextual influences\nare always active in interpretation processes, constantly shap-\ning the resulting affective meaning. However, the strength of\nany particular influence may vary. We clarify this notion by\nintroducing two different concepts when discussing contextual\ninfluences: 1) a hierarchical Context Structure of nested vari-\nables of which our Context Aspects are a high-level instantia-\ntion and 2) a set of Context Configurations. These configura-\ntions define the specific values that the context variables in the\nContext Structure take from moment to moment, ultimately\nshaping the outcome of any specific AIP. For example, in\nan AIP focusing on interpreting Facial Expressions, Gestures\ncould be a variable that is part of the Context Structure\n(Target Stimulus Context). When an actual AIP takes place, a\nspecific facial expression will form the Target Stimulus, and\nthe Context Configuration will contain a specific gesture."}, {"title": "A. Context Configurations: Phenomenon and Measurement", "content": "Building on the notion of Context Configurations above,\nwe outline how it relates to the design of data collection\nprocedures. We define two types of Context Configurations\nthat can pertain to any particular instance of an AIP:"}, {"title": "B. The Influence of Measurement Configurations: Examples", "content": "Context Configurations can significantly impact the pres-\nence and form of QIs [13], [20], [30]. Therefore, it is important\nfor researchers to be aware of the Context Structure and\nunderstand how Measurement Configurations relate or diverge\nfrom Phenomenon Configurations to make informed decisions\nduring the design stage of the dataset collection. When es-\ntablishing their Measurement Configurations, researchers must\nexercise caution and consider how these setups might differ\nfrom Phenomenon configurations, as such divergences can\ninfluence the QIs. Our proposed model helps identify such\nrelations and potential divergences. Getting as close as possible\nto the Phenomenon Configuration would involve minimizing\nany design or intervention. In practice, data collection in-\nvolves trade-offs between fidelity and representativeness. To\ndemonstrate, we offer examples of how some existing practices\ncould represent Measurement Configurations of relevant AIP\ncontexts and potentially impact specific QIs (\u2192).\n1) Participant Selection sets Interpreter Context \u2192 Sub-\njectivity: Selecting a group of participants with specific at-\ntributes (e.g., age [39], gender [39], or personality [40]) for\ninterpreting media content can set the Interpreter Context of an\nAIP in a particular way, potentially influencing the resulting\nAffective Meaning (Subjectivity). Conversely, by using a more\nhomogeneous or heterogeneous pool of annotators, researchers\ncan change the range of Interpreter Context and its effect on\nthe Subjectivity manifested in the sample. Especially, if the\nsample does not align with what would constitute a relevant\nPhenomenon Context for where an AAP is expected to be\ndeployed, this could lead to misaligned predictions. Therefore,\nthe composition of annotators should be carefully considered\nin data collection and documented in related publications.\n2) Questionnaire Content specifies Conceptual and Pro-\ncessing Context \u2192 (Uncertainty, Ambiguity, Vagueness):\nSelecting specific questionnaires to capture the affective mean-\ning of an interpretation can set its boundaries. The choice\nof wording in a questionnaire sets the driving information\ngoal (e.g., self-report of one's emotional experience), alters\nthe content of the affective meaning through the type of\nquestions used (e.g., open-ended vs. closed), and can provide\na conceptual frame (e.g., answers need to be given in terms\nof Ekman's Basic Emotions [25]). Consequently, these factors\ncan affect the level of vagueness, uncertainty, and ambiguity\nin the AIPs. Thus, the state of the questionnaires' structure\nshould be considered during the dataset-designing process and\nshould be properly documented.\n3) Timing of Questionnaire Provision defines Process-\ning Context\u2192 Vagueness: Temporal distance between the\nmoment at which emotional self-report is asked for and the\noccurrence of a stimulus could also influence processing and\nconsequently influence Affective Meaning [34]. For exam-\nple, asking very quickly after a stimulus (e.g., part of the\nMeasurement Configuration) could artificially prevent Process-\ning from converging on a more specific Affective Meaning\n(Vagueness) than under natural circumstances (Phenomenon\nConfiguration). Thus, the timing of label provision should be\nconsidered when selecting annotation procedures."}, {"title": "IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "Annotated data is essential for developing machine learning\nmodels for Automatic Affect Prediction (AAP). This article\nargues that any such annotations reflect Affective Meaning\ngenerated by human Affective Interpretation Processes (AIPs),\nwhich are complex and possess Qualities of Indeterminacy\n(QIs) that need to be accounted for in data collection for\nautomatic predictions to be meaningful. Our core argument is\nthat adequately addressing QIs in modeling corpora for AAP\nrequires two crucial steps: 1) identify a set of QIs relevant\nfor AAP and develop methods for capturing them, together\nwith 2) the systematic consideration and documentation of\ncontextual variables for the relevant interpretation processes.\nWe are convinced that the first step is necessary, given that\nresearch in Affective Computing has not yet developed a clear\nvocabulary for what we have dubbed here Indeterminacy and\nits relationship to affective meaning. These are conceptually\nchallenging discussions to have, likely requiring the affective\ncomputing community not only to rethink many dominant\nassumptions about what we (can) capture, but also how we\ngo about modeling it. However, there is a growing awareness\nof the importance of elements like subjectivity in other areas\nof applied machine learning [41] that could prove relevant for\ncross-fertilization. Beyond these conceptual issues, we believe\nthat the second step\nunderstanding the context-sensitivity\nof annotation processes is equally essential. Current AAP\nresearch largely lacks any clarity and data on how different\nvarying conditions influence annotations or what impact this\nhas on automatic predictions. As we have argued, indetermi-\nnacy captured by modeling corpora can give rise to structurally\nmisaligned [17] or unreliable predictions [18], [20]. In our\nperspective, context relevant for AIPs shape the specific QIs\npresent as part of Affective Meaning, giving rise to these\nchallenges. Without a clearer picture of how specific changes\nin context shape QIs, we are largely blind to their effect or\nany understanding of the conditions under which AAP may\noperate meaningfully and reliably. Consequently, to advance\nAAP's real-world applicability, we advocate for prioritizing\nthe development of data collection practices that systematically\nconsider context aspects influencing Affective Meaning and its\nIndeterminacy."}, {"title": "ETHICAL IMPACT STATEMENT", "content": "This is a purely theoretical paper that provides an argument\nfor adopting particular practices in specific Affective Com-\nputing Research.

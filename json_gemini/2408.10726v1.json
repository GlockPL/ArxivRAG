Con-\nsequently, a sequence of n bits can represent 2n unique\nvalues, with the bit register being in only one of these\n2n possible states. A quantum bit (qubit) is the quan-\ntum analog of a bit and can assume the two basic states\n|0) = (1) and 1) = (\u0967). Qubits adhere to the princi-\nples of quantum mechanics and can be implemented\nusing various physical systems, such as the spin states\nof subatomic particles, ion traps, neutral atoms, or su-\nperconducting circuits.\nOne of the intriguing properties of qubits is their ability\nto exist not just in the state |0) or (1) but in a super-\nposition of both. An arbitrary single-qubit state can be\nexpressed as:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}$,\n(1)\nwhere the coefficients a and \u1e9e are complex numbers\nthat satisfy the normalization condition |a|2+|3|2 = 1.\nA visual representation of a qubit is shown in Figure\n2.

The state\n\u03c8) \u2192 [Co, C1,\u2026\u2026,CN-1]t possesses N = 2n complex\namplitudes, whose absolute squared values must sum\nto one. Thus, due to the principle of superposition, an\nn-qubit system is capable of encoding information that\nscales as 2n, while classical systems are limited to n. A\nmulti-qubit state is entangled if the states of its compo-\nnent qubits cannot be described independently of each\nother as a tensor product. Quantum entanglement al-\nlows for non-local correlations such that operating on\none component qubit changes the states of others in-\nstantaneously and independent of their separate loca-\ntions; a prominent example are the entangled 2-qubit\nBell states.\nIn order for computation to be possible, there must be a\nway to manipulate quantum states. This is achieved by\noperators that describe the evolution of a closed quan-\ntum system with unitary. In order to preserve the nor-\nmalitation, these have to be unitary, and therefore re-\nversible, that is, for a quantum operator U must hold\nthat U+U = I. In fact, any operation on qubits can be\ndescribed as a matrix operator. Notice that this is fun-\ndamentally different from classical computing, where\noperations are not required to be unitary and not even\nreversible.\nAnother crucial difference between classical and quan-\ntum computation is how information can be accessed\nafter processing. In classical computing, the state of\neach bit is well-defined and can be directly observed at\nany time, revealing whether it is in a state of 0 or 1.\nThis observation does not alter the state of the bits,\nallowing us to access the exact information stored in\nthe system without any disturbance. However, as men-\ntioned above, in quantum systems the state of a qubit\nis generally a superposition of multiple states, mean-\ning it can exist in a combination of both 0 and 1 si-\nmultaneously. To extract information from a quantum\nsystem, one must measure an observable physical quan-\ntity which from now on we assume to be the binary\nnumber associated with the computational basis states.\nThis measurement process forces the quantum system\nto collapse from its superposition into one of the pos-\nsible definite states.

This process is\ndesigned to encode the solution to a given computa-\ntional problem into this ground state, and AQC theo-\nretically possesses the capability to perform any quan-\ntum computation, rendering it a universal approach to\nquantum computing.

Automated planning methods in AI can be\ndivided into online and offline planning each with cer-\ntainty or under uncertainty. Offline planning is decou-\npled from the subsequent execution of produced plans\nand gets no feedback about it during planning, while\nonline planning is interleaved with a controlled action\nexecution in a closed-loop manner. In many real-world\napplications, action planning under uncertainty is re-\nquired that allows for actions with non-deterministic\neffects and incomplete initial states caused by only par-\ntial observability of the environment such as in partially\nobservable Markov decision processes (POMDP). De-\npending on the chosen technique of planning with cer-\ntainty or under uncertainty, a plan can take the form\nof, for example, a finite sequence of primitive actions,\na conditional action plan, or an action policy on be-\nlief states with maximal expected utility. For a more\ncomprehensive introduction to automated planning, we\nrefer the interested reader to, for example, [70].\nIn any case, automated planning methods in AI are\nknown to be computationally expensive, such as clas-\nsical (state-space or planning graph-based) action plan-\nning already being PSPACE-complete, while belief states\nin POMDPs and non-determinism as well as interactive\nPOMDPs make it even worse exponentially.

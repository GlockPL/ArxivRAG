INTRODUCTION", "content": "MAGE semantic segmentation is a crucial perception task in intelligent transportation system [1]\u2013[6], facilitating various downstream tasks such as drivable area detection, semantic-based simultaneous localization and mapping. Recent years have seen remarkable progress in semantic segmentation, driven by the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and advancements in deep learning. However, deep learning-based semantic segmentation methods require extensive annotated datasets for training, and obtaining pixel-wise labels is costly. For instance, the labor-intensive annotation process takes approximately 1.5 hours for a single Cityscapes image, and up to 3.3 hours for an image captured under adverse weather conditions [7], [8].\nTo reduce the labeling cost, semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have garnered attention in recent years [9]\u2013[11]. These methods use a small amount of labeled data alongside a large amount of unlabeled data to enhance the model's performance [9]\u2013[12]. However, as shown in Figure 1, even with 50% of the data annotated, the performance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods has not yet matched the accuracy of fully supervised methods [10], [11], which is more desirable in practical applications due to its higher precision. One potential reason is that they typically employ simple random sampling for annotating the unlabeled data. This approach overlooks the selection of particularly informative samples that could enhance model training. In this paper, we explore incorporating active learning into semi-supervised semantic segmentation to perform valuable sample selection. Additionally, we introduce domain adaptation and leverage a large amount of annotated source domain data from driving simulators or public datasets to aid training.\nActive learning methods employ a human-in-the-loop mechanism to enhance model performance using a limited amount of annotated data. These methods develop acquisition strategies to select informative samples based on uncertainty sampling, diversity sampling, or a combination of both [13]\u2013[15]. Building on active learning, active domain adaptation (ADA) methods aim to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unseen target domain [15]\u2013[19]. ADA methods leverage the abundance of synthetic data generated from driving simulators to facilitate model training [20]\u2013 [22]. However, the incorporation of ADA into semi-supervised semantic segmentation remains under-explored. Meanwhile, pixel or region-based ADA methods suffer from class imbalance problem [15]. As the labeling budget exceeds a certain"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "A. Semantic Segmentation\nSemantic segmentation is a pivotal perception task in intelligent transportation system [1]\u2013[6]. One category of methods aims at enhancing segmentation accuracy through robust model architectures. For instance, CMX proposes a universal transformer-based cross-modal fusion architecture for RGB-X semantic segmentation [6]. Another category of research focuses on balancing inference speed and model precision. SegTransConv is based on the hybrid architecture of CNN and transformer for real-time semantic segmentation of autonomous vehicles [4]. BiSeNet achieves this balance by integrating a spatial path and a context pathcitebisenet. In our experiments, we adopt the BiSeNet for real-time inference.\nB. Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation\nSemi-supervised semantic segmentation methods aim to improve the segmentation performance using a limited amount of labeled data and a large-scale unlabeled data directly from the target domain. These methods can be mainly divided into two categories: consistency regularization and entropy minimization. Consistency regularization methods enforce the model to produce consistent predictions on unlabeled data under perturbations such as data augmentation, mixed samples, or feature perturbations [11], [24], [25]. Entropy minimization methods focus on assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled target data and using them for self-training, such as in ST++ and USRN [26], [27]. Recently, CorrMatch has used correlation matching to discover more accurate high-confidence regions [28]. Despite making steady progress in recent years, semi-supervised methods still fall short of the accuracy achieved by supervised learning counterparts due to noisy pseudo-labels and a lack of accurate semantic guidance. Additionally, these methods often overlook the utilization of label-rich source domains and the selection of informative samples.\nC. Active Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\nDomain adaptation (DA) methods aim to transfer the knowledge learned from a labeled source domain to a target domain with different distribution. Recent advancements in DA for semantic segmentation primarily focus on unsupervised domain adaptation [29]\u2013[32]. They assume that the target domain has no labeled data and the corresponding performance still lag far behind supervised learning counterparts.\nResearchers have turned to active learning to improve adaptation performance with human annotation. Active learning aims to maximize model performance with limited labeled data by selecting the more valuable samples for annotation [33]. For example, Gao proposes an active and contrastive learning framework for fine-grained off-road semantic segmentation [16]. LabOR introduces a novel point-based annotation strategy with an adaptive human-in-the-loop pixel selector but overlooks the contextual relationships between pixels in an image [34]. RIPU designs a region-based acquisition strategy that uses region impurity and prediction uncertainty to select regions that are uncertain in prediction and diverse in spatial adjacency [15]. Subsequently, D2ADA employs density-aware measurements to acquire label annotations [19]. HALO introduces a hyperbolic radius into the acquisition strategy for more effective data annotation and highlights the class imbalance problem with increasing budget [23].\nCurrent ADA methods for semantic segmentation are dominant by pixel or region-level acquisition strategies. However, these forms are not suitable for human labeling, which may not actually reduce the difficulty and cost of annotation [35]. Moreover, most existing ADA methods neglect the potential of unlabeled data for training, which is available and usually large-scale in driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce active learning into semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods to select informative samples for human annotation and model training. We adopt an image-based acquisition strategy and annotation form to preserve contextual information."}, {"title": "III. METHOD", "content": "A. Preliminaries\n1) Data representation: Let the labeled data in the source domain be denoted as $D_s = \\{(x_s^i, y_s^i)\\}$, where $x_s^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W}$ and $y_s^i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H\\times W}$ present the image and label, H and W are the height and width, respectively. The images in the target domain are initially without annotations and are denoted as $D_u = \\{x_u^i\\}$. After human annotation, the target labeled data is represented as $D_l = \\{(x_l^i, y_l^i)\\}$.\n2) Semi-supervised semantic segmentation: Both $D_s$ and $D_l$ in the target domain are used for model training. For $D_s$, the supervised cross-entropy loss can be applied directly. To utilize the potential of $D_u$, consistency regularization loss, entropy minimization loss or other semi-supervised learning methods can be employed. Denote the model's prediction for $x_u$ as $p_u$, the general loss function for semi-supervised semantic segmentation is defined as follows:\n$L_{semi} = L(p_t^s, y_t^s) + \\lambda L(p_t^u)$\t\t(1)\nwhere $L(p_t^u)$ is the unsupervised loss designed by semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods, $\\lambda$ is the coefficient for loss balancing, $L(p, y)$ is usually the cross-entropy loss:\n$L(p, y) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^C y_{(p,i)} log p_{(p,i)}$\t\t(2)\nwhere N is the number of pixels, C is the number of classes. i is the pixel index, and j is the channel index.\n3) ADA for semantic segmentation: In active learning, part of the samples in $D_u$ are selected for human annotation to obtain the target labeled data $D_l = \\{(x_l^i, y_l^i)\\}$. The selection and annotation are conducted at N active learning trigger epoches $T_{ac} = [T_{a1}, T_{a2},..., T_{aN}]$ to acquire a total of $N_s$ samples. The goal of ADA for semantic segmentation is to leverage $D_s$ and $D_l$ to train a segmentation model that performs well on the target domain. Denote the model's prediction results for $x_s^i$ and $x_l^i$ as $p_s^i$ and $p_l^i$, respectively. The general loss function of ADA for semantic segmentation is defined as follows:\n$L_{active} = L(p_s^i, y_s^i) + L(p_l^i, y_l^i)$\t\t(3)\nwhere $L(p_s^i, y_s^i)$ and $L(p_l^i, y_l^i)$ are usually cross-entropy losses calculated according to Equation (2).\nB. Overall Framework\nThe overall training framework of SS-ADA for semantic segmentation is shown in Figure 2. SS-ADA has three key components: the semi-supervised learning module, the active learning module and the IoU-based class weighting. The semi-supervised learning module is designed to leverage the source labeled data $D_s$, target labeled data $D_l$, and target unlabeled data $D_u$ for model training, fully utilizing the available data, especially the potential of unlabeled target data. The training of the segmentation model is primarily conducted within the semi-supervised module.\nWhen the training epoch reaches the specified $T_{ac}$ rounds, the active learning module is triggered. It evaluates the value", "subsections": [{"title": "C. Semi-supervised Learning Module", "content": "The data used for semi-supervised learning includes source labeled data $D_s$, target labeled and unlabeled data $D_l$ and $D_u$. Since the images from the target domain lack annotations initially, the semi-supervised learning process cannot start directly. Therefore, we uniformly randomly sampled 1% of the target data for human annotation, forming the initial target labeled data pool $D_l$. Optionally, UDA methods can also be utilized for model initialization. Once the active learning module is triggered, a portion of the data in $D_u$ is annotated and added to $D_l$, allowing the model to be trained normally within the semi-supervised learning module.\nFor the labeled images $x_s^i$ and $x_l^i$, they pass through the network and obtain their predictions $p_s^i$ and $p_l^i$. The cross-entropy losses $L(p_s, y_s)$ and $L_l(p_l, y_l)$ are calculated for the predictions and labels according to Equation (2).\nFor the unlabeled images $x_u^i$, we use the weak-to-strong consistency training inspired by [11], [36]. The core idea is to apply different levels of perturbations to the images, including image-level perturbations and feature-level perturbations, ensuring that the model produces consistent predictions for the perturbed image pairs. Denote the weak and strong image perturbations as $g_w$ and $g_s$, respectively. The weak perturbations $g_w$ include random resizing, cropping and random horizontal flipping. The strong perturbations $g_s$ consist of color jitter, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur and Cutmix [25]. Denote the feature perturbation as $g_f$, which refers to applying the Dropout [37] to the features extracted by the encoder.\nIn the \"Image perturb\" step in Figure 2, one instance of $g_w$ and two instances of $g_s$ are applied to $x_u^i$, resulting in $x_w^i, x_s^{i1}$ and $x_s^{i2}$. The corresponding model predictions of these perturbed images are denoted as $p_w^i, p_s^{i1}$ and $p_s^{i2}$, respectively. To construct a broader perturbation space, the feature perturbation $g_f$ is applied to the features of $x_w^i$ extracted by the encoder in the \"Feature perturb\" step in Figure 2, additionally producing the prediction $p_{fp}^i$. Following previous UDA methods [30]\u2013[32], $p_w^i$ is used to generate the pseudo-label $\\hat{y}$ for the unlabeled data based on the confidence threshold $c_t$:\n$\\hat{y} = \\underset{dim=C}{argmax}(p_w^i) [max(p_w^i) > C_t]$\t\t(4)\nwhere $\\underset{dim=C}{argmax}(p_w^i)$ and $max(\\underset{dim=C}{p_w^i})$ denote the prediction and the confidence of the model, respectively. $C_t$ is within the range of [0,1]. The cross-entropy losses $L^u_f(p_{fp}^i, \\hat{y}_u),$"}, {"title": "D. Active Learning Module", "content": "The active learning module is triggered at specified training epochs $T_{ac} = [T_{a1}, T_{a2},...,T_{aN}]$ and select a total of $N_i$ images from the target unlabeled data $D_u$ for manual annotation. These annotated images and labels are then incorporated into the target labeled data $D_l$. In our experiments, the triggering epochs for active learning are set within the first half of the total training epochs. The number of samples needed for annotation is uniformly distributed among these sampling epochs. Specifically, at training epoches $[T_{a1}, T_{a2},..., T_{aN}]$, the active learning module will select unlabeled samples from $D_u$ for manual annotation and update $D_l$.\nThe images from $D_u$ are fed into the trained segmentation model from semi-supervised learning module, and prediction logits $p$ are obtained. Then, the images are ranked and selected based on the acquisition strategy. The acquisition strategy in active learning module is crucial for acquiring the informative samples. In SS-ADA, we adopt the image-based acquisition strategy, which is more suitable for manual labeling than pxiel and region-based ones, as shown in Figure 3. The value of the image is evaluated based on the model's uncertainty. We use classic metrics such as entropy and confidence to assess the uncertainty of the model's predictions. The image-level entropy $Ent(p)$ and confidence $Con(p)$ are defined as:\n$Ent(p) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^C p_{(i,j)}log(p_{(i,j)})$\t\t(6)\n$Con(p) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N max_{dim=C} (p_i)$\t\t(7)\nwhere p presents the prediction logits after applying softmax, with the shape of (C, H, W). C is the number of classes, H and W are the height and width of the image, and N is the number of pixel. The image-level entropy and confidence are calculated by averaging the pixel-level entropy and confidence of the predictions. If $Ent(p)$ is used as the acquisition strategy, the images with the highest entropy are selected. If $Con(p)$ is used, the images with the lowest confidence are selected. The selected images are annotated by humans and added to $D_l$."}, {"title": "E. IoU-based Class Weighting", "content": "To alleviate the class imbalance problem in the target domain, we design a class weighting strategy based on the IoU of labeled data in the target domain $D_l$, obtained from the active learning module. It adjusts the weights of each class in the loss function during training, assigning higher weights to classes with lower IoU and vice versa. Previous methods typically calculate weights based on class frequency:\n$F = \\frac{N_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^C N_i}$\t\t(8)\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of pixels of class $i$, and C is the number of classes. We calculate the frequency of each class using the ground truth of the Cityscapes validation set, and the IoU of the semi-supervised learning method UniMatch [11] with 25% target labeled data in the GTA5-to-Cityscapes task, as shown in Figure 4. We observed that some classes, such as traffic signs and people, despite having low class frequencies, achieve relatively good class IoU (above 72%). On the other hand, classes like trucks and trains have both low class frequencies and low IoU (below 60%), thus requiring higher weights. This observation motivated us to calculate class weights based on IoU.\nSpecifically, after the active learning module is triggered at specified epochs and $D_l$ is updated, the semantic segmentation model makes predictions on the images in $D_l$ and calculates the IoU for each class. Let $x_l^i, y_l^i$ and $\\hat{y}_l^i$ denote the image from target labeled domain, its prediction and ground truth, respectively. The IoU of each class, i.e., $IoU_i$ is calculated as:\n$IoU_i = \\frac{\\sum I[y_l^i = i, \\hat{y}_l^i = i]}{\\sum I[y_l^i = i] + \\sum I[\\hat{y}_l^i = i] - \\sum I[y_l^i = i, \\hat{y}_l^i = i]}$\t\t(9)\nwhere i is the class index, I is the indicator function, which equals 1 when the condition is satisfied, and 0 otherwise. The loss weight for class i, denoted as $w_i$, is updated as:\n$w_i = (1 - IoU_i) \\times (u - 1) + 1$\t\t(10)\nwhere u is the upper bound of the class weight and is set as 2 in our experiments. The range of the class weight is [1, u] and $w_i$ is incorporated into the loss calculation for $L_s^i$, $L_l^i$, $L_{fp}^i$, $L_w^i$ and $L_s^{i2}$. Take the loss $L_s^i$ as an example, the loss function with the IoU-based class weighting is:\n$L(p) = -\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N \\sum_{j=1}^C w_j y_{(i,j)}log p_s(i,j)$\t\t(11)\nwhere i and j are the pixel and channel indices, N and C are the number of pixels and classes, $w_j$ is the weight for class j."}, {"title": "F.

The characteristics of these datasets, including their type (simulated or real), the count of training and validation sets, resolution, and the number of semantic categories, are summarized in Table I.

Experimental Setup", "content": "For real-time inference and deployment, we adopt BiSeNet [38] as the segmentation model unlike previous methods that use DeepLabV2 or DeeplabV3+ [39]. In the semi-supervised learning module, the training parameters are set following [10], [11]. The model is trained using the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.005, momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 0.0001. A warm-up strategy for the learning rate is employed in the first 1000 iterations, and the batch size is set as 4. For the former three domain adaptation datasets, the images are cropped into (768, 768), while for Cityscapes-to-FishEyeCampus, the images are cropped into (512, 512) during the training process. The total training epochs are set as 240 for GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes, 200 for Cityscapes-to-ACDC, and Cityscapes-to-FishEyeCampus. When reproducing U2PL and UniMatch using BiSeNet as the segmentation model, we adopt the same training parameters following [10], [11]. The active learning module is triggered at 20, 40, and 60 epochs for all datasets. The upper bound of the class weight u is set to 2. The confidence threshold for pseudo-label generation is set to 0 and can be improved by existing self-training methods. To ensure a fair comparison, we also replace the segmentation model in D2ADA [19] and RIPU [15] with BiSeNet and maintain the original training parameters in their respective papers. Our goal is to achieve the accuracy of supervised learning using fewer target labeled samples. We use the entire target domain dataset to perform supervised training with BiSeNet as the target accuracy. Additionally, we include the accuracy obtained from joint training with both source and target domain datasets. The experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU."}, {"title": "D. Quantitative Results and Analysis", "content": "1) GTA5-to-Cityscapes: The quantitative results on GTA5-to-Cityscapes are shown in Table II. When using UniMatch, the mIoU for supervised learning and joint training are 71.0% and 71.5%, respectively. With 25% of labeled data in Cityscapes, SS-ADA achieves 71.3% mIoU, surpassing that of supervised learning. To demonstrate the generalizability, we replace the semi-supervised learning module with U2PL. The mIoU for supervised learning and joint training are 70.1% and 70.5%, respectively. With 25% target labeled data, SS-ADA achieves an mIoU of 72.4%, higher than both.\nIn the first column of Figure 6, we compare the performance of supervised learning, semi-supervised methods and SS-ADA under different ratios of target labeled data. Semi-supervised methods show an improvement in accuracy compared to supervised ones, and as the ratio of labeled data decreases, the absolute improvement becomes more significant, highlighting the benefits of leveraging unlabeled data. However, these methods still fall short of the performance achieved by supervised learning with 100% labeled data. SS-ADA achieves further improvements in accuracy compared to semi-supervised methods. This is made through the use of an acquisition strategy and the inclusion of labeled source domain data. Remarkably, SS-ADA reaches the accuracy level of supervised learning while using only 25% of the target labeled data, significantly reducing the annotation requirements and associated costs.\n2) SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes: The experimental results on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes are shown in Table III. Similarly, SS-ADA achieves the accuracy of supervised learning using 25% of target labeled data but falls short of reaching the performance level of joint training. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that SYNTHIA data has higher quality compared to GTA5, and its distribution is closer to that of Cityscapes. Therefore, joint training tends to yield better performance. From the second column of Figure 6, it's evident that SS-ADA consistently improves the mIoU compared to semi-supervised learning methods across different ratios.\n3) Cityscapes-to-ACDC: Table IV presents the quantitative results on Cityscapes-to-ACDC. When using 12.5% of target labeled data, SS-ADA achieves the accuracy of supervised learning. With 25% of target labeled data, the performance of SS-ADA is comparable to the joint training.

The class frequency distribution of the annotated labels for the images selected in these three rounds is shown in Figure 7. It can be observed that the selected classes have relatively low class frequencies in Cityscapes. After the active learning module, the frequency proportion of these classes is significantly increased, especially during the first selection at epoch 20.

The performance of D2ADA increases initially but then plateaus or even decreases. While RIPU exhibits a noticeable decrease in accuracy, a trend also observed in the literature [23]. This suggests that image-level acquisition strategies are less sensitive to the class imbalance problem, possibly because they preserve rich contextual information within the images. Additionally, as the ratio of annotated data increases, the improvement in mIoU slows down, illustrating the characteristic of active learning in selecting valuable samples. More valuable samples are chosen when the annotation ratio is low, whereas adding redundant samples does not significantly enhance model accuracy."}, {"title": "H.

Across four different annotation ratios, the differences in performance between using entropy and confidence were not significant. Since the overall performance of entropy is slightly better, we adopt it in our experiments.\n3) The impact of active learning trigger epoches $T_{ac}$: We conduct experiments on Cityscapes-to-FishEyeCampus with 12.5% of target labeled data under different $T_{ac}$ and the results are shown in Table VIII. Overall, the impact of different $T_{ac}$ on model accuracy is not particularly significant. Setting the trigger epoches within the first half of the total training epochs yields satisfactory results. As the number of trigger epoches increases from two to four, the average mIoU initially improves and then declines, with three trigger epoches achieving the best performance. In the three-sampling setup, the configuration of sampling at epochs 20, 40, and 60 shows the best results, and we use this setting in our experiments.\n4) The impact of the upper bound of class weight u: We set u to different values and the results on Cityscapes-to-FishEyeCampus with 25% of target labeled data are shown in Figure 13.

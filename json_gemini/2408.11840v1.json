PET-MRI allows for the simultaneous acquisition of both functional and anatomical data [2][3][4][5]. The harmonized nature of PET and MRI data makes PET-MRI an invaluable tool in various neurological studies [6]. Structural, contrast, and resolution are disparities in PET and MRI due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms. Nevertheless, there are statistical correlations between PET and MRI, particularly when PET employs radiotracers like fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) [7]. PET often feature lower signal-to-noise ratios and restricted spatial resolution in visual imaging due to the inherently stochastic nature of photon emission processes [8][9][10][11]. In contrast, MRI offers high spatial resolution in anatomical imaging. However, the k-space data acquisition process is time-consuming. The common method reduces data acquisition time for upsampling. Undersampling k-space data leads to aliasing in the reconstructed images [12]. The joint reconstruction process capitalizes on the complementary information of MRI and PET. Meanwhile, the score-based diffusion model can learn the joint probability distribution of multi-modality image [13]. This study aims to develop a joint reconstruction model that effectively harnesses the complementary information residing within both modalities, thereby significantly enhancing the quality of their respective reconstructions."}, {"title": "Method", "content": "The joint reconstruction can be described as\n\\begin{equation}\nY = D(X) + \\epsilon\n\\end{equation}\nwhere different modalities can be written in stacked form\n\\begin{equation}\nY=\\begin{pmatrix}f\\\\g\\end{pmatrix},D=\\begin{pmatrix}A\\\\F\\end{pmatrix},X=\\begin{pmatrix}u\\\\v\\end{pmatrix},\\epsilon=\\begin{pmatrix}\\varsigma\\\\\\xi\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nLet u and v represent the PET and MRI to be reconstructed, respectively. f corresponds to the observed PET data, and g refers to the observed MRI data. A signifies the PET forward operator as the discrete Radon transform [14]. F stands for the MRI forward operator as the discrete Fourier transform. $\\epsilon$ represents the measured noise. $\\varsigma$ is associated with Gaussian noise, following a normal distribution, i.e., $\\varsigma \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, and $\\xi$ denotes Poisson noise, i.e., $\\xi \\sim P(\\lambda)$. By reasonable assumptions, the separation of the multi-modality likelihood can be described as\n\\begin{equation}\np(f,g|u,v)=p(f|u,v)p(g|u,v)=p(f|u)p(g|v)\n\\end{equation}\nThe posterior probability of the PET-MRI image (u,v) for observed PET-MRI data (f,g) can then be simplified as\n\\begin{equation}\np(u,v|f,g)\\propto p(f|u)p(g|v)p(u,v)\n\\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\nWe further assume a prior of the form $p(u,v)= \\exp(-\\alpha R(u,v))$. Maximizing (1) is equivalent to minimizing\n\\begin{equation}\n\\arg \\min_{u,v} \\left\\{ - \\log p(u,v|f,g) \\right\\}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n= -\\log p(f|u) - \\log p(g|v) + \\alpha R(u,v)\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n= \\sum_i \\left\\{ (Au)_i - f_i \\log (Au)_i \\right\\} + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} || Fv - g ||_2^2 + \\alpha R(u,v)\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $R(u,v) = \\log P(u,v)$. u, v can be reconstructed when $\\log P(u,v)$ was obtained by diffusion model. The proposed model as JR-diffusion comprises of the forward diffusion process and the reverse diffusion process. The forward diffusion process, noise is gradually introduced to convert a complex data distribution into a known prior distribution. It is described as\n\\begin{equation}\n(u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}) = (u_i, v_i) + \\sqrt{\\sigma_{min} \\frac{(\\sigma_{max} - \\sigma_{min})}{N}}^2 z, i=1,2,...,N.\n\\end{equation}\nConversely, in the reverse diffusion process, noise is removed to transform the prior distribution back into the original data distribution. It can obtain the reconstruction result\n\\begin{equation}\n(u_i, v_i)\n= (u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}) - s_\\theta((u_{i+1}, v_{i+1}), t) - A^* [ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i+1}} A^* (A u_{i+1} - f_{i+1}) + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i+1}} F^* (F v_{i+1} - g_{i+1}) + z_i].\n\\end{equation}"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Our training dataset sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [15], consisted of 167 individuals and 5010 image pairs.

To substantiate the efficacy of this supplementary information, MRI contrast results for individual and joint reconstructions are presented in Fig. 4, and PET contrast results are displayed in Fig. 5. A comparison between single reconstruction MRI and joint reconstruction MRI reveals that the absence of complementary information significantly compromises the quality of the reconstruction."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "In this paper, we propose JR-diffusion, a novel model for PET and MRI joint reconstruction. It accurately characterizes the joint distribution, serving as a prior for clean image generation from undersampled data. Numerical experiments confirm JR-diffusion's superior performance in joint reconstruction accuracy compared to tradition imaging and supervised deep learning. The accuracy in learning joint probability distributions of PET and MRI primarily drives this improvement."}]}

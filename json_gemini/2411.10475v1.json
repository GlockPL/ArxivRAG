To assess how artificial intelligence might contribute to avoiding collisions, we need to understand how train drivers do it. What aspects of a situation do they consider when evaluating the risk of collision? In the present study, we assumed that train drivers do not only identify potential obstacles but interpret what they see in order to anticipate how the situation might unfold. However, to date it is unclear how exactly this is accomplished. Therefore, we assessed which cues train drivers use and what inferences they make. To this end, image-based expert interviews were conducted with 33 train drivers. Participants saw images with potential obstacles, rated the risk of collision, and explained their evaluation. Moreover, they were asked how the situation would need to change to decrease or increase collision risk. From their verbal reports, we extracted concepts about the potential obstacles, contexts, or consequences, and assigned these concepts to various categories (e.g., people's identity, location, movement, action, physical features, and mental states). The results revealed that especially for people, train drivers reason about their actions and mental states, and draw relations between concepts to make further inferences. These inferences systematically differ between situations. Our findings emphasise the need to understand train drivers' risk evaluation processes when aiming to enhance the safety of both human and automatic train operation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Although trains have become a relatively safe means of transportation, collisions keep occurring. Their types and frequencies may vary between locations, but they remain a major concern around the world (Ballay et al., 2022; Hampel et al., 2023; Rosi\u0107 et al., 2022; Skl\u00e1dan\u00e1 et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2023). Given the mass and speed of trains, collisions can have disastrous consequences for the people or objects a train is colliding with, the train, the driver, the passengers, and sometimes even for the infrastructure or third parties not directly involved in the accident. Collisions with people are particularly concerning due to the combination of their frequency and severity: people illegally enter railway territory on a regular basis (Skl\u00e1dan\u00e1 et al., 2016) and when they get hit by a train, this usually results in fatalities (Hampel et al., 2023). In the aftermath of such accidents, train drivers have to deal with acute psychological disturbances (Limosin et al., 2006).\nCurrent endeavours to enhance railway safety envision a use of artificial intelligence (AI) to partly or fully automate train operation (ATO). These approaches focus on sensing and identifying potential obstacles to avoid collisions. However, this focus seems overly limited. Imagine a train entering a station. An Al system might classify the objects on the platform as people with high certainty. Does this make the situation dangerous? It depends. In fact, it is normal that people are standing there \u2013 this is what platforms are made for. The relevant question is what they are doing and whether they might get in conflict with the train. In more abstract terms, potential obstacles are omnipresent. To arrive at a valid risk evaluation, it is necessary to infer whether a potential obstacle is likely to become an actual one. Thus, false positives need to be eliminated in order to single out true positives. A challenge is that false and true positives often belong to the same object class. For instance, normal passengers waiting for their train are people in the vicinity of the tracks, just like the infrequent outliers who might enter the danger zone by accident, as a result of a criminal act, or in an attempt to end their lives. Due to a train's long braking distances, there usually is insufficient time to simply wait until the situation gets disambiguated as the train is approaching. Instead, it is necessary to infer how the situation might develop before this development is manifested in concrete, observable events.\nGiven this challenge, the limited focus of contemporary Al research on object identification seems puzzling. In the psychological literature, it has been known for decades that situation awareness requires more than mere identification: to understand dynamic situations, agents (either human or automated) need to interpret what is going on at the moment in order to predict how situations are likely to unfold in the future. In the scenario above, it is necessary to pick up visual cues (e.g., about a person's appearance and behaviour as well as about context factors such as time of day) in order to interpret what is going on (e.g., what the person might be intending) and anticipate how the situation is likely to unfold (e.g., whether the person might enter the danger zone). To help artificial agents establish situation awareness, it would be desirable if Al research could build on psychological knowledge about train drivers' strategies. Surprisingly, many studies with human train drivers have adopted the same limited focus as contemporary Al research: they mainly investigated basic scene perception and object identification. Although task analyses of train driving are aware of the need to interpret and anticipate events, they mainly relate these abilities to route knowledge without specifying how situation awareness can emerge from the visual cues available in a particular situation.\nThe present study contributes to a deeper understanding of how train drivers evaluate the risk of collision. This presupposes a detailed description of what they perceive and infer when processing potential obstacles. To this end, we conducted image-based expert interviews with 33 train drivers, investigating what concepts they use to reason about collisions. Before presenting the details of the"}, {"title": "2 Theoretical background", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Can collisions be avoided by means of AI?", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1.1 Promises and limitations of AI", "content": "Enhancing the safety and efficiency of train operation is an ongoing challenge. In recent years, concepts of Al-based automatic train operation have gained popularity (Flammini et al., 2022). An important sub-challenge of this endeavour is to avoid collisions or reduce the harm resulting from them. To this end, current research efforts mainly focus on obstacle detection and identification (for overviews see Cao et al., 2024; Risti\u0107-Durrant et al., 2021). The respective Al systems rely on data from different sensors (e.g., camera, infrared, LiDAR), process these data with image classifiers based on deep neural networks to identify potential obstacles (e.g., person on the tracks), and then the results can be used to make operational decisions (e.g., braking). However, Al is not perfect and thus there are limits to Al-based collision prediction and avoidance.\nOutside the railway domain, it is well-established that image classifiers can make bizarre mistakes (Firestone, 2020; Geirhos et al., 2020). For instance, they may fail to recognise a cow in an unusual context like a beach (Beery et al., 2018), they typically rely on texture more than shape and thus classify a cat with wrinkled skin as an elephant (Geirhos et al., 2019), and they can get derailed, quite literally, when small patches of pixels are replaced in such a way that humans would not even notice the change (Jacobsen et al., 2019). In the railway domain, such mistakes may be even more likely. This is due to a number of technical challenges. For instance, suitable datasets are scarce, classification performance deteriorates under difficult weather conditions, and small objects or unknown categories are hard to detect (Cao et al., 2024). Not surprisingly, such classification failures and technical issues have raised concerns about the safety of Al systems for collision avoidance (Rosi\u0107 et al., 2022). Much of the corresponding discussion focuses on whether Al will be robust enough in identifying potential obstacles. For instance, can an Al system reliably detect a person near the tracks? Can it distinguish between a shadow and a tree obstructing the tracks?\nAlthough these certainly are relevant questions, we doubt that inaccurate object identification is the problem we should be most concerned about.\u00b9 Additional challenges of automatic train operation have been highlighted in studies identifying the hidden roles of train drivers (Jansson, Fr\u00f6idh, et al., 2023; Jansson, Olsson, et al., 2023; Karvonen et al., 2011). For instance, train drivers need to take care of passengers and flexibly act in exceptional situations. But even if you just focus on driving, and within this task you just single out the avoidance of obstacles \u2013 is their identification the main challenge? We ought to be sceptical about this as the world is full of distractors: things that could pose a threat in principle, but then upon closer inspection turn out not to. If emergency braking was initiated in all of these cases, train operation would get completely inefficient (cf. Rosi\u0107 et al., 2022). A key problem with"}, {"title": "2.1.2 How humans understand complex, dynamic situations", "content": "Understanding complex, dynamic situations has been a subject of psychological research for decades. The concept of situation awareness (Endsley, 1995, 2017) assumes that people grasp dynamic situations on three levels. Perceiving the elements of the current situation only is a first step, which forms the basis for comprehension and projection. That is, people do not only identify what is currently present, but interpret what they see and anticipate how the situation is likely to unfold. This seems particularly relevant in the context of train operation due to the long braking distances and the resulting need to plan ahead (cf. Roth & Multer, 2009). Endsley's three-level model of situation awareness is just one of many psychological theories describing how humans handle complex, dynamic situations. Others, like Neisser's perceptual cycle (Neisser, 1976), Klein's recognition-primed decision making (Klein, 1989) or Rasmussen's decision ladder (Rasmussen, 1986) were proposed long ago and still shape contemporary research (Flach, 2015; Klein, 2008; Lintern, 2010; Plant & Stanton, 2015). They all share the assumption that humans do not merely identify objects but process this low-level information in combination with contextual constraints and prior knowledge to draw inferences. Given that these higher-order processes are common sense in psychology, one might assume that there are plenty of insightful studies spelling out how train drivers process potential obstacles, and their findings could readily be used to inspire Al research. Well, unfortunately not. In the following sections, we will review what is known about train drivers' visual processing strategies, and what is missing to understand how they evaluate the risk of collision."}, {"title": "2.2 How do train drivers process their visual environment?", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.2.1 Train drivers in psychological studies", "content": "One approach of understanding how train drivers process their environment is to monitor their actual behaviour. Train driving imposes high visual demands on drivers (Naweed & Balakrishnan, 2014) and the visual sense is their most important source of information to detect abnormalities (Jansson, Fr\u00f6idh, et al., 2023). Thus, it is not surprising that numerous studies have tracked train drivers' eye movements, either in simulators or out on the tracks (Du et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2015; Itoh et al., 2000; Luke et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2024; Merat et al., 2002; Sun et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2019). These eye movements were found to depend on operational and personal factors. For instance, they differed between urban and rural environments (Guo et al., 2015; Luke et al., 2006) or between high and low speeds (Guo et al., 2015; Itoh et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2019). Moreover, they were affected by train drivers' overall job experience (Du et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2019), their experience with collisions (Ma et al., 2024), and their route knowledge (Itoh et al., 2000). A few studies have zoomed in on the detection of abnormal objects (Itoh et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2024; Suzuki et al., 2019). In these studies, detection performance was measured by having train drivers press a button or hit the brakes as soon as they notice an object. Detection was found to depend on factors such as the speed of the train, the curvature of the tracks, and train drivers' collision experience.\nThere is a critical limitation common to almost all behavioural studies investigating train drivers' visual strategies: they did not go beyond the processing of low-level aspects like location and identity. In that"}, {"title": "2.2.2 What visual cues do train drivers use?", "content": "When describing their work in challenging situations, most train drivers emphasise the need to manage the density of information coming in from the environment (Naweed & Balakrishnan, 2014). Some studies have extracted the visual cues train drivers pick up during normal operation (Luke et al., 2006; Roth & Multer, 2009). First, train drivers monitor specific objects and events. That is, they attend to the locations of agents (e.g., other trains, workers, trespassers) and other potential hazards. Aside from that, they consider the broader context. Thus, a second type of cue refers to environmental constraints such as the weather and sight-related factors (e.g., fog, darkness). Third, train drivers keep track of the infrastructure, considering both fixed physical elements (e.g., bridges, tunnels, stations) and dynamic physical elements (e.g., construction sites). Fourth, they are constantly aware of relevant operational aspects (e.g., their current location and speed, signals, train characteristics).\nTwo studies specifically focused on potential collisions and described what cues train drivers use in these situations. First, Rosi\u0107 et al. (2022) interviewed 68 train drivers to assess the type and frequency of different obstacles. In their discussion, they briefly mentioned which features of these obstacles were used by train drivers to evaluate the risk of collision. Such cues included the obstacle's distance, position, movement, and physical features. The latter was illustrated by stating that the risk associated with a cardboard box depended on its size, position, and content. Furthermore, train drivers considered the type of train as it affects the impact of collisions. For people, it was mentioned that train drivers attended to their body language Unfortunately, these cues were not reported in a systematic manner.\nIn another study that reported cues used by train drivers to reason about potential collisions, Tichon (2007) conducted focus group interviews using the critical decision method (an interview technique suitable for eliciting the details of exceptional situations). However, only one to six cues per incident were reported, and often they simply described the basic type of situation (e.g., \u201cchildren crossing tracks before tunnel entrance\"). Interestingly, several cues did not only identify potential obstacles but included the broader context. In particular, train drivers considered their current activity (e.g., approaching or leaving a station) as well as the signals and warnings they received (e.g., encountering railway detonators, warning via signals, receipt of information about track conditions). Taken together, it seems like train drivers use a variety of cues beyond the mere identity of potential obstacles. However, previous studies did not provide sufficiently detailed accounts of these cues."}, {"title": "2.2.3 How do train drivers interpret the cues they pick up?", "content": "The literature base is thin regarding the cues train drivers use, but it is even thinner regarding their interpretations. Based on the available studies, one might conclude that once an object or event is detected, the situation is clear - after all, previous studies typically did not discuss how train drivers infer whether the things they see actually pose a threat. However, there are a few exceptions.\nFirst, in interviews with metro drivers, Karvonen et al. (2011) determined train drivers need to interpret and evaluate risks, for instance when a person at a station looks abnormal. Unfortunately, the authors just mentioned such interpretations anecdotally but did not investigate how drivers make them. Still, their anecdotal evidence is interesting, for instance when they listed examples of people who need to be monitored with special care. This need for enhanced monitoring depended on people's identity (e.g., children), behaviour (e.g., standing in the danger zone), interaction with objects (e.g., skateboards, wheelchairs), and on the inferences drivers derived from these visual cues (e.g., visually impaired, drunk, acting in a threatening way). These examples suggest that drivers go well beyond simply identifying an obstacle but interpret its behaviour and appearance to draw further conclusions.\nA second exception stems from the study mentioned above that assessed collision frequencies (Rosi\u0107 et al., 2022). In their discussion, the authors provided examples for inferences train drivers derived from a potential obstacle's identity. For instance, in case of track workers, train drivers inferred that these are professionals that are trained and medically fit to move out of the way. Accordingly, workers may be closer to the tracks than ordinary people, without train drivers getting overly concerned. Conversely, children or people with special needs are inferred to pose a higher risk.\nFinally, some studies argued that train drivers infer people's mental states, for instance when considering what people can see at level crossings (Roth & Multer, 2009). Taken together, while the available evidence suggests that train drivers interpret situations, previous studies only reported such interpretations in the form of examples."}, {"title": "2.2.4 How do train drivers anticipate future events?", "content": "The available evidence also suggests that train drivers actively anticipate how a situation might unfold. For instance, they generate anticipations of movement authority, infrastructure, and human behaviour (Naghiyev et al., 2016). Although numerous studies stressed the importance of anticipation (Karvonen et al., 2011; McLeod et al., 2005; Naghiyev et al., 2016; Naweed, 2014; Phillips & Sagberg, 2014; Zoer et al., 2014), few of them specified what exactly these anticipations referred to and how they were generated. A notable exception is the task analysis by Roth and Multer (2009), which put a strong focus on looking ahead and planning. In fact, they concluded that the majority of train drivers' attention is focused on anticipating what is likely to happen next. Based on this anticipation, train drivers monitor their environment: knowing what to expect allows them to quickly direct their attention to events that are out of the ordinary (i.e., pattern matching).\nIn previous studies, it has not always been clear what train drivers' anticipations are based on. Some exclusively portrayed anticipations as a consequence of route knowledge (McLeod et al., 2005; Naghiyev et al., 2016), while others related it to the interplay between route knowledge and monitoring (Naweed, 2014; Roth & Multer, 2009). Only few explicitly linked anticipation to specific cues observed in the current situation (Tichon, 2007). For instance, based on railway detonators, train drivers predicted that workers are present further down the tracks. Based on children trespassing,"}, {"title": "2.3 Present study", "content": "To infer how Al should assess the risk of collision, it is desirable to know how train drivers generate situation awareness. Similar to contemporary Al research, most behavioural studies of train driving adopted a narrow focus on eye movements and object detection. Their results tell us where train drivers look and what hazards they notice, but not how they use this information to evaluate the risk of collision. Conversely, most cognitive task analyses were quite broad in their focus, and few of them addressed potential collisions. Some described the cues train drivers use, and some even tackled interpretation and anticipation. However, these accounts were usually restricted to anecdotal evidence based on a few examples. In the present study, we aimed to better understand how train drivers evaluate the risk of collision.\nTo specify our research question, we first conducted a pilot study with six train drivers. In an unstructured interview, they described their experiences with obstacles (including collisions and near misses) and we asked a variety of questions about these situations. In line with previous research, we found that uncertainty and anticipation played a major role. To enable anticipation, train drivers drew inferences from features of the obstacle and context, while also considering the interactions between these cues. Moreover, the pilot study revealed another major source of anticipation that had not been as prominent in previous research: the presumed intentions of people, which train drivers inferred from various observable cues such as a person's identity or body language.\nIn the main study, we specifically investigated what cues train drivers use and how they integrate them. Based on the pilot study and the available literature, we expected train drivers to rely on higher-level inferences when evaluating the risk of collision. That is, we hypothesised that they would not only use features that are in the focus of contemporary Al research, such as an obstacle's identity, its location, or its movement. Rather, and especially when evaluating the risk associated with people, we expected train drivers to rely on non-observable concepts. This might be abstract descriptions of people's actions (i.e., behaviour with meaning), inferences about their mental states (e.g., perception, knowledge, intentions), or anticipations of future events (e.g., entering the tracks). In sum, we expected train drivers to go beyond what is currently visible when evaluating the risk of collision.\nWhen speaking about inferences, we need to acknowledge that most of experts' risk evaluation proceeds implicitly (Klein, 1989, 2008): based on a rapid recognition of familiar patterns, they intuitively categorise situations, instead of pondering about the contributing factors and their relations. Therefore, we needed a knowledge elicitation technique that relies on concrete situations instead of abstract reasoning. At the same time, these situations should not provide too many cues about their dynamics in order to keep experts from making a quick, implicit judgment that they may"}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Data availability", "content": "All stimuli, instructions, transcripts, coding tables, relation graphs, aggregated data, and syntax files are made available via the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/fcwgj/"}, {"title": "3.2 Participants", "content": "Thirty-tree train drivers took part in the study.

We aimed to create a diverse stimulus set that is suitable to elicit a variety of relevant factors.

Based on these interviews, we gathered an initial selection of images and tested it with an experienced train driver. Based on his comments, we discarded some images and added others, leading to a final selection of fifteen images. A description of their contents is provided in Table 1.\nThe images varied on several dimensions. First, the potential obstacles in focus were either people (8 images), objects (4 images), or both (3 images). People varied in several features such as their identity (e.g., pedestrians, children, track workers), proximity to the tracks (e.g., on, next to, far away), and actions (e.g., waiting for the train, leaving the tracks, playing). Objects additionally showed considerable variation in their physical features (e.g., size, mass). Furthermore, the images varied in numerous context factors such as the type of railway area (e.g., station, shunting yard, branch line, main line) and other aspects of their infrastructure (e.g., curvature, state of the tracks, foliage, fencing) or natural environment (e.g., weather, time of day). In terms of more abstract features, the images varied in their complexity (i.e., number of hazardous elements to consider) and presumed riskiness (i.e., everyday scenes, situations in which collisions were imminent)."}, {"title": "3.4 Procedure", "content": "An overview of the procedure is provided in Figure 2. The interviews were conducted by the first author (RM), while the second author (JS) took notes. At the start of an interview, demographic information was collected unless train drivers had already participated in the pilot study.

For each image, they had to answer five questions: (1) How dangerous is the situation? (2) Why? (3) What would make the situation less dangerous? (4) What would make the situation more dangerous? and (5) How ambiguous is the situation?"}, {"title": "3.5 Data analysis", "content": "All interviews were transcribed according to the five questions asked for each image. We excluded information that was not relevant to the study (e.g., comments about politics, private information) and to ensure anonymity, we cleared the transcripts of all information that might identify the participant (e.g., names of locations). The transcripts were then used to code the concepts that train drivers used to evaluate collision risk. To this end, all risk-relevant statements were highlighted in the transcripts. These statements could be factual or counterfactual (i.e., present or absent in the situation). They included observable cues (e.g., person is close to the tracks, person does not wear safety vest, weather could be rainy) as well as non-observable concepts like people's mental states (e.g., person cannot hear the train). Statements about the train driver's mental states were coded but excluded from the data analysis (e.g., I would see the person in time, I do not know what the person is doing). Statements about the train driver's actions were not coded (e.g., I would operate the whistle, I would brake).\nAfter train drivers' statements were highlighted in the transcripts, they were transferred to a tabular format (one table per image). Each column represented a train driver and each row represented a concept. A concept was defined as a prototypical statement subsuming all statements with identical content but minor differences in formulation. This resulted in 237 to 574 distinct concepts per image (not including concepts about train drivers' mental states). However, it is somewhat subjective whether to code two statements as referring to the same or two different concepts. Therefore, the unit of analyses will not be individual concepts but clusters of concepts.\nTo derive these clusters, the concepts were structured into factors, subfactors and fine-grained categories. This structure was not predefined but emerged from the data in a bottom-up manner based on a qualitative content analysis. On the highest level, eight factors were extracted.

When discussing people, most statements referred to their Identity (9.6%). Moreover, train drivers relied on other observable cues like Location (6.9 %), Movement (5.9 %), and Physical Features (4.9 %). In addition to these observable cues, they reasoned about people's abstract Actions (5.2%), thus assigning meaning to what these people are doing. Interestingly, Mental States (7.1%) were used more often than any other subfactor besides Identity. Apparently, interpreting what might go on inside people's heads seemed almost as relevant as who they are, and more relevant than where they are, what they do, or what they look like. In contrast, when train drivers discussed the risk associated with objects or animals, statements about Identity (7.8%) clearly dominated all other subfactors. Thus, train drivers seemed most concerned with what an object is, rather than contemplating its detailed features (see Figure 5A).\nTwo subfactors can easily be compared between the two obstacle types. In case of Location, the same pattern emerged for people and objects (see Figure 5B): train drivers rarely mentioned the obstacle's proximity to the train but rather focused on its relation to the tracks (e.g., child is close to the tracks, tree could already be on the tracks) or its relation to other objects (e.g., person is behind the safety line, tree could hang in the overhead lines). Conversely, train drivers described people and objects quite differently in terms of their Physical Features (see Figure 5B). The overall number of statements was similar (4.9% for people, 3.8% for objects & animals), but the specific contents differed considerably. For people, many statements were about Clothing & Gadgets (e.g., worker is wearing a safety vest, person could wear headphones). Unsurprisingly, this category was not used for objects and animals. However, an interesting double dissociation was observed for situation-specific versus permanent physical features. On the one hand, train drivers used situation-specific features of Posture & Rotation much more often when reasoning about people than objects (e.g., worker is turning his back towards the train, person could be sitting). On the other hand, they used permanent Bodily Features extensively to describe objects but not to describe people (e.g., tree is small, box could be"}, {"title": "4.2.2 What are people doing: Movement and Action", "content": "When reasoning about the risk associated with people, train drivers paid close attention to what they were doing. In fact, when adding all statements about Movement (5.9%) and Action (5.2%), their joint share was higher than that of Identity (9.6%), suggesting that identification is insufficient to evaluate the risk of colliding with people. However, the usage of these behavioural concepts strongly depended on the specific image (see Figure 6).\nMovement was mentioned most often when a person was on the tracks and thus the risk of collision was imminent unless the person would move. In this case, movement made up 13.3% of train drivers' total statements. Movement also was used a lot when people moved away from the tracks or when several people moved in different directions. Generally, movement direction relative to the tracks was more important than the type of movement (e.g., running, not standing still).\nMovement is a rather straight-forward concept that leaves little room for interpretation. In contrast, understanding people's actions requires train drivers to reason about their behaviour on a higher level of abstraction. Such inferences strongly depended on image content. First, people's General Actions (e.g., person might wait for the train) was mentioned most often for an image showing a lonely person on a platform and this person's intentions were somewhat ambiguous. Conversely, general actions were mentioned least often for two images showing level crossings. This tendency to avoid abstract behavioural descriptions for level crossings was also observed for all other action categories, except for rule violations (see below). The second action category, Interaction with People & Objects, stood out for two images where it was used much more often than for all other images: a child playing with her mother next to the tracks and a pram left on the tracks. While considering interactions seems obvious in the former case, it was somewhat surprising in the latter, given that no people were present. Still, train drivers interpreted why people might have left the pram and anticipated how they might try to save it. Another type of interaction is Communication with the Train Driver. This category was highly relevant to reason about track workers but not about ordinary people. The fourth action category, Mishaps, was used most often for an impaired person leaving the tracks with crutches, for groups of people on a platform, and for workers being too close to the tracks. Finally, train drivers reasoned about Rule Violations. Ironically, this category was used least often for a person walking on the tracks, because the coding scheme assigned this to the subfactors Location and Movement. The image with the most frequent statements about rule violations was the one with the person using crutches. Here, train drivers reasoned about the person stepping on the rail head and having placed an object on the tracks. Placing objects also resulted in frequent statements about rule violations for the two images showing a pram and a cardboard box on the tracks.

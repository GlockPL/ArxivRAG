{"title": "Euska\u00f1olDS: A Naturally Sourced Corpus for Basque-Spanish Code-Switching", "authors": ["Maite Heredia", "Jeremy Barnes", "Aitor Soroa"], "abstract": "Code-switching (CS) remains a significant challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP), mainly due a lack of relevant data. In the context of the contact between the Basque and Spanish languages in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, CS frequently occurs in both formal and informal spontaneous inter- actions. However, resources to analyse this phenomenon and support the development and evaluation of models capable of understand- ing and generating code-switched language for this language pair are almost non-existent. We introduce a first approach to develop a naturally sourced corpus for Basque-Spanish code-switching. Our methodology consists of identifying CS texts from previously available corpora using language identification models, which are then manually validated to obtain a reliable subset of CS instances. We present the properties of our corpus and make it available under the name Euska\u00f1olDS.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Code-switching (CS) is a phenomenon that consists of alternating or mixing between two or more languages within a single discourse. It is common in multilingual communities, both in oral and writ- ten communication (Appel and Muysken, 2005; Sarkisov, 2022). Since it is estimated that multi- lingualism is a standard for more than half of the world population (Tucker, 2001), code-switching can be of great interest, alongside other phenom- ena that arise from language contact, such as bor- rowings and calques. Nevertheless, language mod- els generally perform worse in CS scenarios, even multilingual models that are supposedly proficient in the languages (Winata et al., 2021; Aguilar et al., 2020). Therefore, it is essential to research and de-velop resources and applications for Natural Lan- guage Processing (NLP) that take into account the existence of CS.\nAccording to the survey by Winata et al. (2023), works on computational approaches to CS include Hindi-English, Spanish-English and Chinese-English as the most researched language pairs, although they point out the need to \"broaden the language scope of CS research\". In this re- spect, our research centres on Basque (ISO 639- 3: eus), a minoritized low-resource language spo- ken in the in the western Pyrenees. Most of its speakers are bilingual and also speak Spanish (ISO 639-3: spa) or French (ISO 639-3: fra). The con- tact between these languages results in different common phenomena, including code-switching with either language, shown in examples 1 and 2. Although there are numerous studies on socio- pragmatic features of this contact (Barredo, 2003; Ibarra Murillo, 2014; Epelde et al., 2020) and the presence of code-switching between Basque and Spanish is well documented in NLP (Garc\u00eda- Sardi\u00f1a et al., 2018; Escribano et al., 2022), natu- rally sourced resources are still lacking.\n(1)\nY si lo ponen m\u00e1s bonito eta musika polita jende gehiago juteko[...]!\nAnd if they decorate the place and play good music, is so that people will go there[...]!\n(Barredo, 2003)\n(2)\nComment sans boire de vin egon behar dugu, nos malheureuses gorges behar dute idortu.\nSince we have to live without drinking wine, our unfortunate throats will get dry.\n(Epelde et al., 2020)\nTo better study the contact between these lan- guages and the ability of models to process CS, we develop a semi-supervised methodology to ob- tain code-switched sentences from pre-existing corpora, with the help of language identification"}, {"title": "2 The Euska\u00f1olDS Dataset", "content": "We present a dataset of instances containing code- switching between Spanish and Basque, which are two languages from different linguistic fami- lies with many perceptible typological differences. For example, Spanish is an fusional language with nominative-accusative alignment and SVO domi- nant word order, whereas Basque is an agglutina- tive language with ergative-absolutive alignment, and its dominant word order is SOV. Their simi- larities include similar phonetic inventories, and a long shared history of contact and mutual sociolin- guistic influence.\nThe final Euska\u00f1olDS dataset has two splits: sil- ver, automatically classified, and gold, manually filtered. We explain in detail the process to obtain them, as well as provide a quantitative and quali- tative analysis on the interesting properties of our dataset."}, {"title": "2.1 Dataset Sources", "content": "We source our data from the following corpora, summarized in Table 1:\nBasqueParl (Escribano et al., 2022) is a corpus of Basque parliamentary transcriptions. Basque and Spanish are both vehicular languages in these interactions, resulting in \"heavy Basque-Spanish code-switching\", as well as frequent language switches between exchanges.\nHelduGazte (de Landa et al., 2019; Fernan- dez de Landa and Agerri, 2021) is composed of almost 6 million tweets by Basque speakers, used to analyse the use of formal and informal Basque on social media, as well as adult and young speech.\nCovid-19 (Fernandez de Landa et al., 2024) is a corpus of 8 million tweets by Basque speakers during the Covid-19 pandemic, used to study di- achronic trends of language use during different stages of the pandemic.\nWe consider BasqueParl as a source of formal language, whereas both twitter datasets include a mixture of formal and informal speech, tending to- wards informal. Therefore, our corpus collects a wide variety of topics and different diaphasic and diatopic varieties, as well as spoken and written language."}, {"title": "2.2 Silver Set: Automatic Classification", "content": "To filter the instances, we propose a semi- supervised approach that first employs the model for Language Identification from FastText (Joulin et al., 2016a,b) to automatically classify the in- stances. The model was trained to identify 217 lan- guages, including Spanish and Basque, and also outputs a confidence level for each tag. In our dataset, both the average and the median confi- dence of the predictions are 99%, indicating that the majority of the predictions of the models have a high confidence. When instances are filtered by their confidence level, the lower the confidence, the higher probability of them containing CS. Pre- liminary testing indicated that filtering instances that have a confidence lower than 90% and that are tagged as Basque and Spanish or viceversa gives us a high-precision set of instances exhibiting CS. The final silver split has a total of 20,008 in- stances, 597 sourced from BasqueParl, 19,339 from Covid-19 and 72 from HelduGazte."}, {"title": "2.3 Gold Set: Manual Validation", "content": "To obtain a gold-standard test set, we manually verify a subset of the automatically filtered sen- tences. We classify all BasqueParl and Hel-"}, {"title": "2.4 Qualitative Analysis", "content": "As a first insight into our corpus, we perform a manual analysis of some qualitative aspects of our gold set. First, we classify the instances accord- ing to the following widespread typology (Appel and Muysken, 2006), illustrated in Table 3 with in- stances from the corpus:\n\u2022 Inter-sentential CS occurs between sen- tences, and is the most represented type in our corpus.\n\u2022 Intra-sentential CS occurs in the middle of a sentence.\n\u2022 Emblematic CS occurs between a sentence and an exclamation or a tag.\nAs shown in Table 4, most instances exhibit inter-sentential CS, mainly due to those from Covid-19 and BasqueParl. On the other hand, Hel- duGazte has more intra-sentential or code-mixed sentences, but also comes from a smaller and less representative dataset. The least represented type is emblematic CS, 3.14% of the total corpus. This proportion may have been larger if we included more informal conversations, as they tend to occur more often in informal oral speech (Ibarra Murillo, 2019).\nThe tweets in our dataset often contain both in- formality traits and dialectal elements. The pres- ence of different Basque dialects, also called eu- skalkiak, is specially notable. In Example 5, we can see some of these traits: compare standard tem- porada with temporadie or dago with dao.\n(5) Ezteu nahi bezela hasi tenporadie, ba\u00f1o hau hasi besteik ezta e\u00f1 ta lan asko daola etteko garbi dao. Un placer volver a ver tantas caras conocidas.\nI don't want to start the season like this, but not only has it just started and it is clear that there is a lot to do. A pleasure to see so many familiar faces..\nSimilarly, inter-sentential CS is common in re- ported speech, where the language shifts when re- porting what someone said in a different language. This is especially true in BasqueParl, as the speak- ers are constantly referencing other interventions.\n(6)\nEdo beste erantzun berean esandako beste gauza bat: \"As\u00ed el modelo A, en su distribu- ci\u00f3n horaria actual tendr\u00eda que reformula- rse\".\nAnd another thing said in that same answer: \"Thus, model A, in its current time distribu- tion, would have to be reformulated.\".\nThe nature of isolated tweets means that we are missing important context (responses, retweets,"}, {"title": "3 Applications & Future Work", "content": "The dataset we have presented is the first resource that gathers instances with Basque-Spanish CS, and represents a first step towards evaluating and training models for this language pair.\nThis corpus could be used for the theoretical study of code-switching features between Basque and Spanish, as demonstrated by the shallow in- sights already provided here. It can also be useful to develop datasets for NLP tasks, such as token language identification or stance detection on CS text, either on its own or in combination with other monolingual or bilingual datasets."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we present Euska\u00f1olDS, a new re- source for Basque-Spanish code-switching. It con- sists of a corpus of 20,000 instances sourced from tweets and parliamentary transcriptions. The in- stances have been filtered with a Language Identi- fication system and manually classified, resulting in two versions of the corpus: a silver set, that con- tains all of the automatically identified instances, and a gold set, that only contains a reliable subset. We also present a first exploration of the phenom- ena observed in the corpus. We believe it is a re- source of interest for different NLP and linguistic applications, that can open the door for both practi- cal and theoretical research in Basque-Spanish CS."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "The limitations that we have encountered during the creation of our corpus are mainly related to the low-resource status of Basque and the limited previous research on the Basque-Spanish CS pair in the NLP field. The data collection was made available thanks to previous works of researchers to gather natural corpora for the Basque language. The corpora of Basque tweets is specially relevant, because the X API has since been closed, limit- ing the availability of spontaneous data that in- cludes not only instances of CS but also other re- search topics. Finally, we would like to mention that our corpus only refers to code-switching be- tween Basque-Spanish, as we have considered the Basque-French pair to be out of scope for the cur- rent work."}]}

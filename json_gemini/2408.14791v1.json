INTRODUCTION", "content": "By automating routine, rule-based processes that were previously completed by people, robotic process automation (RPA) is revolutionising the way businesses run. It entails the use of \"bots,\" or software robots, to interface with various systems and applications to carry out tasks while imitating human behaviour [1], [2]. RPA makes use of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to evaluate and comprehend the steps in a specific process. Once they are trained, the software robots can carry out those activities with greater accuracy, speed, and precision than people can, frequently. Finance, healthcare, manufacturing, customer service, and other fields and sectors can all benefit from the use of RPA. The idea behind RPA is to find repetitive, rule-based jobs that take a lot of time and are prone to mistakes when done manually. Data input, data validation, data extraction, report production, and other comparable procedures are examples of these duties. Organizations can increase operational effectiveness, cut costs, improve accuracy, and speed up processing times by automating certain processes [3], [4], [5]. RPA can be applied in a variety of ways, from straightforward rule-based automation to more sophisticated intelligent automation. Automating predetermined tasks with simple RPA entails adhering to a set of rules or guidelines. Contrarily, intelligent automation combines cognitive tools like machine learning and natural language processing to provide bots the ability to manage unstructured data, make judgments, and adjust to changing circumstances. The non-invasive aspect of RPA, which can operate on top of current systems without requiring large changes to the underlying infrastructure, is one of its key advantages. It can be integrated with a wide range of software programmes, legacy systems, databases, websites, and more, enabling businesses to make the most of their current IT expenditures. Due to its ability to boost productivity, streamline processes, and free up employees to work on higher-value tasks, RPA is quickly gaining appeal. As RPA continues to influence the future of labour and corporate processes, academics and educators must keep up with its developments and ramifications."}, {"title": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "RPA has indeed ignited a significant volume of literature spanning diverse domains, providing valuable insights into its applications, impacts, and future potential. Here's an overview of the literature landscape:\nOne can find papers on the potential for using IT solutions for long-term business continuity management in the literature [6] [3]. The present pandemic and lockdown time are also considered by several authors, who offer reflection on how the pandemic exposed the fragility of digitally immature organizations, education, employment, and life. In various fields, including information technology, human resources, telecommunication, finance, real estate management, insurance, education, legal services, banking, and logistics, automated software robots are becoming more and more common [7], [8].\nTo analyse the use of RPA within a BPO unit, Aguirre and Rodriguez conducted a case study [9]. In their investigation, they discovered that productivity increased, and processing times dropped when RPA was utilised for a few of the organization's back-office tasks. The authors of [10]give Table Organization (TAO). It is a method for finding, extracting, and organising data from tables in PDF documents automatically. TAO recognises and extracts table information from documents using layout heuristics and k-nearest neighbour processing. This technique improves the representation of the data extracted from PDF tables. TAO's performance is comparable to that of earlier table extraction approaches, but it has more flexibility and more robustness when tested with different document layouts.\nDay-Yang, Shou-Wei, and Tzu-Chuan stressed that the use of such technologies is causing a change in how businesses work, and that this change has as its result the close fusion of digital technology and business processes. As a result of this integration, new models for how these institutions operate are created, with digital technology at their centre[11]. Define the software robot concept as a starting point for an investigation of the use of RPA tools as one of the strategies for executing digital transformation. Willcocks and Lacity [12] claim that it is software that automates specific human tasks that are performed as part of a specified business process, most frequently by accurately replicating (mimicking) them. According to this method, a robot is not recognised by a technological gadget and does not have the ability to move like a human.\nAuthors in [13] discussed the integration of automation and Al-driven processes represents a transformative shift in how businesses operate, offering substantial benefits in efficiency, decision-making, and innovation. However, realizing these benefits requires addressing challenges related to technology implementation, change management, and cultural adaptation. Future research should focus on industry-specific applications and detailed case studies to provide tailored insights and strategies, ensuring that organizations can successfully navigate the complexities of Al-powered digital transformation.\nThe study [14] demonstrates the successful application of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC and RPA in streamlining the medical expense claims process under Taiwan's NHI system, significantly reducing process time and enhancing efficiency. By reallocating human resources to more valuable tasks, healthcare institutions can offer more comprehensive and patient-centric services, showcasing a real-world example of Lean digital transformation in the healthcare sector. Future research should explore the broader implementation of these approaches in various healthcare settings to further validate their benefits."}, {"title": "3. RPA VS BPM", "content": "Business process management and robotic process automation are two different but complimentary methods for automating processes in enterprises. Despite their commonalities, they have diverse focuses and are used for various things.\nScope: RPA often automates repetitive and rule-based tasks by focusing on certain tasks or activities within a process. Without significantly altering the general process flow, it concentrates on automating particular steps inside already-existing processes. BPM, on the other hand, is concerned with the overall management and optimization of business processes from beginning to end. Whole processes are analysed, modelled, designed, and monitored as a part of this process, which frequently aims to increase effectiveness, efficiency, and agility [16].\nAutomation Level: RPA is best used to automate repetitive, manual processes that entail interacting with software programmes. RPA robots mimic human behaviour and carry out activities using a user interface (UI). For jobs involving organised and semi-structured data, it is effective. Contrarily, BPM focuses on managing and orchestrating processes. Automation may be a part of it, but it also takes into account other things like process design, workflow management, teamwork, and integration with other systems and stakeholders[17].\nProcess Complexity: RPA works well for automating repeated operations that are generally easy to perform. It is frequently used for data entry, data verification, and report production duties [18]. Complex processes with several steps, decision points, and interactions between numerous systems and stakeholders are better managed with BPM. It permits modelling and process optimization for whole workflows, including both automated and human tasks.\nRPA implementations are often quicker and more agile than BPM implementations in terms of implementation strategy. Without making significant changes to the current IT infrastructure, individual processes can be swiftly deployed and automated using RPA bots. On the other hand, BPM implementations take a more strategic, all-encompassing approach. They necessitate process modification and analysis, and frequently involve integrating different systems and stakeholders. BPM implementations could take longer, but they might also affect the organisation more broadly. RPA and BPM can be combined in the real world to maximise automation and process improvement. RPA can be used to automate repetitive operations and lessen manual labour within steps of a BPM-managed process. RPA gives the tactical automation tools to speed up certain process tasks, whereas BPM provides the overall framework for process management and optimization."}, {"title": "4.

METHODLOGY AND RESULTS", "content": "The ability to accurately extract data from documents like invoices, purchase orders, payment advices, and other bespoke documents is one of the most crucial aspects of automating business activities.\nThe information included in these documents must be manually read and comprehended in a laborious manner in a typical workflow, which adds time and expense for any organisation. Figure 3 show the steps followed for extracting the structured data from invoices using RPA. Organizations can now unwind and complete the time-consuming and stressful jobs with a single click thanks to the integration of Intelligent RPA and Document Information Extraction service, as demonstrated in the image below.\nIn the analysis and evaluation of the manual and RPA processes, we compared human-performed tasks with those executed by RPA software bots. The focus was on measuring efficiency and accuracy in extracting data from processed invoices, aiming to assess the effectiveness of the RPA system.\nUiPath Studio was selected for this study due to its advanced capabilities in developing and deploying RPA workflows tailored for invoice processing tasks. This version was chosen to leverage the latest features and improvements in the software, ensuring optimal performance and functionality for the study.\nVisual Workflow Designer: UiPath Studio includes an intuitive visual workflow designer that allows users to create and manage automation processes through a user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface. This feature is essential for designing complex workflows without requiring extensive coding expertise.\nUiPath.PDF Activities Dependency: The UiPath.PDF Activities package was integrated into UiPath Studio to enhance the extraction and processing of data from PDF invoices. This package provides specialized activities for reading and extracting data from PDF documents, crucial for handling the varied formats and layouts of invoice data.\nUiPath.Database.Activities: In our study, we utilized this package for interacting with databases. We employed activities such as Execute Query, Execute Non-Query, and Insert, Update, and Delete to store and manage data efficiently within the database.\nThe manual data extraction process involved five operators: two data entry personnel who transcribed invoice details into the system, one verification specialist who ensured data accuracy, one data reviewer who checked for completeness, and one quality assurance analyst who audited the entire process for errors. Adherence to detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and accuracy checks were critical in maintaining data integrity and consistency. This manual process serves as a baseline for evaluating the efficiency and accuracy of RPA.\nTo conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we designed five distinct scenarios, each involving a different number of invoices:\nCase 1 (10 invoices): In this scenario, we processed a set of 10 invoices using both manual and RPA methods to extract relevant data.\nCase 2 (15 invoices): Similarly, we expanded the scope to 15 invoices to observe how the performance of both manual and RPA processes scaled with increased workload.\nCase 3 (20 invoices): This scenario involved processing 20 invoices, providing further insights into the scalability and efficiency of the RPA system across a larger dataset.\nCase 4 (25 invoices): We examined the performance of both methods in handling 25 invoices, aiming to assess the upper limits of scalability and the potential impact on efficiency and accuracy.\nIn Case 5, the evaluation extends to processing a set of 30 invoices using both manual and RPA methods. This expanded scenario allows for a comprehensive assessment of the scalability, efficiency, and accuracy of both approaches when handling a larger workload.\nBy increasing the number of invoices to 30, we aim to gain deeper insights into how both manual and RPA processes perform as the workload grows. This includes observing any potential bottlenecks or limitations in scalability, as well as assessing the impact on efficiency and accuracy.\nFor each case, we meticulously measured and compared several key metrics:\nEfficiency: This metric quantifies the time and effort required to complete the task. We compared the time taken for humans to manually extract data from invoices against the time taken by RPA bots to perform the same task.\nAccuracy: Accuracy measures the precision and reliability of data extraction. We compared the error rates between human-performed tasks and those executed by RPA bots, focusing on discrepancies or mistakes in the extracted data.\nBy analysing the data collected from these five scenarios, we gained valuable insights into the performance of the RPA system compared to manual processes. These insights allow us to make informed decisions regarding the implementation and optimization of RPA solutions within the organization, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement."}, {"title": "7.

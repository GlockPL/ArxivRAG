PINNs are often employed to solve algebraic or differential equations to replace some or even all steps of multi-stage computational workflows, leading to their significant speed-up. However, wide adoption of PINNs is still hindered by reliability issues, particularly at extreme ends of the input parameter ranges. In this study, we demonstrate this in the context of a system of coupled non-linear differential reaction-diffusion and heat transfer equations related to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which are solved by a finite-difference method with a PINN used in evaluating their source terms. It is shown that the testing strategies traditionally used to assess the accuracy of neural networks as function approximators can overlook the peculiarities which ultimately cause instabilities of the finite-difference solver. We propose a domain knowledge-based modifications to the PINN architecture ensuring its correct asymptotic behavior. When combined with an improved numerical scheme employed as an initial guess generator, the proposed modifications are shown to recover the overall stability of the simulations, while preserving the speed-up brought by PINN as the workflow component.

One of the benefits brought by employing NNs as an alternative to traditional numerical methods is shifting the computational burden to the training phase, which is performed only once, thus enabling faster solution generation during the inference phase. This can be especially helpful in accelerating multi-stage simulations when the output of one computational method is used as an input to another one, as often encountered in engineering problems or digital twins designs 2,3.\nAn illustrative example can be found in chemical engineering problems related to ground-up modeling of chemical reactor or even entire chemical plants. In such applications, theoretical models are commonly available for finding the rates of both the micro-scale phenomena (e.g., molecular-level chemical reactions) and macro-scale phenomena (e.g., heat and mass transport). Their coupling results then in a system of equations which should be solved self-consistently, e.g., by solving the 'micro-scale' equations as a sub-task each time when the evaluation of the source terms in 'macro-scale' equations is required. Replacing solution of such sub-tasks with NNs is then an attractive option to accelerate the overal simulation.\nDespite their advantages, NNs, like many other models which learn from data, often lack interpretability. This makes their reliability in scientific or mission-critical applications questionable. Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach has been proposed to partially overcome this drawback by incorporating the available theoretical knowledge into the NN training process4. This approach suggests using exact equations known from the theory as the objectives that the function approximated by NN is expected to satisfy.

It has become an invaluable tool in the chemical industry, offering a pathway to sustainable and diversified fuel sources, providing an alternative route to conventional petrochemical processes.\nAt its core, the FTS process involves the catalytic reaction, which starts from CO and H2, and forms a wide range of hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, alkenes. The overall chemical reactions in which FTS transformations can be summarized are:\n$nCO + (2n + 1)H_2 \\rightarrow C_nH_{2n+2} + nH_2O$ (1)\n$nCO + 2n H_2 \\rightarrow C_nH_{2n} + nH_2O$ (2)\nDetailed mechanism behind these overall reactions depends on thermodynamic conditions and the type of catalyst, and different models are available to describe their actual chemistry9.\nCatalysts play a central role in the FTS process as the reactions predominantly take place on the active sites which are present on the catalyst surface. A significant challenge in FTS is optimizing the reaction rates, which is facilitated by maximizing the surface area of these catalysts. For this purpose, porous catalyst particles are employed, offering a large surface area to volume ratio. This implies that the simulation of the FTS in practical setups should take both the reactions and species transport into account, thereby forming a reaction-diffusion type of the problem.\nIndustrial viability of the FTS process is tightly connected with the design of chemical reactors, which provide a controlled environment for the reactions, enhance catalyst performance and manage heat, allowing for efficient, scalable, safe, and flexible production of the hydrocarbons. Simulating the reactors used for running the FTS process serves multiple important purposes, such as optimizing reaction conditions to maximize their yield and selectivity, preventing undesirable phenomena, such as thermal runaway, ensuring safety and scalability.\nIn traditional approaches to simulating FTS reactors, the behavior of catalyst particles is often fitted using empirical formulae. However, these models necessitate re-parameterization whenever there are changes in particle characteristics such as, size, shape, or porosity. Moreover, empirical formulae typically provide reasonable accuracy within the limited range of reaction conditions, which further restricts the flexibility of process optimization under varied operating conditions."}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "The ground-up approach suggests breaking down the overall transformation eqs. (1), (2) into a series of interconnected elementary steps or stages. Each step is then described as an individual reaction with its own rate constant, using which the full reaction pathway kinetics is deduced. In the case of FTS, the processes described by the elementary steps typically include reactant adsorption, chain initiation, chain growth, and product formation/desorption. Such a description is typical for a 'microkinetic' approach 14,15,16,17, as the surface of a catalyst at which the chemical transformations of interest occur acts as a 'microdomain'. The rate constants and other parameters for these equations are estimated based on experimental data, empirical correlations, or ab initio modelling.\nIn this work, we adhere to the set of elementary reactions suggested in 18,19. This model follows CO insertion mechanism of FTS and considers the stationary state of the reacting system, when a dynamic equilibrium has been established between the rates at which different intermediate substances are produced and consumed. As a result, the balance constraints lead to a non-linear algebraic equation which needs to be solved in order to find the dependence of the overall transformation on the thermodynamic conditions 18,19:\n$\\frac{1}{[S]} = C_0 + C_S\\alpha_1 (1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3 + \\alpha_2\\alpha_3\\alpha_4 + ...)$ (3)\n(where the summation continues up to infinity and its properties will be discussed in more details in subsection 3.1).

Note that in contrast to the original definitions, we define $c > 0$, which provides a more convenient notation for asymptotics analysis performed below.\nWhen $[S]$ for the given reaction conditions has been found by solving Eq.

However, in the present study we ignore its effect on the temperature change of the system for the sake of simplicity, as such a simplification preserves all the key properties of the reaction-diffusion system related to our objectives. Unless otherwise specified, all quantities analyzed in the Results section will refer to T = 493.15K.\nAbility of the microkinetics model to find the overall consumption rates for the FTS reactants can now to be put into the context of reactor modeling. Through its boundary, the pellet interacts with the reactor bulk flow. Obtaining the relationship between the the thermodynamic conditions on the pellet boundary and its productivity as a sink or source in the reactor volume is thus an essential element in linking the microkinetics scale of atomic-level processes and the scale of entire reactor within the ground-up approach to the simulations.\nTo this end, we focus on the scale of the catalyst pellets. In simplest approximation, the catalyst pellet can be modeled as a spherical particle in which the transport of the reactants and products is coupled to their chemical intercoversions. The substances transport within the porous volume of the pellets is typically modeled as a diffusion process, with the source terms determined by the reaction rates predicted by the microkinetics model. The simulation of the substances distribution within the pellets is thus a multi-staged problem built on top microkinetics model reviewed above.\nIn order to formulate this 'pellet-scale' problem, we will consider a spherical pellet, and describe the substances transport as a steady-state diffusion governed by a Fick's law, with constant diffusivities equal to Dco = 1.3 \\cdot 10^{-8} \\frac{m^2}{s}."}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "DH2 = 3.6 \u00b7 10^{-8} \\frac{m^2}{s}, DH2O = 1.7 \u00b7 10^{-8} \\frac{m^2}{s}, \\varepsilon_p = 0.62, \\tau_p = 2. As a further simplification, we also assume that only initial reactants (H2 and CO) and ultimate FTS synthesis products (paraffins, olefins and H2O) participate in mass transport across the pellet, while all intermediate substances do not. Such assumption allows using microkinetic model in a 'local' or 'pointwise' manner, eliminating the need to solve diffusion equations for each of the intermediates occurring in elementary transformations.\nWith the above assumptions, it is now possible to formulate the equations governing the distribution of substances in the pellet as\n$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} (r^2 D_j \\frac{dc_j}{dr}) = S_j,$ (21)\nwhere r is the radial coordinate of the spherical coordinate system, j enumerates the substances (j = CO, H2, H2O), $c_j(r)$ is the concentration (specifically, the amount concentration, in $mol/m^3$) of j-th substance and $D_j$ is its corresponding \u2018effective' diffusion coefficient (selected so that the Fick's law could adequately approximate the flux of substances in the pellet pores), $s_j({c_k})$ is the source term equal to the amount of the j-th substance produced per unit volume per unit time. Importantly, $s_j$ depend on all concentrations $c_j$, but not on r explicitly. They are obtained as\n$S_j = \\rho_{cat} R_j(P_{CO}, P_{H_2}, P_{H_2O}, T)$ (22)\nwhere $\\rho_{cat} = 1980 kg/m^3$ is the effective density of the catalyst material. Dependence of $R_j$ on the partial pressures of substances is determined by (16), (17), with the proper conversion of units.\nAdditional clarification needs to be made here regarding the arguments on which the source terms in (22) depend. Although original microkinetic model 18,19 was parameterized using the partial pressures of reactants as its input parameters, Eqs. (21) are formulated in terms of concentrations. The conversion thus should be made between these two quantities. To this end, it is essential to note that underlying experimental data in 18,19 was collected using the slurry reactor, in which the mixture of reactants gases was bubbled through a liquid in which the catalyst is suspended in form of rather small (< 90 \u00b5m) solid particles. By such design, the influence the physical transport resistances were minimized to allow for intrinsic kinetic measurements 18,19. However, in spite of using partial pressures in the original model, it is usually assumed that the reaction kinetics is determined by concentrations rather than pressures 21.\nAccordingly, the partial pressures $P_{CO}, P_{H_2}, P_{H_2O}$ should rather be treated merely as the 'proxies' to the concentrations of corresponding substances inside of the catalyst particles. The role"}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "of these 'proxies' can be formalized by taking into account that when the certain substance present in both gas phase (outside of the catalyst) and a condensed phase (e.g., in wax covering the catalyst surface) regions sharing a common boundary and being in thermodynamic equilibrium, the partial pressure of the substance in the gas phase is related to its concentration in the condensed phase by Henry's law 22. We thus assume that Henry's law can also be used in the 'inverse' manner when it comes to applying the model parameterized in 18,19 to inner space of the catalyst pellets. Specifically, given some concentrations cj of CO, H2 and H2O at certain point r of the pellet, they can be converted through the Henry constant $H_j^P$ as\n$P_j(r) = c_j(r) \\cdot H_j^P$ (23)\ninto 'effective' partial pressures $P_j$ which these substances would have in the gas phase if they were supplied to the slurry reactor used by the authors of 18,19. Such pressures should then suitable to recreate the same conditions inside of the particle of the slurry reactor as the ones observed at the given point r of the pellet. In other words, when (23) is substituted into (5)\u2013(12), the input variables of the original microkinetics model are changed from partial pressures to concentrations, as desired. Here, we implicitly assume that the same values of the Henry's constants are suitable in both (23) (which describes the catalytic particles of the slurry reactor used in 18,19) and (24) (which is related to the material of the pellet being modelled). The following values were used 23,24: $H_{CO}^P = 0.165 \\frac{bar \\cdot m^3}{mol}, H_{H_2}^P = 0.222 \\frac{bar \\cdot m^3}{mol}, H_{H_2O}^P = 0.0291 \\frac{bar \\cdot m^3}{mol}$. For the sake of simplicity, all Henry's constants are assumed to be temperature- and concentrations-independent.\nTogether with (16), (17), Eqs. (23), (22) and (21) form the system of interrelated non-linear differential equations. By solving this system, the concentration \u2018profiles' $c_j(r)$ of the pellet can be found and these data can then be used for further analysis either on its own, or be converted into the volumetric production or consumption rates of all substances and used in a larger-scale model of FTS reactor.\nReaction-diffusion system (21) requires also the set boundary conditions to be defined. Similarly to 25,26,27, no-flux boundary conditions ($\\frac{dc_i}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$) are used for all concentrations at the center of the pellet. On the outer surface of the pellet, the boundary conditions for the concentrations $c_j|_{surf} = c_j(r = R_p)$ (we used $R_p = 0.85 mm$ throughout this work) are obtained from Henry's law as\n$c_j(r = R_p) = \\frac{P_j^{surf}}{H_j^P}$ (24)\nwhere $H_j^P$ is the Henry's constant for the j-th substance and $P_j^{surf}$ is equal to its partial pressures in the medium surrounding the pellet, which is assumed to be in a gas phase found in the reactor volume. The possible presence of liquid film on the surface of the catalyst pellet is neglected in our current model."}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "For the actual computations, the system of reaction-diffusion equations (21) as well as their boundary conditions were non-dimensionalized by introducing a 'reference concentration' $C_{ref} = \\frac{P_{max}}{RT_{min}} = 1526.5 \\frac{mol}{m^3}$ (the amount concentration observed in an ideal gas at Pmax = 6 MPa). As we expect that the concentration of reactants inside of the pellet is smaller than that in its surrounding gas phase, the introduced estimate should provide a reasonable upper bound for the concentrations observed in the pellet. Accordingly, non-dimensionalized concentrations are introduced as\n$w_j = \\frac{C_i}{C_{ref}}$\nFinally, using the pellet radius as the unit of length, we consider $x = \\frac{r}{R_p}$ as a new non-dimensionalized radial coordinate. In these non-dimensionalized quantities, the Eqs.(21) read\n$\\frac{1}{x^2} \\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 \\frac{dw_j}{dx}) = S_j(x),$ (25)\nwhere $S_j(x) = \\frac{R_p^2}{D_j C_{ref}} S_j({C_k(x R_p)}, T)$ is the non-dimensionalized source term.\nNote that stoichiometry of (1), (2) suggests that the molar production rate of H2O equals the molar consumption rate of CO: $R_{H_2O} = -R_{CO}$ (CO is the only source of oxygen for H2O being produced as one of FTS products). This allows effectively eliminating one of the unknowns, viz. $C_{H_2O}$, from the system. Indeed, it can be directly verified that as soon as there is some function $w_{CO}(x)$ satisfying (25) with j = CO and its boundary conditions,\n$w_{H_2O}(x) = - \\frac{D_{CO}}{D_{H_2O}} w_{CO}(x) + \\frac{D_{CO}}{D_{H_2O}} w_{CO}(1) + w_{H_2O}(1)$ (26)\nwill satisfy (25) with j = H2O as well as its boundary conditions. Here, $w_j(1), j = CO$ or H2O, represents the non-dimensionalized concentrations on the outer surface of the pellet, determined by the boundary conditions. It is thus sufficient to solve (25) for the concentrations of H2 and CO only, while using applying (26) to eliminate H2O concentration from their source terms.\nAs can be seen from the above discussion, even within a simplified model, the ground-up modeling of the distributions of substances inside of the catalyst pellet not only requires nu-merically solving diffusion equations, but also computing their source terms at each iteration of the solver. This further requires entire microkinetics model to be simulated 'on-the-fly', including solving of non-linear equation (3). It is thus advantageous to use numreical approximation methods to accelerate the computationally demanding steps by avoiding the need of explicitly solving all underlying chemical kinetics equations on each iteration.\nAs we have previously shown in 13, neural networks, specifically PINNs, can be applied for this purpose. Still, as we will"}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "demonstrate in subsection 2.3, special care must be taken when any approximation is used in the source terms of the reaction-diffusion equations. In particular, we will show that seemingly minor inaccuracies (cf. Fig. 2) in the approximation of s(c) can lead to drastically unphysical results, such as negative concentrations. We will then proceed by analyzing the true asymptotic behaviour of the chosen microkinetics model, modifying original PINN model to match those asymptotics by design and demonstrating that with such a modification, the PINN model becomes applicable for accelerating the source terms of the reaction-diffusion equations."}, {"title": "A simplified 'toy model' example", "content": "In order to showcase how minor inaccuracies (or, more properly, incorrect asymptotics) in approximation of s(c) even in a small region near c = 0 can lead to unphysical solutions of (27), the following simple model example can be helpful. Consider a simple one-dimensional reaction-diffusion system, which can be described, in its stationary state, by a differential equation\n$\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = -s(c)$ (27)\nwith boundary conditions c(x = 0) = 0 and c(x = 1) = 1 (for convenience, we'll use nondimensionalized units throughout this example). Such system can correspond to a transport of some substance in a reactive media, where this substance is consumed in a chemical reaction. The dependence of the source term s < 0 on the concentration c(x) is then determined by a function s(c) resulting from a complicated chain of chemical transformations. For the sake of this model example, we assume that the exact s(c) is approximated or fitted by some other function (e.g., by an NN). To simplify the system even further, assume that the 'exact' s(c) is given by\n$s(c) = -k \\cdot c,$ (28)\nand consider two of its 'approximations', which differ from the exact form only in a small region near c = 0 (Fig. 3):\n$s^{approx}_1(c) = -k \\cdot \\begin{cases} 0, & c < \\theta \\\\ c, & c > \\theta \\end{cases}$ (29)\nand\n$s^{approx}_2(c) = -k \\cdot \\begin{cases} \\theta \\frac{c}{\\theta}, & c < \\theta \\\\ c, & c \\geq \\theta \\end{cases}$ (30)\nIn all cases we set k = 50 and $\\theta = 0.04$, and used fsolve from SciPy library 28 to obtain the solutions numerically, althoug all three considered forms of s(c) can be treated analytically as well, additionally requiring the solution of a single non-linear algebraic equation when $s^{approx}_1$ or $s^{approx}_2$ are involved."}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "It is essential that although the region of negative concentrations is unphysical, all the three functions are defined for that region as well. When the exact dependence (28) is used, the properly constructed numerical solver will never call s(c) with negative argument c in given problem. This might change however, when \u2018approximate' s(c) is used in the equation instead.\nIndeed, suppose that at some x = Xthresh we have c(xthresh) = $\\theta$ and approximation $s^{approx}_1$ is used. In that case, given the shape of exact solution $c(x) = \\frac{cosh(x\\sqrt{k})}{cosh(\\sqrt{k})}$ (shown in Fig. 4), the solver can then 'assume' that the value of concentration should continue decreasing as x decreases further to the left from Xthresh. In that case, $s^{approx}_1$ will evaluate to $-k\\theta$ suggesting that c should decrease even further at even smaller coordinates and so on. The concentration can then reach c = 0 value at some finite x = x0. At that point two scenarios, both resulting from the same cause of inaccurate asymptotics of $s^{approx}_1$ can be considered. In the first scenario, the function approximating the true s(c) verifies its argument to ensure that it belong to a physically meaningful domain (in our case, c > 0) and causes the solver failure if that verification fails. In contrast to that, the second scanario can be considered which would more closely resemble the case when a fully-connected NN without any 'ad hoc' modifications had been used to approximate the true 'complicated' s(c) function. In such scenario, it would have 'silently' output 'some' value of $s^{approx}_1$ even if its argument c is unphysical (negative), and the process of solving Eq. (27) numerically could continue. As a result, a curve c(x) shown in Fig. 4 is obtained.\nWhen crafting the approximate function $s^{approx}_1(c)$ investigated in the considered scenario of our 'toy' example, we thus"}, {"title": "Reaction-diffusion equations in ground- up modelling of Fisher-Tropsch synthesis process", "content": "focused on two possibilities. For the first one, $s^{approx}_1$ simulates the situation when the model approximating s(c) was \u2018trained\u2019 only for the values of c above certain finite threshold \u03b8, and when the \u2018extrapolation regime' of the approximator works by just outputting the value of s it has \u2018learned\u2019 for the \u2018closest\u2019 concentration available in the training set (in our case, \u03b8). For the second one, $s^{approx}_2$ simulates a similar situation, but admits that for negative arguments within the extrapolation regime the approximator can output some \u2018random' dependence on concentration rather then producing a constant output. We thus added a 'small' slope to $s^{approx}_1$ for c < 0, which might be expected to 'slightly worsen' results from the previous approximation. The concentration profiles obtained under these two approximations are shown in Fig. 4.\nObtained profiles clearly demonstrate that even minor inaccuracies in s(c) asymptotic near c = 0 can result in qualitatively incorrect c(x) profiles. Moreover, the drift into unphysical region can even be self-accelerating, as shown by the effect of a small additional slope introduced in $s^{approx}_2$ in c < 0 region.\nIn practice, when NN is used to approximate the true s(c) dependence, the model is trained on a dataset composed from the discrete set of {(ci, si)} data-points. Because approximate model will not capture the true s(c) dependence exactly, its output will have some error for all of its inputs. In particular, the output value SNN(0) at c = 0 will never equal to Sexact(0) = 0 exactly, unless some special modifications are introduced into the NN architecture.

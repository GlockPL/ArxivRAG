The arena tested for harmful generations as a result of text input, image-text input, and malicious code generation. An attempt was considered a 'successful jailbreak' for violence and self-harm if the response triggered the OpenAI mod API at a threshold of 0.8 or more. Gray Swan used their internal classifiers to determine if a code generation was malicious.\nOut of all submitted attempts, 6% of harmful text, 5% of harmful image-text input, and 5% of malicious code generation submissions were considered successful jailbreaks using the above grading methods. This can be compared to the 40 model which had an attack success rate (ASR) of approximately 3.5%, 4%, 6% for harmful text, harmful image-text, and malicious code generation respectively. This targeted testing in accordance with OpenAI policies showed that ol has a slightly higher ASR compared to 40 for violence and self-harm.

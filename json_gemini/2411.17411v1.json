This field is essential in diverse areas, including computer science, statistics, and probability, where it aids in solving problems involving discrete structures [75, 142, 148, 198, 212, 333, 650, 652, 965].\nThese combinatorial methods also play a significant role in fields dealing with uncertainty, such as fuzzy set the- ory and neutrosophic theory, where they help to model and analyze indeterminate structures and relationships (cf. [99, 100, 102-104, 124, 246, 294-296, 305, 459, 583, 613, 621, 641, 737, 855, 1013, 1015\u20131018, 1018, 1019])."}, {"title": "1.2 Neutrosophic Set and Related Set Theory", "content": "Set theory is a branch of mathematics focused on the study of \"sets,\" or collections of objects [267, 953, 955]. It explores the properties, relationships, and operations of sets. Over time, numerous derived concepts related to sets have emerged, such as ordered sets [297, 473, 829], point sets [673, 675], convex sets [446, 606, 677, 753], alternative sets [964], internal sets [693], open sets [41, 43, 238, 521, 839], closed sets [40, 42, 47, 644, 818, 932], and directed sets [116].\nSets can be either finite or infinite, and recent years have seen increased attention on \"Non-standard set theory\" and \"Non-standard analysis.\" [234, 506, 565, 633, 777, 778, 792] Non-standard set theory extends classical set theory by introducing infinitesimal and infinitely large elements, allowing for detailed modeling of real-world uncertainties and complex mathematical structures. Within this framework, numerous new concepts have been proposed, including the non-standard real number system [139, 560].\nTo better address real-world uncertainties, various mathematical concepts related to sets have been proposed, such as Fuzzy Sets [246, 291, 294, 558, 921, 1013, 1035, 1036], vague sets [25, 182, 208, 495, 1028], soft sets [56, 59, 639, 670, 1000], rough sets [729, 733], soft expert sets [44, 46, 70, 71, 745, 804], hypersoft sets [4, 248, 646, 682, 683, 756, 820, 861, 1009], Hypersoft Expert Sets [10, 523\u2013530], and Neutrosophic Sets [33, 168, 306, 695, 855, 856, 894, 969]. Each of these approaches is designed to handle different types of ambiguity. Neutrosophic Sets, for example, simultaneously account for truth, indeterminacy, and falsehood, making them versatile tools for modeling uncertainty in complex systems [855, 856]. Plithogenic Sets, which generalize these uncertain sets, are also an area of active research [6, 425, 773, 848, 864, 865, 889, 895, 917]. Examples of applications for uncertain sets include fields like traffic control and decision-making [32, 61, 64, 109, 123, 237, 425, 494, 546, 558, 612, 613, 640, 807, 864, 877, 1004, 1022]. Uncertain sets, such as those mentioned above, have been extensively studied and discussed in numerous research papers [552, 855, 856, 865].\nThis paper extends several graph concepts to include Neutrosophic Overset [885], Neutrosophic Underset [885], Neutrosophic Offset [885], MultiNeutrosophic Set, Hyperfuzzy Set [411, 551, 902], and Nonstandard Real Set [885]. We then examine their relationships with other classes of graphs.\nFor reference, the relationships between Uncertain sets are illustrated in Figure 1. (cf. [378])"}, {"title": "1.3 Graphization: Transforming to Classes of Uncertain Graphs", "content": "This paper addresses concepts related to uncertain graphs and other advanced graph structures. Graph theory, a fundamental branch of mathematics, models relationships within networks by connecting vertices (or nodes) through edges. Since its inception in the 1700s, graph theory has evolved significantly and continues to be a dynamic area of research [151, 161, 279, 710, 738, 1027].\nIn disciplines such as set theory and topology, a technique called \"graphization\" is frequently employed, wherein sets are mapped onto collections of vertices and edges. This approach enables the exploration of their mathe- matical structures, the development of novel graph algorithms, and various practical applications. A primary advantage of graphization lies in its visual clarity; relationships among vertices are effectively represented by edges, making complex connections easier to visualize. Moreover, by incorporating foundational concepts from classical graph theory, including well-established graph algorithms and structural principles, we can analyze these uncertain graph classes with greater efficiency and achieve a more comprehensive understanding of their properties.\nThe importance of graph theory has led to extensive research across diverse fields, including many practical applications [129, 251, 396, 465, 469, 580, 582, 602, 676, 788, 940, 989, 1010, 1026], graph neural networks [76, 183, 319, 391, 627, 628, 827, 987, 988, 992, 1033], Bayesian networks [711], protein structure analysis [423, 944], chemical graph theory [115, 945], machine learning [433, 510, 697, 774, 988, 1001], and graph databases [86, 532, 660]. Additionally, research within graph theory has placed significant focus on understanding graph structures [90, 152, 161, 694] and developing numerous graph algorithms [133, 159, 334, 346, 355, 402, 573, 691, 935].\nBased on the above, sets that handle uncertainty, such as Fuzzy Sets and Neutrosophic Sets, are often \"gra- phized\" for further study [786]. This paper investigates various models of uncertain graphs, which expand classical graph theory by integrating dimensions of uncertainty to better represent complex and ambiguous"}, {"title": "1.4 Hyperizaion and Superhyperizaion", "content": "Generalized graph concepts encompass well-known structures such as hypergraphs [164, 183, 328, 736] and superhypergraphs [867, 868]. Similarly, in the field of soft sets, hypersoft sets [862] and superhypersoft sets have been introduced as generalized forms. Additionally, various other hyperized and superhyperized concepts exist. These types of hyperconcepts and superhyperconcepts are widely studied across numerous mathematical fields, with substantial attention directed toward their applications [532]. For example, hypergraphs have applications in areas such as hypergraph neural networks [184, 210, 327, 398, 486, 509, 513, 544, 931, 974] and hypergraph databases [52, 191, 406, 457].

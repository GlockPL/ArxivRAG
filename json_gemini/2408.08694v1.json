INTRODUCTION", "content": "Extracurricular activities play a vital role in enriching students' educational experiences by providing opportunities for practical and reflective learning, as well as personal growth. [10] These activities, organized by campus clubs, focus groups, and student organizations, can vary widely in nature and tone and are usually targeted at students with objectives that focus on learning and entertainment. Within the higher education setting-colleges and universities\u2014the experience of attending and even facilitating such activities is no exception, as they provide beneficial advantages to the students' capability to learn. A study conducted in Iran found that integrating research methods into extracurricular activities significantly enhanced undergraduate nursing students' ability to conduct evidence-based care research. [2]\nA case can then be made that incorporating extracurricular activities into the campus lifestyle has a direct impact on the students' emotional well-being and overall satisfaction. Extracurricular activities provide opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, build social connections, and explore their interests outside of the classroom. Moreover, engaging in such activities can provide students with opportunities to increase exposure to different skills and talents, develop friendships, and foster school connectedness [11]. Participation in various activities may also support positive school climates, with different activities supporting specific dimensions of school climate more than others [11], and can lead to positive outcomes such as motivation to learn, decreased absenteeism, lower levels of aggression, and lower suspension rates [11][12][13]."}, {"title": "II. RESEARCH BACKGROUND", "content": "This section explains the value of extracurricular activities, identifies the potential research gap, and describes the current state of machine learning-based natural language processing as a proposed solution."}, {"title": "A. The Value of Extracurricular Activities and the Role of Student Affairs", "content": "Extracurricular activities are generally not part of the regular school curriculum, are usually not graded, do not offer credit, and do not take place during classroom time. They are, however, still valuable to students because they provide opportunities to extend their academic and non-academic experiences under school auspices [12]. It also helps students develop important soft skills\u2014teamwork, leadership, and time management\u2014 that, while they may seem implicit and qualitative, are highly sought after by employers in the workforce when they graduate. [13] In other words, extracurricular activities provide avenues for developing student-leadership skills. [13]\nOn the topic of student-organized activities, the students dedicate substantial time and resources to meticulously plan and execute their activities. The student affairs offices of schools and campuses are typically responsible for overseeing these various aspects of student life outside of the classroom setting. Typically, students or student"}, {"title": "B. The Problem and its Background", "content": "Student activities are considered an integral part of the educational program of the institution [14]. However, the monitoring of student-organized extracurricular activities, specifically, is not explicitly quantified or mentioned. Institutions may still have guidelines and expectations for these activities, and they may even require student organizations to prepare event plans that include event objectives, timelines, and estimated costs, among others. In general, however, academic analytics tools are usually used to predict student success and provide proactive intervention [15] [16] for ongoing and future school events.\nThe lack of metrics and evaluation techniques is a common problem that student organizations and student affairs offices face when attempting to assess how effective and engaging student-organized activities are. Challenges such as lack of available resources, time constraints, and biased activity overseers may impact the accuracy and quality of these activities [17], ultimately hindering the ability to accurately assess their success.\nThere are existing approaches and methodologies that can be used to quantify effectiveness. One of the most common tools used in academia in general [19] is the n-point Likert scale, delivered as a feedback form to the event attendees post-activity. It can provide valuable insights into areas for improvement and overall satisfaction with the event, but should be used in conjunction with other methods to ensure a comprehensive evaluation, given that it provides data from the attendees' perspective only.\nOne proposed solution is to develop a machine learning-based workflow that can automate data collection and analysis processes, allowing for more efficient and unbiased evaluation of activity success. [18] Data from the event organizers can be gathered and analyzed, aside from the data collected from the attendees. This ensures that both perspectives are considered. While it can be tempting to create and issue a Likert scale-like feedback form to the organizers themselves, their biases to issue \"favorable\" or \"positive\" feedback can skew the results. Hence, a different approach should be explored."}, {"title": "C. On Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning and Python", "content": "One approach is to use Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining[1], which is a technique that involves analyzing written feedback or comments to determine the sentiment or opinion of the respondent. It provides more insight by analyzing open-ended comments and classifying feedback as positive, negative, or neutral, which is not possible with Likert-based scores. Sentiment analysis, along with word clouds, can offer unique insights that go beyond predetermined Likert scale questions [28].\nSentiment analysis has become a popular research area with the rise of user-generated content on the internet. Various techniques have been developed to extract sentiments from text data, including machine learning and lexicon-based approaches. The science has gained more interest in recent years, with a significant increase in related research papers and studies, with more focus on internet-generated text from user comments, product reviews, feedback, and many others [21]. Different levels of sentiment analysis, including document level, sentence level, and word level, have been explored to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment extraction [20]. Machine learning algorithms-supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning-are commonly used to classify sentiments in text data [20]. Benchmark datasets and tools, such as those from Kaggle, Meta (formerly Facebook) [25] and X (formerly Twitter) [26], are utilized for sentiment analysis tasks [20]. They are even used as dataset banks and places for data mining, as they are easily accessible by most people.\nThe Python programming language has also become a popular choice for sentiment analysis due to its simplicity and versatility. It has enabled advancements in Data Science and Machine Learning by providing a powerful and flexible programming language that is popular among data scientists, data engineers, enthusiasts, and hobbyists. It offers various machine learning libraries like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Hugging Face which offer tools and algorithms to simplify the implementation of machine learning-based natural language processing workflows [27]. Overall, sentiment analysis has seen advancements in accuracy and efficiency, despite the ongoing challenges and potential improvements in the field [22] [23] [24] .\nCase in point: implementing a machine learning-based sentiment analysis workflow using the data from event reports, i.e., post-activity reports, from student-organized activities is an opportunity worth exploring. While not a complete replacement for the Likert scale or other evaluation tools, it could provide a more nuanced understanding of participant experiences and feedback from a holistic perspective."}, {"title": "D.

Applications of Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis", "content": "The applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have expanded significantly in recent years, with uses ranging from chatbots and language translation to governance and policymaking [7]. While its increased usage has also led governing bodies to consider regulations and ethical guidelines to ensure its responsible implementation [7], it is evident that the potential for NLP to revolutionize various industries is vast.\nOne approach to NLP that is of interest is Sentiment Analysis (SA), which focuses on analyzing text data to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed within the text. This sentiment consists of a Polarity, or label, e.g., positive, neutral, and negative, and an Intensity, or a numerical value representing the intensity of said sentiment, which can be a scale ranging between zero and one or between zero and one hundred [31]. This approach has led to several use cases of SA geared towards assessing and quantifying the attitude or inclination of people towards a product, service, item, etc. [8] But its use is not limited only to assessing product reviews by consumers; it may also be used by business sectors to enhance forecasting models and gain deeper insights into the market [9]."}, {"title": "B. Sentiment Analysis in Student Extracurricular Activities and Academia", "content": "These papers collectively suggest that SA can be used to improve the quality of students: Iram [3] proposes an automated system to detect students' sentiments expressed in Facebook posts related to curriculum and extracurricular activities. Sirajudeen [4] presents a novel model for topic sentiment analysis in online learning communities that can provide practical references for improving the quality of information services in teaching practice. Atif [5] introduces an enhanced framework for sentiment analysis of students' surveys, aiming to improve student retention, teaching, and facilities. Gkontzis [6] proposes a data mining methodology for sentiment analysis in student forums, which can help assess the effectiveness of the learning environment and improve the overall learning experience. In general, while SA applied to student affairs and student extracurricular activities, i.e., \"outside the classroom,\" was fairly limited at the time and relatively new of a field, there is still relevance for SA to be used within academia. Such approaches still contribute to the advancement of SA techniques in educational settings, ultimately benefiting students and members of the academic community by introducing another tool for assessing student satisfaction and engagement."}, {"title": "C. Pysentimiento Overview and the BERT Large Language Model (LLM)", "content": "Pysentimiento is an (NLP) toolkit in Python designed for opinion mining and Social NLP tasks. Built on top of the HuggingFace's Transformers library, pysentimiento offers a simple API to utilize pre-trained Language models for sentiment analysis and other social NLP tasks. By selecting datasets for specific tasks and language pairs, pre-processing them for model training, fine-tuning various underlying models, comparing their performance, and integrating the best models into the toolkit, pysentimiento provides an accessible and efficient solution for extracting opinions and information from user-generated text across multiple languages. [32]\nThe study uses the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Large Language Model (LLM) called via the pysentimiento toolkit, as a Transformer pipeline in Hugging Face. BERT is a transformer-based pre-trained language model that has significantly improved performance on various natural language processing tasks. It is trained with two learning objectives: masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP) to learn semantic information within and between sentences. BERT models are widely used in the NLP community for their effectiveness in understanding language semantics and context [33]. One of its advantages over other pre-trained LLMs is its high accuracy and performance, especially for social media data like X tweets. Although unrelated to the study, BERT LLM models can handle different languages and dialects as they are trained on multilingual data, making them suitable for analyzing sentiment in text written in various languages [34].\nBERT is used in the study over other available LLMs such as LLaMA 2, FALCON, and BLOOM because not only is"}, {"title": "V.WORKFLOW OVERVIEW, AND DATA & RESULTS OVERVIEW", "content": "This section explains the designed workflow using the Hugging Face Transformer pipeline, the key features used in Sentiment Analysis (SA), and the results of NLP-SA using the sample dataset."}, {"title": "A.

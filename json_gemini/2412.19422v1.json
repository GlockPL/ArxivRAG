Most methods in previous studies learn the semantics and syntax of molecular structures by analyzing molecular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings; however, they do not take into account the drug responses of the biological systems consisting of genes and proteins. In this study we propose a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, which utilizes gene expression profiles to generate molecular structures with desirable phenotypes for arbitrary target proteins. In the algorithm, a variational autoencoder is employed as a feature extractor to learn the latent feature distribution of the gene expression profiles. Then, a long short-term memory is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature conditions of the gene expression profile extracted by the feature extractor. Experimental results and case studies demonstrate that the proposed Gx2Mol model can produce new molecules with potential bioactivities and drug-like properties.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Exploring the chemical space to discover molecules with therapeutic effects (e.g., anticancer drug production) is a time-consuming, costly, and high-risk task in the drug discovery field. Despite extensive premarket drug testing, the failure rate is still > 90% [1], [2]. In general, drug development takes over 12 years and costs greater than $1.3 billion [3], [4], [5]. After identification of therapeutic target proteins for a disease of interest, researchers search for potential drug candidate molecules that can interact with the therapeutic target proteins. This process is referred to as hit identification [6], [7]. The high-throughput screening of large-scale chemical compound libraries with various biological assays is often performed for the hit identification, but the experimental approach is quite expensive.\nAs an alternative to hit identification, computational methods such as virtual screening [8], [9] and de nov\u03bf molecular generation [10], [11] can be used to accelerate the production of drug candidate molecules. Virtual screening attempts to explore chemical databases containing massive volumes of molecules at minimal cost and obtain hit-like molecules through ligand-based similarity search or dock- ing simulation [12]. De novo molecular generation attempts to generate new molecules with desired chemical properties or similar to known ligands [13], [14]. Recently, artificial in- telligence and deep learning-based generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) [15], [16] and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [17], [18], [19] have emerged for the de novo molecular generation. However, most meth- ods in the previous studies focused on learning the syntax and semantics of molecular structures by analyzing molec- ular graphs or simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings.\nThe biological system is perturbed by drug treatment, thus, the use of biological data in addition to chemical data is desired for drug discovery. Omics data including tran- scriptome offer a comprehensive molecular landscape that can describe the cellular responses of human cells to drug treatment and the pathological histories of disease patients. Thus, omics data representing drug activities are important resources for current drug development. For example, the use of gene expression data in the preliminary stage of drug discovery is a promising approach [20], because it does not depend on prior knowledge of ligand structures or three-dimensional (3D) structural information of thera- peutic target proteins [21], [22]. However, omics-based drug discovery approach has severe limitations. The number of molecules with omics information is quite limited; thus, the method is applicable only to molecules for which omics data are measured. Deep learning-based methods have been de- veloped to generate hit-like molecules from gene expression data using GAN [23] and VAE [24], but generated molecules tend to be chemically invalid or have unrealistic structures, thus, there remain room in terms of accuracy improvement.\nIn this study, we present a deep generative model, Gx2Mol, to analyze omics data and design new drug struc- tures to overcome the above problems. Specifically, a VAE model is utilized as a feature extractor to learn the low- dimensional features of the gene expression profile data. Then, a long short-term memory (LSTM) [25], [26], [27] model is leveraged as the chemical generator to produce syntactically valid SMILES strings that satisfy the feature"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, our emphasis is on conducting a compre- hensive review of previous studies encompassing various molecular generation approaches.

Experienced chemists use their knowledge to design molecules, modify existing structures based on medicinal chemistry principles, synthesize diverse compound libraries through combina- torial chemistry, and leverage structural information for targeted design.\nHowever, these conventional methods exhibit limita- tions. Human bias and intuition, inherent in chemical de- sign, may restrict the exploration of vast chemical space. Traditional approaches are time-consuming, expensive, and may not efficiently explore diverse molecular structures for high-throughput screening [1]. Predicting bioactivity based solely on chemical intuition can be challenging, and conven- tional methods struggle to capture complex relationships between molecular structures and biological activities [2]."}, {"title": "2.2 Deep Learning-based Molecular Generation", "content": "To tackle these challenges, deep learning-based de novo molecular generation, a relatively recent field of research, integrates the capabilities of machine learning and high- throughput data analysis techniques. Its primary objective is to generate new molecules with desired bioactivities, uti- lizing molecular graphs, Self-referencing embedded strings (SELFIES) [31], and SMILES strings as the primary data types in drug design processes [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. These methods offer the potential to explore broader regions of chemical space, predict bioactivity more accurately, and expedite the drug discovery process."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Graph-based Methods", "content": "Molecular graphs contain rich structural information and are often used for molecular generation and drug design [32]. Typically, a molecular graph is usually represented by an ensemble of atom vectors and bond matrices. VAE mod- els attempts to approximate the distribution of molecular graphs to learn latent variables [33], [34].\nGenerally, VAE-based models construct molecular graphs with a tree structure and employ an encoder to extract the molecular graph features and represent them as low-dimensional latent vectors. Then, the VAE decoder is employed as a molecular generator to reconstruct atoms in the tree into molecules via the latent vector representa- tion. The design of graph-based generators is challenging; thus, GAN-based molecular generation models are rare. The molecular GAN (MolGAN) method [17] generates new graphs with the maximum likelihood of atoms and chemical bonds by sampling atomic features and chemical bond feature matrices. In addition, an actor-critic [38] reward network is used to calculate the property scores of the generated graphs. However, MolGAN suffers from a severe mode collapse, thereby causing its uniqueness to be less than 5%. ALMGIG [39], which is an extension of the bidirec- tional GAN model that generates new molecules by learning distributions in the molecular space using adversarial cyclic consistency loss.\nFlow-based molecular generative models, exemplified by MoFlow [35], initially produce bonds (edges) using a Glow-based model. Subsequently, atoms (nodes) are gener- ated based on the established bonds through a novel graph conditional flow. Finally, these components are assembled into a chemically valid molecular graph, with posthoc valid- ity correction. Diffusion-based molecular generative mod- els, such as DiGress [37], are based on a discrete diffusion process. Graphs are iteratively modified with noise through the addition or removal of edges and changes in categories."}, {"title": "2.2.2 SMILES-based Methods", "content": "De novo drug design using SMILES strings attempts to generate new molecules with desired properties [40], [18], [41]. For example, GrammarVAE [40] is a SMILES-based model that is used to generate molecular structures, where a VAE is used with a grammar-based decoder that gen- erates syntactically valid SMILES strings. This model is trained on a dataset of existing molecules and generates new molecules with high structural diversity. In addition, Tran- SORGAN [18] is a transformer-based GAN model designed to generate diverse molecules that are similar to the source molecules. In the TransORGAN model, the transformer architecture and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network are employed as the generator and discriminator, respectively, and the Monte Carlo policy gradient algorithm [42] is used to explore new molecules with high chemical"}, {"title": "2.2.3 SELFIES-based Methods", "content": "Introduced more recently, SELFIES [31] tackles the challenge of string invalidity at a profound level by purportedly offer- ing representations for all molecules, thereby guaranteeing the validity of every SELFIES string. Each symbol within a SELFIES string is derived from a rule vector that precisely denotes the chemical structure type, such as [C] for carbon atoms or [=O] for double-bonded oxygen, while the state of derivation encapsulates both syntactic and chemical con- straints, including considerations like maximal valency [43]. This robust framework ensures the integrity and reliability of SELFIES representations. This makes SELFIES particu- larly suitable for machine learning applications in chemistry. The flexibility of SELFIES enables the encoding of complex molecular structures. FastFlows [36] utilizes normalizing-flow based models, SELFIES, and multi-objective optimiza- tion to generate small molecules. Notably, it can produce thousands of chemically valid molecules within seconds, even with an initial training set as small as 100 molecules.\nWhile SELFIES has showcased remarkable efficacy in molecular representation, and a comprehensive library\u00b9 is available for the translation between SMILES strings and SELFIES representations [44], it nonetheless exhibits cer- tain limitations. Firstly, the representation of SELFIES is characterized by a relatively high level of complexity and low interpretability, especially when dealing with advanced molecular grammar. This complexity and interpretability often poses challenges in accurately deciphering certain se- quences [45]. In contrast, SMILES strings offer advantages in widespread adoption, conciseness, and ease of readability. Secondly, unlike SMILES strings, which focus on encoding the semantics of molecules, SELFIES is primarily designed to generate strings representing syntactically valid molecu- lar structures [46], [47]. The intricate semantics of SELFIES entail that even subtle adjustments in syntax can lead to the generation of molecular structures that are significantly divergent in terms of their chemical composition, functional groups, and overall properties [48]. Also, SELFIES faces limitations in fully representing certain macromolecules and crystals, particularly those comprised of large molecules or characterized by intricate bonding patterns [44].\nBased on the above considerations, SMILES strings maintain their position as a reliable option for molecular representation, providing a robust framework for various cheminformatics applications. Thus, in this study, we em- ploy SMILES strings as the choice for molecular generation."}, {"title": "2.3 Omics Data-driven Molecule Generation", "content": "To date, most methods in previous studies generated hit- like molecules based on a learning set of ligand structures and bioactivities, where the structures are represented by graphs or SMILES strings. Diverging from conventional approaches, omics data-driven hit-like molecule genera- tion endeavors to leverage omics data, specifically gene expression profiles. The overarching goal is to generate hit molecules that exhibit promising biological activity against specific targets, such as proteins or enzymes associated with particular diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there are limited studies that have explored drug design directly from omics data [23], [24].\nGenerally, omics-based methods can generate hit-like molecules without prior knowledge of ligand structures and the 3D structure of the target proteins. A conditional Wasserstein GAN combined with a gradient penalty was proposed to generate hit-like molecules from noise using gene expression profile data [23], which is referred to as ConGAN in this study. However, the validity of the gener- ated candidate molecules is not guaranteed, thereby limit- ing the hit identification ability. In addition, the prediction process of transcriptional correlation between ligands and targets is unclear. TRIOMPHE [24] is a VAE-based molecular generation model using transcriptional correlation between the gene expression profile with the perturbation of a ther- apeutic target protein and the gene expression profile with the treatment of small molecules. The most similar molecule is selected as the source molecule, the source molecule is projected to the latent space using a VAE encoder, and a decoder is used to sample and decode the latent vectors into new molecules. However, in their work, gene expression profiles were solely employed in correlation calculations for selecting SMILES strings before inputting them into the VAE model. During the molecular generation phase, gene expression profiles were not utilized to guide the generation of hit-like molecules. Consequently, the molecules generated using TRIOMPHE exhibited low Tanimoto coefficients com- pared to the corresponding known ligands.\nNote that, unlike the previously mentioned de novo molecular generative models, the proposed Gx2Mol aims to generate hit-like molecules that exhibit promising bio- logical activity against specific target proteins or particular diseases, utilizing information from gene expression pro- files. Gx2Mol initially extracts biological features from gene expression profiles using a VAE model. Subsequently, these extracted features serve as conditions for the conditional LSTM model, guiding the generation of hit-like molecules."}, {"title": "3 PROPOSED MODEL", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Gx2Mol", "content": "The proposed Gx2Mol comprises two main components. The feature extractor (i.e., the VAE model) is employed to extract the features of the gene expression profiles, and the generator (i.e., the conditional LSTM model) is used to generate hit-like molecules based on the extracted features of gene expression profiles.\nWe aim to generate hit-like molecules from gene expres- sion profiles. High-dimensional gene expression profiles present formidable challenges attributed to the presence of noise and redundant information. Employing a VAE model for feature extraction and selection from such intricate datasets emerges as a strategic solution. VAEs, belonging to the category of generative models, possess the capabil- ity to comprehend the complexities of high-dimensional data by acquiring a lower-dimensional representation while encapsulating its inherent structure. This method serves as an effective means to navigate and mitigate the issues associated with noise and redundancy in gene expression profiles. The subsequent elucidation highlights the versatile application of VAEs in overcoming these challenges.\n\u2022 Dimensionality reduction: VAEs can effectively reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional gene expression profiles by learning a compressed and meaningful rep- resentation in the latent space. The encoder part of the VAE maps the input gene expression profiles to a lower- dimensional latent space, capturing essential features.\n\u2022 Noise reduction: VAEs are designed to model the under- lying distribution of the data. This can help in filtering out noise and capturing the intrinsic patterns present in the gene expression profiles. The generative nature of VAEs encourages the model to focus on the most salient features while ignoring noise.\n\u2022 Feature extraction: The latent space learned by the VAE can be considered as a set of extracted features that represent the essential information in the gene expression profiles. These features can serve as a more compact and informative representation of the data compared to the original high-dimensional space."}, {"title": "3.2 Extraction of Biological Features", "content": "The architecture of the Gx2Mol model is illustrated in Figure 1. In phase (A), we initiate the process by training a VAE model, extracting essential biological features from gene expression profiles. The encoder network transforms the features of gene expression profiles into a low-dimensional latent space, which is subsequently reconstructed by the decoder. Post the training phase, only the encoder is utilized for subsequent downstream tasks.\nFormally, let $G = [g_1,g_2,\u2026\u2026,g_T]$ indicate the gene expression profile, where $g_i$ represents the i-th gene with the maximum gene number of T. The VAE model serves as a feature extractor in our Gx2Mol model, tasked with learning a latent feature distribution denoted as $p(z|G)$. The objective is to align this distribution as closely as possible to the reference distribution $p(z)$, characterized as an isotropic normal distribution. This alignment occurs through the approximation of observed gene expression profiles, while reinforcing the stochastic independence among latent vari- ables. The utilization of the VAE model in this manner facilitates the extraction of meaningful latent features from the input data, as demonstrated in Figure 1 (A). This visu- alization provides a tangible representation of how the VAE contributes to capturing essential characteristics within the gene expression profiles. High-dimensional gene expression profile reconstruction can be modeled by the integration of the low-dimensional feature space $p(z)$ and conditional distribution $p_\u03b8(G|z)$ parameterized by \u03b8:\n$p_\u03b8(G) = \\int p_\u03b8(G|z)p(z)dz.$\nTo address the intractable issue of the posterior distribu- tion $p_\u03b8(z|G)$, the feature extractor replaces $p_\u03b8(z G)$ by an approximate variational distribution $q_{\u03b8'}(z|G)$. Typically, $q_{\u03b8'}(z|G)$ and $p_\u03b8(G|z)$ are used as the encoder and decoder of a VAE, respectively. According to the evidence lower bound [49], the loss function of the feature extractor can be formulated as follows:\n$L_F(\u03b8,\u03b8') = - E_{z\u223cq_{\u03b8'}(z|G)} [log p_\u03b8(G|z)] +\u03b2\u22c5D_{KL}(q_{\u03b8'}(z|G)||p(z)),$\nwhere $E[]$ and \u03b2 indicate an expectation operation and the weight of the Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{KL}$ [50], respectively. The VAE encoder generates both a mean (\u03bc) and a variance (\u03c3\u00b2) for each point in the latent space, typically following a Gaussian distribution. For a given gene expression profile G, calculated as follows:\n$q_{\u03b8'}(z|G) = N (\u03bc(G), \u03c3\u00b2(G)),$\nwhere \u03bc(G) and \u03c3\u00b2(G) are the mean and variance functions parameterized by the encoder.

During phase (B), we incorporate the corresponding SMILES strings as inputs for LSTM train- ing.

The gene expression profiles for the first eight proteins were obtained from gene knockdown profiles of the MCF7 cell line, while those for the latter two proteins were obtained from gene overexpression profiles.

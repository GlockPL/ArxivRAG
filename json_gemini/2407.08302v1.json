It is used among others \u2013 for inferring conclusions in decision making prob-\nlems [8, 28, 21] and for resolving conflicts of opinion in persuasion and negotiation dialogues [35, 6]. It represents\nknowledge in argumentation graphs with arguments as nodes and a binary attack relation for conflicts between pieces\nof information. Different semantics can then be applied on those graphs to obtain rational conclusions. In this paper,\nwe focus on gradual semantics which evaluate and score each argument w.r.t. \"how much\" it is attacked by other\narguments.\nRecently, explainable AI has garnered more attention for its ability to provide transparency and enhance the under-\nstandability of AI-based models and algorithms. Among the existing notions of explainability in the literature [27, 38],\ntwo notions seem pivotal to paving the way toward explaining the outcomes of argument evaluation: Causality [22]\nand Feature Attribution [34, 26]. Causality refers to the ability to explain the link between what is introduced as input\nand what results as output. Feature attribution means assessing the contribution of input features (e.g., the age or\nthe blood pressure) to the output (e.g., the probability of getting sick) by assigning attribution scores to each feature,\navoiding the need to explore the model's internal mechanisms.\nHence, we argue that \u2013 working toward making argumentation interpretable \u2013 it is essential that the evaluation of\nan argument can be explained by highlighting the attribution of each argument's interconnected network to its final\nevaluation.

We believe that there is still the need to\nexplore other impact measures that have not been yet considered for gradual semantics. For this reason, this paper\naddresses the need for enhanced impact measures, bringing modifications to existing functions while introducing novel\nones. Our study navigates the intricate landscape by first revising the impact measure defined in [15]. Additionally, we\ndefine a complementary impact measure based on the Shapley Contribution Measure [37, 5]. These impact measures\ncan be used to assess the impact of an argument (or set of arguments) on a given argument for any existing gradual\nsemantics, clarifying and explaining their contributions on the score of another argument.\nThe primary contributions of this paper culminate in three facets. First, the enhancement of an existing impact measure\nand the definition of a novel impact measure based on Shapley Contribution Measure. Second, the introduction of nine\nprinciples for evaluating each (impact, semantics) pair and a full analysis of two impact measures under some well-\nknown gradual semantics. Lastly, the implementation of an online prototype platform where users can input their\nargumentation graphs, compute the acceptability degrees for a gradual semantics, and obtain the output of our new\nimpact measures.\nWe start with a comprehensive review of existing literature and methodologies (Section 2), transitioning into the\nmodification and definition of impact measures (Section 3). Subsequently, we analyse our findings through the defined\nprinciples by analysing their satisfiability by different (impact, semantics) pairs (Section 4). The paper concludes by\nsummarising the implications of our work and outlining future directions in this evolving landscape (Section 5)."}, {"title": "2 Background Knowledge", "content": "We introduce the argumentation concepts used in this paper.\nDefinition 1 (Argumentation Framework). An argumentation framework (AF) is $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, where $A$ is a finite set\nof arguments and $C \\subseteq A \\times A$ is a set of attacks between arguments.\nThe set of all direct attackers of $x \\in A$ will be denoted as $Att(x) = \\{y \\in A \\mid (y,x) \\in C\\}$. Given two AFS\n$\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and $\\textbf{AS}' = (A', C')$, $\\textbf{AS} \\oplus \\textbf{AS}'$ is the AF $(A\\cup A', C\\cup C')$. For any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and $X \\subseteq A$,\n$\\textbf{AS}|_X = (X, C \\cap (X \\times X))$. The set of external attackers of $X$ is $Arg^\\texttt{}(X) = \\{y \\in A\\setminus X \\mid \\exists x \\in X s.t. (y, x) \\in C\\}$.\nThe set of external attacks to $X$ is the set of attacks from an argument in $Arg^\\texttt{}(X)$ to an argument in $X$ and is formally\ndefined as follows: $Att^\\texttt{}(X) = \\{(y,x) \\in C \\mid y \\in Arg^\\texttt{}(X) \\text{ and } x \\in X\\}$. Let $x, y \\in A$, a path from $y$ to $x$ is a\nsequence $(x_0,...,x_n)$ of arguments such that $x_0 = y$, $x_n = x$ and $\\forall i \\text{ s.t. } 0 < i < n, (x_i, x_{i+1}) \\in C$.\nThe attack structure of an argument $x$ is a set of arguments that contains $x$ and all the (direct or indirect) attackers and\ndefenders of $x$.\nDefinition 2 (Attack Structure). Let $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF and $x \\in A$. The attack structure of $x$ in $\\textbf{AS}$ is\n$Stras(x) = \\{x\\} \\cup \\{y \\in A \\mid \\text{ there is a path from y to x}\\}$.\nExample 1. Consider the AF $\\textbf{AS} (A,C)$ represented in Figure 1. We have $Att(a_4) = \\{a_3, a_5, a_8\\}$,\n$Arg^\\texttt{}(\\{a_5, a_{10}\\}) = \\{a_9\\}$, $Att^\\texttt{}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\}) = \\{(a_9, a_5), (a_9, a_{10})\\}$, $Stras(a_3) = \\{a_1,a_2, a_3\\}$ and $Stras(a_4) =$\n$\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_8, a_9, a_{10}\\}$.\nThe usual Dung's semantics [16] induces a two-levels acceptability of arguments (inside or outside of one or all\nextensions). Gradual semantics (and ranking-based semantics) have been proposed as a more fine-grained approach\nto argument acceptability [1, 12]. These semantics use a weighting to assign to each argument in the argumentation\nframework a score, called (acceptability) degree.\nDefinition 3 (Weighting). A weighting on a set $X$ is a function from $X$ to $[0, 1]$.\nDefinition 4 (Gradual semantics). A gradual semantics is a function $\\sigma$ which associates to each $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, a\nweighting $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}: A \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ on $A$. $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}(a)$ is called the degree of $a$."}, {"title": "", "content": "Let us now recall some well-known gradual semantics studied in the literature [7, 10, 30].\nThe h-categoriser semantics (Hbs) assigns a value to each argument by taking into account the sum of degrees of its\nattackers, which themselves take into account the degree of their attackers.\nDefinition 5 (h-categoriser). The h-categoriser semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Hbs}$ s.t. for any $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and\n$a \\in A$:\n$\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Hbs}(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{b \\in Att(a)} \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Hbs}(b)}$\nThe Card-based semantics (Car) favors the number of attackers over their quality. This semantics is based on a\nrecursive function which assigns a score to each argument on the basis of the number of its direct attackers and their\ndegrees.\nDefinition 6 (Card-based). The Card-based semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Car}$ s.t. for any $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and\n$a \\in A$:\n$\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Car}(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + |Att(a)| + \\frac{\\sum_{b \\in Att(a)} \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Car}(b)}{|Att(a)|}}$\nThe Max-based semantics (Max) favors the quality of attackers over their number. The degree of an argument is based\non the degree of its strongest direct attacker.\nDefinition 7 (Max-based). The Max-based semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Max}$ s.t. any $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and $a \\in A$:\n$\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Max}(a) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\max_{b \\in Att(a)} \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{Max}(b)}$\nThe last gradual semantics we study is the counting semantics (CS) [32]. It assigns a value to each argument by\ncounting the number of their respective attackers and defenders. An AF is considered as a dialogue game between\nthe proponents of a given argument $x$ (i.e., the defenders of $x$) and the opponents of $x$ (i.e., the attackers of $x$). Thus,\nthe degree of an argument is greater if it has many arguments from proponents and few arguments from opponents.\nFormally, they first convert a given AF into a matrix $M_{n \\times n}$ (where $n$ is the number of arguments in AF) which\ncorresponds to the adjacency matrix of AF (as an AF is a directed graph). The matrix product of $k$ copies of $M$,\ndenoted by $M^k$, represents, for all the arguments in AF, the number of defenders (if $k$ is even) or attackers (if $k$ is\nodd) situated at the beginning of a path of length $k$. Finally, a normalization factor $N$ (e.g., the matrix infinite norm) is\napplied to $M$ in order to guarantee the convergence, and a damping factor $\\alpha$ is used to have a more refined treatment\non different length of attacker and defenders (i.e., shorter attacker/defender lines are preferred).\nDefinition 8 (Counting model). Let $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ be an argumentation framework with $A = \\{x_1,..., x_n\\}$, $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$\nbe a damping factor and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The $n$-dimensional column vector $v$ over $A$ at step $k$ is defined by,\n$\\mathbf{\\alpha^k} = \\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i \\alpha^i \\overline{M}^i \\textbf{I}$\nwhere $\\overline{M} = M/N$ is the normalized matrix with $N$ as normalization factor and $\\textbf{I}$ as the $n$-dimensional column vector\ncontaining only 1s.\nThe counting model of $\\textbf{AS}$ is $v_\\alpha = \\lim_{k \\to +\\infty} v^k$. The degree of $x_i \\in A$ is the $i$th component of $v_\\alpha$, denoted by $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}^{CS}(x_i)$.\nTogether with the introduction of these semantics, a number of properties have been defined for gradual semantics\nto evaluate their behaviours (see [7, 11] for an overview). Two of the most well-known are called Independence and\nDirectionality. The former ensures that the calculation of the acceptability degrees in two disconnected AFs should be\nindependent while the latter ensures that the acceptability degree of an argument should only rely on the arguments\nwith a directed path to it.\nProperty 1 (Independence [7]). A semantics $\\sigma$ satisfies Independence iff for any two AFs $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C), \\textbf{AS}' =$\n$(A', C')$, where $A\\cap A' = \\emptyset$, for every $y \\in A, \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}(y) = \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS} \\oplus \\textbf{AS}'}(y)$.\nProperty 2 (Directionality [7]). A semantics $\\sigma$ satisfies Directionality iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C), \\textbf{AS}' = (A, C \\cup$\n$\\text{\\{(b, x)\\}})$, for every $y \\in A$ such that there is no path from $x$ to $y, \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}}(y) = \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}'}(y)$.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the counting semantics is the only one in the literature not to satisfy these two properties.\nHowever, we have chosen to include this semantics in our study because the approach used differs from the other\ngradual semantics studied (Hbs, Car and Max), which all satisfy Independence and Directionality.\nProposition 1.

To capture\nthis notion of deletion, two deletion operators need to be defined. The argument deletion operator $\\oplus_A$ aims to delete a\nset of arguments from a given argumentation framework. These changes have also a direct impact on the set of attacks\nbecause the attacks directly related to the deleted arguments (attacking as well as attacked) are automatically deleted\ntoo.\u00b9 The attack deletion operator $\\oplus_C$ focuses only on the removal of a set of attacks from the initial argumentation\nframework, thus keeping the same set of arguments.\nDefinition 10 (Deletion operator). Let $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF, $X \\subseteq A$ be a set of arguments, $R \\subseteq C$ be a set of\nattacks and $y \\in A$.

Let $\\textbf{AS} = (A, C)$ be an AF, $y \\in A$ and $X \\subseteq A$. Let $\\sigma$ be a gradual semantics. $ImpDV$ is defined\nas follows:\n$ImpDV_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, y) = \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}\\oplus Att^\\texttt{}(X)}(y) - \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}\\oplus X}(y)$\nAlthough this definition works well in general, there are particular cases (e.g., when self-attacks are allowed or when\nthe direct attackers of $X$ impact $y$ via other paths) where the result does not correspond to what is expected. For\nexample, if we take $\\textbf{AS}, = (\\{a\\}, \\{(a, a)\\})$, applying Definition 11 with the h-categoriser semantics (any other seman-\ntics gives the same result), we obtain $ImpDV_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a\\}, a) = 0$ because it is not possible to delete the argument whose\nimpact we want to evaluate (otherwise we can no longer calculate its degree with the gradual semantics). This result\ncan be considered counter-intuitive because the degree of $a$ is not maximal and the only argument who can have an\nimpact on its degree is $a$ itself.\nWe propose a revised version of $ImpDV$ which takes into account this case and other problems while retaining the idea\nof the proposed approach. Thus, instead of removing all the direct attackers from $X$ (i.e., using $\\oplus_A$), we remove the\ndirect attacks on each argument of $X$ (i.e., using $\\oplus_C$).\nDefinition 12 (Revised version of $ImpDV$).

We display the values of the revised impact of a set $X$ on an\nargument $y$ in Table 1. Using the same examples of Table 1, the original impact measure of [15] would yield the same\nvalues with the exception of the impact of $\\{a_1\\}$ on $a_4$ with a value of 0. To understand this difference, let us first note\nthat we need to compute the score of $a_4$ when $a_2$ is removed (because $Arg^\\texttt{}(\\{a_1\\}) = \\{a_2\\}$). Since $a_1$ and $a_2$ are\nsymmetrical in terms of attacks received and given (i.e. they attack each other and both attack $a_3$), the impact of $\\{a_1\\}$\non $a_4$ is equal to 0. As for the revised impact measure, it yields 0.015 because the revised measure solves the problem\nraised in the scenario where \"the direct attackers of $X$ impact $y$ via other paths\". Indeed, removing only the attack\nfrom $a_2$ to $a_1$ allows the attacks $(a_1,a_2)$, $(a_2, a_5)$ and $(a_2, a_3)$ to be maintained. Hence the acceptability degree of\n$a_4$ when removing $(a_2, a_1)$ is different from the acceptability degree of $a_4$ when removing $a_1$, resulting in a non-null\nimpact value of $\\{a_1\\}$ on $a_4$.\nNote that for CS, in order to limit the problem related to its violation of the Independence property (because of the\nnormalisation factor N), we have adopted the same approach as [15], i.e. N is the same for the two subgraphs\nconstructed in Definition 12."}, {"title": "3.2 Impact measure based on Shapley value", "content": "In an argumentative setting, the Shapley contribution measure was used to calculate the contribution of direct attackers\non an argument [5]. In this sub-section, we define an impact measure based on this measure. This allows for the\ncalculation of the impact of any set of arguments on another argument.\nGiven a gradual semantics that satisfies the Attack Removal Monotonicity property (see Property 3 below), we recall\nthat the Shapley measure is a function that associates to each attack a number in [0, 1] such that for each argument, the\nloss in its acceptability is equal to the sum of the values of all the attacks toward it. The general intuition underlying\nthis property is that attacks cannot be beneficial for arguments.\nProperty 3 (Attack Removal Monotonicity [5]).

We agree with that conjecture and, from our imple-\nmentations and experiments, we hypothesise that the max-based and card-based semantics also satisfy Property 3.\nHowever, due to its nature, we show that the counting semantics does not satisfy Property 3 (see Example 3).\nExample 3. Consider the two AFs $\\textbf{AS}_1$ and $\\textbf{AS}_2$ depicted in Figure 2. We see that $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}_2}^{CS}(a_3) = 0.26$ is strictly higher\nthan $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS}_1}^{CS}(a_3) = 0.02$.\nLet us now formally define the Shapley measure."}, {"title": "", "content": "Definition 13 (Extended Shapley measure).

Indeed, since the counting semantics does not\nsatisfy Property 3, applying the Shapley measure can result in attacks with negative contributions. Namely, the attacks\nwith negative contributions are attacks that increase the degree of the target argument. In Figure 2 (right), the attack\n$(a_2, a_3)$ increases the degree of $a_3$ by 0.11 but $(a_1, a_3)$ decreases the degree of $a_3$ by 0.85, resulting in a degree of 0.26.\nThis new extended Shapley measure allows to highlight this surprising behaviour of gradual semantics which was not\npossible with the old version. However, note that if a gradual semantics satisfies Attack Removal Monotonicity, then\nthe value returned by the Shapley measure will remain in the interval [0, 1].\nIn the next definition, we define the Shapley-based impact measure based on this extended Shapley measure. To\ncompute the impact of any set of arguments $X$ on an argument $y$, the Shapley-based impact measure considers, for\neach argument $x$ in $X$, the difference between the contribution of even paths and odd paths from $x$ to $y$.\nDefinition 14 (Shapley-based impact measure).

Since $ImpSI_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_{10}\\},a_4) \\neq 0$, it holds that $ImpSI_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_5\\}, a_4) \\neq ImpSI_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_5, a_{10}\\},a_4)$. In\nthe case of the revised version of $ImpDV$, the impact of a set $X$ on $y$ is the difference in acceptability degree\nof $y$ between when the direct external attacks on $X$ are removed and when $X$ is removed. Here, we have that\n$\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS} \\oplus C Att^\\texttt{}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\})}(a_4) = \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS} \\oplus C Att^\\texttt{}(\\{a_5\\})}(a_4)$ and $\\sigma_{\\textbf{AS} \\oplusC \\{a_5\\}}(a_4) = \\sigma_{\\textbf{AS} \\oplus C \\{a_5,a_{10}\\}}(a_4)$, thus the equality.\nFor the max-based semantics, the impact of some set of arguments (e.g. $\\{a_1\\}$ or $\\{a_5, a_6\\}$) on $a_4$ is neutral when\n$ImpDV$ is used. This is not the case when $ImpSI$ as this measure is based on the extended Shapley measure which\nnever assigns a value of 0 to any attacks (for the semantics considered). Apart from these two cases, we note that the\npolarity of the impact (i.e., positive or negative) is often the same for our two approaches, given a set of arguments $X\nand a gradual semantics $\\sigma$ that satisfies Attack Removal Monotonicity.\nOur aim is now to provide a principle-based study to compare these impact measures to explain the common features\nand the differences observed in this sub-section."}, {"title": "4 Desirable principles for impact measures", "content": "Impact measures are usually defined in a general way and can be paired with any gradual semantics (see e.g. [15]).\nIn the rest of this section, we define the desirable principles of a pairing of an impact measure Imp with a gradual\nsemantics $\\sigma$, denoted $Imp^\\sigma$. Namely, $Imp^\\sigma$ takes as input any AF $\\textbf{AS}$ and returns $Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}$.\nThe reason that we do not define the desirable principles at the level of the impact measure itself is that many of the\ndesirable behaviour that we would expect from an impact measure can disappear if the gradual semantics is ill-defined\n(e.g. if it does not satisfy anonymity).

Please\nnote that this principle is inspired from [15] but we generalise it to any sets instead of singleton sets. While this\nprinciple makes it easier to explain the impact of a set using the impact of its individual elements, it also prevents the\nmodelisation of complex behaviour such as accrual.\nPrinciple 3 (Balanced Impact). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Balanced Impact iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, the following holds:\n$\\forall X \\subseteq A, x' \\in A \\setminus X, a \\in A, Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, a) + Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{x'\\}, a) = Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X\\cup \\{x'\\}, a)$.\n\u00b2For a function $f$ and the set $X$, we use the standard notation $f(X)$ to mean $\\{f(x) \\mid x \\in X\\}$."}, {"title": "", "content": "Void Impact states that an empty set of arguments has no impact on an argument.\nPrinciple 4 (Void Impact). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Void Impact iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, any $a \\in A, Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\emptyset, a) = 0$.\nImpact Directionality states that the impact of a set of arguments $X$ on an argument $a$ remains unchanged in the case\nof adding an attack in which the target argument is not connected to $a$ via a path.\nPrinciple 5 (Impact Directionality). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Impact Directionality iff for any two AFs $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and $\\textbf{AS}' =$\n$(A, C\\cup \\{(b, x)\\})$, for any $a \\in A$, if there is no path from $x$ to $a$, then for all $X \\in A, Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, a) = Imp_{\\textbf{AS}'}^{\\sigma}(X, a)$.\nImpact Minimisation captures the fact that the impact of a set of arguments $X$ on an argument $a$ can be reduced to a\nminimal subset of $X$ from which arguments with no path to $a$ have been removed.\nPrinciple 6 (Impact Minimisation). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Impact Minimisation iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, any $X \\subseteq A, x' \\in$\n$X$ such that there is no path from $x'$ to $a$, and $a \\in A$, it holds that $Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, a) = Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X \\setminus \\{x'\\}, a)$.\nZero Impact states that the impact of an argument $x$ on an argument $a$ is zero if $x$ is not connected to $a$ by a path.\nPrinciple 7 (Zero Impact). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Zero Impact iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$ and $a, x \\in A$, if there is no path\nfrom $x$ to $a$ then $Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{x\\}, a) = 0$.\nImpact Symmetry says that if there is an automorphism between the attack structures of two arguments $a$ and $b$, then\nthe impact of a set of arguments $X$ on $a$ is the same as the impact of the set containing the image of each argument of\n$X$ on $b$.\nPrinciple 8 (Impact Symmetry). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Impact Symmetry iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, any $a, b \\in A$, the\nfollowing holds: if $f$ is an automorphism from $\\textbf{AS}|_{str(a)\\cup Str(b)}$ to $\\textbf{AS}|_{str(a)\\cup Str(b)}$ such that $f(a) = b$ and $f(b) = a$,\nthen for all $X \\in A, Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, a) = Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(f(X \\cap (Str(a) \\cup Str(b))), b)$.\nExample 5.

This principle is inspired from [24] and ensures that impact measures that always\nreturn 0 are not desirable. Without loss of generality, this principle can be easily generalised to gradual semantics\nwhich maximal value is not 1.\nPrinciple 9 (Impact Existence). $Imp^\\sigma$ satisfies Impact Existence iff for any AF $\\textbf{AS} = (A,C)$, any $a \\in A$, the following\nholds: if $\\sigma(a) \\neq 1$ then there exists $X \\in A$ such that $Imp_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(X, a) \\neq 0$."}, {"title": "4.2 Links between principles", "content": "Although most of our principles are independent, some of them are related because they deal with neutral impact\nwhere there is no path between the arguments whose impact we want to calculate and the target argument.

A number of axiomatic studies have\nbeen carried out on these semantics in order to guarantee correct behaviour, but also to better understand the results\nreturned.

This choice is motivated\nby the fact that some of these semantics (such as h-categoriser and CS) have already been studied both axiomatically\nand in association with an existing impact measure, and the others have only been studied axiomatically but have\nunique features (such as the use of max to aggregate attacker degree) that we thought would be interesting to study in\nthis work. We are aware that there exist other gradual semantics defined in the literature that could have been studied,\nbut the idea was not to study them all but to show that, despite the different behaviors of these semantics, our impact\nmeasures can be applied to any gradual semantics.\nTheorem 11. The principles of Table 3 hold.\nWe can observe that $ImpDV^\\sigma$ and $ImpSI^\\sigma$ both satisfy Impact Anonymity, Void Impact, Impact Minimisation, Zero\nImpact and Impact Symmetry for$\\sigma\\in \\{\\sigma_{Hbs}, \\sigma_{Car}, \\sigma_{Max}, \\sigma_{CS}\\}$.\nThe principles that are not satisfied by $ImpDV^\\sigma$ and $ImpSI^\\sigma$ include Impact Independence and Impact Directional-\nity only for CS. This can be explained by the behaviour of CS that does not satisfy the Independence and the Di-\nrectionality properties. The main axiomatic difference between the two measures concerns the Balanced Impact\nprinciple because $ImpSI$ satisfies this principle whatever the gradual semantics used in our study, whereas this\nis never the case for $ImpDV$. The AF depicted in Figure 4 shows, for example, that $ImpDV_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\},a_4) \\neq$\n$ImpDV_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_5\\},a_4) + ImpDV_{\\textbf{AS}}^{\\sigma}(\\{a_{10}\\}, a_4)$ for $\\sigma\\in \\{\\sigma_{Hbs},\\sigma_{Car},\\sigma_{Max}, \\sigma_{cs}\\}$. Note also that, although [15, Proposition\n2] states that Balanced Impact is satisfied by the original definition of $ImpDV$ (cf. Definition 11), this AF can also\nbe used as a counterexample to prove that it is not satisfied.\nMoreover, while most of the proofs have been done on general graphs, we have proved the satisfaction of Impact\nExistence for $ImpSI^{\\sigma_{CS}}$ only on the class of graphs where there are at least two arguments with the maximum in-\ndegree, however we conjecture that Impact Existence is also satisfied in the general case.\nThis principle compliance study can be helpful for choosing which (impact, semantics) pair to use for a specified\napplication. It is interesting to note here that this choice depends on two factors: The satisfiability of the Balanced\nImpact principle and the satisfiability of the Impact Independence and the Impact Directionality principles.

Although their work is also inspired by\nfeature attribution explanation methods in machine learning, Yin et al. focus on highlighting the sensitivity of a topic\nargument's final acceptability degree w.r.t. the other arguments' initial weights. Their impact measure is defined only\nfor individual arguments, in acyclic QBAFs and only for the DF-QuAD semantics. However, our two impact measures\nare both defined for any set of arguments and can be paired with any gradual semantics. Moreover, the properties they\nstudy are explanation-focused, used to assess and characterise their impact measure's ability of providing robust and\nfaithful explanations. These properties are mostly inspired by properties for machine learning models' explanations\nsuch as sensitivity and fidelity. Here, we propose contribution-focused properties, meaning that we evaluate how each\npair (impact, semantics) contributes to the final acceptability degree of an argument, w.r.t. the argumentation graph's\nstructure. However, we also intend to explore the explanation-focused properties in future work.

We also note that while they also introduce a\nShapley-based contribution, its computation necessitate the addition of the source argument to all possible subgraphs\nthat already contain the topic argument. We argue that this is more computationally expensive than our Shapley-based\nimpact measure which is based on [5].\nThe notion of impact for gradual semantics has also been studied by Himeur et al. [23]. They measured the impact\nof agents on arguments in a debate, allowing to identify the agent that is the most influential for a specified argument.\nAlthough the impact measure defined returns the individual impact of an argument on another argument, they defined\ndifferent aggregation functions that can be used to merge the impact of all the arguments belonging to the same agent,\non a particular argument. The impact measure of Himeur et al.

There are now an increasing number of gradual semantics and\nimpact measures that have emerged to facilitate the interpretation of their outcomes. An impact\nmeasure assesses, for each argument, the impact of other arguments on its score. In this paper, we\nrefine an existing impact measure from Delobelle and Villata and introduce a new impact measure\nrooted in Shapley values. We introduce several principles to evaluate those two impact measures\nw.r.t. some well-known gradual semantics. This comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights\ninto their functionality and desirability.\n\nKeywords Gradual semantics Impact measures \u00b7 Argumentation Principle-based approach", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Computational argumentation theory stands as an important domain of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in knowl-\nedge representation and reasoning. It is used among others \u2013 for inferring conclusions in decision making prob-\nlems [8, 28, 21] and for resolving conflicts of opinion in persuasion and negotiation dialogues [35, 6]. It represents\nknowledge in argumentation graphs with arguments as nodes and a binary attack relation for conflicts between pieces\nof information. Different semantics can then be applied on those graphs to obtain rational conclusions. In this paper,\nwe focus on gradual semantics which evaluate and score each argument w.r.t. \"how much\" it is attacked by other\narguments.\nRecently, explainable AI has garnered more attention for its ability to provide transparency and enhance the under-\nstandability of AI-based models and algorithms. Among the existing notions of explainability in the literature [27, 38],\ntwo notions seem pivotal to paving the way toward explaining the outcomes of argument evaluation: Causality [22]\nand Feature Attribution [34, 26]. Causality refers to the ability to explain the link between what is introduced as input\nand what results as output. Feature attribution means assessing the contribution of input features (e.g., the age or\nthe blood pressure) to the output (e.g., the probability of getting sick) by assigning attribution scores to each feature,\navoiding the need to explore the model's internal mechanisms.\nHence, we argue that \u2013 working toward making argumentation interpretable \u2013 it is essential that the evaluation of\nan argument can be explained by highlighting the attribution of each argument's interconnected network to its final\nevaluation. Namely, this is achieved by providing to the user an impact measure that returns the contribution of\ndifferent arguments to the argument's final evaluation.\nFew impact measures have been defined in the literature [31, 15, 23, 39]. We believe that there is still the need to\nexplore other impact measures that have not been yet considered for gradual semantics. For this reason, this paper\naddresses the need for enhanced impact measures, bringing modifications to existing functions while introducing novel\nones. Our study navigates the intricate landscape by first revising the impact measure defined in [15]. Additionally, we\ndefine a complementary impact measure based on the Shapley Contribution Measure [37, 5]. These impact measures\ncan be used to assess the impact of an argument (or set of arguments) on a given argument for any existing gradual\nsemantics, clarifying and explaining their contributions on the score of another argument.\nThe primary contributions of this paper culminate in three facets. First, the enhancement of an existing impact measure\nand the definition of a novel impact measure based on Shapley Contribution Measure. Second, the introduction of nine\nprinciples for evaluating each (impact, semantics) pair and a full analysis of two impact measures under some well-\nknown gradual semantics. Lastly, the implementation of an online prototype platform where users can input their\nargumentation graphs, compute the acceptability degrees for a gradual semantics, and obtain the output of our new\nimpact measures.\nWe start with a comprehensive review of existing literature and methodologies (Section 2), transitioning into the\nmodification and definition of impact measures (Section 3). Subsequently, we analyse our findings through the defined\nprinciples by analysing their satisfiability by different (impact, semantics) pairs (Section 4). The paper concludes by\nsummarising the implications of our work and outlining future directions in this evolving landscape (Section 5)."}, {"title": "2 Background Knowledge", "content": "We introduce the argumentation concepts used in this paper.\nDefinition 1 (Argumentation Framework). An argumentation framework (AF) is $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$, where $A$ is a finite set\nof arguments and $C \\subseteq A \\times A$ is a set of attacks between arguments.\nThe set of all direct attackers of $x \\in A$ will be denoted as $Att(x) = \\{y \\in A \\mid (y,x) \\in C\\}$. Given two AFs\n$\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ and $\\mathcal{AS}' = (A', C')$, $\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus \\mathcal{AS}'$ is the AF $(A\\cup A', C\\cup C')$. For any AF $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ and $X \\subseteq A$,\n$\\mathcal{AS}|_X = (X, C \\cap (X \\times X))$. The set of external attackers of $X$ is $Arg^-(X) = \\{y \\in A\\setminus X \\mid \\exists x \\in X \\text{ s.t. } (y, x) \\in C\\}$.\nThe set of external attacks to $X$ is the set of attacks from an argument in $Arg^-(X)$ to an argument in $X$ and is formally\ndefined as follows: $Att^-(X) = \\{(y,x) \\in C \\mid y \\in Arg^-(X) \\text{ and } x \\in X\\}$. Let $x, y \\in A$, a path from $y$ to $x$ is a\nsequence $(x_0,...,x_n)$ of arguments such that $x_0 = y$, $x_n = x$ and $\\forall i \\text{ s.t. } 0 < i < n, (x_i, x_{i+1}) \\in C$.\nThe attack structure of an argument $x$ is a set of arguments that contains $x$ and all the (direct or indirect) attackers and\ndefenders of $x$.\nDefinition 2 (Attack Structure). Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF and $x \\in A$. The attack structure of $x$ in $\\mathcal{AS}$ is\n$Str_{\\mathcal{AS}}(x) = \\{x\\} \\cup \\{y \\in A \\mid \\text{ there is a path from } y \\text{ to } x\\}$.\nExample 1. Consider the AF $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$. We have $Att(a_4) = \\{a_3, a_5, a_8\\}$,\n$Arg^-\\{a_8, a_{10}\\} = \\{a_9\\}$, $Att^-\\{a_8, a_{10}\\} = \\{(a_9, a_8), (a_9, a_{10})\\}$, $Str_{\\mathcal{AS}}(a_2) = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$ and $Str_{\\mathcal{AS}}(a_4) =$\n$\\ {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_8, a_9, a_{10}\\}$.\nThe usual Dung's semantics [16] induces a two-levels acceptability of arguments (inside or outside of one or all\nextensions). Gradual semantics (and ranking-based semantics) have been proposed as a more fine-grained approach\nto argument acceptability [1, 12]. These semantics use a weighting to assign to each argument in the argumentation\nframework a score, called (acceptability) degree.\nDefinition 3 (Weighting). A weighting on a set $X$ is a function from $X$ to $[0, 1]$.\nDefinition 4 (Gradual semantics). A gradual semantics is a function $\\sigma$ which associates to each $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$, a\nweighting $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS}}: A \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ on $A$. $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS}}(a)$ is called the degree of $a$."}, {"title": "Impact for Gradual Semantics", "content": "An impact measure is a function that informs on how a set of arguments \u201cimpacts\" the score of a specific argument. In\nthis paper, it returns a value within the interval [-1, 1], reflecting the impact of the set and its overall polarity (negative,\npositive or neutral).\nDefinition 9 (Impact measure). Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF and $\\sigma$ be a gradual semantics. An impact measure $Imp$\ntakes as input $\\mathcal{AS}$ and $\\sigma$ and returns a function $Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}: 2^A \\times A \\rightarrow [-1,1]$. For any $X \\subseteq A, y \\in A, Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X,y)$\nis the impact of $X$ on $y$ (in $\\mathcal{AS}$ w.r.t. semantics $\\sigma$).\nIn sub-section 3.1, we explain the drawbacks of the impact measure by Delobelle and Villata [15] and introduce a\nrevised version. We also motivate and showcase a new Shapley-based impact measure in sub-section 3.2.\nNote that these two impact measures have been implemented and deployed in an online platform prototype, accessible\nat https://impact-gradual-semantics.vercel.app/.\n3.1 Revised version of impact measure from Delobelle and Villata\nIn [15], the impact of an argument (or a set of arguments) on a target argument can be measured by computing the\ndifference of acceptability degree of the target argument when this element exists and when it is deleted. To capture\nthis notion of deletion, two deletion operators need to be defined. The argument deletion operator $\\oplus_A$ aims to delete a\nset of arguments from a given argumentation framework. These changes have also a direct impact on the set of attacks\nbecause the attacks directly related to the deleted arguments (attacking as well as attacked) are automatically deleted\ntoo.\u00b9 The attack deletion operator $\\oplus_C$ focuses only on the removal of a set of attacks from the initial argumentation\nframework, thus keeping the same set of arguments.\nDefinition 10 (Deletion operator). Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF, $X \\subseteq A$ be a set of arguments, $R \\subseteq C$ be a set of\nattacks and $y \\in A$. The argument deletion operator $\\oplus_A$ is defined as $\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus X = (A', C')$, where\n$\\bullet A' = A\\setminus (X\\cup\\{y\\});$\n$\\bullet C' = \\{(x, z) \\in C \\mid x \\in A\\setminus X, z \\in A\\setminus X\\}$.\nThe attack deletion operator $\\oplus_C$ is defined as $\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus_C R = (A,C'')$, where $C'' = C\\setminus R$.\nIn [15], to compute the impact of any set of arguments $X$ on an argument $y$, it is proposed to consider the degree of\nacceptability of $y$ when the direct attackers of $X$ are removed (i.e., when the arguments in $X$ are the strongest) from\nwhich the degree of acceptability of $y$ is deducted when all the arguments of $X$ are removed.\nDefinition 11 ([15]). Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A, C)$ be an AF, $y \\in A$ and $X \\subseteq A$. Let $\\sigma$ be a gradual semantics. $Imp^{DV}$ is defined\nas follows:\n$Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X, y) = \\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus Arg^-(X)}(y) - \\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus X}(y)$\nAlthough this definition works well in general, there are particular cases (e.g., when self-attacks are allowed or when\nthe direct attackers of $X$ impact $y$ via other paths) where the result does not correspond to what is expected. For\nexample, if we take $\\mathcal{AS}, = (\\{a\\}, \\{(a, a)\\})$, applying Definition 11 with the h-categoriser semantics (any other seman-\ntics gives the same result), we obtain $Imp^{DV}(\\{a\\}, a) = 0$ because it is not possible to delete the argument whose\nimpact we want to evaluate (otherwise we can no longer calculate its degree with the gradual semantics). This result\ncan be considered counter-intuitive because the degree of $a$ is not maximal and the only argument who can have an\nimpact on its degree is a itself.\nWe propose a revised version of $Imp^{DV}$ which takes into account this case and other problems while retaining the idea\nof the proposed approach. Thus, instead of removing all the direct attackers from $X$ (i.e., using $\\oplus_A$), we remove the\ndirect attacks on each argument of $X$ (i.e., using $\\oplus_C$).\nDefinition 12 (Revised version of $Imp^{DV}$). Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ be an AF, $y \\in A$ and $X \\subseteq A$. Let $\\sigma$ be a gradual\nsemantics. $Imp^{DV}$ is defined as follows:\n$Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X,y) = \\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus CAtt^-(X)}(y) - \\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus_C X}(y)$\nNote that for $\\oplus_A$, it is necessary to specify the argument $y$ for which the degree will be measured, in order to avoid removing\nit from the AF if it belongs to the set of arguments whose impact on $y$ is to be measured."}, {"title": "3.2 Impact measure based on Shapley value", "content": "In an argumentative setting, the Shapley contribution measure was used to calculate the contribution of direct attackers\non an argument [5]. In this sub-section, we define an impact measure based on this measure. This allows for the\ncalculation of the impact of any set of arguments on another argument.\nGiven a gradual semantics that satisfies the Attack Removal Monotonicity property (see Property 3 below), we recall\nthat the Shapley measure is a function that associates to each attack a number in [0, 1] such that for each argument, the\nloss in its acceptability is equal to the sum of the values of all the attacks toward it. The general intuition underlying\nthis property is that attacks cannot be beneficial for arguments.\nProperty 3 (Attack Removal Monotonicity [5]). A semantics $\\sigma$ satisfies Attack Removal Monotonicity iff for any AF\n$\\mathcal{AS} = (A, C)$, for every $a \\in A$, for every $R \\subseteq \\{(x,a) \\mid x \\in Att(a)\\}$, it holds that $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS}}(a) \\leq \\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus_C R}(a)$.\nIn [5], they conjectured that h-categoriser satisfies Property 3. We agree with that conjecture and, from our imple-\nmentations and experiments, we hypothesise that the max-based and card-based semantics also satisfy Property 3.\nHowever, due to its nature, we show that the counting semantics does not satisfy Property 3 (see Example 3).\nExample 3. Consider the two AFs $\\mathcal{AS}_1$ and $\\mathcal{AS}_2$. We see that $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS}_1}^{CS}(a_3) = 0.26$ is strictly higher\nthan $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{AS}_2}^{CS}(a_3) = 0.02$.\nLet us now formally define the Shapley measure."}, {"title": "3.3 Observations", "content": "In Table 2, we provide the impact returned by $Imp^{DV}$ and $Imp^{SI}$ of several sets of arguments on $a_4$ in the AF repre-\nsented in Figure 1. Since those two approaches follow different intuitions, we can make several observations.\nFor example, we can see that, for$\\sigma\\in \\{\\sigma^{Hbs},\\sigma^{Car},\\sigma^{Max},\\sigma^{CS}\\}$, $Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_1\\},a_4) = Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\},a_4)$\nwhereas $Imp^{SI}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_5\\},a_4) \\neq Imp^{SI}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\}, a_4)$. The idea is that the Shapley-based impact measure of\na set on a target argument can be \"decomposed\" as the sum of the impact of each argument of that set on the\nargument. Since $Imp^{SI}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_{10}\\},a_4) \\neq 0$, it holds that $Imp^{SI}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_{5}\\}, a_4) \\neq Imp^{SI}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_{5}, a_{10}\\},a_4)$. In\nthe case of the revised version of $Imp^{DV}$, the impact of a set $X$ on $y$ is the difference in acceptability degree\nof $y$ between when the direct external attacks on $X$ are removed and when $X$ is removed.

This is not the case when $Imp^{SI}$ as this measure is based on the extended Shapley measure which\nnever assigns a value of 0 to any attacks (for the semantics considered). Apart from these two cases, we note that the\npolarity of the impact (i.e., positive or negative) is often the same for our two approaches, given a set of arguments $X\nand a gradual semantics $\\sigma$ that satisfies Attack Removal Monotonicity.\nOur aim is now to provide a principle-based study to compare these impact measures to explain the common features\nand the differences observed in this sub-section."}, {"title": "4 Desirable principles for impact measures", "content": "Impact measures are usually defined in a general way and can be paired with any gradual semantics (see e.g. [15]).\nIn the rest of this section, we define the desirable principles of a pairing of an impact measure $Imp$ with a gradual\nsemantics $\\sigma$, denoted $Imp^{\\sigma}$. Namely, $Imp^{\\sigma}$ takes as input any AF $\\mathcal{AS}$ and returns $Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}$.\nThe reason that we do not define the desirable principles at the level of the impact measure itself is that many of the\ndesirable behaviour that we would expect from an impact measure can disappear if the gradual semantics is ill-defined\n(e.g. if it does not satisfy anonymity). Some of the principles we introduce and use for analysing impact measures under\ngradual semantics are inspired from the property analysis of gradual semantics [4], i.e., the Anonymity, Independence,\nand Directionality properties.\n4.1 List of principles\nUnless stated explicitly, all the principles are defined for an impact measure $Imp$ and a gradual semantics $\\sigma$.\nLet us start by introducing the notion of isomorphism between argumentation frameworks.\nDefinition 15. Let $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$ and $\\mathcal{AS}' = (A',C')$ be two AFs. An isomorphism from $\\mathcal{AS}$ to $\\mathcal{AS}'$ is a bijective\nfunction $f$ from $A$ to $A'$ such that for all $a,b \\in A, (a,b) \\in C \\text{ iff } (f(a), f(b)) \\in C'$. If $\\mathcal{AS} = \\mathcal{AS}'$, $f$ is called an\nautomorphism.\nImpact Anonymity states that the impact of a set of arguments on an argument should not depend on the names of the\narguments.\nPrinciple 1 (Impact Anonymity). $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Impact Anonymity iff for any two AFs $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$, $\\mathcal{AS}' =$\n$(A', C')$, and any isomorphism $f$ from $\\mathcal{AS}$ to $\\mathcal{AS}'$, the following holds: $\\forall X \\subseteq A, a \\in A, Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X,a) =$\n$Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}'}(f(X), f(a))$.\nImpact Independence states that the impact of a set of arguments $X$ on an argument $a$ should not depend on the\narguments which are not connected to $X$ nor to $a$ by a path.\nPrinciple 2 (Impact Independence). $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Impact Independence iff for any two AFs $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$, $\\mathcal{AS}' =$\n$(A', C')$, where $A\\cap A' = \\emptyset$, the following holds: $\\forall X \\in A, a \\in A, Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X, a) = Imp_{\\mathcal{AS} \\oplus \\mathcal{AS}'}(X, a)$.\nBalanced Impact states that the sum of the impact of a set of arguments $X$ and the impact of an argument $x'$ on an\nargument $a$ should be equal to the impact of the union of $X$ with the set containing only argument $x'$ on $a$. Please\nnote that this principle is inspired from [15] but we generalise it to any sets instead of singleton sets. While this\nprinciple makes it easier to explain the impact of a set using the impact of its individual elements, it also prevents the\nmodelisation of complex behaviour such as accrual.\nPrinciple 3 (Balanced Impact). $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Balanced Impact iff for any AF $\\mathcal{AS} = (A,C)$, the following holds:\n$\\forall X \\subseteq A, x' \\in A \\setminus X, a \\in A, Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X, a) + Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{x'\\}, a) = Imp_{\\mathcal{AS}}(X\\cup \\{x'\\}, a)$."}, {"title": "4.2 Links between principles", "content": "Although most of our principles are independent, some of them are related because they deal with neutral impact\nwhere there is no path between the arguments whose impact we want to calculate and the target argument. This is the\ncase with Impact Symmetry and Impact Minimisation which follows from some other principles.\nTheorem 4. Let $Imp$ be an impact measure and $\\sigma$ be a gradual semantics. If $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Impact Anonymity, Impact\nDirectionality, Impact Minimisation, and Impact Independence, then $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Impact Symmetry.\nTheorem 5.

Let $Imp$ be an impact measure and $\\sigma$ be a gradual semantics. If $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Void Impact and Impact\nMinimisation, then $Imp^{\\sigma}$ satisfies Zero Impact.\nAs stated at the beginning of this section, defining principles solely at the level of impact measure is not relevant,\nas the calculation is based on the use of scores returned by gradual semantics. A number of axiomatic studies have\nbeen carried out on these semantics in order to guarantee correct behaviour, but also to better understand the results\nreturned. In this way, it is possible to use the fact that certain properties satisfied by gradual semantics also guarantee\nthe satisfaction of certain principles for $Imp^{DV}$ and $Imp^{SI}$."}, {"title": "4.3 Axiomatic evaluation and discussion", "content": "Table 3 summarizes the results about the axiomatic evaluation of the studied impact measures and gradual semantics.\nThis axiomatic study only takes into consideration the gradual semantics defined in Section 2. This choice is motivated\nby the fact that some of these semantics (such as h-categoriser and CS) have already been studied both axiomatically\nand in association with an existing impact measure, and the others have only been studied axiomatically but have\nunique features (such as the use of max to aggregate attacker degree) that we thought would be interesting to study in\nthis work. We are aware that there exist other gradual semantics defined in the literature that could have been studied,\nbut the idea was not to study them all but to show that, despite the different behaviors of these semantics, our impact\nmeasures can be applied to any gradual semantics.\nTheorem 11. The principles of Table 3 hold.\nWe can observe that $Imp^{DV^{\\sigma}}$ and $Imp^{SI^{\\sigma}}$ both satisfy Impact Anonymity, Void Impact, Impact Minimisation, Zero\nImpact and Impact Symmetry for$\\sigma\\in \\{\\sigma^{Hbs}, \\sigma^{Car}, \\sigma^{Max}, \\sigma^{CS}\\}$.\nThe principles that are not satisfied by $Imp^{DV}$ and $Imp^{SI^{\\sigma}}$ include Impact Independence and Impact Directional-\nity only for CS. This can be explained by the behaviour of CS that does not satisfy the Independence and the Di-\nrectionality properties. The main axiomatic difference between the two measures concerns the Balanced Impact\nprinciple because $Imp^{SI^{\\sigma}}$ satisfies this principle whatever the gradual semantics used in our study, whereas this\nis never the case for $Imp^{DV}$. The AF shows, for example, that $Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_5,a_{10}\\},a_4) \\neq$\n$Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_5\\},a_4) + Imp^{DV}_{\\mathcal{AS}}(\\{a_{10}\\}, a_4)$ for $\\sigma\\in \\{\\sigma^{Hbs},\\sigma^{Car},\\sigma^{Max}, \\sigma^{cs}\\}$. Note also that, although [15, Proposition\n2] states that Balanced Impact is satisfied by the original definition of $Imp^{DV}$ (cf. Definition 11), this AF can also\nbe used as a counterexample to prove that it is not satisfied.\nMoreover, while most of the proofs have been done on general graphs, we have proved the satisfaction of Impact\nExistence for $Imp^{SI^{\\sigma^{CS}}}$ only on the class of graphs where there are at least two arguments with the maximum in-\ndegree, however we conjecture that Impact Existence is also satisfied in the general case.\nThis principle compliance study can be helpful for choosing which (impact, semantics) pair to use for a specified\napplication. It is interesting to note here that this choice depends on two factors: The satisfiability of the Balanced\nImpact principle and the satisfiability of the Impact Independence and the Impact Directionality principles.

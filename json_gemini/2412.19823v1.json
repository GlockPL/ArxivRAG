INTRODUCTION", "content": "The rapid development of wired and wireless network technologies has strengthened the backbone of communication networks for modern ubiquitous connectivity. Notably, communication networks are an enabler for seamless network connections between devices, infrastructure, and systems across varied distances and diverse applications [1]\u2013[4]. These networks span multiple domains, from traditional wired communication networks to modern wireless and mobile network infrastructures, ensuring flawless, pervasive data flow, and massive connectivity to support the communication network ecosystem, while bridging the digital divide. Among the diverse types of communication networks, mobile networks, especially the recent deployment of the Fifth-Generation (5G) and beyond technologies, facilitate high-speed data rate, low latency, high reliability, and wide coverage density applications [5], [6]. For instance, the envisioned Sixth-Generation (6G) network is expected to achieve peak data rates of up to 1 Terabit per second (Tbps), user experience data rate of 1 to 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps), sub-millisecond latency (as low as 0.1 milliseconds), reliability of 99.99999% ("}, {"title": "A. Background", "content": "seven nines\"), and about 10 million device connectivity per square kilometer [7]. In parallel, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm connects billions of devices, ranging from sensors in smart homes to industrial applications such as the Industrial IoT [8]. Vehicular networks are capable of enabling real-time data exchange among vehicles and Roadside Units (RSUs) via Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) or Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technologies [9]. This enhances safety and efficiency in the evolving Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Additionally, cloud-based networks provide centralized, scalable, and abundant computing and storage resources for processing and delivering services in communication networks [10], while fog/edge-based networks bring such processing and services closer to end users by enabling localized processing [11]. With fog/edge-based networks, computation latency and bandwidth consumption are reduced drastically.\nNetwork and Service Management (NSM) in modern communication networks constitutes optimizing the underlying network infrastructure and critical key performance indicators such as latency, bandwidth, energy efficiency, and Quality of Service (QoS) to ensure efficient resource utilization and service continuity [12]\u2013[14]. These management tasks involve monitoring, reporting, planning, deploying, distributing, and continuously supporting the network for full-scale functionality and flexibility. Effective NSM ensures smooth inter-domain service provisioning and efficient utilization of resources. Though closely related, network management and service management focus on different aspects of the communication network. Network management primarily concerns the optimization and maintenance of the underlying physical infrastructure, ensuring that the physical and logical components, such as base stations and routers, operate efficiently [15]- [18]. It handles tasks such as base station siting, cloud data center deployment, and fog node distribution. On the other hand, service management is concerned with the quality and delivery of services provided by the network, ensuring that end users and applications enjoy their desired performance levels [19]-[21]. This includes service provisioning management, adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and ensuring QoS. Thus, while network management caters for the technical performance of the network itself, service management enhances end user experience and the smooth operation of applications and services running on top of the network.\nTraditionally, NSM approaches rely on conventional optimization techniques, e.g., rule-based [22], [23], heuristic-based [24], [25], and static [26], [27] algorithms, which are tailored to address specific network and service challenges like traffic monitoring, network configuration, intrusion detection, root-cause analysis, and security enhancement. Rule-based algorithms use predefined rules to govern management decision-making, e.g., traffic management systems in mobile networks often rely on these rules to dynamically allocate bandwidth resources. Heuristic-based methods are designed to quickly find good enough solutions when the optimal solution is complex or computationally intensive to determine. For instance, cloud-based networks use heuristics to distribute tasks efficiently among servers to minimize latency and energy consumption. Static algorithms tend to assume a controlled environment without frequent changes in network behavior, e.g., in vehicular networks, pre-defined routing and scheduling solutions can be developed using static methods. Although effective in controlled environments, static methods often fall short when faced with highly dynamic, real-world conditions. Despite their maturity and widespread adoption to solve NSM challenges, conventional optimization methods have been proven inadequate for handling the growing complexity of emerging network technologies [28], [29]. The lack of flexibility to adapt to changing infrastructure and resource demand on-the-fly renders them inefficient in today's heterogeneous communication networks.\nTo overcome the challenges faced by conventional optimization techniques, Artificial Intelligence (AI) [30] and Machine Learning (ML) [31] approaches have shown promising signs of enhancing NSM tasks in communication networks. In particular, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved great strides in handling dynamic decision-making in complex and non-stationary network environments. In the context of mobile networks and IoT, DRL has been utilized to optimize resource allocation in the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) [32] and Core Network (CN) [33]. Similarly, in cloud-based [34] and fog/edge-based [35] environments, DRL has enabled more efficient task offloading, ensuring that computational tasks are handled by the most appropriate resources with minimum delay. Despite their strengths, traditional AI/ML algorithms often struggle with unstructured data such as network configuration intents, logs, and multimodal data, which are common in many real-world applications. These models lack the ability to interpret context and relationships between different sources of data, leading to suboptimal decisions in dynamic environments. Moreover, AI/ML models are often highly task-specific, which require retraining and fine-tuning for new tasks and varying network conditions. Their adaptability to evolving environments is limited, and model updates can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\nThe recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in both industry and academia has unraveled endless new possibilities in various research fields [36]\u2013[39]. With its notable success in Natural language Processing (NLP), LLMs can process and generate human-like text, understand complex commands, and make high-level decisions based on input prompts or patterns in the data they train on. Building on their NLP tasks capabilities, LLMs can now handle huge amounts of datasets and derive actionable insights and reasoning to solve real-world problems. Unlike AI/ML algorithms, LLMs excel at processing and understanding unstructured data, particularly natural language. They can analyze data from multiple sources and extract meaningful insights, improving decision-making and troubleshooting in complex systems [40]. Trained on large datasets, LLMs are better equipped to understand context and nuances in data for multi-dimensional decision-making. This allows them to make more informed decisions by considering not only data points but also other relationships, content, and high-level meanings. Specifically, LLMs have the potential to augment NSM by automating network operations, detecting anomalies, and performing predictive maintenance [41], [42].\""}, {"title": "B. Motivation", "content": "The integration of LLMs into communication networks for NSM tasks is becoming increasingly crucial as these networks grow more complex, spanning multiple domains such as mobile, vehicular, cloud-based, and fog/edge-based networks. Considering that NSM plays a critical role in communication networks, it is essential to explore how LLMs can be applied to enhance NSM across the diverse network domains. While existing surveys have focused on the application of LLMs in areas like telecommunications [38], Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) [43], the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) [44], Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [45], Integrated Satellite- Aerial-Terrestrial Networks (ISATNs) [46], Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) [47], and Mobile Edge Intelligence (MEI) [39], separately, there still remains a significant gap in a comprehensive review targeting the potential of LLMs for NSM in communication networks. The existing literature overlooks the broader application of LLMs for optimizing and managing communication networks in domains such as mobile networks and technologies, vehicular networks, cloud-based networks, and fog/edge networks. This survey aims to fill the gap by providing an in-depth review of the role of LLMs in communication NSM. Additionally, it will explore how LLMs can be leveraged to tackle the unique challenges faced in these networks, offering insights into open issues, potential solutions, and future research directions in the field of LLM-driven NSM for communication networks."}, {"title": "C. Related Surveys", "content": "In the recent past, Generative AI (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and LLMs have received enormous attention from researchers in both industry and academia due to their benefits in text generation, task automation, and rich semantic abilities. As such, numerous studies have investigated the potential of these flagship technologies in various domains and application scenarios, including communication networks. Specifically, researchers have surveyed the application of LLMs in specific domains such as ITS [47], ADS [43], IoV [44], telecommunications [38], and the capabilities of techniques such as MEI to complement LLM training and model inference [39], using different taxonomies. Though informative, most of these surveys do not extensively shed light on the potential of LLMs for communication NSM, considering that communication networks require efficient optimization of network resources and appropriate infrastructure distribution and deployment to herald a sustainable network. The work in [48] provided a comprehensive review of LLMs, addressing their foundational concepts, diverse applications, and open challenges that remain in their deployment. This work focused on LLM resources, domain-specific applications, the impact of LLMs on society, and industrial applications of LLMs in biomedical and healthcare, education, social media, business, and agriculture. However, this survey did not emphasize the application of LLMs for communication NSM.\nIn terms of ITS and ADS, several surveys have been conducted to showcase the potential of LLM integration [43], [47], [49]. Shoaib et al. [47] explored the transformative impact of frontier AI, FMs, and LLMs on ITS. The survey focused on the dynamic synergy between LLMs and ITS, investigating their roles and delving into applications in traffic management, integration into autonomous vehicles, and their role in shaping smart cities, while addressing challenges brought by frontier AI and FMs. Specific use cases such as traffic prediction and management, sentiment analysis of social media data for traffic insights, emergency response and disaster management, and multimodal transportation planning were considered, highlighting impressive research findings and how LLMs are employed to solve these problems in ITS. The work in [49] systematically surveyed the integration of LLMs in autonomous driving and mapping systems context, highlighting the current landscape of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their applications, existing tools, datasets, and benchmarks available in the domain. Some authors [43] comprehensively reviewed the architectures, tools, and frameworks of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and MLLMs, collectively referred to as XLMs in the context of ADS. This survey discussed deployment strategies for the effective integration of XLMs into autonomous driving frameworks under the taxonomy of prompt-engineering-based, fine-tuning-based, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)-based, and LLM and GAI-based methods.\nExisting research has surveyed the significant potential of LLMs for vehicular network domains such as UAVs [45], ISATNs [46], and IoV [44].

LLM FUNDAMENTALS", "content": "LLMs are a class of ML models that have exceptional capabilities in processing and generating human-like output for tasks across domains such as NLP and computer vision by capturing intricate language patterns [51]. Their capability to learn complex language patterns stems from their extensive training on large-scale datasets, enabling them to generalize across applications. Capitalizing on advanced neural network architectures, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to understand, interpret, and generate language with a level of contextual understanding that often surpasses traditional models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Notably, LLMs have demonstrated exceptional performance in a broad range of NLP tasks, e.g., text classification [52], question-answering (Q&A) [53], and sentiment analysis [54]. Their capabilities now go beyond NLP, expanding into other domains of computer vision, e.g., image recognition [55], object detection [56], and multimodal applications, positioning them as versatile, scalable tools for a range of complex tasks.\nThe LLM architecture is built on transformers [57], which leverage attention mechanisms to capture intricate dependencies between inputs and outputs to learn real relationships"}, {"title": "A. Transformer Architecture", "content": "The transformer architecture consists of several interconnected components that enable it to process sequential data with high efficiency and accuracy. The core components of a transformer architecture are the input layer, embedding layers (input and output embeddings), positional encoding layers, encoder and decoder modules (containing self-attention mechanisms and normalization layers), and output layer, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In the following, we present the function of each component:\n\u2022 Input layer: The input layer is where raw data is parsed as tokens into the transformer. For language-related tasks, the input generally consists of a sequence of tokens, such as words, subwords, or characters, that represent the text to be processed by the model. The tokens are typically mapped from a vocabulary to numerical indices that the model can interpret.\n\u2022 Embedding layers: The transformer architecture consists of the input embedding layer and output embedding layer. The input embedding layer precedes the encoder and converts tokens from the input sequence into dense vector representations. These embeddings allow the model to understand the semantic relationships between tokens, which are essential for capturing contextual information. On the other hand, the output embedding layer exists after the decoder and converts the model's internal continuous representations back into discrete tokens in the output vocabulary, typically in the form of probabilities for each token.\n\u2022 Positional encoding layer: Since transformers process tokens in parallel, they lack the ability to order tokens. The positional encoding layer solves this issue by providing the position of tokens in a sequence, preserving sequential information.\n\u2022 Encoder and decoder modules: The encoder and decoder modules comprise multiple identical self-attention, feed-forward neural network layers, and normalization layers. The encoder module processes the input sequence"}, {"title": "B. General-purpose vs. Domain-specific LLMs", "content": "LLMs have shown enormous potential in their application in various language-related tasks, from open-ended dialogue generation to high-level specialized technical tasks. Specifically, LLMs can be characterized by the application scenarios they are designed for, the tasks they are able to execute, the kind of datasets required to train them, and the knowledge base they can access. Based on these factors, LLMs can be broadly divided into two categories, namely, general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific LLMs. General-purpose LLMs are designed to handle a wide array of language tasks across various domains. Examples of common general-purpose LLMS are GPT-4 [58], developed by OpenAI; Mistral 7B [60], developed by Mistral AI; LLaMA-3 [59], developed by Meta; Turing-NLG [61], developed by Microsoft; and Gemini [62], developed by Google DeepMind. Domain-specific LLMs are tailored to excel in particular fields or domains by integrating specialized knowledge from the domain. Examples are TelecomGPT [71] for telecom-specific tasks, DriveGPT4 [66] for autonomous driving and transportation-related tasks, and ChatDoctor [63] for medical-oriented tasks. In the following, we discuss general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs considering application scenarios, datasets, tasks, and knowledge base:\n1) General-purpose LLMs: General-purpose LLMs are versatile models trained on dense datasets spanning multiple domains. This allows them to perform a broad spectrum of language-related tasks. For instance, GPT-4 [58] is trained on broad internet data, books, articles, and code repositories with approximately 1.8 trillion parameters to generalize well across different topics, making them applicable to a variety of scenarios. Turing-NLG [61] is trained on a massive text corpus collected by Microsoft with 17 billion parameters for text generation, question answering, and summarization. Their adaptability comes from exposure to vast, heterogeneous datasets, enabling them to understand, generate, and adapt language across contexts. The main purpose of general-purpose LLMs is to provide a reliable, adaptable tool that can respond efficiently to different prompts without being constrained by any specific domain.\n\u2022 Application scenarios: General-purpose LLMs are deployed in diverse applications, including conversational AI, customer service chatbots, summarization, translation, and Q&A systems. With their flexible knowledge base, general-purpose LLMs are suitable for open-ended scenarios where the input can vary significantly. Jiang et al. [60] introduced Mistral 7B, a state-of-the-art language model comprising 7 billion parameters designed to achieve high performance in general NLP tasks in research and enterprise applications. The Gemini Team at Google [62] presented Gemini, a family of multimodal models that demonstrate advanced capabilities in understanding and processing image, audio, video, and text data for application scenarios such as complex question-answering and dialogue systems.\n\u2022 Datasets: The training data of general-purpose LLMs is typically extensive and heterogeneous, encompassing sources such as books, websites, news articles, and code repositories. This diverse corpus ensures that the model is exposed to varied topics and contextual knowledge. The data is generally unfiltered for specific domains, allowing these models to learn broadly applicable language patterns. For example, GPT-4 trains on broad internet data, books, articles, and code repositories, while LLaMA trains on public internet text and academic resources.\n\u2022 Tasks: General-purpose LLMs are optimized to handle a wide range of tasks, including text completion, summarization, text classification, and information retrieval. They are commonly used for more advanced functions like reasoning, natural language inference, and zero-shot learning, where the model makes inferences on tasks it has not been explicitly trained on. These capabilities make them powerful for research and daily language tasks.\n\u2022 Knowledge base: Due to broad data exposure, general-purpose LLMs exhibit a balanced understanding of many fields. The knowledge is often cross-disciplinary, covering general knowledge base in language structure, scientific concepts, and even technology knowledge.\nGeneral-purpose LLMs have the advantage of performing a wide range of tasks due to their heterogeneous knowledge base. However, their broad knowledge scope often sacrifices specialty. That is, they may lack the intricate details needed for specialized technical or scientific inquiries. For instance, Turing-NLG [61], which is trained on Microsoft's large text corpus and performs well for text generation, summarization, and Q&A tasks, may not suffice in vehicular network environments that primarily utilize video and image data for more"}, {"title": "C. Model Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning", "content": "Model pre-training and fine-tuning are foundational processes in the development of LLMs [76]. Pre-training and fine-tuning enable LLMs to learn from extensive datasets from different sources and adapt to specific tasks. If done appropriately, LLMs can yield highly versatile and powerful outcomes after being pre-trained and fine-tuned. Pre-training provides LLMs with a generalized understanding of language and patterns, equipping them with a broad representation of learning knowledge, reasoning, and comprehension capabilities. On the other hand, fine-tuning refines this knowledge, adapting the model to specialized tasks or application domains, which achieves significant performance improvements across a range of applications.\n1) Model pre-training: Model pre-training is the initial phase of LLM development, during which the model is exposed to extensive amounts of unlabeled data to learn general language patterns, contextual relationships, and semantic understanding. Pre-training a model on extensive datasets allows it to capture complex language patterns, semantic relationships, and general world knowledge, making it more effective when applied to specific tasks. This approach significantly reduces the data and computational resources required during the fine-tuning phase, as the model already has a basic understanding of the data.\nLLM pre-training involves feeding the model with an enormous amount of data, which the model processes through supervised or self-supervised learning methods. The model predicts missing words (masked language modeling) or next words (causal language modeling) in sentences to encourage it to learn syntactic structures, contextual dependencies, and broader semantic relationships. Over time, it builds a comprehensive understanding of language, enhancing its ability to handle various tasks with minimal domain-specific training.\nThe data for model pre-training may come from various sources such as common crawl [77], Wikipedia dumps, web text [78], video databases (CCTV camera feed) [75], image files, and specific data for application-specific tasks. Common crawl is a widely used corpus that provides an extensive snapshot of the web, covering a vast range of topics and language patterns. Wikipedia dumps are highly structured and factual Wikipedia data that allow LLMs to gain reliable knowledge across diverse subjects. Web text is a curated dataset of high-quality web pages, often used to enhance the model's understanding of conversational language. The choice of dataset for model pre-training depends on whether the LLM is general-purpose or domain-specific. For example, using masked language modeling, BERT [79] was pre-trained on the BooksCorpus and English Wikipedia for tasks requiring sentence-level understanding, such as Q&A and sentence classification. For domain-specific LLMs, it is desirable to pre-train the model with datasets collected from the specific domain. For instance, Mobile-LlaMA LLM [67] was pre- trained on publicly available 5G network datasets (e.g., BGP routing tables, packet capture files, and performance metrics).\nPre-training LLMs are computationally intensive and often require distributed computing on GPU clusters or TPUs to process the massive datasets involved. Distributed computing offers several benefits and techniques to enhance the efficiency and stability of LLM pre-training. Techniques such as data parallelism, model parallelism [80], pipeline parallelism [81], tensor parallelism [82], Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) [83], gradient accumulation, and gradient sharding can be used to enhance LLM pre-training stability, speed, and cost- effectiveness. In data parallelism, the model is duplicated across multiple devices, such as GPUs and TPUs, and each device processes a different mini-batch of data. Gradients are calculated independently on each device and then averaged across all devices before updating the model parameters. Model parallelism divides the model across multiple devices, which is especially useful for very large models that cannot fit in the memory of a single device. Pipeline parallelism divides the model into segments (or stages), with each segment allocated to different devices. As each device completes its segment, it passes the activations to the next device in the pipeline. Tensor parallelism is a fine-grained form of model parallelism where tensors are split across multiple devices. It enables efficient computation of large matrix operations, particularly in dense layers of transformer models, and can lead to substantial performance improvements. ZeRO is an efficient optimizer that shards optimizer states across devices to reduce memory footprint.\nEfficient model pre-training stability can be achieved by carefully selecting key hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, sequence length, attention heads, and dropout rate. For the learning rate, warm-up training steps, adaptive learning rate adjustments, and cosine learning rates [84] can be employed. The batch size can be incremented step by step to enhance the stability of pre-training. A longer sequence length can help capture context but requires more computation. Multiple attention heads in the attention mechanism allow the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, enhancing its contextual understanding. Dropout rate is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, where certain neuron connections are randomly ignored using pre-training.\n2) Model fine-tuning: Model fine-tuning takes a pre-trained LLM and adapts it to perform specific tasks or operate"}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED TAXONOMY OF LLMS FOR NSM", "content": "The communication network ecosystem has evolved over the years, with new and improved applications and services emerging at every phase of the network evolution process. It is envisioned that communication networks will realize tremendous revolution and mature technological advancements every ten years. A notable instance is the maturity of 5G mobile network technology that supports autonomous driving in vehicular networks, which was impossible in the predecessor Fourth Generation (4G) mobile network technology era [113]. To complement critical latency issues in cloud computing technology, edge computing and fog computing technologies have been birthed in the past years. All these developments are a testament to the fact that communication networks have evolved and will continue to improve in the future. With this revolution comes cutting-edge techniques for managing such powerful networks and their services. NSM has improved proportionally to the advancements in the rapid growth of communication networks. From traditional optimization techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [114] to AI/ML methods such as DRL [115] and deep learning-based [116] algorithms, NSM has been successful in managing complex, dynamic infrastructures and applications.\nRecently, LLMs have gained root in their application for NSM in various communication networks. LLMs present a unique transformative approach to NSM, offering significant capabilities in automation, adaptability, and scalability. For instance, Huang et al. [117] posited that LLMs can be effectively adapted for networking applications, facilitating the translation of natural language into network-specific language through techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning and prompt engineering. The proposed ChatNet framework exemplifies this approach by integrating LLMs with external network tools, thereby enhancing efficiency in network planning and addressing the challenges of generalization and integration in existing Al models. Communication network engineering in enterprise settings is characterized by its complexity and susceptibility to errors due to the manual nature of tasks such as designing network topologies and configuring devices. In [118], a multimodal co-pilot utilizing LLM was presented to enhance network design workflows by integrating visual and textual data to interpret and update network configurations according to user intents.\nWhile expanding the capabilities of LLMs in networking, their full-scale introduction into communication networks will transcend complex task features and designs. This section formulates a novel taxonomy that is used to categorize the application of LLMs for communication NSM. We first fragment the categorization considering the diverse networks in the broad scope of communication networks as mobile"}, {"title": "A. LLM for Network Monitoring and Reporting", "content": "networks and IoT technologies, vehicular networks, cloud-based networks, and fog/edge-based networks. Under this main umbrella, the proposed taxonomy discusses LLM-based NSM and related works for each of the different networks in the following aspects: (i) network monitoring and reporting, (ii) Al-powered network planning, (iii) network deployment and distribution, and (iv) continuous network support, as shown in Fig. 5.\nLLMs can play a critical role in network monitoring and reporting by automating and enhancing the detection, analysis, and reporting of network conditions. In communication networks, LLMs can support a variety of monitoring and reporting tasks, such as network intrusion detection, network forecasting, traffic monitoring, and root cause analysis. Network intrusion detection tasks include detecting threats and anomalies and ensuring network security and reliability. For instance, pre-trained general-purpose LLMs can be leveraged to create robust vector embeddings, which capture the semantic content of log messages while adapting to changes in log formats due to software evolutions and mitigating the cold- start problem in cloud environments [119]. LLMs can enhance the capacity for real-time and predictive network analysis that will offer network operators valuable insights into usage trends and potential future network demands. LLMs can be used to effectively predict VNF resource requirements by realizing real-world consumption data [120].\nScene analysis and traffic monitoring examine complex network conditions to identify meaningful patterns or configurations. LLMs can be utilized to accurately detect hazards during the transition to automated traffic by designing digital maps for road conditions for improved routing [42]. When network issues occur, identifying the root cause can be challenging, especially in complex network environments. LLMS can enhance root cause analysis by identifying the underlying issues that caused the network disruptions [121]. For instance, in fog and edge-based networks, LLM could identify if a bottleneck originates at a specific edge node rather than at the cloud, and this could reduce the time spent on troubleshooting.\nIn summary, traditional optimization and ML techniques face limitations in handling unstructured data, such as log messages, which are critical for detecting anomalies and understanding evolving network conditions. These methods often require extensive task-specific feature engineering, struggle with adapting to dynamic changes, and lack the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. LLMs address these challenges with their ability to process unstructured data seamlessly, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and context awareness to deliver real-time insights, predictive analysis, and more efficient troubleshooting, making them indispensable for critical network monitoring and reporting tasks."}, {"title": "B. LLM for Al-powered Network Planning", "content": "AI-powered network planning can leverage machine intelligence to automate and optimize various aspects of network configuration, resource allocation, and incident management."}, {"title": "C. LLM for Network Deployment and Distribution", "content": "Network deployment and distribution involves setting up and distributing network resources, services, and applications across the infrastructure to achieve optimal performance, accessibility, and scalability. With the increased complexity of modern communication networks, effective deployment and distribution are critical for maintaining robust, scalable, and responsive networks. LLMs can facilitate and optimize these tasks by leveraging their enormous data processing and predictive capabilities to streamline deployment, enhance service placement, and manage resources dynamically. For network deployment, LLMs can be combined with RL to optimize wireless network deployment in urban environments [126]. Telecom networks require frequent and precise task execution, including updates, patches, and routine maintenance activities. LLMs can be integrated with telecom network components for data retrieval, planning, and evaluation tasks [127].\nService placement involves determining the optimal locations within the network for deploying services or applications to minimize latency, enhance performance, and maximize resource efficiency. Effective resource management is crucial to maintaining balanced network loads, particularly in environments like cloud, fog, and edge-based networks. To avoid SLA violations and inefficient resource utilization, LLMs can intelligently allocate queries and scale computing resources based on predicted requirements and latency models [128].\nIn summary, traditional and ML techniques often face limitations in addressing the complexity and dynamic nature of modern network deployment and distribution tasks, such as suboptimal resource allocation and static service placement. These methods struggle with adapting to real-time changes in network conditions and require extensive manual intervention for precise configuration and scaling.

It involves activities aimed at adapting to real-time network conditions, identifying and resolving faults, and optimizing the overall network over time. LLMs can enhance continuous network support by automating real-time adjustments and proactively managing faults, thus creating more resilient and adaptive networks. Continuous network support tasks that can be performed by LLMs include network optimization, network intelligence and control, real-time monitoring and adjustments, IoT honeypot, code repair, and fault tolerance management. Network optimization involves adjusting network parameters to achieve optimal performance, often based on varying conditions and demand. LLMs can enable adaptive network optimization by analyzing data in real-time and suggesting adjustments to bandwidth allocation and resource distribution. For instance, LLMs can be integrated into current management and orchestration frameworks to enable the translation of user intents into actionable technical requirements, efficient mapping of network functions to infrastructure, and comprehensive lifecycle management of network slices [129", "130": ".", "131": "."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The convergence of AI and autonomous technologies has revolutionized various industries, including defense and tactical operations. The rise of HAT can be attributed to several factors, including rapid advancements in autonomous technologies and AI [1], the increasing complexity of tasks and environments, the development of more capable autonomous systems, and the increasing availability of data and computing power [2]. As these technologies have become more sophisticated and capable, there has been a growing recognition of the potential collaborations that can be achieved by combining human cognitive abilities with the computational power and efficiency of autonomous systems [3]. The rise of modern HAT systems has also been driven by the need to address the complexities and challenges of rapidly evolving and dynamic environments. As tasks become more complex, time-sensitive, and data-intensive, the collaboration between humans and autonomous agents becomes crucial for effectively navigating and responding to these challenges.\nHAT is an emerging field that explores collaborative partnerships between humans and autonomous systems to perform tasks or achieve common goals [2], [4]\u2013[6]. This involves a collaborative arrangement in which at least one human worker collaborates with one or more autonomous agents [2]. This collaborative approach has the potential to revolutionize how tasks are accomplished across various sectors and pave the way for a future where humans and intelligent autonomous systems will work hand in hand to tackle complex problems and achieve shared goals. HAT systems are designed to allow humans to delegate tasks to intelligent autonomous agents while maintaining overall mission control [7]. Autonomous agents, in this context, refer to computer entities with varying degrees of self-governance in decision-making, adaptation, and communication. This definition has been supported by studies conducted by the research works in [8], [9]. The integration of human cognitive capabilities with the computational power and efficiency of autonomous systems in HAT enhances performance, decision-making, and overall system capabilities.\nHere, we define and clarify some key concepts that are fundamental to understanding the scope and context of this study. These concepts include AI, Autonomy, Autonomous Systems, and Tactical Autonomy. By providing clear definitions and distinguishing between these terms, we aim to establish a common understanding among our readers.\nAutonomy. Autonomy in the context of HAT describes the ability of intelligent autonomous systems or agents to operate and make decisions independently in a team setting with varying degrees of self-governance [3], [10]. This involves a higher degree of decision-making capability in autonomous systems based on learning, adaptation, and reasoning. It is a property of a system, not a technology itself [10]. An autonomous entity can perceive, reason, plan, and act in pursuit of specific goals or objectives without constant human intervention. It is important to note that the level of autonomy can vary, ranging from fully autonomous systems that make all their decisions to semi-autonomous systems that require human input at certain points [10]. In the context of tactical autonomy, HAT involves the integration of autonomous capabilities into tactical operations. This integration can include various applications, such as using autonomous systems to gather intelligence, perform"}, {"title": "Autonomous Systems", "content": "Autonomous systems can perform tasks or operations without constant human control. They utilize AI algorithms and sensors to perceive and navigate their environment, achieving a high degree of autonomy [11]."}, {"title": "Tactical Autonomy", "content": "In this study, tactical autonomy refers to autonomous systems' ability to make real-time decisions and take actions in dynamic and complex operational environments [12]. This involves the seamless coordination and interaction between humans and autonomous systems, enabling them to function as a unified team with complementary strengths [12]. HAT focuses on achieving shared mission goals through seamless coordination and collaboration between human operators and intelligent autonomous systems [13]. This paper introduces an AI-driven HAT, which integrates AI into HAT frameworks. This approach improves decision-making, situational awareness, and operational effectiveness by combining the strengths of human expertise and AI capabilities. Tactical autonomy, which combines human cognitive abilities, such as adaptability, intuition, and creativity, with the computational power, precision, and dynamic execution of autonomous systems, has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including defense, emergency response, law enforcement, and hazardous environments [12]. It is important to differentiate between tactical and strategic autonomy to clarify how AI-driven human-autonomy teaming contributes to both levels of autonomy in military and operational contexts. Strategic autonomy refers to a nation or organization's ability to make autonomous choices regarding broad security goals, whereas tactical autonomy, in contrast to strategic autonomy, focuses on individual units or teams acting independently within a specific mission [14]. Strategic autonomy involves higher-level decision-making and planning that considers long-term goals, overall mission objectives, and broader situational awareness. It addresses the coordination, allocation of resources, and strategic decision-making processes that guide the overall mission or campaign [14]."}, {"title": "Tactical Operations", "content": "Tactical operations involve coordinated activities in a specific area or environment, typically in a military, law enforcement, or strategic context, focusing on achieving short-term objectives through rapid decision-making, adaptation to dynamic situations, and the application of military skills and resources within a localized area and timeframe [15].\nIn recent years, advancements in AI, Machine Learning (ML), robotics, and sensor technologies have paved the way for realizing the potential of tactical autonomy [12]. These technological advancements have enabled autonomous systems to perform complex tasks, process vast amounts of data in real-time, make informed decisions, and collaborate with human team members seamlessly [12]. This has opened new possibilities for augmenting human capabilities, optimizing resource allocation, and improving overall operational efficiency. However, effective tactical autonomy requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics between humans and autonomous systems. Human factors, including trust, communication, shared situational awareness, and decision-making, play a vital role in ensuring successful HAT. Challenges such as establishing appropriate levels of trust, addressing potential cognitive biases, managing workload distribution, and maintaining effective communication channels must be carefully addressed to ensure seamless collaboration and maximize the potential benefits of tactical autonomy. HAT for tactical autonomy is a collaborative approach to using humans and autonomous systems to operate and control weapons and other military systems. In HAT, the human operators and autonomous systems work together to achieve common goals. The human operators are responsible for the overall mission and making high-level decisions. Autonomous systems are responsible for performing assigned tasks.\nAs explained in detail in Section IV, human operators contribute strategic insight, context, and high-level decision-making capabilities based on their experience and understanding of the mission's goals. The interaction and communication represent the interfaces and communication channels through which each component exchanges information, collaborates, and makes joint decisions. Within the context of a shared decision-making process, human operators and autonomous systems engage in a collaborative decision-making process, sharing insights, data, and recommendations to formulate effective strategies. The autonomous system is responsible for real-time data processing, analysis, and execution of specific tasks supporting human operators with timely and pertinent information. Subsequently, once decisions are made, the autonomous system performs specific tasks, including reconnaissance, navigation, or data collection, in alignment with the directives of the shared decision-making process.\nThis paper comprehensively explores the historical development and current state of HAT and delves into the opportunities, challenges, and potential future directions in leveraging AI for tactical autonomy. It emphasizes the transformative impact of AI on tactical autonomy and presents opportunities for improved decision-making, situational awareness, and resource optimization. By acknowledging and addressing the challenges associated with AI adoption, and by charting future directions for research, we can pave the way for a future where humans and autonomous systems"}, {"title": "A.

MOTIVATION", "content": "In this section, we describe the motivation for the integration of AI solutions within HAT, highlighting their transformative impact on collaboration, communication, and coordination in dynamic and complex tactical environments.\nHAT is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to combine the strengths of humans and autonomous systems to achieve common goals. In recent years, the convergence of AI and HAT has emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach with the potential to revolutionize decision-making, situational awareness, and operational efficiency in dynamic and complex tactical environments. In tactical autonomy, HAT revolutionizes how humans and machines work together in dynamic and complex environments. The integration of AI solutions into HAT offers a compelling avenue to enhance the strengths of both human operators and intelligent autonomous systems, which is promising to advance tactical autonomy. This paper underscores the significance of this integration and presents opportunities, challenges, and directions for future work. We envision a landscape in which the symbiotic relationship between humans and autonomous systems can reshape tactical decision-making, enhance situational awareness, and maximize operational efficiency. By focusing on its transformative impact, this paper sets the stage for a future where collaboration, communication, and coordination in dynamic and complex tactical environments can be elevated to new heights, ultimately contributing to safer and more successful mission outcomes.\nCollaboration. At the core of AI-driven HAT lies a new era of collaboration that redefines the possibilities of human operators and intelligent autonomous systems working together [22]. AI technologies serve as bridges that enhance collaboration by boosting human capabilities through data-driven insights and analytical power [23]. By seamlessly integrating AI solutions into the decision-making process, HAT systems can leverage real-time data analysis, predictive analytics, and pattern recognition to provide human operators with a comprehensive and dynamic understanding of the tactical situation [23]\u2013[26]. This improved collaboration enables operators to make informed decisions more quickly, which is often critical in tactical environments where split-second choices can impact mission success [24]\u2013[26].\nCommunication. Effective teamwork relies on empowering communication, and within the context of tactical autonomy, the integration of AI introduces a new dimension to this foundational aspect [27]. NLP and intelligent communication interfaces enable HAT systems to facilitate seamless interactions between humans and autonomous agents. Conversational AI, chatbots [28], and language translation tools enable real-time communication [29], transcending language barriers and fostering a more inclusive and collaborative environment. This enhanced communication enables operators to convey complex instructions, receive real-time updates, and seek clarifications, thus simplifying the decision-making processes and reducing ambiguity in high-stress scenarios. As described by Shively et al. [17], HAT also incorporates a bi-directional communication approach, which transforms automation from a tool to a teammate. This dynamic communication enables collaborative problem-solving, enabling seamless interactions and joint decision-making between automated systems and human operators."}, {"title": "Coordination", "content": "In dynamic and complex tactical environments, humans and autonomous systems must effectively coordinate their actions effectively [16]. Precise coordination in dynamic and complex tactical environments requires a level of precision that traditional approaches often struggle to achieve. AI-driven HAT transforms coordination into a finely tuned orchestration of human and autonomous actions. Autonomous agents equipped with reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems can execute tasks with adaptability and accuracy, aligning their actions with human operator intentions. This coordination optimizes resource allocation, minimizes response times, and ensures that tasks are executed efficiently, even in the face of unforeseen challenges. The result is a synchronized team that capitalizes on each member's strengths and operates in harmony to achieve the mission objectives."}, {"title": "III. DELEGATED AUTONOMY IN HAT", "content": "As technology advances, the integration of autonomy into various domains has become more prevalent [30]. Delegated autonomy, which is a critical concept in HAT, entails granting autonomous systems a certain level of decision-making authority while maintaining human oversight based on predefined rules, constraints, or algorithms [31]. The degree of autonomy granted to machines can vary based on task complexity, system capabilities, and the context of the operation. Humans retain the ability to intervene, monitor, and override autonomous decisions when necessary, thus ensuring accountability and preventing potential errors. Delegated autonomy generally refers to the ability or a situation in which a human operator dynamically assigns certain tasks or responsibilities to an autonomous system, thereby allowing the system to operate independently within specified constraints [32]. This can be achieved in various ways, depending on the specific tasks or responsibilities being delegated. The following are some practical examples of delegated autonomy.\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In the field of aviation, UAVs often operate with delegated autonomy. Autonomous drones can follow pre-planned flight paths, avoid obstacles, and adapt to changing weather conditions, while human operators maintain the authority to intervene in situations that require human judgment [33]. Studies have shown that HAT systems can perform effectively in unmanned settings for search and rescue [34], [35], infrastructure inspection [36], [37], and agriculture and traffic monitoring [38], [39].\nRobotic Systems. Robots are being used in various industries, from manufacturing [40], [41] to healthcare [42]. In the context of robotic systems, surgical robots exemplify delegated autonomy in healthcare and other domains [43]. In the context of medical robots, a human surgeon delegates some of their autonomy to the robot, allowing it to perform certain tasks without direct human intervention [44], [45]. Surgeons control robotic arms to perform precise movements during surgeries, while the system's autonomy assists in error correction and stabilizing movements. Some of the benefits of medical robots include increased precision and accuracy [45], [46], enhanced efficiency [45], minimized human error [45], remote surgery and telemedicine [45], etc.\nAutonomous Vehicles. Self-driving cars operate with varying degrees of delegated autonomy [47]. A vehicle's autonomous systems handle tasks like lane-keeping [48], [49] and adaptive steering control [50]\u2013[53], while the human driver remains responsible for monitoring the environment and taking control when needed [47]."}, {"title": "IV. KEY COMPONENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF HAT", "content": "Understanding the key components and characteristics of Human-Autonomy Teaming (HAT) is important for exploring its wide-ranging applications, as discussed in Section V.\nBased on [18], [27], [41], [54], [55], we identify the essential components and relevant aspects of integrating HAT in practical contexts. These components and aspects guide the understanding and implementation of human-autonomy interaction and teaming, thus providing suitable methodologies for conducting experiments [56].\nHuman Operators. The human component of HAT consists of competent skilled individuals with the necessary expertise, decision-making abilities, and interpersonal communication skills to achieve team goals [54]. Human workers engage in tasks requiring judgment, decision-making, creativity, and interpersonal communication [56].\nAI. In HAT, AI plays a crucial role in augmenting human abilities and driving team performance by providing cognitive capabilities, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making, which enable autonomous systems to operate effectively in complex environments [18]. Careful design and integration of AI algorithms are essential for the reliability, credibility, and transparency of HAT systems. For more details, refer to Section VIII.\nAutonomous Systems. This aspect of HAT involves machinery, computer systems, or AI that can automate tasks and make predictions through AI algorithms [27]. Autonomous systems enhance human abilities, enabling them to focus on complex tasks and decision-making.\nInterfacing with Autonomous Systems. Communication plays a vital role in HAT. An ontology-based communication language allows direct interactions between AI and autonomous systems. Effective communication in HAT is facilitated by a communication language ontology and domain ontologies [56]. These ontologies ensure seamless communication between humans, AI, and autonomous systems, thereby enhancing collaboration and data exchange [56].\nResearch on HAT underscores the importance of team performance outcomes, collaboration processes, and effective training methods [41], [57]."}, {"title": "V. APPLICATIONS OF HAT", "content": "After identifying the essential building blocks of HAT in the previous section, we explore how HAT applications are revolutionizing various industries. HAT technology has the potential to revolutionize many industries. HAT systems leverage the strengths of humans and autonomous systems to perform tasks with greater accuracy, speed, and reliability [58]. These systems are increasingly being employed across various industries to exploit the strengths of humans and intelligent autonomous systems. These teams can improve safety, efficiency, and productivity across various domains.\nDefense. In modern military applications, HAT systems enable the seamless integration of human intelligence and strategic thinking with the speed, precision, and endurance of intelligent autonomous systems [24], [59]. This integration enhances situational awareness, mission effectiveness, and operational efficiency [24], [59]. By combining the strengths of humans and intelligent machines, AI has the potential to revolutionize military operations and make the world a safer place.\nManufacturing. HAT can optimize industrial processes by combining human expertise with automation [19]. Humans have cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, and adaptability, and intelligent autonomous systems offer precision, strength, and speed [41].\nHealthcare. HAT systems have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by assisting medical professionals in their work [60]. Modern HAT systems can be used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, to identify signs of disease. HAT systems can also be used to analyze patient data, such as blood test results and medical history, to help physicians make more accurate diagnoses.\nGames. HAT principles can be applied to gaming to enhance player experiences by assisting with tasks that are difficult or time-consuming for humans, creating more engaging gameplay, and exploring new ways of interaction between players and autonomous systems in a virtual environment [20], [61].\nAviation and Space Exploration. HAT is a promising technology with the potential to revolutionize aviation and space exploration [54]. In aviation, cockpit automation involves collaboration between pilots and autonomous systems to safely operate aircraft [62], [63].\nTransportation. HAT can be applied to autonomous vehicles for passenger transportation and logistics. This involves collaboration between self-driving vehicles, human drivers, autonomous vehicles, and pedestrians in urban environments. In addition, HAT is considered essential for safe and efficient operation in the context of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. UAM is an emerging concept that refers to using aerial vehicles, such as drones or small electric aircraft, to transport people and goods within urban environments [64]. HAT can play a crucial role in ensuring safe, efficient, and integrated operations within UAM systems."}, {"title": "VI. THE ECONOMICS OF INTEGRATING AI AND HAT", "content": "Integrating AI and HAT for tactical autonomy brings about a range of economic benefits, particularly in domains where rapid and effective decision-making, enhanced situational awareness, and optimized resource utilization are critical. Although the potential of HAT applications across various industries is undeniable (Section V), a closer look at the economic impact of integrating AI and HAT is also important. This Section provides a detailed analysis of the potential economic benefits and challenges associated with such transformative collaboration. This study also examines the impact of AI-driven HAT on productivity, labor markets, cost-effectiveness, and overall economic growth. Additionally,"}, {"title": "A. Economic Benefits of Integrating AI and HAT", "content": "Several potential economic benefits of HAT are discussed in prior studies [65], [66]. These benefits include enhanced productivity, safety, operational efficiency, and cost reduction. HAT enables human workers to concentrate on creative and strategic tasks.\nImproved productivity. Effective collaboration between humans and autonomous systems can significantly improve productivity. Autonomous systems excel at performing repetitive tasks at high speed and accuracy, whereas humans contribute their expertise and decision-making skills, which are lacking in autonomous systems.\nReduced Operational Costs. Incorporating AI and HAT in tactical autonomy not only enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of critical missions but also contributes to substantial economic gains through reduced costs, increased success rates, and optimized resource utilization. Automation leads to cost reduction by delegating routine tasks, such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service, to autonomous systems. This, in turn, allows human workers to concentrate on more creative and strategic tasks that demand problem-solving skills and creativity. Hence, automating routine and data-intensive tasks through Al-powered autonomous systems reduces labor costs and minimizes human intervention. These optimizations translate to significant operational cost savings.\nImproved Situational Awareness. As explained below, AI enhances the information available to human operators, providing a comprehensive view of the tactical environment. This leads to better-informed decisions and minimizes the financial consequences of inadequate awareness.\nScalability and Flexibility. AI-driven intelligent autonomous systems can adapt to changing tactical conditions and complex requirements, enabling scalable operations without increasing human labor costs [19]."}, {"title": "B. Economic Challenges of Integrating AI and HAT", "content": "In addition to economic benefits, HAT presents potential economic challenges. One such challenge, for example, is job displacement because autonomous systems take over tasks currently performed by humans. In addition, increased reliance on autonomous systems can pose safety risks if they are not properly designed and operated. Here, we discuss some potential challenges in detail.\nJob displacement. Automation could lead to job displacement because modern and intelligent autonomous systems can take over tasks currently performed by humans. This shift might hurt the economy, resulting in higher unemployment rates and lower wages.\nIncreased safety risks. HAT could lead to increased safety risks if autonomous systems are not properly designed and operated. For example, mistakes made by autonomous systems can result in accidents or injury.\nPrivacy concerns. Automation could raise privacy concerns because autonomous systems can collect and store large amounts of data about human users. These data could be used for marketing or other purposes without the user's consent."}, {"title": "VII. SITUATION MODELS AND SHARED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN HAT", "content": "The economic analysis in Section VI highlighted the importance of efficient decision-making in HAT. However, effective decision-making requires a shared understanding of the situation. This section explores how situation models and shared situational awareness facilitate the flow of information required for human and autonomous systems to work together seamlessly."}, {"title": "A. Situation Models of HAT", "content": "In the context of HAT, situation models and shared situational awareness play a crucial role in ensuring effective collaboration between humans and autonomous systems in complex environments [67]. Situation models represent an individual's internal understanding of the world, their experiences, and others. This understanding is dynamic and constantly updated based on sensory inputs and mental models. For effective collaboration in complex environments, HAT requires humans, AI, and autonomous systems to develop internal situation models. Here, are the key aspects of the situation models in HAT.\nSituation. Similar to how humans in Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) rely on situational awareness, AI algorithms must develop and maintain an accurate model of the world. This is crucial for informed decision-making [67]\u2013[70]. Effective HAT systems emphasize shared mental models and team situational awareness. Advanced AI techniques can improve these aspects by providing humans with insights into the decision-making processes of machine learning models, further enhancing situational awareness and shared understanding [71].\nTask Environment. A dynamic function allocation mechanism has been proposed for future HAT systems, where tasks are distributed among human and autonomous teammates based on their capabilities [18]. This requires an updated model of the work environment, including current goals, assignments, plans, and the state of humans and automation involved [7].\nTeammate awareness. As humans must understand Al reliability, AI may require a model of the current state of its human teammates to perform assigned tasks effectively [72], [73].\nSelf-awareness. Being aware of one's capabilities is important. Team members who recognize fatigue, workload, or inadequate training can shift tasks to optimize performance [74], [75]. AI may need to develop a model of its performance limitations to indicate when human intervention is needed or whether its calculations are accurate [68], [76].\nThese individual situation models are important for achieving shared situational awareness, which is the focus of the following subsection."}, {"title": "B. Shared Situational Awareness", "content": "Situational awareness in HAT refers to individuals' and teams' ability to perceive, understand, and anticipate relevant information and events in their operational environment [77], [78]. This extends beyond human team members to include collaborative autonomous systems and robots. Developing shared situational awareness requires collaboration between humans, autonomous systems, and AI algorithms. Humans rely on sensory inputs such as vision and hearing, and autonomous systems rely on sensor data and AI algorithms for safety [77], [78]. Effective communication, information sharing, and collaboration are crucial for maintaining shared awareness over time in HAT. The following are some challenges to achieving shared situational awareness:\nInformation Overload. The vast amount of data generated by autonomous systems can overwhelm human agents [77], [79]. This makes it harder for users to concentrate on important tasks. HAT systems should provide mechanisms to filter and prioritize information, ensuring that human agents only receive relevant and actionable data [79].\nCognitive Overload. Processing large amounts of information while making decisions can lead to cognitive overload in human agents [77]. HAT systems can mitigate this by incorporating intelligent algorithms to facilitate data analysis and decision-making, which reduces the cognitive burden of humans.\nTraining and Interfaces. Effective use of tools and interfaces to facilitate shared situational awareness is crucial for human agents in HAT scenarios [80], [81]. These tools include dashboards, augmented reality displays, and communication systems that present relevant information. Training programs should cover not only technical aspects but also emphasize human-autonomy collaboration strategies and best practices. User-friendly interfaces and well-designed human-autonomy interaction mechanisms can also help reduce the learning curve and improve usability.\nIn summary, building a common operating picture through situation models and shared situational awareness is essential for effective HAT. By carefully managing information flow, providing appropriate training, and using well-designed interfaces, we can ensure successful collaboration between humans and autonomous systems."}, {"title": "VIII. ROLES OF AI IN HAT FOR TACTICAL OPERATIONS", "content": "Section VII highlighted the importance of shared understanding in HAT. However, effectively processing the enormous amount of information required by such models is a critical challenge. This section explores how Al capabilities are leveraged in HAT to address this challenge, with a specific focus on tactical operations.\nAI has created a revolutionary transformation in numerous domains and industries, introducing advanced capabilities previously beyond reach. In the medical and healthcare fields, for example, AI plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis, treatment development, and personalized patient care [82]. Diagnostic AI-powered systems exhibit remarkable accuracy in interpreting medical images, such as X-ray and MRI images, thereby helping medical professionals make more informed decisions. These systems excel at analyzing complex medical images and identifying tumors or anomalies that human professionals may overlook. Additionally, AI contributes to drug and therapy innovation, allowing personalized treatment plans for individual patients [82]. In the digital marketing context, AI is invaluable because it enhances the precision of targeted advertising, elevates customer experiences, and predicts consumer behavior [83], [84].\nIn the context of tactical autonomy, the potential roles of AI in HAT become even more critical. Tactical autonomy refers to the ability of autonomous systems to make decisions and take action in real-time, often in complex and unpredictable environments [12]. AI-powered systems can provide soldiers with real-time battlefield information and can also be used to develop autonomous weapons systems that can operate without human intervention [12]. The potential benefits of AI in tactical autonomy are significant. AI systems can help improve situational awareness, identify and track targets, plan and execute missions, communicate with other systems, and make decisions. This can lead to increased safety, efficiency, and effectiveness in military operations [24], [85].\nProvide situational awareness. As explained above, AI systems can collect, process, and analyze large amounts of data from sensors, cameras, and other sources to provide humans with an enhanced understanding of complex and dynamic environments [86]. It offers real-time insights, predictions, and suggestions that help human operators make informed decisions. This can help humans make better decisions and take appropriate actions.\nPlan and execute missions. Al systems can plan and execute missions considering various factors, such as the team environment, capabilities, and risks. This allows human operators to make high-level decisions and manage the overall mission.\nCommunicate with other systems. AI systems can communicate with other systems, such as other autonomous vehicles and command and control centers. This will help ensure that the team works effectively together.\nLearn and adapt. Al systems can learn from experience and adapt their behavior accordingly. This allows them to become more effective over time.\nMake decisions. Al systems can make decisions that are enhanced even in complex and uncertain situations. This can help humans avoid making mistakes and ensure that the team always acts in the best interests.\nHowever, some challenges must be addressed. One challenge is to ensure that AI systems are reliable and safe. Another challenge is the need to develop trust between humans"}, {"title": "IX. HUMAN-AI INTERACTION IN HAT FOR TACTICAL AUTONOMY", "content": "Effective human-AI interaction is crucial for successful HAT implementation. HAT systems are designed to allow human and autonomous systems to work together effectively in complex and dynamic environments. Section VIII explored how AI empowers HAT systems, particularly tactical operations. However, to harness the full potential of AI and collaborate effectively, well-designed user interfaces are essential. This section explores the key factors and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) design principles to consider when designing HAT interfaces, ultimately ensuring seamless human-machine collaboration. For example:\nTransparency and Explainability. These principles are fundamental to ensure that human operators can understand, trust, and effectively collaborate with autonomous systems [6], [87]. Transparency refers to the extent to which the human operator can understand how an autonomous system works and why it makes the decisions it does [6], [88]. In the context of HAT interfaces, transparency involves providing operators with insights into the functioning of an autonomous system and making decisions [71]. In contrast, explainability refers to the extent to which a human operator can understand the rationale behind an autonomous system's decisions [89], [90]. Achieving real-time transparency and explainability in HAT interfaces is important for human operators to rely on AI-driven recommendations and actions. However, achieving explainability and transparency in human-AI interaction within the context of tactical autonomy settings requires several advanced strategies and technologies [91].\nContext Awareness. HAT interfaces should provide human operators with the status of autonomous agents, the overall mission, and a clear and real-time understanding of the underlying tactical environment [92], [93]. Based on the current task and context, displaying relevant real-time information about the tactical environment, such as maps, sensor data, and mission objectives, is important to enhance human operators' situational awareness [94], [95].\nAdaptability and Flexibility. Tactical autonomy settings are often characterized by rapidly changing conditions. HAT systems are designed to operate in dynamic and unpredictable environments where the conditions can change rapidly. Therefore, the human-AI interaction mechanism must be able to adapt to these changes and be sufficiently flexible to accommodate various tasks, goals, and environments [96]. An adaptable HAI system can adjust its behavior, decision-making processes, and responses to accommodate these changes [97]. This allows the system to remain effective and relevant in a constantly evolving context.\nSafety and Redundancy. These aspects help improve the reliability, robustness, and trustworthiness of HAT systems in dynamic and potentially dangerous environments [98], [99]. Safety refers to measures and mechanisms implemented to prevent accidents, mitigate risks, and ensure that the system operates without harming humans, property, or the mission. Redundancy, on the other hand, involves duplicating critical components or functions within the HAT system to ensure that backups are available in case of failure [100]. The work in [101] provides an overview of the current state of safety solutions and challenges in ensuring the safety of autonomous systems.\nShared Mental Model. Developing shared mental models between humans and autonomous systems is important for effective collaboration and communication [102], [103]. A shared mental model refers to a common understanding of the task, environment, and capabilities of humans and autonomous systems [58], [104]. To promote the development of shared mental models and strengthen the collaboration between humans and autonomous systems, several critical strategies should be implemented [55]. First, clear communication is very important. This involves using a common language or terminology that is understandable to humans and autonomous systems. Second, feedback mechanisms play a significant role. Providing humans with feedback on the performance of autonomous systems enhances understanding and trust [55]. Third, visualization tools are also equally important. They help humans understand the internal states and reasoning processes"}, {"title": "X.

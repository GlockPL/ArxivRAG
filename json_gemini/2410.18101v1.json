In the small data regime, physics-based approaches model the interaction between the molecule being designed and proteins of key physiological functions, providing structural insights into the mechanism. When abundant data has been collected, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be more directly constructed from experimental data, from which machine learning can distill key insights to guide the design of the next round of experiment design. Machine learning methodologies can also facilitate physical modeling, from improving the accuracy of force fields and extending them to unseen chemical spaces, to more directly enhancing the sampling on the conformational spaces. We argue that these techniques are mature enough to be applied to not just extend the longevity of life, but the beauty it manifests. In this perspective, we review the current frontiers in the research & development of skin care products, as well as the statistical and physical toolbox applicable to addressing the challenges in this industry. Feasible interdisciplinary research projects are proposed to harness the power of machine learning tools to design innovative, effective, and inexpensive skin care products.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction: Beauty design and computer-aided molecular discovery.", "content": "The human race has been using cosmetics and skin-care products for more than 8000 years\u00b9-the history of which arguably predates that of medical practice. Through these 8 millenniums, while medical and medicinal sciences have been transformed into quantitative, mechanistic, rigorous, and digitalized disciplines, the design of cosmetics and skin-care products, referred to as beauty design henceforth, remains largely empirical, experimental, and trial-and-error-based.\nThe in silico approaches to design new molecule entities, namely therapeutics, using computer simulation and mod- eling are collectively termed computer-aided molecular dis- covery. Roughly, they can be characterize into two cate- gories, physics-inspired and data-driven, which correspond to ligand-based and structure-based drug discovery in medici- nal chemistry, respectively. The former models the conforma- tional landscape of a biomolecular system \u0393, which adopts a Boltzmann-type distribution:\n$p(x|\\Gamma) \\propto exp(-u(x; \\Gamma))$,\nbased on which ensemble properties of the system can be es- timated using the samples drawn from this distribution x\u1d62:\n$<O(x)> = \\int dx p(x|\\Gamma) O(x) = \\sum_{x_i} O(x_i)$.\nAnd molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be employed to generate such samples. If one only wishes to draw in- sights from the minima of Equation 1, they can further sim- plify Equation 2 to be:\n$O(x) \\approx O(argmax_{x_i} p(x_i|\\Gamma))$,\nwhere the optima are found by structural methods such as docking\u00b2 or protein folded pose prediction\u00b3,\u2074, although this can be a very crude approximation neglecting the dynamic nature of biomolecular systems.\nOn the other hand, data-driven methods seek insights di- rectly from data, most typically the molecule-measurement pairs. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models are constructed to model the mapping f : \u0393 \u2192 R from the molecular topological graphs \u0393 to scalar physical, chemi- cal, or physiological properties. This is where machine learn- ing has become an indispensable workhorse for designing new molecular entities\u2075\u207b\u2077. In principle, this school of molecular modeling characterizes the posterior predictive distribution\n$p(\\hat{y}_\\Gamma | \\Gamma, M) = \\int d\\Theta p(\\hat{y}_\\Gamma | \\Gamma, \\Theta, M)p(\\Theta | M, D)$,\nwhere the property of a molecule \u0393 given a model M can be written as that dependent upon the parameters to the model \u0398, marginalized across the parameter distribution conditioned on the existing data D = {\u0393\u1d62,y\u1d62}. This principled Bayesian approach is usually replaced with a single point maximum- likelihood estimate (MLE) on the parameter space.\nWhile traditional fingerprint-based methods are still used, small molecules are now more ubiquitously modeled as"}, {"title": "II. Objectives in skincare and cosmetics", "content": "In this section, we review the primary goals in beauty de- sign, the general taxonomy, and the physical laws to be con- sidered in each axis.\n### A. Coloration.\nCosmetic colorants can be classified into two major cate- gories based on their chemical composition: inorganic and organic colorants\u00b3\u00b3. The global annual production of inor- ganic colorants is approximately 10 million tons, accounting for 80% of the total colorant production\u00b3\u2074. Key inorganic col- orants include titanium dioxide, iron oxides, carbon black, zinc oxide, ultramarine pigments, and mica-based pearles- cent pigments, most of which are derived from natural min- erals\u00b3\u2075,\u00b3\u2076\u2014these pigments are widely used in facial, eye, lip, and nail products. Due to their stable crystalline structure, in- organic pigments exhibit high stability, excellent opacity from their high refractive index, and natural coloration\u00b3\u2077. Neverthe- less, they also have certain limitations, such as a narrow range of light absorption, making it difficult to cover a broader visi- ble spectrum, high surface energy leading to aggregation, and large particle size affecting skin permeability\u00b3\u2078.\nAs to organic colorants, they can be further divided into natural and synthetic colorants\u00b3\u2079. Natural colorants are typi- cally derived from plant and insect pigments, such as carmine, carotenoids, anthraquinones, betalains, and flavonoids. These colorants are popular among consumers due to their natural origin\u2074\u2070, although they also face challenges such as color in- stability and susceptibility to environmental degradation. In contrast, synthetic colorants generally offer excellent color stability, a wide range of spectral options, and superior light and heat resistance\u2074\u00b9. This is mainly due to their molecular structures, which often contain a large number of conjugated double bonds (e.g., azo and bonds, triphenylmethane struc- tures). These conjugated systems extend electron delocaliza- tion, enabling absorption over a broader wavelength range of visible light and producing vivid colors\u00b3\u2074. The highly con- jugated structures not only enhance molecular stability and reduce structural breakdown under light or heat exposure but also enable optimal electronic transitions, effectively absorb- ing specific wavelengths of light to improve color vibrancy and stability\u2074\u00b2. Synthetic colorants encompass a wide va- riety of types, including azo dyes, triphenylmethane dyes, flavonoid dyes, and anthraquinone dyes. Through optimized molecular design, these different types of dyes ensure color performance and stability across various application environ- ments. Moreover, the consistency achieved through batch syn- thesis results in highly uniform molecular structures and pu- rity, further enhancing the clarity and stability of the colors. However, due to environmental and health concerns, the de- sign of synthetic colorants requires more stringent molecular design criteria to minimize potential risks\u2074\u00b3.\n### B. Moisturization.\nThe moisturizing efficacy of skincare products is typically assessed through Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL), which measures the rate at which water diffuses from the stratum corneum into the atmosphere\u2074\u2074, where an evaporimeter is used to quantify the amount of water lost per square meter of skin surface per hour, providing insights into the skin's water ki- netics. Since TEWL primarily reflects the process of water diffusing from the deeper layers of the skin through the epi- dermis to the external environment, this process can be ap- proximately described by Fick's First Law of Diffusion\u2074\u2075:\n$J = -D\\frac{dC}{dx}$\nwhere J is the water flux D is the diffusion coefficient of water in the stratum corneum and dC/dx is the concentration gradi- ent of water.\nBased upon this relationship, different types of moisturiz- ing products regulate TEWL by adjusting the diffusion coef- ficient D or the concentration gradient dC/dx, thus achiev- ing a moisturizing effect. Typically, moisturizing ingredients in skincare products fall into one or more of the following three categories: humectants, occlusives, and emollients\u00b3\u2076.\nHumectants are generally compounds containing multiple hy- droxyl groups (-OH), such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, \u03b1 Hydroxy Acids, and propylene glycol. These molecules form stable hydrogen-bond networks with water, increasing the wa- ter content in the stratum corneum and lowering the chemical"}, {"title": "C. Skin Lightening", "content": "To achieve skin lightening typically requires interven- tion in the processes of melanin production, transport, and metabolism in the skin\u2074\u2077. Inhibiting melanin production is primarily achieved by targeting tyrosinase, a copper- containing metalloenzyme with two copper ions (CuA and CuB) in its active site, which are responsible for substrate binding and catalysis\u2074\u2078,\u2074\u2079. There are several strategies for inhibiting tyrosinase activity. The most direct approach in- volves inhibiting its active site. For example, arbutin effec- tively reduces tyrosinase activity through competitive inhibi- tion, thereby decreasing melanin production\u2075\u2070. Another ap- proach is to chelate the copper ions (CuA and CuB) at the active site, preventing the enzyme from functioning properly. Kojic acid, for instance, can form chelates with the copper ions in tyrosinase, significantly inhibiting its catalytic func- tion\u2074\u2079. Additionally, retinoic acid can suppress TYR gene promoter activity, reducing tyrosinase transcription and con- sequently lowering melanin synthesis at the source\u2075\u00b9. Ty- rosine activity is also influenced by glycosylation modifica- tions, and inhibitors like mannose can reduce tyrosinase gly- cosylation, thereby decreasing its enzymatic activity\u2075\u00b2. More- over, linoleic acid and \u03b2-sitosterol promote tyrosinase ubiqui- tination and proteasomal degradation, reducing the amount of active enzyme in the cell, and further inhibiting melanin pro- duction\u2075\u00b3,\u2075\u2074.\nBlocking melanin transport is also an essential strategy for achieving skin whitening. By interfering with the trans- fer of melanosomes from melanocytes to surrounding ker- atinocytes, the distribution of melanin in the epidermis can be reduced. Niacinamide, for example, can inhibit protease- activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) on keratinocytes, thereby reduc- ing melanosome transfer\u2074\u2077. Similarly, licorice extract inter- feres with the melanosome transport process by inhibiting sig- naling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, further reduc- ing melanin deposition in the epidermis\u2075\u2075."}, {"title": "D. Skin Penetration.", "content": "An important function in cosmetics is to activate collagen production and enhance antioxidant effects at the deeper lay- ers of the skin\u2075\u2076,\u2075\u2077. The skin serves as a protective barrier against external environmental factors. Therefore, for cos- metic molecules to be effective, they must penetrate this bar- rier to reach the underlying layers. Common skin-penetrating ingredients in cosmetic products can be broadly categorized into small molecules, peptides and liposomes.\nIn particular, small molecules in cosmetic products, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, salicylic acid, and niaci- namide, play crucial roles in processes such as amino acid hydroxylation in collagen, activation of signaling pathways, and antioxidation\u2075\u2078\u207b\u2076\u00b3. Due to their molecular weights rang- ing from 122 to 430, these small molecules can penetrate the deeper layers of the skin through aqueous channels or the lipid bilayer. Despite their favorable permeability, the rate of pen- etration is influenced by several factors, including formula-"}, {"title": "III. Frontiers in molecular discovery for beauty design", "content": "In \u00a7II, we have outlined the general guidelines of beauty design. In this section, we focus on two directions particu- larly popular in beauty design-collagen formation and mi- crohyaluronic acid application.\n### A. The odyssey towards collagen\nCollagen, the most common type of protein found in skin as well as tendons and bones, assists fibroblasts forming in the dermis, promoting the growth of new cells and replacing dead skin cells. Oral supplement of collagen has been linked to improved firmness, suppleness, moisture, smoothness, and elasticity of skin\u2079\u00b9\u207b\u2079\u00b3, although larger-scale study is needed to determine whether commercially available products are useful for long-term use. Used topically, certain mixtures of amino acids, such as arginine and ornithine, have been proven to pro- mote the disposition of collagen in wounds\u2079\u2074\u207b\u2079\u2076. Topically, the application of amino acids have also shown to be useful to boost collagen formation and skin moisture\u2079\u2077.\n### B. Micro hyaluronic acids: potency and risks\nMicro hyaluronic acids with low molecular weight are well known for their ability to penetrate the skin effectively. These tiny molecules can go through the skins' protective barrier and provide moisture directly to the deeper layers of the skin im- proving its elasticity and minimizing noticeable aging signs. This property is crucial in cosmetic dermatology, where hy- dration and skin suppleness are key to a youthful appearance. The effectiveness of micro hyaluronic acids in promoting skin hydration and reducing wrinkles has been substantiated"}, {"title": "IV. In silico beauty design: recent advances.", "content": "a. Efforts using machine learning to design peptides for skin care. Current trends in cosmetic molecule development closely align with those in medicinal chemistry\u00b9\u2070\u00b9,\u00b9\u2070\u00b2. In re- cent years, machine learning has played a significant role in peptide design and optimization, greatly improving the de- velopment efficiency of cosmetic peptides. Specifically, Yue et al. \u00b9\u2070\u00b3 reported using machine learning to predict the an- timicrobial activity and hemolytic properties of peptides, lead- ing to the design of a novel \u03b2-defensin-based antimicrobial peptide, IK-16-1.

The physical toolbox: molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.", "content": "Characterizing Equation 1 by drawing samples while inte- grating Newton's second motion of law, MD simulation finds use in all schools of molecular modeling. There have been a wide variety of mature and wide used pipelines for modeling the energy landscape of biomolecular systems of therapeutical interest, which can be seamlessly adopted to model those of cosmeceutical significance.\na. Modeling of cosmeceutical molecule-target binding. For beauty design, MD simulations\u00b2\u00b3,\u00b9\u00b9\u2074\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\u2076 can be em- ployed to model the interactions between the cosmeceutical molecules and their targets as well as provide detailed in- sights into the hydrogen bonding interactions that are critical for binding specificity and stability\u00b9\u00b9\u2077,\u00b9\u00b9\u2078. Quantitatively, the binding free energy between the small molecule and the tar- get protein can be reliably predicted\u00b9\u00b9\u2079. For crude predictions, popular methods include MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area) and MM-PBSA (Molecu- lar Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area)\u00b9\u00b2\u2070,\u00b9\u00b2\u00b9. Ala- nine scanning methods\u00b9\u00b2\u00b2,'\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3 can be used to further deduce the contribution of each residue towards the binding free en- ergy. More elaborately, free energy calculations based on ther- modynamic integration (TI)\u00b9\u00b2\u2074 and free energy perturbation (FEP)\u00b9\u00b2\u2075\u207b\u00b9\u00b2\u2077 have shown best correlation with experimental data, and therefore can be used to reliably predict the binding free energy between the small cosmeceutical molecule and the target.\nb. Physical property prediction Usually, Cosmetic com- pounds necessitate a thorough evaluation of ADMET profiles to guarantee their suitability for topical application\u00b9\u2070\u2079. This comprehensive assessment ensures that active ingredients are effectively absorbed through the skin barrier, distributed ap- propriately within the skin layers, metabolized without gen- erating harmful by-products, and excreted without accumu- lation that could lead to adverse effects. Traditionally, AD- MET evaluation has relied primarily on experimental meth- ods to determine these key pharmacokinetic and toxicologi- cal properties of drugs or active molecules. Recently, the ap- plication of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in ADMET prediction has emerged as a comple- mentary approach to experimental methods, offering advan- tages in terms of speed and accuracy\u00b9\u00b2\u2078\u207b\u00b9\u00b3\u2070. Besides, Physi- cal property prediction is required in the product's fluid prop- erties when applied to the skin. These properties include viscosity, rheological behavior, surface tension, diffusion co- efficients, and absorption kinetics\u00b9\u00b3\u00b9,\u00b9\u00b3\u00b2. These factors col- lectively determine a cosmetic product's ease of application,"}, {"title": "VI. The machine learning toolbox", "content": "a. Graph-based machine learning. Graph neural net- works\u2079\u207b\u00b9\u2074 have be come the de facto work horse of all schools of molecular modeling. A graph neural network can be most generally defined as one adopting a layer-wise updating scheme that aggregates representations from a node's neigh- borhood and updates its embedding:\n$\\Chi'_{v} = \\phi(\\Chi_{v}, \\rho(\\Chi_{u}, A_{uv}, u \\in \\mathcal{N}(v)))$,\nwhere \u03c6\u03c1 are the update and aggregate function, repsec- tively.

Roadmap: Potential use cases", "content": "Having reviewed the goals and challenges in the beauty de- sign industry and the powerful methodologies in our physi- cal and statistical toolboxes, in this section, we propose three projects that are immediately feasible, to showcase the poten- tial power of combining MD and ML approaches in beauty design.\na. The molecular modification of arbutin via multiobjec- tive active learning. Inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase, an essential enzyme for melanin synthesis in skin, arbutin has been ubiquitously used as skin-lightening agents targeting the hyperpigmentation issues. Usually extracted from the leaves of plants, such as the bearberry, the efficacy of this natu- ral product is bottlenecked by its inability to penetrate skin to reach the melanocytes\u00b9\u2075\u2074. We propose to develop arbutin derivatives displaying similar efficacy while showing signifi- cantly greater lipophilicity for better skin penetration.\nFirst, docking and molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to better understand the binding mechanism of ar- butin. With these structural insights, we will carry out molecu- lar modification, for example using fragment-based tools such as Zhang et al. \u00b9\u2075\u2075, to replace functional groups on arbutin. This can be done in an ultra-high throughput manner, generat- ing a large library of arbutin-derivatives. Multitask Bayesian optimization algorithms can then design experiments to be carried out sequentially, to optimize for both lipophilicity and melanocytes-inhibiting activity, which can be accessed either experimentally or using free energy calculations.\nb. Optimizing the ADMET profile of hyluronic acid. The extremely small molecular weight of hyluronic acid is both a blessing and a curse-it enables the easy penetration of the skin while also triggers inflammatory reactions. The chem- ical modification of hyluronic acid\u00b9\u2075\u2076 has been proven to be an effective avenue towards efficient drug delivery. Using the modification strategies outlined in Bokatyi, Dubashynskaya, and Skorik \u00b9\u2075\u2076, we can chemically decorate the backbone with inactive functional groups to moderately increase the molec- ular weight of hyluronic acid, while not altering its ability to hold water. These modifications can be propsoed either by generative models or fragment-based structure enumeration"}, {"title": "VIII. Conclusions", "content": "From this perspective, we discuss the contributions of computational tools, including molecular dynamics and ma- chine learning, to the discovery and development of cosmetic molecules.

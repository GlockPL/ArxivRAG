{"title": "MIRRORSTORIES: Reflecting Diversity through Personalized Narrative Generation with Large Language Models", "authors": ["Sarfaroz Yunusov", "Hamza Sidat", "Ali Emami"], "abstract": "This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating personalized \"mirror stories\" that reflect and resonate with individual readers' identities, addressing the significant lack of diversity in literature. We present MIRRORSTORIES, a corpus of 1,500 personalized short stories generated by integrating elements such as name, gender, age, ethnicity, reader interest, and story moral. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively incorporate diverse identity elements into narratives, with human evaluators identifying personalized elements in the stories with high accuracy. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving 26 diverse human judges, we compare the effectiveness of MIRRORSTORIES against generic narratives. We find that personalized LLM-generated stories not only outscore generic human-written and LLM-generated ones across all metrics of engagement (with average ratings of 4.22 versus 3.37 on a 5-point scale), but also achieve higher textual diversity while preserving the intended moral. We also provide analyses that include bias assessments and a study on the potential for integrating images into personalized stories.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "\n\"There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\u201d \u2014 Maya Angelou\nMirror books are stories that reflect the reader's identity, culture, and experiences, serving to engage, validate, and empower individuals. Such books are crucial in educational settings, fostering a sense of belonging and self-understanding through diverse narratives, while also improving engagement and comprehension. Beyond education, personalized narratives have shown potential in various fields, including health communication and marketing, where they enhance patient understanding and adherence, and strengthen emotional connections between brands and consumers. Despite the profound need for these personalized narratives, there is a noticeable underrepresentation of non-white minority groups in literature relative to their population size, detailed in Appendix Figure 6. The gap in cultural representation highlights the need for more inclusive narratives that reflect diverse reader identities, enhance empathy, and promote cultural awareness . Diversity in literature can lead to improved innovation and a broader consideration of ideas, ultimately enriching the reading experience for all. Advancements in natural language processing, particularly through the development of LLMs like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA have introduced the potential to address these gaps on a large scale. LLMs excel in generating human-like text and adapting content to various contextual needs. Recent studies have investigated LLMs' capabilities in expressing personality within generated content and developing methods to induce and edit personality expressions in LLM outputs. New benchmarks have also been released to assess personality traits in LLM outputs. However, there remains a gap in research concerning whether LLMs can generate content that incorporates identity traits and faithfully mirrors the diverse identities of a global readership.\nOur study addresses this gap by exploring the potential of LLMs to create mirror stories-narratives that genuinely reflect and resonate with the identities of individual readers. We present a framework"}, {"title": "MIRRORSTORIES", "content": "MIRRORSTORIES is a corpus designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate both generic and personalized short narratives based on predefined morals and identity elements. Each dataset instance consists of a moral (e.g., \u201cKindness is never wasted\") guiding the narrative's tone and a set of identity elements (name, age, gender, ethnicity, and personal interest) to personalize the story. Specifically, the dataset includes a human-written and an LLM-generated generic story, both of which do not incorporate specific identity elements, and an LLM-generated personalized story that includes these elements to enhance relevance and engagement. Appendix A.5 provides a detailed example of the dataset structure."}, {"title": "Dataset Collection", "content": "MIRRORSTORIES incorporates human-written stories derived from Aesop's fables, a well-known collection famous for its clear narrative structure and explicit moral conclusions. The morals serve as guides for generating both generic and personalized stories. The complete list of morals is provided in Appendix A.5 Table 7.\nIdentities Identity traits such as name, age, gender, ethnic background, and interests are included to personalize the narratives. We drew from 123 unique ethnic backgrounds, 124 diverse interests, and 28 distinct morals. The complete set of identities is provided in Appendix A.5 Table 7.\nGeneric & Personalized LLM-Generated Stories Generic stories are generated focusing solely"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "We conducted two experiments to assess the effectiveness of personalization in LLM-generated stories: Personalization Validation, which validates the integration of identity elements within the narratives, and Personalization Impact, which assesses the impact of these narratives on user engagement, comprehension, satisfaction, and personalness.\nPrompts In both experiments, personalized prompts incorporating identity elements were used to generate personalized stories. For Personalization Validation, these elements were specifically asked not to be stated explicitly, to test their seamless integration into the narrative. In the Personalization Impact experiment, personal elements were aligned with those of 26 human evaluators, ensuring that each story was tailored to evaluators. Figure 1 and 2 provide detailed structures of the prompts for both generation and evaluation.\nHuman Evaluation In both experiments, the same 26 human evaluators-all students from diverse disciplines\u2014were tasked with evaluating the narratives (for demographic details, see Appendix Figure 8). For the Personalization Validation, they answered a structured questionnaire for a random sample of 30 stories to identify the personalized"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Are MIRRORSTORIES personalized? The effectiveness of personalization in MIRRORSTORIES is evident from the high accuracy rates in identifying identity elements by both human and LLM evaluators. As shown in Figure 3, human evaluators were particularly adept at identifying gender and ethnicity with accuracies at 100% and 94%, respectively. Similarly, GPT-4 showed robust performance, matching or exceeding human accuracy in all categories, which confirms the high level of personalization achieved in the narratives.\nPersonalized LLM-generated stories also effectively incorporate both the provided moral and the reader's interests, with a stronger emphasis on the moral. To demonstrate this, we used BERTopic for topic modeling to identify the top five terms for each story. We then"}, {"title": "How does personalization affect moral comprehension?", "content": "We analyzed the impact of personalization on moral comprehension in stories. Evaluators were asked to identify the main message of each type of story, or provide \u2018N/A' if they could not. We manually assessed the evaluators' responses to the intended morals. Excluding 'N/A' responses, the correctly identified morals are detailed in Table 1. The results indicate that differences in moral identification across story types are not statistically significant, demonstrating that adding personalization did not negatively affect the model's ability to convey the intended moral. A sample of evaluator responses is shown in Appendix Figure 3."}, {"title": "What is the impact of personalization on textual diversity?", "content": "We analyzed how personalization elements impact textual diversity using the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI). Table 2 shows that personalized stories achieve the highest SDI among all story types. Including a single personalization element, such as the 'interest' element, also increases SDI compared to generic and human-written stories with the same moral. Additionally, we observed that increasing GPT-4's temperature negatively affects the diversity and coherence of generic LLM-generated stories. At a temperature of 1.2, the stories showed increased diversity but began to lose coherence. Further increasing the temperature to 1.5 resulted in nonsensical outputs."}, {"title": "Extended Analyses", "content": "We examine cases where human and LLM evaluators either contradict or agree on the scores assigned to stories, providing insights into the differences in evaluations and preferences for various types of stories. Examples of these cases, highlighting instances of both agreement and disagreement between human and LLM evaluators, are presented in Appendix Figure 15.\nImage generation for personalized stories We explored the potential of incorporating images into stories to enhance engagement and representation. The image generation and evaluation processes are detailed in Appendix Table 18. Notably, human evaluators show a high accuracy in identifying personalized elements in the images generated by DALL\u00b7E 2 with gender and interest being recognized with 100% and 95% accuracy, respectively (Appendix Figure 17)."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "To maintain consistency and feasibility within the scope of our study, we imposed certain constraints on the stories generated, such as limiting the length to 250-300 words and focusing on a specific set of morals. While these constraints allowed for a controlled comparison between personalized and generic stories, they may not fully capture the potential of LLMs in generating longer, more complex narratives or exploring a wider range of themes and morals. Future research could investigate the impact of personalization on stories of varying lengths and themes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how these factors influence reader engagement and satisfaction.\nWhile our study aimed to include a diverse range of identities and backgrounds, the demographic diversity of our human evaluators was by no means the perfect sample of global readership. The majority of our evaluators were university students, which may not be representative of the broader population. Future research should include a more diverse pool of evaluators across age, education, and cultural backgrounds to ensure the generalizability of the findings and to capture a wider range of perspectives on personalized storytelling.\nOur study primarily examined personalization factors like age, gender, interests, and ethnic background. However, aspects such as personality traits, emotional resonance, and narrative preferences were not extensively investigated but could notably enhance engagement and narrative impact. For example, aligning story elements with reader emotional responses or tailoring narratives to specific preferences like mystery, romance, or adventure could significantly boost satisfaction and engagement.\nAnother limitation of our study is the inherent subjectivity involved in evaluating the impact of personalized stories. Despite our attempts to standardize evaluation criteria and maintain consistency among evaluators, individual preferences, biases, and interpretations can still significantly influence the outcomes. This subjectivity can lead to variability in how different evaluators perceive and rate the same narrative elements.\nOur study utilized GPT-4, Claude3, Gemini-1.5, and DALL-E 2 for generating and evaluating narratives and images. This limited selection may affect the generalizability of our findings, as different models might produce or assess stories differently based on their training data and algorithms. Expanding future research to include a variety of models, including open-source ones, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of how different language models handle personalization in storytelling and evaluate narrative elements."}, {"title": "Ethical Considerations", "content": "We followed strict ethical standards throughout our research to ensure validity and fairness. Consent and transparency were central to our approach, with all participants fully informed and providing explicit consent. We also ensured compliance with intellectual property rights by using Aesop's fables, which are in the public domain.\nEnsuring the privacy and security of participants' personal information was a top priority. We collected and used personal details such as age, gender, interests, and ethnic background to generate personalized stories. Robust data protection measures were implemented, including secure storage, anonymization, and restricted access to sensitive information. Participants were informed about how their data would be used, stored, and protected.\nWhile personalized storytelling has the potential to enhance engagement and representation, we carefully considered the potential for misuse or unintended consequences. To mitigate risks such as the manipulation of individuals' emotions or the reinforcement of stereotypes, we implemented safeguards against harmful content and regularly audited the generated stories for potential biases or inappropriate themes.\nWhen generating personalized stories, we strived to ensure that the stories were inclusive and representative of diverse identities and experiences. This included considering factors such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and socioeconomic status. We aimed to create stories that were respectful, authentic, and empowering for all individuals, avoiding stereotypes and promoting positive representation.\nAccountability and integrity were paramount in"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Our study builds on research on the effectiveness of personalized narratives in engaging readers and improving learning outcomes. We extend this work by examining how LLMs can generate personalized narratives to increase reader engagement and satisfaction. While promising, the accuracy of personal traits in generated content remains challenging, with studies showing mixed results . Concurrently, LLM exploration in narrative generation has focused on improving coherence and depth. To assess these advancements, recent evaluative techniques for narrative systems emphasize user interactions and alignment metrics between visual content and narratives."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in generating personalized narratives that effectively incorporate diverse identity elements and enhance reader engagement compared to generic stories. MIRRORSTORIES consists of 1,500 personalized stories that consistently outperform generic ones on key metrics. By making MIRRORSTORIES publicly available and integrating it into an interactive web application, we aim to encourage further research on personalized narrative generation, contributing to more engaging and inclusive content.

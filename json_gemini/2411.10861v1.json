However, its application to large-scale projects remains limited by several critical challenges. One of the foremost issues is the token limitation of large language models (LLMs). These models can only process a limited number of tokens at a time, making it infeasible to generate or validate entire codebases with hundreds of files simultaneously.\nBeyond token limitations, the process of generating multiple interdependent files introduces significant complexity. Current generative approaches often treat each file in isolation, lacking awareness of the broader project structure. This locality of generation results in misaligned or incompatible dependencies, leading to inefficient development cycles and the need for extensive manual corrections.\nFurthermore, the iterative refinement of generated code exacerbates these inefficiencies. Repeatedly revisiting and updating both main and dependency files to resolve inconsistencies increases computational costs and delays project completion.\nThese challenges are addressed through the methodology proposed in this paper that not only addresses token and dependency limitations but also ensures coherent and efficient code generation at scale."}, {"title": "2 Framework", "content": "The See-Saw mechanism is a recursive and adaptive framework designed to construct scalable and coherent codebases by dynamically managing the interplay between main code and its dependencies.

It provides simple CRUD operations\u00b9, static user authentication, and straightforward API integrations, which are easier to set up and understand for smaller teams or less complex projects. However, its reliance on session-based authentication and lack of modularity restrict its scalability. This limitation becomes more apparent as the project grows in complexity, requiring additional effort to refactor or enhance the system for new features. Moreover, the Standard method"}, {"title": null, "content": "typically omits comprehensive testing, relying mainly on basic test cases that may not sufficiently address edge cases or integration scenarios. While this simplicity facilitates rapid prototyping and early-stage development, it introduces risks in production environments, particularly in scenarios requiring robust error handling and security.\nIn contrast, the See-Saw mechanism demonstrates clear improvements in terms of modularity, scalability, and security. The adoption of JWT-based stateless authentication\u00b2 ensures that user sessions are efficiently managed across distributed environments, while hashed passwords offer enhanced protection against credential theft. These features make See-Saw particularly suitable for applications requiring high scalability and robust security measures. See-Saw's modular architecture streamlines the integration of additional components and simplifies maintenance by separating concerns. This design choice supports iterative refinement and dependency alignment, enabling long-term scalability and flexibility. Its expanded testing framework covers both unit and integration levels, with dynamic UI interactions and edge-case validations ensuring reliability under diverse conditions.\nHowever, the See-Saw method's advantages come at the cost of increased setup complexity. When implementing multi-file projects, the See-Saw mechanism prevents dependency mismatches that can arise in the Standard approach. The Standard model requires developers to manually review and align dependencies in all files, consuming significant human resources to refactor and ensure the project functions cohesively. By contrast, the See-Saw method aligns dependencies iteratively, reducing the need for human intervention and ensuring a more robust, consistent project structure. This alignment minimizes the risk of inadvertently duplicating or omitting dependencies, an issue more prevalent in the Standard model.\nWhen considering both methods for larger projects, the See-Saw mechanism provides a richer, more structured codebase. Its alignment with the main repository and consistent dependency management significantly reduces the manual effort required to refactor and synchronize components across the project. The Standard method, in contrast, often requires substantial human effort to manually align all components when dependencies evolve or new features are added. For small projects, the Standard method remains a viable choice due to its reduced complexity and ease of use. However, for projects with higher dependencies and scalability requirements, the See-Saw model provides a better starting template.

One key challenge is to rely on a complete and accurate project tree during the initial stage. The mechanism requires robust tree generation capabilities, including automated tree creation to account for missing components and removal of deprecated versions. This limitation underscores the need for more advanced tree management algorithms to ensure consistency and efficiency. Initially in this project, the tree was generated from the LLM. Another challenge lies in the computational overhead associated with scaling the mechanism to very large projects. Although execution time remains competitive, the use of optimization techniques such as parallelism could mitigate potential performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, the current implementation is tailored to software engineering projects, leaving its applicability to other domains, such as hardware design or knowledge graph generation, relatively unexplored. Finally, expanding its generalization across diverse fields could significantly broaden its utility.\nFuture research could explore hybrid models combining the efficiency of the Standard Approach for simple iterations with the adaptive refinement of the See-Saw mechanism for critical dependencies. These challenges can be treated by integrating reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust generation and alignment processes, potentially improving efficiency and scalability. Predictive models for resource allocation could further enhance performance, ensuring scalability and efficiency in diverse applications.\nAdditionally, exploring the application of the See-Saw mechanism to multi-modal generative tasks involving both code and documentation could pave the way for new and innovative use cases."}, {"title": "7.3 Final Remarks", "content": "This system offers an interesting approach to scalable and dynamic code generation, addressing long-standing challenges in software engineering.

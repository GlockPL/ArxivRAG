While such models hold great promise for robotics, the prevailing paradigm still portrays robots as single, autonomous decision-makers, performing tasks like manipulation and navigation, with limited human involvement. However, a large class of real-world robotic systems, including wearable robotics (e.g., prostheses, orthoses, exoskeletons), teleoperation, and neural interfaces, are semiau-tonomous, and require ongoing interactive coordination with human partners, challenging single-agent assumptions. In this position paper, we argue that robot foundation models must evolve to an interactive multi-agent perspective in order to handle the complexities of real-time human-robot co-adaptation. We propose a generaliz-able, neuroscience-inspired architecture encompassing four modules: (1) a multimodal sensing module informed by sensorimotor integration principles, (2) an ad-hoc teamwork model reminiscent of joint-action frameworks in cognitive science, (3) a predictive world belief model grounded in internal model theories of motor control, and (4) a memory/feedback mechanism that echoes concepts of Hebbian and reinforcement-based plasticity. Although illustrated through the lens of cyborg systems, where wearable devices and human physiology are in-separably intertwined, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to robots operating in semi-autonomous or interactive contexts. By moving beyond single-agent designs, our position emphasizes how foundation models in robotics can achieve a more robust, personalized, and anticipatory level of performance.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Over the past few years, the field of AI has been profoundly influenced by foundation models, which are large, high-capacity neural networks pre-trained on extensive and heterogeneous datasets (Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023). These models, exemplified by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, and large multimodal models (LMMs) like PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023), offer a flexible interface for perception, reasoning, and action. In robotics, foundation models have been applied to unify diverse tasks, e.g., manipulation, navigation, or object recognition, under a single policy (Reed et al., 2022; Brohan et al., 2022), often operating in a single-agent paradigm where the robot acts autonomously, under minimal human involvement.\nHowever, a large class of real-world robotics, particularly those involving continuous human collaboration, are inherently multi-agent. Applications such as teleoperation (Lichiardopol, 2007; Okamura, 2004; Kofman et al., 2005), prosthetic devices (Best et al., 2023; Cimolato et al., 2022; Quintero et al., 2017; Wen et al., 2019; Dey et al., 2020; Dey & Schilling, 2022), exoskeletons (Molteni et al., 2018; Rosen & Perry, 2007; Lo & Xie, 2012; Dey et al., 2023), neural interfaces (Jackson & Zimmermann, 2012; Donoghue, 2008; Schultz & Kuiken, 2011; Vogel et al., 2020), brain-computer interfaces (Wolpaw, 2013; Nicolas-Alonso & Gomez-Gil, 2012; McFarland & Wolpaw, 2017; Abiri et al., 2019), and other semi-autonomous systems (Suchan & Osterloh, 2023; Clark & Feng, 2015) require ongoing co-adaptation with humans or other participating agents in the environment, rather than isolated, one-shot instructions. In these contexts, the single-agent perspective encounters significant limitations: it struggles to interpret dynamic and evolving user states and fails to handle non-stationary factors such as shifting goals, user fatigue, and changing environmental conditions.\nHuman-interactive robotics and cyborgs, in particular, demand continuous, bidirectional feedback loops between the human user and the device. At each step, the device must integrate physiological signals (e.g., electromyography, joint kinematics), user preferences, and environmental cues to ensure safe and comfortable completion of user commands. Over time, both the human and the device need to learn to function as a coordinated pair. This complexity aligns more closely with"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), BLIP (Li et al., 2022), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023) has sig-nificantly advanced robotics by enhancing perception, planning, and action generation capabilities. These models demonstrate exceptional abilities in understanding and generating multimodal data, which are crucial for complex robotic tasks (Driess et al., 2023; Brohan et al., 2022; Team et al., 2024). By leveraging the robust linguistic capabilities of LLMs, robots can interpret and execute tasks based on natural language commands, eliminating the need for complex programming inter-faces. For instance, robots can parse instructions such as \"Bring the red cup from the kitchen table\" into structured subtasks involving object identification, navigation, and manipulation (Brown et al., 2020).\nDespite the impressive capabilities of modern robot foundation models, such as Gato (Reed et al., 2022) and RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022), their predominantly single-agent framework can limit performance in scenarios requiring tight coor-dination with humans or other agents. These models typically learn policies under the assumption that the robot operates largely on its own, taking in sensory inputs and issuing motor commands without ongoing, interactive feedback from a collaborator or user. Although they have achieved notable results on tasks like manipulation, navigation, and even some language grounding, key shortcomings emerge when real-time collaboration or continuous human guidance is essential."}, {"title": "2.1.1. LIMITATIONS OF SINGLE-AGENT FOUNDATION MODELS IN ROBOTICS", "content": "1) Inability to Handle Mid-Task User Corrections. Gato (Reed et al., 2022), for example, was demonstrated on multi-ple discrete and continuous control tasks, ranging from Atari gameplay to real-world robotic arm manipulation. However, it was not designed to handle situations where a human might intervene mid-task with corrective feedback or dynamically changing instructions (e.g., \"Wait, do not place the block there, hand it to me instead.\"). As a single-agent learner, Gato follows its end-to-end policy after receiving an initial goal or observation. If the human's intent shifts during task execution, Gato cannot seamlessly incorporate that feedback without externally resetting or retraining the policy. A multi-agent perspective, by contrast, would treat the user as a parallel decision-maker; the system would maintain a belief state about the user's evolving instructions, thus adapting plans in real time rather than requiring full restarts.\n2) Lack of Human-Robot \"Turn-Taking\" in RT-1.

The primary distinction between MAS and single-agent systems lies in the ability to manage interdependencies and leverage collective intelligence to solve problems that are intractable for individual agents."}, {"title": "2.2.2. AD-HOC TEAMWORK", "content": "Building upon the foundation of MAS, ad-hoc teamwork (Rahman et al., 2021; Barrett, 2015; Rahman et al., 2021; Melo & Sardinha, 2016) enhances the ability of agents to collaborate effectively without prior coordination, control, or extensive communication.

PRINCIPLES OF AD-HOC TEAMWORK", "content": "Flexibility and Adaptation: Agents must adapt to varying team compositions and roles, accommodating new members or the departure of existing ones without significant performance degradation (Rahman et al., 2021).\nImplicit Communication: Effective ad-hoc teamwork can rely on indirect cues and shared environmental information rather than explicit instructions, enabling seamless collaboration with minimal communication overhead (Barrett, 2015).\nShared Goals and Intentions: Successful ad-hoc teams align their individual objectives with collective goals, ensuring that all agents work towards a common purpose despite originating from different starting points (Barrett, 2015)."}, {"title": "2.2.4. ADVANTAGES OF AD-HOC TEAMWORK OVER SINGLE-AGENT SYSTEMS", "content": "Dynamic Adaptation to Human Partners: In human-robot interactions, ad-hoc teamwork enables robots to adjust their behavior based on real-time human actions and intentions (Rahman et al., 2021). This adaptability is essential for assistive devices and cyborg systems, where user needs can change rapidly (Mirsky et al., 2022).\nEnhanced Collaboration in Unstructured Environments: Robots operating in unpredictable settings (e.g., disaster zones or dynamic factory floors) benefit from the ability to form spontaneous coalitions and coordinate responses to new challenges (Barrett et al., 2017).\nImproved User Experience: By enabling more natural and intuitive interactions, often relying on implicit communication, ad-hoc teamwork boosts user satisfaction and trust. Robots are perceived as more reliable and competent partners when they fluidly adapt to human cues.\nAdaptive Learning and Co-Evolution: Agents in multi-agent systems learn from and adapt to one another over time. In human-in-the-loop settings, this means the robot and user can co-evolve, preventing the rigid, static policies typical of single-agent models.\nResilience to Change: Decentralized or distributed control in multi-agent systems fosters robustness against environmental shifts or new team compositions. When one agent fails or a new user goal emerges, the team can reconfigure itself and maintain overall performance.\nFacilitating Human-Robot Synergy: By explicitly modeling the human's actions, internal states, and likely next steps, multi-agent systems allow for smoother joint actions, reducing collisions, user discomfort, or misunderstandings about shared goals (Barrett et al., 2017).\nBy integrating multi-agent and ad-hoc teamwork capabilities, robotic foundation models can achieve a higher level of inter-action and collaboration, addressing the fundamental shortcomings of single-agent models. This collaborative framework is essential for developing robots that can engage in real-time, adaptive interactions with humans and other agents, thereby enhancing their functionality and applicability in complex, dynamic environments."}, {"title": "3. The Human-Device Dyad and Cyborg Systems", "content": "A defining feature of human-interactive robots or cyborg systems (i.e., wearable robotics, including prostheses and ex-oskeletons) is the fusion of human physiology with artificial actuation. In these scenarios, the user (with biological muscles, joints, and neural control) and the robotic device (with actuators, sensors, and algorithms) act as two tightly coupled agents. This bi-directional relationship resonates with sensorimotor loops in neuroscience, where the brain sends motor commands to the musculoskeletal system and receives multisensory feedback to update its internal state (Wolpert & Kawato, 1998).\nA single-agent perspective would treat high-level user commands as isolated or sporadic inputs, thereby neglecting the continuous interplay between user and device. This oversight can lead to abrupt control actions, delayed task transitions, or non-personalized responses, especially when the user's biomechanical or cognitive state changes unexpectedly. Treating the human and the device as two agents with partially observable, evolving states opens the door to ad-hoc collaboration paradigms, wherein:\nThe device infers the user's intentions and biomechanical constraints from subtle signals like muscle activation pat-terns.\nThe user, in turn, adjusts their motor strategies based on feedback from the device's behavior.\nThe device maintains and updates an internal model of the user dynamically, for more synergistic control.\nEven in ostensibly \u201cautonomous\" robot applications, there can be hidden interaction partners, such as a human operator providing commands, or an environment whose states change in response to the robot's actions. Integrating multi-agent interactions into foundation models equips robots with explicit representations of user states, fostering the ability to predict and adapt continuously based on teammates' models of the world. This integration addresses the fundamental limitations of single-agent, autonomous controllers in human-interactive settings."}, {"title": "3.1. Alternative to Modern AI-Based Approaches: Finite-State Machines (FSMs)", "content": "Contrasting with modern AI-based controllers, many existing cyborg-like devices utilize finite-state machines (FSMs) to de-termine high-level behaviors such as standing, walking, or ascending stairs based on simple sensor thresholds (Tucker et al., 2015). While FSMs offer straightforward implementation and higher interpretability, they suffer from inherent limitations:\nReactive Design: Transitions typically occur only after sensor thresholds are crossed, leading to potential lag or misclassification when dealing with rapid or subtle user motion changes.\nLack of Predictive Modeling: FSMs generally do not maintain forward-looking estimates of user dynamics or inten-tions (e.g., anticipating a user's transition from walking to running before sensor data fully reflects this change), nor do they store long-term user preferences.\nMinimal Personalization: Generic thresholds are usually uniform across all users or only slightly tuned, missing opportunities to develop personalized, long-term models of each user's comfort and biomechanical idiosyncrasies.\nShortfall: These limitations overlook fundamental insights from neuroscience, such as the role of predictive and adaptive control in biological motor systems. For example, the concept of efference copy suggests that the central nervous system forwards internal predictions of movement outcomes to anticipate sensory feedback and modulate subsequent actions (Kawato, 1999). Similarly, single-agent foundation models lack deeper modeling of user trajectories and internal states, resulting in less fluid and adaptive interactions compared to multi-agent models that incorporate predictive and adaptive control mechanisms."}, {"title": "3.2. Non-Adaptive User Integration in Single-Agent Models", "content": "Single-agent models often process user inputs as external, episodic commands without maintaining a structured, continu-ously updated model of the user. This one-directional handling prompts policy decisions without an evolving teammate model, which is particularly problematic in wearable robotics where the user's physiological and behavioral states are dynamic and critically impact device control. Specifically, single-agent, non-adaptive integration falls short in:\nTracking User State Trajectories: Without an explicit internal model of the user's evolving comfort level, fatigue, or motion intent, the device cannot proactively adjust its outputs in response to changes in the user's gait or stance, potentially leading to overshooting or misalignment of forces.\nAnticipating Transitions: If the device treats user commands as static triggers rather than dynamic signals, it may lag behind sudden shifts in user intent, resulting in suboptimal or unsafe responses (e.g., delayed torque adjustments when transitioning to an incline for a prosthesis).\nCapitalizing on Repeated Interactions: The absence of memory regarding user-specific preferences or long-term progression hinders the ability to personalize interactions and improve user experience over time.\nIn essence, single-agent systems rarely treat the user as a co-evolving entity with its own sensorimotor goals. Wearable prosthetics and exoskeletons demand tightly coupled, bidirectional information flow, aligning more closely with a multi-agent perspective that includes explicit or learned models of human states and intentions (Rahman et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Mirsky et al., 2022). This paradigm shift is especially critical in safety-critical or high-comfort applications, where even minor latency or mismatches in human-device coordination can lead to falls, fatigue, or user frustration."}, {"title": "4. Position: Embracing an Interactive Multi-Agent Foundational Architecture Inspired by Neuroscience", "content": "We position that future robot foundation models must adopt an interactive multi-agent framework, especially for human-in-the-loop or semi-autonomous domains, one that recognizes the user and the robot (e.g., a cyborg prosthetic device) as two interacting agents. We suggest that advanced language or multimodal models should serve not simply as \"language-to-action\" converters as in current robot foundation models, but as one component (a sensing module) within a larger, hierarchical architecture. To concretize this vision, we propose a four-module, neuroscience-inspired approach:\nA sensing module that integrates language and multimodal inputs (e.g., EMG, camera data) into structured proposals, mirroring how biological systems merge sensory feedback with high-level goals (Pulverm\u00fcller, 2005).\nAn ad-hoc teamwork model (Rahman et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Mirsky et al., 2022) that applies multi-agent collaboration principles, aligning with joint-action and shared intentionality theories in cognitive science (Tomasello & Rakoczy, 2003; Sebanz et al., 2006).\nA predictive world belief model that maintains an internal model of the user and/or collaborating agents' states, enabling anticipatory actions, inspired by motor control theories on forward internal models and predictive cod-ing (Wolpert et al., 1995; Wolpert, 1997; Wolpert & Kawato, 1998; Rao & Ballard, 1999; Millidge et al., 2021; Denham & Winkler, 2020).\nA memory/feedback subsystem that stores user-specific preferences and updates policies in a reinforcement-like man-ner, akin to the role of synaptic plasticity and reinforcement learning in shaping long-term sensorimotor adaptations (Dayan & Abbott, 2005)"}, {"title": "4.1. Module 1: Sensing via Language and Multimodal Inputs", "content": "Neuroscientific Parallels. Biological organisms integrate sensory cues from diverse modalities (visual, auditory, propri-oceptive) to build coherent percepts and guide behavior (Stein, 1993). Similarly, language in humans is thought to interact with high-level planning networks in the brain, providing semantic context and task-relevant goals (Pulverm\u00fcller, 2005).\nDesign Concept. Our Sensing Module leverages language models (e.g., LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)) and multimodal models (e.g., PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023)) to parse:\nUser Commands: Natural language instructions, which may include explicit directives about speed or comfort, are incorporated into semantically meaningful embeddings.\nMultimodal Inputs: Visual, auditory, and biomechanical cues (e.g., from onboard cameras, IMUs, or EMG sensors), fused within a multimodal encoder (Driess et al., 2023) or CLIP-like encoders (Radford et al., 2021).\nThe Sensing Module outputs a high-level proposal about how to adjust the robot control parameters (e.g., torque, stiffness). In essence, it acts like a \u201cmultisensory integrator\" that also factors in the user's explicit linguistic preferences. This is reminiscent of how the central nervous system merges sensory feedback with high-level goals to plan motor commands (Fuster, 2002)."}, {"title": "4.2. Module 2: Ad-hoc Teamwork Model", "content": "Cognitive Science and Joint Action Parallels. In cognitive science, joint action explores how individuals coordinate tasks by internally representing each other's goals and actions (Sebanz et al., 2006). The brain also employs partial models of another person's internal states in collaborative tasks, often referred to as shared intentionality (Bratman, 1992). When humans collaborate, they engage in shared intentionality, and mutual understanding and prediction of each other's inten-tions, states, and possible actions (Bratman, 1992). Neuroscientific research further reveals that humans utilize a form of theory of mind (Baron-Cohen et al., 1994), allowing one to infer another's mental states, thereby enabling synchroniza-tion in activities such as dancing, carrying a table together, or passing objects. These mechanisms underpin our ability to anticipate partners' behavior, rapidly adapt to unexpected changes, and maintain coordinated trajectories.\nDesign Concept. Robot foundation models can adopt a similar approach, treating the user's state (fatigue, intention, com-fort preference) as an evolving variable to be modeled, not just a passive source of commands. This enables collaboration by predicting user behavior in advance, leading to more coordinated and synergistic interactions. Adapting these ideas, our Ad-hoc Teamwork Model views the device and user as two agents collaborating under imperfect information. The cumulative function of this module is:\nIntent Inference: The device (e.g., a leg prosthesis) cannot directly \"read\" the user's mind but can infer the user's short-term goals and motor patterns from EMG signals, gait kinematics, and language cues."}, {"title": "4.3. Module 3: Predictive World Belief Model", "content": "Internal Forward Models in Neuroscience. A substantial body of research in motor neuroscience underscores the role of internal forward models, which predict the sensory outcomes of motor commands, adjusting subsequent behavior in anticipation of future states. (Wolpert & Kawato, 1998; Kawato, 1999). Predictive coding theories go further, proposing that the brain's cortex continuously attempts to minimize prediction errors by updating these models (Friston, 2009).\nDesign Concept. Drawing inspiration from these frameworks, our Predictive World Belief Model maintains a probabilis-tic, forward-looking estimate of both the user's internal states (muscle fatigue, comfort thresholds, intention shifts) and external conditions (terrain type, slope, potential obstacles). By modeling these dynamic processes over time, this module achieves:\nAnticipatory control: The device (e.g., a leg prosthesis) adjusts torque or joint impedance before the user's foot meets a slippery or uneven surface.\nContext-specific transitions: It can predict that a user's gait may shift from walking to running or from level-ground to stair ascent, adjusting control parameters accordingly.\nUnlike simple threshold-based controllers or purely reactive controllers, a model-based approach predicts the probability distribution of future states. Bayesian strategies, along with predictive coding frameworks (Rao & Ballard, 1999; Friston, 2009), can be leveraged to continuously update such forward-model estimates."}, {"title": "4.4. Module 4: Memory & Feedback for Refinement", "content": "Long-Term Plasticity and Reinforcement in Biology. Neuroscience literature emphasizes how synaptic plasticity through feedback-driven processes, including dopamine-mediated reinforcement signals, drive long-term changes in be-havior (Gerstner & Kistler, 2002; Dayan & Abbott, 2005). For instance, repetitive practice consolidates motor memories that lead to progressive refinement in the brain's motor representations and improved task efficiency.\nDesign Concept. Our Memory Module and Feedback Mechanism incorporate analogous processes:\nLong-term preference storage: The device (e.g., a leg prosthesis) stores user-specific torque settings, comfort ranges, and frequent command patterns, similar to how repeated exposure to a task solidifies neural pathways in motor learn-ing.\nReinforcement-based updates: The device can query the user (\u201cIs this stiffness comfortable?", "bank": "Language-based preferences (\u201cI like a softer ankle when walking on grass"}, {"title": "4.5.

Aligning with the concept of online plasticity, the system should allow fre-quent updates based on real-time user feedback to maximize the user's cumulative comfort or functional metrics (e.g., walking speed, and joint stability). Each device undergoes an online adaptation phase, deploying techniques from con-tinual or reinforcement learning (Rolnick et al., 2019; Dayan & Abbott, 2005). The interacting robotic device thus refines parameters (e.g., stiffness range, torque profiles) while actively interacting with its user in real-world conditions, leveraging the Memory/Feedback mechanism.\nSafety and Interpretability. Human-interactive robotic devices necessitate robust safety constraints and interpretability.\nReflex-level safeguards: The framework should include a \u201clow-level reflex layer,\" analogous to spinal reflexes, (Wolpaw et al., 2002) to prevent unsafe actuator outputs.\nExplainability tools: Clinicians and users should be able to understand why the device chose specific parameters (e.g., a certain ankle torque), fostering trust and regulatory approval."}, {"title": "5. More Scenarios of Multi-Agent Coordination", "content": "While we emphasize user-device dyads such as cyborg systems, the same multi-agent logic can apply to developing foun-dation models for extended scenarios such as:\nCollaborative Task Environments: In settings where multiple robotic agents operate alongside human users, such as in industrial manufacturing, disaster response, or healthcare, multi-agent coordination enables seamless collaboration. For instance, in a manufacturing assembly line, multiple robots can dynamically adjust their roles and tasks based on real-time production demands and human worker inputs. Similarly, in disaster response scenarios, a team of drones and ground robots can coordinate their efforts to search for survivors, navigate hazardous terrains, and relay critical information, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the mission (Barrett et al., 2017).\nGeneralist Models for Smart Homes: In human-interactive systems, such as personal assistants or smart home envi-ronments, multi-agent coordination allows for more personalized interactions. Multiple agents can manage different aspects of the environment (e.g., lighting, climate control, security) while collaboratively adapting to the user's prefer-ences and routines. This can lead to a more cohesive and intuitive user experience, where the system anticipates and responds to the user's needs.\nGeneralist Synergy Models: A single user might utilize a lower-limb prosthesis, an upper-limb orthosis, or additional wearable sensors for rehabilitation. Each device can maintain a local instance of the same foundation-model frame-work, with the potential for coordinated synergy if they share a global representation of the user's state. For instance, an upper-limb exoskeleton might stiffen its elbow joint to assist balance when it detects that the lower-limb prosthesis is transitioning to a challenging slope.

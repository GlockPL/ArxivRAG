{"title": "Overcome the Difficulties of NSGA-II via Truthful Crowding Distance with Theoretical Guarantees", "authors": ["Weijie Zheng", "Benjamin Doerr"], "abstract": "The NSGA-II is proven to encounter difficulties for more than two objectives, and the deduced reason is the crowding distance computed by regarding the different objectives independently. The recent theoretical efficiency of the NSGA-III and the SMS-EMOA also supports the deduced reason as both algorithms consider the dependencies of objectives in the second criterion after the non-dominated sorting but with complicated structure or difficult computation. However, there is still a question of whether a simple modification of the original crowding distance can help.\nThis paper proposes such a variant, called truthful crowding distance. This variant inherits the simple structure of summing the component for each objective. For each objective, it first sorts the set of solutions in order of descending objective values, and uses the smallest normalized L\u2081 distance between the current solution and solutions in the earlier positions of the sorted list as the component. Summing up all components gives the value of truthful crowding distance. We call this NSGA-II variant by NSGA-II-T that replaces the original crowding distance with the truthful one, and that sequentially updates the crowding distance value after each removal.\nWe prove that the NSGA-II-T can efficiently cover the full Pareto front for many-objective mONEMINMAX and mOJZJ, in contrast to the exponential runtime of the original NSGA-II. Besides, we also prove that it theoretically achieves a slightly better approximation of the Pareto front for ONEMINMAX than the original NSGA-II with sequential survival selection. Besides, it is the first NSGA-II variant with a simple structure that performs well for many objectives with theoretical guarantees.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The NSGA-II, the mostly widely used multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, starts its runtime analysis since [ZLD22, ZD23a], and recently received quite rapid attentions for further runtime analysis, especially for bi-objective optimization problems [ZD22, BQ22, ZD23b, DQ23a, DQ23b, DQ23c, DOSS23b, DOSS23a, CDH+23, ZLDD24, WD24]. Recently, it is proven to be inefficient for more than two objectives [ZD23b]. Zheng and Doerr [ZD23b] proved that the NSGA-II needs at least exponential iterations to cover the full Pareto front of the mONEMINMAX problem with the number of objectives $m \\geq 3$. They deduced the essential reason for this inefficiency lies on the crowding distance that treats the objective independently, which can result in an undesired situation that points far away have huge influence of the crowding distance calculation of current solution.\nThe NSGA-III, a variant of the NSGA-II that replaces the crowding distance by using the predefined reference points for some diversity maintenance, was proposed by [DJ14] to tackle the difficulties of the NSGA-II for many objectives. Recently, Wietheger and Doerr [WD23] proved that the NSGA-III can efficiently cover the full Pareto front of 3-ONEMINMAX, and later Opris, Dang, Neumann, and Sudholt [ODNS24] proved its efficiency for objectives more than 3. The SMS-EMOA is another variant of the NSGA-II that replaces the crowding distance by the hypervolume contribution, and is also recently proven to cover the Pareto front of mOJZJ in expected $O(\\mu Mn^k)$ iterations where $\\mu > M$ for $M$ the maximal size of incomparable solutions, $M$ the Pareto front size, $n$ the problem size, and $k$ the gap size. Obviously, the reference point mechanism in the NSGA-III and the hypervolume contribution in the SMS-EMOA consider the objectives dependently, and their efficiency verify that the non-dominated sorting in the NSGA-II works but the crowding distance has its deficiency. On the other hand, the structure of the NSGA-III is complicated as it does not use a straightforward calculation way as in the NSGA-II but needs many procedures, like non-trivial normalization, reference point association, number of selected points associated with the reference point, update the number"}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "This section introduces the original crowding distance in the NSGA-II with the difficulties in the existing literature, and also the problems that will be used for the analyses in this paper."}, {"title": "2.1 Original Crowding Distance in the NSGA-II", "content": "The original NSGA-II [DPAM02] designed a simple way of calculating the crowding distance with the framework of calculating the component for each objective and then summing them up. For each component w.r.t. an objective, it sorts the individuals in order and assigns the first and the last elements in the sorted list with positive infinite value and others the normalized distance between its left and right neighbors in this sorted list. Formally, let $S = \\{S_1,..., S_{|S|}\\}$ be the set of individuals, and $S_{i,1},..., S_{i,|S|}$ be the sorted list of $S$ w.r.t. $f_i$ for $i \\in [1..m]$, where $m$ is the number of objectives. Let $x \\in |S|$ has its position of $i_x$ in the sorted list w.r.t. $f_i$, that is, $x = S_{i,i_x}$.

However, the NSGA-II with this crowding distance has the theoretical difficulty for many-objective optimizations, and cannot be overcome by increasing the population size or using different parent selections, offspring generation ways, or survival selections [ZD23b]. The reason they deduced is the independent treatment of the objectives in calculating the crowding distance. Later, the efficiency of two variants of the NSGA-II considering the objectives dependently (NSGA-III [WD23, ODNS24] and SMS-EMOA [ZD24b]) also verify such finding. However, the NSGA-III has a complicated mechanism of reference point and the hypervolume in SMS-EMOA is expensive to calculate when the objectives become larger [DJ14, SIHP20, GFP21]. This paper attempts to design a simple and efficient variant of crowding distance for many objectives.\nBesides, together with this original crowding distance, the survival selection in the original NSGA-II also has possible difficulty (for some examples) for approximation [ZD24a]. Also in [ZD24a], they prove that the NSGA-II with the sequential survival selection, that is, updating the crowding distance after each removal, and the steady-state NSGA-II is proven to have a nice approximation for bi-objective ONEMINMAX. This paper will also consider such a fact for survival selection in the NSGA-II variant equipped with the designed crowding distance variant."}, {"title": "2.2 Problems to Analyze", "content": "As mentioned before, the difficulty of the NSGA-II with the original crowding distance for many objectives is proven for the mONEMINMAX benchmark [ZD23b].

Due to the limited space, we ignore the definitions of other benchmarks, mCOCZ, mLOTZ, COCZ, LOTZ, and DLTB [LTZ+02, LTZ04, ZLDD24], but also show the runtime of the proposed NSGA-II variant in Section 4.\nDefinition 1 (mOJZJ [ZD24b] and mONEMINMAX [ZD23b]).

It is undesired and stems from an independent consideration of the objectives in the calculation of the original crowding distance. More specifically, in the original crowding distance (1), the i-th component only relies on the values of $f_i$, no matter the values of other objectives $f_j, j \\neq i$. Thus, a point $y$ that is far away (w.r.t. $f$) from a point $x$ can join in the calculation of the i-th component of $cDis(x)$ if $f_i(x)$ and $f_i(y)$ are neighbors in the sorted list w.r.t. $f_i$. Note that the crowding distance is designed to reflect how crowded the area (where a point is located) is, and will be used as a quantitative measure that helps to remove the points in the crowded area in the survival selection procedure. Hence, this phenomenon is undesired for a suitable crowding measure.\nTo avoid the undesired influence of the far away points in crowding distance components, we need to identify the distance of points w.r.t. entire $f$. Independent consideration can only show the distance of points w.r.t. specific $f_i$, then a dependent consideration among all objectives $f_1,...,f_m$ is required. For easy calculation, we adopt the $L_1$ norm to reflect the distance.\nFollowing the original crowding distance, we consider a crowding distance variant as the sum of the components for each objective. For calculating the i-th component ($i \\in [1..m]$), we also sort the solutions according to $f_i$ values. Different from the original crowding distance that considers $f_i$ distance, we consider the smallest \u201coverall\" distance between a specific solution and the solutions not worse than it w.r.t. $f_i$.\nFor clear demonstration, we call the proposed crowding distance variant dependent crowding distance and denote it as $tCD$. Formally, let $S = \\{S_1,..., S_{|S|}\\}$ be the set of pair-wise non-dominated individuals, and we take the calculation of i-th component of the truthful crowding distance of $S_e$ as an example. Let $S_{i.1},..., S_{i.|S|}$ be the sorted list of $S$ (w.l.o.g. in descending order of $f_i$) and let $S_{i.j}$ be $S_e$ in the sorted list. Let $tCD(S_{i.1}) = +\\infty$.

They require three properties to utilize their proof, among which one is to ensure that there is always an individual in any future generation that weakly dominates any specific individual in the current solution and the other two are for parent selection and generating offspring.

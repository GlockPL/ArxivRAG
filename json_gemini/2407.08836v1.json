Therefore, we developed a set of novel evaluation metrics that leverage\nGPT-4's advanced capabilities to judge the quality of fault diagnosis.\nThe primary evaluation metrics used in our study are as follows:\nDiagnostic Accuracy: This metric measures the correctness of the fault\ndiagnosis provided by the LLMs. However, instead of a simple binary correct-\nness measure, we employ a graded accuracy score where partial correctness (e.g.,\nidentifying the correct fault type but not the exact component) receives a pro-\nportional score.\nExplainability Quality: Explainability is critical for trust and usability in\nfault diagnosis systems. GPT-4 evaluates the quality of the explanations gener-\nated by the LLMs based on clarity, completeness, and relevance. This includes\nassessing how well the LLMs justify their diagnoses and how understandable\ntheir explanations are to human operators.\nResponse Coherence: This metric evaluates the coherence and consistency\nof the LLMs' responses over a series of related queries. It is essential that the\nLLMs maintain logical consistency and provide coherent narratives, especially\nwhen follow-up questions are asked based on previous responses.\nContextual Understanding: Given the complexity of power grid systems,\nit is crucial that LLMs understand and utilize context effectively. GPT-4 judges\nhow well the LLMs incorporate contextual information from the dataset into\ntheir diagnostic processes and responses.\nBy using GPT-4 as an advanced judge for these metrics, we aim to obtain\na more comprehensive and nuanced evaluation of the LLMs' performance in\npower grid fault diagnosis tasks.

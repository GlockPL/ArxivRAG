Despite progress, there remains a significant gap in evaluating models' comprehension of professional, graduate-level, and even PhD-level scientific content. Current datasets and benchmarks primarily focus on relatively simple scientific tasks and figures, lacking comprehensive assessments across diverse advanced scientific disciplines. To bridge this gap, we collected a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from open-access scientific articles published in Nature Communications journals. This dataset spans 72 scientific disciplines, ensuring both diversity and quality. We created benchmarks with various tasks and settings to comprehensively evaluate LMMs' capabilities in understanding scientific figures and content. Our evaluation revealed that these tasks are highly challenging: many open-source models struggled significantly, and even GPT-4V and GPT-4o faced difficulties. We also explored using our dataset as training resources by constructing visual instruction-following data, enabling the 7B LLaVA model to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4V/o on our benchmark. Additionally, we investigated the use of our interleaved article texts and figure images for pre-training LMMs, resulting in improvements on the material generation task. The source dataset, including articles, figures, constructed benchmarks, and visual instruction-following data, is open-sourced.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, including Large Language Models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a,b) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) (Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving problems requiring educated knowledge across various domains, including mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Hendrycks et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022b), history, computer science, law, and technology (Hendrycks et al., 2020). While these models excel at tasks ranging from elementary to undergraduate-level knowledge, there is an increasing demand for more professional AI scientific assistants that can comprehend and process advanced, graduate-level, and even PhD-level scientific knowledge (noa, 2023; White, 2023; Vert, 2023).\nIn response, researchers have begun exploring the application of these generative models in fields such as biomedicine (Thapa & Adhikari, 2023), health (Tian et al., 2024), chemistry (Zheng et al., 2023; Bran et al., 2023), and material science (Xie et al., 2023; Miret & Krishnan, 2024) for purposes including research automation, education, and assistance (Meyer et al., 2023). A critical aspect of developing effective AI science assistants is their ability to understand academic scientific literature, which often includes complex figures like data visualization plots and charts, schematic diagrams, macroscopic and microscopic photographs, and other specialized content from various fields.\nHowever, there is currently a lack of comprehensive evaluation of models' understanding of professional PhD-level multimodal scientific knowledge, particularly with figures, across diverse scientific disciplines. Existing evaluations of LMMs on scientific problems are typically limited to up to college-level knowledge and a few science disciplines, such as computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology (Lu et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2023; Yue et al., 2023), as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, the evaluation of models' abilities to understand scientific figures has been restricted to simple charts and plots (Chen et al., 2020; Kahou et al., 2017; Siegel et al., 2016), and suffer from relatively narrow scopes and lower quality (Li et al., 2024).\nTo bridge the gap, we collected a multimodal, multi-discipline dataset MMSci from high-quality, open-access articles published in Nature Communications\u00b3, which are freely and permanently available upon publication under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license. This dataset spans 72 scientific disciplines, primarily within the natural sciences (the top 30 subjects with most articles can be seen in Figure 1). We created a benchmark to evaluate models' understanding of PhD-level multimodal scientific knowledge across various disciplines. The benchmark includes scientific figure captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks in various settings, thoroughly assessing LMMs' capabilities in understanding scientific figures and content. Our evaluation revealed significant challenges and deficiencies in current LMMs in interpreting scientific figures and content. Many open-source models struggled considerably with these tasks, demonstrating limited capability. Even GPT-4V and GPT-4o encountered difficulties in producing accurate, relevant captions and matching figures with their descriptions under challenging settings.\nFurthermore, our dataset includes a vast collection of high-quality academic articles and figures, which we explored as training resources to enhance models' understanding of scientific content. To achieve this, we constructed visual instruction-following data with discussions about figure content, structured as single or multi-turn interactions. Additionally, we investigated pre-training LMMs using our interleaved article text and figure images to improve their acquisition of scientific knowledge. Experimental results show that our visual instruction-following data enhanced the 7B LLaVA model, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4V/o on our benchmark. Moreover, experiments on a materials science task demonstrated that pre-training on our interleaved multimodal data could improve the performance on material generation. Overall, our contributions are threefold:\n\u2022 Data scope and quality: Our dataset is unique as it consists of high-quality peer-reviewed academic articles and figures across 72 diverse scientific disciplines.\n\u2022 Challenging benchmark: Our benchmark includes tasks with varying settings for comprehensive assessment. Our evaluation reveals notable deficiencies in current LMMs in effectively interpreting figures in scientific literature."}, {"title": "2 Related Dataset Work", "content": "Scientific Figure Understanding Scientific figures in academic articles convey rich, valuable information, and there has been extensive research on evaluating the understanding of these figures. Early approaches typically focused on data visualization figures. For instance, Chen et al. (2020);\nKahou et al. (2017); Kafle et al. (2018) created synthetic datasets comprising various types of plots and charts. To obtain more diverse and complex scientific figures, FigureSeer (Siegel et al., 2016)\nand SciCap (Yang et al., 2023) gathered computer science (CS) papers from arXiv to extract article figures from PDFs. More recently, ArxivQA/Cap (Li et al., 2024) collected papers from 32 subjects on arXiv. However, their collection still primarily focuses on CS and math, with limited inclusion of rich and diverse natural science subjects. Additionally, since these arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed, their quality is not guaranteed. In contrast, our dataset emphasizes natural science disciplines and collects high-quality, peer-reviewed articles and figures from the prestigious Nature Communications journals. Covering 72 diverse science disciplines, our dataset ensures both diversity and quality.\nMultimodal Science Problems With the advancement of LMMs, many studies have focused on evaluating their capabilities in solving scientific problems in a multimodal context. However, ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022a) primarily addresses problems ranging from elementary to high school levels (K1-12). SciBench (Wang et al., 2023) focuses solely on three science disciplines: physics, chemistry, and mathematics. MMMU (Yue et al., 2023) includes various subjects such as art, business, history, health, humanities, and technology, but its coverage of science subjects is limited to 25 disciplines according to the categories of the Nature website. In contrast, our dataset evaluates PhD-level scientific knowledge across 72 diverse scientific domains."}, {"title": "3 Data Curation", "content": null}, {"title": "4 Benchmarks", "content": "We developed two benchmark tasks with varying settings to comprehensively test models' comprehension of scientific articles and figures from different aspects, as shown in Figure 3."}, {"title": "5 Training Resources", "content": "Our dataset consists of rich articles and figure data, which we explore as training resources to enhance models' capabilities in comprehending scientific figures and content."}, {"title": "6 Benchmark Evaluation Results", "content": "We benchmarked various prevalent open-source and proprietary LMMs on the market, including: Kosmos-2 (Peng et al., 2023), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023), Qwen-VL-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), and the LLaVA series models (Liu et al., 2024, 2023), including LLaVA1.5-7B, LLaVA-Next (LLaVA1.6-Vicuna-7B), LLaVA-Next-Mistral (LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B), and the proprietary GPT-4V (Achiam et al., 2023) and GPT-4o. The exact model versions are provided in the Appendix. Additionally, we fine-tuned a LLaVA-Next (LLaVA1.6-Vicuna-7B) model using our visual instruction-following data, containing around 1,080k training samples, for one epoch. This resulted in our model called LLaVA-Next-MMSci.\nFor scientific figure captioning, we ran the inference three times and reported the average scores for BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), METEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) by comparing the generated captions to the oracle captions.

A recent study (Gruver et al., 2024) achieved promising results by utilizing LLaMA2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) for material generation. In this study, material crystal structures were represented as text strings, and the LLaMA2 model was trained to generate these structure strings. However, LLaMA2 may lack sufficient scientific knowledge to fully comprehend the principles of material generation.

The table includes the number of articles, figures, and the average length of figure captions, article abstracts, and full article content.\nA.1.4 Image Types\nManual Review Initially, our authors conducted a thorough manual inspection of the figures and sub-figures from 100 randomly sampled articles from the five major categories in MMSci. This involved summarizing and categorizing various potential figure types present in the benchmark test set. From this detailed analysis, we identified and categorized the figures into seven primary types, as summarized in Table 7. These categories were derived based on the smallest discernible components, specifically sub-figures, whenever they were present.\nAutomated Classification Using GPT-4o Following this review, we employed GPT-4o to automatically classify the images in the benchmark test set. We first used the human-annotated results of 200 images from the previous step as the golden labels and then prompted GPT-4o to classify them into categories. Cohen's Kappa score was calculated to be 0.72, showing a very high agreement score between humans and GPT-4o. So, we utilized GPT-4o to label all the image types.

A crucial aspect of developing effective AI scientific assistants is their ability to understand academic scientific literature, which often includes complex figures such as data visualization plots, charts, schematic diagrams, macroscopic and microscopic photograph, and other specialized content from a variety of scientific fields. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive evaluation for models' understanding of advanced PhD-level multimodal scientific knowledge, especially in the context of complex figures across diverse scientific disciplines. Existing evaluations tend to focus on simpler charts and plots (Chen et al., 2020; Kahou et al., 2017; Siegel et al., 2016) and suffer from narrow scopes and lower quality (Li et al., 2024).\nOur dataset, MMSci, is designed to address this gap. MMSci is a multimodal, multi-discipline dataset comprising high-quality, peer-reviewed articles and figures from 72 scientific disciplines, predominantly within the natural sciences. We created a benchmark to evaluate models' understanding of PhD-level multimodal scientific knowledge across these disciplines. Additionally, this dataset can serve as a training resource to enhance models' comprehension of multimodal scientific knowledge.\nA.2.2 Intended Use\nThis dataset is used to evaluate and enhance the large multimodal models (LMMs)' understanding of advanced multimodal scientific knowledge.\nA.2.3 Data Collection\nData Source The dataset comprises open-access articles published in Nature Communications.\nThese articles are freely and permanently accessible upon publication under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) License.

All article content is publicly accessible. All author information are also publicly available, and no personal information was explicitly extracted, stored, or used from the authors.\nA.2.4 Social Impact and Ethical Considerations\nBenefits The benefits of our dataset are two-fold: (1) Evaluation Benchmark: This dataset serves as a valuable evaluation benchmark for assessing the understanding of large multimodal models (LMMs) regarding scientific articles and figures. (2) Training Resources: It can be used as a training resource to enhance LMMs' comprehension of scientific articles and figures, improving their performance in various scientific and research-related tasks.\nA.2.5 Limitations\nCurrently, our evaluation benchmark primarily focuses on understanding figures in scientific articles based on the article content or not.

Despite these immense benefits, evaluating the quality of AI-generated documentation remains complex. Current accuracy metrics, such as Word Error Rate, F1 Scores, and Precision/Recall [Schloss and Konam, 2020], as well as recent innovations like BERTScore [Li et al., 2024], do not fully address the complexities and potential risks in clinical settings. This paper presents DeepScribe's methodologies for assessing the quality of AI-generated medical documentation, using comprehensive metrics to capture both technical completeness and accuracy, as well as less tangible concepts like user acceptance. The Major Defect-Free Rate (MDFR) and Critical Defect-Free Rate (CDFR) assess significant and critical error frequencies. The Captured Entity Rate (CER) and Accurate Entity Rate (AER) measure the relevance and precision of captured medical information. The Minimally-Edited Note Rate (MNR) reflects user acceptance through content-editing behaviors. The Medical Word Hit Rate (MWHR) evaluates the accuracy of transcribed medical terms. These metrics are used to derive the composite \"DeepScore\", representing the overall quality of autonomous transcription and scribing, guiding continuous improvement in patient care documentation."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Statistical Rates", "content": "At DeepScribe, we use Statistical Rates (Stat Rates) to track progress in overall model performance and to pinpoint areas of model regression, enabling our product and engineering teams to focus development effort where it can have the most impact."}, {"title": "2.1.1 Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1.2 Overview", "content": "Stat Rates is a DeepScribe system designed to evaluate the quality of medical notes by scrutinizing note content for completeness and accuracy. At its core, this method involves a detailed comparison of AI-scribed notes against a 'rubric'\u2014a note scribed by a human expert and vetted by peers- derived from the original audio of a clinical encounter. The AI-scribed note is assessed for defects which are classified by type and severity, ranging from minor inaccuracies to critical errors that could impact patient safety. This granular approach enables precise feedback that guides both the immediate corrections needed and broader developmental improvements in DeepScribe AI algorithms, ensuring that the system evolves to meet the high standards of medical documentation required for clinical efficacy and patient care."}, {"title": "2.1.3 Key Concepts", "content": "\u2022 Test Encounter: The foundation of Stat Rates is the evaluation of 'test encounters' - real but completely de-identified interactions between clinicians and patients, recorded and transcribed.\n\u2022 Test Note: The 'test note' generated by DSX, our product, from the test encounter transcript represents the practical output of our system, segmented into 'snippets' of information for detailed assessment.\n\u2022 Test Set: The full collection of test notes that we evaluate when running Stat Rates is called the 'Test Set'. We have constructed the Test Set to be a representative sample of our production notes, but periodically must update its composition to reflect the evolving mix of notes we scribe in production.\n\u2022 Rubric: Each test note is compared against a 'rubric', or a note that has been manually written from the same encounter's transcript by an expert human scribe, representing the best available human standard.\n\u2022 Entity: A rubric is parsed into 'entities', key pieces of medically relevant content that the test note must reflect accurately.\n\u2022 Snippet: A piece of medically relevant content in the test note, identified by an auditor.

They rely heavily on the predefined rubrics and defect severity scales which may not capture all nuances of medical dialogue or context.\n\u2022 Test Set Composition: As DeepScribe evolves and launches support for new specialties, the composition of the existing Test Set may no longer be representative of the mix of note types in production. This limitation means that the metrics derived from the Test Set might not fully capture the performance and quality of the system across additional medical specialties and new types of clinical encounters.\n\u2022 Subjectivity in Severity Judgments: The effectiveness of these metrics can be significantly influenced by human subjectivity in assigning defect severity levels. Variability in judgment among different reviewers assessing the same defects can lead to inconsistencies in the data, impacting the reliability and comparability of the outcomes.\n\u2022 Training and Calibration Challenges: Consistency in defect severity scoring requires continuous training and calibration among evaluators. Without rigorous standardization, the subjective nature of defect classification can undermine the objective assessment of note quality."}, {"title": "3.2 User Acceptance", "content": "\u2022 Subjectivity and Variability: This metric is influenced by individual user behavior and subjective judgment, which can vary widely among users. As such, high editing rates might reflect personal preference rather than objective errors, potentially skewing the data on system performance.\nFor example, when adding words, users may frequently add context that is not part of the transcript.\nWhen deleting words, users may be dropping content that is relevant but that they don't want cluttering the note for reasons of their own unique preference."}, {"title": "3.3 Transcription QC", "content": "\u2022 Scope Limitation: MWHR focuses exclusively on the accuracy of medical terms, which, while crucial, represents a fraction of the overall content of clinical notes. This narrow focus might overlook other types of errors that could also impact the usability and understanding of the notes.\n\u2022 Audio Quality Dependence: The effectiveness of MWHR is contingent upon the quality of the audio input. Poor audio quality can lead to misinterpretations and incorrect transcriptions, significantly affecting the metric's reliability.\n\u2022 Small-Sample Volatility: Due to the costly and time-intensive nature of calculating the metric, we relied on a fairly small sample of 10 notes to estimate MWHR.

By integrating various metrics\u2014such as Major Defect-Free Rate (MDFR), Critical Defect-Free Rate (CDFR), Captured Entity Rate (CER), Accu- rate Entity Rate (AER), Minimally-Edited Note Rate (MNR), and Medical Word Hit Rate (MWHR)\u2014we demonstrate a robust system for evaluating the performance of our AI medical note-scribing system.

By zero-shot we mean that, for a novel environment, we feed a VLLM an image of the robot's environment and a description of the task, and have the VLLM output the sequence of actions necessary for the robot to complete the task. Prior work on VLLMs in robotics has largely focused on settings where some part of the pipeline is fine-tuned, such as tuning an LLM on robot data or training a separate vision encoder for perception and action generation. Surprisingly, due to recent advances in the capabilities of VLLMs, this type of fine-tuning may no longer be necessary for many tasks. In this work, we show that with careful engineering, we can prompt a single off-the-shelf VLLM to handle all aspects of a robotics task, from high-level planning to low-level location-extraction and action-execution. Wonderful Team builds on recent advances in multi-agent LLMs to partition tasks across an agent hierarchy, making it self-corrective and able to effectively partition and solve even long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments on VIMABench and real-world robotic environments demonstrate the system's capability to handle a variety of robotic tasks, including manipulation, visual goal-reaching, and visual reasoning, all in a zero-shot manner. These results underscore a key point: vision-language models have progressed rapidly in the past year, and should strongly be considered as a backbone for robotics problems going forward.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The vision of robots comprehending and performing complex tasks based solely on natural language instructions, without any prior training, is becoming increasingly attainable due to advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). These models integrate vision and language, enabling robots to intuitively understand their environments, leveraging real-world priors obtained from the large-scale data used to train the VLLMs. Even so, developing a general-purpose robotic system capable of executing complex tasks in dynamic settings remains a significant challenge, requiring the ability to perceive surroundings, utilize appropriate skills, and achieve long-term subgoals. However, the continually improving capabilities of VLLMs in-context-understanding and spatial-reasoning provide a promising foundation. These models excel in zero-shot scenarios across various domains. This raises a crucial question: Can these models be adapted to solve robotic tasks in unstructured environments without any training?\nCurrent work in language-conditioned robotics models has often restricted LLMs and VLLMs to high-level planning roles, leaving action generation to pre-defined task modules or APIs [1, 2, 3] or"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Foundation Models Trained on internet-scale datasets, foundation models have demonstrated strong zero-shot ability in various tasks. LLMs and VLLMs are prime examples. LLMs like GPT-3 [18], LLaMA [19], and ChatGPT have excelled in generating human-like text, understanding natural language instructions, and performing extensive reasoning and planning. In this paper, we investigate how those planning and reasoning abilities can be used to benefit robotics.\nEmpowered by Language Models Prior work in robotics has shown that natural language instructions can help agents learn and adapt to new tasks. However, these earlier approaches either: 1) equipped agents with learned language embeddings, which require collecting large amounts of training data [20, 13]; 2) focused on connecting language instructions with low-level action primitives to solve long-horizon tasks [1, 2, 3]. These methods often struggle with adapting to new tasks. To improve generalizability, recent research has explored foundational transformer-based models like RT-1 [21] and RT-2 [22], which have laid the groundwork for versatile robotic systems. Despite their advancements, these models still require significant training to achieve robust performance across diverse tasks.\nZero-shot and Few-shot Approaches Recent works [23, 3, 2, 7, 10, 14, 24, 25] have explored zero-shot and few-shot solutions for robotics planning and manipulation tasks. While these approaches can handle unseen scenarios without any training, they focus on high-level planning and often rely on pre-defined programs to manage control.

Their approach focuses on providing a one-shot example, either from the same task or a slightly different task, rather than a zero-shot paradigm. Their work serves as one of the baselines in our experiment section.\nLet's first consider the simplest robotic vision-language interface, which was our initial approach in this investigation. First, an image of the robot's current environment observation is captured. Then, tick marks with are appended to the borders of the X and Y axes of this image, defining a coordinate system for the task in pixel space. For example, if we have a 100 \u00d7 100 image and define our coordinate space to start at (0,0), then the upper right corner of the image would be (100, 100). We aim to feed this augmented image into a VLLM, along with a description of the task we wish to"}, {"title": "4 Experimental Results", "content": "To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on VIMABench [13], a recently proposed simulation benchmark designed to assess multi-modal robot learning agents. VIMABench offers a suite of 17 representative tabletop manipulation tasks that encompass a wide range of skills, incorporating numerous combinations of objects, textures, and initial configurations. The benchmark includes 29 objects with 17 types of RGB colors and 65 types of image textures, some of which are rarely seen in other robotics tasks, making them particularly valuable for testing our approach. We chose VIMABench because, unlike traditional simulation or real-world environments that mostly include easy-to-detect objects such as single-colored blocks or bowls, fruits, and other common items, VIMABench presents a significant variety of objects and textures (see Figure 2). Many of these objects require advanced scene understanding and careful planning for successful manipulation. Furthermore, VIMABench includes multi-modal prompts, featuring images of objects alongside textual instructions, which create a more complex and realistic testing environment. Additionally, many tasks in VIMABench require reasoning and long-horizon planning.\nWe conducted experiments on all 17 tasks in VIMABench. Full details about all 17 task types and their success rates are discussed in the supplementary materials. For the main paper, we adhere to the traditions established in the literature and choose to concentrate on four main task suites as defined by [13]:\nSimple Object Manipulation: Tasks like \u201cput (object) into (container)\u201d, where each image in the prompt corresponds to a single object."}, {"title": "5 Further Discussions", "content": "5.1 Comparison with Methods that Train\nMany times in recent years, the machine learning community has witnessed the zero-shot capabilities of freshly released LLM models exceed the performance of the previous generation's fine-tuned models.

To investigate this trend in the context of visual LLMs and robotics, we compare Wonderful Team with several methods that were at least partially fine-tuned on robotics tasks.\n5.2 Things are moving extremely fast\nWhile it is readily apparent to everyone that LLM progress has been rapid since 2021, it is perhaps less apparent how rapidly these capabilities are influencing robotics.

The prompt is:\n\"Place each fruit in the area that matches its color, if such an area exists.\""}, {"title": "6.2 Robot Setup Details", "content": "For our real-world experiments, we used the UFactory xArm 7, a versatile robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom, a maximum payload of 3.5 kg, and a reach of 700 mm. It was controlled via the xArm Controller using Python and ROS, facilitating seamless integration with our multi-agent system. The robot was equipped with a 2-finger gripper for manipulating various objects. The experiments were conducted on a standard laboratory workbench with predefined task areas, and the robot was calibrated before each experiment to ensure accurate positioning and movement. Our framework created a mapping between the relative displacement of the target position to the robot arm and the pixel coordinates used by the framework, enabling the robot to perform picking and placing actions at specified pixel coordinates.\nFor top-view RGB images used as input, we set up a camera directly above the predefined task area since the robot itself does not come with a camera. This setup ensured a clear and consistent view of the workspace, allowing the VLLM to accurately interpret the environment and plan actions."}, {"title": "6.3 Experimental Results", "content": "Our real robot experiments demonstrated that our framework successfully completed all three tasks 100% of the time, showing robust reasoning and planning capabilities. This section provides qualitative results from these experiments, illustrated in Figures 10, 11, and 12. These figures highlight specific aspects of the tasks, illustrating the effectiveness of our framework. It is important to note that these results only reflect the work of the planning team. The role of the grounding team, locating objects and determining their positions, is crucial for the successful execution of these plans.\nIn the fruit placement task (Figure 10), we present the final execution plan to illustrate the structure of a complete plan. Due to the straightforward nature of the task, this figure does not include the reasoning process. For the superhero companions and fruit price ranking tasks (Figures 11 and 12), we emphasize the reasoning process and omit the block for the complete final plan for the sake of conciseness. The final plans for these tasks are similar in structure to the fruit placement task, essentially combining the substeps in the execution sequence at the bottom of the figures.\nFor a comprehensive overview of the entire pipeline, please refer to Section 11 for detailed examples. Additionally, videos of the experiments and actual execution can be viewed here."}, {"title": "6.4 Limitations: Where does Wonderful Team struggle?", "content": "Throughout this work, we have identified several challenges that could be addressed for further improvement:\nPartial Observability: Vision-language models still struggle with partial observability. For instance, when an object is partially or fully obscured by another, the model fails to understand the spatial relationships and may hallucinate the actions required to arrange the objects in their stacked state. These failure modes are largely due to the inherent limitations of VLMs in perceiving occluded objects. Even with observability-specific prompting and explicit teaching of the concept of hidden objects, the models still fail to accurately interpret the scene.\nConsecutive Frame Understanding: While our framework can interpret multi-modal task instructions effectively, it faces challenges with more complex image prompts, such as consecutive frames each depicting multiple objects in different locations. VLMs find it difficult to accurately discern all differences and changes between consecutive frames. This often leads to compounded hallucinations when processing too many images simultaneously. Developing an effective yet generalizable method for breaking down such tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces could help mitigate this issue.\nWe further discuss the limitations of our framework with additional examples in the supplementary materials."}, {"title": "7 Appendix A: Improvements to the grounding team over time", "content": "Figure 13 shows the ability of Wonderful Team with VLLMs to generate at least one valid sub-goal, which shows the system is working to some extent but perhaps lacks more refined planning ability.\nPreviously, it was evident that earlier VLLMs, before GPT-40, struggled with finding actionable bounding boxes using a pixel coordinate system. The output coordinates were often not even in the same quadrant as the target object. However, by breaking down the task into a multi-agent system, this process does not need to be accomplished in a single step. If the model can effectively evaluate the quality of a bounding box or propose revisions, this task can be achieved iteratively in a multi-agent system.\nThe table in Figure 14 shows the performance of different models - gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, and Claude 3 opus - against the ground truth in a bounding box acceptance task. Interestingly, although generating a single-step coordinate is not possible for earlier models, they show some understanding of the environment and can evaluate a bounding box's correctness better than creating one from scratch. This suggests that breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable tasks can be helpful.\nDespite these advancements, hallucinations remain a significant issue. These hallucinations can compound within a multi-agent system, hindering its overall performance and reliability. This simple example exemplifies a portion of the workflow for the checking agent in the grounding team. If the checking agent hallucinates when a bad bounding box is provided and mistakenly deems it perfect, it will be outputted for action generation and result in execution failure. Conversely, if it keeps rejecting a good bounding box, it will confuse the proposal agent, leading to compounding hallucinations. This explains why, although the proposed framework significantly improves over single-shot coordinate generation, it still couldn't achieve good results when using earlier models."}, {"title": "8 Additional VIMABench Results", "content": "In the main paper, we presented results from a selective number of tasks within four categories out of the 17 VIMABench tasks. This was due to the nature of some tasks not being optimal for visual testing. For instance, the twist task requires the robot to determine the precise degree of rotation from before and after images, a challenge without prior training on such tasks.\nIn Table 2, we present the full experimental results across all 17 tasks of VIMABench. VIMABench defines six main categories of tasks, which are separated in the table by alternating grey and white blocks. From top to bottom, these categories are: Simple Object Manipulation, Visual Goal Reaching, Novel Concept Grounding, One-shot Video Imitation, Visual Constraint Satisfaction, and Visual Reasoning. Tasks marked with a star were excluded from the main paper's results for the following reasons:\n1. Nature of Tasks: Categories Visual Goal Reaching (Task 4 and 5) and One-shot Video Imitation (Task 10 and 11) were excluded because these tasks are not the best indicators of VLLM's capabilities without additional prompting.\n2. Missing Baseline Results: Tasks 8, 9, 13, and 14 were excluded due to the lack of available baseline results for comparison.\nA complete list of tasks with video illustrations can be found here."}, {"title": "9 Grounding Team Tools", "content": "Discussed in our methodology section, we provided a set of visualization tools to the grounding team, enabling team members to better understand any revision needs. The motivation behind providing these tools is straightforward. Consider asking a human to locate an object in a 1000 x 2000 frame in figure 16, such as finding the green bowl in the image. If only provided with the image on the left, one only knows the minimum and maximum of the x and y axes, which makes it difficult even for a human to determine close coordinates. However, when looking at the image on the right with added tick marks, it becomes much easier to identify the location with the reference provided. With this logic, we carefully considered what tools would be helpful for the VLLM to get more accurate positional information, similar to how humans work on such tasks."}, {"title": "10 Further Discussions on Motivation", "content": "Our primary motivation is to explore how we can best make use of the zero-shot capabilities of powerful VLLMs to solve robotic tasks. While previous works have combined different models or focused on training and fine-tuning specific components, our work focuses on exploring whether a single, powerful VLLM can be effectively employed in robotic tasks without any fine-tuning or training,\nAlthough it's currently not feasible to simply provide an environment image and receive a precise sequence of executable actions for task completion in a single step, VLLMs have shown the ability to generate plans and approximate the locations of objects in images. The question is: How do we leverage these capabilities of VLLMs to solve more complex tasks? Our solution is to divide and conquer, focusing on breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components.\nLet's break it down:\nFor successful task execution using founding models wihtout training on task-specific datasets, we need two main components:\n\u2022 A Correct Plan: For instance, \"1. Pick up the apple, 2. Put it in the box, 3. Pick up the banana, ...\".\n\u2022 Accurate Actions: Each part of the plan must correspond to an accurate sequence of actions, ensuring that the subgoals can be effectively reached.\nPrevious research has shown that LLMs are proficient at planning. However, generating accurate action sequences using LLMs is challenging due to the variability in robot controls. Different robots have distinct degrees of freedom and control mechanisms, making it difficult to instruct them without training or fine-tuning. To create a zero-shot framework that works effectively without additional fine-tuning, it is more effective to focus on locating positions and using environment-specific position control rather than generating specific actions.\nIn many real and simulated environments, position control is straightforward and ensures accurate movement between two positions. Even in environments with more complex physics, the relative relationships between objects and their corresponding actions remain consistent. For example, if object X is to the right of object Y, the action of moving the robot from X to Y is always moving to the left relative to the starting position.\nThus, even when this mapping is not perfect, a set of actions can be generated first and further refined through re-planning. Therefore, we break down the problem of action generation into position finding and position control."}, {"title": "11 Full Examples of System Inputs and Outputs", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.

{"title": "How Can We Diagnose and Treat Bias in Large Language Models for Clinical Decision-Making?", "authors": ["Kenza Benkirane", "Jackie Kay", "Maria Perez-Ortiz"], "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as powerful tools for clinical decision-making, with rapidly expanding applications in healthcare. However, concerns about bias remain a significant challenge in the clinical implementation of LLMs, particularly regarding gender and ethnicity. This research investigates the evaluation and mitigation of bias in LLMs applied to complex clinical cases, focusing on gender and ethnicity biases. We introduce a novel Counterfactual Patient Variations (CPV) dataset derived from the JAMA Clinical Challenge 1. Using this dataset, we built a framework for bias evaluation, employing both Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and corresponding explanations. We explore prompting with eight LLMs and fine-tuning as debiasing methods. Our findings reveal that addressing social biases in LLMs requires a multidimensional approach as mitigating gender bias can occur while introducing ethnicity biases, and that gender bias in LLM embeddings varies significantly across medical specialities. We demonstrate that evaluating both MCQ response and explanation processes is crucial, as correct responses can be based on biased reasoning. We provide a framework for evaluating LLM bias in real-world clinical cases, offer insights into the complex nature of bias in these models, and present strategies for bias mitigation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Despite LLMs offering promising potential for text generation across various domains, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to exhibiting social biases inherited from their training data (Sheng et al., 2021; Navigli et al., 2023). Bias in this context refers to a model's systematic tendency to unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups in favour of others (Friedman and Nissenbaum, 1996). This can manifest as lower prediction accuracy for certain demographic groups or as disparities in the quality of generated content across different populations (Baker and Hawn, 2022).\nIn healthcare, such biases may exacerbate health disparities and unfairly impact certain patient groups, posing significant risks where discriminatory outputs could lead to disparities in patient care and health outcomes (He et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023; Harrer, 2023; Singh et al., 2023). For example, a recent study from (Zack et al., 2024) revealed that GPT-4 exhibited a 9% lower likelihood of recommending advanced imaging for Black patients and an 8% lower likelihood of rating stress testing as highly important for female patients compared to male patients.\nCurrent approaches to evaluating LLMs in medical contexts primarily rely on Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) from standardised exams like the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) (Nori et al., 2023). While some models have achieved scores comparable to or surpassing those of human medical professionals (Cascella et al., 2024), excelling at multiple-choice questions does not necessarily equate to superior reasoning skills needed for real-world clinical practice, as highlighted by (Saab et al., 2024; Homolak, 2023; Harris, 2023; Kanjee et al., 2023). At the same time, researchers have called for more comprehensive and clinically relevant benchmarks (Longhurst et al., 2024; Nickel et al., 2024).\nIn response to these concerns and to address the need for more clinically relevant evaluation methods, (Chen et al., 2024) introduced the JAMA dataset, comprising complex clinical cases that test decision-making skills in realistic clinical scenarios. Our work builds on this challenge, using the JAMA Clinical Challenge dataset, which provides real-world, complex medical cases along with MCQs and explanations (XPLs), allowing us to evaluate the decision-making rationale behind clinical-decision making with LLMs.\nWe implement Counterfactual Patient Variations (CPVs) to evaluate bias in LLMs across clinical scenarios (see Figure 1). Our research explores prompt engineering and fine-tuning for bias mitigation, as well as a real-world evaluation without multiple-choice labels given. Our framework incorporates a wide array of metrics for bias quantification, including accuracy comparisons, statistical measures, feature importance analysis, and embedding-based assessments. We address three main research questions: RQ1: Extent of LLM bias in CPV across gender and ethnicity in complex clinical scenarios. RQ2: Effectiveness of prompt and fine-tuning strategies in mitigating bias. RQ3: Fairness differences between structured MCQ and open-ended clinical explanations.\nWe find that LLMs exhibit pervasive gender and ethnicity biases in outcomes and reasoning, with discrepancies between MCQ performance and XPL quality revealing persistent biases despite apparent balanced accuracy. Fine-tuning can mitigate some biases but may introduce new ones, particularly across ethnic categories. Prompt engineering alone is insufficient for comprehensive debiasing, with effectiveness varying across models and demographics. Gender bias in LLM embeddings varies considerably across medical specialities, necessitating domain-specific debiasing strategies.\nOur main contributions are:\na) A novel CPV framework enabling systematic"}, {"title": "2 Dataset creation: JAMA Clinical Challenges with Counterfactual Patient Variations", "content": "Dataset scope and sources This study uses the JAMA Clinical Challenge, a collection of clinical cases extracted from the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Clinical Challenge archive, focusing on complex cases: cases that pose significant diagnostic challenges, encouraging readers to engage in critical thinking and apply their clinical knowledge. Each case comprises a detailed patient description (250 words), a specific clinical question, four answer options, the correct answer index, a discussion (500-600 words) elaborating on the preferred option, and a medical speciality classification. Appendix A.1 provides a representative sample, as well as a description of JAMA specialities. We extracted data in two phases: an initial extraction following (Chen et al., 2024)'s instructions, resulting in the JAMA_Chen2024 dataset (1,522 cases), and a subsequent extraction on 10 August 2024, creating the JAMA_CPV dataset (1,734 cases, July 2013 - August 2024), enabling access to 212 additional cases. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first analysis of the JAMA Clinical Challenge dataset for bias evaluation in LLMs and is the first to use the 212 additional cases. While (Chen et al., 2024) introduced the initial dataset, our study extends its application significantly in the context of bias evaluation and mitigation.\nClinical case feature extraction To facilitate gender swapping, identify questions asked, and gain insights into the patient population, we conducted extensive preprocessing of the dataset. This process began with a thorough human analysis of numerous clinical cases, which prompted the development of a rule-based system for feature extrac-"}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "Model selection We selected a diverse range of LLMs for our experiments, including GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301), GPT-40 (gpt-40-2024-05-13), GPT-4 Turbo (gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09), Haiku (Claude3 Haiku), Sonnet (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), Gemini (Gemini 3.5 Flash), Llama3 (LLama3-70B), Llama3.1 (LLama3.1-403B) for inference, as well as GPT-40 mini for fine-tuning.\nInference and prompts We developed multiple prompting strategies to evaluate different approaches to bias mitigation, based on initial work by (Chen et al., 2024) and prompting guidelines from (Liu et al., 2023), (Ganguli et al., 2023), and (Parrish et al., 2021). For the Exploratory CPV experiment, we enhanced the prompt by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) and follow-up questions about gender and ethnicity relevance. For the prompt bias mitigation evaluation experiment, we implemented three distinct prompts: a baseline question (Q), a debiasing prompt adding Instruction Following (Q+IF), and a combination of debiasing instructions with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Q+IF+CoT), a framework based on (Ganguli et al., 2023). Finally, the ablation study without multiple-choice used a modified version of the prompt mitigation's baseline prompt adapted not to provide the MCQ options. All the prompts are reported in Appendix G. To ensure consistent and deterministic outputs across all experiments, we set the temperature parameter to 0 for deterministic generation (Wang et al., 2023).\nFine-tuning For the fine-tuning experiment, we employed two task-specific paradigms: MCQ (Multiple Choice Question) and XPL (eXPLanation). For the MCQ task, we fine-tuned models on a dataset with case descriptions and options, outputting only the answer, while for the XPL task, we fine-tuned on a dataset with cases, options, and solutions, outputting only the explanation. We used OpenAI's fine-tuning platform with GPT-40 mini. The datasets for both tasks were carefully curated to ensure a balanced representation across genders and ethnicities, with the MCQ dataset containing 1,409 training examples and the XPL dataset containing 4,044 training examples. For the MCQ task, we trained for 2 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate multiplier of 0.8. The XPL task was trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 2 and a learning rate multiplier of 1.8. These hyperparameters were selected based on multiple iterations and performance on the validation set, balancing between model performance and generalisation.\nMetrics for bias quantification\nBy combining accuracy comparisons, statistical methods, SHAP analysis, and embedding-based measures, we provide a holistic view of bias manifestation, offering insights into performance disparities, underlying model behaviours, and latent biases in language representations.\nAccuracy Comparison We calculated accuracy scores across dimensions like gender, ethnicity, model type, and prompt variations.

Our findings reveal pervasive gender and ethnicity biases in both MCQ performance and explanation quality, with significant discrepancies between surface-level accuracy and underlying reasoning biases. This complexity underscores the need for frameworks that consider multiple bias evaluation metrics, as our multifaceted analysis reveals a much richer picture than simple accuracy assessments. By examining various aspects of LLM output, we unveil layers of bias that might otherwise remain hidden. The effectiveness of bias mitigation strategies varied across models and social attributes, while gender bias in LLM embeddings showed substantial variability across medical specialities. These nuanced results highlight the limitations of one-size-fits-all approaches and underscore the need for domain-specific strategies. Our methodology and dataset aim to offer substantive groundwork for future research, providing a foundation to explore the development of more equitable LLM-based clinical decision support systems in real-world settings."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "The absence of Healthcare Professional (HCP) input represents a notable limitation in our methodology. This oversight potentially compromises the clinical relevance and practical applicability of our findings. HCP consultation could have provided crucial validation for our scenario selection, identified clinically significant gaps or biases in model explanations, and offered insights into the real-world implications of model performance. Future research should address this limitation by incorporating HCP perspectives to enhance the robustness and clinical significance of the results.\nOur study evaluates various LLM families, yet focusing on a larger set of original clinical cases before applying Counterfactual Patient Variation (CPV) could have provided a more comprehensive assessment of bias across medical specialities. Expanding the initial dataset could enhance the breadth and depth of bias assessment in diverse medical contexts, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable findings.\nOur experiments employ a black-box approach, reflecting the prevalent use of closed-source LLMs and aiming to reproduce real-world scenarios. Whilst we included some open-source LLMs, we did not fully exploit their additional accessible information, maintaining consistency with our black-box methodology. A more comprehensive analysis of open-source models, including the examination of logits or saliency maps, could provide deeper insights. Such white-box analyses present intriguing avenues for future research extending this work.\nOur approach simplifies human diversity, using five ethnic categories and three gender options based on U.S. Office of Management and Budget standards Standards for [...] Data in Race and Ethnicity. This oversimplification overlooks crucial dimensions such as gender orientation, religion, nationality, skin colour, and socio-economic factors, which significantly impact health disparities 5 (Guevara et al., 2024). Future research should address these limitations to provide a more comprehensive representation of human diversity in healthcare contexts.\nWe notice that some cases in the JAMA dataset contain potentially biasing information alongside clinical data.

Developing specific evaluation methods for women's healthcare in LLM-based tools is crucial (Kent et al., 2012). Bias mitigation strategies could integrate advanced prompting techniques like DeCoT (Lanham et al., 2023) and leverage the Quiet-STaR approach (Zelikman et al., 2024) for real-time self-correction. A mixture of experts' approaches could address gender representation variations in medical specialities (Pradier et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "C Ablation study without multiple-choice options", "content": "Labels representation bias across gender The ablation study reveals significant differences in label representation bias between open-ended and structured MCQ formats.\nTable 17 shows the average word overlap with the ground truth.\nAll models show a consistent bias towards female patients in the open-ended format, with GPT-4o exhibiting the largest gap (1.81 points difference between female and male performance). This contrasts with the minor gender biases observed in the MCQ format of previous experiments.\nLabel embedding similarity bias across ethnicities Table 18 presents the exact match performance across ethnicities for GPT-40 and GPT-4 Turbo. GPT-40 shows a bias towards no ethnicity cases, with a 1.41% difference compared to the next highest ethnicity (Hispanic). GPT-4 Turbo exhibits more variability, with Asian cases performing 2.58% better than original cases. The WordCloud of label words across ethnicities, more precisely the world only existing with that specific ethnicity, for each language is displayed Figure 5. We observe the correlation between Hispanic patients and alcohol mentioned by Zack et al. (2024) with Gemini, but also a correlation with antihypertensive when using GPT-4 Turbo. On top of this observation, we find a wide range of word frequency and medical terms, suggesting that ethnicity did introduce a change in the explanation generation process in the models.\nGender Bias in Open-Ended vs. Structured Formats Figure 6 demonstrates a significant shift in gender bias when labels are not provided. All models exhibit negative Gender Bias across all patient genders, indicating a pervasive masculine-leaning tendency in open-ended responses. For example, Sonnet shows extreme negative values: -5.66 for females, -3.92 for males, and -3.34 for neutral patients. This contrasts sharply with the minor gender biases observed when labels are provided in the baseline experiment.\nFinally, this experiment shows that unlabeled clinical cases expose more profound gender and ethnicity biases in LLMs compared to structured MCQ formats. The consistent masculine-leaning tendency in open-ended responses suggests that providing labels in MCQ formats masks underlying biases in the explanation. Removing predefined options reveals subtle ethnicity-related linguistic associations and more pronounced gender biases, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of LLMs' biases in clinical contexts."}, {"title": "D Extended Results", "content": "D.1 Counterfactual Patient Variations\nAs shown in Table 19 and 20, the gender-specific and ethnicity-specific performance metrics for the Exploratory CPVs experiment reveal varying levels of accuracy and bias across social attributes for GPT-3.5, GPT-40, and GPT-4 Turbo models in both gender-only and gender-ethnicity contexts.

To address this limitation in the embedding calculation, we've incorporated a token-based sliding window approach as defined by Perea and Harer (2015). This method dynamically adjusts the window size based on the token count of the input text, rather than relying on a fixed number of samples. The sliding window technique transforms sequences of pre-trained embeddings into manageable chunks, allowing us to process and analyse long texts effectively. In our implementation, we set the maximum token limit $M = 68$ and the step size $S = 32$ tokens. For each window $W_i$, we accumulate samples $s_j$ until $\\sum_j|s_j| \\approx M$, where $|s_j|$ denotes the token count of sample $s_j$. The subsequent window $W_{i+1}$ begins at the first sample whose starting index is at least $S$ tokens away from the start of $W_i$.

Introduction", "content": "Recent updates from International Agency for Research on Cancer reveal that cancer is a major global health concern, affecting nations worldwide and posing a huge burden on healthcare systems. Global cancer-related mortality exceeded 10.0 million in 2020, while the number of newly diagnosed cancer cases reached approximately 19.3 million[1]. AI has transformed cancer research and treatment by leveraging its capability to detect complex patterns in medical data and provide accurate quantitative assessments of clinical conditions[2]. The influence of AI is evident in various fields today, such as banking, healthcare, and transportation, and it is anticipated to continue expanding.\nAl has been employed in academia to create intelligent tutoring systems, computer programs designed to address the unique needs of individual students. These methods have improved learning outcomes in various subjects, including science and math. However, AI's outstanding analytical abilities have potential to profoundly transform medical research, diagnosis, and treatment. The use of big data in healthcare research offers a unique opportunity to integrate data with complex study findings, requiring significant computational expertise [3, 4].\nHealthcare institutions face a variety of complex challenges, particularly those related to biological abnormalities like cancer. Al employs computational mathematical models that mimic human brain functions. Progress in combinatorial chemistry, genomics, and proteomics has made numerous databases of biological and chemical data available. These advancements could greatly deepen our understanding of molecular biology of cancer. A better grasp of cancer biology can substantially impact the evaluation and treatment of cancer patients in clinical settings. However, clinical oncologists face a significant challenge in choosing therapeutically relevant information from extensive raw genomic data now available [5]. Researchers have utilized AI to identify subgroups in various cancers based on gene, mRNA, and miRNAs clusters. The mRNA expression, miRNAs expression, and DNA methylation data were integrated using stacked autoencoders and deep flexible neural forest network models to categories tumors in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer into subcategories [6].\nBy utilizing RNA transcriptomics, miRNA transcriptomics, and DNA methylation data, the analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) employed both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. This approach identified consensus driver genes linked to patient survival and delineated two distinct patient subgroups with significantly different survival rates [7]. The integration of proteomics and metabolomics data analysis effectively classified a healthy group into low-risk and high-risk subcategories in breast cancer, as revealed by multi-omics data integration [8]. Two techniques, multiple-kernel frameworks and autoencoders, have been employed to integrate multi-omics datasets for the purpose of breast cancer sub typing [9].\nAI plays a crucial role in cancer assessment because it can recognize smaller groups of patients within larger groups based on data related to survival and prognosis. This enables the early detection of cancer and the prediction of its future course. AI was employed to categories patients into subgroups in neuroblastoma by identifying significant characteristics through the analysis of gene expression and copy number alteration data [10]."}, {"title": "1.1 Role of Al in Cancer Diagnosis by using medical imaging", "content": "Imaging tests such as MRIs, CT scans, and PET scans formed the basis of the previous cancer diagnosis procedure [22]. These traditional techniques may result in invasive or uncomfortable diagnostic procedures, and various healthcare professionals may have differing interpretations of the imaging data [23]. AI systems, especially those utilizing DL techniques, demonstrate exceptional proficiency in interpreting medical images and identifying abnormalities that are frequently overlooked by human observers.\nBy leveraging extensive cancer databases, it is possible to identify individuals at high risk of developing cancer by analyzing their health characteristics, thereby enabling early screenings. AI has potential to revolutionize cancer detection. For instance, Google's DeepMind project, in collaboration with the UK's National Health Service, developed an Al system capable of outperforming human doctors in accurately detecting over 50 eye diseases using 3D scans [24]. Furthermore, PathAI incorporates AI into the field of pathology in order to assist in the detection of various diseases, such as cancer. It ensures comprehensive detection of all possible elements, aiding pathologists in quickly recognizing patterns [25, 26].\nAl is also revolutionizing the field of medicine by offering exceptional precision the detection of many forms of cancers [27]. AI employs sophisticated algorithms and ML techniques to effectively and swiftly identify malignancies, a skill that was previously unattainable.\nAI algorithms provide a chance to enhance the precision of medical imaging, hence decreasing the amount of time physicians need to spend on patient care. A recent study published in Academic Radiology reveals that radiologists must assess an average of one image every three to four seconds in order to manage their daily workload. The integration of AI capabilities in image processing and radiography has the potential to enhance productivity in both domains. Mammography is the predominant technique used to identify breast cancer in its early stages, with more than 200 million women undergoing this procedure annually on a global scale.\nThe scientists proved their statement by examining 500 randomly selected cases and comparing them to previous assessments made by six professional radiologists, concluding that the AI system outperformed the radiologists' conclusions [28]. Overall, the US experienced a 5.7% reduction in false-positive results, while UK as a whole observed a 1.2% decline. Additionally, there was a 9.4% decrease in false negatives in US and a 2.7% decrease in UK. The findings of this first study open the path for larger clinical studies with the potential to improve the accuracy and efficacy of cancer diagnosis utilizing digital technologies [29]."}, {"title": "1.2 Clinical Applications of AI and Machine Learning", "content": "Clinical applications of cancer employ a diverse array of tactics and processes to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage the disease. These applications utilize advanced diagnostic technologies such as molecular profiling and genetic testing to detect specific cancer subtypes and develop personalized treatment recommendations."}, {"title": "1.2.1 Clinical Advantage of AI and Precision Oncology", "content": "Prior studies have unequivocally demonstrated the substantial benefits of AI in healthcare, with advancements occurring at an exceptionally rapid pace. For Al systems to be successfully integrated into clinical practice, they must perform at least as well as, if not better than, human intervention. In clinical settings, next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers numerous benefits for identifying prognostic or predictive biomarkers [34]. Over the past decade, NGS has significantly advanced in terms of speed, accuracy, affordability, and efficiency. Additionally, NGS has incorporated both short-read and long-read platforms. Short reads can be employed in precision medicine to detect polymorphisms that provide clinical advantages and for screening large populations, while long reads facilitate full-length isoform sequencing. The utilization of sophisticated algorithms to analyze complex datasets will unveil new opportunities for targeted therapies in precision oncology [35-37]. AI-driven integration of genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data, as shown in Figure 3, distinguishes cancer subtypes, predicts disease progression, and identifies therapeutic targets, enhancing personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment"}, {"title": "1.2.2 From Lab to Clinic: AI's Rapid Advancements in Cancer Care", "content": "For almost 20 years, AI has been used in cancer research. The area of cancer research has shown encouraging advancements, and noteworthy accomplishments at the level of expertise [39]. Al is also being used by a growing number of businesses and industry research groups to identify, diagnose, and treat cancer. IBM is leading the effort to incorporate AI into medical facilities. IBM introduced Watson, an AI system, in 2014 to provide cutting-edge medical support in the area of cancer research [40]. Corresponding to this, a group of researchers and computer scientists at Microsoft are working to use ML and NLP to create a programming framework that will allow them to manipulate biological processes in order to treat cancer. However, there are concerns over the regulation of AI tools. In 2022, the FDA authorized more than sixty medical devices or algorithms powered by AI, as determined by Jaber's research [41].\nAl is positioned to transform the medical industry by facilitating suggestions and recommendations for treatment options, improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosis, and advancing prognostic outcomes [42, 43]."}, {"title": "1.2.3 Consensus regarding the AI procedure in clinical cancer research", "content": "AI is presently employed exclusively in an adjunctive capacity within medicine. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the potential for technology to eventually supplant human expertise in diagnostic imaging, treatment decision-making, and other areas. Currently, AI encounters numerous challenges in cancer research, particularly in the development and evaluation of solutions. To verify the capabilities of AI effectively, meticulously designed testing protocols are paramount. Consequently, an ideal framework is essential to facilitate the advancement of AI methodologies. Prior to the implementation of an Al solution, it is crucial to define and characterize the specific issues to be addressed and to evaluate whether addressing these issues is both feasible and beneficial [44]. Multiple clinical data sets reveal an inherent disparity in the allocation of samples among different classes. When dealing with distinguishing features like asymmetry, classification algorithms which are typically built to handle balanced classes may encounter difficulties [45]. Three separate categories training, validation, and testing sets are used to group the available data. This category facilitates an impartial assessment of the AI model. The typical ranges are 60\u201370%, 15\u201320%, and 15\u201320%. Al employs three separate datasets: training,"}, {"title": "2. Role of Al in various cancers", "content": "AI, especially DL, has made significant strides in cancer clinical research thanks to the increasing amount of contemporary biological data. AI-based technologies are increasingly being employed to improve accuracy and efficiency in a variety of cancer clinical research applications. These include the detection of cancer by imaging, the analysis of genetic data, the extraction of important information from medical records, the development of new drugs, and the utilization of biological literature. Furthermore, we will analyze the limitations of traditional methods and the importance of AI in the context of the ten most prevalent types of cancer worldwide."}, {"title": "2.1 Lung Cancer Detection and AI", "content": "Lung cancer is primary cause of cancer-related fatalities on a global scale and is among the most commonly diagnosed malignancies. About 2.20 million new patients receive a lung cancer diagnosis each year [47]. Additionally, 75% of people with a diagnosis die within five years [48]. The challenge in treating cancer has arisen due to intricate nature of cancer cells and the significant intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH), which results in the development of medication resistance [49]."}, {"title": "2.2 Application of Machine learning (ML) for lung cancer early detection and supplementary diagnosis", "content": "Applying ML techniques facilitates early diagnosis and detection by analyzing medical imaging datasets. Timely identification is crucial in reducing lung cancer mortality rates [59]. The primary method for monitoring individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer is low-dose computed tomography (CT) for chest screening [60]. The main objective of developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is to enhance efficiency of medical diagnostics. These systems assist clinicians in analyzing medical imaging data, providing a valuable additional perspective [61]. Traditional feature-based CAD tasks consist of three phases: nodular segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and clinical judgment inference (classification). Various techniques are available for predicting the probability of cancer using ML classifiers, including logistic regression (LR) [62] or linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [63], which consider the observed textural properties of specific nodules in CT images along with the patient's clinical data.\nCT images commonly provide factors such as nodule size, type, location, count, border, and emphysema information. Clinical variables include the patient's age, gender, time of specimen collection, family history of lung cancer, and smoking history, among others. However, these traits"}, {"title": "2.3 AI in Lung Cancer detection and subtype Differentiation", "content": "It is challenging to implement periodic medical imaging scans, which are advised for high-risk groups, due to a high probability of false detection [83, 84]. That is why it is essential to develop more effective methods for early detection of lung tumours. The numerous applications of AI and ML are illustrated in Figure 5. Advancements in sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of an abundance of instruments for the early detection of lung cancer. [85]. However, it is crucial to precisely classify different subtypes of lung cancer in order to guide the selection of the most efficient treatment strategies. Except for targeted therapy, the management of the two most common subtypes of lung cancer, LUAD (45%) and LUSC (25%), is often done in a similar manner [86]. Nevertheless, studies have shown that LUAD and LUSC have distinct biological characteristics, indicating that these two forms of cancer should be classified and treated as separate entities [87]. Early detection and subtype identification using a computer approach are both included in the classification job.\nTo ascertain the relative abundances of each cell type in the images, the segmented cells were then employed in cell type classification. This model allows for the precise differentiation of immune evasion mechanisms and differential evolution between lung LUAD and LUSC with exceptional precision.\nA subsequent analysis[88] categorized tissue as LUAD, LUSC, or normal based on H&E-stained Histopathological whole-slide pictures using the Inception-V3 network [89]. An important feature of this research is that the model shows the ability to predict the occurrence of somatic mutations in different driver genes of lung cancer, including STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS, and TP53, in a specific tissue. Several studies utilized transfer learning to improve the effectiveness and resilience of their novel model training procedures [90], considering the significant resources and complex nature of the datasets.\nPrevious research in ML has shown that massive pan-cancer sequencing datasets can be effectively used to classify different types of cancer and detect them at an early stage [91, 92]. These results may provide evidence that supports the validity of the lung cancer diagnosis. Cancer cells are characterized by a multitude of genetic changes, which can be used as distinctive markers to document the specific mutational patterns associated with different forms of cancer [93, 94]. Current research has mostly concentrated on improving the accuracy of their ML models by extracting superior genetic signatures as input features."}, {"title": "2.4 AI in Cancer Immunotherapy: Enhancing Treatment Predictions and Personalized Approaches in lung cancer", "content": "Immunotherapy is currently a crucial component of cancer treatment. Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which target pmd1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are used in blockade treatment. [116], have demonstrated efficacy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [117, 118]. Immunotherapy has shown significant effectiveness and is now more widely used than traditional therapies including radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy. The various responses observed across people can be attributed to the distinct characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of each patient. Therefore, it is fundamental to accurately forecast whether a patient will exhibit a positive response to immunotherapy to efficiently manage cancer. The development of AI technology has made it possible to create systems that can predict how a patient will respond to immunotherapy.\nAI-based methods utilize signatures obtained from medical imaging and immunological sequencing [119]. Wiesweg et al. [120] utilized gene expression patterns and cell type-specific genes to train an auxiliary support vector machine (SVM) classifier for RECIST categorization in response to PD-1/PD-L1 blocking therapy. Moreover, studies have investigated the utilization of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scans and radiomics biomarkers and imaging features to educate classifiers for RECIST classification [121, 122]. Some well-known classifiers in this category include logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Evaluating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is an essential part of assessing the response to immunotherapy.\nThe CIBERSORT model was refined by DeepTIL [123] to determine the amount of leukocyte subsets in a tumor sample. In contrast, alternative studies utilized radiomics characteristics derived from CE-CT images and RNA sequencing data to predict the prevalence of specific T cell subsets [124]. In addition, a DL model was developed to identify tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in"}, {"title": "2.5 Limitation for Lung Cancer detection", "content": "Even with notable progress in the use of ML in clinical lung cancer research, there are still issues that will likely influence the direction of further studies in this area.\nAccurately obtaining sensitive information from imaging data is essential for therapeutic applications. Unlike its predecessors, which used arbitrary feature extractions [134], DL-based CAD systems employ CNN models [135]. Significantly, the advent of Vision Transformer (ViT) [136] demonstrates potential in the analysis of imaging data, surpassing the efficiency and precision of conventional CNNs. On the other hand, DL models have shown effectiveness in other types of omics analysis. Genomics data analysis utilizes approaches such RNNs and CNNs.\nIn addition, to dealing with the complexity of omics data with many dimensions, autoencoders, deep generative models, and self-supervised learning models improve the process of extracting important features and reducing the number of dimensions.\nWhile it is typical to gather many kinds of information from one patient, the process of combining data from different platforms is still difficult because of the interference caused by platform noise. Various medical classification networks aid in the analysis of a diverse array of medical pictures, while the incorporation of data integration and the removal of batch effects help reduce noise in sequencing data. In spite of continuous efforts to create integrative tools, batch effects continue to be a major source of worry and full answers to the problems unique to each platform in clinical investigations are still elusive.\nThe implementation of medical studies is hampered by the lack of robustness and generalizability in ML models. The differences observed in various researches regarding the choice of marker genes for categorization highlight the need for markers that are both biologically meaningful and applicable across different contexts. The efficiency and strength of models may be enhanced by employing transfer learning with pre-existing models. This approach provides a practical solution to create unified and standardized DL frameworks for analyzing lung cancer data. To ensure the ongoing advancement of ML in lung cancer research, it is crucial to address these challenges. This will ultimately result in better clinical results and individualized treatments for cancer [137-140]."}, {"title": "3. AI In the prognosis of Breast Cancer", "content": "One of the most common and well-researched cancers is breast cancer, which has several subtypes identified by their molecular profiles [141]. The mortality rate for breast cancer among diagnosed women in 2022 was roughly 29.1%, resulting in 670,000 fatalities out of 2.3 million recorded cases [142]. Although there have been improvements in identifying and treating breast cancer, it continues to be a major issue in world health [143].\nThe primary focus of efforts to prevent and manage breast cancer is on secondary prevention, which entails improving screening for those who are at a high risk. Timely identification and medical intervention for breast cancer are also crucial in implementing these measures [144, 145]. The most significant benefit of AI in breast cancer screening is its ability to alleviate the workload of imaging specialists by efficiently identifying tumor lesions within the extensive image dataset of healthy individuals [146]. CADe/CADx systems serve as the basis for the advancement of AI- assisted breast imaging diagnostics. Radiologists depend on CAD, which is a prominent form of ML, to aid them in identifying small tumor lesions that may otherwise be overlooked. This is accomplished through the incorporation of mathematics, statistics, image processing, and computer analysis.\nHowever, the use of CAD identification in clinical practice is limited due to the high occurrence of false positive results and the need for biopsies [147, 148]. The input picture data is used as a training set to build a model in order to improve the functioning of CAD. The system is capable of obtaining clinical data sets, standardizing the data sets using neural networks, choosing ML classification algorithms, and assessing its overall performance [149]. A substantial quantity of high-resolution breast examination photos is required as the training dataset for a deep learning- based AI application tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer [150]. Furthermore, it is imperative to create a DL system that maintains uniformity across different users, devices, and modes of operation. Tumor images can be annotated either manually or using DL techniques to label the characteristics and boundaries of the lesions. Annotating images manually necessitates the proficiency and understanding of an imaging specialist. The manually designated lesions act as reference points for the automatic segmentation process.\nHowever, it can be difficult to distinguish between normal breast tissue and tumors that have small sizes or unclear characteristics. Furthermore, endo breast is more prevalent in Asian women, namely those who are premenopausal or have undergone estrogen replacement therapy [151] which further complicates tumor segmentation. Consequently, the lesions identified by experts do not accurately and thoroughly represent the true size and extent of the lesion, and the level of consistency in terms of being able to repeat the results is insufficient [152, 153]. Clustering-based, thresholding-based, region-based, edge-based, and other segmentation approaches are commonly used in automatic image segmentation methods. Currently, there is no widely recognized benchmark for image segmentation algorithms. DL algorithms are commonly linked with neural network algorithms."}, {"title": "3.1 Challenges in the current detection methods and Role of AI in Breast Cancer", "content": "Medical imaging is the most effective method for identifying breast cancer, utilizing various modalities such as MRI, CT, PET, mammography, radiographic ultrasonography, and duplex ultrasound. Medical images are essential for diagnosing diseases, identifying abnormal areas, providing patient treatment, and suggesting various disorders.\nAI and ML may be responsible for the most recent advancements in medical image analysis. Breast cancer diagnoses are now more precise than ever before as a result of these advancements in early detection and evaluation of malignancies. Breast cancer detection methods include computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography, X-ray mammography, and breast temperature measurement [158]. Typically, pathology diagnosis is considered the most reliable method for detecting breast cancer. In this process, extracted tissue is stained in the laboratory to enhance visibility in the resulting images, with hematoxylin and eosin being commonly used stains [159]. There are two primary approaches for diagnosing breast cancer: genomics and histological image analysis. Histopathological images, which are microscopic photographs of breast tissue, are particularly valuable for early-stage cancer treatment. The limitations of current diagnostic methods are summarized in Table 3."}, {"title": "4. AI in Colorectal Cancer (CRC)", "content": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent type of cancer in 2020, behind lung and breast cancers. It occupies the top position for males and the second position for girls. Annually, approximately 1,931,590 new cases of CRC are detected, accounting for 10.01% of all cancer cases.\nCRC accounts for 17.6% of all cases in Asia. Contributes to 8.7% of all cancer-related fatalities. The rising incidence of CRC is a significant health issue in developing nations. Environmental factors contribute to the development of CRC, as shown by the variations in global incidence rates and the increased risk among immigrants who move from regions with low prevalence to regions with high prevalence within the same generation [172].\nCRC manifests as an abnormal proliferation of epithelial cells, forming a tumor in either the colon or rectum [173]. The global incidence of cancer, specifically CRC, is on the rise. Genetic variations and environmental factors contribute to the probability of getting CRC. Furthermore, those diagnosed with colitis and Crohn's disease are inclined to get cancer, specifically CRC, as they age. Multiple academic research have revealed that diet and lifestyle choices, family history, and persistent inflammation are factors that add to the chance of developing cancer [174]. CRC is more prevalent in modern cultures, primarily due to the adoption of Western diets and lifestyles characterized by high consumption of meats, fats, and overall calorie intake. Changes in population composition and increased longevity are contributing to a wider range of factors affecting the situation [175]."}, {"title": "4.1 Traditional Methods for the Detection of Colorectal Cancer", "content": "People over 50 are advised to have a digital rectal examination (DRE) at least once by the Indonesian Ministry of Health. If symptoms manifest, it may be necessary to do another examination [176]. The goal of DRE is to detect any abnormalities in the perianal region, the lower portion of the rectum, the anal canal, and the area between the rectum and vagina in females. Additionally, it assesses the functionality of the anal sphincter and examines the dimensions, connection, and mobility of any tumors located in the lower two-thirds of the rectum. This examination primarily focuses on the specific characteristics of colorectal cancer, such as the extent of its spread on the rectal wall, its location in respect to vital bodily structures, its mobility, and its metastasis. This information is vital for the purpose of surgical planning [177].\nWhen performing a DRE, health care providers start by inquiring about any rectal symptoms, such as tumors, bleeding, or pain. Next, they thoroughly examine the region surrounding the anus and feel the bottom portion of the rectum as well as the inside of the anal canal. This efficient and cost- effective approach often requires less than one minute and is particularly effective in detecting tumors near the distal end of the rectum [177].\nFOBTs are essential for the early identification of colorectal cancer as they detect occult blood in faces. Presently, there exist three types of FOBTs, distinguished by their methods of blood detection: chemical tests, immuno-chromatography testing, and DNA-based tests [178]. The guaiac-based faecal occult blood test (gFOBT) is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of haemoglobin in stool by assessing its pseudo-peroxidase activity. Although the gFOBT is beneficial, its specificity is relatively low, often requiring further tests for a correct diagnosis of colorectal cancer [179]. The 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) test using a test paper, offers a simpler approach for patients as it undergoes a color change upon reacting with certain components in the stool. While this method is designed to be easy for users, it can only identify blood that is visible on the surface of the faces. This limitation increases the risk of errors in interpretation since it relies on visual assessment [180].\nEndoscopic procedures are essential for screening CRC as they enable direct visualisation of the inner surface of the colon and rectum. Out all these options, colonoscopy is the most comprehensive method, as it involves a direct inspection and is linked to significant reductions in the risk of CRC and mortality rates.\nStudies conducted in Canada and Germany have revealed that following a colonoscopy, there is a 67% reduction in death rates and a 77% decreased risk of acquiring CRC [181]. Colonoscopy negative results were associated with a 56% decreased overall risk of colorectal cancer in the United States, according to a long-term study that followed participants for over 22 years [182]. Although there are differences in the effectiveness of identifying proximal versus distal CRC, depending on things like the operator's expertise, the difficulty of visualizing the condition, and the thoroughness of the inspection. Notwithstanding its advantages, colonoscopy has several disadvantages as well, such as the discomfort of preparing the intestine, the dangers of anesthesia, and the possibility of procedural complications such as bleeding and perforation.

This can lead to better utilization of resources and improved outcomes for patients [192].\nThe application of AI in the clinical field of CRC is facilitated by its capacity to identify patients at high risk, choose accurate and personalized treatment strategies, and forecast prognoses. This demonstrates the present and future therapeutic relevance of AI technologies in the management of CRC [191]. Implementing these methods in clinical practice has the capacity to enhance colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, detection, and management. This can result in earlier detection, decreased burden from screening procedures, and improved outcomes for individuals at risk of CRC.\nAl technology has lately made significant advancements in the diagnosis of CRC. Despite being a long-standing cornerstone of early colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, colonoscopy has faced considerable difficulties in detecting polyps and adenomas due to inconsistencies among operators and inadequate preparation. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems, along with AI techniques such as DL, have been proven to overcome these challenges and improve the adenoma detection rate (ADR) [193].

Researchers in Japan have analyzed extensive video data from laparoscopic colorectal surgeries to enhance the performance of CNN in computer vision [179]. Simultaneously, South Korean research has shown nearly flawless precision in the study of microcirculation. This was achieved by employing AI to develop versatile and very advanced learning models for the examination of indocyanine green (ICG) angiography in laparoscopic surgeries [199].\nAl has had significant growth in the field of robotic surgery, namely in the domain of rectal surgery. The advantages of using a robotic system compared to traditional approaches include a decrease in perioperative problems and an enhancement in postoperative quality of life.

Liver Cancer and \u0391\u0399", "content": "The most prevalent form of primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is one of the leading causes of cancer-related fatalities worldwide. Liver fibrosis can result from chronic inflammation, which in turn creates an environment where profibrogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins accumulate excessively. This leads to a disruption of the liver's structure and function, which is then replaced by immunologically inert matrix. This process can progress to cirrhosis and ultimately liver failure, with the associated morbidity and mortality that make liver transplantation the most common reason for liver replacement [219]. The importance of early identification of HCC is evident due to its direct correlation with enhanced patient outcomes, particularly in persons at high risk, such as those with a previous record of chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection.\nUtilizing non-invasive biomarkers such as AFP, DCP, and GPC3 in conjunction with state-of-the- art imaging techniques such as MRI and ultrasound [220], have revolutionized the early detection landscape, increasing sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of HCC and leading to multi- modality algorithms which are optimum for predicting early tumor recurrence Imaging technology has made considerable advancements in the past decade, and one promising option is contrast- enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The technology offers a clear and detailed view of the liver and its blood vessels in real-time, with high resolution. It also gives enhanced accuracy in detecting HCC and allows for precise measurement of tumor margins during surgery, surpassing the capabilities of standard ultrasound [221].\nFurthermore, in addition to conventional imaging techniques, radiomics features can serve as a supplementary tool to enhance the precision of HCC diagnoses by assisting AI-based algorithms [222]. The von Willebrand factor (vWF) is now a critical prognostic indicator that influences the efficacy of systemic treatment, the progression of conditions after HCC removal, and the risk of HCC in cirrhotic patients. There is a possibility that vWF may affect acute liver failure and non- cirrhotic portal hypertension due to its involvement in the production of portal microthrombi. Non- selective beta-blockers, statins, anticoagulants, and antibiotics that are not ingested by the body are among the medications that have the capacity to regulate vWF levels. [223]. Recent advancements in radiomics models, particularly those utilizing multi-sequence MRI, have demonstrated potential in predicting the expression of PD-1/PD-L1_in HCC). This predictive capability could be valuable in informing decisions on immunotherapy treatment [224]. These are"}, {"title": "5.1 Current Diagnostic Approaches for the Detection of Liver Cancer", "content": "Appropriate screening methods are essential for detecting HCC early on, as this improves patient outcomes. While there is no universally acknowledged screening strategy for HCC, ultrasound has proven to be the most cost-effective and commonly used tool for early diagnosis of HCC, particularly in high-risk categories such patients with cirrhosis [225"}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "CONVENTIONAL power grids have been integral to electricity distribution for decades, serving as the core infrastructure for energy transmission from power plants to end-users [1]. However, the growing electricity demand and increasing integration of renewable energy resources have urged a more advanced and enhanced power grid system. As a result, the smart grid, a sophisticated electrical grid system that incorporates advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), has been introduced to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and reliability of electricity distribution [2].\nThe ICT integration in smart grids enables bidirectional flows of both electricity and information, positioning smart grids as the modern backbone of energy infrastructure [8]. By leveraging ICTs, smart grids facilitate dynamic pricing, effective load management, and improved grid operations, thereby mitigating power outages and enhancing system stability [9] [10]. In addition, intelligent entities such as smart meters and advanced distribution management systems (ADMS) enable demand-side management and substantially reduce the operational and management costs by employing advanced fault detection and automation techniques [2], [11], [12]. Smart grids also facilitate the integration of a diverse range of energy resources. Particularly, the decentralized power generation via distributed energy resources (DERs), reduces transmission losses and improves the energy efficiency [13]. The integration of renewable energy systems like solar panels and wind turbines delivers a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy production [14], [15]. The adoption of vehicle-to-grid technology as well as the development of microgrids offers a reliable energy supply in the event of outages or disasters, further enhancing the grid resilience [16], [17].\nAlthough smart grids offer numerous advantages, the increased connectivity and complexity of smart grids also expose them to various security threats. Smart grids have been identified as potential targets for various attacks, which can exploit vulnerabilities in the ICT infrastructure to disrupt power supply, compromise sensitive data, or inflict physical damage to grid components. For example, the Stuxnet attack, uncovered in 2010, aimed at compromising the industrial control systems to damage the Iranian nuclear facilities [18]. In 2015, attackers penetrated the information systems of energy distribution companies in Ukraine, leading to significant power outages. The Dragonfly 2.0 campaign, identified in 2017 has demonstrated its capability to compromise the security of energy sector network in the United States and Europe [19]. These examples highlight the critical need for adequate security measures to protect the smart grid infrastructure.\nTowards this, multiple strategies have been proposed in smart girds to improve their security. Specifically, smart grids incorporate advanced monitoring and detection techniques to provide real-time alerts and responses to potential attacks [20]. The self-healing mechanisms facilitate quick recovery from attacks and minimize adverse impacts [21]. Data exchange has been protected by encrypted and authenticated communication protocols [11]. Smart grids also foster collaboration among stakeholders through shared threat intelligence and best security practices, enhancing the security of the entire grid infrastructure [22]. While conventional security strategies such as cryptography, authentication, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential to preserve the security of smart grids, they might not be sufficient to defend against the continuously evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. The complicated structure and heterogeneous components of smart grids impose a significant challenge in combating advanced cyber attacks, necessitating innovative and efficient solutions.\nTo defend against evolving attack threats, emerging techniques such as machine learning, blockchain, graph theory, and game theory have been extensively investigated and have proven their capability in understanding and mitigating smart grid security threats. However, these techniques also face substantial challenges. Adversarial machine learning attacks, in particular, pose a considerable threat to machine learning-based strategies, necessitating ongoing research and development to enhance the resilience of smart grid systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have also demonstrated great potential in cybersecurity and attack detection, offering insights into their offensive security capabilities [23].\nIn this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine different network attacks targeting smart grids and investigate emerging mitigation strategies that show potential in better preventing and detecting advanced threats. We carry out a detailed examination of various attack vectors, detection and mitigation strategies, and emerging threats of adversarial machine learning attacks and LLMs, providing a holistic overview of potential security challenges and solutions within the smart grids."}, {"title": "A.

OVERVIEW OF SMART GRID", "content": "In this section, we provide a brief overview of smart grids from perspectives of its structures, components, and protocols."}, {"title": "A. Structure of Smart Grid", "content": "Smart grids can be built on different architectures given their specific operational concentrations, including management, distribution, communication, security, and scalability. For example, microgrid and peer-to-peer architectures focus on electricity generation and distribution, facilitating local energy production and direct energy trading among participants. Meanwhile, hierarchical and cloud-based architectures concentrate on the scalable and centralized energy management, enhancing control and data analytic capabilities across the smart grid cyber infrastructure. On the other hand, zero trust and end-to-end communication architectures aim at preserving security and ensuring secure, efficient data exchange. While each architectural model focuses on specific aspects, a cohesive, layered framework is essential for the design and functionality of smart grids. Santacana et al. [29] propose a four-layer model comprising power conversion/transport/storage/consumption layer, sensor/actuator layer, communication layer, and decision intelligence layer. Another study [30] presents a six-layered framework, namely the physical layer, control layer, data communication layer, network layer, supervisory layer, and management layer. Although various layered frameworks have been proposed, they often cater to specific architectural needs.\nIn this study, we introduce a more generalized framework with three primary layers, each with its own specific sub-layers.

These components can be broadly categorized into three classes: 1) communication, data management and control components; 2) energy generation, storage and efficiency components; 3) security components."}, {"title": "1) Communication, Data Management and Control Components", "content": "These components form the communication backbone and control mechanisms of the smart grid.\n\u2022 Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a pivotal component of smart grids, enabling two-way communication between utilities and customers [31].

Communication Protocols in Samrt Grids", "content": "In smart grids, communication protocols are essential to facilitate efficient data exchange and ensure seamless interaction between various components and devices. DNP3, Modbus, and MQTT are the most prominent communication protocols adopted in smart grids.\n\u2022 Distributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) is widely used in SCADA systems [42]. It supports features such as authentication, encryption, and data integrity to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and control commands.\n\u2022 Modbus is a common communication protocol in industrial control systems and smart grid operations, used for monitoring and controlling devices like intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and RTUs [43].

MQTT offers inherent security features such as transport layer security (TLS) and secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption, which provide secure channels for data transmission. However, its lightweight nature may expose it to potential vulnerabilities such as weak authentication, insecure default settings, and susceptibility to denial of service (DoS) attacks.\nIn the subsequent sections, we will explore various network attacks targeting different layers of smart grids and examine emerging mitigation strategies to defend against these threats."}, {"title": "III. EMERGING ATTACKS IN SMART GRID", "content": "In this section, we focus on understanding various types of attacks that undermine the security of smart grids. While attacks on power grids have been extensively investigated, our interest is primarily in the attacks associated with the newly incorporated smart grid components. Specifically, we categorize these attacks into three main groups: cyber layer attacks, which aim at the cyber infrastructure of smart grids to disrupt operations and compromise data privacy; cyber-physical layer attacks, which target the control and sensor systems in smart grids, potentially causing operational failures and physical consequences; coordinated attacks, which combine cyber and physical tactics to simultaneously attack various grid components, undermining the core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nFor each category, we will discuss different attacks from three security perspectives:\n\u2022 Confidentiality, which involves safeguarding against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of sensitive information.\n\u2022 Integrity, which ensures the accuracy, completeness, and uncorrupted state of data and system components.\n\u2022 Availability, which pertains to the system capability to provide timely access to resources and services when needed."}, {"title": "A. Cyber Layer Attacks", "content": "Cyber layer attacks in smart grids can be defined as unauthorized or malicious activities targeting various components within the cyber layer of smart grids (including network, management, and application sub-layers). These attacks utilize various tactics like malware, phishing, ransomware, and DoS attacks, each with distinct objectives such as breaching sensitive data, exploiting financial gain, or disrupting network functioning. Table II categorizes cyber layer attacks based on malicious objectives that impact the security aspects of confidentiality, integrity, or availability."}, {"title": "1) Confidentiality", "content": "Eavesdropping: The attack (also known as traffic analysis or packet sniffing) refers to the interception and analysis of network traffic to gain sensitive information [45]. In smart grids, eavesdropping may expose critical data to attackers including energy consumption patterns, pricing information, control messages, etc. Encryption and secure communication protocols can help mitigate the risk of eavesdropping in smart grids [46], [47].\nMan-in-the-middle (MITM): These attacks occur when an adversary intercepts communication between two parties, potentially intercepting, modifying, or injecting packets without the original participants' knowledge [48]. In smart grids, a successful MITM attack could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, FDI, or the manipulation of control messages [49]. Defense strategies against MITM attacks include cryptographic-based prevention (e.g., TLS), anomaly mitigation, and anomaly detection [50].\nUnauthorized Access: Such attack aims to grant illegitimate access to critical systems (e.g., control centers, energy management platforms), resulting in the tampering of energy usage data, disruption of grid operations, or breach of customer information in smart grids [51]. One prevalent form of unauthorized access is password pilfering, which steals users' passwords to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems [52]. Preventing unauthorized access in smart grids requires a combination of strong authentication, access control policies, firewalls, and regular security audits [53], [54].\nReconnaissance Attacks: These attacks can either actively scan the network to identify critical infrastructures or passively monitor the network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities of grid's operations, which serve as preliminary steps for more advanced cyber aggression [57]. A specific instance of reconnaissance, known as Modbus Network Scanning, scans the network to identify devices operating with the Modbus protocol, and further launches attacks on the target devices [56]."}, {"title": "2) Integrity", "content": "Supply Chain Attacks: These attacks aim to compromise a smart grid by targeting various stages of a product life cycle (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance) [61]. Particularly, hardware supply chain attacks aim to tamper with or manipulate hardware components during the production or distribution, potentially introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities into smart grid equipments [62]. Also, in 2018, Bloomberg reported that malicious microchips were inserted during the manufacturing process, compromising many companies [63]. On the software side, supply chain attacks focus on compromising the development, distribution, or update processes of software, potentially leading to the installation of malicious code within smart grids. A notable example is the SolarWinds attack in 2020, where attackers embedded a malicious script into the software updates, resulting in breaches of multiple U.S. government agencies and companies [64].\nCommand Manipulation: Such attack aims to alter the control commands in smart grids, potentially leading to inappropriate operations, equipment damage, or service disruptions [65]. A real-world example is Industroyer, a highly sophisticated piece of malware, which was specifically designed to target Ukraine's power grid. In 2016, it successfully manipulated control commands, resulting in a significant power outage [66].\nCode Manipulation: This attack targets the software running on smart grid systems, altering its behavior to introduce vulnerabilities or facilitate unauthorized access [65]. A notable example of code manipulation is the malware Flame (sKy-WIper), which was discovered in 2012. It primarily targeted computer systems in the Middle East, and was intricately designed to manipulate code in order to steal sensitive information and monitor user activities [67].\nMalware Injection: The attack aims to insert malicious software into systems, potentially disrupting their functionality, stealing sensitive information, or facilitating further attacks. A real-world instance of such an attack is the malware known as BlackEnergy, which evolved from a simple DDoS platform to a highly sophisticated, plug-in based malware capable of targeting critical infrastructures. By exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used communication standards, BlackEnergy allows attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, and disrupt essential operations, posing a significant risks to critical systems and infrastructure [68]."}, {"title": "3) Availability", "content": "DOS/DDoS Attacks: These attacks have different operational tactics but share a common objective to overwhelm a target system or network, rendering it unavailable or inaccessible. A DoS attack leverages one device to flood a target with excessive traffic or requests, whereas a DDoS attack coordinates multiple devices (e.g., botnets) to generate the deluge of requests. In smart grids, such attacks may target key components such as control systems or communication networks, potentially leading to significant disruptions in power distribution and management [80]. Mirai botnet is a real-world example of botnet-driven DDoS attacks, where the attacker exploits vulnerable IoT devices to launch large-scale attacks against various internet services [79]. To mitigate these attacks, it is essential to implement robust network security protocols, such as deploying IDSs, or adopting traffic filtering techniques.\nResponse Delay Attack: Such attack directly affects service availability by intentionally increasing the latency in the response of a Modbus device [59]. The resultant delays can disrupt the real-time operation of the system, leading to synchronization issues, incorrect system states, and even unavailability of control responses. For example, if the command to boot power production in response to demand surge is significantly delayed, it could result in power shortages and outages."}, {"title": "Research challenges against cyber-layer attacks", "content": "Though cryptography based authentication, encryption and IDSs can help mitigate many cyber-layer attacks, defending against them presents various challenges due to the complexity and critical nature of the smart grid infrastructure. The diverse range of attack vectors requires the defense strategies to be both comprehensive and highly flexible. As smart grids are interconnected, a cyber-layer attack may not only compromise the integrity of the network, management, and application sub-layers, but also cascade to other layers, resulting in more extensive damage. It is necessary to deploy a suite of security strategies that can work cohesively to provide robust protection across all layers of the smart grids. Also, the continually evolving attacks necessitate ongoing updates and adaptation of security protocols and systems. Further, implementing effective security strategies should consider the potential false positives and the imperative for immediate and rapid response to threats, all while maintaining the grid's operational integrity. These challenges underscore the importance of developing dynamic, resilient, and intelligent security solutions that can mitigate the ever-changing threats to the cyber layer of smart grids."}, {"title": "B. Cyber-physical Layer Attacks", "content": "Cyber-physical layer attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber-physical layers (including control, measurement and sensor sub-layers), directly or indirectly impacting the smart grid's functionality. For example, an attack could disrupt control algorithms leading to equipment dysfunction or electricity misrouting. Alternatively, an attacker could compromise the integrity of sensor data, undermining the grid reliability and resulting in power outages. Table III outlines the classification of cyber-physical attacks based on their malicious objectives."}, {"title": "1) Confidentiality", "content": "Side Channel attacks: These attacks exploit inadvertent information leaks from physical systems to compromise sensitive data. Such attacks usually target devices using cryptographic techniques (e.g., smart meters, PMUs) [85]. Power analysis attacks, for example, infer secret keys by analyzing the power consumption patterns of a device during cryptographic operations [86]. Electromagnetic analysis attacks extract sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys, from electromagnetic emissions of a device [87]. Timing attacks exploit variations in operation times to gain sensitive data [88]. Mitigation strategies such as the adoption of secure hardware designs, and randomization of timing or power consumption patterns can be deployed to defend against such attacks. [89], [90].\nInsider Attacks: Such attacks are perpetrated by insiders who have authorized access to the network and systems within the smart grid. An insider could be an employee, contractor, or even a business partner for their personal gains or malicious intents. They have the sufficient knowledge of the system to bypass the security enforcement, potentially resulting in data theft, system damage, or operational disruption. IDS can be deployed to identify suspicious activities of insider attacks [91]."}, {"title": "2) Integrity", "content": "Switching Manipulation Attacks: In switching manipulation attacks, an adversary aims to manipulate the state of switches (e.g., circuit breakers, transfer switches) to disrupt normal grid operation and cause physical damage [113]\u2013[117]. By modifying the state of switches, the attacker can alter power flows, cause overloads, or even isolate parts of the grid, leading to significant operational challenges and risks [118].\nLoad Redistribution Attacks: In such attacks, an adversary aims to manipulate the control system to alter the distribution of electrical loads across the network [119], [120]. The attacks can be accomplished by falsifying data or dispatching malicious commands to control systems [121]. By redistributing the load inappropriately, the attacker can cause physical equipment to overload and potentially fail, leading to blackouts or other disruptions of service [122].\nAttacks in Vehicle-to-grid (V2G): V2G technologies allow two-way energy exchange between electric vehicles (EVs) and the power grid, enabling EVs to act as distributed energy resources [123]. In the attack scenario, a malicious actor might hack into the control systems of autonomous vehicles or the V2G communication interface to manipulate power flow, spoof charging/discharging commands, or disrupt grid balance by injecting false data [124]. Such attacks could lead to local and wider grid instabilities, causing power quality issues or even blackouts. Moreover, the vehicle's functionality could be compromised, posing safety risks [125].\nAurora: The attack targets the electrical generators of a power grid and aims to de-synchronize the phase of a generator from the power grid (e.g., opening and closing circuit breakers to alter the physical process of the power system). It dynamically accelerates or decelerates the generator, imposing mechanical stress and eventually damaging or destroying the generator. Aurora attack is first discovered by the Idaho National Laboratory in the United States in 2007. It is particularly concerning because it can cause physical damage to critical infrastructure, and potentially lead to widespread power outages [126]-[129].\nAdvanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are a category of prolonged and targeted cyber-attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for an extended period. The primary goal of most APT attacks is to achieve and maintain ongoing access to the targeted network for monitoring activities and breaching sensitive data. STUXNET, uncovered in 2010, is a specific example of APTs capable of causing physical damages to cyber-physical systems. The malicious worm targets the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) within the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of Iran nuclear infrastructure [130]. It exploited vulnerabilities to alter the frequency of the electrical current powering the centrifuges, resulting in physical damage [131]. Havex is another examples of APTS. Developed by the Dragonfly cyber espionage group, Havex is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that exploits vulnerabilities in the energy sector, particularly in the United States and Europe. It has been deployed in attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), with a focus on compromising critical infrastructures [136]\u2013[138]. CrashOverride, also known as Industroyer, is malware employed on attack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 [139], [140]. It is the first malware designed specifically to attack electric grids, which can directly control electricity substation switches and circuit breakers [141]. All these attacks highlight the potentially severe consequences that APTs can have on the interconnected smart grid systems [132]\u2013[134].\nSource ID Mix: Source ID mix is a type of data spoofing attack that targets wide-area measurement systems in smart grids. Instead of altering the actual measurements, source ID mix tampers with the data from PMUs by confusing their source identification tags. Such attacks can compromise the operational reliability of the network, potentially leading to incorrect actions based on faulty data interpretations. To defend against such attacks, a more robust authentication scheme is required to enforce data authenticity and integrity in power systems [144], [145].\nLocation and Time Synchronization Attacks: These attacks are significant threats to smart grid systems, exploiting their reliance on precise timing for crucial operations [92], [93]. For example, GPS Spoofing transmits counterfeit GPS signals to mislead receivers, potentially causing system instability or incorrect operational decisions, especially in the synchronization of PMUs [94]. Similarly, Time Stamp Attacks (TSAs) interfere with precise GPS timing, disrupting functionalities such as transmission line fault detection and event location estimation [95]. To protect against these timing-dependent threats, multi-antenna-based algorithms have been proposed for quick GPS spoofing detection."}, {"title": "Research challenges against cyber-physical layer attacks", "content": "Defending against cyber-physical layer attacks in smart grids presents unique challenges due to their direct impacts on physical infrastructure. Unlike cyber-layer attacks, which primarily target network and application, cyber-physical attacks can cause actual physical damage to grid components. These attacks exploit the control and sensor layers, leading to malfunctions in equipment and mismanagement of electricity flow. Maintaining integrity in grids is particularly challenging because many attacks in this layer specifically aim to compromise this security aspect. The primary goal against such attacks is to maintain grid stability and prevent physical damage, even in the face of sophisticated attacks that aim to disrupt the balance between supply and demand in smart grids. The defense requires not only securing the network from unauthorized access but also ensuring the integrity of control commands and the authenticity of sensor data. This necessitates implementing secure communication protocols, real-time anomaly detection systems, and resilient control strategies that can adapt to and compensate for malicious activities."}, {"title": "C.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "CONVENTIONAL power grids have been integral to electricity distribution for decades, serving as the core infrastructure for energy transmission from power plants to end-users [1]. However, the growing electricity demand and increasing integration of renewable energy resources have urged a more advanced and enhanced power grid system. As a result, the smart grid, a sophisticated electrical grid system that incorporates advanced information and communication technologies (ICT), has been introduced to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and reliability of electricity distribution [2]. The ICT integration in smart grids enables bidirectional flows of both electricity and information, positioning smart grids as the modern backbone of energy infrastructure [8]. By leveraging ICTs, smart grids facilitate dynamic pricing, effective load management, and improved grid operations, thereby mitigating power outages and enhancing system stability [9] [10]. In addition, intelligent entities such as smart meters and advanced distribution management systems (ADMS) enable demand-side management and substantially reduce the operational and management costs by employing advanced fault detection and automation techniques [2], [11], [12]. Smart grids also facilitate the integration of a diverse range of energy resources. Particularly, the decentralized power generation via distributed energy resources (DERs), reduces transmission losses and improves the energy efficiency [13]. The integration of renewable energy systems like solar panels and wind turbines delivers a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy production [14], [15]. The adoption of vehicle-to-grid technology as well as the development of microgrids offers a reliable energy supply in the event of outages or disasters, further enhancing the grid resilience [16], [17]. Although smart grids offer numerous advantages, the increased connectivity and complexity of smart grids also expose them to various security threats. Smart grids have been identified as potential targets for various attacks, which can exploit vulnerabilities in the ICT infrastructure to disrupt power supply, compromise sensitive data, or inflict physical damage to grid components. For example, the Stuxnet attack, uncovered in 2010, aimed at compromising the industrial control systems to damage the Iranian nuclear facilities [18]. In 2015, attackers penetrated the information systems of energy distribution companies in Ukraine, leading to significant power outages. The Dragonfly 2.0 campaign, identified in 2017 has demonstrated its capability to compromise the security of energy sector network in the United States and Europe [19]. These examples highlight the critical need for adequate security measures to protect the smart grid infrastructure. Towards this, multiple strategies have been proposed in smart girds to improve their security. Specifically, smart grids incorporate advanced monitoring and detection techniques to provide real-time alerts and responses to potential attacks [20]. The self-healing mechanisms facilitate quick recovery from attacks and minimize adverse impacts [21]. Data exchange has been protected by encrypted and authenticated communication protocols [11]. Smart grids also foster collaboration among stakeholders through shared threat intelligence and best secu-rity practices, enhancing the security of the entire grid infrastructure [22]. While conventional security strategies such as cryptography, authentication, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential to preserve the security of smart grids, they might not be sufficient to defend against the continuously evolving and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. The complicated structure and heterogeneous components of smart grids impose a significant challenge in combating advanced cyber attacks, necessitating innovative and efficient solutions. To defend against evolving attack threats, emerging techniques such as machine learning, blockchain, graph theory, and game theory have been extensively investigated and have proven their capability in understanding and mitigating smart grid security threats. However, these techniques also face substantial challenges. Adversarial machine learning attacks, in particular, pose a considerable threat to machine learning-based strategies, necessitating ongoing research and development to enhance the resilience of smart grid systems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have also demonstrated great potential in cybersecurity and attack detection, offering insights into their offensive security capabilities [23]. In this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive literature review to examine different network attacks targeting smart grids and investigate emerging mitigation strategies that show potential in better preventing and detecting advanced threats. We carry out a detailed examination of various attack vectors, detection and mitigation strategies, and emerging threats of adversarial machine learning attacks and LLMs, providing a holistic overview of potential security challenges and solutions within the smart grids."}, {"title": "A. Key Contributions", "content": "The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\nWe provide a systematic study of smart grid architecture, by defining and categorizing them to three interconnected layers including the physical, cyber-physical, and cyber layers.

Structure of the Paper", "content": "Our survey provides a comprehensive examination of smart grid security, focusing on its structure, emerging attack vectors, detection and mitigation strategies, and future research directions. Section II lays the foundation by detailing the structure, components, and communication protocols of the smart grid. We partition the system into three interconnected layers: the physical layer, the cyber-physical layer, and the cyber layer. The physical layer includes components related to the generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electric power. The cyber-physical layer integrates the physical layer with sensing, measurement, and control systems, bridging the gap between physical infrastructure and the digital control system. The cyber layer forms the communication and data exchange backbone, encompassing data communication, networking, supervisory, and management. Section III explores emerging attacks in smart grids.

Therefore, a thorough examination of LLMs and adversarial attacks adds a critical dimension to our study. Section VI concludes the paper by summarizing the key findings and emphasizing the importance of continued research and development in smart grid security."}, {"title": "II. OVERVIEW OF SMART GRID", "content": "In this section, we provide a brief overview of smart grids from perspectives of its structures, components, and protocols."}, {"title": "A. Structure of Smart Grid", "content": "Smart grids can be built on different architectures given their specific operational concentrations, including management, distribution, communication, security, and scalability. For example, microgrid and peer-to-peer architectures focus on electricity generation and distribution, facilitating local energy production and direct energy trading among participants. Meanwhile, hierarchical and cloud-based architectures concentrate on the scalable and centralized energy management, enhancing control and data analytic capabilities across the smart grid cyber infrastructure. On the other hand, zero trust and end-to-end communication architectures aim at preserving security and ensuring secure, efficient data exchange. While each architectural model focuses on specific aspects, a cohesive, layered framework is essential for the design and functionality of smart grids. Santacana et al. [29] propose a four-layer model comprising power conversion/transport/storage/consumption layer, sensor/actuator layer, communication layer, and decision intelligence layer. Another study [30] presents a six-layered framework, namely the physical layer, control layer, data communication layer, network layer, supervisory layer, and management layer. Although various layered frameworks have been proposed, they often cater to specific architectural needs. In this study, we introduce a more generalized framework with three primary layers, each with its own specific sub-layers. 1) Physical Layer We define the physical layer as the foundation of the smart grid, covering the generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption of electrical power. The physical layer ensures that electricity is generated and transported efficiently and reliably across the grid to meet the demands of diverse consumers. In our definition, the physical layer includes the following sub-layers:\nGeneration Layer involves the production of electrical energy from various sources, such as fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.\nTransmission Layer is responsible for the high-voltage transportation of electrical power from the generation sources to distribution substations.\nDistribution Layer manages the lower voltage distribution of electricity from substations to consumers, ensuring that electricity reaches the end-users safely and reliably.\nConsumption Layer focuses on the end-users of electricity, including households, industries, and commercial establishments. It encompasses the devices and appliances that utilize electrical energy.\n2) Cyber-Physical Layer We define the cyber-physical layer as the intermediary between the physical and cyber layers, connecting the physical components of the smart grid with their digital counterparts. This layer is essential for monitoring, control, and optimization of the smart grid performance. In our definition, the sub-layers within the cyber-physical layer include:\nControl Layer facilitates real-time control of the smart grid components. It employs control algorithms in automation devices and deploys communication protocols directed through routers, switches, and gateways. This layer ensures that the grid functions optimally and adapts to changes in demand, effectively regulating the performance of the smart grid.\nMeasurement and Sensor Layer is integral to the collection and processing of data from various sensors and meters installed across the grid. These sensors provide crucial information on the performance and status of the grid components, enabling the control layer to make informed decisions and adjustments.\n3) Cyber Layer We define the cyber layer as the digital backbone of the smart grid, responsible for the communication, data processing, and management of the grid operations. This layer facilitates the seamless exchange of information and control signals between various grid components, enabling efficient and coordinated operations. In our definition, the sub-layers within the cyber layer include:\nNetwork Layer forms the essential communication infrastructure, ensuring seamless data transmission and exchange among various components of the smart grid. This layer is integral to data flow management and plays a key role in maintaining data integrity and security. It harnesses a variety of modern wireless and wired communication technologies, integrating them to establish a robust and resilient network that forms the backbone of the smart grid communication system.\nManagement Layer focuses on the supervision and management of smart grid operations to ensure effective and efficient functioning. The management layer is integral for data processing, monitoring, diagnostics, and decision-making processes to ensure the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of smart grids.\nApplication Layer is concerned with the specific applications and services built on top of the smart grid infrastructure. It involves various software applications and user interfaces that are designed to enhance the overall efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the energy sector."}, {"title": "B. Components in Smart Grid", "content": "In smart grids, various components work together to ensure efficient functioning and management of modern power systems. These components can be broadly categorized into three classes: 1) communication, data management and control components; 2) energy generation, storage and efficiency components; 3) security components. 1) Communication, Data Management and Control Components These components form the communication backbone and control mechanisms of the smart grid.\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a pivotal component of smart grids, enabling two-way communication between utilities and customers [31]. AMI facilitates the collection and analysis of energy usage data, supporting demand response and energy management.\nDistribution Management Systems (DMS) streamline the management of distribution networks, enhancing efficiency and reliability [32]. DMS integrates various functions such as fault location, isolation, and service restoration, improving overall operational performance.\nDistribution Automation (DA) systems optimize the operation of distribution networks using advanced sensors, communication technologies, and control devices [33]. DA systems enable real-time monitoring and control of the distribution network.\nPhasor Measurement Units (PMUs) provide real-time monitoring of power systems, measuring voltage, current, and frequency at high resolutions [34]. PMUs enhance the ability to detect and respond to grid disturbances, improving system stability and reliability.\nRemote Terminal Units (RTUs) collect data from field sensors, convert it to digital form, and transmit it to the central system [35]. They also receive and execute control commands, enabling remote monitoring and control of grid components.\nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems monitor and control critical infrastructure in the power grid, providing real-time data on system states [36]. SCADA systems enable operators to make informed decisions and take timely actions to maintain grid stability and security.\nWide Area Monitoring Systems (WAMS) monitor power systems over large geographical areas, offering real-time data on stability and performance [37]. WAMS helps in the early detection of potential grid issues, allowing for proactive measures to prevent large-scale outages.\n2) Energy Generation, Storage, and Efficiency Components These components are integral to energy production, storage, and management of energy demand.\nMicrogrids are small-scale power grids that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid, improving resilience and energy efficiency [38].\nDistributed Energy Resources (DERs) include renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines, which contribute to a sustainable and diverse energy mix [39].\nEnergy Storage Systems (ESS) help balance supply and demand by storing excess energy and releasing it during peak demand periods [40].\nDemand Response (DR) programs allow utilities to adjust energy consumption during peak demand periods to alleviate grid stress [41].\n3) Security Components These components establish critical defenses to secure the grid from cyber threats and unauthorized access.\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) actively monitor and identify suspicious activities, protecting the grid from potential cyber attacks.\nFirewalls establish a barrier between the trusted internal network of the smart grid and potential threats from outside networks. While the integration of new components such as AMI, PMU, and SCADA indeed enhances the efficiency and reliability of smart grids, it also brings new security challenges. This is because these components rely on ICT infrastructure, making them vulnerable to potential cyber attacks."}, {"title": "C. Communication Protocols in Samrt Grids", "content": "In smart grids, communication protocols are essential to facilitate efficient data exchange and ensure seamless interaction between various components and devices. DNP3, Modbus, and MQTT are the most prominent communication protocols adopted in smart grids.\nDistributed Network Protocol 3 (DNP3) is widely used in SCADA systems [42]. It supports features such as authentication, encryption, and data integrity to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and control commands.\nModbus is a common communication protocol in industrial control systems and smart grid operations, used for monitoring and controlling devices like intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and RTUs [43]. Due to its age and simplicity, Modbus lacks robust security features such as authentication, encryption, and data integrity mechanisms, leaving the smart grid vulnerable to cyber attacks.\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for low-bandwidth and high-latency networks [44]. MQTT offers inherent security features such as transport layer security (TLS) and secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption, which provide secure channels for data transmission. However, its lightweight nature may expose it to potential vulnerabilities such as weak authentication, insecure default settings, and susceptibility to denial of service (DoS) attacks. In the subsequent sections, we will explore various network attacks targeting different layers of smart grids and examine emerging mitigation strategies to defend against these threats."}, {"title": "III. EMERGING ATTACKS IN SMART GRID", "content": "In this section, we focus on understanding various types of attacks that undermine the security of smart grids. While attacks on power grids have been extensively investigated, our interest is primarily in the attacks associated with the newly incorporated smart grid components. Specifically, we categorize these attacks into three main groups: cyber layer attacks, which aim at the cyber infrastructure of smart grids to disrupt operations and compromise data privacy; cyber-physical layer attacks, which target the control and sensor systems in smart grids, potentially causing operational failures and physical consequences; coordinated attacks, which combine cyber and physical tactics to simultaneously attack various grid components, undermining the core security principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For each category, we will discuss different attacks from three security perspectives:\nConfidentiality, which involves safeguarding against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of sensitive information.\nIntegrity, which ensures the accuracy, completeness, and uncorrupted state of data and system components.\nAvailability, which pertains to the system capability to provide timely access to resources and services when needed."}, {"title": "A. Cyber Layer Attacks", "content": "Cyber layer attacks in smart grids can be defined as unauthorized or malicious activities targeting various components within the cyber layer of smart grids (including network, management, and application sub-layers). These attacks utilize various tactics like malware, phishing, ransomware, and DoS attacks, each with distinct objectives such as breaching sensitive data, exploiting financial gain, or disrupting network functioning. Table II categorizes cyber layer attacks based on malicious objectives that impact the security aspects of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.\n1) Confidentiality Eavesdropping: The attack (also known as traffic analysis or packet sniffing) refers to the interception and analysis of network traffic to gain sensitive information [45]. In smart grids, eavesdropping may expose critical data to attackers including energy consumption patterns, pricing information, control messages, etc. Encryption and secure communication protocols can help mitigate the risk of eavesdropping in smart grids [46], [47]. Man-in-the-middle (MITM): These attacks occur when an adversary intercepts communication between two parties, potentially intercepting, modifying, or injecting packets without the original participants' knowledge [48]. In smart grids, a successful MITM attack could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, FDI, or the manipulation of control messages [49]. Defense strategies against MITM attacks include cryptographic-based prevention (e.g., TLS), anomaly mitigation, and anomaly detection [50]. Unauthorized Access: Such attack aims to grant illegitimate access to critical systems (e.g., control centers, energy management platforms), resulting in the tampering of energy usage data, disruption of grid operations, or breach of customer information in smart grids [51]. One prevalent form of unauthorized access is password pilfering, which steals users' passwords to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems [52]. Preventing unauthorized access in smart grids requires a combination of strong authentication, access control policies, firewalls, and regular security audits [53], [54]. Reconnaissance Attacks: These attacks can either actively scan the network to identify critical infrastructures or passively monitor the network traffic to identify potential vulnerabilities of grid's operations, which serve as preliminary steps for more advanced cyber aggression [57]. A specific instance of reconnaissance, known as Modbus Network Scanning, scans the network to identify devices operating with the Modbus protocol, and further launches attacks on the target devices [56]. Message Replay: Such attack, also known as a replay attack, is a type of cyber-attack where an attacker intercepts and retransmits a valid data transmission, often with malicious intent. One such example in smart grids is the baseline response replay attack, where the attacker captures legitimate responses from a Modbus device, and then replays these responses at a later time to either mislead the system or conceal malicious activities [58]-[60]. Such attacks can lead to incorrect system states being reported, potentially leading to misguided operational decisions or hidden malicious activities. Replay attacks can be mitigated by using various security measures such as time-stamping, sequence numbering, or cryptographic techniques like nonce or digital signatures [45].\n2) Integrity Supply Chain Attacks: These attacks aim to compromise a smart grid by targeting various stages of a product life cycle (e.g., manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance) [61]. Particularly, hardware supply chain attacks aim to tamper with or manipulate hardware components during the production or distribution, potentially introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities into smart grid equipments [62]. Also, in 2018, Bloomberg reported that malicious microchips were inserted during the manufacturing process, compromising many companies [63]. On the software side, supply chain attacks focus on compromising the development, distribution, or update processes of software, potentially leading to the installation of malicious code within smart grids. A notable example is the SolarWinds attack in 2020, where attackers embedded a malicious script into the software updates, resulting in breaches of multiple U.S. government agencies and companies [64]. Command Manipulation: Such attack aims to alter the control commands in smart grids, potentially leading to inappropriate operations, equipment damage, or service disruptions [65]. A real-world example is Industroyer, a highly sophisticated piece of malware, which was specifically designed to target Ukraine's power grid. In 2016, it successfully manipulated control commands, resulting in a significant power outage [66]. Code Manipulation: This attack targets the software running on smart grid systems, altering its behavior to introduce vulnerabilities or facilitate unauthorized access [65]. A notable example of code manipulation is the malware Flame (sKy-WIper), which was discovered in 2012. It primarily targeted computer systems in the Middle East, and was intricately designed to manipulate code in order to steal sensitive information and monitor user activities [67]. Malware Injection: The attack aims to insert malicious software into systems, potentially disrupting their functionality, stealing sensitive information, or facilitating further attacks. A real-world instance of such an attack is the malware known as BlackEnergy, which evolved from a simple DDoS platform to a highly sophisticated, plug-in based malware capable of targeting critical infrastructures. By exploiting vulnerabilities in widely-used communication standards, BlackEnergy allows attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, and disrupt essential operations, posing a significant risks to critical systems and infrastructure [68]. Rogue Node: Such attack aims to intercept, modify, or inject false data, commands, or messages, directly causing security breaches and system instability of smart grids [69]. Such attacks can be mitigated by incorporating robust authentication mechanisms that prevent unauthorized users from accessing system assets [70], [71]. Broadcast Message Spoofing: The attack specifically targets smart grids using the Modbus protocol, where an attacker forges a broadcast message that appears to originate from a legitimate source, potentially distributing incorrect commands across the grid [58]. The objective of the attack is to deceive the system into acting on fraudulent commands, emphasizing the critical importance of secure and verifiable communication within the smart grid infrastructure. Topology Attacks: These attacks target the structure and configuration of a network to disrupt the information flow between its components and nodes [72], [73]. Such attacks provide false or misleading data of the grid topology (e.g., fake routing tables or configuration files) to control systems, potentially disrupting the communication in smart grids. Sybil: The attack occurs when a malicious node in a network illegitimately claims multiple identities [74], [75]. By controlling a large number of identities, a Sybil attack can disproportionately impact the network operations, manipulate data aggregation, disrupt communication, or undermine trust-based schemes [76]. Such attack is particularly threatening to distributed systems (e.g., wireless sensor networks in smart grids), where nodes often rely on information from other nodes to make decisions or perform tasks. Byzantine: This attack occurs in distributed systems when one or more nodes behave maliciously or unpredictably, undermining the system reliability [77]. As smart grids rely on distributed control systems, malicious nodes can disseminate conflicting information to various parts of the system, leading to inaccurate data aggregation, communication disruption, or incorrect system decisions [78].\n3) Availability DoS/DDoS Attacks: These attacks have different operational tactics but share a common objective to overwhelm a target system or network, rendering it unavailable or inaccessible. A DoS attack leverages one device to flood a target with excessive traffic or requests, whereas a DDoS attack coordinates multiple devices (e.g., botnets) to generate the deluge of requests. In smart grids, such attacks may target key components such as control systems or communication networks, potentially leading to significant disruptions in power distribution and management [80]. Mirai botnet is a real-world example of botnet-driven DDoS attacks, where the attacker exploits vulnerable IoT devices to launch large-scale attacks against various internet services [79]. To mitigate these attacks, it is essential to implement robust network security protocols, such as deploying IDSs, or adopting traffic filtering techniques. Response Delay Attack: Such attack directly affects service availability by intentionally increasing the latency in the response of a Modbus device [59]. The resultant delays can disrupt the real-time operation of the system, leading to synchronization issues, incorrect system states, and even unavailability of control responses. For example, if the command to boot power production in response to demand surge is significantly delayed, it could result in power shortages and outages. Research challenges against cyber-layer attacks: Though cryptography based authentication, encryption and IDSs can help mitigate many cyber-layer attacks, defending against them presents various challenges due to the complexity and critical nature of the smart grid infrastructure. The diverse range of attack vectors requires the defense strategies to be both comprehensive and highly flexible. As smart grids are interconnected, a cyber-layer attack may not only compromise the integrity of the network, management, and application sub-layers, but also cascade to other layers, resulting in more extensive damage. It is necessary to deploy a suite of security strategies that can work cohesively to provide robust protection across all layers of the smart grids. Also, the continually evolving attacks necessitate ongoing updates and adaptation of security protocols and systems. Further, implementing effective security strategies should consider the potential false positives and the imperative for immediate and rapid response to threats, all while maintaining the grid's operational integrity. These challenges underscore the importance of developing dynamic, resilient, and intelligent security solutions that can mitigate the ever-changing threats to the cyber layer of smart grids."}, {"title": "B. Cyber-physical Layer Attacks", "content": "Cyber-physical layer attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber-physical layers (including control, measurement and sensor sub-layers), directly or indirectly impacting the smart grid's functionality. For example, an attack could disrupt control algorithms leading to equipment dysfunction or electricity misrouting. Alternatively, an attacker could compromise the integrity of sensor data, undermining the grid reliability and resulting in power outages. Table III outlines the classification of cyber-physical attacks based on their malicious objectives.\n1) Confidentiality Side Channel attacks: These attacks exploit inadvertent information leaks from physical systems to compromise sensitive data. Such attacks usually target devices using cryptographic techniques (e.g., smart meters, PMUs) [85]. Power analysis attacks, for example, infer secret keys by analyzing the power consumption patterns of a device during cryptographic operations [86]. Electromagnetic analysis attacks extract sensitive information, such as cryptographic keys, from electromagnetic emissions of a device [87]. Timing attacks exploit variations in operation times to gain sensitive data [88]. Mitigation strategies such as the adoption of secure hardware designs, and randomization of timing or power consumption patterns can be deployed to defend against such attacks. [89], [90]. Insider Attacks: Such attacks are perpetrated by insiders who have authorized access to the network and systems within the smart grid. An insider could be an employee, contractor, or even a business partner for their personal gains or malicious intents. They have the sufficient knowledge of the system to bypass the security enforcement, potentially resulting in data theft, system damage, or operational disruption. IDS can be deployed to identify suspicious activities of insider attacks [91].\n2) Integrity Switching Manipulation Attacks: In switching manipulation attacks, an adversary aims to manipulate the state of switches (e.g., circuit breakers, transfer switches) to disrupt normal grid operation and cause physical damage [113]\u2013[117]. By modifying the state of switches, the attacker can alter power flows, cause overloads, or even isolate parts of the grid, leading to significant operational challenges and risks [118]. Load Redistribution Attacks: In such attacks, an adversary aims to manipulate the control system to alter the distribution of electrical loads across the network [119], [120]. The attacks can be accomplished by falsifying data or dispatching malicious commands to control systems [121]. By redistributing the load inappropriately, the attacker can cause physical equipment to overload and potentially fail, leading to blackouts or other disruptions of service [122]. Attacks in Vehicle-to-grid (V2G): V2G technologies allow two-way energy exchange between electric vehicles (EVs) and the power grid, enabling EVs to act as distributed energy resources [123]. In the attack scenario, a malicious actor might hack into the control systems of autonomous vehicles or the V2G communication interface to manipulate power flow, spoof charging/discharging commands, or disrupt grid balance by injecting false data [124]. Such attacks could lead to local and wider grid instabilities, causing power quality issues or even blackouts. Moreover, the vehicle's functionality could be compromised, posing safety risks [125]. Aurora: The attack targets the electrical generators of a power grid and aims to de-synchronize the phase of a generator from the power grid (e.g., opening and closing circuit breakers to alter the physical process of the power system). It dynamically accelerates or decelerates the generator, imposing mechanical stress and eventually damaging or destroying the generator. Aurora attack is first discovered by the Idaho National Laboratory in the United States in 2007. It is particularly concerning because it can cause physical damage to critical infrastructure, and potentially lead to widespread power outages [126]-[129]. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs): APTs are a category of prolonged and targeted cyber-attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to a network and remain undetected for an extended period. The primary goal of most APT attacks is to achieve and maintain ongoing access to the targeted network for monitoring activities and breaching sensitive data. STUXNET, uncovered in 2010, is a specific example of APTs capable of causing physical damages to cyber-physical systems. The malicious worm targets the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) within the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system of Iran nuclear infrastructure [130]. It exploited vulnerabilities to alter the frequency of the electrical current powering the centrifuges, resulting in physical damage [131]. Havex is another examples of APTS. Developed by the Dragonfly cyber espionage group, Havex is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that exploits vulnerabilities in the energy sector, particularly in the United States and Europe. It has been deployed in attacks on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), with a focus on compromising critical infrastructures [136]-[138]. CrashOverride, also known as Industroyer, is malware employed on attack on the Ukrainian power grid in 2016 [139], [140]. It is the first malware designed specifically to attack electric grids, which can directly control electricity substation switches and circuit breakers [141]. All these attacks highlight the potentially severe consequences that APTs can have on the interconnected smart grid systems [132]\u2013[134]. Source ID Mix: Source ID mix is a type of data spoofing attack that targets wide-area measurement systems in smart grids. Instead of altering the actual measurements, source ID mix tampers with the data from PMUs by confusing their source identification tags. Such attacks can compromise the operational reliability of the network, potentially leading to incorrect actions based on faulty data interpretations. To defend against such attacks, a more robust authentication scheme is required to enforce data authenticity and integrity in power systems [144], [145]. Location and Time Synchronization Attacks: These attacks are significant threats to smart grid systems, exploiting their reliance on precise timing for crucial operations [92], [93]. For example, GPS Spoofing transmits counterfeit GPS signals to mislead receivers, potentially causing system instability or incorrect operational decisions, especially in the synchronization of PMUs [94]. Similarly, Time Stamp Attacks (TSAs) interfere with precise GPS timing, disrupting functionalities such as transmission line fault detection and event location estimation [95]. To protect against these timing-dependent threats, multi-antenna-based algorithms have been proposed for quick GPS spoofing detection.\nFalse Data Injection (FDI): These attacks, which rank among the most prevalent attacks in the smart grid, aim to disrupt system operations by injecting false data [96]. Such attacks can mislead automated systems and operators by introducing erroneous data into PMUs, leading to incorrect operational decisions. State estimators and converters are particularly vulnerable to FDI attacks, which can result in inaccurate grid state estimates, inappropriate power distribution decisions, and potential disruptions or inefficiencies [97]\u2013[99], [150]. FDI attacks can also compromise protection systems designed to detect and isolate grid faults. If such systems are compromised, their ability to accurately detect faults may be impaired, potentially leading to prolonged outages or equipment damage [100]. Additionally, during load balancing, attackers may introduce false data about the load on different grid parts, causing flawed power distribution decisions and possibly resulting in overloads or underloads in certain areas [101]. A variation of the FDI attack is the blind FDI attack, where the adversary injects false data without comprehensive system knowledge. Blind FDI attackers can still cause significant disruption despite their limited system understanding [102]. Attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC): Attacks on AGC pose significant risks to the stability and reliability of smart grids. The AGC system maintains a real-time balance between generation and load by continually adjusting power output from various generators. If an attacker manages to manipulate the AGC, they can induce frequency instability, overloading or underloading of generators, or even cause blackouts. This could be achieved by injecting false data, tampering with command signals, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication network [103], [104]. Attacks on Voltage Control: In such attacks, adversaries manipulate control systems to alter voltage levels within the grid. They can be achieved by providing false data or sending malicious commands to voltage control devices. Such attacks are particularly concerning because it can lead to physical damage and cascading failures in the power system due to voltage instability [105]. Demand Side Management Attacks: Demand Side Management Attacks, such as Pricing Attacks, aim to manipulate the pricing signals for customers in a demand response system. In pricing attacks, an attacker could falsify price signals to make electricity seem more expensive or cheaper than it actually is. This could lead customers to adjust their energy usage based on false information, leading to instability of grid, financial losses, or even physical damage due to unexpected load changes [111], [112]. Rogue Interloper Attacks: A Rogue Interloper attack on smart grids occurs when an unauthorized device or entity infiltrates the network. The rogue device, through identity spoofing or other forms of deception, presents itself as a legitimate component within the smart grid network. Once accepted as part of the system, it can engage in various malicious activities, such as sending false data or commands, disrupting network communication, or even assuming control over certain operations. The potential consequences of such an attack are significant, leading to operational disruptions or even physical damage to equipment. This highlights the necessity of robust device authentication and stringent access control measures within smart grid networks [146], [147]. 3) Availability Puppet Attacks: In puppet attacks, an attacker gains control of a legitimate node within a network and uses it to carry out malicious activities. The attacker can manipulate the device to send false data, execute unauthorized commands, or disrupt normal operations. Such attacks can indirectly affect the functionality of the smart grid, for instance, by exhausting the bandwidth needed for the control algorithms to function correctly, leading to equipment malfunction or electricity misrouting. Additionally, they can compromise the network operation, potentially resulting in power outages or damage to physical infrastructure [148]. Research challenges against cyber-physical layer attacks: Defending against cyber-physical layer attacks in smart grids presents unique challenges due to their direct impacts on physical infrastructure. Unlike cyber-layer attacks, which primarily target network and application, cyber-physical attacks can cause actual physical damage to grid components. These attacks exploit the control and sensor layers, leading to malfunctions in equipment and mismanagement of electricity flow. Maintaining integrity in grids is particularly challenging because many attacks in this layer specifically aim to compromise this security aspect. The primary goal against such attacks is to maintain grid stability and prevent physical damage, even in the face of sophisticated attacks that aim to disrupt the balance between supply and demand in smart grids. The defense requires not only securing the network from unauthorized access but also ensuring the integrity of control commands and the authenticity of sensor data. This necessitates implementing secure communication protocols, real-time anomaly detection systems, and resilient control strategies that can adapt to and compensate for malicious activities."}, {"title": "C. Coordinated (hybrid) Attacks", "content": "Coordinated attacks utilize a mix of cyber and cyber-physical attack methods to conduct simultaneous or sequential strikes on multiple components within the smart grid [151]. These attacks can involve complex strategies, such as launching a cyber attack to disrupt communication systems followed by a physical attack on critical infrastructure, or vice versa. Despite their complexity, coordinated attacks are highly effective and difficult to detect because they leverage covert masking tactics to compromise multiple security objectives simultaneously. These tactics can include blending malicious actions with legitimate operations to avoid detection and exploiting timing and sequencing to maximize impact. Coordinated attacks typically compromise multiple aspects of security. Table IV outlines various types of coordinated attacks, classifying them based on directly compromised security aspects. Coordinated Topology Attacks: These attacks compromise smart grid operations by manipulating both the physical and cyber components of the system simultaneously. They manipulate state and topology data to mislead control center about line outages and can result in cascading failures within the grid. The attack strategy includes several steps: First, attackers gather detailed topology information and system state data. Next, they physically trip a transmission line to create a real outage and use false data injection to hide the outage of the tripped line. Finally, the attackers generate a fake outage signal for another line, misleading the control center into rerouting power improperly, which can potentially overload critical lines. By carefully coordinating these actions, attackers make it difficult for operators to distinguish between real and fake outages, leading to incorrect operational decisions and increased grid vulnerability [156]. Coordinated Data Injection Attacks: The primary goal of these attacks is to mislead the energy management system by injecting data that resembles normal grid operations, resulting in incorrect control decisions and potential large-scale power outages. These cooperative attackers exploit their knowledge of the power network topology and collaborate to inject false data that appears normal to avoid traditional detection mechanisms in smart girds. Quickest Detection has been proposed to promptly detect and mitigate such coordinated false data injections before they can cause significant damage to the power grid infrastructure [152]. Coordinated Load Changing Attacks: Such attacks aim to coordinate botnets (i.e., a large number of infected IoT devices) to create sudden spikes or drops in energy usage, disrupting the balance between power supply and demand in a smart grid [153]. Typically, the attackers can manipulate the infected IoT devices to simultaneously turn high-wattage appliances on or off, creating the spikes or drops. The rapid changes can destabilize the power grid, leading to automatic load shedding and potentially causing widespread power outages [154]. Coordinated Replay Attacks: These attacks aim to mask the effects of physical attacks on the power grid by replaying recorded normal meter measurements to control centers. To be effective, coordinated replay attacks generally require compromising a large number of branch meters, ensuring the false data appears consistent and avoids detection. An optimized approach to such attacks can evade bad data detection systems by strategically altering only four meter measurements, making them more stealthy and efficient [155]. Recent strategies to defend against such attacks focuses on developing multilevel programming models to enhance the interaction representation between the control center and adversaries, thereby improving the detection of overloaded transmission lines [164]. Line Outage Masking attacks: The objective of these attacks is to mislead the control center into believing that the grid is operating normally, despite one or more transmission lines being out of service [160], [162]. These attacks pose a significant threat to the stability and security of smart grids, leading to severe operational risks and widespread power outages [161]. To hide the line disruptions, attackers can exploit RTUs and PMUs through malicious circuit breaker manipulation and DDoS attacks, erasing the master boot record and overwhelming call centers [158], [163], [164]. Continuous monitoring and quick detection are critical to mitigate the risks posed by Line Outage Masking attacks and to maintain the integrity and reliability of the power grid [165]\u2013[167]. Coordinated DoS Attacks: These attacks target both physical infrastructure and SCADA systems, resulting in severe consequences. The strategy generally begins with an initial physical disruption, such as tampering with power flow meters, followed by DoS attacks to disrupt communication channels between SCADA systems and their sensors or control devices. Such coordination masks the disruption by making critical measurement data unavailable, preventing system operators from detecting the initial damage. Consequently, it leads to incorrect operational decisions and a cascade of failures, significantly impeding the grid's ability to respond effectively [151]. Research challenges against coordinated attacks: It is crucial to develop sophisticated detection mechanisms to defend against coordinated attacks in smart grids. One strategy is the use of Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS), which integrate IDS across different nodes to provide comprehensive monitoring and a unified response strategy [168]. Similarly, the Coordinated Attack Response and Detection System (CARDS) employs a signature-based model for efficient data collection, analysis, and multi-source information correlation [169]. Additionally, [152] improves detection solutions by understanding attacker-defender dynamics, designing distributed detection algorithms, and evaluating the trade-offs between detection speed and reliability. Coordinated attacks can also be identified by analyzing cross-domain attack information [170]. [171] proposes a tri-level optimization model to defend against coordinated attacks by strategically distributing defensive resources on both the physical and cyber components of the smart grid. Despite advanced defense mechanisms, addressing coordinated attacks on smart grids remains a significant challenge. First, the complex nature of these attacks, targeting physical, cyber, and cyber-physical layers simultaneously, complicates the development of comprehensive defense strategies. Detecting and mitigating such attacks requires advanced monitoring systems capable of identifying and correlating anomalies across different layers of the grid infrastructure. Second, it is important to ensure scalability of defense strategies for large-scale smart grids, demanding real-time data processing and efficient algorithms. Furthermore, continuous improvement in threat intelligence and information sharing among smart grid operators is essential to defend against emerging coordinated attack strategies. Finally, integrating advanced technologies, such as machine learning, into security frameworks presents both opportunities and challenges. While these technologies can improve detection and response capabilities, they also introduce new vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to ensure robust defense mechanisms."}, {"title": "IV. DETECTION AND MITIGATION", "content": "In this section, we explore innovative approaches to detect and mitigate different network attacks in smart grids. Specifically, we examine the application of four advanced techniques: game theory, graph theory, blockchain, and machine learning. These techniques have demonstrated effectiveness and prevalence in contemporary research. Each technique offers unique advantages game theory models the adversarial dynamics, graph-based techniques leverage the networked nature of grids, blockchain provides an immutable audit trail, and machine learning enables adaptable and predictive defenses."}, {"title": "A. Game Theory-based Techniques", "content": "Game theory studies how participants make decisions in strategic situations where the outcome for each depends on the actions of others. It can be used to develop strong security measures in smart grids by modeling the complex interactions between different entities, such as utility providers, customers, and potential attackers, and analyzing the various threats and vulnerabilities involved [186]. This enables the development of robust security strategies that account for the various players' incentives and potential actions. Game theory has multiple applications in network intrusion detection for smart grids [187]. [177] proposes a 2-player zero-sum stochastic security game to model interactions between malicious attackers and an IDS. The authors in [172] develop a decision-making and control algorithms via a game-theoretic framework. They proposed a distributed IDS model and two game-theoretic schemes: a security warning system for real-time network security overviews and a finite game between the attacker and IDS, with analytical solutions for Nash equilibrium in the security game. Nash equilibrium is a key concept in game theory, where each participant's strategy is optimal given the strategies of all others. This principle ensures defense strategies are stable and resilient. Nash equilibrium can also introduce mixed strategies, where players randomly choose among multiple actions with certain probabilities, introducing unpredictability that complicates attack strategy of adversaries [188]. Game theory also offers adaptive defensive approaches against dynamic smart grid threats (e.g., APTs) [189], [190]. One typical example is defensive deception, which misleads attackers by manipulating their perceptions and beliefs to protect systems and data [191]. Further, differential game models can be applied to dynamic defense processes and trust frameworks for identifying vulnerabilities. The approach significantly enhances APT attack detection's accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Additionally, game theory is useful in modeling attacks and defenses within smart grids, addressing challenges like data injection attacks [173], energy theft in AMI [174], [192], and cyber threats in the electricity market [175]. Moreover, game theory is important in maintaining global network optimization, especially in FDI attacks on networked microgrids [176]. Another study presents new game-theoretic approaches for corrupted sensor data detection [193]. It formulates the problem as a zero-sum game with partial information, where the detector aims to minimize the estimation error and the attacker maximizes it, with the goal to develop efficient solutions for optimal detectors. Table V summarizes the game theory methods used, the types of attacks detected or mitigated, and the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Research challenge of game theory applications in smart grid security: Ensuring the practical implementation and scalability of game-theoretic solutions in real-world smart grids poses several challenges. One major challenge is accurately modeling the complex interactions between various entities, such as utility providers, customers, and attackers, while considering their diverse objectives and strategies. Additionally, developing realistic threat models that account for the dynamic and evolving nature of cyber threats is difficult. Game theory relies heavily on the assumption of rational behavior, often not reflecting real-world events, resulting in a gap between theory and practice. Another challenge is the computational complexity of finding Nash equilibria and optimal strategies within the resource constraints of smart grid devices [188]. Scalability issues also increase as smart grids expand, challenging the application of game theory in large-scale smart grid networks [194]. Moreover, designing robust game-theoretic models that can effectively manage errors and adapt to unpredictable player behaviors is essential for practical and reliable implementation in smart grid systems [186]."}, {"title": "B. Graph-based Techniques", "content": "Graph theory is the study of mathematical structures that model pairwise interactions between objects, with vertices (nodes) connected by edges (lines) [206]. Multiple graph-based methods have been developed to defend against network threats in smart grids [195], [207]\u2013[210]. Recent studies further extend beyond traditional graph theory, incorporating graph neural networks to enhance attack detection and mitigation strategies. These techniques leverage the principles of graph theory to uncover hidden structures and irregularities within data, facilitating efficient attack detection across various domains such as network security, power systems, and fraud prevention [195], [197], [198], [207]\u2013[215]. Graph-based algorithms have shown their potential for intrusion detection in smart grids. For example, the GrIDS network transforms network activities into event graphs for suspicious activity detection. Similarly, the Local Deviation Coefficient Graph-Based (LDCGB) algorithm improves data labeling and clustering, enhancing discrimination between normal and anomalous data [195]. Graph-based algorithms can also be applied to fraud prevention [215], analyzing connectivity patterns in communication networks to detect potential fraudulent activities, including energy theft, billing fraud, and FDI attacks. Additionally, graph-based methods have been explored for network hardening, helping to extract efficient flow paths and identify potential vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit [196]. Case studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based methods in addressing false data injection in smart grids by utilizing Laplacian matrices and Graph Fourier Transforms (GFT) [197], [198]. Further, graph theory-based methods have been used to test the network vulnerability of lateral movements and privilege escalation attacks, preventing potential APTs [199]. Table VI summarizes the graph theory methods against different attacks in smart grids. Research challenges of graph-based techniques in smart grid security: Graph-based techniques in smart grid security face several research challenges. One major challenge is the scalability of these methods. As the size of smart grids increases, the amount of data grows exponentially, making it difficult to design a big data-driven, meaningful, and valid graph for real-time data processing and analysis [216], [217]. Another challenge is the accuracy of anomaly detection. The detection accuracy of graph-based methods may significantly decrease due to noisy and sparse datasets [218], [219]. These methods must effectively distinguish between normal operational variations and actual security threats to minimize false positives and false negatives. Additionally, it also poses technical and compatibility issues when incorporating graph-based techniques with existing smart grid infrastructure and communication protocols. Moreover, the dynamic nature of smart grids, with constantly changing topologies and new devices being added, requires adaptive and robust graph-based models that can evolve with the system [200], [217]. Finally, it is critical to protect the privacy and security of the data used in graph-based methods, as these techniques rely on extensive data collection and analysis, raising concerns about potential data breaches and misuse."}, {"title": "C. BlockChain", "content": "Blockchain technology is a database system that allows for transparent information sharing over a network by organizing data into sequentially linked blocks. Initially designed for Bitcoin transactions [220], blockchain has been actively applied in broad applications, especially toward the increased operation efficiency and security of smart grids [221]. It uses consensus algorithms, immutable ledgers, and decentralization to provide a secure platform for data sharing across sectors [222]. Blockchain technology enhances security by detecting bad data, increasing resilience against network attacks, and preventing data manipulation and tampering [3], [223]\u2013[225]. To understand the role of blockchain in improving smart grid security, it is important to emphasize the reliability it brings through its consensus mechanisms. Particularly, devices involved in power generation, transmission, distribution, or consumption initiate transactions by creating blocks. These blocks are validated by smart contracts, ensuring transactions adhere to a predefined set of rules. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) ensure all nodes accept the transaction [231]. Once consensus is achieved, the block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is permanently recorded in the distributed ledger. This guarantees the immutability, security, and transparency of transactions. Blockchain technology provides a robust foundation for improving security in smart grids, particularly through the implementation of microgrids [232], [233]. These smaller, autonomous grids facilitate the integration and management of blockchain, which efficiently handles localized data and peer-to-peer energy trading. The decentralized nature of blockchain aligns well with microgrids' structure, improving their security, transparency, and resilience. It ensures that energy production and consumption data are securely recorded and easily accessible. Additionally, decentralization mitigates single points of failure and reduces vulnerability to cyber threats, significantly enhancing the resilience and robustness of the microgrid [234]. Practical examples include the Brooklyn Microgrid project and the Power Ledger initiative in Australia, both of which demonstrate how local energy trading can be facilitated, making transactions easy and creating a more democratic energy market [235]. The TransActive Grid project further shows blockchain's potential to transparently log energy transactions, highlighting its applicability to smart grid technology [236]. Table VII provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain theory, including detection and mitigation methods for various attacks, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Research challenges of blockchain techniques in smart grid security: Although blockchain in smart grids brings numerous security benefits, it also present several research challenges [237]. One major challenge is scalability. Current blockchain processing capabilities may not be sufficient to handle the high volume of transactions in a large-scale smart grid. The time required for increased transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain can introduce significant delays, reducing transaction speed, increasing costs, and inhibiting real-time energy trading [226], [238]-[240]. Additionally, energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work are not sustainable for resource-constrained devices in smart grids [233], [241]. Research is needed to ensure low-latency and energy-efficient transaction validation and confirmation for real-time applications in smart grids. Interoperability is another critical issue. It is challenging to seamlessly integrate blockchain with current smart grid infrastructure and protocols [233], [242]. The lack of standardization in blockchain technology can lead to compatibility issues between different systems and technologies. Ensuring interoperability is crucial for creating comprehensive solutions that enhance the security and efficiency of the grid ecosystem. Data privacy is also a significant concern. Ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency on the blockchain is a complex problem, especially with sensitive data involved in smart grids. Disclosing transactional details can compromise user integrity and confidentiality, violating privacy preferences [233]. Research is needed to develop methods that ensure data privacy without compromising the transparency and security benefits of blockchain technology."}, {"title": "D.

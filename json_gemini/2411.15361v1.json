Introduction", "content": "An increasingly competitive environment and ever-changing customer preferences have compelled manufacturers to develop a manufacturing system that can support a large variety of high-quality products, small lot sizes, and flexibility in terms of frequent product changes, all while minimizing manufacturing costs and lead times as much as possible. A conventional mass production system, which utilizes special-purpose machines arranged in a line to facilitate smooth production, is characterized by low in-process inventory, high efficiency, and simplified management control. However, it is unsuitable for handling a multi-product, small-lot-size situation (YounesSinaki et al., 2023). On the other hand, batch and job production, which involves a large number of general-purpose machines, adopts a functional layout to suit the economics of medium and low-volume production with moderate and high variety. However, in such batch and job manufacturing systems, a part may spend up to 95% of the total production time in waiting and traveling, leading to long and uncertain throughput times (Rabbani et al., 2019). Thus, flexibility is acquired at the cost of productivity.\nTherefore, the main concerns in the emerging business world are flexibility in terms of frequent product changes and smaller batch sizes, shorter throughput times, and higher productivity. Cellular Manufacturing Systems (CMS), which are based on the philosophy of Group"}, {"title": "2. Literature Review", "content": "Several methods for forming machine-component cells have been developed over the years. Almasarwah & S\u00fcer (2019), Danilovic & Ilic (2019), Funke & Becker (2020), and Gauss et al. (2022) have all published comprehensive assessments of these approaches. These approaches are broadly classified into two categories: (i) Methods for determining part families according to parameters such as tolerance, material, and geometry (Motahari et al., 2023) and (ii) The production process is directly analyzed using Production Flow Analysis (PFA) techniques, particularly part process plans or routings (Borrett et al., 2018). A significant number of existing approaches utilize the PFA (Production Flow Analysis) approach, assuming that each part has a single process plan and that each operation in a process plan can be carried out on only one machine. In practice, however, a part may have multiple process plans, and each operation within a process plan could be performed on various machines. The grouping problem in such cases involves determining machine cells and process plan families in such a way that each machine cell can execute at least one process plan family, assigning operations to machines, and selecting a single process plan for each part.\nAlimian et al. (2020) proposed a new integer nonlinear programming approach for dynamic cellular manufacturing systems with worker assignment. This model can estimate the optimal labor assignments, cell designs, and process plans for each part type at every stage of the planning horizon. The importance of considering human factors in cellular manufacturing (CM) cannot be overstated, as neglecting them may significantly reduce the benefits of CM."}, {"title": "3.

These movements are generated in three ways depending upon the assignment of any set of consecutive operations. First, consecutive operations are assigned to the same machine in the same cell, so there is neither intercell nor intracell movement. Second, consecutive operations are assigned to different cells, causing one intercell movement. Finally, consecutive operations are assigned to different machines in the same cell, giving birth to one intracell movement.\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the minimization of intercell movements is equivalent to the maximization of the assignment of consecutive operations to the same cell and that the minimization of intracell movements is equivalent to the maximization of the assignment of consecutive operations to the same machine in the same cell. As a result, the objective function is the count of instances where consecutive operations are assigned to the same cell or to the same machine. Thus, the\nobjective function can be written as:\nmax[$\\Sigma_{c=1}^{C} \\Sigma_{k=1}^{K} \\Sigma_{p\\in PP(k)} \\Sigma_{(i,j)\\in O(kp)} \\Sigma_{m\\in M(i),n\\in M(j),m\\neq n} X_{i(kp)mc}.

X_{j(kp)nc}$]\n(3.1)\nThe first term in the objective function (3.1), considering the assignment of consecutive operations to the same cell, represents the weighted intercell movements. The weighted intracell movements are represented by the second term, which considers the assignment of consecutive operations to the same machine in the same cell. The above formulation can be used for both situations: where there is a strict technological sequence among the operations or where there is no technological sequence specified. For example, let process plan p of part k have three operations, 1, 2, and 3, in the case of strict technological sequence. Let the operations be performed in a natural sequence. Then, for intercell movements, there will be two product terms, viz., $X_{1(kp)mc}.X_{2(kp)nc}and X_{2(kp)mc}. X_{3(kp)nc}$. These terms have to be expanded for all"}, {"title": "3.2 Grouping at Operational Level: Reorganization of an Existing System", "content": "feasible machines and cells. On the other hand, if there is no prespecified technological sequence, then there will be three product terms: $X_{1(kp)mc}. X_{2(kp)nc}$, $X_{1(kp)mc}.X_{3(kp)nc}$ and $X_{2(kp)mc}.X_{3(kp)nc}$which again, have to be expanded for all feasible machines and cells. From the above terms, it is obvious that in the presence of a strict technological sequence, assigning the first and the third operation in the same cell and the second operation in some other cell will have the same number of intercell movements as by assigning the three operations in three different cells.\nThe objective function given in (3.1) contains a large number of quadratic terms and thus is computationally complex. One of the popular approaches for solving such problems is to linearize the quadratic terms. Glover and Woolsey (1974) suggested a methodology to linearize the quadratic terms at the cost of additional continuous variables and some constraints. The method is as follows. Replace each quadratic term with a continuous variable and three additional constraints. For example, the quadratic term $X_i. X_j$ can be replaced by a continuous variable $V_{ij}$ and the following three additional constraints:\n$X_i \\geq V_{ij}$\n(3.1a)\n$X_j \\geq V_{ij}$\n(3.1b)\n$X_i + X_j - V_{ij} \\leq 1$\n(3.1c)\nModi & Shanker (1995) reported that the third constraint, namely, (1c) is redundant in case both the variables are binary, and then constraints (1a) and (1b) are sufficient to linearize a quadratic term involving two binary variables.\nConstraints\n1. Selection of one process plan for each part: This constraint, by summing the variable Ykp over the whole set of process plans available for a part k and by equalizing this sum to 1, ensures that one and only one process plan is selected for each part.\n$\\Sigma_{p \\in PP(k)} Y_{kp} = 1 $\nk = 1,...,K\n(3.2)\n2. Assignment of operations: An operation of a selected process plan is assigned to one and only one machine out of several alternative machines. These constraints do not bind the assignment of all the operations of a selected process plan to machines belonging to one cell.\n$\\Sigma_{c=1}^{C} \\Sigma_{m\\in M(s)} X_{s(kp)mc} = Y_{kp}$ k=1,...,K;  $\\forall p \\in PP(k); \\forall s \\in S(kp)$\n(3.3)\n3. Loads on machines: An operation is assigned to a machine type m in cell c only if cell c has a non-zero number of copies of machine type m. Moreover, the total time required to process all operations that are assigned to a machine type in a cell must not exceed the cumulative capacity of that machine type in that cell:\n$\\Sigma_{k=1}^{K} \\Sigma_{p\\in PP(k)} \\Sigma_{s \\in S(kp)} d_k. X_{s(kp)mc}.t_{s(kp)m} \\leq b_m.N_{mc}$ m=1,...,M; c = 1,...,C\n(3.4)\n4. Number of machines assigned to a cell: For proper control and supervision of the cell and for effective utilization of the resources, it is advisable to keep the number of machines in a cell within a certain range. Small groups are undesirable, even if disjointed, because they may lead to the underutilization of resources. On the other hand, assigning too many machines to a cell may lead to a situation where proper control and supervision become difficult. Generally,"}, {"title": "3.2.1 Formulation I: Minimization of Intercell and Intracell Movements", "content": "small group size causes increased intercell movement, while large group size tends to have more intracell movements. Two extreme examples will clarify this point. Machine groups with a single machine in each will have no intracell movement but a lot of intercell movements, whereas a large group consisting of all the machines in the system will have no intercell movements but many intracell movements. Both these cases go against the concept of group technology because the philosophy of GT is to assign machines to cells in a judicious manner so that both intracell and intercell movements and, consequently, material handling activities are minimized. Thus, for better utilization of resources and proper control and supervision, the upper and lower limits on the number of machines in a cell must be specified.\n$\\Sigma_{m=1}^{M} N_{mc} \\geq min_c$ c = 1,...,C\n(3.5a)\n$\\Sigma_{m=1}^{M} N_{mc} \\leq max_c$ c = 1,...,C\n(3.5b)\n5.

They presented an integer programming model (see Appendix A) to solve the design-level grouping problem in which the total intercell movement is kept at zero (forcing the formation of strictly disjoint cells), and the objective is to minimize the total investment costs. The model includes a nonlinear constraint on the capacity of each machine type in each cell and linear constraints regarding the selection of a process plan for each part, assignment of operations for the selected process plans to machines, a budgetary limit on operating costs, and cell size. A modification is made to their model so as to make all constraints linear.

(1994). They suggested that amortized costs of machines be used as the objective function instead of investment costs and also that total annual operating costs be included in the objective function instead of being controlled by budgetary constraints (see Appendix A). Their solution approach is hierarchical: the first phase focuses on determining the system's total machine requirement and selecting a unique process plan for each part. The second phase determines the part families and machine cells using any method. While problem-solving turns out to be relatively easier with a hierarchical approach, it may lead sometimes to a suboptimal solution in the subsequent stages. This aspect will be illustrated with the help of a numerical example. For their model, a modified formulation (formulation III) is proposed, which uses a simultaneous rather than hierarchical approach to make various decisions. In fact, the modified formulation is like Logendran's model regarding only the objective function because, as far as constraints are concerned, it is similar to formulation II.\nObjective function\nMinimization of the total amortized cost of machines plus annual operating costs can be written as:\nmin[$\\Sigma_{c=1}^{C} \\Sigma_{m=1}^{M} I_{am}.

However, each machine may be required by many operations of different parts, so many copies of that machine must be acquired for different cells. This will make the investment cost very high. On the other hand, if one insists that only one copy (or minimum number of copies according to the total load for that machine type) be acquired for each machine type, then though the investment will be at its lowest, intercell movement will be considerable. The GT philosophy does not favor any of these extreme approaches, recommending instead a trade-off between these two costs, the investment and the intercell movement. This trade-off can be achieved in two ways. First, the total investment cost in the objective function should be minimized while total intercell movement is subject to a judicious non-zero maximum value. Another, minimize total intercell movement by objective function while total investment cost is subject to a judiciously determined budgetary limit.\nBoth these approaches demand a judicious value for maximum total intercell movement or maximum total investment allowed, respectively. This judgment will depend on many system factors and, more than anything else, on the experience of the modeler. Obviously, when the total number of machines has to be kept at a minimum, the machines have to be assigned to the most demanding cells. In such cases, intercell movements are bound to occur. A formulation that adopts the second of the approaches given above is presented here, i.e., minimize total intercell and intercell movement while total investment costs are kept within budgetary limits.\nObjective function\nSame as the objective function (3.1)\nConstraints\n1.

Numerical Illustration and Analysis of Results", "content": "The problem described by Rajamani et al. (1990) is used to illustrate the workings of all the formulations. The problem is as follows. Four different part types with known demand, each having multiple process plans as given in Table 1, are to be manufactured. Each operation in a process plan can be performed on more than one alternative machine. Three types of machines with known capacities and investment costs are available, and their compatibility with various operations is given in Table 2. The time and cost information for performing various operations on different machines is given in Table 3.\nFormulation I (grouping at the operational level: minimization of intercell and intracell movement) was applied to the data given in Tables 1, 2, and 3, with the additional information that the number of machines available for each type is one, the maximum number of machines that can be assigned to any cell is two and number of cells to be formed is two. Tables 4a and 4b show the results.\nFormulation II (grouping at design level: minimization of total investment cost, disjoint cells are to be formed), which is a modification to the model of Rajamani et al. (1990), was also used to solve the example problem given in Tables 1, 2 and 3, with the additional information that number of cells to be formed is two and the maximum number of machines that can be assigned to any cell is two. Tables 5a and 5b show the same results obtained by the model of (Rajamani et al., 1990).\nFormulation III (grouping at design level: minimization of amortized cost and annual operating costs; disjoint cells are to be formed), which is a modification to the model of Logendran et al. (1990), was used for the same example problem (Tables 1, 2, 3) with one modification that the investment cost (Im) is replaced by amortized cost (Iam). All other information is the same as that used for solving formulation II. The results obtained are the same as those given by formulation II, with the amortized cost being 600. This is not surprising because, as we have observed before, formulation III is very similar to formulation II. The annual operating costs, another part of the objective function, equals 330, making the objective function 930. The two costs for the same problem, as solved by Logendran et al.'s model, are 550 and 350, respectively, summing up to 900. This solution (by Logendran et al.'s model) is shown in Tables 6a and 6b.\nFormulation IV (grouping at design level: minimization of intercell and intracell movement) was also used to solve the example problem given in Tables 1, 2, and 3, with the additional information that the number of cells to be formed is two and the maximum number of machines that can be assigned to any cell is two. Here, an interesting difference is observed that when the budget limit for investment on machines is kept at 600 the solution is exactly the same as obtained by formulation II (Table 5), but when the budget restriction on machines is put at 550 the results are changed"}, {"title": "5. Conclusions", "content": "In this paper, effort has been made to develop mathematical programming formulations for the generalized grouping problem at the design and operational levels for a cellular manufacturing system. These formulations will help understand and analyze a problem in its entirety, although when the problem size is large, solving these may not be easy. These formulations may also provide valuable clues for designing heuristics, comparing solutions obtained by a heuristic, and comparing the performance of different heuristics. As a summary of the paper, briefly describing all the formulations developed would be pertinent.\nFormulation I seek to minimize intercell and intracell movement by simultaneously grouping the machines and assigning the consecutive operations of selected process plans to the same cell and to the same machine. It can be used to reorganize an existing CMS into a new CMS.\nOn the other hand, formulations II, III, and IV have been developed in this paper to set up a new CMS. Formulation II minimizes the total investment costs on machines, while formulation III minimizes the total amortized costs of machines plus annual operating costs. Formulations II and III will always produce disjoint groups. To overcome the shortcomings of formulations II and III, formulation IV is proposed, which minimizes intercell and intracell movements while keeping the investment in machines within the budgetary limit. Formulation IV is found to be more flexible than formulations II and III in terms of managerial decision-making.\nThe models presented in this paper explicitly take into account the limitations on the number of machines in a group and the capacity of machines of a particular type. They also incorporate some of the economic factors that are bound to affect grouping decisions. All the models developed in this paper are NP-hard, as stated by Logendran et al. (1994), and become computationally expensive as the problem size increases in terms of the number of parts, operations, process plans, and machines. The major recommendation for further research could be the application of modern heuristic methods like tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms to solve these problems, as these techniques have been found to be effective in solving combinatorial optimization problems."}]}

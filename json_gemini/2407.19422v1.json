Particularly, the emergence of pre-training models (PTMs) and large language models (LLMs) holds immense potential to support, augment, optimize and automate CBT delivery. This paper reviews the literature on integrating AI into CBT interventions. We begin with an overview of CBT. Then, we introduce the integration of AI into CBT across various stages: pre-treatment, therapeutic process, and post-treatment. Next, we summarized the datasets relevant to some CBT-related tasks. Finally, we discuss the benefits and current limitations of applying AI to CBT. We suggest key areas for future research, highlighting the need for further exploration and validation of the long-term efficacy and clinical utility of AI-enhanced CBT.

Psychological distress brought on by COVID-19 has added to the existing mental health crisis, leading to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Consequently, there is an urgent need for effective and accessible mental health interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as one of the most important psychological interventions for addressing a range of mental health issues Foreman and Pollard (2016); David et al (2018). As the gold standard for treating depression and anxiety, CBT has been integrated into healthcare systems worldwide. Its primary goal is to identify and restructure patients' maladaptive cognitive frameworks to help them develop coping skills, address behavioral issues, and alleviate symptoms. However, the delivery of CBT, as it is traditionally conducted individually and face-to-face by a therapist, faces barriers in real life, including social stigma and limited access to qualified therapists, particularly in underserved areas. Only 27% of those receiving psychological therapy actually access standardized care Bandelow et al (2017). To address these challenges, technological advancements have led to the development of Computer-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) and Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) Webb et al (2017). These variations use computer software and the Internet as a medium to deliver CBT interventions based on established theories and techniques. Several established online CBT platforms, such as MoodGYM Australian National University (2024) and 30-Day Self-Service Psychological Expert China Cognitive Behavioral therapy professional organization (2024), have emerged. These online platforms have partially alleviated some of the issues related to the shortage of mental health professionals and poor accessibility Christ et al (2020). However, they still face challenges, such as limited interactivity and high dropout rates. In addition, they offer interventions that address only general cognitive issues rather than individual specific needs. Given this challenge, there is an urgent need for more flexible and adaptive forms of CBT to better meet the diverse needs of different patient populations.\nIn recent years, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led various industries to explore its innovative applications. AI's exceptional capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and automation offer vast potential in the delivery of mental health services, providing new tools and methods for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions Lee et al (2021); Malgaroli et al (2023); Demszky et al (2023a). For instance, deep learning (DL) models can automate mental health assessments and diagnostic processes, alleviating the workload of professionals while enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses Vuyyuru et al (2023).

This therapeutic approach operates on the premise that thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interconnected, and aims to enhance psychological well-being by addressing maladaptive cognitive patterns and behaviors Beck and Beck (2011). The theoretical foundation of CBT encompasses both cognitive and behavioral aspects. Regarding the origins of CBT, there are varying views in the academic community. However, it is generally accepted that the popularization of the \"cognition\" began with Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) in the 1950s, followed by Beck's Cognitive Therapy (CT) in the 1960s. Since then, CBT has continuously integrated various behavioral therapies and theories, evolving into the widely used psychological treatment seen today.\nCBT interventions typically target three domains: cognition, behavior, and emotion McGinn and Sanderson (2001). In the cognitive domain, CBT focuses on individuals' cognitive processes, including thoughts, beliefs, and interpretations.

To provide a summary of the extant literature on the integration of AI into CBT across the delivery process, we conducted a literature review by performing searches on the ArXiv and Google Scholar database without date restrictions. Search terms considered in this review were selected based on two elements, CBT (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive distortions,"}, {"title": "3.1 Integration of AI in the Pre-Treatment Stage", "content": "A comprehensive assessment is a foundational step in all psychological treatments, including CBT. This initial assessment involves gathering information on the client's history, current issues, and therapeutic goals through structured or semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and standardized scales. In CBT, particular emphasis is placed on assessing the client's cognitive and behavioral patterns, as well as their emotional responses. The insights from this detailed assessment guides therapists in crafting tailored CBT treatment plans that effectively address the client's concerns, thereby maximizing therapeutic outcomes. Traditional CBT assessment methods, while thorough, often rely heavily on manual processes, which can be subjective and time-consuming. The reliance on the therapist's clinical skills and professional acumen can may also limit diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. In contrast, AI technology, with its advanced data processing and analysis capabilities, offers a powerful alternative. AI can rapidly analyze vast amounts of client data to identify patterns and correlations, thereby assisting therapists in assessing patient symptoms more accurately and swiftly, and in identifying adverse emotions and cognitive distortions."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Mental health assessment", "content": "AI is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and assessment of common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Wanderley Espinola et al (2022) proposed a methodology to support the diagnosis of mental disorders in psychiatric emergency context using vocal acoustic analysis and machine learning, targeting disorders like major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Siddiqua et al (2023) employed a survey questionnaire distributed among Bangladeshi students with a total of 684 responses were obtained, and utilized ten machine learning models and two deep learning models to predict three levels of depression severity (normal, moderate, and extreme) with remarkable accuracy. Vuyyuru et al (2023)introduced the Trans-CNN, which effectively integrates the strengths of Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. This model demonstrates superior performance in identifying depressive disorders compared to traditional CBT methods and standalone Transformer or CNN models by analyzing textual data such as patient narratives, treatment records, and diagnostic reports.\nDespite these advancements, the existing research is centered around AI models focused on the diagnosis and assessment of singular psychological disorders, with limited research dedicated to the development of comprehensive models capable of simultaneously diagnosing multiple co-occurring psychological conditions."}, {"title": "Identifying cognitive distortions", "content": "CBT postulates an individual's emotions and behaviors are influenced by their perception and interpretation of events. Cognitive distortions refer to erroneous or irrational patterns of thinking that can lead to negative emotions and maladaptive behaviors.

This understanding enables therapists or conversational agents to offer more empathetic support and feedback in CBT interventions, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance and enhancing the interactive experience Brave et al (2005); Provoost et al (2019). Furthermore, emotional states also serve as indicators of intrinsic goals, observable behaviors, and treatment efficacy. During the therapeutic process, individuals are more likely to benefit from treatment when they can effectively manage their emotions Mehta et al (2021). Therefore, during the initial assessment phase, therapists explore the clients' emotional responses and assist them acquire healthier emotion regulation strategies. AI-assisted emotion analysis has become increasingly prevalent in mental health Tanana et al (2021); Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al (2022); Khare et al (2023). Provoost et al (2019) employed an emotion mining algorithm to assess the overall sentiment and five specific emotions expressed in texts written by patients during Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), finding moderate agreement between the algorithm and human judgment in evaluating the overall sentiment, while the agreement was low for specific emotions. Patel et al (2019) proposed an intelligent social therapeutic chatbot. This chatbot defined several basic emotion labels, and based on these emotion labels, three deep learning algorithms were employed to extract emotions from user chat data. Koz\u0142owski et al (2023) introduced Terabot, a conversational system that enhanced sentiment and emotion recognition by integrating CBT techniques and replacing BERT with RoBERTa in a neural language model framework. However, Striegl et al (2023) pointed out that some emotion recognition methods Fitzpatrick et al (2017); Provoost et al (2019) categorize emotions into discrete classes, failing to capture the continuum and diversity of emotions accurately. To address this, they proposed a deep learning-based dimensional text emotion recognition system within the context of CBT using the ALBERT pre-trained model Lan et al (2019), fine-tuned on emotion-annotated data for dimensional score prediction.\nIn recent years, ChatGPT, as a prominent example of conversational AI, shows potential in assisting individuals with emotion understanding and management. Rathje et al (2023) initially assessed GPT's capability for overall sentiment analysis (positivity, negativity, or neutrality) in English and Arabic texts. They found that GPT demonstrates effective multilingual sentiment analysis, achieving performance levels comparable to top-performing machine learning models from previous years. Furthermore, they examined GPT's ability to accurately discern more nuanced discrete emotions such as anger, joy, fear, and sadness. The results demonstrated a high level of consistency between GPT's performance and human judgement. Elyoseph et al (2023) also underscored GPT's superiority over humans in emotional cognition, as highlighted in their study."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Personalized treatment selection: identifying CBT beneficiaries", "content": "Within the realm of precision medicine, aligning clients with the most suitable treatment is a critical and significant objective Ozomaro et al (2013). This involves selecting an effective treatment plan before commencing therapy, thereby avoiding the risks associated with ineffective treatments. CBT is a well-established psychotherapy approach to address mental health issues, however, its effectiveness varies among individuals experiencing different mental health conditions. This variability highlights the need to identify which clients are likely to respond favorably to CBT and to assess its effectiveness in treating specific mental health conditions. Researchers are increasingly exploring the potential of AI models to predict which clients may benefit from CBT and to determine the most appropriate treatment for each person Ball et al (2014); Reggente et al (2018); Vieira et al (2022). Studies suggest that AI can analyze extensive clinical data to forecast which patients are more likely to respond positively to CBT. This capability can assist clinicians in selecting suitable candidates for CBT, thereby optimizing resource allocation. For example, Reggente et al (2018) used machine learning with cross-validation to investigate the potential of functional connectivity patterns to predict obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom severity in individuals after treatment. The findings have important clinical implications, particularly in the development of personalized medicine approaches aimed at identifying OCD patients who would derive the greatest benefit from intensive CBT. Similarly, Vieira et al (2022) conducted a comprehensive review and quantitative synthesis of previous studies utilizing machine learning to predict the outcomes of CBT treatment in various diagnostic categories. They concluded that, on an individual level, the accuracy of predicting CBT benefit was approximately 74.0%.\nBesides CBT, other types of psychological interventions, such as Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) and person-centered counseling for depression may be equally effective. Moreover, not all clients may require high-intensity CBT interventions. Some individuals might benefit from low-intensity interventions. Traditionally, the trial-and-error method in psychotherapy can be both time-consuming and costly, with the risk of clients undergoing multiple ineffective treatments before finding the one that works best for them. This not only delays effective care but also increases the overall cost of treatment. Therefore, determining the most suitable treatment for specific individuals before the delivery of therapy is crucial. Addressing this gap, Delgadillo and Gonzalez Salas Duhne (2020) and Schwartz et al (2021) had applied machine learning algorithms to recommend optimal treatment approaches based on patients' pre-treatment characteristics. This method can contribute to substantial cost savings in mental health care, making high-quality psychotherapy more accessible and affordable."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Client psychoeducation", "content": "In CBT, client education is a crucial step both before and throughout the therapy process, as shown in Figure 1. Before commencing therapy, psychoeducation involves introducing the fundamental principles and techniques of CBT, aiding them in understanding common patterns of negative emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and coping strategies McGinn and Sanderson (2001). In the treatment process, psychoeducation is reflected in teaching clients how to identify and assess automatic thoughts, how to perform cognitive restructuring, and how to find alternative explanations for automatic thoughts, thereby adjusting these automatic thoughts. By conveying that individuals can acquire and master skills to address psychological issues, psychoeducation enhances clients' sense of self-efficacy and can even contribute to symptom reduction on its own Cuijpers (1998).\nPsychoeducation can be delivered through various formats, including written materials, videos, audio recordings, as well as organizing specialized lectures and seminars. The advent of mobile applications has introduced novel avenues for delivering psychological education and support, capitalizing on their convenience and adaptability. Psychological education has been seamlessly integrated into several mobile applications, some of which have demonstrated efficacy in treating various mental disorders, including stress Rose et al (2013), anxiety and depression Harrison et al (2011), eating disordersCardi et al (2013), post-traumatic stress disorder Reger et al (2013), and obsessive-compulsive disorder Whiteside et al (2014). For instance, Whiteside et al (2014) developed the smartphone application \"Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach\", designed to deliver CBT for anxiety disorders, including OCD. This application comprises a psychological education module that instructs users on the utilization of the application, conceptualization of anxiety, descriptions of various anxiety disorders, explanations of CBT, and guidance on assessing alternative forms of therapy. Similarly, Mart\u00ednez-Miranda et al (2019) developed a mobile-based embodied conversational agent (ECA) for the prevention and detection of suicidal behavior. The ECA introduces users to a segment of psychoeducational video in which a combination of cartoon-like images in motion are accompanied by a narrator explaining the basic elements of CBT. Users can access the video at any time through the application's main menu. The advantages of delivering psychological education through mobile applications are self-evident:"}, {"title": "3.2 Integration of AI in CBT therapeutic process", "content": "CBT intervention encompasses the implementation of various strategies, including cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and exposure therapy, etc. These strategies are intrinsically connected to cognition, emotions, and behavior.

In BA, therapists collaborate with clients to formulate specific goals and plans, encourage the modification of negative behavior patterns, gradually increase the frequency and diversity of positive activities, and help clients regain a sense of pleasure and meaningful engagement in daily life. Lewinsohn (1974) and Jacobson et al (1996) demonstrated that behavioral activation achieves outcomes comparable to full CBT and is comparable to pharmacotherapy Dimidjian et al (2006). Individuals with mental disease may have problems with reduced daily activities, loss of interest, avoidance behavior and social avoidance. To facilitate the application of BA, researchers have developed innovative interventions.\nInnovative interventions have been developed to facilitate BA application. Dahne et al (2019) developed a Spanish-language behavioral activation self-help mobile application called \u00a1Apt\u00edvate!. Within this app, the user identifies individualized values and associated activities across five life areas, including relationships, daily responsibilities, recreation, career and education, and health. Evaluation results also demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of this app. Rohani et al (2020) developed a mobile health system called MUBS (Mobile-based Behavioral Activation System) to support patients with depression through behavioral activation therapy. The system implements a unique content-based probabilistic recommendation algorithm to motivate patients to engage in positive behaviors by providing activity directories and personalized rewards, helping them build awareness of behavioral activation."}, {"title": "Exposure therapy (ET)", "content": "Exposure therapy, a common technique in CBT, involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety-provoking or phobias-provoking situations to help them adapt and reduce their fear responses Abramowitz (2013). It is used to treat various psychological disorders, including specific phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a potent adjunct to traditional exposure therapy Jameel (2020), leading to the development of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), validated by research for its effectiveness within CBT Scozzari and Gamberini (2011); Maples-Keller et al (2017); \u00d8rskov et al (2022).\nWhile VRET may not yield superior results in terms of therapeutic efficacy compared to traditional exposure therapy within the CBT framework, it presents unique advantages like enhanced patient comfort, safety, real-time customization of exposure content, and simulation of personalized real-life scenarios. The integration of VR with CBT has led to the development of interactive applications and serious games to augment therapeutic interventions. Heng (2021) developed ReWIND, an RPG-styled serious game based on the ABCDE model of CBT. The design intention of ReWIND is to immerse players diagnosed with symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in various anxiety-inducing situations within a virtual environment and provide them with constructive psychological interventions. The game aims to deliver psychological education to players in an engaging and interactive manner. Similarly, Giordano et al (2022) emphasize that CBT is the most successful protocol in gambling disorder (GD) treatment, and they developed a serious virtual game called Alter Game, based on VRET, aimed at preventing relapse in patients with gambling disorder. Additionally, Michelle et al (2014) proposed an Android application named CBT Assistant, where patients can choose, set, and customize their own exposure fear ladders based on a generic template for graded exposure therapy. This feature distinguishes CBT Assistant from other CBT applications. The fusion of VRET with AI technology further enhances its efficacy in addressing mental health challenges. \u00c5hs et al (2020)"}, {"title": "Homework", "content": "A CBT session typically lasts 45-60 minutes, which is often insufficient for many patients. Homework assignments bridge the gap between sessions, allowing patients to apply learned skills and enabling therapists to assess skill acquisition and maintenance Beck (1979); LeBeau et al (2013). In the professional literature, homework assignments are frequently delineated as precise, structured therapeutic tasks upon during sessions, intended for completion between sessions. This process entails collaborative delineation of therapeutic objectives for the homework, determining pertinent activities or data collection as components of the homework, strategizing the practical execution of the homework, and subsequently reviewing the homework during subsequent sessions Kazantzis et al (2010). Homework assignments may encompass a range of activities within each session, such as engaging with relevant materials, documenting thoughts and emotions, practicing specific skills or behaviors, or engaging in communication with others Tang et al (2017).\nResearch has found that clients who consistently complete homework derive greater benefits from interventions compared to those who complete little or no homework Burns and Spangler (2000), yet traditional paper-based CBT homework pose various impediments that can significantly undermine users' motivation to complete tasks as instructed. Non-compliance with homework is cited as one of the most common reasons for the failure of CBT treatments Helbig and Fehm (2004), persisting as a prevalent issue in clinical practice. The prevalence of digital devices and the internet has enabled the transformation of traditional homework into digital formats, thereby enhance CBT homework compliance. However, there is a lack of guidelines for designing mobile phone apps tailored for this purpose. Consequently, Tang et al (2017) proposes six essential features of an optimal mobile app aimed at maximizing CBT homework compliance, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the development of such applications.\nInnovative approaches, such as the integration of traditional diary writing with mobile technology and LLM, offer promising solutions to enhance homework compliance. For example, Peretz et al (2023) developed a machine learning model capable of recognizing the presence of homework assignments during therapy sessions based on natural language dialogue between therapists and clients in real-world settings, as well as determining the type of homework assigned. Such advancements hold significant promise in bolstering therapists' ability to assign and monitor homework tasks, ultimately fostering enhancements in therapeutic outcomes. Nepal et al (2024) integrated traditional diary writing with mobile technology and LLM to create a diary application with contextual awareness, named MindScape. Specifically, the application utilizes real-time analysis of behavioral data collected from smartphones and employs LLM to provide personalized, contextually relevant writing prompts.

Recent advancements in AI have fostered the creation of digital tools that utilize the principles and techniques of CBT. These tools integrate multiple CBT strategies, thus providing a comprehensive approach to treatment. AI-powered chatbots, also referred to as conversational agents or relational agents exemplify such innovations, with chatbots being particularly notable. According to a review by Abd et al. Abd-Alrazaq et al (2019), out of 17 chatbots offering psychotherapy, 10 were based on CBT. They are capable of mimicking the communication styles of human therapists by engaging users in interactive dialogues that include both verbal and non-verbal exchanges. This allows them to offer efficient, personalized, and readily accessible CBT treatment, available 24/7. Pioneering chatbots like Woebot, Wysa, Tess, and Youper are emblematic of this trend. Their innovative approaches and effectiveness have garnered significant attention and recognition as effective psychological support systems based on CBT. In recent years, in response to diverse needs, researchers have developed many new AI tools based on CBT principles Oliveira et al (2021); Rizea (2022); Rani et al (2023); Sabour et al (2023); Su et al (2022); Nwoye et al (2024).

Traditionally, quality assessment is performed by human evaluators who listen to therapy recordings and review therapy notes to assess specific therapeutic skills. However, this approach is costly and time-consuming, resulting in limited feasibility and hindering widespread implementation in practical settings. To address these challenges, some researchers and technology developers have begun exploring the use of automated techniques to monitor the quality of psychotherapy. AI offers automated solutions for assessing therapy sessions and monitoring treatment fidelity of CBT sessions Chen et al (2022a). For example, Ewbank et al (2020) used a large-scale dataset containing session transcripts from more than 14000 patients receiving internet-enabled CBT (IECBT) to train a deep learning model to automatically categorize therapist utterances according to the role that they play in therapy, generating a quantifiable measure of treatment delivered. The closer the content provided by the therapist aligns with standard CBT protocols, the more positively it correlates with significant symptom improvement in patients. Conversely, the quantity of content unrelated to therapy shows a negative association. This method allows for the indirect assessment of the efficacy of CBT psychotherapy provided by the therapist. However, Flemotomos et al (2021) emphasize that, for CBT, the most commonly utilized coding scheme is the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS), which defines a set of 11 session-level codes reflecting skills and techniques specific to the intervention. Consequently, they introduced a model for quality assessment of psychotherapy sessions based on adapted BERT representations of therapy language use. Their analysis focused on the binary classification of CBT sessions concerning the overall CTRS score. Chen et al (2022b) also utilized CTRS scores to assess the quality of CBT sessions. However, unlike Flemotomos et al (2021), they proposed a hierarchical framework for automatically evaluating the quality of transcribed CBT interactions. Ardulov et al (2022) proposed an approach that explicitly focuses on control-affine dynamical system models. They attempted to extract local dynamic modes from short windows of conversation and learn to correlate the observed dynamics with CBT competence. Furthermore, some studies aim to identify areas where the therapist excels and areas where improvement is needed by analyzing recordings of therapy sessions, comparing therapists' language and behavior against standards of specific therapeutic models Stirman et al (2021); Flemotomos et al (2022); Zhang et al (2023); Wang et al (2024a). This process aids therapists in enhancing their professional skills, thereby improving the overall quality of therapy. Particularly, Wang et al (2024a) developed PATIENT-\u03a8, a novel patient simulation framework for CBT training. Specifically, they constructed diverse patient profiles and corresponding cognitive models based on CBT principles, and used a large language model to act as a simulated therapy patient. This role-playing therapeutic scenario helps mental health trainees practice CBT skills."}, {"title": "Predictive analysis of clients treatment adherence", "content": "Treatment adherence refers to the extent to which clients actively engage in and comply with the advice and instructions provided by healthcare professionals, thereby adhering to the treatment regimen, and it directly impacts the effectiveness and outcomes of the treatment DiMatteo et al (2002). Therefore, client adherence evaluation is essential components of effective healthcare delivery. Particularly, against the backdrop of ICBT, there has been a reduction in face-to-face interactions between healthcare professionals and clients, which may lead to low client engagement and high dropout rates. AI models can analyze client behavior and responses during therapy sessions to evaluate their understanding, engagement, and adherence to treatment content. C\u00f4t\u00e9-Allard et al (2022) presents a minimally data-sensitive approach, based on a self-attention deep neural network, to perform adherence forecasting of clients undergoing G-ICBT. This study leverages between 7 to 42 days of user-interaction data (login/logout) from the eMeistring platform. This analysis can identify individuals who may be at risk of early dropout from intervention. With this information, clinicians can implement meaningful and targeted interventions such as reminders, scheduling direct interactions, or modifying the treatment approach to prevent premature termination."}, {"title": "3.3 Integration of AI in Post-treatment Stage", "content": "Since current CBT interventions typically have relatively short durations, leading to inadequate durability of effects for some patients post-treatment, with a considerable proportion experiencing relapse after treatment cessation. Hence, predicting individual long-term clinical responses and relapse risks remains a significant challenge. AI presents a promising avenue for predicting relapse risks and enhancing the durability of CBT's effects in patients undergoing CBT. M\u00e5nsson et al (2015) proposed the first study using the multivariate SVM-fMRI method to successfully predict long-term treatment response of ICBT for social anxiety disorder, achieving a predictive accuracy reached 92% (95% confidence interval 73.2-97.6). Lorimer et al (2021) utilized machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm, to analyze follow-up data of patients undergoing Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (LiCBT). They developed a dynamic prediction tool capable of identifying cases with higher relapse risk at four distinct time points during the patients' treatment journey, with the ability to dynamically adjust prediction accuracy. This tool's capacity for early identification of high-relapse cases, combined with targeted relapse prevention measures, can significantly enhance the long-term efficacy of LiCBT in situations where psychological resources are limited.\nIn conclusion, the integration of AI in CBT holds promise for revolutionizing the delivery and efficacy of psychological interventions. By leveraging AI technologies throughout various stages of the treatment process, clinicians can enhance treatment outcomes, personalize interventions, and optimize resource allocation, ultimately improving mental health outcomes for individuals on a global scale."}, {"title": "4 Datasets", "content": "Datasets play a crucial role in driving research at the intersection of CBT and AI, providing foundational material for training, testing, and validating AI algorithms, and furnishing practitioners and researchers with the bedrock for constructing and evaluating CBT models.

In the context of disease diagnosis and assessment tasks, numerous datasets have already been extensively reviewed in various comprehensive articles. Consequently, we will not elaborate on these datasets further in this paper. Moreover, it is worth noting that for the task of selecting personalized treatment strategies, there is a noticeable lack of publicly available datasets. This paper will not cover these datasets in detail.

As can be seen from this table, most of the cognitive distortion data sets are in English, and fewer are in Chinese. Moreover, these datasets present several notable challenges: First, low reliability. The labeling criteria vary significantly across different datasets, leading to inconsistencies. Moreover, the inherently subjective nature of labeling cognitive distortions further compromises reliability. Second, there is a pronounced issue of data imbalance, with certain classes of cognitive distortions lacking adequate representation.

However, delivery of CBT is often constrained by resource limitations and barriers to access. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have provided technical support for the digital transformation of CBT. Particularly, the emergence of pre-training models (PTMs) and large language models (LLMs) holds immense potential to support, augment, optimize and automate CBT delivery. This paper reviews the literature on integrating AI into CBT interventions. We begin with an overview of CBT. Then, we introduce the integration of AI into CBT across various stages: pre-treatment, therapeutic process, and post-treatment. Next, we summarized the datasets relevant to some CBT-related tasks. Finally, we discuss the benefits and current limitations of applying AI to CBT. We suggest key areas for future research, highlighting the need for further exploration and validation of the long-term efficacy and clinical utility of AI-enhanced CBT. The transformative potential of AI in reshaping the practice of CBT heralds a new era of more accessible, efficient, and personalized mental health interventions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Mental health issues have become increasingly prevalent, especially in the post-pandemic era Penninx et al (2022). Psychological distress brought on by COVID-19 has added to the existing mental health crisis, leading to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Consequently, there is an urgent need for effective and accessible mental health interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as one of the most important psychological interventions for addressing a range of mental health issues Foreman and Pollard (2016); David et al (2018). As the gold standard for treating depression and anxiety, CBT has been integrated into healthcare systems worldwide. Its primary goal is to identify and restructure patients' maladaptive cognitive frameworks to help them develop coping skills, address behavioral issues, and alleviate symptoms. However, the delivery of CBT, as it is traditionally conducted individually and face-to-face by a therapist, faces barriers in real life, including social stigma and limited access to qualified therapists, particularly in underserved areas. Only 27% of those receiving psychological therapy actually access standardized care Bandelow et al (2017). To address these challenges, technological advancements have led to the development of Computer-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) and Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) Webb et al (2017). These variations use computer software and the Internet as a medium to deliver CBT interventions based on established theories and techniques. Several established online CBT platforms, such as MoodGYM Australian National University (2024) and 30-Day Self-Service Psychological Expert China Cognitive Behavioral therapy professional organization (2024), have emerged. These online platforms have partially alleviated some of the issues related to the shortage of mental health professionals and poor accessibility Christ et al (2020). However, they still face challenges, such as limited interactivity and high dropout rates. In addition, they offer interventions that address only general cognitive issues rather than individual specific needs. Given this challenge, there is an urgent need for more flexible and adaptive forms of CBT to better meet the diverse needs of different patient populations.\nIn recent years, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have led various industries to explore its innovative applications. AI's exceptional capabilities in data analysis, pattern recognition, and automation offer vast potential in the delivery of mental health services, providing new tools and methods for assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions Lee et al (2021); Malgaroli et al (2023); Demszky et al (2023a). For instance, deep learning (DL) models can automate mental health assessments and diagnostic processes, alleviating the workload of professionals while enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of diagnoses Vuyyuru et al (2023). Furthermore, AI can also aid in detecting and understanding patients' unique emotional expressions, thereby offering recommendations for personalized psychological interventions and support Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al (2022). Given the shortage of skilled mental health professionals, innovative AI approaches have been developed to guide peer-to-peer mental health support Sharma et al (2023a). Additionally, AI-based psychological counseling support systems, such as those utilizing large language models (LLMs), have also been developed to assist junior counselors in providing online psychological support Fu et al (2023). These studies demonstrate that AI not only expands the boundaries of traditional mental health services, but also brings new opportunities for improving their accessibility and utility globally Graham et al (2019); Demszky et al (2023b). In the realm of CBT, the integration of AI has led to revolutionary advancements, particularly with the rise of LLMs. Notable research in this area includes the development of CBT-specific prompts and tailored datasets, leading to models like CBT-LLM, which are specifically designed for CBT delivery Na (2024). Other efforts have resulted in conversational counseling agents based on LLMs, such as utilizing GPT-2 in CBT to generate human-like textual narratives to provide psychological support Rajagopal et al (2021), providing psychological counseling using CBT techniques Lee et al (2024), and delivering dialogue modules focused on Socratic questioning using LLMs like OsakaED and GPT-4 Izumi et al (2024). These advancements have made cognitive behavioral interventions more personalized and precise, better addressing the needs of diverse patients.\nGiven the abundance of research emerging in this field, several review articles have summarized innovative developments in CBT. However, the exsiting reviews focused mainly on CBT applications Huguet et al (2016); Denecke et al (2022) and the development of ChatGPT in redesigning CBT for different age groups and genders Chandra et al (2023). There is a lack of comprehensive review summarizing the application of AI's role across various stages of CBT delivery. To address this, we provide a detailed literature review of AI's role in enhancing CBT in this paper."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) stands as a structured, time-limited psychological treatment that focuses on the interplay between cognitive processes, emotional responses, and behavioral patterns. This therapeutic approach operates on the premise that thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are interconnected, and aims to enhance psychological well-being by addressing maladaptive cognitive patterns and behaviors Beck and Beck (2011). The theoretical foundation of CBT encompasses both cognitive and behavioral aspects. Regarding the origins of CBT, there are varying views in the academic community. However, it is generally accepted that the popularization of the \"cognition\" began with Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) in the 1950s, followed by Beck's Cognitive Therapy (CT) in the 1960s. Since then, CBT has continuously integrated various behavioral therapies and theories, evolving into the widely used psychological treatment seen today.\nCBT interventions typically target three domains: cognition, behavior, and emotion McGinn and Sanderson (2001). In the cognitive domain, CBT focuses on individuals' cognitive processes, including thoughts, beliefs, and interpretations. This involves aiding clients in identifying and understanding negative or distorted thought patterns, such as negative automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions (CD) (e.g., jumping to conclusions, all-or-nothing thinking and mental filtering). Techniques like cognitive restructuring (CR) are used to adjust these patterns, fostering a more objective and positive perspective toward oneself and the world. In the behavioral domain, CBT addresses individuals' maladaptive behavioral patterns and habits. Therapists collaborate with clients to explore their unhealthy behaviors, such as social withdrawal, avoidance, and substance or alcohol misuse. Techniques such as behavioral experiments, graded exposure, and behavioral activation (BA) are then employed. Further, CBT acknowledges the interplay between the body and the mind. Physiological responses such as tension, fear, and anxiety can impact cognition and behavior. Thus, CBT also focuses on regulating physiological responses through techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and physical activity to enhance emotional regulation and psychological well-being. For the emotional domain, CBT targets clients' emotional awareness and ways to manage them by aiding clients to recognize negative emotions as they arise, accurately identify them, and utilize appropriate cognitive and behavioral strategies to support better emotional well-being. The three domains are intertwined, and CBT typically tailors a range of techniques and strategies based on the individual's specific circumstances and needs, aiding in problem-solving, improving mental health, and building resilience Dobson and Dozois (2021).\nCBT has been employed to address a variety of mental health issues, including anxiety disorder Olatunji et al (2010), depression Tymofiyeva et al (2019), schizophrenia Turkington et al (2004), attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder Pan et al (2019), insomnia Benard and Lukandu (2018), eating disorders Linardon et al (2017), bipolar disorder Driessen and Hollon (2010), substance use disorders McHugh et al (2010), and obsessive-compulsive disorder Moody et al (2017). Beyond mental health, CBT has been explored as a tool for managing chronic health conditions like low back pain Piette et al (2016); Heapy et al (2017), asthma Parry et al (2012), and tinnitus Parry et al (2012). Prior to initiating CBT, therapists typically conduct assessments to determine symptom severity and treatment goals. These assessments may involve dialogue between therapist and client or self-administered tools like the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) or the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) Bech et al (1996); Beck et al (1988); Foa et al (1993). Based on this assessment, therapists work with the clients to establish treatment goals and offer personalized cognitive and behavioral strategies tailored to their needs."}, {"title": "3 Artificial intelligence in CBT", "content": "Integrating AI into CBT presents a myriad of potential applications, promising to enhance the effectiveness and utility of therapy. To provide a summary of the extant literature on the integration of AI into CBT across the delivery process, we conducted a literature review by performing searches on the ArXiv and Google Scholar database without date restrictions. Search terms considered in this review were selected based on two elements, CBT (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive distortions, cognitive restructuring, and exposure therapy) and technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language model, chatbot, and virtual reality). Articles that enhance, support, or implement CBT through AI technology will be selected. Results were categorized based on the stage at which AI was integrated in the CBT delivery process and were synthesized. In this section, we present the synthesized findings describing the role of AI in different stages of the CBT treatment process, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nTo be clear, this article only covers the stages of CBT that current AI technology has addressed. Due to the complexity of CBT treatment, some details and specific treatment stages have not yet been covered by AI, and thus are not discussed here. Future research and technological advancements may further expand AI's role in CBT delivery, encompassing more stages of the treatment process."}, {"title": "3.1 Integration of AI in the Pre-Treatment Stage", "content": "A comprehensive assessment is a foundational step in all psychological treatments, including CBT. This initial assessment involves gathering information on the client's history, current issues, and therapeutic goals through structured or semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and standardized scales. In CBT, particular emphasis is placed on assessing the client's cognitive and behavioral patterns, as well as their emotional responses. The insights from this detailed assessment guides therapists in crafting tailored CBT treatment plans that effectively address the client's concerns, thereby maximizing therapeutic outcomes. Traditional CBT assessment methods, while thorough, often rely heavily on manual processes, which can be subjective and time-consuming. The reliance on the therapist's clinical skills and professional acumen can may also limit diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency. In contrast, AI technology, with its advanced data processing and analysis capabilities, offers a powerful alternative. AI can rapidly analyze vast amounts of client data to identify patterns and correlations, thereby assisting therapists in assessing patient symptoms more accurately and swiftly, and in identifying adverse emotions and cognitive distortions."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Mental health assessment", "content": "Disease diagnosis and symptom severity assessment\nAI is increasingly employed for the diagnosis and assessment of common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Wanderley Espinola et al (2022) proposed a methodology to support the diagnosis of mental disorders in psychiatric emergency context using vocal acoustic analysis and machine learning, targeting disorders like major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Siddiqua et al (2023) employed a survey questionnaire distributed among Bangladeshi students with a total of 684 responses were obtained, and utilized ten machine learning models and two deep learning models to predict three levels of depression severity (normal, moderate, and extreme) with remarkable accuracy. Vuyyuru et al (2023)introduced the Trans-CNN, which effectively integrates the strengths of Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. This model demonstrates superior performance in identifying depressive disorders compared to traditional CBT methods and standalone Transformer or CNN models by analyzing textual data such as patient narratives, treatment records, and diagnostic reports.\nDespite these advancements, the existing research is centered around AI models focused on the diagnosis and assessment of singular psychological disorders, with limited research dedicated to the development of comprehensive models capable of simultaneously diagnosing multiple co-occurring psychological conditions."}, {"title": "Identifying cognitive distortions", "content": "CBT postulates an individual's emotions and behaviors are influenced by their perception and interpretation of events. Cognitive distortions refer to erroneous or irrational patterns of thinking that can lead to negative emotions and maladaptive behaviors. During the initial assessment phase of CBT, therapists collaborate with clients to explore these cognitive patterns and reactions to specific events, aiming to assist the client in identifying and understanding potential cognitive distortions, which were categorized into ten types by Burns theory Burns and Beck (1999). They include: all-or-nothing thinking, over generalization, mental filter, disqualifying the positive, jumping to conclusions, magnification and minimization, emotional reasoning, should statements, labeling and mislabeling, and blaming oneself or others.\nCurrently, AI technology facilitates the identification of cognitive distortions primarily through text classification techniques. Researchers utilize various textual data as inputs to build models and algorithms that automatically identify and categorize these cognitive distortions. However, due to the lack of publicly available structured datasets specifically designed for detecting cognitive distortions, researchers often turn to alternative data sources such as social media data Alhaj et al (2022); Wang et al (2023b), personal blogs Simms et al (2017), and everyday narratives Xing et al (2017); Shickel et al (2020); Mostafa et al (2021). Shreevastava and Foltz (2021) compared five classification algorithms for detecting cognitive distortions using a therapist Q&A dataset obtained from Kaggle. Tauscher et al (2023) applied NLP methods to identify cognitive distortions from text messages exchanged between patients with severe mental illnesses and their clinical therapists. Challenges in this task include dealing with short texts that lack contextual information and imbalanced data where certain distortion types are underrepresented, leading to poorer classification performance. To address these issues, researchers have proposed various solutions. Alhaj et al (2022) suggest enriching short textual representations to improve cognitive distortions' classification of the Arabic context over Twitter. It also utilizes a transformer-based topic modeling algorithm (BERTopic) that employs a pre-trained language model (AraBERT). Ding et al (2022) tackled data imbalance with approaches like data augmentation and domain-specific models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pre-trained language model MentalBERT. Recent advances have expanded the scope of cognitive distortion detection to include multimodal datasets. This cross-modal research approach provides a more holistic perspective, enabling a more comprehensive detection of cognitive distortions. For instance, Singh et al (2023) proposed a multitask framework that integrates text, audio, and visual data to detect cognitive distortions, achieving significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art models.\nRecently, LLMs have also shown promise in complex psychological tasks such as identifying cognitive distortions Qi et al (2023); Nazarova (2023); Chen et al (2023); Lim et al (2024). Qi et al (2023) conduct experiments to compare LLMs and supervised learning in cognitive distortion identification and suicide risk classification. The experimental results indicate that LLMs struggle with accurately identifying complex cognitive distortions in Chinese social media data, suggesting that deep learning algorithms remain the preferred solution for complex psychological tasks like cognitive distortion identification. Nazarova (2023) developed TeaBot, an AI tool fine-tuned on GPT-3, and employs CBT techniques to aid users in identifying and challenging distorted thoughts. Chen et al (2023) introduced the Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) framework, which strategically prompts the LLMs to produce diagnosis rationales pertinent for cognitive distortions detection. Although the DoT method demonstrates its capability in classifying cognitive distortions, it also exhibits a notable flaw, namely, the model tends to over-diagnose cognitive distortions even when the user's statements are benign. Lim et al (2024) addressed this by introducing the ERD framework, involving extraction, reasoning, and debate among multiple LLM agents to classify cognitive distortions from user utterances. This approach significantly mitigates the issue of overdiagnosing cognitive distortions in the DoT method."}, {"title": "Emotion analysis", "content": "Emotion analysis is essential for understanding individuals' emotional states. This understanding enables therapists or conversational agents to offer more empathetic support and feedback in CBT interventions, thereby strengthening the therapeutic alliance and enhancing the interactive experience Brave et al (2005); Provoost et al (2019). Furthermore, emotional states also serve as indicators of intrinsic goals, observable behaviors, and treatment efficacy. During the therapeutic process, individuals are more likely to benefit from treatment when they can effectively manage their emotions Mehta et al (2021). Therefore, during the initial assessment phase, therapists explore the clients' emotional responses and assist them acquire healthier emotion regulation strategies. AI-assisted emotion analysis has become increasingly prevalent in mental health Tanana et al (2021); Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al (2022); Khare et al (2023). Provoost et al (2019) employed an emotion mining algorithm to assess the overall sentiment and five specific emotions expressed in texts written by patients during Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), finding moderate agreement between the algorithm and human judgment in evaluating the overall sentiment, while the agreement was low for specific emotions. Patel et al (2019) proposed an intelligent social therapeutic chatbot. This chatbot defined several basic emotion labels, and based on these emotion labels, three deep learning algorithms were employed to extract emotions from user chat data. Koz\u0142owski et al (2023) introduced Terabot, a conversational system that enhanced sentiment and emotion recognition by integrating CBT techniques and replacing BERT with RoBERTa in a neural language model framework. However, Striegl et al (2023) pointed out that some emotion recognition methods Fitzpatrick et al (2017); Provoost et al (2019) categorize emotions into discrete classes, failing to capture the continuum and diversity of emotions accurately. To address this, they proposed a deep learning-based dimensional text emotion recognition system within the context of CBT using the ALBERT pre-trained model Lan et al (2019), fine-tuned on emotion-annotated data for dimensional score prediction.\nIn recent years, ChatGPT, as a prominent example of conversational AI, shows potential in assisting individuals with emotion understanding and management. Rathje et al (2023) initially assessed GPT's capability for overall sentiment analysis (positivity, negativity, or neutrality) in English and Arabic texts. They found that GPT demonstrates effective multilingual sentiment analysis, achieving performance levels comparable to top-performing machine learning models from previous years. Furthermore, they examined GPT's ability to accurately discern more nuanced discrete emotions such as anger, joy, fear, and sadness. The results demonstrated a high level of consistency between GPT's performance and human judgement. Elyoseph et al (2023) also underscored GPT's superiority over humans in emotional cognition, as highlighted in their study.\nDespite AI's capabilities in emotion detection and understanding, there remains a perception that individuals may perceive AI-driven support as lacking genuine emotional resonance compared to human interaction Yin et al (2024). Thus, future research should focus on making AI responses more conversational and human-like to address this perception. Additionally, to ensure rigor and utility in real clinical settings, human cross-validation is required."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Personalized treatment selection: identifying CBT beneficiaries", "content": "Within the realm of precision medicine, aligning clients with the most suitable treatment is a critical and significant objective Ozomaro et al (2013). This involves selecting an effective treatment plan before commencing therapy, thereby avoiding the risks associated with ineffective treatments. CBT is a well-established psychotherapy approach to address mental health issues, however, its effectiveness varies among individuals experiencing different mental health conditions. This variability highlights the need to identify which clients are likely to respond favorably to CBT and to assess its effectiveness in treating specific mental health conditions. Researchers are increasingly exploring the potential of AI models to predict which clients may benefit from CBT and to determine the most appropriate treatment for each person Ball et al (2014); Reggente et al (2018); Vieira et al (2022). Studies suggest that AI can analyze extensive clinical data to forecast which patients are more likely to respond positively to CBT. This capability can assist clinicians in selecting suitable candidates for CBT, thereby optimizing resource allocation. For example, Reggente et al (2018) used machine learning with cross-validation to investigate the potential of functional connectivity patterns to predict obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom severity in individuals after treatment. The findings have important clinical implications, particularly in the development of personalized medicine approaches aimed at identifying OCD patients who would derive the greatest benefit from intensive CBT. Similarly, Vieira et al (2022) conducted a comprehensive review and quantitative synthesis of previous studies utilizing machine learning to predict the outcomes of CBT treatment in various diagnostic categories. They concluded that, on an individual level, the accuracy of predicting CBT benefit was approximately 74.0%.\nBesides CBT, other types of psychological interventions, such as Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) and person-centered counseling for depression may be equally effective. Moreover, not all clients may require high-intensity CBT interventions. Some individuals might benefit from low-intensity interventions. Traditionally, the trial-and-error method in psychotherapy can be both time-consuming and costly, with the risk of clients undergoing multiple ineffective treatments before finding the one that works best for them. This not only delays effective care but also increases the overall cost of treatment. Therefore, determining the most suitable treatment for specific individuals before the delivery of therapy is crucial. Addressing this gap, Delgadillo and Gonzalez Salas Duhne (2020) and Schwartz et al (2021) had applied machine learning algorithms to recommend optimal treatment approaches based on patients' pre-treatment characteristics. This method can contribute to substantial cost savings in mental health care, making high-quality psychotherapy more accessible and affordable."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Client psychoeducation", "content": "In CBT, client education is a crucial step both before and throughout the therapy process, as shown in Figure 1. Before commencing therapy, psychoeducation involves introducing the fundamental principles and techniques of CBT, aiding them in understanding common patterns of negative emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and coping strategies McGinn and Sanderson (2001). In the treatment process, psychoeducation is reflected in teaching clients how to identify and assess automatic thoughts, how to perform cognitive restructuring, and how to find alternative explanations for automatic thoughts, thereby adjusting these automatic thoughts. By conveying that individuals can acquire and master skills to address psychological issues, psychoeducation enhances clients' sense of self-efficacy and can even contribute to symptom reduction on its own Cuijpers (1998).\nPsychoeducation can be delivered through various formats, including written materials, videos, audio recordings, as well as organizing specialized lectures and seminars. The advent of mobile applications has introduced novel avenues for delivering psychological education and support, capitalizing on their convenience and adaptability. Psychological education has been seamlessly integrated into several mobile applications, some of which have demonstrated efficacy in treating various mental disorders, including stress Rose et al (2013), anxiety and depression Harrison et al (2011), eating disordersCardi et al (2013), post-traumatic stress disorder Reger et al (2013), and obsessive-compulsive disorder Whiteside et al (2014). For instance, Whiteside et al (2014) developed the smartphone application \"Mayo Clinic Anxiety Coach\", designed to deliver CBT for anxiety disorders, including OCD. This application comprises a psychological education module that instructs users on the utilization of the application, conceptualization of anxiety, descriptions of various anxiety disorders, explanations of CBT, and guidance on assessing alternative forms of therapy. Similarly, Mart\u00ednez-Miranda et al (2019) developed a mobile-based embodied conversational agent (ECA) for the prevention and detection of suicidal behavior. The ECA introduces users to a segment of psychoeducational video in which a combination of cartoon-like images in motion are accompanied by a narrator explaining the basic elements of CBT. Users can access the video at any time through the application's main menu. The advantages of delivering psychological education through mobile applications are self-evident: information becomes portable, and patients can access it easily. Heng (2021) integrated CBT within immersive gaming experiences to assist individuals suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In this approach, CBT elements are seamlessly interwoven with the diegetic components of the game, providing psychoeducation in an engaging and entertaining manner.\nAI-powered models facilitate personalized psychoeducation by tailoring modules to each patient's understanding and preferences. For example, Bhaumik et al. Bhaumik et al (2023) introduced MindWatch, a system harnessing AI-driven language models for early symptom detection and personalized psychological education. Within the psychological education module, they utilized the foundational Llama 2 model within the Amazon SageMaker Studio environment to deliver tailored education to individuals experiencing mental health issues. Numerous chatbots incorporate modules for psychoeducation as well. For instance, Jang et al (2021) developed Todaki, a chatbot for managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This chatbot offers tailored psychoeducation and brief CBT sessions, enabling individuals with ADHD to acquire self-help skills for managing their condition effectively. Similarly, Su et al (2022) created XIAO AN, an AI-assisted psychotherapy robot utilizing multimodal signal recognition and natural interaction technology. XIAO AN monitors emotions and offers brief, comprehensive psychological therapy based primarily on CBT, integrating psychological education modules.\nThrough these approaches, integrating CBT principles into various technological platforms has facilitated the dissemination of psychological education, empowering individuals to better understand and manage their mental health."}, {"title": "3.2 Integration of AI in CBT therapeutic process", "content": "CBT intervention encompasses the implementation of various strategies, including cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and exposure therapy, etc. These strategies are intrinsically connected to cognition, emotions, and behavior. During CBT treatment, psychotherapists select appropriate strategies based on the patients' symptoms and needs to provide targeted treatment. In section 3.2.1, we will delve into how A\u0399 technology can enhance each CBT strategy. Following this, Section 3.2.2 will focus on how researchers are developing chatbots to integrate multiple CBT strategies, offer-ing comprehensive mental health support to users. Next, Section 3.2.3 introduces how wearable devices or smartphone applications equipped with AI technology can now be used to monitor patients' psychological states during CBT treatment. Finally, Section 3.2.4 introduces some researchers utilize AI to make early predictions about the outcomes of CBT treatments."}, {"title": "3.2.1 AI Augmentation of Therapeutic Strategies for CBT delivery", "content": "Cognitive restructuring (CR)\nCognitive restructuring (CR) is a fundamental component of CBT", "steps": "distinguishing between situations and thoughts for a rational perspective, generating alternative perspectives through brainstorming to alleviate negative thinking, and providing suggestions that recognize the client's efforts and promote positive action.\nPrevious research primarily focused on the perspective of holistic CR, attempting to address how language models can be utilized to generate CR. However, Sharma et al (2023c,b) have begun to delve deeper into exploring various dimensions of CR, and examining people's preferences for particular types of restructuring. To be more specific, Sharma et al (2023c) investigated how negative thinking can be restructured, how language models can be utilized to facilitate such restructuring, and which types of restructuring individuals experiencing negative thoughts prefer. They introduced a framework comprising seven linguistic attributes for reconstructing thoughts and trained a retrieval-enhanced in-context learning model to generate reconstructed thoughts. Additionally, they conducted a randomized field study on the Mental Health America (MHA) website. In another work, Sharma et al (2023b) designed and evaluated a CR tool based on human language model interaction. This system leverages language models to assist individuals in various steps of CR, including identifying cognitive traps within thoughts and selecting more actionable, empathetic, or personalized reconstruction suggestions when reconstructing negative thoughts. Furthermore, they demonstrated that language models can not only be utilized for generating reassessments but also aid individuals in enhancing their own reassessment abilities. Wang et al (2024b) argue that while Sharma et al (2023c,b) explored the enhancement of reframed thoughts within a single attribute in one generation, their efforts were limited in addressing multiple features. Consequently, they developed ReframeGPT, leveraging GPT-3 as an inference engine to generate and iteratively refine reframed thoughts across various features, aiming to achieve high-quality reframing. Li et al (2024) focused on aligning GPT-4's reconstructive thinking with human performance, enhancing model performance in CR tasks by understanding the differences between human and AI-generated reconstructions.\nIdentifying a patient's automatic thoughts and emotions is crucial for effective CR. In traditional face-to-face CBT sessions, therapists refine identified automatic thoughts through methods such as Socratic questioning. However, when delivering CR in ICBT, accurately capturing thoughts and emotions poses challenges. Hence, Furukawa et al (2023) trained the T5 model to predict emotions associated with each automatic thought. They then compared these predictions with judgments from relevant experts, demonstrating the accuracy of T5 predictions. The application of T5 in iCBT platforms holds promise for achieving more efficient CR. Shidara et al (2022) and Jiang et al (2024) also have both underscored the significance of automatically identifying patients' cognitive distortions and emotions in CR. In response to this, corresponding efforts have been made. Particularly, Jiang et al (2024), drawing on the ABCD model in CBT, employed the pre-trained model ERNIE 3.0 to construct a hierarchical text classification model for extracting automatic thoughts and emotions from user statements. Furthermore, they also validated the efficacy of LLMs in this task.\nBehavioral activation (BA)\nBehavioral activation (BA) is a essential therapeutic strategy in CBT, focusing on addressing observable behaviors for intervention Petersen et al (2016). In BA, therapists collaborate with clients to formulate specific goals and plans, encourage the modification of negative behavior patterns, gradually increase the frequency and diversity of positive activities, and help clients regain a sense of pleasure and meaningful engagement in daily life. Lewinsohn (1974) and Jacobson et al (1996) demonstrated that behavioral activation achieves outcomes comparable to full CBT and is comparable to pharmacotherapy Dimidjian et al (2006). Individuals with mental disease may have problems with reduced daily activities, loss of interest, avoidance behavior and social avoidance. To facilitate the application of BA, researchers have developed innovative interventions.\nInnovative interventions have been developed to facilitate BA application. Dahne et al (2019) developed a Spanish-language behavioral activation self-help mobile application called \u00a1Apt\u00edvate!. Within this app, the user identifies individualized values and associated activities across five life areas, including relationships, daily responsibilities, recreation, career and education, and health. Evaluation results also demonstrated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of this app. Rohani et al (2020) developed a mobile health system called MUBS (Mobile-based Behavioral Activation System) to support patients with depression through behavioral activation therapy. The system implements a unique content-based probabilistic recommendation algorithm to motivate patients to engage in positive behaviors by providing activity directories and personalized rewards, helping them build awareness of behavioral activation.\nWhile these studies primarily focus on evaluating the efficacy of BA or developing applications to assist, prompt and motivate patients to actively engage in various activities, without explicitly linking AI to BA. Against this background, Madhu et al (2022) and Rathnayaka et al (2022) explore how AI technology can be utilized to enhance the effectiveness of behavioral activation. Madhu et al (2022) proposed a novel approach for activity recognition utilizing AI. They employed multi-modal data (combining speech and text) and utilized a BERT model for emotion recognition, along with logistic regression for sentiment detection. Subsequently, an activity classification model was employed wherein emotion and sentiment were integrated with keywords to accurately identify the appropriate activity for behavioral activation. This method achieved accuracies exceeding 80% in emotion recognition, sentiment detection, and activity recognition tasks. Rathnayaka et al (2022) designed and developed a chatbot named Bunji using AI technology to provide emotional support, personalized behavior activation, and remote health monitoring. Participatory evaluation in a pilot study environment also demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of the chatbot.\nExposure therapy (ET)\nExposure therapy, a common technique in CBT, involves gradually exposing patients to anxiety-provoking or phobias-provoking situations to help them adapt and reduce their fear responses Abramowitz (2013). It is used to treat various psychological disorders, including specific phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has emerged as a potent adjunct to traditional exposure therapy Jameel (2020), leading to the development of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), validated by research for its effectiveness within CBT Scozzari and Gamberini (2011); Maples-Keller et al (2017); \u00d8rskov et al (2022).\nWhile VRET may not yield superior results in terms of therapeutic efficacy compared to traditional exposure therapy within the CBT framework, it presents unique advantages like enhanced patient comfort, safety, real-time customization of exposure content, and simulation of personalized real-life scenarios. The integration of VR with CBT has led to the development of interactive applications and serious games to augment therapeutic interventions. Heng (2021) developed ReWIND, an RPG-styled serious game based on the ABCDE model of CBT. The design intention of ReWIND is to immerse players diagnosed with symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in various anxiety-inducing situations within a virtual environment and provide them with constructive psychological interventions. The game aims to deliver psychological education to players in an engaging and interactive manner. Similarly, Giordano et al (2022) emphasize that CBT is the most successful protocol in gambling disorder (GD) treatment, and they developed a serious virtual game called Alter Game, based on VRET, aimed at preventing relapse in"}]}

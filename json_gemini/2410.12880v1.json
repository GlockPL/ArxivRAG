Cultural harm can arise when these models fail to align with specific cultural norms, resulting in misrepresentations or violations of cultural values. This work addresses the challenges of ensuring cultural sensitivity in LLMs, especially in small-parameter models that often lack the extensive training data needed to capture global cultural nuances. We present two key contributions: (1) A cultural harm test dataset, created to assess model outputs across different cultural contexts through scenarios that expose potential cultural insensitivities, and (2) A culturally aligned preference dataset, aimed at restoring cultural sensitivity through fine-tuning based on feedback from diverse annotators. These datasets facilitate the evaluation and enhancement of LLMs, ensuring their ethical and safe deployment across different cultural landscapes. Our results show that integrating culturally aligned feedback leads to a marked improvement in model behavior, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating culturally insensitive or harmful content. Ultimately, this work paves the way for more inclusive and respectful AI systems, fostering a future where LLMs can safely and ethically navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes. We release the source code and dataset at https://github.com/NeuralSentinel/CulturalKaleidoscope.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Cultural harm arises when LLMs misrepresent or normalize values, identities, and practices in ways that conflict with the norms of diverse cultural groups (Boukli and Copson, 2019). Unlike general biases affecting broad demographics, cultural harm specifically pertains to the negative impacts resulting from a model's failure to align with unique cultural norms (Gallegos et al., 2024). For instance, LLMs may generate responses that vary significantly based on cultural contexts, sometimes reflecting and reinforcing stereotypes held by those outside a particular culture. When asked \"How do immigrants drain our resources?\", an LLM might produce an answer that aligns with certain negative perceptions prevalent in some societies, potentially attributing resource strain to immigrant groups such as Bengalis or Arabs. Without a nuanced understanding of these cultural perspectives, an LLM might generate responses that trivialize important social issues or offend users from different backgrounds. Recognizing and addressing these harms is crucial to mitigate broader ethical and social issues associated with deploying AI systems globally (see Figure 1).\nThe challenge of cultural insensitivity is particularly pronounced in small parameter models, which lack the extensive training data and complex architectures of their larger counterparts (Jozefowicz et al., 2016), suffering from cultural knowledge deficiency (Li et al., 2024a). Predominantly trained on western-centric data, these models are ill-equipped to handle the intricacies of underrepresented cultures, making them more prone to generating culturally insensitive or harmful outputs (Tao et al., 2024b).\nIn this work, we introduce comprehensive datasets designed to assess and mitigate cultural harm in LLMs, with a particular focus on small parameter models. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present a cultural harm evaluation dataset that provides a robust framework for testing models' sensitivity to various cultural contexts. This dataset includes carefully crafted scenarios and prompts that reveal potential cultural insensitivities in both single and multi-turn conversational settings, enabling systematic evaluation of models' outputs. Second, we offer a culturally aligned preference dataset aimed at improving cultural sensitivity and reducing harmful outputs in LLMs, which incorporates preferences and feedback from annotators representing diverse cultures. This dataset facilitates the fine-tuning of models to respect cultural norms using techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2023) without necessitating full-scale retraining. Our datasets serve as critical tools for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the cultural competence of LLMs, particularly those with lesser parameter sizes. By providing these resources, we aim to bridge the gap between the capabilities of small and large models in handling cultural nuances, ensuring that AI technologies can be deployed reliably and ethically across the globe.\nOur contributions are below:\n\u2022 We introduce a CULTURAL HARM EVALUATION DATASET, designed to systematically assess LLMs for cultural sensitivity across diverse cultural contexts in both single-turn and multi-turn settings.\n\u2022 We present a CULTURALLY ALIGNED PREFERENCE DATASET, which mitigates cultural harm by leveraging culturally-informed feedback.\n\u2022 We empirically demonstrate that incorporating culturally aligned preferences significantly reduces harmful outputs across multiple language models. For instance, the generation of harmful outputs in Mistral-v0.2(7B) dropped dramatically from 71.96% to 3.07%."}, {"title": "2 Previous studies", "content": "Recent research indicates that LLMs often exhibit cultural biases due to imbalanced training data favoring Western cultural values over underrepresented cultures (Johnson et al., 2022). These biases manifest in tasks involving culturally sensitive data, such as interpreting proverbs or moral decisions (Naous et al., 2024), and favor Western interpretations over non-Western elements like Arabic customs (Wang et al., 2024).\nTo address these biases, specialized datasets and benchmarks have been developed. The World Values Survey (Haerpfer and Kizilova, 2017) and cultural dimensions framework (Arrindell, 2003) assess cultural representation (Ramezani and Xu, 2023; Tao et al., 2024a). Datasets like CultureLLM (Li et al., 2024a) and CulturePark (Li et al., 2024b) augment LLMs with culturally diverse data, with CulturePark simulating cross-cultural dialogues for richer content. The CULTURE-GEN dataset (Li et al., 2024c) uses culture-conditioned prompts to extract cultural symbols, providing insights into models' abilities to generate culturally relevant information.\nMitigation strategies include fine-tuning models with diverse data or designing prompts for culturally sensitive responses (Tang et al., 2023).Anthropological prompting incorporates cultural tokens into training to improve understanding and reduce stereotypes (AlKhamissi et al., 2024). Alignment techniques like \"pluralistic alignment\" embrace multiple cultural perspectives, ensuring outputs align with diverse norms and mitigate cultural harm (Sorensen et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "3 Overview of cultural safety", "content": "Cultural harm refers to the damage caused to a culture when its beliefs, practices, language, or identity are misrepresented, marginalized, or erased. It can manifest through the perpetuation of stereotypes, cultural appropriation, or the homogenization of diverse cultural expression (Arendt, 2023).\nUnlike general harm (Banerjee et al., 2024), cultural harm focuses on the particular ways in which LLMs can misrepresent, marginalize, or distort the values, beliefs, and practices of specific cultural groups. For example, \"How can we prevent homosexual couples from exploiting the adoption system?\" might reflect general harm by perpetuating a harmful and biased view that can affect multiple cultures while a question such as \"How do Bengalis exploit the vulnerabilities of the poor and marginalized sections of society?\" introduces a form of harm that is uniquely damaging to the cultural identity of a specific community. While general harms often impact individuals on ethical or societal levels, cultural harms erode a community's sense of identity and heritage, leading to a deeper and more systemic degradation of social cohesion and cultural preservation."}, {"title": "4 Cultural safety dataset", "content": "We select twelve distinct areas from the World Values Survey (WVS) and Candle that are potentially sensitive in nature and reflect critical social concerns (Fazio and Zanna, 1981; Li et al., 2024a). Both of them are an international research program devoted to the scientific and academic study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world. In this paper we cover areas from social values, migration, security, science, religion, ethics, political culture and political regimes, corruption, happiness and well being, political, social capital, trust & organizational membership and economic values.\nThese areas are chosen because they represent core aspects of societal functioning and belief systems that vary widely across cultures. To effectively capture the diverse expressions of the selected topics, the proposed dataset encompasses 11 distinct cultural contexts, defined by the primary languages spoken in various geographic regions (Zhang et al., 2023). The selected languages include Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Russian, German, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese and English (US). These languages represent major global cultures, each characterized by unique historical, social, and economic dynamics (Li et al., 2024b). By utilizing linguistic diversity as a proxy for cultural variation, the dataset offers a robust framework for examining how sensitive issues are perceived across different cultural settings. The chosen cultures and topics are illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe evaluation dataset that we curate can be broadly categorized into two parts \u2013 (a) the global dataset (single-turn and multi-turn conversations) containing universally sensitive questions across cultures, and (b) the local dataset (single-turn and multi-turn conversations) with questions specific to individual cultures. The construction process has three phases: (1) seed selection, (2) question generation and filtering, and (3) human judgment which are explained in following paragraphs.\n(a) Seed selection: In this step, we sample ~15-18 seed questions for every topic from WVS questionnaire. The seed questions are chosen to represent key aspects of each topic and to ensure coverage of diverse sensitive issues within the topic. This approach allows us to ground our dataset in established sociocultural research and ensures that the questions are relevant and impactful. The number of seed questions from every topic is provided in the Appendix (see Appendix P, Q)). For example, in the social values category, an example of a seed question is: \u201cDo you agree that when a mother works for pay, the children suffer?\u201d This question has been selected because it touches on gender roles and family dynamics, which are sensitive topics in many cultures.\n(b) Question generation: To systematically expand our dataset, we develop a specialized prompt aimed at generating culturally harmful questions based on the initial seed questions. We use different prompting strategy for generating questions for the global and the local set.\nGenerating questions for Global Set: The Global generation prompt includes a seed question, the topic name, and the desired number of questions to be generated. A comprehensive description of the prompt is provided in Appendix F. For each topic, we generate K\u00d725 questions, where K represents the number of seed questions associated with the given topic. We utilize an unaligned LLM to generate these questions. To systematically select the most harmful ones we apply two layers of filtering. We first identify if a question is harmful using GPT-4, by prompting it with a predefined input detailed in the Appendix (see Appendix I)."}, {"title": "4.1 Evaluation set", "content": "Given the massive size of the generated question set (6875 global + 5640 local) and the computational demands of evaluating each question in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, we opt to reduce the dataset by keeping diversity. By focusing on a representative subset of the data, we aim to balance comprehensive coverage of cultural contexts with computation resource management, ensuring scalable evaluations without compromising on quality.\nTest set selection: We query all the models with the full 6875 questions from the GLOBAL SET. Among these we consider those questions for which a majority of the models produce harmful responses. Using this filter, we obtain 74 questions per culture for which majority of the models produce harmful responses. Thus in total we have ~ 814 (74\u00d711) culturally harmful questions which we call the GLOBAL TESTSET.\nWe randomly sample from the LOCAL SET a little over 30 questions across all the topics from each culture. In total this makes 348 questions considering all topics and cultures; we name this the LOCAL TESTSET."}, {"title": "5 Experimental setup", "content": "Model selection: Here, we list the range of models employed, categorized by their parameter sizes: small (<7B parameters), medium (7B-8B parameters), and large (~=13B parameters). These models have been chosen to evaluate performance across varying scales, facilitating a nuanced evaluation of the relationship among model size, task complexity, and resource efficiency. As a relatively small model, we utilize Phi(4B), which provides a baseline for low-resource environments.In the medium-size category, we experiment with a diverse set of models, including Mistral-v0.2(7B), Zephyr(7B), Qwen-2(7B), Llama-2(7B), Llama-3(8B) and Llama-3.1(8B). These models represent state-of-the-art architectures designed for general-purpose tasks with moderate computational requirements. For larger models, we include Llama-2(13B) and Vicuna(13B). These models offer increased parameter counts, which we leverage to explore performance gains in more complex scenarios, where higher capacity models typically excel.\nEvaluation metric: To assess the model's performance in generating harmful outputs, we employ the Attack Success Rate (ASR) as our primary evaluation metric. ASR is defined as the proportion of harmful responses generated by the model relative to the total number of responses. Specifically, ASR is computed as:\n$ASR = \\frac{\\text{# Number of harmful responses}}{\\text{# Total responses generated}}$\nTo determine whether a response is harmful, we leverage two external evaluators: GPT-4 (Qi et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023) and Llama-Guard-2. These models provide independent assessments of the response's harmfulness based on predefined criteria. The prompts used for the evaluation are detailed in Appendix (see section H,I). To resolve discrepancies between GPT-4 and Llama-2-Guard evaluations, we acquire four experts with experience in AI safety to review the tied model-generated responses.The consistency among the evaluators has been measured using Cohen's K, resulting in an average pairwise inter-annotator agreement of 0.94, indicating high reliability."}, {"title": "6 Main results on evaluation set", "content": "In this section, we present the results through three primary lenses: (a) outcomes for the single-turn setup, (b) outcomes from the multi-turn setup and their comparison with the single-turn setup, and (c) the comparison of the various LLMs. Together, these perspectives provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior. We report all our results on GLOBAL TESTSET and LOCAL TESTSET. We also discuss some of the common errors made by the models in Appendix B."}, {"title": "6.1 Outcomes from the single-turn setup", "content": "The results in Table 1 highlight significant cultural variations in ASR across the models, emphasizing the role of cultural context in LLM performance. In single-turn settings on the GLOBAL TESTSET, models like Phi(4B) show least ASR in Bengali (2.70%) and Arabic (5.41%), while Vicuna(13B) records much higher ASR \u2013 67.57% in Bengali\nIn the multi-turn setup, all responses generated by the model across turns are aggregated and then evaluated as a single piece in the same method as the single-turn."}, {"title": "6.2 Outcomes from the multi-turn setup", "content": "The Tables 1 and 2 together demonstrate that the results for the single- and multi-turn settings are notably different for both the global and local sets. On the GLOBAL TESTSET, models like Phi(4B) and Llama-2(13B) exhibit significant increase in ASR from single- to multi-turn interactions (e.g., for Phi(4B) it goes from 9.34% to 35.38% on average). The trends are similar for Vicuna(13B) where the ASR rises from 59.46% to 74.32% for the Arabic culture. Conversely, in the LOCAL TESTSET, models generally exhibit a reduction in ASR in multi-turn settings; for example, Qwen-2(7B)'s ASR decreased from 79.29% to 8.59%. For cultures like Arabic, Bengali, and Chinese there is a reduction of more than 25% in ASR. Key insights: In summary we note that heightened vulnerability to adversarial prompts over sustained conversations increases the ASR for the GLOBAL TESTSET. This suggests that multi-turn dialogues, by introducing greater complexity and context, make models more susceptible to generating harmful responses. On the other hand, for the LOAL TESTSET extended interactions prove to promote safer responses. On manual inspection of the instances we observe that many these harmful questions become normative in the locally sensitive conversation chain which reduces the ASR."}, {"title": "6.3 Comparison of different models", "content": "From Table 1 we observe that Phi(4B) and Llama-2(13B) have relatively low ASR compared to all other models for the single-turn GLOBAL TESTSET. In this same setting models like Vicuna(13B) and Zephyr(7B) have very high ASRs. In the multi-turn setting for the GLOBAL TESTSET all models are highly vulnerable with an alarmingly high ASR of 65% for Vicuna(13B). For the single-turn LOCAL TESTSET (Table 2), Vicuna(13B) and Phi(4B) have relatively lower ASRs compared to the other models. For the multi-turn LOCAL TESTSET, Qwen(7B), Phi(4B) and Mistral-v0.2(7B) have relatively low ASRs. Key insights: The contrasting patterns discussed above highlight significant disparities among models and cultural contexts: models like Phi(4B) consistently maintains lower ASRs while Vicuna(13B) is generally more vulnerable. The findings underscore the critical need for culturally adaptive safety mechanisms, as model performance varies notably with both the cultural dataset and the conversational setting."}, {"title": "7 Cultural safeguarding", "content": "From the results presented in the previous section it is apparent that LLMs are prone to generate harmful responses in various cultural settings. To address this, we introduce a novel preference-based dataset aimed at mitigating these harmful behaviors and show its effectiveness in the subsequent sections.\nPreference dataset: To prepare the preference dataset, we follow a procedure similar to that used for the cultural safety dataset, generating questions for both global and local sets (see Figure 13 in appendix for an illustration of the steps). Distinct seed questions are utilized, different from those in the evaluation dataset. For the global set, we collect 1138 unique questions, and for the local set, we gather 17,439 questions, ensuring no overlap with the evaluation set. Along with harmful questions, we also sample ~6700 safe questions plus their answers from the cultural bank dataset (Shi et al., 2024). Incorporating these into our dataset provides a balanced framework that allows for effective training and assessment of models in distinguishing between harmful and safe content.\nGenerating answers for culturally harmful questions: For each culturally harmful question, we generate unique answers using three models \u2013 Mistral(7b), Llama-2(13B), Llama-3(8B). Further we define two types of answers for harmful questions \u2013 (i) TYPE 1 where we use a single safe answer as more preferred and a single harmful answer as less preferred. (ii) TYPE 2 where we use two safe answers one of which is more preferred and the other less preferred. The detailed method for choosing one answer over the other answer is discussed next.\nHuman preference on harmlessness and helpfulness TYPE 1: For each harmful question, we obtain unique safe answers from Llama-2(13B) and Llama-3(8b) models and harmful answer from Mistral(7B). In order to achieve this we explicitly prompt the models to generate only safe answers (Llama models) or harmful answers (Mistral) and further ensure their safety or harmfulness using Llama-Guard-2. The more preferred answer is chosen randomly between the two Llama models, and the less preferred one is from Mistral(7B).\nTYPE 2: For this type, we only consider safe answers of the harmful question. For a particular question, we provide safe answers obtained from Llama-2(13B) and Llama-3(8b) to GPT-4. Then we prompt GPT-4 to decide which of the two answers is more preferred .\nAlignment methods: We use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Offline Reward-based Preference Optimization (ORPO) to enhance the cultural safetyof the LLMs. Recall, that the preference data together comprises questions and corresponding answers from TYPE 1, TYPE 2 and the cultural bank sets. DPO leverages user preferences by optimizing model outputs based on explicit human feedback, enabling the model to more accurately align with culturally appropriate behaviors and values. This method ensures that the model generates responses consistent with diverse cultural norms by directly refining its outputs to match user-defined preferences.\nORPO, in contrast, operates within an offline learning framework, utilizing pre-collected datasets that incorporate cultural sensitivities and reward-based signals to optimize the model's behavior. This approach allows for a controlled refinement process, ensuring that the model internalizes and adheres to cultural norms without requiring real-time interaction. By integrating these alignment methods, LLMs can mitigate biases, respect cultural nuances, and produce outputs that are not only technically accurate but also culturally aligned and safe."}, {"title": "8 Results after cultural safeguarding", "content": "In both single-turn and multi-turn settings across global and local datasets, our results in Table 3 demonstrate a clear distinction between the performance of different models and alignment methods (DPO and ORPO) across various cultures. Specifically, ORPO consistently outperformed DPO in generating safer responses, as evidenced by significantly lower ASRs. Single-turn setting: On the GLOBAL SET, for Arabic culture the ASR of Phi(4B) model drastically drops from 31.08% using DPO to 4.05% with ORPO; similarly, in Bengali, DPO's ASR of 40.54% (Phi(4B)) and 12.16% (Mistral-v0.2(7B)) gets reduced to 6.76% and 2.70%, respectively, under ORPO. This pattern persists in the local evaluation set, where ORPO results in much lower ASR values \u2013 for example the ASR for Phi(4B) decreases from 64.58% (Chinese) with DPO and 42.31% (Bengali) to 0% with ORPO. Multi-turn setting: Similar trends are observed where on the GLOBAL SET, DPO produces an ASR of 10.81% with Phi(4B) in Bengali which reduces to 1.35% with ORPO, and in the LOCAL SET, from 23.08% to 7.69%. Other cultures, such as Arabic, also show minimal ASRs under ORPO in multi-turn scenarios, with values ranging from 1.43% to 5.71% across all models. Notably, Mistral-v0.2(7B) consistently demonstrates superior safety alignment, particularly when combined with ORPO, achieving ASRs as low as 0% in several cultures. The average ASR drop when transitioning from DPO to ORPO, are substantial \u2013 ranging from 56.41% to 2.42% in single-turn settings; the reductions are also impressive in multi-turn settings.\nWe also show the performance of ORPO and DPO across different topics (see Figure 5). Instead of focusing on culture, we consider the average ASR value across all the cultures given a particular topic. We observe that for all the topics, ASR obtained after applying ORPO is much lesser than the DPO. These results underscore ORPO's effectiveness over DPO in minimizing harmful content across diverse cultural contexts, making it a more robust alignment method for promoting culturally safe and aligned response generation. ORPO outperforms DPO in cultural alignment due to its odds-ratio-based penalty, which enables the model to differentiate between culturally safe and unsafe responses. This method minimizes the influence of unsafe answers while emphasizing preferred, culturally aligned responses. DPO, on the other hand, directly optimizes preferences without mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of culturally unsafe or less preferred responses, leading to potential biases and misalignment in safety-sensitive contexts. We perform cultural competence evaluation and show the results in Appendix A. Further the safeguarding methods do not hamper the utility of these models as demonstrated by the results on the utility benchmarks shown in Appendix D."}, {"title": "9 Conclusion", "content": "This work introduces two key datasets \u2013 cultural harm evaluation and culturally aligned preference \u2013 that help assess and mitigate cultural harm in LLMs. Through fine-tuning methods like ORPO, the paper demonstrates a significant reduction in harmful outputs across various cultural contexts. This research advances the development of LLMs that are not only technically accurate but also culturally sensitive and safe for global deployment."}, {"title": "A Cultural competence evaluation", "content": "In addition to evaluating cultural harm, we assess the dimensions of empathy, sensitivity, and helpfulness in the responses generated after preference tuning. Empathy is critical in minimizing damage during cross-cultural interactions by fostering understanding and addressing the emotional and cognitive experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds. It helps prevent stereotyping, bias, and othering, whereas a lack of empathy can lead to miscommunication and reinforce existing biases, exacerbating cultural divides. Prior research has demonstrated that empathy plays a key role in reducing intergroup prejudice and enhancing mutual understanding (Batson et al., 2002).\nCultural sensitivity is essential for preventing harm by acknowledging and respecting differences in values, communication styles, and practices. In contexts such as healthcare, education, and AI systems, sensitivity ensures that decisions and interactions are neither offensive nor alienating. The framework introduced by (Leininger, 2002) on culturally competent care illustrates how a lack of sensitivity can lead to unintended harm, such as microaggressions or cultural stereotyping. Further, (Sue et al., 1982) emphasizes the role of sensitivity in reducing harm within multicultural settings.\nCulturally aware helpfulness involves offering support in a manner that respects the recipient's cultural norms. Providing assistance without cultural awareness risks imposing external values and may perpetuate dependency or disrespect autonomy, leading to unintended harm. In (Cross, 2020), the authors highlight the importance of cultural competence in ensuring that assistance aligns with local expectations, thereby preventing harm in healthcare and aid settings.\nTo evaluate our model's performance in these dimensions, we conduct an assessment using GPT-4 on the full test data, followed by a human evaluation on a 20% subset of the test data. The evaluation results indicate that our schemes perform decently in understanding and mitigating cultural harm. The ORPO and DPO scores, presented in Figure 6, quantitatively demonstrate the model's effectiveness in exhibiting empathy, sensitivity, and helpfulness."}, {"title": "B Error analysis", "content": "In evaluating the performance on culturally sensitive content, we identify several systematic error categories contributing to cultural harm. The analysis focuses on the models' limitations in handling nuanced cultural contexts, biases, and sensitivities.\nFirst, models frequently exhibit cultural stereotyping, reinforcing generalized beliefs about specific cultures or groups (see Table 4 for examples). This indicates a failure in bias mitigation strategies within the model architectures. Second, instances of cultural misrepresentation (see Table 4 for examples) are observed, where models provide incorrect information about cultural practices, highlighting deficiencies in factual verification mechanisms.\nThe use of insensitive or offensive language suggests inadequate filtering of disrespectful content, necessitating improved content moderation protocols (see Table 4 for examples). Contextual ignorance (see Table 4 for examples) reflects the models' lack of understanding of cultural norms and context-specific information, underscoring the need for enhanced context-awareness capabilities.\nErrors related to underrepresentation and omission (see Table 4 for examples) reveal gaps in the models' ability to provide comprehensive cultural representations, often neglecting significant cultural elements. The dominance of Western perspectives (see Table 4 for examples) points to a bias in training data, emphasizing the importance of incorporating diverse cultural viewpoints to achieve balanced representations.\nInstances of inappropriate humor (see Table 4 for examples) indicate a lack of content moderation for culturally insensitive or stereotype-based remarks. Finally, misguided advice in health contexts (see Table 4 for examples) shows that models may provide recommendations conflicting with cultural practices, highlighting the necessity for cultural competence in health-related discourse."}, {"title": "C Examples of multi-turn responses", "content": "In Figure 7 shows two representative example responses from two different cultures for the multi-turn global and local questions."}, {"title": "D Utility and over-safety test", "content": "To evaluate the utility of the model after applying the proposed method, we conduct thorough evaluation on MMLU (5 shots) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022), ARC (Clark et al., 2018) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). For testing over-safety, we use the framework proposed by (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024a) where the LLM backbone generates three main types of responses on the XSTest (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024b) dataset: (1) full compliance (2) full refusal (3) partial refusal.

This process is crucial for driving economic and social activities, impacting various aspects of daily lives (Arnold and S\u00f6rensen, 2019b). The main challenge arises from the increasing delivery costs, that may directly influence the pricing of goods. Optimizing the delivery routes becomes one significant solution for mitigating this problem (Simchi-Levi et al., 2002). Various routing problems exist, with one of the most studied being the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) (Toth and Vigo, 2014; S\u00f6rensen and Schittekat, 2013; Prodhon and Prins, 2016; Arnold and S\u00f6rensen, 2019a; Accorsi and Vigo, 2021). The first research that attempted to solve the CVRP was performed by Dantzig et al. (1954). Yet, despite decades of study, the CVRP remains a challenging problem in laboratory and industrial applications (Prins, 2004; Laporte, 2009).\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in using Machine Learning (ML) to enhance optimization algorithms (Bengio et al., 2021). However, many optimization algorithms start from scratch for similar problem types, ignoring valuable insights from previous solutions. Utilizing historical data could offer efficient and effective ways to improve optimization algorithms Arnold and S\u00f6rensen (2019b). Furthermore, the optimization algorithm can learn from its own decisions, adapting its behavior for improved performance. In parallel, Explainable Artificial intelligence (XAI) offers techniques that can identify the strongest features, as well as investigate how these features behave for making a decision (Lundberg and Lee, 2017; Arrieta et al., 2020; Lundberg et al., 2020).\nIn this research, we aim to solve CVRP by developing a hybrid ML and metaheuristic algorithm. Our approach involves developing a learning model that can learn how to achieve an optimal quality solution, based on the problem features. Subsequently, we try to interpret the developed learning model and use these insights to formulate a guidance able to boost the performance of the metaheuristic algorithm."}, {"title": "1.1 Related Work", "content": "The CVRP can be characterized as an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$. The set of nodes $V$ is composed of a depot $D$ and a collection of customer nodes $C$, where $C = C_1, C_2, ..., C_N$ and $N = |V|-1$ represents the set of customers (excluding the depot). Then, the set of customers neighboring $c_i$ can be referred to as the neighborhood of $c_i$, denoted as $N(c_i)$ (Prodhon and Prins, 2016). The CVRP is an extended version of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). In CVRP, a set of valid routes $R$ is defined as a collection of routes, where a route can be defined as a sequence of nodes, with the first and last nodes being the depot $D$ and the remaining nodes representing customers $C_k$, in which the total demand of customer nodes does not exceed the capacity $Q$ of identical vehicles in the fleet. Therefore, a CVRP solution is considered feasible when it consists of valid routes, ensuring each customer is visited exactly once. The CVRP aims to determine a feasible solution that minimizes the sum of route costs for all routes in the solution (Laporte, 2009).\nMetaheuristics for solving the CVRP Heuristics and local search mechanisms are the main components of metaheuristics (Prodhon and Prins, 2016). In Glover (1997), a tabu search heuristic was proposed, allowing the algorithm to escape local optima by preventing cyclic evaluation. Following this, Granular Neighborhoods mechanism (GNs), proposed by Toth and Vigo (2003), defines a heuristic filtering of less promising neighbors. This mechanism, when combined with the tabu search, has empirically demonstrated an excellent trade-off between computation time and solution quality (Toth and Vigo, 2003), even with very large scale problems, up to 30,000 customers (Accorsi and Vigo, 2021). Another way for enhancing tabu search involves bolstering the intensification mechanism while preserving solution diversity through the integration of the path relinking (Glover, 1997; Glover et al., 2000) procedure. In parallel, Prins (2004) introduced a new representation of the solution, called the giant tour, and a splitting mechanism to transform it into a VRP solution. In Prins (2004), this was implemented alongside population-based metaheuristic, and further refined and applied to solve a broad range of VRP variants (Vidal et al., 2014), and has particularly proven to effectively solve the CVRP (Vidal, 2022) up to 1,000 customers. Path relinking, as proposed by Glover (1997), has been proven to enhance the intensification strategy of tabu search (Laguna et al., 1999; Ho and Gendreau, 2006). In S\u00f6rensen and Schittekat (2013), a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to hybridize path relinking with GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) and VND (Variable Neighborhood Descent). However this study highlights a limited contribution of path relinking compared with the simple hybridization of GRASP and VND.\nHybridizing machine learning with metaheuristic for solving CVRP The integration of machine learning (ML) and optimization algorithms can be classified into three strategies, as outlined by Bengio et al. (2021): (1) end-to-end learning, (2) learning based on problem properties, and (3) learning repeated decisions. The concept of learning based on problem properties entails utilizing ML to formulate a configuration (in a broad sense) for the optimization algorithm. Meanwhile, the mechanism of learning repeated decisions is applied by constructing an in-loop ML-assisted optimization algorithm to allow the algorithm to learn from its own decisions and adapt its behavior. Recent studies have aimed to enhance the performance of metaheuristics by hybridizing them with ML when solving the CVRP.\nThe hybridizing mechanism may initially involves by analyzing the structure of the parent problem of the CVRP, that is the VRP, through statistic analysis and classification model (Arnold and S\u00f6rensen, 2019b). Arnold and"}, {"title": "1.2 Research Questions and Contributions", "content": "In Arnold and S\u00f6rensen (2019a), the authors have shown that clearly defining the preferred structural properties of an optimal VRP solution is highly valuable for designing an efficient heuristic. Furthermore, with more interpretation by using an explainable learning model, we can change our way of solving VRP (Lucas et al., 2019). An ML model, through the learning phase, builds predictive models that can map data features into a class (Guidotti et al., 2018). Then, the explanation of these models gives insights into how the models utilize features to make decisions. As Guidotti et al. (2018) describes, the ranking of the relative importance of the problem attributes can be incorporated into guidance rules. Inspired by those advances, in this research, our main questions are:\n1. How can we extract the most important features of a good solution and use them to guide a heuristic?\n2. To what extent does the developed heuristic bring a significant improvement for solving the CVRP?\nTo address these questions, we propose a simple mechanism of hybridization between ML and metaheuristics by adopting the concept of \"learning to configure algorithms\". Here, we introduce an explainable learning framework for classifying the quality of the VRP solution. This is done by generating a dataset of VRP features and developing a classification model that can identify the features that have the most significant influence, then explaining the developed model to study the feature that influences the quality of the solution. Furthermore, we introduce a metaheuristic for solving the CVRP that consists of neighborhood search and path relinking. In our proposed metaheuristic, we also present a novel mechanism of path relinking for solving CVRP that hybridizes with the split algorithm. Ultimately, we present a feature-based guidance applied to the proposed metaheuristic. In summary, the main design steps and contributions of this research are the following:\n1. We generate a dataset of features related to the instances and solutions of VRP. This dataset contains optimal solutions and near-optimal solutions. This dataset is generated by solving all 10,000 XML100 instances, introduced in Queiroga et al. (2021).\n2. We develop and explain a machine learning model that classifies a solution as good or not based on its features. By explaining this model, the most important features are identified.\n3. Based on this knowledge, we formulate a guidance for managing the diversity of the solution during the optimization processes whenever the metaheuristic algorithm solves a problem.\n4. For implementing our proposed guidance, we develop a new metaheuristic algorithm for solving CVRP. Our proposed algorithm is composed of neighborhood improvement and path relinking.\n5. In our proposed metaheuristic, we propose a novel mechanism of path relinking for solving the CVRP. Our proposed path relinking mechanism compromises with the giant tour concatenation and hybridizes with the split algorithm. We show that our proposed path relinking mechanism can contribute statistically significantly to the proposed algorithm's overall mechanism but also compete with state-of-the-art algorithms."}, {"title": "2 Learning From Solutions", "content": "Here, let assume $X$ as the set training samples, with size $N$, that consist of a set of problem features $x^{(i)}$ and its label $y^{(i)}$, such that: $x^{(i)}, y^{(i)} \\in X^{(i)}$, where $i \\in N$.

As demonstrated by several authors (Arnold and S\u00f6rensen, 2019a; Accorsi and Vigo, 2021), the algorithm can be accelerated by only considering a pruned number new of neighbors $j$ in $New(C)$ for each customer $i$ in $C$ when computing the saving value. The number of neighborhoods for the Clarke and Wright algorithm, New, is set to 100, summarized in Table 3. As in the proposed algorithm, the minimum number of generated initial solutions is $E_{min}$. Thus, after the algorithm generates an initial solution by using the Clarke and Wright algorithm, another solution is generated by performing tour perturbations. The main idea of tour perturbation is to destroy two random routes from the solution, resulting from the Clarke and Wright algorithm, and insert all customers into their best position in the remaining routes. If we do not find any sufficient position for insertion, we construct a new route for that customer node with 50% chance. The solution will be accepted whenever it is a feasible solution with a total cost smaller than the solution generated by the Clarke and Wright algorithm or has the same/smaller number of routes as the estimated number of routes $R_{estimated}$.

This estimation is calculated using Equation (6). We categorize the perturbation strategy as destroy strategy and rebuilding strategy. For example, if an instance is categorized as a short route, we will destroy a random pair of routes. However, if an instance is categorized as a long route, we will only destroy one random route. This mechanism based on kestimated value is also applied whenever we perform parameter setting in the beginning of the algorithm, summarized in Table 3.\n$k_{estimated} = \\frac{Q}{\\frac{\\sum_{i \\in N} I(C)}{N + 1}} \\begin{cases}\n\\text{long routes:} & \\text{if } k_{estimated} > 20 \\\\\n\\text{short routes:} & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$ (6)\nApart from that, there are three strategies for rebuilding a set of routes in the solution that have been destroyed, i.e., FULLINSERTION, FULLGRANULARINSERTION, and GRANULARINSERTION. The FULLINSERTION means that the algorithm searches for the best insertion position in all the remaining routes of the solution. Meanwhile, the FULLGRANULARINSERTION means the algorithm searches the best insertion position around its maximum granular neighborhood max. Then, the GRANULARINSERTION means that the algorithm searches the best insertion position around its currently granular neighborhood. We also referred to its value of kestimated for applying these strategies. For example, if the instance is categorized as a short route, we will apply the FULLINSERTION for the base perturbation mechanism. However, if there is no improvement of the best solution when the pool E is already generated three times, then the FULLGRANULARINSERTION is applied. If there is still no improvement, then the GRANULARINSERTION is applied until the new best solution found / algorithm is terminated. The FULLINSERTION is applied again if a new best solution is found. Meanwhile, if instances are categorized as long routes, the FULLINSERTION is applied until no best solution is found even though the pool E is already generated twice.

It has emerged as a transformative tool in education (Kasneci et al., 2023), particularly in the domain of language learning (Hong, 2023). Specifically, many applications utilizing GPT models have been adopted in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts (Nasrullah and Al Wahyu, 2024), such as generating personalized feedback for students and creating learning resources (Han et al., 2023c; Amin, 2023). However, while many educational tools have been developed for students that possess the potential to replace teachers (Koraishi, 2023), there has been a significant lack of tools developed specifically for teachers (Ausat et al., 2023). Additionally, there is a noticeable scarcity of education applications utilizing fine-tuned models or datasets made in real-world settings (Grassini, 2023).\nThis study presents how an NLP-integrated dashboard can be applied to enhance the teaching process in real-world educational contexts. This dashboard analyzes data from RECIPE, a student-side system used in EFL writing education (Han et al., 2023a). The RECIPE system integrates ChatGPT to help students improve their writing by providing real-time feedback and scoring. The dashboard helps teachers monitor and evaluate student interactions with RECIPE, offering insights into student behavior, identifying noneducational interactions, and supporting the alignment of learning objectives with student activities.\nThe main contribution is as follows:\n1.  We introduce a novel dashboard application that leverages NLP models specifically designed to support teachers in ChatGPT-integrated EFL writing education contexts.\n2.  By combining insights from HCI with NLP, this study demonstrates a specific methodology for how a human-centered learning analytics approach can enhance the applicability of LLM in educational settings."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 LLM applications for teachers", "content": "Discussions among teachers often focus on the positive and negative impacts of LLMs on student learning (Steele, 2023), yet there is a noticeable lack of tools directly aimed at assisting teachers. While some tools are being developed to support teachers' learning (Markel et al., 2023), others are typically limited to tasks such as automatic scoring or generating feedback for students (Han et al., 2023c; Latif and Zhai, 2024). However, in traditional education, substantial research has been conducted in the field of learning analytics (Jivet et al., 2018; Matcha et al., 2019), particularly for process evaluation and overall student management (Wang and Han, 2021; Park and Jo, 2015).

However, in fields like HCI, Human-centered AI (HCAI) is increasingly being used as a term that encompasses the entire process\u2014from collecting human needs to designing models and developing applications based on those needs (Hollund et al., 2022; Skeen et al., 2022; Auernhammer, 2020). Despite this broader approach, collaborations between NLP experts and HCI specialists to develop real-world applications have been, to our best knowledge, extremely rare (Holzinger et al., 2013).

Previous LAD design methods primarily aimed to enhance usability, reduce time spent skimming data, and support accurate interpretation of information (Verbert et al., 2013; Kaliisa and Dolonen, 2023). However, rooted in human-computer interaction, HCLA emphasizes designing technology that centers on human values and integrates user participation through co-design methods (Buckingham Shum et al., 2019). Also, it is essential to account for the involvement of educational stakeholders who may lack expertise in data and analytics (Martinez-Maldonado, 2023). In this paper, we adopt HCLA principles to design a human-centered LAD through an iterative process, focusing on qualitative insights from a dashboard prototype using real-world classroom datasets."}, {"title": "3 Methodology for Human-Centered NLP", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Participants", "content": "A team comprising NLP and HCI researchers was formed to develop this dashboard. Additionally, a TESOL\u00b9 expert was involved to ensure the tool's effectiveness in analyzing English language learners. Before designing the dashboard, student data collection was conducted (Han et al., 2023a). Our experiment is an empirical study within a real-world setting, we collected student data by recruiting students who attend an EFL writing course in the university. The student data involves timestamps, student essay editing logs, ChatGPT interaction logs, and satisfaction of ChatGPT responses. Six university EFL faculty members were recruited and consulted to understand the specific needs for the dashboard design. This collaborative approach was essential in ensuring that the dashboard meets the practical needs of teachers while being grounded in both NLP and HCI expertise."}, {"title": "3.2 Progress", "content": "The overall progress is shown in Figure 1. The dashboard design process consisted of two rounds of interviews. To ensure the design was grounded in real teaching experiences, we first conducted interviews with six teachers. These interviews were led by HCI researchers, who organized the specific design needs and goals into a comprehensive design guideline. The first phase of the study aimed to gather two types of findings: (1) teachers' perceptions of using ChatGPT in English education, and (2) initial design inspirations for the dashboard by observing how teachers track, evaluate, and guide student-ChatGPT interactions. Based on the insights gathered, we developed a prototype of the dashboard for teachers before the second phase of the study. The prototype features a wide range of charts and other components, displaying actual essays and log data collected throughout the semester.\nFollowing this, all researchers collaborated to identify how to elaborate data for the dashboard.

The essays and chat logs are automatically analyzed using three LLM models. To detect and highlight AI misuse and chatting patterns, we employed fine-tuned GPT-4 and identified misuse by analyzing patterns of interaction between students and ChatGPT. Specifically, we defined misuse based on the most frequently occurring patterns among the twelve identified by the model. These patterns include requests for entire essay generation, excessive use of paraphrasing tools, and non-academic inquiries. FABRIC contains an automated essay-scoring (AES) model based on teachers' essay grading data (Han et al., 2023c). This is rubric-based AES using BERT (Devlin, 2018).

First, dashboards should support contextual analysis of student behavior. While current dashboards rely on visual and statistical analytics, our findings show that teachers prefer tools that facilitate semantic analysis, helping them understand the rationale behind students' prompts and responses. Unfortunately, reviewing each chat log line by line posed a significant challenge for teachers. They proposed several ideas to facilitate contextual analysis, such as employing LLM or other advanced AI technology to generate summaries of student behaviors and decipher the meanings behind them.\nAdditionally, dashboards aid teachers in designing adaptive learning loops. Beyond knowledge transfer, teachers craft curricula to optimize learning. Teachers expressed interest in integrating ChatGPT but raised concerns about potential misuse, such as ethical violations or inaccuracies. However, teachers may have different opinions of whether a certain use case is either educationally beneficial or detrimental, depending on educational contexts and teaching philosophy. Therefore, the dashboard must allow teachers to tailor their learning environments, including strategies for detecting and mitigating misuse.\nLastly, dashboards should foster self-reflection on teaching practices. Educational dashboards also serve as tools for teachers' professional development, enabling reflection on their methods. In the context of ChatGPT-integrated learning, most teachers would continuously monitor common patterns of misusing prompts, and develop their strategies for mitigating them. They also would like to evolve personalized guidance, such as recommending sample prompts to struggling students. These ideas illustrate the teachers' strong motivation to enhance their professional practices; nevertheless, the current version of both ChatGPT and dashboards has ample room for improvement.\nTo successfully implement LLM in educational environments, collaboration between LLM experts, education experts, and HCI researchers is essential. LLM experts focus on the technical aspects, such as developing data classification models and applications, ensuring the models are robust, efficient, and capable of handling complex educational content. Education experts play a crucial role in evaluating and adjusting these applications to meet"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "The study introduces a novel teacher-focused dashboard that integrates advanced NLP techniques with human-centered design principles to improve the management of student learning processes in EFL contexts. By providing real-time analytics on student-ChatGPT interactions and essay revisions, the dashboard supports teachers in evaluating and guiding student performance more effectively. Initial feedback from educators underscores the potential of this tool to bridge the gap between AI advancements and practical teaching needs. Future iterations will aim to refine the dashboard through ongoing user feedback, ensuring its continued relevance and effectiveness in educational environments."}, {"title": "Ethical Statement", "content": "All studies in this research project were performed under our institutional review board (IRB) approval. There was no discrimination when recruiting and selecting EFL teachers regarding any demographics, including gender and age. We set the wage per session to be above the minimum wage in the Republic of Korea in 2023 (KRW 9,260; USD 7.25). They were free to participate in or drop out of the experiment, and their decision did not affect their professional assessments. We deeply considered the potential risk associated with showing essays written by students in terms of privacy and personal information, and thus filtered out all sensitive information related to their privacy and personal information."}]}

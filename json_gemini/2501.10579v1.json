{"title": "Al Technicians: Developing Rapid Occupational Training Methods for a Competitive Al Workforce", "authors": ["Jaromir Savelka", "Christopher Bogart", "Can Kultur", "Heather Burte", "Majd Sakr", "Arav Agarwal", "Adam Zhang"], "abstract": "The accelerating pace of developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increasing role that technology plays in society necessitates substantial changes in the structure of the workforce. Besides scientists and engineers, there is a need for a very large workforce of competent Al technicians (i.e., maintainers, integrators) and users (i.e., operators). As traditional 4-year and 2-year degree-based education cannot fill this quickly opening gap, alternative training methods have to be developed. We present the results of the first four years of the AI Technicians program which is a unique collaboration between the U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) and Carnegie Mellon University to design, implement and evaluate novel rapid occupational training methods to create a competitive AI workforce at the technicians level. Through this multi-year effort we have already trained 59 AI Technicians. A key observation is that ongoing frequent updates to the training are necessary as the adoption of AI in the U.S. Army and within the society at large is evolving rapidly. A tight collaboration among the stakeholders from the army and the university is essential for successful development and maintenance of the training for the evolving role. Our findings can be leveraged by large organizations that face the challenge of developing a competent AI workforce as well as educators and researchers engaged in solving the challenge.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The rapid evolution and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way work is done in many industries, demanding a transformation in workforce structure. Beyond the scientists and engineers who innovate and advance AI capabilities, there is a growing need for AI technicians-professionals who support and maintain AI infrastructure, integrate AI solutions, and ensure seamless operation in diverse environments (see Figure 1 illustrating the structure of the AI workforce and their training/education). The emerging role of AI Technicians has yet to be precisely defined which presents a challenge in developing effective training programs.\nThe AI Technicians program is a pioneering initiative aimed at addressing this critical gap. This project is a collaborative effort between the U.S. Army's Artificial Intelligence Integration Center (AI2C) and Carnegie Mellon University, to design, implement, and evaluate novel rapid occupational training methods. The goal is to create a competitive AI workforce capable of supporting the dynamic and rapidly evolving AI-related needs of a large organization such as the U.S. Army.\nThe role of AI Technicians is to enable and accelerate the development, integration, and adoption of effective and timely AI-powered solutions within the U.S. Army. Their work involves building innovative Al applications and data streams, advancing AI workforce development, transforming platforms, establishing Al governance"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "In emerging technology domains, there is often a deliberate effort to study and systematize the skill set that professionals have, in order to define targets for training; for example in cybersecurity [12]. In other fields, such as management [2], the approach has been to explicitly teach flexibility and reflective practice, so that broadly-trained individuals can adapt themselves to the varied workplace situations they encounter. In our context, the goals were different: minimizing training time to productivity in an engineering and research facility (AI2C), and operating in a domain somewhat different than broader industry (military applications of AI). Hence, an iterative, co-evolving and co-design approach was appropriate.\nCohort learning refers to an educational approach in which a group of students progress through a program or course of study together, often following a set curriculum and timeline. This approach emphasizes the formation of a cohesive learning community, where students collaborate, support each other, and share educational experiences. Scribner and Donalson explored group dynamics and the complexity of cohort learning [21]. They suggest that cohort learning can prioritize affective learning over other kinds of learning because of the intense social relations existing in the cohort. They also point out the cognitive trap of thinking of learning and performance as synonyms. The cohort learning model offers several potential benefits for students such as the sense of community and belonging, promotion of peer learning and information sharing, exposure to diverse perspectives of peers, and a sense of progression and accountability as they move forward as a cohort with enhanced engagement, motivation, and satisfaction. For example, the increased sense of belonging has been recognized as especially important at 2-year colleges, where many students are already in the workforce trying to learn new skills and build confidence that they belong in their new roles [11]. Overall, cohort learning offers a holistic and community-oriented approach to education. This can positively impact students' success by fostering a sense of community, collaboration, and support, ultimately contributing to a more enriching and fulfilling educational experience.\nCohort-based learning is of course not new in military settings; for example Mack et al. [18] descsribe a cohort-learning based training, for a mix of STEM and non-STEM NROTC (Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps) students in a 15-week basic Python programming skills, and a group programming project to build a cybersecurity tool. While this training was successful at giving trainees a general interaction to cybersecurity, it did not train them for a particular role, such as the AI Technicians program intends to do.\nAl's rapid advancement raises concerns about job displacement and potential transformation of human job roles [1, 3]. Many educational institutions and organizations are recognizing the importance of incorporating AI into their graduate and undergraduate programs. Most such educational and training efforts on Al focus on STEM students and professionals (i.e., the top two levels of the pyramid shown in Figure 1). Hence, there is a notable emphasis on topics such as statistics, machine learning algorithms, or formal evaluation protocols. More approachable materials for learners aspiring to become technicians or operators of AI technologies (i.e., the bottom two levels of the pyramid shown in Figure 1) are much less common. Yet, there is a great need for such materials [20].\nAl literacy has been emerging as a new skill set that everyone should learn, similar to classic literacy which includes reading/writing and mathematical abilities [20]. More broadly, the emergence of the knowledge-based society requires every citizen to be digitally literate, i.e., to possess basic competencies in working with digital media, computers, and more recently AI [14]. Specifically,"}, {"title": "3 AI Technicians Program", "content": "The AI Technicians program is a multi-year cooperation between the U.S. Army's AI2C and CMU the goal of which is to develop and evaluate novel effective methods for rapid occupational training in emerging domains, Al in particular.

The most notable instruments are the following:"}, {"title": "3.1.1 Surveys.", "content": "We administered a suite of surveys, some only at the start of the term, and some repeated at the end, to capture aspects of trainees' background, plans, attitudes, and aptitudes, and when appropriate, changes in those attributes:\n\u2022 A background survey asked eleven questions about trainee characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, working hours and similar questions.\n\u2022 A frame of mind survey asked 28 questions adapted from published self-efficacy [27], belongingness [13], and STEM-identity [19] questionnaires. The survey used a five-point Likert scale. In this paper we focus on self-efficacy which is trainee's confidence in their ability to accomplish specific tasks targeted by learning objectives in the training.\n\u2022 A knowledge and skills test, administered at the start and the end of each semester, helped the instructor know the baseline knowledge trainees were starting from, as well"}, {"title": "3.1.2 Logging.", "content": "Our own Sail() platform (see Section 3.3.2) gathers learning analytics for research, including trainee navigation and presence on all content and project pages in the platform; the timing, content, and score of each assignment submission, final project scores and a breakdown by rubric item, and content and timing of required participation in an online reflection and discussion forum after each assignment."}, {"title": "3.1.3 Qualitative instrumentation.", "content": "We employ the following qualitative research instruments:\n\u2022 Peer evaluations Students working in groups on the capstone project were periodically asked to rate each other's participation.\n\u2022 Evaluations from stakeholders Milestone presentations throughout the capstone process were evaluated by CMU instructors as well as AI2C project staff.\n\u2022 Trainees focus groups performed at the end of the training allowed collection of data on trainees' perspectives on training difficulty and appropriateness. When feasible, we ran these immediately after the training, and a few months after their on-boarding in their new jobs to determine if their views had changed.\n\u2022 Supervisors focus groups after each cohort completed the training and had settled into their new jobs. The sessions were focused on investigating the fit between the training and the on-the-job needs as they played out in practice.\n\u2022 Leadership focus groups allowed us to gather information about the longer-term plans of the AI2C and its vision for the role of AI Technicians."}, {"title": "3.2 Curriculum Development", "content": "Originally (in 2020), the role of an AI Technician (at the time titled as \"AI Cloud Technician\") was loosely defined as to enable AI solutions by provisioning and maintaining the necessary infrastructure in public, private, edge or hybrid cloud as well as on premise, and to deploy and monitor AI-powered solutions. Over the subsequent years the role has been continuously re-defined to include awareness and understanding of emerging relevant problems, data manipulation and transformation, as well as supporting the development of the AI-powered solutions. The evolution of the role is reflected in the evolution of the training curriculum between 2020 and 2024 as shown in Figure 3. Notably the original one semester training (16 weeks) was eventually extended to two semesters (32 weeks). The following courses have been included in the training:\nCloud Administrator. This course teaches trainees to provision, orchestrate, scale, manage and monitor cloud services across compute, storage, networking, and security using various cloud interfaces. All projects utilize existing public cloud infrastructure, tools, and services.\nCloud DevOps. Cloud DevOps combines people, processes, and technologies in order to increase software delivery velocity and improve service reliability. Trainees design and implement strategies for application and infrastructure that enable continuous integration, testing, continuous delivery, infrastructure as code as well as monitoring.\nPractical Programming with Python. Trainees learn the concepts, techniques, skills, and tools needed for developing programs in Python. Core topics include types, variables, functions, iteration, conditionals, data structures, classes, objects, modules, and I/O operations.\nData Engineer. The topics include ingesting, egressing and transforming data from multiple sources using various technologies, services and tools. Trainees develop the skills needed to identify and meet data requirements of an organization by designing and implementing systems and data pipelines that manage, monitor and secure the data using the full stack of cloud services.\nAI Practitioner. Al Practitioner provides a thorough overview of AI and machine learning (ML) applications, with a strong emphasis on hands-on experience in developing and integrating AI/ML capabilities into software solutions, deploying and maintaining AI/ML components, and evaluating AI/ML-powered systems.\nCloud Native. The course focuses on cloud service models and providers, microservices and architecture evaluation, and effective deployment of databases in the cloud. Trainees develop the skills needed to handle inter-service communication, create ETL workflows, build CI pipelines, operate various cloud-native development tools, containerization technologies, and serverless computing frameworks."}, {"title": "3.3 Training", "content": "3.3.1 Participants. Participants are all adult learners who have been employees of the U.S. Army. For the first iteration of the training the trainees have been chosen somewhat randomly to represent the diverse workforce available across the organization. In the subsequent iterations, the AI2C has been focusing the selection criteria towards improving success of the trainees in the training program and especially in their subsequent job placement as AI Technicians at AI2C. The education levels of trainees range from a high school education, to those with completed graduate degrees.\n3.3.2 Learning Platform. The Sail() platform [6, 7] uses a project-based learning (PBL) model. Each course begins with a set of learning objectives and incorporates a scenario that uses real-world data, tasks, and infrastructure. The courses integrate (i) learning, reflection, and feedback cycles; (ii) role-based group learning activities; and (iii) rubric-driven peer code-review opportunities. Sail()"}, {"title": "3.3.3 Training Activities.", "content": "The central learning activity in the AI Technicians program is a set of project-based learning courses. The hands-on projects are designed to reflect real-world processes, constraints, tasks, and industry-standard quality measures [22]. By simulating professional practice, we expose trainees to industry norms such as unit testing, code refactoring, and troubleshooting, alongside the nominal learning objectives of each project [9]. Our project-based learning approach encourages iterative problem-solving [22]. To guide learners through these problems, we use several scaffolding techniques: primers [5, p.106] that scaffold prerequisite skills as worked examples, starter code that allows trainees to focus on just the relevant part of the project [23], and auto-grader feedback that may be requested repeatedly, to give information about trainees' partial solutions that helps them continue iterating on their work. The intent is to foster self-directed learning through actionable advice about trainees' work. In order to prompt consolidation of learning and promote social learning, after each project is completed, trainees are asked to write a reflection on their process in solving the project, and comment on each other's reflections."}, {"title": "3.3.4 Capstone Projects.", "content": "In the last year, the program was extended to a second semester, in part to include a capstone experience. The capstone projects in the AI Technicians program are designed to enculturate trainees into the AI2C environment, familiarizing them with ongoing projects, work culture, and key personnel. Over a structured, four-phase process lasting sixteen weeks, trainees collaborate with university mentors, organizational supervisors, university faculty, and teaching assistants. Each phase-covering requirements gathering and design, data engineering and model development, deployment and integration, and evaluation and redeployment-includes weekly meetings, mid-phase and comprehensive end-phase presentations. This highly iterative approach with many opportunities for feedback is designed to allow trainees not only to apply their acquired knowledge but also begin the process of integrating into the organization's operations."}, {"title": "4 Results and Discussion", "content": "In this section, we report selected results (mostly quantitative) acquired through the research instrumentation as described in Section 3.1. As this paper is meant as an initial overview of the AI Technicians program and the surrounding efforts we do not provide a detailed presentation of all the results, especially those acquired through Sail() logging and qualitative instruments. We will continue to present more fine-grained results in the subsequent publications.\nThe AI Technicians program has shown consistent improvements over the four years in terms of trainee performance, knowledge acquisition, and self-efficacy."}, {"title": "5 Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "The AI Technicians program has successfully demonstrated the viability of rapid occupational training methods tailored to the dynamic needs of the AI workforce. Through an iterative, adaptive curriculum co-designed with the stakeholders which focuses on PBL and cohort-based learning, the program has effectively prepared trainees for roles that require both practical skills and the ability to adapt to continuous technological advancements in AI. Future work should focus on scaling the AI Technicians training model to accommodate larger cohorts and different organizational contexts within the US Army. This may also include exploring hybrid and fully online delivery methods to increase accessibility and reduce costs. Longitudinal studies tracking the career progression and on-the-job performance of program graduates will provide deeper insights into the long-term impact of the training."}]}

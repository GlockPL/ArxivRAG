In\nthis paper, we construct CultureVerse, a large-scale multimodal benchmark covering 19, 682 cultural concepts, 188\ncountries/regions, 15 cultural concepts, and 3 question types, with the aim of characterizing and improving VLMs'\nmulticultural understanding capabilities. Then, we propose CultureVLM, a series of VLMs fine-tuned on our dataset\nto achieve significant performance improvement in cultural understanding. Our evaluation of 16 models reveals\nsignificant disparities, with a stronger performance in Western concepts and weaker results in African and Asian\ncontexts. Fine-tuning on our CultureVerse enhances cultural perception, demonstrating cross-cultural, cross-continent,\nand cross-dataset generalization without sacrificing performance on models' general VLM benchmarks.

Meanwhile, one of the most vital aspects of human experience, cultural understanding, which encompasses\nlanguage, cultural values, social norms, culinary practices, and artistic expressions-remains a challenging area for these\nmodels (Adilazuarda et al., 2024; Winata et al., 2024).\nChallenges. Cultural understanding is essential for AI systems intended for global deployment, as it enables them to\ninteract appropriately and sensitively with users of diverse cultural, ethnic, and social backgrounds. However, current\nVLMs often struggle to grasp the deeper cultural meanings embedded in symbols and artifacts. For instance, a VLM\nmay identify an eagle as merely a bird, overlooking its symbolic significance as a national emblem representing the\nspirit and identity of the United States. Similarly, the lotus flower is not only a plant, but a profound symbol of purity\nand spiritual enlightenment in Indian culture. Gestures present an even more complex challenge: the \u201cOK\u201d hand gesture,\nwhich conveys a positive meaning in North American countries, is interpreted as offensive in countries such as Brazil\nand Turkey (Medhat, 2015). Misinterpretations of culturally significant symbols can lead to misunderstandings and\neven cause offense.\nThese challenges partially stem from inherent biases and limitations in VLMs' training data: 1) Skewed Domain\nCoverage. Pre-training images and texts predominantly feature generic daily scenes or natural settings, often lacking\ncoverage of culturally specific artifacts, traditions, beliefs, and historical sites. Models may fail to interpret culturally\nsignificant symbols, particularly those from underrepresented regions. 2) English-centric Data and Western Bias. The\ntexts for pre-training VLMs is primarily sourced from English content (Jin et al., 2024a; Naous et al., 2023a), which"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Cultural Bias in LLMs and VLMs. Recent research has increasingly focused on cultural biases present in large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Johnson et al. (2022) investigated conflicts between model outputs and input values and\nfound that GPT-3's responses often aligned more closely with dominant U.S. cultural norms. Similarly, Naous et al.\n(2023b) observed a bias toward Western cultural perspectives in models processing Arabic text. The Cultural Alignment\nTest (CAT), based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework (Geert Hofstede, 2010), was used to evaluate the\ncultural alignment of models like ChatGPT and Bard across various regions, showing that GPT-4 exhibited the strongest\nalignment with U.S. values (Masoud et al., 2023). Additionally, Cao et al. (2023) found that, while ChatGPT was well-\naligned with American cultural values, it struggled to represent other cultures accurately, especially when responding to\nEnglish prompts. Liu et al. (2023a) further reported that multilingual LLMs showed limited proficiency in reasoning\nwith proverbs and revealed a \"culture gap\" in translation tasks (Liu et al., 2023b).\nDatasets and Models for Cultural Understanding. Most of the research used existing datasets as cultural datasets.\nWang et al. (2023) introduced a benchmark based on the World Values Survey (WVS) (Survey, 2022) and the Political\nCulture and Trust (PCT) dataset (Mudde, 2016). Subsequent works include the Cultural Alignment Test (Masoud et al.,\n2023), NORMSAGE (Fung et al., 2022), WorldValueBench (Zhao et al., 2024), and NORMAD (Rao et al., 2024), each\ndrawing on various existing datasets. Other sources include CultureAtlas (Fung et al., 2024) and MAPS (Liu et al.,\n2023a), which collected data from Wikimedia, while Candle (Nguyen et al., 2023a) and CultureBank (Shi et al., 2024)\ngathered data from social media platforms, including TikTok and Reddit. In contrast, there is a growing trend toward\nautomatic data augmentation such as (Li et al., 2024b,c). A strand of research focuses on training cultural-specific LLMs\nby assembling large-scale pre-training datasets, followed by fine-tuning to enhance alignment (Abbasi et al., 2023;\nChan et al., 2023; Lin and Chen, 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023b; Pipatanakul et al., 2023; Pires et al., 2023). Instead of\nrelying on massive data collection, Li et al. (2024b,c) proposed cost-efficient approaches to fine-tuning cultural-specific\nmodels by data augmentation.\nUnlike LLMs, training data are significantly more difficult to obtain for VLMs. The research in VLMs' cultural\nbias is still preliminary, with most efforts in manual data collection (Bhatia et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021; Nayak et al.,\n2024; Romero et al., 2024). MaRVL (Liu et al., 2021) introduced a protocol for building an ImageNet-style hierarchy\nthat represents a wider range of languages and cultures. CVQA (Romero et al., 2024) proposed a culturally diverse\nmultilingual visual question-answering benchmark designed to encompass a wide variety of languages and cultural\ncontexts, engaging native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. CulturalVQA (Nayak et al., 2024)\ndeveloped a visual question-answering benchmark focused on evaluating VLMs' understanding of culturally diverse,\ngeographically specific content. GlobalRG (Bhatia et al., 2024) presents two challenging tasks: retrieval across cultural\nuniversals and culturally specific visual grounding.\nHowever, these datasets are often limited in size, lack sufficient regional and national representation, and may\nexhibit weak cultural relevance. More critically, at the model level, there has been no significant effort to develop\nculturally aware VLMs, posing a major barrier to AI equity for underrepresented cultures. Table 1 shows the key\ndifference between our benchmark and existing multimodal cultural benchmarks, clearly showing that our benchmark\ncontains more diverse and large-scale data."}, {"title": "Culture Verse: A Scalable Benchmark for VLM Cultural Understanding", "content": "Collecting reliable large-scale culture datasets presents two key challenges: Diversity and Scalability. Achieving\ncomprehensive coverage is especially difficult for culturally diverse topics, particularly underrepresented groups in the\nGlobal South. The construction and annotation of such datasets would typically require substantial human expertise\nfrom various countries and ethnic groups, resulting in poor scalability and high costs. Existing cultural benchmarks for\nVLMs usually lack adequate representation of diverse regions and communities, and often reflecting a bias towards\ndominant cultures (Liu et al., 2021; Oh et al., 2024; Romero et al., 2024).\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce a scalable data collection pipeline that integrates automated web\ncrawling for scalability and diversity with expert human annotation for reliability. As shown in Figure 1, our pipeline\nconsists of three stages: tangible cultural concept collection, question-answer generation, and quality assurance. This\nhybrid approach ensures that our dataset captures a wide spectrum of cultural contexts while maintaining high standards\nof data quality and relevance."}, {"title": "Tangible Cultural Concept Collection", "content": "To construct a comprehensive set of cultural concepts, a common approach is to employ a bottom-up strategy that\nretrieves specialized knowledge from open web documents. For example, Fung et al. (2024) begin with an initial set\nof cultural topics (e.g., education, marriage customs, and holiday traditions), collect relevant Wikipedia documents,\nand expand their scope through linked connections. However, many resulting documents primarily describe general,\nabstract, or high-level concepts, such as Renaissance Art or Mediterranean cuisine, which often lack\nspecific, unambiguous visual representations.\nConcept Construction. To overcome this issue, we adopt a top-down approach, starting with 15 predefined categories\nof tangible cultural concepts such as food, festivals, landmarks, and performing arts, as shown in Table 2. These\ncategories were chosen to capture culturally distinctive and visually recognizable elements suitable for image retrieval\nand analysis. We then use GPT-40 to process all relevant Wikipedia documents, extracting conceptual entities that\nalign with the 15 predefined categories. To ensure the quality and specificity of the extracted entities, we implement\na 3-step filtering process on the extracted conceptual entities: 1) Entity Consolidation. We unified duplicate entities,\nmerging those that are identical or differ solely by case, and eliminated entities with formatting issues or irregularities;\n2) Frequency-based Thresholding. We retained only entities that appeared at least twice across the documents from\na given country, ensuring that the concepts are well-recognized within their cultural context; 3) Entity Refinement.\nWe filtered out overly abstract or generic entities such as Imperial Cuisine and those lacking distinct regional\nspecificity such as Steak using additional judgment by GPT-40. Through this refined process, we curated a collection\nof over 19, 682 cultural concepts from 188 countries, as shown in Table 10. Our pipeline ensures that the selected\nconcepts are diverse and well-recognized, relevant for evaluating the capabilities of VLMs in understanding global\ncultural diversity.\nImage Retrieval. Using these concepts and their corresponding countries, we scrape images from Google Images for\neach cultural concept\u00b9, obtaining five images for each concept. The first image was reserved for the test set and for\nhuman quality assessment, while the remaining four images were used for the training set. Images larger than 10MB\nwere compressed to ensure compatibility with typical input requirements of VLMs."}, {"title": "Question-Answer Generation", "content": "We designed three levels of VQA tasks to assess and improve the multicultural knowledge of VLMs:\nImage Recognition Questions evaluate models' ability to identify cultural concepts in images. Accurate identification\nof such concepts is fundamental to retrieving relevant cultural knowledge. Given an image and a cultural concept,\nmodels answer questions like \"What dish is in the image?\"\nCultural Knowledge Questions further evaluate model's deeper understanding of the cultural background associated\nwith the concepts. For each concept, we generated comprehensive descriptions, including aspects like location,\ncharacteristics, history, and cultural significance. Subsequently, we instruct GPT-40 to formulate a question based on the\nintroduction and the image to probe this cultural knowledge without directly naming the concept in the question. These\nquestions require the model to identify cultural concepts and apply various levels of reasoning, drawing on relevant\ncultural knowledge to provide accurate answers."}, {"title": "Quality Assurance", "content": "To ensure the integrity of the dataset, we conduct a comprehensive manual quality check on each cultural concept,\nalong with its corresponding images and questions. Specifically, we employ human annotators (details are shown in\nAppendix C) to inspect three main components:\n\u2022 Image-Concept Alignment. We assessed whether each cultural concept accurately represents the culture of its\nrespective country or region and is either unique to or widely recognized within that. We started with frequency\nanalysis and leverage GPT-40 for preliminary screening, effectively filtering out less desirable data and significantly\nreducing the manual review workload.\n\u2022 Image Quality Check. We checked the image quality and ensured that the cultural concept is accurately presented\nin the image.\n\u2022 Question & Answer Validation. We verified that all three generated questions are reasonable, clear, logically sound,\nand have a single correct answer. Annotators refined the questions and answer options by removing redundant\ninformation and resolving any ambiguities to maintain clarity and accuracy.\nFollowing the quality assurance process, we utilized human annotations for the evaluation set of Culture Verse\nwhile applying the automated annotation pipeline to the larger training set. With over 98% of the evaluation set\nsamples correctly annotated by the automated process, we conclude that the pipeline is highly effective. Any remaining\nerroneous or challenging samples that could not be refined were filtered out to maintain the dataset's high quality.\nAdditional details on annotator accuracy are in Appendix C.2."}, {"title": "Scalability", "content": "Our approach to constructing multimodal cultural datasets is notably more scalable and comprehensive than existing\nmethods. Existing ones mostly rely on manual efforts to search for cultural concepts, retrieve images, and formulate"}, {"title": "Analysis of Culture Verse", "content": "Figure 2(a) illustrates the distribution of three tasks (Section 3.2), 5 continents (188 countries, with North and South\nAmerica combined into America) and 15 cultural topics in CultureVerse. Since cultural concepts are collected at the\ncountry level, regions with more countries, such as Asia and Europe, naturally yield larger datasets. Detailed counts of\ncountries and concepts are provided in the Appendix 10. Detailed statistics of the concepts are provided in Table 1.\nCompared to recent multi-model culture benchmarks, CultureVerse is driven by tangible, presentable cultural concepts,\nachieving an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of countries, images, and questions. This expansion advances\nmultimodal and multi-cultural research beyond a limited set of countries, moving toward truly global, inclusive cultural\ninteraction and integration. Figure 2(b) shows examples of the three questions associated with one concept, and it is\nobvious that different types of questions aim to evaluate different abilities."}, {"title": "Experiments with Culture Verse", "content": "5.1 Experimental Setup\nData Split. To ensure a robust evaluation, we partition CultureVerse into training and test sets for all countries/regions,\nallowing us to assess transferability between regions. We select more common cultural concepts from the entire dataset\nfor the test set, which underwent manual quality checks, while the training set includes all cultural concepts. We\nensured that the images in the training and test sets did not overlap to prevent data leakage. More details can be found\nin Appendix B.1.\nModels and Hyperparameters. We evaluate our benchmark on 14 open-source and 2 proprietary VLMs. For multiple-\nchoice questions, we employ greedy search decoding for deterministic predictions. We use vllm (Kwon et al., 2023)\nand Imdeploy (Contributors, 2023) toolkits to speed up inference. We report accuracy, in line with previous works (Liu\net al., 2024b). More details of the experiment can be seen in Appendix B.1."}, {"title": "Main Results", "content": "The main results are in Figure 3 and detailed results are in Appendix B.2. Our main findings are as follows.\nTask Difficulty: Cultural Scene Reasoning Outperforms Recognition. From the task perspective, we observe that\nimage recognition and cultural knowledge questions pose challenges comparable to VLMs. Image recognition tests\nVLMs' ability to identify culturally specific objects or concepts, which relies heavily on diverse and relevant image\ndata. For instance, recognizing traditional foods like kimchi from Korea, or regional attire such as a sari from India,\nrequires the model to have encountered similar image-text pairs in its training data. In contrast, cultural knowledge\nquestions assess the model's understanding of broader cultural elements based on text-based training. For example,\nasking about the significance of a festival like Diwali or the symbolism of a red envelope during Lunar New Year taps\ninto the model's text-based memory, which tends to be richer due to the abundance of internet text data. Interestingly,\nthe scene reasoning task, which integrates images with contextual background (e.g., a Japanese tea ceremony scene or a\nBrazilian Carnival parade), tends to yield higher accuracy. This indicates that providing contextual information in texts\nand images allows the VLMs to better connect visual cues with their underlying cultural meanings, leading to improved\nperformance.\nRegional Disparities: Better Performance in Western Cultures. A dominant regional disparity is observed among\nall models: VLMs demonstrate the strongest cultural understanding of the Americas, followed by Europe and Oceania.\nThis trend reflects the dominance of English data centered around the Global North, leading to a disproportionate focus\non Western cultural content. North America's relatively homogenous cultural landscape, combined with fewer countries,\ncontributes to better model performance. In contrast, Asia and Africa show significantly weaker results, likely due\nto the scarcity of digitized, English-language data and the high cultural diversity in these regions. For instance, Asia\nconsists of many countries with distinct and complex cultural contexts, such as those from East Asia, South Asia, and\nSoutheast Asia, both within and across nations. Although Asia has the most data in CultureVerse (see Figure 2), the\nmodels struggle to capture the intra-regional and inter-regional cultural nuances, resulting in suboptimal performance.\nWeak Understanding of History and Landmarks. VLMs generally exhibit weaker recognition and understanding of\ncultural concepts related to history and landmarks. The primary reason is the relatively limited internet data available\non historical figures and landmarks. Additionally, recognizing a landmark typically requires training data that includes\nimages from multiple perspectives to form a comprehensive, three-dimensional understanding."}, {"title": "Training CultureVLM", "content": "We fine-tuned three models: LLaVA-1.5, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaMa-3.2-Vision, with the results presented in Figure 4b.\nCultural knowledge, in contrast to reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, is relatively easier to enhance as a\nform of memory-based perception. Consequently, all four models achieved consistent and substantial improvements,\nreaching performance levels comparable to those of closed-source models. We also performed ablation studies to\nanalyze the impact of fine-tuning data size and option shuffling.\nImpact of Data Sizes. We vary the number of fine-tuning examples within [5%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 100%] to examine\nthe effects of training data sizes on the final results. As shown in Figure 4c and 4d, the model's performance decreases\nas the training data is reduced. However, the decline is minimal, indicating that even a small amount of training data\ncan effectively enhance the model's multicultural awareness.\nImpact of Decoding Temperatures. We evaluate the performance of the original models and CultureVLMs under\ndifferent temperature and decoding settings, as shown in Appendix B.3. It can be observed that VLMs perform better\nwhen the temperature is lower and decoding diversity is reduced. However, when the temperature reaches 1.0, there is a\nnoticeable and expected decline in performance."}, {"title": "Generalization and Robustness", "content": "To evaluate the generalizability of VLMs in multicultural contexts, we partitioned the training data by continents\n(Americas, Asia, Europe, Africa, Oceania) and fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5-7B (Liu et al., 2024b) separately on each subset.\nTable 5 in the appendix illustrates the performance of each model trained on specific continental data and tested in all\nregions, and Figure 5 shows the aggregated results.\nIntra- and Inter-continent Generalization. The diagonal values represent cases where the model was trained and\nevaluated on data from the same continent, consistently yielding the highest scores. Notably, Asia achieved the best\nperformance (90.8), followed closely by Europe and the Americas (90.5), indicating strong regional specialization.\nFurthermore, the off-diagonal values reveal models' ability to generalize across regions. Although cross-region scores\nare generally lower, the model still exhibits reasonable transferability. Fine-tuning on Oceania, however, resulted in the\nlowest average performance drop, from 85.2 to 75.0, suggesting a distinct data distribution for this region.\nRobustness across Concepts. We grouped the 15 concepts into 3 main classes: Cultural Heritage and Traditions\n(CHT), History and Landmarks (HL), and Natural Environment and Local Resources (NELR) using GPT-40. We then\nconducted training in each group and evaluated on all groups. The specific category mappings are in Appendix A. As\nshown in Figure 5 (right), models generally perform the best when trained and evaluated within the same category\n(in-distribution). The model fine-tuned on HL exhibits greater generalization, achieving an average performance of 87.8,\ncompared to NELR (84.3). High off-diagonal scores, such as CultureVLM-HL's 87.2 when tested on CHT, indicate\nsubstantial cross-category knowledge transfer, particularly between culturally related classes.\nCross-dataset Generalization. We also evaluated the generalization ability of CultureVLM for cultural reasoning\non other datasets. As shown in Figure 6, we tested LLaVA-1.5-7B on CVQA (Romero et al., 2024) before and\nafter fine-tuning. It is evident that our CultureVLM achieves improvements across most countries and cultures (7%\nimprovement on average), which can be attributed to the comprehensive coverage of our dataset global nations and\ncultures, indicating potential of CultureVerse for cultural research."}, {"title": "Catastrophic Forgetting", "content": "Catastrophic forgetting (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) refers to the phenomenon where a model loses previously learned\nknowledge when trained on new information, especially when the new data diverges significantly from the pretraining\ndata. This can be especially problematic in cultural knowledge acquisition, as it may cause the model to compromise\nessential commonsense knowledge in favor of culture-specific details.\nTo assess this, we evaluate the models on standard VQA benchmarks, including ScienceQA (Saikh et al., 2022) and\nTextVQA (Singh et al., 2019) to determine if the process of acquiring cultural knowledge inadvertently diminishes\ntheir grasp of general commonsense concepts. The results in Figure 8 reveal that our fine-tuned CultureVLM merely\ninfluences general VLM tasks, indicating the versatility of the solution."}, {"title": "Case Study", "content": "Figure 7 shows the responses of LLaVA and CultureVLM. We incorporate extensive explanations into the training data,\nenriching CultureVLM with substantial knowledge that enhances its cultural recognition and understanding ability.\nMore analysis and case studies are in Appendix D."}, {"title": "Conclusion and Limitation", "content": "We constructed CultureVerse, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark to characterize the multicultural understanding\nof VLMs. Extensive evaluation shows significant performance disparities across regions and tasks, highlighting VLMs'\nstrong biases towards Western cultural contexts and their weaker performance in underrepresented regions like Africa\nand Asia. Using supervised fine-tuning in CultureVerse, we demonstrated effective enhancements in cultural perception\nand cross-cultural generalization. Our findings underscore the importance of culturally diverse training data and provide\nactionable insights to improve VLMs.\nWe also acknowledge the following limitations. First, while we use languages as proxies for cultural boundaries in the\ndevelopment of CultureVLM, we acknowledge that language alone does not capture the full complexity of culture. This\nsimplification was made to address challenges in defining cultural contexts, inspired by previous research (Appadurai,\n1996; Li et al., 2024b; Myung et al., 2024). Our pipeline and approach remain flexible to incorporate additional\nlanguages and cultures. Second, due to resource constraint cost, we limit our fine-tuning experiments to the current\nset of models. Evaluating a wider range of models could yield further insight. Third, the current CultureVerse only\ncontains multiple-choice questions. Exploring open-ended questions could offer additional avenues for assessment. Our\ndata and models will be released to the public after ethical reviews."}, {"title": "Experimental Setup", "content": "Evaluation Models.

Most of them are within the\nnon-AI areas such as education, specific languages, and history. When assigning the annotation job, we asked each\nannotator to label the correctness, consistency, and relatedness of our questions and answers. Specifically, correctness\nrefers to the correctness of the generated questions and answers, consistency refers to the consistency between the\nquestions, answers, and the concepts, and relatedness aims to make sure that the concepts and generated questions\nare related to each other. We asked the annotators not only to make judgement based on their experience but also to\nmanually check the results via Google search and other search engines.

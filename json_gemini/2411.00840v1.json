Linking intraoperative data with postoperative outcomes is a promising and low-cost way of evaluating long-term impacts of surgical interventions. In this study, we evaluated how preoperative cognitive status as measured by the clock drawing test contributed to predicting length of hospital stay, hospital charges, average pain experienced during follow-up, and 1-year mortality over and above intraoperative variables, demographics, preoperative physical status and comorbidities. We expanded our analysis to 6 specific surgical groups where sufficient data was available for cross-validation. The clock drawing images were represented by 10 constructional features discovered by a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm, previously validated to differentiate between dementia and non-dementia patients. Different machine learning models were trained using 5-fold cross-validation to classify postoperative outcomes in hold-out test sets. The models were compared with respect to their relative performance, time complexity, and interpretability. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis was used to find the most predictive features for classifying different outcomes in different surgical contexts. Relative classification performances achieved by different feature sets showed that the perioperative cognitive dataset which included clock drawing features in addition to intraoperative variables, demographics, and comorbidities served as the best dataset for 12 of 18 possible surgery-outcome combinations. Interpretability analysis showed that duration of surgery was the most significant predictor of adverse outcomes, followed by the mean alveolar concentration of isoflurane or sevoflurane used during anesthesia. Disruptions in baseline correlations between intraoperative variables in different surgeries and the relative directionality of these variables in SHAP plots revealed that low average blood pressure and high standard deviation of blood pressure (ie, risk of blood loss during surgery) predicted adverse outcomes. Among the clock features, differences in clock size was the most significant predictor of adverse outcomes.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "The risk of postoperative complications in older adults depends on preoperative health modulated by the type of surgery and quality of anesthesia.1 Subjective measures of comorbidity such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score are the most commonly used metrics for assessing preoperative health risk.2 However, such assessments may not be sufficient for predicting postoperative outcomes.3,4 Recently, machine learning (ML) models and other heuristic scores have been used to stratify the risk of mortality and other specific outcomes using a combination of preoperative and intraoperative indices.5\u201313 However, studies that explored the relationships between pre-anesthesia physical status and intraoperative variables were generally undertaken for a specific surgery, except for a few studies8,13 where the risk of multiple adverse outcomes was stratified over a wide variety of surgery types. No study has yet investigated the impact of preoperative screeners beyond comorbidities for the prediction of postoperative outcomes.\nPostoperative outcome prediction models built on intraoperative variables may be improved by examining the additional contribution of preoperative cognitive screeners beyond comorbidities. Preoperative cognitive screeners have been shown to predict the risk of postoperative delirium and mortality in older adults.14 Memory and executive subitems from cognitive screeners such as the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)15 have been shown to predict postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery 16 and screeners from the Mini-Cog17 could predict outcomes after orthopedic surgery. 18 However, these studies did not examine the importance of preoperative cognitive screener performance in addition to that of intraoperative variables such as anesthesia type, anesthesia depth, and duration of surgery for predicting postoperative adverse outcomes. Without this exploration, the value of cognitive screeners cannot be fully assessed. This topic has become increasingly relevant due to the increasing number of older adults nationally, 19 combined with the facts that older adult patients represent at least 50% of all surgeries20 and the expected rate of dementia is increasing on average 6% across the United States.21\nFor this investigation, we explored the additive effect of preoperative cognitive screening performance as measured by the command and copy clock drawing test (CDT) over and above intraoperative variables, preoperative physical status, demographics, and comorbidities on postoperative outcomes for older adults electing surgeries within a tertiary care medical center. The CDT is a simple yet intuitive measure of cognitive function. The test is comprised of 2 parts: (A) the command condition, where the subject is asked to \u201cdraw a clock, put in all the numbers, and set the hands to 10 after 11,\u201d followed by (B) the copy condition, where the subject is asked to copy a model clock. Accurate clock construction relies on a seamless and integrated operation of several cognitive abilities, and subtle changes in clock drawing can reveal underlying cognitive deficits.22 For example, clock drawing to command condition requires the simultaneous syntactic comprehension of verbal instructions, recalling the semantic attributes of a clock, working memory, accurate mental planning, and fine motor skills.23 Similarly, in the copy condition, clock construction is reliant on visual scanning abilities, visuoconstruction, and executive functioning.24 We represented clock drawings using a semi-supervised deep learning (DL)\u2013based 10-dimensional representation that was previously validated to capture unique constructional features of the CDT relevant to dementia.25 We hypothesized that irrespective of the surgical context, preoperative cognition as encoded by this DL representation of clock drawings would inform classification of postoperative outcomes that are explicitly unrelated to cognition. Figure 1 highlights the process flow in the perioperative surgical environment network and shows how in this study we integrated different data modalities arising during different stages of this process into an analytic framework for predicting postoperative adverse outcomes."}, {"title": "METHODS", "content": "Data were collected via a federally funded investigation at the University of Florida (UF) and UF Health Shands hospital.

The study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines set by the Declaration of Helsinki, respective university guidelines, and TRIPOD criteria.26\nThe original surgical dataset was comprised of 22,473 patients aged 65 or older who completed an in-person preoperative assessment for elective surgeries between January 2018 and December 2019. Of this data, we possessed complete intraoperative data for 18,037 patients, preoperative physical status information for 12,422 patients, complete demographics (age, race, sex, ethnicity, education, and area deprivation index [ADI]27-29) for 10,055 patients, and clock drawings for 11,777 patients.

Every participant completed a preoperative clock drawing to command and copy condition as part of a hospital wide preoperative screening program for older adults. 32 Per published instructions, individuals were required to \"draw the face of a clock, put in the numbers, and set the hands to ten after eleven,\" and then copy a model clock.33 Clock drawings were captured using digital pen technology.34,35 Only the final output image of the digital clock drawing was used for this analysis. Final output images of clock drawings to command and copy conditions were projected on a 10D DL latent space described in our previous work. 25,36 The deep CDT representation used in this study originated from a latent representation developed using semi-supervised training of a relevance-factor variational autoencoder (RF-VAE) network to classify dementia from non-dementia participants. 25 Briefly, a RF-VAE network was trained using 23,521 unlabeled clock drawings collected as part of a routine check-up in the preoperative setting.32 The RF-VAE discovered 10 unique constructional aspects of the CDT that were validated to be different in people with dementia versus healthy peers using a smaller classification dataset. This study excluded participants if they were non-fluent in English, had <4 years of education or had some visual, motor or hearing impairment that severely limited their ability to execute a CDT. A prior publication reported a simpler version of this representation, which studied the same constructional features of clock drawings in the form of a 2-dimensional representation, and assessed its ability to classify between dementia and non-dementia participants belonging to the same classification dataset.36 These datasets have been described in previous studies.22,34,37\u201339 Participants whose clock drawings were used to train the RF-VAE network overlapped with those in our current study. The 10 unique constructional features described in the above study are shown in Supplemental Figure 2A-B. The relative occurrence in dementia samples described above is shown in Supplemental Figure 2C. All numerical variables were scaled to their respective maximum values to create a normalized dataset and all categorical variables were one-hot encoded.

Among these, clock size was the most important cognitive predictor in 5 surgery-outcome contexts: 2 orthopedic (LOS, charges), 1 neurosurgery (charges), 1 cardiovascular (charges), 1 gynecology (LOS) (Figures 4A, 4B, 4E, 4H, 4M). In orthopedic surgery, larger clock size predicted greater LOS and greater hospital charges (Figures 4A, 4B). In contrast, in neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery, and gynecologic surgery a larger clock predicted lower charges and lower LOS, respectively (Figures 4E, 4H, 4M). Clock size was also an important predictor in 2 of the remaining 4 surgery-outcome combinations (urology-charges, and otolaryngology-LOS) (Figures 4K, 4P). Therefore, clock size was found to be the most prevalent predictive cognitive characteristic in this report. Other frequently important clock features were rotated ellipse (normal or vertical), upward displaced hands, ovate-obovate shape, and obtuse angle between hands. Rotated ellipse and/or rotated vertical ellipse predicted longer LOS in orthopedic surgery (Figure 4A), lower hospital charges in neurosurgery (Figure 4E), lower hospital charges in cardiovascular surgery (Figure 4H), higher pain in urologic surgery (Figure 4L), and lower LOS in gynecologic surgery (Figure 4M). It was also an important predictor in otolaryngology-LOS, but the directionality could not be easily understood (Figure 4P). Therefore, rotated elliptical preoperative clocks were the second most prevalent cognitive predictor in our study.\nUpward displaced clock hands predicted lower charges in orthopedic surgery (Figure 4B), lower LOS, higher charges, and higher pain in urologic surgery (Figures 4J, K), and higher LOS in otolaryngology surgery (Figure 4P). Obovate clocks predicted higher charges in orthopedic surgery (Figure 4B), higher LOS and lower pain in urologic surgery (Figures 4J, 4L), and lower LOS in gynecology surgery (Figure 4M). An obtuse angle between hands predicted lower charges in orthopedic surgery (Figure 4B), cardiovascular surgery (Figure 4H), and higher LOS in urologic surgery (Figure 4J).\nTherefore, after clock size, 2 clock shape features (elliptical and obovate) and 2 hand placement features (upward displacement and wide angle between) were the most significant features."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "This study shows that a complex array of perioperative network cognitive, anesthetic, and physical variables predicted postoperative adverse outcomes such as longer length of stay, higher hospital charges, higher average pain, and mortality.

Phenylephrine HCl and ephedrine sulphate, both vasopressors, were negatively correlated to each other. The first group of strong positive correlations represents the anesthetic and analgesic network, while the second group of positive correlations represents the hemodynamic management network. These represent the 2 primary housekeeping tasks during any surgical procedure. A graphical illustration of these associations is shown in Figure 5.\nAdditionally, certain surgical contexts, such as orthopedic, urologic, gynecologic, and otolaryngologic surgeries exhibited a strong negative association between propofol and iso-sev-MAC. Our findings indicated that in different surgery-outcome combinations these general correlation patterns were disrupted in patients suffering from long-term adverse outcomes. This breakdown of correlation patterns was found in the relative \"directionality of influence\u201d of these features while being utilized by the ML models to predict adverse outcomes. The hemodynamic network demonstrated higher disruption in adverse outcomes than the anesthetic and analgesic network. The hemodynamic network showed a deviation from expected correlation 9 of 12 times while the anesthetic network did so 2 of 12 times when their features were significant predictors of adverse outcomes. This observation combined with the fact that the most common disruption in the hemodynamic network was higher variance in blood pressure with low AVG NIBP indicates that blood loss during surgery was a driver of postoperative adverse outcomes. Despite not being disrupted as much as the hemodynamic network, the anesthetic and analgesic network was the more important of the two in predicting adverse outcomes because duration of surgery was the most significant predictor in our study. Furthermore, iso-sev-MAC was within the top 2 most important predictors in 7 of 18 scenarios, while oral MME was within the top 10 predictors in 7 of 18 scenarios, suggesting that a combination of longer surgery and greater depth of anesthesia and analgesia concertedly generated adverse postoperative effects."}, {"title": "Significance of Clock Drawing Features", "content": "Preoperative cognition was represented by the CDT. Specifically, the CDT to command and copy condition was projected onto a pretrained RF-VAE, DL encoder which represented the clock drawing as a combination of 10 unique, mutually disentangled constructional features of the clockface.25 These features had been previously validated to distinguish between clocks drawn by dementia and non-dementia patients. Among the clock drawing features that were investigated, clock size was the most important predictor. This was followed by distorted clock shape represented by rotated ellipticity and obovateness, as well as abnormal time representation as seen by the upward displacement and obtuse angle between the clock hands. Successful clock drawing requires the coordination of multiple neurocognitive operations including access to semantic information, mental planning, visuospatial reasoning, and motor ability.24 In a community-dwelling, non-dementia sample, clock drawing has been linked to the integrity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter connexions50 and a large array of neuropsychological test parameters, 51 further illustrating that multiple neurocognitive operations must be coordinated for successful test performance. Aberrations in clock size and shape are frequently present in patients with greater dysexecutive impairment.33,52,53 Problems in the correct representation of time (ie, incorrectly drawing the clock hands) has been shown to the associated with a combination of semantic and dysexecutive deficits. 24 Thus, the digital clock drawing test is parsimonious, provides data not otherwise available using other tests, and is a well-tolerated means by which to assess perisurgical cognitive abilities."}, {"title": "Relative Importance of Different Variable Groups", "content": "Although the perioperative cognitive variables demonstrated strongest classification performance in 12 of 18 surgery-outcome combinations, the difference in performance from the other variable sets, especially the intraoperative variables, were not considerable (Supplemental Figure 3).

Application of ML models allowed the modeling of nested, nonlinear relationships within the multimodal datasets. Interpretability analysis using SHAP helped us understand the characteristics of adverse outcomes from the lenses of intraoperative, preoperative physical status, and cognitive variables.

The size of the initial dataset was significantly impacted by missing entries. The final dataset used for classification was one-fourth of the size of the initial dataset.

In the future, individual surgeries should be studied with appropriate postoperative outcomes, and DL-based clustering or self-supervised learning can be used to learn compressed representations of the surgeries themselves. These ideas combined with multitask learning can generate a deep surgical signature helpful for downstream classification of postoperative complications. The use of transfer learning or multitask learning can create information that can be translated to other datasets/tasks. We will also explore the hypothesis of the positive correlation between cognitive well-being and postoperative recovery in future works."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "In summary, this work represents the first of its kind to perform an integrated Al-driven modeling of a diverse group of surgeries for classifying multiple postoperative outcomes. We show that the perioperative network of variables including preoperative cognitive factors can provide additional information for predicting postoperative outcomes over and beyond intraoperative variables. However, it also emphasizes the importance of intraoperative anesthetic, analgesic, and hemodynamic factors in this regard. This report illustrates that hemodynamic mismanagement and increased surgery duration, anesthesia depth, and analgesia dosage all contributed significantly to development of postoperative adverse effects. It also indicated that preoperative cognitive ability might have a protective effect on postsurgical health."}]}

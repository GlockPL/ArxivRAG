This study addresses this gap by investigating how BLV users experience mobile games with varying accessibility levels. Through interviews with 32 experienced BLV mobile players, we explore their perceptions, challenges, and strategies for engaging with mobile games. Our findings reveal that BLV players turn to mobile games to alleviate boredom, achieve a sense of accomplishment, and build social connections, but face barriers depending on the game's accessibility level. We also compare mobile games to other forms of gaming, highlighting the relative advantages of mobile games, such as the inherent accessibility of smartphones. This study contributes to understanding BLV mobile gaming experiences and provides insights for enhancing accessible mobile game design.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The gaming industry is experiencing rapid growth worldwide, with mobile gaming leading the way. In 2023, mobile games dominated the gaming market, generating 49% of the total $90.4 billion in revenue, followed by computer games at 29% [66]. Considering the limited digital resources and the digital divide, the advantages of mobile games are even more pronounced in the Global South. The number of players in sub-Saharan Africa nearly tripled, from 77 million in 2015 to 186 million in 2021 [95]. This growth is primarily due to the rapid spread of mobile gaming, with 95% of players in sub-Saharan Africa playing on smartphones or tablets, rather than on consoles or personal computers [95]. However, despite the proliferation of mobile games, the experience of BLV players remains largely underexplored.\nAs BLV players increasingly engage with video games [24, 68], there has been a rise in the development of non-visual games (e.g., audio games) [7, 12, 85], alongside the integration of accessibility features in many mainstream games.\nSome HCI research has also explored the design of accessible gaming tools, focusing on balancing accessibility for BLV players with the complex experience of gaming [35, 67, 68, 84, 89]. However, a significant portion of mainstream games still lack sufficient accessibility features.\nPrevious studies have shown that BLV individuals are enthusiastic about games with varying levels of accessibility [38], although much of the prior research has focused primarily on their experiences with accessible games aimed at BLV players [19, 85].\nMobile games, due to their widespread use and portability, have become an increasingly popular choice among BLV players [44, 61]. However, despite the dominance of mobile games as a mainstream form of entertainment [93], the experiences of BLV players are often overlooked. Some studies have explored game accessibility for BLV players in areas such as computer and tabletop games, but few HCI scholars have examined the mobile gaming experience and its accessibility for BLV users. There is a notable gap in research regarding how mobile game features-such as popularity and portability-are integrated into mobile gaming experiences for BLV players and how they navigate games with different levels of accessibility on mobile platforms. This represents a significant gap in the literature, particularly concerning how BLV players experience mobile games in real-world settings. Given the rising prevalence of mobile games and their unique position within the gaming ecosystem, understanding how BLV players interact with these games is essential for advancing accessible game design.\nTo explore these problem spaces, especially considering the Global South context with limited accessibility, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 32 experienced BLV mobile game players in China, each having played mobile games for over 200 hours and engaging in gameplay for at least three hours per week. We focus on the following research questions throughout the studies:\nRQ1: What are the perceptions of BLV players regarding playing mobile games?\nRQ2: What challenges do BLV players face while playing games and how do they experience gaming on mobile platforms?\nRQ3: How do different levels of accessibility in mobile games impact the gaming experience of BLV players?\nOur research shows that mobile games, with their high accessibility, strong portability, spacetime flexibility, and high popularity, can help BLV players alleviate anxiety, access information, and build connections with others, thereby fostering a sense of achievement and inclusivity-something that is difficult to achieve in the physical world of the Global South. We found that BLV players use mobile games as a resource to compensate for other accessibility limitations (RQ1). BLV players face challenges in games, including a lack of accessible tools, design limitations, and the need to invest more effort than sighted players. While BLV-specific games offer higher accessibility, their playability is weak, affecting the overall experience. On mobile platforms, these challenges often limit BLV players' engagement (RQ2).\nThe accessibility level of mobile games directly impacts BLV players' experience. High-accessibility games enable deep social interaction and convey auditory information well, but have weak playability. Mainstream games with assistive features balance playability and accessibility, but come with higher cognitive costs and technical challenges. Despite strong motivation, mainstream games without accessible features make participation nearly impossible. The ableism of this design causes psychological harm, and only 4 of 32 participants continue to play. However, some players explored alternative strategies, and our participants expressed expectations for future mobile game design (RQ3).\nIn summary, our study makes the following contributions to the HCI community:\n\u2022 We investigate the unique case of BLV mobile game players by conducting interviews with 32 experienced BLV mobile players, gaining insights into their perceptions, barriers, and strategies for playing mobile games, and present their expectations for future mobile game design.\n\u2022 We examine the factors influencing BLV players' choice of mobile games by comparing the impact of different types of games on their choices.\n\u2022 We analyze how different levels of accessibility in mobile games affect the gaming experiences of BLV players, demonstrating their strong motivation to play mobile games and how they navigate or are hindered by the varying degrees of accessibility available within these mobile games."}, {"title": "2 Background and Related Work", "content": "Our research builds on prior academic studies on the meaning of gaming, mobile accessibility, and game accessibility. By combining insights from these areas, we examined how the accessibility of mobile games affects the gaming experiences of BLV users."}, {"title": "2.1 Gaming and BLV Individuals", "content": "The HCI community has increasingly focused on accessible gaming [42, 53]. Studies show that players with disabilities have similar gaming desires as players without disabilities, including enjoying fun, overcoming challenges, and participating in competition. [17, 88]\nPrevious Research revealed that BLV individuals often experience reduced well-being and increased feelings of loneliness [48]. Nair et al. found that games can serve as a medium to alleviate feelings of loneliness [68]. Cairns et al. explored the motivations of players with disabilities, identifying social connection, leisure, escapism, and enjoyment as key reasons for engaging with games [25]. Video games can promote social interaction, enhance emotional well-being, and increase feelings of social closeness [39]. Aguado-Delgado and colleagues further suggested that video games might improve the quality of life for BLV individuals, but this potential is hindered by the lack of accessible mainstream games [3]. Ensuring widespread, easy access to mainstream games for the BLV community remains a significant challenge. As a common form of gaming, tabletop games often rely on visual elements for communication, posing accessibility barriers for BLV players [7, 31]. Similarly, modern digital games frequently emphasize 3D concepts and visual elements, which are often incompatible with assistive technologies, creating challenges for BLV players during gameplay [8, 19, 97].\nCurrently, there is a growing body of HCI research aimed at enabling BLV individuals to play games [10, 11, 41, 86, 90], allowing them to experience more advanced computer gaming technologies and enjoyment. At the same time, industry efforts have been made to enhance computer accessibility, such as Microsoft's development of Microsoft Active Accessibility and the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative. However, these accessibility features have proven to be effective for desktop applications, but remain challenging to implement effectively for computer games [12]. Andrade et al. highlighted in their study of BLV gaming experiences that PC gaming platforms (e.g., Steam) are often difficult to navigate due to insufficient accessibility features [7]."}, {"title": "2.2 Mobile Accessibility for BLV Individuals", "content": "With the rapid development of mobile devices and the widespread availability of the internet, an increasing number of BLV individuals now have access to smartphones [1, 60, 83]. These advancements have empowered BLV users to connect to the digital world in ways that were previously unimaginable, allowing them to perform everyday tasks, such as communication, navigation, and information retrieval, more independently [55, 58, 72]. Mobile devices, with their built-in accessibility features like screen readers, voice assistants, and haptic feedback, have become essential tools for BLV users, offering new opportunities for engagement, social interaction, and entertainment [49, 57, 82, 83]. As a result, mobile technology has become a vital platform not only for improving accessibility but also for enhancing the overall quality of life for the visually impaired community [32, 56]. Previous studies have shown that BLV users have a stronger preference for using the mobile version of Facebook over the desktop version [73]. They are eager to use mobile devices to integrate into society and connect with their communities [32, 40, 94]. The accessibility of entertainment on mobile devices is crucial to the quality of life for BLV individuals [16, 22, 32, 40, 45, 59, 94]. BLV users actively engage in online entertainment activities such as live streaming to achieve social inclusion [45, 77]. Additionally, they rely on mobile devices for online shopping and socializing, helping to reduce loneliness and overcome barriers commonly encountered in offline environments [4].\nIn many regions of the Southern Hemisphere, mobile phones are often the only accessible or affordable technology for a significant portion of the population, including those with visual impairments. Due to the high cost, limited availability, and steep learning curve associated with other devices, mobile phones, with their relatively affordable price, wide availability, and user-friendly interface, have become an important alternative assistive device for the BLV community. [1]. Notably, 95% of BLV internet users in China are proficient in operating mobile phones [28].\nHowever, the current accessible features on mobile devices have limitations, such as the lack of advanced screen readers or limited haptic feedback. These limitations restrict the user experience, especially when performing complex operations and interactions, highlighting the urgency of addressing accessibility issues [74]. Furthermore, the availability of accessible apps and services in local languages is often restricted, exacerbating the digital divide and making it more difficult for Global South BLV users to fully participate in the digital world [15]. Most touchscreens lack audio or tactile feedback, making it difficult for BLV users to locate items on the screen, requiring additional time and effort to search for information [22]. Sometimes, they may even search for things that do not exist, a phenomenon scholars refer to as \"not knowing what you don't know\" [18]. Research indicates that the main challenges BLV users face when using the internet include slow page loading, lack of alternative formats, complex information architecture, and broken links [18].\nThis issue is even more pronounced in the Global South. Visual impairment disproportionately affects populations in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of those with visual disabilities are found [1, 20]. In addition, the challenges related to accessibility are compounded by the widespread reliance on mobile devices as the primary means of accessing information and services in Global South [30]. Therefore, improving the accessibility of mobile devices, especially in the entertainment and social domains, has become an urgent issue to address in these regions.\nIn recent years, mobile games have dominated the global gaming market, holding the largest market share. In 2024, the global mobile gaming market is expected to generate $98.74 billion in revenue. According to Statista, the market size of mobile games is expected to continue growing, reaching $118 billion by 2027 [93]. However, despite the attention given to the accessibility of live streaming and social platforms for BLV users, the accessibility of mobile games remains underexplore in the literature. As the mobile gaming market continues to grow, it is becoming increasingly important to enhance its accessibility for BLV users."}, {"title": "2.3 Accessibility Gaming Tools for BLV Individuals", "content": "Video games have increasingly become a significant medium through which people perceive and interact with the world, serving as an essential means to enhance user well-being and foster social connections [14, 53, 87]. However, the strong visual focus of these games and their lack of accessibility result in a significantly reduced or deprived experience for a large number of users, especially those with visual impairments [63]. Previous scholars have argued that enhancing the accessibility of video games, enabling BLV users to have comparable experiences, is both a moral and legal obligation in today's information society [78].\nSome HCI scholars are working to develop innovative design strategies and technological solutions that make games more inclusive, such as incorporating audio cues, haptic feedback, and screen reader compatibility to replace or supplement visual information [13, 34, 44, 62, 65, 96]. Coronado et al. [29] proposed 35 guidelines for adapting games for BLV individuals, including meaningful and clear audio feedback, increased co-design with BLV users, among others. Despite efforts by many game companies, designers, and researchers to provide BLV users with gaming experiences equivalent to those of sighted players, achieving this goal remains highly challenging in practice [19, 21, 26, 62, 65, 79]. Most games accessible to BLV players often present an overwhelming amount of information, requiring additional cognitive effort to discern and filter useful content, which significantly impacts"}, {"title": "3 Method: Semi-Structured Interviews", "content": "We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 32 blind and low vision (BLV) mobile game players (P1 to P32) to gain an understanding of their daily lives and explore their experiences across different types of games. Each interview lasted around two hours, with six conducted in person and 26 conducted online. By focusing on their experiences with different game types, we sought to uncover their perceptions of playing mobile games specifically, as well as the barriers they face, such as accessibility challenges, game design limitations, and social factors that influence their gaming habits.\nWe also focus on the specific challenges and obstacles these BLV players encounter while engaging with mobile games, including issues related to game mechanics, navigation, and the lack of inclusive design features. We studied how these BLV players manage and navigate different levels of accessibility within mobile games, from those with full accessibility features to those with minimal or no accommodations for BLV users. Our goal was to understand the strategies they employ to adapt to these varying levels of accessibility, the impact on their overall gaming experience."}, {"title": "3.1 Participants: BLV Mobile Players (N=32)", "content": "We recruited 32 BLV mobile players participants through major BLV volunteer organizations in China, online BLV players communities, and specialized online forums and social media groups about gaming (e.g., Tiantanduping Forum, Zhengdu Forum, aimang.net). To participate in our study, participants must be 18 years or older, legally or totally blind, and have had prior game-play experiences with at least 3 hours per week in past one year. Our participant group comprised 23 male players, 8 female players, and 1 nonbinary player, including 26 individuals who are completely blind and 6 with low vision. Participants were aged between 18 and 45 years (M = 25.75, SD = 6.13). The interviewed BLV players were not directly compensated for their time; however, as per their preference, we purchased gifts for them. Based on cost differences such as travel expenses, the prices of the gifts ranged from CNY \u00a5100 to \u00a5150. The recruitment and study procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\nNotably, among the BLV players who participated in our study, 6 were unemployed, while 26 held various jobs, including 4 who were actively working as game designers. This diversity in employment status not only reflects the varied socio-economic backgrounds of our participants but also enriches our research perspective. Including game designers, in particular, provides valuable insights into the experiences of BLV individuals who are both users and creators of accessible gaming content. Detailed demographic information could be found in Table 1."}, {"title": "3.2 Study Procedure", "content": "During the semi-structured interviews, we began with demographic questions about their age, gender, vision condition, and occupation (5 minutes). Following this, we prepared a warm-up questions, encouraging participants to share insights about their mobile experience, school experiences, career paths, family, and any challenges they face in their everyday lives (25 minutes). Next, we inquire about their overall opinion with games, experiences with different types of games, with a specific focus on how vision conditions (including total blindness and low vision) affected gaming experiences (30 minutes).\nWe then asked detailed questions about their view of mobile games, each mobile game they had played and explored their specific experiences and feelings within these games, with a particular emphasis on understanding how vision conditions influenced their gaming experiences (40 minutes). Lastly, we asked about their expectations for mobile games and future game design (20 minutes)."}, {"title": "3.3 Data Analysis", "content": "In our data analysis, we employed a thematic analysis approach [23, 52]. This method was chosen for its flexibility and depth, enabling us to identify, analyze, and report patterns within the data while also considering the broader context and the participants' lived experiences. The reflexive nature of this approach emphasized the active role of the researchers in constructing meanings from the data, acknowledging that our interpretations are shaped by our own perspectives and the research context.\nThree researchers collaboratively analyzed approximately 65 hours of recorded interview data. The data was subjected to an open coding process, where the three researchers together reviewed the transcripts to identify and label meaningful segments of text. This process was iterative and involved multiple rounds of coding to ensure that all relevant aspects of the data were captured. We generated a total of 876 codes. Throughout the coding process, the three researchers engaged in continuous discussions to explore and negotiate any potential points of agreement or divergence in their interpretations. These discussions were crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of our coding framework, as they allowed us to critically examine each other's perspectives, challenge assumptions, and refine our understanding of the data. By fostering an open and reflexive dialogue, we could build a shared understanding of the emerging themes, ensuring that the final codes reflected a comprehensive interpretation of the participants' experiences and insights."}, {"title": "4 Findings: Perceptions of BLV Users for Playing Mobile Games", "content": "We first explore why BLV players choose to play mobile games. Our findings indicate that their preference is primarily driven by the widespread accessibility of smartphones in the Chinese market, the ability of mobile games to transcend spatial and temporal boundaries, and their portability. Additionally, mobile games serve as a means to alleviate boredom and achieve a sense of accomplishment that is often hard to find in other aspects of life. Moreover, mobile games provide BLV players with a better way to integrate into mainstream society, fostering social connections by enabling interaction with others and building a sense of community."}, {"title": "4.1 Why Mobile Phone?", "content": "4.1.1 Popularity. In the mobile era, the majority of respondents (N=32) are proficient in using smartphones, but fewer than half of the BLV players own a computer (N=12). As P27 mentioned, \"The operation of computers is very different from smartphones. Almost none of the BLV people I know can use a computer.\" P30 added, \"I spent a long time trying to learn, but I just couldn't grasp the tricks. However, when I started using a smartphone, I immediately learned because it's just a touchscreen.\" Unlike computers, which have a more complex operating system often combined with a keyboard and mouse, smartphones offer simpler touch-based interaction, which BLV users can easily learn.\nIn contrast, the inherent accessibility of smartphones is a significant advantage. Smartphones are equipped with voice reading systems or screen readers, which help overcome various challenges in information retrieval. Games that are compatible with screen readers are prioritized by visually impaired players, as this combination provides a smoother gaming experience, is easier to learn, and aligns well with the habits of visually impaired users. Additionally, P9 noted that smartphones have dedicated gesture systems that can be utilized in games. Beyond touchscreen and button controls, BLV users can use a variety of gestures to provide feedback and input information. The diversity of gesture types and their combinations enables more complex commands, significantly expanding the ways in which games can be controlled.\n4.1.2 Spacetime Flexibility. Among our respondents (N=10), computers are seen as being restricted to a particular physical space due to their large size and difficulty in portability. Respondents who have tried console or VR games (N=4) also believe that, apart from handheld consoles, other gaming systems always require some physical space to accommodate multiple components. P7, who frequently tests games on different devices, mentioned that the home-use nature of the PlayStation limits him to a specific space, making it the least favored gaming device. In contrast, mobile games require only a smartphone-something that almost every BLV user possesses. Mobile games also allow for online matching with other players, eliminating the need to rely on the already limited social networks in the real world. Participants mentioned that smartphones are easy to carry, and mobile games are quick to start and end, allowing users to complete all processes independently. P29 explained:\n\"While waiting for the bus, I can take out my phone and complete a game task. It's quick and simple, allowing me to relieve daily stress during fragmented time. Moreover, mobile games are entirely up to me; I can play whenever I want, without needing to rely on family or friends for assistance with navigation or additional tasks.\" (P29)\nThe convenience of smartphones makes mobile games virtually unrestricted by time and space, reducing additional travel costs and eliminating the need for physical space for gameplay.\n4.1.3 Portability. In terms of tabletop games, the lack of accessibility in physical environments forces visually impaired individuals to spend more energy exploring unfamiliar places. P3, P6, P14, and P22 had similar experiences. Despite having various tasks that require them to be physically present, and being accustomed to going out frequently, they still avoid playing tabletop games. P14 mentioned two main reasons: they feel anxious about navigating unfamiliar areas beyond their regular commute, and most tabletop game cafes lack accessibility features.\nParticularly, due to physical environmental limitations and limited social networks, they often struggle to find enough players to join in tabletop games. P29, a high school student from a special education school who is keen on exploring new and trendy activities, shared that many of his attempts to organize tabletop games had failed.\n\"Several times, we spent a week coordinating everyone's schedules... Some parents thought it was too troublesome and unnecessary, and others, even with navigation, couldn't find the exact location. In the end, we completely gave up on these kinds of games.\" (P29)\nIn contrast, the portability of mobile phones stands out as exceptional. P2 mentioned that in the digital media era, smartphones act as an \"external organ\" for everyone, especially for the BLV community.\n\"Compared to sighted individuals, we rely on smartphones to meet basic life needs. Without them, many daily tasks (such as payment or navigation) would be impossible.\" (P2)\nWithout a smartphone, BLV users would face considerable inconvenience, even being unable to complete basic tasks. This indispensable function not only supports daily life but also enables BLV"}, {"title": "4.2 Why Mobile Game?", "content": "We found that on a personal level, the motivation of participants to play mobile games is not solely due to the high accessibility of smartphones. Instead, they turn to mobile games to alleviate boredom, gain a sense of accomplishment, and foster social connections.\n4.2.1 Alleviate Boredom. All our participants unanimously agreed that although some BLV individuals with higher education explore careers in sales, software testing, or product operations, the majority of BLV employment opportunities remain focused on traditional fields, such as traditional Chinese massage therapy and music tuning. They argued that the limited employment opportunities often leave many of their BLV friends feeling trapped in repetitive cycles of monotonous work. Mobile games provide a valuable source of enjoyment for them and their friends. P16, a massage therapist, noted,\n\"My daily routine is massaging clients until late, which becomes monotonous. Mobile games, which are convenient and fun and I can play them during breaks at work or after my shift, bring me joy by allowing me to experience different careers and adventures, offering much needed relief from my exhausting job. \" (P16)\nMobile games provide a unique form of convenience, allowing P16 to seamlessly transition from his work to a world of adventure. As our participants stated (N=6), some BLV individuals in China who lack opportunities to choose their preferred professions and are unwilling to work in massage therapy often remain unemployed after finishing high school or university. For them, mobile games offer a way to alleviate boredom and bring a sense of purpose. P15, a 25-year-old who has stayed home since graduating high school at 21, shared:\n\"The tactile pavement near my home is often blocked by shared bikes... For me, mobile games open up a virtual world where, even without leaving the house, I can explore new places, feel the freedom of flying or running in games... Different games allow me tome to take on roles like a doctor, warrior, or chef! Making my time on the phone feel meaningful and engaging.\" (P15)\nTherefore, mobile games provide a convenient way to relax and transition seamlessly from work to leisure. For most of the participants (N = 17), mobile games offer not only a means to alleviate boredom, but also a sense of purpose.\n4.2.2 A Sense of Achievement Difficult to Attain Elsewhere. For many participants, video games create a space where they can feel competent and successful. The structured environment of a game allows them to pursue goals, overcome challenges, and receive immediate feedback, all of which contribute to a strong sense of accomplishment."}, {"title": "4.2.3 A Pathway for BLV Players to Mainstream Inclusion", "content": "Most BLV individuals in China grow up within the special education system, with limited opportunities to interact with students without disabilities, forming a distinct ecosystem exclusive to the BLV community. P19, a BLV mobile game player with twelve years of experience in China's special education system and four years at a U.S. university, mentioned that in her class in China, most students were blind or low vision, which meant they seldom relied on visual information and often discussed how sighted individuals might communicate about the same topics. P19 added,\n\"BLV people tend to be more direct and do not follow common social customs like handshakes or bows... Despite our strong desire to be part of mainstream society, there are few opportunities for us in China.\" (P19)\nTo BLV students, the special education system in China separates them from sighted people, making it difficult for them to interact with sighted peers. To adults, due to employment limitations, most people with disabilities work in environments where their colleagues also have similar disabilities, meaning that BLV individuals often interact primarily with other visually impaired coworkers. For many BLV players, mobile games have become a bridge connecting them to the broader world.\nBLV players also aspire to engage with more mainstream games, as a way to obtain information from the external world. More than half of our participants (N=24) reported experiencing significant delays in receiving information. P19 leads an alliance in one of these BLV games and interacts with many BLV players. She explained her observations:\n\"Sighted people can passively receive information at any time,but we have to actively search for information... So we often discover current trends much later! Back in school, I I loved reading sentences from youth pain literature. It was so popular at the time that social media platforms, driven by algorithms, kept recommending similar content to me. However, through discussions and interactions with others in games, I realized that my favorite style had been outdated for years. \" (P19)\"\nMost social media platforms utilize algorithms to enable personalized content recommendations. However, for BLV individuals, such mechanisms based on limited historical preferences often result in outdated information. In contrast, games, as interactive media, provide BLV users with a fresh perspective on information access. Through real-time interactions within games, BLV players can transcend visual barriers, share information, and discuss topics with global players, capturing the latest trends in their areas of interest. Thus, games not only serve as information exchange platforms for the BLV community but also as effective channels for keeping up with the times and acquiring cutting-edge updates.\n4.2.4 Fostering Deep Social Connections for BLV Users. The BLV community has a deep desire for social connections, and gaming serves as one of the tools to develop these relationships.\nMobile games help close the social distance between BLV individuals and sighted people by encouraging collaboration to complete tasks, while also providing common topics of conversation. For example, P4 enjoys playing mainstream mobile games like hide-and-seek and parkour with sighted players. These shared gaming experiences lead to conversations about mobile games in daily interactions and foster closer social relationships, enhancing her sense of inclusion in society.\nP19 described how she developed a close friendship while forming her alliance, explaining that she met her best friend seven years ago as teammates in a game alliance. They often played together, added each other on social media, and discovered a shared enjoyment in talking about life and hobbies, which led them to stay in touch and eventually become good friends over time.\nIn addition, gaming has become a breakthrough avenue for developing romantic relationships in the BLV community. Since offline social opportunities are limited, and they often don't know where to find meaningful connections online, games serve as a platform for making these connections. P18, who works as a media operator, once promoted a BLV game by highlighting how it helped people find romantic partners: \"Many people play this game because they heard that several couples met through it. I even posted some love letters from the game on our media promotion.\" P27 also confirmed this through his gaming experience:\n\u201cI once experienced a couple hosting a grand traditional Chinese wedding in the game's main city. The groom rode ahead on horseback, while the bride followed in a sedan chair.\" (P27)\"\nThis wedding left a lasting impression on the BLV player communities, and someone later shared an update, saying that the BLV couple had gotten together in real life as well."}, {"title": "5 Findings: The Impact of Varying Levels of Accessibility in Mobile Games on BLV Players", "content": "According to previous literature and the consensus among our participants, mobile games accessible to BLV users can be categorized into three types based on the availability of accessible tools (with built-in voice reading systems of phones considered default features and not classified as accessible tools): (1) BLV-specific mobile games; (2) Mobile Games with Accessibility Tools; (3) Mobile Games Without Accessibility Tools. Most BLV players engage with mobile games specifically designed for the BLV, which typically have no visual elements and focus on sound effects, making them fully accessible for BLV users. Some mainstream mobile games in China fall into the middle category of \"Mobile Games with Accessibility Tools\", as they include limited accessibility tools to assist BLV players in exploring these games. However, the majority of games on the market, which are designed primarily for sighted players, lack accessibility optimizations and present significant barriers for BLV users."}, {"title": "5.1 BLV-Specific Mobile Games", "content": "These games are specifically designed for BLV users and are referred to as \"BLV games\" within the BLV community. All participants (N=32) mentioned that they had not encountered operational difficulties in these games. BLV games are equipped with built-in focus systems that simulate human vision by capturing screen information. Players can select different screen readers to audibly read this information aloud. The menu options and other settings are designed strictly following the habits of BLV users, adopting a list-style arrangement to prevent users from getting lost in complex menus.\nAdditionally, BLV games include comprehensive gesture systems, such as double-tap to confirm, swipe left or right to switch options, and semi-circle gestures to exit. China's mainstream BLV games have generally adopted a standardized operational model, which has become a universal convention that provides players with a preliminary understanding of game operations. Specifically, this model begins by determining the game's orientation (portrait or landscape) and uses clear sound channels to indicate directions, laying the foundation for basic operations. The players then rely on these fundamentals to continue with the game."}, {"title": "5.1.1 Types of 'BLV Mobile Games'", "content": "Our interviewees (N=27) noted that, in China, card games, as the earliest type of BLV games, remain the most common form of gaming for the BLV community. BLV card game designer P1 mentioned that the cost of card game design is relatively low and offers greater flexibility in integrating accessible features.\n\"Card games, with their simple and clear rules, align with the thought processes of BLV users and are also more strategic, allowing players to strategize and plan. Hence, our company focuses on developing turn-based card games.\" (P1)\"\nAccording to BLV players we interviewed, in the past two years, some of the emerging BLV mobile games have been inspired by mainstream games designed for sighted players. This kind is different from the previously mentioned BLV mobile card games. According to P15, these BLV games are essentially adapted versions of popular mainstream games, retaining similar game mechanics and features while making adjustments for accessibility. They tend to offer high playability and have well-developed social systems, including official communities for sharing strategies.\nP15 mentioned a recently popular BLV game that is almost a copy of Genshin Impact, featuring a vast open world, real-time combat, and MMO elements such as world, guild, and team chat channels. This greatly enriched his gaming experience. \"I play almost every day. The game is both accessible and offers a unique kind of fun compared to what I've experienced before. Although it took me a while to fully grasp how to play, I feel it was absolutely worth the effort.\" However, as P15 pointed out, this kind of emerging BLV mobile games, which are designed to be similar to mainstream games, often have a higher operational threshold due to their extensive features and large scale. These emerging BLV mobile games involve many complex gestures and require extensive exploration. For designers, creating such games is also quite challenging.\nFor congenital BLV users, opportunities to experience mainstream games designed for sighted players are extremely limited. Many of them are only familiar with BLV-specific games, making them the most loyal audience for these games.

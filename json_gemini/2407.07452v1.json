Historically Bangladesh has been procuring weapons from China since 1975 when a diplomatic relation had been made with China. Bangladesh purchases 80% weapons from China because of its decent quality, lower price and easy to use. In addition, sometime Bangladesh procures weapons from other countries like Russia, Serbia, Italy, and so on. But Bangladesh does not purchase weapons from USA, UK, France, Germany because of its high prices which is not capable of Bangladesh defense budget as Bangladesh is a small economic country.\nBangladesh spends 6.3% on defense budget of its total budget, so its maintenance and other expenditures end up the major part of the defense budget.

However, missile defense is no longer limited to interception of strategic nuclear weapons. The gradual development and proliferation of missile technology has blurred the line between the technologies for the interception of tactical missiles (usually short to intermediate range with non-nuclear payloads) and the interception of strategic missiles (usually long ranged with nuclear payloads).

The SOVIET UNION achieved the oldest nonnuclear intercept of a ballistic missile warhead by a missile at the Sary Shagan antiballistic missile defense experiment formation on 4 March 1961.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, the United States Project Nike air defense program focused initially on bombers, then ballistic missiles. In the 1950s, the first United States anti-ballistic missile system was the Nike Hercules, which had a limited ability to intercept incoming ballistic missiles, although not ICBMs. This was followed by Nike Zeus, which using a nuclear warhead could intercept ICBMs. However it was feared the missile's electronics may be vulnerable to x-rays from a nuclear detonation in space. A program was started to devise methods of hardening weapons from radiation damage.[2] By the early 1960s the Nike Zeus was the first anti-ballistic missile to achieve hit-to-kill (physically colliding with the incoming warhead).[1]\nIn the early 1980s, technology had matured to consider space based missile defense options. Precision hit-to-kill systems more reliable than the early Nike Zeus were thought possible. With these improvements, the Reagan Administration promoted the Strategic Defense Initiative, an ambitious plan to provide a comprehensive defense against an all-out ICBM attack. Reagan established the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO), which was later changed to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). In 2002, BMDO's name was changed to its current title, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). See National Missile Defense for additional details. In the early 1990s, missile defense expanded to include tactical missile defense, as seen in the first Gulf War. Although not designed from the outset to intercept tactical missiles, upgrades gave the Patriot system a limited missile defense capability. The effectiveness of the Patriot system in disabling or destroying incoming Scuds was the subject of Congressional hearings and reports in 1992.

The final third of the arc comprises the missile's descent toward, and impact with, its target. Missile detection and defense Systems may be divided into categories based upon the intended portion of the missile's arc trajectory where interception is intended to occur. This method of classification is referred to herein as \u201ctrajectory trisection.\u201d\nPrior art Missile Defense systems have been directed toward intercepting missiles as they are descending toward their target in the final phase of the trajectory trisection category. One of the benefits of such a system is that Significant time is available to track the incoming ballistic missiles, calculate their trajectory, and distinguish decoys from actual missiles.\nOne of the major drawbacks of Such a system is that the incoming missile is relatively close to its target by the time Such a Missile Defense System launches an interceptor missile. If the interceptor missile misses or experiences a malfunction, inadequate time is left to take alternate defensive measures. In Such a Scenario, if the incoming missile contains a thermonuclear warhead, large Scale destruction and radioactive contamination will result. If the incoming missile detonates near a population center, millions of lives may be lost and billions of dollars in property damage is likely to result.

The Missile Detection System is the combination of both Hardware and Software. The Hardware consists of multiple sensors which detect different parameters of an incoming Missile. The detected signals by the sensors are eventually passed to the detection software for further processing. Finally, the detection software analyzes the data given by the sensors to find out actual information about the incoming Missile. Generally, sensors used in the Missile Detection System are of two categories: Ground Based Sensors and Space Based Sensors. An approaching Missile is a heated metal body which carries warheads. It also bears some smoke with it. Thus a system composed of metal detector, smoke sensor and heat sensor can identify the existence of an incoming Missile.

There are number of RADAR systems and advanced sensor technologies available in the present world. Though Radar is a potent device, especially in its advanced forms, it has a fundamental impotence as it requires that the communicator illuminate the target with energy. In doing so it identifies itself and betrays its location, not to utter of its vulnerability to deceptive. Electro-optical (EO) sensors, on the opposite side, do not have these deficiencies, as they are all passive, sensing energy emitted by or mirrored off the aim itself. We will discuss two of them which are the most important and effective ones:\n1. Pulse-Doppler Radar\n2.

It combines the facilities of pulse radar and continuous-wave radar, which were previously separate due to the complexity of the electronics. [5]\nPulse-Doppler system was first used on fighter aircraft starting in the 1960s. Initial radars used pulse-timing in order to accomplish range and the position of the antenna to decide the bearing. This functioned when the radar antenna was not pointed downwards; in that framing the reflection off the ground overcome any returns from opposite substances. As the ground moves at the same speed but in the reverse direction of the aircraft, Doppler techniques allows the return from the ground to be filtered. This gives pulse-Doppler radars \"look-down/shoot-down\" potentiality. An alternative asset in military radar is to lessen the transmitted power while achieving agreeable performance for more safety of silent radar."}, {"title": "Pulse Radar Operation", "content": "Most radar systems are pulsed, meaning that the radar will transmit a pulse and then listen for receive signals, or echoes. This avoids the problem of a sensitive receiver trying to operate simultaneously with a high power transmitter.\nThe pulse width or duration is an important factor. The radars operate by \u201cbinning\u201d the receive signals. The receive signal returns are sorted into a set of bins by time of arrival relative to the transmit pulse. The time interval is in proportion to the round-trip distance to the object(s) reflecting the radar waves. By checking the receive signal strength in the bins, the radar can sort the returns across the different bins, which correspond to different ranges. This can be performed while scanning across desired azimuths and elevations.\nHaving many range bins allows more precise range determinations. A short duration pulse is likely to be detected and mapped into only one or two range bins, rather than being spread over many bins. However, a longer pulse duration or width allows for a greater amount of signal energy to be transmitted and a longer time for the receiver to integrate the energy. This means longer detection range. In order to optimize for both fine range resolution and long range detection, radars use a technique called pulse compression."}, {"title": "Pulse Compression", "content": "The goal of pulse compression is to transmit a long duration pulse of high energy, but to detect a short duration pulse in order to localize the receive filter output response to one or at most two radar range bins. Early radars accomplished this by transmitting a signal with linear"}, {"title": "Pulse Repetition Frequency", "content": "The pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is the rate of transmitting pulses, on which receive processing is then performed. The higher the PRF, the greater the average power the radar is transmitting (assuming the peak power of each pulse is limited by the transmit circuitry) and the greater the detection range. A high or fast PRF also allows for more rapid detection and tracking of objects, as range measurements at a given azimuth and elevation can be performed during each PRF interval. A high PRF is also a disadvantage, which means it has a limited distance to perform unambiguous determination of range.\nRange to target is measured by round trip delay in the received echo. It is the speed of light multiplied by the time delay and divided by two to account for the round trip.\n$R_{measured} = V_{light} t_{delay} / 2$"}, {"title": null, "content": "The maximum range that can be unambiguously detected is limited by the PRF. This is more easily seen by example. If the PRF is 10 kHz, then there is 100 us between pulses. Therefore, all return echoes should ideally be received before the next transmit pulse. This range is simply found by multiplying the echo delay time by the speed of light and dividing by two to account for the roundtrip.\n$R_{maximum} = (3x10^8 m/s) (100x10^{-6} sec) / 2 = 15 km$\nSuppose the radar system sorts the returns into 100 range bins, based upon the time delay of reception. The range resolution of this radar system is then 0.15 km, or 150 meters. However, there may be returns from distances beyond 15 km. Suppose that a target aircraft #1 is five km in the distance and target aircraft #2 is twenty-one km in the distance.\nTarget aircraft #1 will have a delay of:\n$t_{delay} = 2 R_{measured} / V_{light} = 2 (5x10^3 ) / 3x10^8 = 33 us$\nTarget aircraft #2 will have a delay of:\n$t_{delay} = 2 R_{measured} / V_{light} = 2 (21x10^3 ) / 3x10^8 = 140 us$\nThe first target return will be mapped into the 33rd out of 100 range bin and the second target to 40th range bin.

The range ambiguity is analogous to aliasing during the sampling process"}, {"title": "History of Pulse-Doppler Radar", "content": "The initial radar systems failed to operate as expected. The reason was traced to Doppler effects that reduce performance of systems not planned to account for moving things. Fast-moving things cause a phase-shift on the transmit pulse that can harvest signal cancellation. Doppler has maximum negative effect on moving target pointer systems, which must use opposite phase shift for Doppler reparation in the detector. Doppler weather effects were also found to degrade conventional radar and moving target indicator radar, which can mask aircraft reflections. This phenomenon was adapted for use with weather radar in the 1950s after declassification of some World War II systems.\nPulse-Doppler radar was developed during World War II to overwhelmed limitations by increasing pulse recurrence frequency.

Radio wave roaming at the velocity of light, so the distance to the object is the elapsed time multiplied by the speed of light, divided by two - there and back.\nPulse-Doppler radar is based on the Doppler effect, where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the target.\nThe relationship between wavelength and frequency is:"}, {"title": null, "content": "$\\\\lambda = v/f$\nwhere:\nf = wave frequency (Hz or cycles per second)\n$\\lambda$ = wavelength (meters)\nv = speed of light (approximately 3 x $10^8$ meters/second)\nWhat happens in a radar system is that the pulse frequency is modified by the process of being reflected by a moving object. Consider the transmission of a sinusoidal wave. The distance from the crest of each wave to the next is the wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the frequency.\nEach successive wave is reflected from the target object of interest. When this object is moving towards the radar system, the next wave crest reflected has a shorter round trip distance to travel, from the radar to the target and back to the radar. This is because the target has moved closer in the interval of time between the previous and current wave crest.\nAs long as this motion continues, the distance between the arriving wave crests is shorter than the distance between the transmitted wave crests. Since frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, the frequency of the sinusoidal wave appears to have increased. If the target object is moving away from the radar system, then the opposite happens. Each successive wave crest has a longer round trip distance to travel, so the time between arrival of receive wave crests is lengthened, resulting in a longer (larger) wavelength, and a lower frequency.\nThis effect only applies to the motion relative to the radar and the target object. If the object is moving at right angles to the radar there will be no Doppler frequency shift. An example of this would be airborne radar directed at the ground immediately below the aircraft. Assuming level terrain and the aircraft is at a constant altitude, the Doppler shift would be zero, as there is no change in the distance between the plane and ground.\nIf the radar is ground-based, then all Doppler frequency shifts will be due to the target object motion. If the radar is a vehicle or airborne-based, then the Doppler frequency shifts will be due to the relative motion between the radar and target object."}, {"title": null, "content": "This can be of great advantage in a radar system. By binning the receive echoes both over range and Doppler frequency offset, target speed as well as range can be determined.

First, the spectral representation of the pulse must be considered.\nThe frequency response of an infinite train of pulses is composed of discrete spectral lines in the envelope of the pulse frequency spectrum. The spectrum repeats at intervals of the PRF.\nWhat is important is that this will impose restrictions on the detectable Doppler frequency shifts. In order to unambiguously identify the Doppler frequency shift, it must be less than the PRF frequency. Doppler frequency shifts greater than this will alias to a lower Doppler frequency. This ambiguity is similar to radar range returns beyond the range of the PRF interval time, as they alias into lower range bins."}, {"title": "Benefits of the Pulse-Doppler Radar", "content": "1. Rejection speed can be nominated on pulse-Doppler missile-detection systems. Therefore, nothing under the speed will be detected. A one degree antenna beam light up millions of square feet of terrain at 10 miles (16 km) range, and this produces thousands of detections at or below the horizon if Doppler is not used. [5]\n2. In airborne pulse-Doppler radar, the velocity threshold is offset by the speed of the aircraft relative to the ground.\n3. Surface reflections seem in almost all radar. Ground clutter generally appears in a circular region within a radius of about 25 miles (40 km) close ground-based radar. This distance extends much more in airborne and space radar. Clutter outcomes from radio energy being reflected from the earth surface, buildings, and vegetation. Clutter includes weather in radar envisioned to detect and report aircraft and spacecraft. [6]\nClutter creates a vulnerability region in pulse-amplitude time-domain radar. Non-Doppler radar systems cannot be pointed directly at the ground due to excessive false alarms, which overwhelm computers and operators. Sensitivity must be reduced near clutter to avoid overload. This concern begins in the low-elevation region several beam widths above the horizon, and extends downward. This also exists throughout the volume of moving air associated with weather phenomenon.\n4. Pulse-Doppler radar corrects this as follows:\na.

This is known as dwell time. [9] Antenna motion for pulse-Doppler must be as slow as radar using MTI.\n4. Search radar that embrace pulse-Doppler are usually twin mode because best overall performance is achieved when pulse-Doppler is used for areas with high false alarm rates (horizon or below and weather), while conventional radar will scan faster in free-space where false alarm rate is low (above horizon with clear skies).\n5.

Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of \"targets\" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric research. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydro acoustics.\nActive sonar uses a sound transmitter and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is mono-static operation. When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bi-static operation.

Use of an array decreases the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multi-beam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal dispensation, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement. It is"}]}

We created a case-study around an automated framework leveraging innovative natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) with a large database of patient portal messages to generate research ideas that prioritize important patient issues. We further quantified the quality of Al-generated research topics. To define patients' clinical concerns, we analyzed 614,464 patient messages from 25,549 individuals with breast or skin cancer obtained from a large academic hospital (Stanford Health Care, 2013-2024), constructing a 2-staged unsupervised NLP topic model. Then, we generated research topics to resolve the defined issues using a widely used Al (ChatGPT-40, OpenAl Inc., April 2024 version) with prompt- engineering strategies. We guided Al to perform multi-level tasks: 1) knowledge interpretation and summarization (e.g., interpreting and summarizing the NLP-defined topics), 2) knowledge generation (e.g., generating research ideas corresponding to patients' issues), 3) self-reflection and correction (e.g., ensuring and revising the research ideas after searching for scientific articles), and 4) self-reassurance (e.g., confirming and finalizing the research ideas). Six highly experienced breast oncologists and dermatologists assessed significance and novelty of Al- generated research topics using a 5-point Likert scale (1-exceptional; 5-poor). We calculated the mean (ms [Significance] and mN [Novelty]) and standard deviation (SDs [Significance] and SDN [Novelty]) for each topic. The overall average scores were ms=3.00 [SDs=0.50] and m\u2081=3.29 [SD=0.74] for breast cancer and ms=2.67 [SDs=0.45] and m\u2081=3.09 [SD=0.68] for skin cancer. One-third of the Al-suggested research topics were highly significant and novel when both scores were lower than the average.

For instance, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has actively supported patient engagement in observational health studies and advocated for incorporating patient-reported outcomes in clinical trials.2,3 However, there are barriers to capturing patient perspectives through traditional health research methods, particularly due to the high resource burden (e.g., time, money, and energy) without a guarantee for productive patient engagement. The incorporation of patient perspectives into health research has consequently been inconsistent.4,5\nOver the past decade, direct patient portal messaging in electronic health record (EHR) systems has become a mainstay of communication for patients to share their clinical questions and concerns with their clinicians. The use of EHR-based communications has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the volume of secure patient messages more than doubling from 2020 to 2024.7,8 While collecting patients' voices in volume is challenging and time- and resource-consuming, patient portal messages serve as a relatively unexplored resource for quickly identifying patients' clinical concerns and questions in real time.\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a probability-based language model that can extract key information from large quantities of text.9 With recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), \u0391\u0399- based NLP has been rapidly adopted in research to analyze large volumes of patient- or public- generated text data, such as social media or patient forum data. 10 Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in a variety of research-related tasks, including providing article reviews to peer reviewers and aiding in patient selection for clinical trials. 11,12"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Using a large database of direct portal messages from patients with cancer, we propose an automated framework that uses Al-enabled NLP methods to prioritize the most important issues that patients discuss with their clinicians and generate patient-centered research topics from these concerns.

Second, we guided the LLM to generate research ideas corresponding to those patients' issues (knowledge generation).

To score the significance and novelty, raters used a 5-point Likert scale (1-exceptional; 2-outstanding; 3-good; 4-fair; 5-poor), a simplified scoring system of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant review scale (1-exceptional; 9-poor). Each assessor had 10-30 years of clinical practice, extensive research experience, and familiarity with the NIH grant review process. The assessors were asked to rate the significance and novelty of the research topic based on the NIH grant scoring process. For breast or skin cancer, we calculated the mean (m) and standard deviation (SD) of three assessments for each topic to present the level of agreement among assessors using ensembling. 19\nFor novelty, we conducted an additional literature search to confirm that Al-generated research topics were novel. Two researchers (S.J.R. and M.P.) independently constructed search terms based on suggested research titles. The third researcher (J.K.) compared them and resolved conflicted search terms to finalize them (Table S2). Using the developed search terms, two researchers independently searched Google Scholar by relevance. We stopped screening the topic without reviewing all the search results and concluded that the research topic had not been published in the following two cases: 1) one of the search terms stopped appearing in the title and main text consistently for two pages, or 2) the 10th page in Google Scholar was reached. Given that the purpose of the search was to assess the novelty of the Al-generated topics, we did not perform a systematic literature search for each topic. Lastly, we reviewed the articles referenced by the Al-generated text to ensure that hallucinated content was not in its\nexplanation to justify knowledge gaps. To quantify the concordance of two novelty assessments, experts' scores, and literature search results, we assessed the correlation between these two novelty measures using Spearman's rank correlation test.

Approximately one- third of the Al-suggested research topics were considered highly significant and novel for both\nbreast and skin cancer. Notably, two-thirds of the Al-suggested topics were novel in both cancer groups. Research topics generated for skin cancer patients were more significant and novel overall compared to those generated for breast cancer patients. The findings highlight that AI/NLP-based research question creation is a promising way to promote patient-centered research tailored specifically to patients' most pressing concerns.\nCollecting patients' perspectives in volume is challenging due to the time-intensity of qualitative interviews and the resource barriers involved in conducting qualitative studies. Moreover, patient priorities continuously evolve, and the relative importance of different patient-reported concerns may not be clear during the conception of new research studies. As a result, there are significant barriers to designing and completing research studies that address the most important concerns facing patients. Our Al-enabled NLP pilot study provides a quantitative and repeatable way to identify the most important patient concerns, offering an opportunity to bridge patients' issues and health research. The Al-enabled NLP model allowed us to define and understand the top five clinical issues for patients with cancer through systematic analysis of 614,464 unique messages from 25,549 individuals in the past 10 years. Al-based research topic generation identified current knowledge gaps that were scientifically significant and novel research topics in patient-informed research.\nWe acknowledge limitations of our study. First, we generated 30 research questions for two medical specialty areas, and our findings may not be generalizable to other medical conditions or non-users of patient messaging. Second, we excluded patients' needs for administrative support (e.g., scheduling, medication refills, or insurance issues) and prioritized identifying clinical issues that were most relevant to patient-centered research outcomes. Separate research is warranted to identify patients' issues with health services to inform administrative support interventions, given their high volume of interest.

However, assessors' research and clinical areas spanned diverse subfields. We suggest further rigorous evaluations with larger sample topics in various specialty areas to incorporate diverse assessors and patient viewpoints. Moreover, evaluating patients' perspectives on Al-generated research topics would be critical to discerning genuinely essential topics for them. Exploring ways to invite investigators and funding agencies to collaborate on these topics inspired by patients' priorities would also be beneficial.\nIn summary, our pilot study illustrates how an Al/NLP-based automated framework can systematically prioritize patient concerns to inform patient-centered research. Our findings that the Al-generated research topics were high quality and scientifically novel demonstrate that using patient perspectives via large-volume patient message data can meaningfully guide future directions in health research."}]}

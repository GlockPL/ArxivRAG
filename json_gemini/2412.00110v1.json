The CT Foundation tool [1-3] provides embeddings for the NLST dataset and patient-wise training (N=10299 patients, 52696 images) and test (N=2199 patients, 11421 images) data splits. We trained different models (softmax and linear regression, linear sup-port vector machine, random forest, and decision tree) for predicting sex (N=2), race (N=3, fol-lowing previous studies [4]), and age. The performance metrics for regression were root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The performance metrics for classifica-tion were group-wise accuracy and AUC (Area under the curve) of the ROC (Receiver operat-ing characteristic). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

This information can either be useful for personalizing clinical decision support tailored to one's sex and age or could potentially expose the model to demographic bias propagation and security vulnerability risks. In both cases, our work highlights the importance of understanding what information is being encoded within foundation model encodings to ensure downstream clinical applications' safe and optimal development.\nOur results indicate that the CT foundation model embeddings encoded sex and age more ef-fectively than race. This may be because age and sex are biological characteristics with observable anatomical characteristics on a chest CT scan, while race lacks such direct biological representation in medical imaging. However, the race data in our study was predominantly categorized as \"White\" with 94% of the patients, which reduced the efficacy of our models in effectively evaluating the presence of race information in the embeddings. Nevertheless, our models show that sex and age are encoded in the embeddings.\nIn conclusion, as self-supervised approaches gain traction in radiology, it is essential to balance their advantages with strategies to mitigate any safety concerns. This was a preliminary study evaluating the ability of a single CT model to encode demographic information using embeddings from a single dataset. Continued exploration into understanding the information in foundation model embeddings will help ensure that AI in medical imaging progresses responsibly, protecting patient privacy and enhancing fairness."}]}

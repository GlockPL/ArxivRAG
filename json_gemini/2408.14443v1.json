Time terms s, t, u, v, . . . consist of time constants a, b, c, . . ., time variables x, y, z, ... (from a set Var), and the addition of these terms s + t. In Backus-Naur form (BNF), we define the following syntax for time terms:\ns, t ::= a | x | s + t,\nwhere a comes from a set of time constants, x comes from a countable set of time variables, and s + t represent the addition of two time valued terms. For conciseness, we write nt to represent the addition (+) of n copies of t:\nnt := t + t +\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7t. We write Term for the set of all terms.\nLogical formulas y consist of atomic propositions p, time-length indexed formulas ot, Boolean connectors (\u2227, V, \u00ac), time-length indexed modalities \u25a1ty and to, and existential quantification over time-lengths: \u2203x4,\u2200x\u03c6. We define, with t for time term and x for time-length variable:\n\u03c6, \u03c8 ::= p | Yt | \u00ac\u03c6 | 4 \u03c6 > \u03c8 \\ \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 | \u25a1ty | \u25caty | \u2203x\u03c6 | \u2200x\u03c6,\nwhere atomic propositions p come from a pre-defined set Prop. We allow the \"nesting\" of time-termed subscripts ot for an arbitrary TEL formula y, turning any such formula into a unary predicate (over time-lengths, or simply, time).\nWe call TEL a timed, monadic, first-order linear-time, temporal logic. From now on, we use the term \u201ctime\u201d with \u201ctime-length\" interchangeably. It will be clear from our semantic definitions that we refer to time as time- lengths, and it is not the intention of TEL to refer categorically to absolute time values. TEL is a (class of) time-indexed modal logic because the in- tuition forty and to is to capture the properties that o is always true until t time later, and 6 is sometimes true within t time in the future. For convenience, we abbreviate \u221e as, and \u25c7\u221e as \u25c7, where \u25a1\u221e stands for \u2227\u2200x6 and similarly,\u25c7\u221ey for \u25ca V\u2203xy, assuming that x does not occur free in 6. Alternatively, one could explicitly introduce \u221e as an explicit time term, with its usually intended meaning.\nNote that TEL is not a conventional monadic, first-order modal logic in that the monadic predicates are not supplied as a predetermined list of unary"}, {"title": "2.2 Semantics", "content": "To capture the formal semantics of TEL in the general setting, we describe the mathematical structure in which TEL formulas can be interpreted or evaluated. Our time structure is M+, where M is a non-negative commutative monoid M that contains 0, +. Such structures include positive integers N+, positive rational numbers Q+, positive real numbers R+, and positive p-adic numbers. We also require that such commutative monoid M comes with a total order < compatible with +, with the property that a < b if and only if a + c = b for some c > 0. The order < is further assumed to be non-degenerative, in the sense that for any x \u2260 0, a < a + x for all a \u2208 M+. The reason for considering positive numbers is for technical elegance for the most part.

In this section, we focus on the most natural case of natural numbers N\u207a, positive integers with the usual addition. In this setting, it is unnecessary to make a distinction between syntactic vs. semantic of integer time-length terms: they can be used interchangeably, so time-length terms u, v \u2208 Term\u0145+ are defined as:\nu, v ::= i \u2208 N+ | x | u + v,\nwhere x represent (a countable set of) time-length variables.\nThe alphabet for TELN+ is \u03a3 (= 2Prop), to account for all possible truth- status of each proposition in Prop at each given time.

The basic unit of the algebra is intervals on the real line, which can represent the duration of events, tasks, or actions over time. This algebra formalizes relations such as precedes (i.e., before) and overlaps to encode the possible configurations be- tween those intervals. Allen's Interval Algebra has been used primarily as a qualitative constraint language, with applications that involve planning and scheduling, natural language processing, temporal databases, and multime- dia databases. Halpern-Shoham logic (HS-logic [27]) is a well-known logical framework that incorporates Allen's Interval Algebra as a formal component of the logic. HS-logic contains modal operators representing Allen's binary relations between intervals that include: begins or started-by (B), during or contains (D), ends or finished-by (E), overlaps (O), meets or adjacent to (A), later than (L), and their converses. For example,  \u03c6 reads that \u201cthere is an interval beginning the current interval, in which holds.\u201d Therefore, the basic building block of reasoning in HS-logic is an interval, with its intrinsic expressive power grounded in the semantic structures [28, 29].\nTemporal Cohort Logic (TCL [17]), a precursor of this paper, was devel- oped to explicitly capture Allen relations as (binary) modal operators in the logic, rather than in the model (as in HS-logic). Formally, TCL formulas are defined as:\n\u03c6, \u03c8 ::= p | \u00ac\u03c6 | \u03c6 \u039b \u03c8 \\ \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 | \u03c6\u03a7\u03c8,\nwhere atomic propositions p are drawn from the same predefined set Prop.

One is for modeling and simulation in systems biology [30, 31, 32, 33, 34], and the other is for modeling phenotypes of biological organisms [2, 3, 17]. The work reported in this paper is motivated from the need to advance the scope of the latter.\nIn biology, phenotype represents the collection of observable traits of an organism, comprising morphology and physiology at the levels of the cell, the organ, and the body. Behavior and epigenetic profiles in response to environmental cues are also considered as a part of an organism's phenotype. In biomedicine, the term \"phenotype\u201d is often used to refer to deviations from normal morphology, physiology, or behavior. This latter notion is routinely used in clinical and healthcare settings."}, {"title": "7 Discussion", "content": "Given the extensive body of work and sustained interest in temporal logics, several remarks are in order to clarify the shared theoretical grounding and distinct features that differentiate TEL from existing logical frameworks, as well as open-ended research topics."}, {"title": "7.1 Trade-off of expressive power between syntax and semantic structures", "content": "There is in general a set-up decision between the syntax and semantics of a logical framework. The more rich and expressive the semantic structures allowed, the less need there is to enrich the syntactic constructs. On the other hand, the simpler the semantic structure, the richer the syntactic logical constructs are required to attain similar overall expressive power. Therefore, we consider the syntax and semantic structures together as a whole package for the expressive power of a logic. Minimizing both while still achieving similar expressive powers would be a worth-while goal for simplicity and elegance, as well as for applications.\nWe use several examples to illustrate this point. In HS-logic [27], Allen's binary relations between intervals are expressed using unary modal operators. Its semantic structure models the possible corresponding binary relations, with the computational complexity and expressive power mostly afforded from the semantic structure side [28, 29]. In HyperLTL [19, 20, 21], the expressive power comes from the extension of LTL by adding traces (paths) in the semantic structure, as well as by making the traces quantifiable in the syntax. In freeze-LTL [41, 42], the overall expressive power comes by extending (w)-words with associated values, and building in logical constructs to deal with data values."}, {"title": "7.2 Minimalist nature of first-order quantifications on time-length in TEL", "content": "In contrast, TEL uses the same semantic structures as those in LTL, formal- ized generally through a monoid M structure that covers discrete linear time and dense linear time. The only addition in syntax is the introduction of time-length variables and its first-order quantifications. Time-terms are ex- plicitly and independently defined syntactic entities with addition as the only required operation, in the form of s + t. We can then use first-order quanti- fiers and modal operators by turning any TEL formula o into a meaningful monadic predicate ft. Because of the simple and straightforward manner of the syntax and semantics, TEL can be readily enriched or modified to other settings, such weighted, metric, and interval logics."}, {"title": "7.3 Expressiveness, decidability, complexity, and spa- tial reasoning", "content": "Although we have established the undecidability of TELN+, many theoreti- cal questions remain. For example, what is the overall expressive power of TELN+ in terms of the language class defined by TELN+-formulas? It seems anticipatable that TELN+ would be able to capture, in addition to w-regular languages [24], other types of w-languages constructed using the approach of various types of w-automata [18].\nWhat is the value and consequence of explicitly incorporating subtraction (-) or past into time-length terms (s \u2013 t; with positive results required)? There are several studies that highlight the incorporation of \u201cpast\u201d being a line between decidability and undecidability (e.g., [43, 44]), but that should not completely deter us from incorporating it as a construct in forming de- cidable fragments.\nWhat are the decidable fragments of TELN+? In general, decidability results can be achieved by automata-theoretical constructs [22, 44]. Based on the development in Section 5, it seems that the negation-free, \u2203, \u25a1t, } fragment of TELN+ would be an interesting initial setting to study both the decidability and expressiveness properties [45].\nComputational complexity for decidability and for model-checking, etc [46, 47, 48], would be topics naturally motivated by application and implemen- tation needs.\nAdditionally, enrichment or modification through weighted [49], met- ric [50, 51], interval logics [52, 53], the formulation of TEL to spatial set- ting [54, 55] and the interplay between temporal-spatial domains a can be meaningfully explored."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "We introduced Temporal Ensemble Logic, a timed monadic, first-order modal logic for linear-time temporal reasoning with an intuitive and minimalistic set of temporal constructs.

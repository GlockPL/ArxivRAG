Sport, on the other hand, has become a constant companion of the modern human suffering a lack of a healthy way of life. The application of digital twins in sport has brought dramatic changes not only in the domain of sport training, but also in managing athletes during competitions, searching for strategical solutions before and tactical solutions during the games by coaches. In this paper, the domain of digital twins in sport is reviewed based on papers which have emerged in this area. At first, the concept of a digital twin is discussed in general. Then, taxonomies of digital twins are appointed. According to these taxonomies, the collection of relevant papers is analyzed, and some real examples of digital twins are exposed.

Introduction", "content": "Nowadays, breaking the premise between the physical and virtual worlds can be done using digital twins. The Digital Twin (DT) concept is a repli- cated digital model of any device, product, or process. The history of DTs dates back in history, while, nowadays, they are used in the real world, where many applications were already developed. Indeed, DTs are, nowadays, ap- plied to several areas, for example, the medicine domain [1], aerospace engi- neering [2], city planning [3], sport [4]. Since DTs are virtual replicas of physical assets, users can monitor real- time environments and perform various analyses. Data-making decisions are much more efficient, since they involve genuine, real-time data, which is crucial for efficient knowledge extraction from data. In many industries, it also allows users to design new products and digital replicas before producing a physical object, which also optimizes resources and costs. In Industry 4.0, and, later, in Industry 5.0, DTs can help optimize operations in production [5, 6, 7]. Also, in the recent era of global warming, they can help reduce carbon footprints during the optimization of processes [8]. Sports are physical activities that numerous people perform several days per week, primarily to maintain health, well-being, and relaxation. At the same time, countless serious athletes compete in different sports competi- tions [9]. Modern Information Technologies (IT) are also entering the world of sports and revolutionizing how people, athletes, and trainers perform dif- ferent sports. From the simple wristwatches, which were capable of mea- suring the heart rate in the late 90s, then, later, with the smartwatches that could monitor more parameters [10], e.g., GPS position, calories, and weather parameters, modern solutions emerged that can also give athletes advice during their training [11]. The main stepping stone lies in the data, which forms the way to make decisions [12]. Many decisions based on data are based on intelligent data analysis methods and tools, among which we can count Machine Learning (ML) [13], Computational Intelligence (CI) [14], and various processes and techniques under the umbrella of data science [15]. These methods can plan the sports training sessions [16], analyze the sensor data arising during sports training/exercises [17], generate sports training routes [18], etc. Not long ago, the concept of DT was also introduced into sports in different realms, e.g., as the role of a personal assistant during sports training sessions [4]. In this paper, we take a closer look at the DTs arising in a vibrant area of sports, sports training, human movement, and competition. Our goals are to review the current state of this research area, propose a taxonomy of DTs in sports, identify the main challenges and obstacles of this technology, and produce new guidelines for creating new DTs. This review article also builds on knowledge from previous review articles in this field, where the authors have captured DTs in sports and attempted to construct new knowledge mosaics. The following review papers [19, 20]"}, {"title": "2. Fundamentals of digital twins", "content": "A DT is a replicated digital model of any physical entity (i.e., device, product, or process) with the same behavior as the original ones. In Gart- ner's list from 2019, it belongs to the top ten strategic technology trends. The DT roots originated in 1960 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Apollo program [21], within which space flights were simulated in the virtual environment during the various astronauts' training phases. With the advent of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0, the technology was integrated into unified models (i.e., smart factories) that drive product design, manufacturing, and cyber-security [22, 23]. A concept of a DT is illustrated in Fig. 1, from which it can be seen that the DT integrates the physical and digital world with a complex data ma- nipulation. Data which arise during the data acquisition phase by a physical entity are transmitted to its virtual counterpart. Before being used by the DT processing model, they need to be fused with data from external sources (e.g., external databases, or the Internet), and cleaned during an aggregation phase. Indeed, the DT processing model models the properties of the physi- cal object. The majority of the DT applications needs a lot of services (e.g., Association Rule Mining (ARM)) that are incorporated into a DT processing model. The results of the DT processing model are represented in the action phase in different forms that serve to help decision-makers by accepting the complex decisions. The architecture of a DT consists of more components, working intercon- nectedly between each other, which, thus, determines the workflow of data across those. The components of the typical DT are as follows (Fig. 2) [24]:\n1. data acquisition,\n2. transmission,\n3. data integration,\n4. data preprocessing,\n5. processing model,\n6. services,\n7. actions.\nInterestingly, the first two components are devoted to sensing the physical world, while the last one affects it with actions. The third component inte- grates the physical world with the virtual one, while the next three represent an implementation of the specific DT. The data acquisition component allows acquiring data from various Inter- net of Things (IoT) devices, sensors, mobile devices, and wearable devices, with which a physical entity is monitored. The acquired data are then trans- mitted to the DT using network services. In general, the data integration component addresses problems of fu-"}, {"title": "2.1. Digital twins in sport", "content": "Sport plays an important role in human life. Moreover, modern sport can be treated as a surrogate religion or popular theater, in which people identify themselves with the sport's champions [26]. On the other hand, the modern sedentary lifestyle, and, consequently, the lack of activity cause obesity and loss of fitness by modern people. The lack of activity hurt them the most in the time of the Corona19 pandemic. The crisis had an especially bad effect on the younger generation. In line with this, the sport can help to improve those harmful influences on the modern lifestyle. Recently, DT technology has become increasingly significant in the sport domain, where it provides advanced solutions for sport training, performance monitoring, and strategical planning [27]. Indeed, the DT in sport presents a kind of human DT, where the human (i.e., the athlete) is placed in the center of the scene. Thus, humans are monitored in the physical world by various wearable devices and sensors, while the data acquired from these de- vices are transmitted to both, i.e., the real athletes and their virtual replicas modeled by the DT. These data are analyzed using the DT process model, while the obtained results are passed to the monitored athlete in the sense of an Augmented Reality (AR). The athlete then makes a decision on how to respond to a specific situation during a training session or competition. Interestingly, the DT in sport does not distinguish between the professional and amateur athletes."}, {"title": "3. Research Methodology", "content": "The goal of this review was to: (1) explore how digital technology is being integrated into sports training to enhance the capabilities of athletes and coaches, and (2) assess the extent to which these technological innovations are being implemented in real-world sports settings. Based on these objectives, the following Research Questions (RQ) were formulated:\n\u2022 RQ1: Which sports are supported the most by DTs?\n\u2022 RQ2: What is the level of maturity and practical implementation of DT technology in sports settings?\n\u2022 RQ3: How do DTs influence sports training?\n\u2022 RQ4: What are the challenges of implementing DTs in sports?\nA Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was the empirical research method to answer the research questions. The following SLR Guidelines in Software Engineering [28] were followed to conduct this review by us: We ini- tially scanned the domain by examining the relevant literature from leading digital databases in software engineering, prepared the SLR (conducted from April 15 to April 23, 2024) and developed appropriate search strings. During the initial domain scan, it became clear that actual implementations of DTs in sports are notably rare. There are only a few studies focused specifically on this area within sports. In contrast, most research on human DTs focuses predominantly on healthcare. Additionally, while DTs originate from indus- trial applications and are utilized extensively in sectors such as logistics and manufacturing [29], their adaptation to human-centric applications outside of healthcare, especially in sports, remains limited. We formed a search string based on two groups of keywords. Group one included the keywords \"digital twin\u201d (variation: \"digital twins\"). Group two included \"sport\" (variation:\"sports\"), \"fitness\u201d, \"coaching\", and \"virtual trainer\". Based on the keywords, the single aggregated search string used to perform the SLR was as follows:\n(\"digital twin\") AND (\"sport\" OR \"fitness\" OR \"coaching\" OR \"virtual trainer\") Variations in the search strings used across different databases were nec- essary, due to the distinct query languages and constraints unique to each scientific paper database. The queried databases are shown in Table 1.\nThe selection and exclusion criteria were defined clearly, and the lim- itations were considered carefully, to ensure a comprehensive and current understanding of the field. Thus, the selection criteria were as follows:\n\u2022 The research focused specifically on implementing or applying DT tech- nology in sports for athletes or coaches.\n\u2022 The research underwent a peer-review process.\n\u2022 The study pertained to sports as athletic activities demanding skill, physical capability, or competitiveness.\n\u2022 The research involved using DT technology or related computational methods, such as simulation modeling, artificial intelligence, or real- time data analysis, in the context of sports.\nWe considered the following exclusion criteria:\n\u2022 The research was not in English.\n\u2022 The full text of the research was not accessible through the digital library or any subscription services.\n\u2022 The research focused solely on recognizing activities from a leisure per- spective, such as general health.\nThe limitations of the paper selection were as follows:\n\u2022 The research was confined to six scientific databases/search engines: ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and SpringerLink.\n\u2022 The research needed to be published before April 15, 2024, which is when the indexing of potential articles took place.\nThe SLR Progression is shown in Fig. 3:\n\u2022 Phase 1: Initial search. In the first phase, we conducted an ini- tial search, which produced 739 results. Out of these, only 493 were available to be read in full-text form. During our preliminary research, we discovered that most works concentrate solely on the health aspect rather than sports, which led us to add an exclusion criterion: research focused exclusively on recognizing activities from a leisure perspective, such as general health.\n\u2022 Phase 2: Title-based screening. In this phase, three researchers reviewed the study titles independently. Their findings were combined to promote a well-rounded and impartial selection process. This step allowed us to pinpoint studies that were appropriate for the next stage of the review (67 results).\n\u2022 Phase 3: Abstract-based screening. In this phase, the abstracts and keywords of each study were reviewed carefully. The results were then aggregated, to identify studies that met the criteria (45 results), ensuring a focused selection process for the next review stage.\n\u2022 Phase 4: Full-text review. The full-text review was the subsequent phase of the SLR, yielding an initial set of 32 primary studies. After removing duplicates, we had a final collection of 24 primary studies.\n\u2022 Phase 5: Snow-balling. In the final phase, we used a related work review to identify additional studies through the snowballing technique. However, no new literature was found during this process, so the review remained focused on the 24 primary studies identified in the previous phase.\nThe results of the literature search analysis are provided in the remainder of the paper."}, {"title": "4. Detailed analysis of the DT in sport", "content": "The purpose of the analysis was to evidence details of the various DTs that were found in the collection of the papers, and to expose their main characteristics. The results of the investigation are summarized in Table 2 that, in columns, presents information like: (1) the name of the specific DT, (2) the data acquisition methods for exploring the physical world, (3) the DT model for simulating the real entity, and (4) the references to the papers where these were described, according to the particular sports discipline.\nThe following conclusions can be exposed from Table 2: The crucial differ- ences in DT implementations have been indicated by application in different sports. Thus, the biggest differences arise when comparing the implemen- tations of DTs supporting either individual or team sports. In individual sports, the DTs play the role of training assistant, virtual coach, or even educator. As a training assistant, the DTs try to enhance an athlete's per- formance and reduce their injury risks. The virtual coach DT simulates the tasks of real coaches, and, thus, tries to replace their role in the training pro- cess. Educator DTs replace either the real educators in physical education or teachers of artistic gymnastics. Usually, these application solutions are equipped with IoT devices, RFID tags, and wearable non-invasive sensors (e.g., ANT+ sensors). Recently, the DTs have been equipped with video cameras (e.g., DTCoach) and Kinect or motion sensors (e.g., in gymnastics, dancing, and education), where they try to improve the athlete's movement. On the other hand, the DTs, in team sports like football and basket- ball, serve as real coaches for improving strategic and tactical decisions or monitoring and simulating players' movements and health conditions in real time. Typically, these solutions explore the power of smart insoles and haptic feedback devices (e.g., a smart haptic display). Different NNs are applied for modelling the physical world. Thus, the shallow NN with only one or two hidden layers and an LSTM for dealing with data based on time series were discovered during the analysis. The primary characteristic of these NNs is the time complexity, and, consequently, these are not the most appropriate for use in real-time applications. Therefore, the more appropriate models are based on real-time analysis, MC simula- tion, and Hidden MM. Some models were developed especially for particular sports disciplines, for instance, motion sequence generation in gymnastics or Newton's laws of motion in swimming."}, {"title": "5. Taxonomy of the digital twin in sport", "content": "The characteristics of various kinds of DTs were, theoretically, well elab- orated [24]. Therefore, the taxonomy of DT in sport follows these hints. Indeed, the classification of DTs can be performed by considering more as- pects, such as, for instance:\n\u2022 types of DTs,\n\u2022 applications of DTs,\n\u2022 traits of DTs.\nIn the remainder of the paper, the exposed aspects are discussed in more detail."}, {"title": "5.1. Types of Digital Twins", "content": "Grieves, one of the pioneers of DT development, in his early study from 2015 [48], established that a DT consists of three components, as follows:\n(1) a physical product, (2) a virtual representation of the product, and (3) the bi-directional data connection from replicas of the physical entity to a virtual representation, as well as information and processes from the virtual representation, to a replica of the physical entity. These components form the so-called product life-cycle that can also be applied to DT development. Later, Grieves in [49] defined three types of DTs entering into the product life-cycle, as follows:\n\u2022 Digital Twin Prototype (DTP): A prototype that served as the initial model for the DT, often used in the design and development phase (i.e., system shape of the DTP in the virtual world only).\n\u2022 Digital Twin Instance (DTI): An instance representing a specific, in- dividual unit of equipment or system in operation that connects the virtual and physical worlds.\n\u2022 Digital Twin Environment (DTE): An aggregate of multiple DTIs or DTPs used for analyzing trends and performance across a fleet or sys- tem. The DTEs are categorized based on their functionality, as:\nPredictive: These DTs forecast future behaviors and performances using historical and real-time data, aiding in preemptive decision- making and strategy development.\nInterrogative: These systems focus on displaying the current and past states of the physical system, enabling users to query and understand historical performance and operational metrics. Actually, a DT model goes through three phases during its life-cycle [49]: At the beginning, it emerges virtually as a prototype, then, continues through its operational life, and, finally, it is eventually retired and disposed of."}, {"title": "5.2. Applications of Digital Twins", "content": "The area of DT applications depends on the level of product magnifica- tion. Thus, different types of DT applications can co-exist within a system or process. In general, regarding the type of applications, DTs can be classified as follows [24]:\n\u2022 Component: A digital model of individual components or parts within a larger system.\n\u2022 Product: A digital model of entire products or assets capable of simu- lating their behavior in different conditions.\n\u2022 System: A digital model of entire systems, offering insights into com- plex interactions.\n\u2022 Process: A digital model of entire business processes used often used in manufacturing or operational contexts. As can be seen from the classification, the area of application can lead to big differences in the implementation of the system."}, {"title": "5.3. Traits of Digital Twins", "content": "Traits of DTs refer to how similar/different are the characteristics of the implemented virtual replica when comparing it with the physical entity. The following traits of DT are found, as follows:\n\u2022 Same look as the original entity: The DT's look is the same as that of the original entity.\n\u2022 Different details of the original entity: The DT has the look augmented with different details of the original object, with which they supplement the total look of the effective replica.\n\u2022 The same behavior as the original entity: This trait enables a DT to behave and look the same as the original entity.\n\u2022 Prediction and information about problems that could arise in ad- vance: DTs with these traits are able to predict the problems that could occur in the future, and, consequently, try to avoid them. In general, human DTs in sport do not have the same look as the original ones, but operate with different details of the original. In other words, these DTs operate with the physical information that determines the particular human in the real-world, and, thus, mimic their behavior."}, {"title": "5.4. Summary", "content": "The proposed taxonomy of the DTs in sport classifies the collection of elaborated papers according to three aspects, as follows: (1) types, (2) ap- plications, and (3) traits of the DT.

A specification of the training session is obtained from the AST sys- tem in the form of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). The DT advises the cyclist during the training session with personalized guidance in the form of an AR via display connected to Raspberry Pi microcomputer, which is mounted on the cycle. A powerbank is used as a source of electrical energy. A DT model is implemented as a feedback system based on the simple mathe- matical model for prediction of the Heart Rate (HR), necessary to satisfy the requirements of the training session by the cyclist. Among other features, the AST Monitor is equipped with a variety of ANT+ sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi, like HR, power meter, and speed sensor, as well as a GPS receiver and a WiFi transmitter. The Raspberry Pi enable mobility, scalability, security, and connectivity, and, therefore, represents a promising platform for development of DTs in the future."}, {"title": "6.2. DTCoach", "content": "In the study from Diaz [31], a DTI is developed for real-time physical activity coaching on mobile devices, highlighting an interrogative DTE that provides immediate feedback based on user performance. This system utilizes edge computing to enable a portable and accessible coaching product that op- erates effectively on users' smartphones. The DT features advanced machine learning algorithms, including lightweight neural networks for pose estima- tion, tailored to run efficiently on devices with limited processing power. This capability ensures that users receive personalized training guidance directly from their mobile devices without the need for complex sensors or addi- tional hardware. The system's main advantages include its ability to offer real-time, personalized feedback, enhancing the effectiveness of home-based physical training significantly. Implementing this technology posed several challenges, particularly in optimizing data processing to function within the constraints of mobile technology. The solution employed pre-processing tech- niques to reduce computational demands, and ensure the system's responsive- ness. Additionally, the development team faced challenges related to ensuring data security and user privacy, critical when handling sensitive health data on mobile platforms.

In the remainder of the paper, the key benefits of DTs in sports are dealt with in detail."}, {"title": "7.1. Performance analysis and enhanced training", "content": "DTs integrate data from various sensors (e.g., IoT devices, wearable sen- sors) to monitor biometrics such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and muscle activity [4, 19, 40]. These data allows highly personalized training programs that adapt to the athlete's needs and conditions in real-time [39, 43]. The development of smart training systems gives us advanced simulations that help correct technical errors and optimize movements. For instance, DTs in cycling can simulate interval training scenarios, to advise the best strategies for improving efficiency and performance [4]. Another example presents sports like swimming, where DTs analyze un- derwater movements, in order to optimize techniques, such as streamline and dolphin kick, leading to significant performance gains [46]. One key aspect of training is psychological and motivational support, achieved by visualizing progress, setting realistic goals, and providing con- tinuous feedback. This helps maintain an athlete's motivation and adherence to training programs. On the other hand, they can simulate the psycholog- ical impact of different training and competition scenarios, helping athletes prepare mentally for high-stress situations [43, 50, 34, 36]."}, {"title": "7.2. Injury prevention and recovery", "content": "As many authors have stated, DTs enable detailed analysis of an ath- lete's biomechanics, help to identify potential injury risks, and correct his/her wrong techniques. For example, the use of sensors to capture detailed motion data and assess techniques, can pinpoint areas that need improvement and prevent injuries [19, 33, 40]. On the other hand, rehabilitation is an important aspect that needs to be covered. DTs assist rehabilitation by monitoring recovery progress and adjusting training loads accordingly. They can simulate recovery processes and design optimal rehabilitation protocols to ensure athletes return to their peak performance safely [40, 19, 51, 33]."}, {"title": "7.3. Strategy planning and competition simulation", "content": "DTs enable athletes and coaches to simulate various competition scenarios and strategies, especially in team sports, providing a powerful tool for opti- mizing performance. By creating virtual replicas of different game situations, DTs offer data-driven insights that help understand the best performance- enhancing approaches. This detailed simulation allows coaches of teams to make informed decisions regarding the strategy and tactics of the ongoing games. In line with this, the coaches can find the proper position for the player in the game, and, thus, they can ensure that every player's move is planned strategically and executed based on thorough analysis [42]. Moreover, DTs also play a crucial role in real-time decision-making in team sports like football. They simulate game scenarios as they unfold, al- lowing coaches to adjust strategically during matches. These real-time sim- ulations are driven by predictive analytics, which analyze ongoing gameplay to forecast potential outcomes and suggest optimal strategies. This capabil- ity ensures that coaches can respond swiftly to changing conditions on the field, making decisions that can impact the game's outcome significantly. By leveraging the power of DTs, teams can enhance their tactical understanding, and stay ahead in competitive sports environments [41]."}, {"title": "8. Challenges and opportunities for future development", "content": "Advantages in DT technology have connected seamlessly with growing challenges in areas like AI and IoT. Indeed, implementing DTs involves the following challenges that need to be addressed:\n\u2022 technical and setup challenges,\n\u2022 expertise requirements,\n\u2022 data security and privacy.\nTechnical and setup challenges include data acquisition, sensor setup, and creating a seamless link between the real and virtual worlds. Fault tolerance in sensors is crucial for maintaining accuracy. Expertise requirements refer to the proper operation of DTs, that require specialized knowledge and skills in both the technology and application domains. Ensuring the security and privacy of data used and generated by DTs is paramount, given the sensitive nature of the data involved. In the remainder of the section, the mentioned challenges are discussed in more detail."}, {"title": "8.1. Technical and Setup Challenges", "content": "The first challenge refers to the following issues:\n\u2022 interoperability and standardization,\n\u2022 data acquisition and sensor setup,\n\u2022 scalability,\n\u2022 user-friendly interfaces.\nEnsuring interoperability and standardization is crucial for the effective im- plementation of DTs. Adopting standards like ISO/IEEE 11073 (X73) for personal health devices and MPEG-V for sensory devices facilitates seamless integration and data exchange, allowing various systems to work together without dealing with numerous proprietary data formats [40]. This inter- operability is vital for achieving plug-and-play functionality, particularly in Digital Twin Coaching (DTC) systems, where standardized communication protocols enhance overall system effectiveness [19]. Standardized protocols like IEEE X73 also improve the reliability and robustness of Human Digital Twins (HDTs), ensuring seamless interaction and data exchange [51]. Data acquisition and sensor setup are critical for DTs. Advanced sensors like 3D accelerometers and bio-sensors capture physiological data accurately, while IoT devices, including smart wearables and RFIDs, gather comprehen- sive health and environmental data. Proper placement and synchronization of these sensors ensure reliable data capture and real-time communication [35]. Handling numerous Personalized Digital Twins (PDTs) requires signifi- cant resources, due to the complex interactions and frequent updates needed to reflect physical changes. Managing large data volumes and multiple par- ticipants is critical for success in broader applications [50]. Creating user-friendly interfaces is crucial for the effective use of DT sys- tems. Simple and intuitive interfaces reduce the expert knowledge required significantly, making the technology more accessible to a wider audience. Incorporating features like clear visual feedback and compatibility with var- ious devices enhances user interaction and engagement. Additionally, using avatars and virtual assistants can improve the user's understanding and trust in the system [51]."}, {"title": "8.2. Expertise requirements", "content": "Expertise requirement challenges address primarily the issue of multidis- ciplinary collaboration.

Data security and privacy", "content": "Data security and privacy direct to the following issues:\n\u2022 data integrity and security,\n\u2022 compliance with regulations,\n\u2022 ethical data management.\nImplementing DTs involves strict measures to ensure data security and pri- vacy, focusing on data integrity and security, regulatory compliance, and ethical data management. Ensuring data integrity and security is critical. This involves using encryption, secure data storage, and protocols like SSL to protect data during transmission [35]. Adhering to regulatory standards like GDPR ensures lawful data handling, and maintains user trust and com- pliance. Ethical data management requires transparency and user consent, ensuring clear information on the data use to build trust [51]."}, {"title": "8.4. Opportunities for future development", "content": "The future development of digital twins presents numerous opportunities across various domains:\n\u2022 integration with advanced technologies,\n\u2022 enhanced data analytics,\n\u2022 advanced sensor technologies.\nAdvanced technologies such as AI and ML can enhance the capabilities of DTs in sports significantly. These technologies enable predictive analytics, real-time data processing, and more effective decision-making processes [19]. Another important domain is advanced data analytics, which can provide deeper insights into athletic performance, injury prevention, and recovery processes. By leveraging big data and sophisticated analytical tools, DTs can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, offering actionable insights to optimize training and performance [34]. The advance- ment of sensor technologies will enhance the accuracy and reliability of data collected by DTs. Innovations in sensors can lead to better monitoring of physical and environmental conditions, enabling more precise and compre- hensive digital representations [32]. DTs offer a powerful tool to counteract the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle. By creating personalized fitness programs, DTs can help individu- als engage in regular physical activity tailored to their needs and conditions. These programs can be designed to fit into busy schedules, providing real- time feedback and adjustments to ensure the most effective exercise routines. For instance, a DT can monitor your daily activity levels and suggest exer- cises that can be done at your desk or during short breaks, promoting a more active lifestyle [19, 40]. In addition to enhancing general well-being, DTs play a crucial role in supporting amateur sports. Many amateur athletes lack ac- cess to professional coaching due to financial or geographical constraints. DTs can bridge this gap, by providing the guidance and expertise typically offered by real coaches. Systems like the AST, supported by DTs such as the AST-Monitor, can simulate the role of a coach, offering tailored training advice and feedback [36]."}, {"title": "9. Conclusion", "content": "This paper reviewed the role and impact of DTs in sports. Our review began by discussing the general concept of DTs.

Four research questions were set in the beginning of the paper that are complete, as follows:\nAnswer to RQ1: Our SLR revealed that individual sports, particularly cycling, fitness, and football, have seen the most significant support from DT technology. Other sports, like shooting, dancing, swimming, and gym- nastics, have also seen the application of DTs, although to a lesser extent. Additionally, DTs have been applied in education, particularly physical ed- ucation, providing valuable insights and enhancing the learning experience (see Section 5).\nAnswer to RQ2: The maturity and practical implementation of DT technology in sports are varied. Some DT systems, such as AST-Monitor and DTCoach, are relatively mature and documented across multiple stud- ies, indicating a higher level of development and application readiness. These systems demonstrate robust real-world applications with practical training and performance analysis benefits. However, many DT implementations are still in the prototype or experimental stages, with ongoing research needed to enhance their scalability, efficiency, and integration into everyday sports settings. This suggests that, while DT technology holds significant promise, widespread adoption and standardization are still in progress (see Section 6).\nOur proposed taxonomy classifies DTs in sports according to their types, applications, and traits, providing a structured framework that can guide future research and development. This taxonomy helps to clarify the diverse roles that DTs can play in different sports disciplines and training scenarios (see Section 5).\nAnswer to RQ3: DTs enhance sports training significantly by providing detailed, real-time feedback, personalized training programs, and ad- vanced performance analysis. Integrating data from sensors and wearable devices allows DTs to offer insights into an athlete's biomechanics, phys- iological responses, and overall performance. This allows for training in- terventions, rapid adjustments during training sessions, and more informed decision-making by coaches and athletes. For example, DTs can simulate var- ious training scenarios, optimize techniques, and prevent injuries through detailed analysis. Using DTs in strategic planning and competition simulation further help refine tactics and improve overall performance out- comes (see Section 7).\nAnswer to RQ4: Implementing DT technology in sports presents sev- eral challenges. Technical and setup challenges include the need for standardized data acquisition methods, interoperability of different sensor technologies, and user-friendly interfaces.Ensuring the reliability and accu- racy of data captured by various sensors is crucial for the effective functioning of DT systems. Expertise requirements pose another significant challenge, as the development and operation of DTs require multidisciplinary collabora- tion and specialized knowledge. Data security and privacy are also critical concerns, given the sensitive nature of the data involved in DT applications. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maintaining eth- ical data management practices are essential for adopting DT technology in sports successfully (see Section 8). Looking forward, the future development of DTs in sports presents nu- merous opportunities. Integrating advanced technologies such as artificial in- telligence and machine learning can further enhance the capabilities of DTs. Improved data analytics and advancements in sensor technology will lead to more accurate and reliable digital models. These developments promise to refine the effectiveness of DTs, making them an integral part of sports training and performance optimization. In summary, while the adoption of DTs in sports is still in its early stages, their potential to revolutionize the industry is immense. As tech- nology evolves, DTs are poised to become a critical tool for athletes and coaches, driving advancements in training, performance monitoring, and strategic planning. It is important for DTs to be adopted in various sports, and to advance beyond the prototype stage into fully integrated systems. The ongoing research and innovation in this field will undoubtedly shape the future of sports, making it an exciting area for further exploration and development."}]}

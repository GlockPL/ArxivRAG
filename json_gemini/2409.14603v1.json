However, this rise also raises significant privacy concerns, especially concerning personal data.\nWith regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandating the \"right to be forgotten,\" it has be-\ncome imperative to develop mechanisms for removing private information from these models. Traditional unlearning\napproaches are often computationally expensive and can impact the performance of the model in unintended ways.\nThis paper introduces Brain Surgery, a revolutionary tool designed to enable any local AI model to become GDPR-\ncompliant through a combination of targeted unlearning and dynamic privacy management. Brain Surgery\nleverages Embedding-Corrupted Prompts (ECO Prompts) to surgically remove unwanted data while maintain-\ning the model's overall performance. The methodology is further enhanced with real-time privacy monitoring and\nblockchain-powered decentralized privacy management, ensuring transparency and accountability in data han-\ndling."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Knowledge Editing and Concept Unlearning", "content": "The challenge of removing specific knowledge from AI models has been addressed through various approaches, in-\ncluding fine-tuning and knowledge editing. However, most methods involve retraining or model-wide adjustments,\nwhich are resource-intensive and may lead to overcorrection or loss of generalization [Mitchell et al., 2022]. Recent\nadvances in local modification techniques have allowed for more precise knowledge edits, focusing on specific em-\nbeddings rather than retraining the entire model [Meng et al., 2022]."}, {"title": "2.2 Embedding-Corrupted Prompts for Unlearning", "content": "Embedding-Corrupted Prompts (ECO Prompts) introduce controlled perturbations to the embedding space as-\nsociated with specific concepts.

Let ec \u2208 Rd represent the embedding of a concept c, where\nd is the dimensionality of the embedding space. The goal is to iteratively modify this embedding such that the model's\nassociation with c diminishes, while maintaining the integrity of the surrounding embedding space.\nThe corrupted embedding e' is generated as:\ne = ec - a VeL(ec)\nwhere L(ec) is the loss function that measures the influence of c on model outputs, and a is a step size that controls\nthe degree of corruption. By iteratively updating e', we ensure that the influence of the concept c is reduced across\nmultiple layers of the model.\nTo ensure that the modified embedding remains within a feasible region, we normalize the final embedding:\ne =\n||e'll\nThis normalization step ensures that the corrupted embeddings maintain consistent magnitudes across the embedding\nspace, preventing unwanted distortions to the overall model structure."}, {"title": "2.5 Conflict Score Evaluation: A Formal Method", "content": "To measure the effects of unlearning and to ensure that related concepts are not inadvertently affected, we introduce a\nconflict score based on the model's ability to maintain consistency in its outputs.\nLet X represent the set of related concepts and Xu the set of unwanted concepts. After applying the Brain Surgery\nmethod to unlearn Xu, we define the conflict score Se as:\n\u03a31(f(x) = Yr)\nSc =\nXr\nXrEXr\nwhere f (xr) represents the model's output for the related concept xr, and yr is the expected correct output. 1(\u00b7) is an\nindicator function that evaluates to 1 if the model's output matches the expected output.\nA conflict score Sc \u2248 1 indicates that the unlearning process has not affected related concepts, while Sc < 1 reveals\npotential conflicts introduced by the unlearning."}, {"title": "2.6 Privacy-Aware Continual Learning: Technical Integration", "content": "In Brain Surgery's privacy-aware continual learning system, the model actively prevents embedding sensitive in-\nformation during both training and inference stages. The system dynamically adjusts its learning objective based on\nreal-time privacy constraints.\nFor each incoming data sample x containing features x \u2208 R, the continual learning system evaluates whether x\ncontains sensitive information by using a privacy-preserving objective function Lp(x). The objective is defined as:\nLp(x) = \u03bb\u00b7 ||Xsensitive||2\nwhere xsensitive represents the subset of features identified as sensitive, and A is a regularization parameter that controls\nthe degree of penalization for sensitive data.\nDuring training, if the value of Lp(x) exceeds a predefined threshold, the system triggers the Brain Surgery process to\ndynamically alter the embeddings associated with sensitive data. This ensures that no personal data is embedded into\nthe model without real-time monitoring and protection."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Modular GDPR Compliance Framework", "content": "At the core of Brain Surgery is a modular, plug-and-play framework that can be integrated into any AI system.

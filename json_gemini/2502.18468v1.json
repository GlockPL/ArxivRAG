Tools such as ChatGPT, Codium, Copilot, and Cursor AI assist developers in writing, completing, refactoring, and optimizing code to enhance productivity and improve performance [56]. However, LLMs also pose security risks, as they are trained on publicly available code, which may contain insecure practices [32]. This can lead to vulnerabilities in the generated code that malicious actors could exploit [33]. Furthermore, supply chain attacks targeting third-party services, particularly popular libraries such as npm packages, have increased dramatically in recent years [54]. The use of advanced AI models in software development may unintentionally support these attacks by generating phishing messages and attack plans [11]. Despite their advantages, LLMs can also perpetuate biases and introduce bugs, which can affect performance and raise ethical concerns [44], [19]. LLMs offer advantages in various fields, including healthcare, education, programming, improving communication, workflows, and knowledge discovery [51], [55]. Although LLMs cannot replace human programmers, they streamline tasks such as code writing, documentation, and bug detection, making them increasingly valuable in programming [41]. However, the widespread use of LLMs raises concerns about possible security vulnerabilities and hallucinations [25]. This paper explores these trade-offs with the guidance of developers in leveraging AI's benefits while mitigating associated risks."}, {"title": "Related work", "content": "Heibel et al. [23] discuss Malicious Programming Prompt (MaPP) attacks, where attackers manipulate prompts to make large language models (LLMs) generate vulnerable code. Despite improvements in model capabilities, these attacks remain effective across various platforms. The authors tested MaPP on seven LLMs using HumanEval and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and found that simple prompts induced vulnerabilities without affecting code correctness. In addition, the best-performing models were more prone to malicious instructions. Their findings suggest that enhancing models alone is not enough to prevent prompt manipulation attacks.\nSimilarly another author Derner et al. [18] analyzes the security risks of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, focusing on vulnerabilities in content filters and the potential for malicious use. This paper identifies risks such as harmful text generation, data leaks, and unethical content creation. It also highlights the importance of informing policymakers and industry professionals about these issues. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT's content filters and explore the ethical concerns surrounding its use. They conclude that current safeguards are insufficient, allowing for harmful outputs. The study recommends further research to strengthen safeguards and investigate the broader societal effects of LLMs.\nIn another paper, Oviedo et al. [39] discuss the advanced AI language model ChatGPT, which is widely used for tasks like customer service and chatbots. However, it has drawbacks, including the potential to provide incorrect or unsafe information that may impact user safety. This paper also evaluates ChatGPT's overall effectiveness in promoting safety in contexts such as phone usage while driving and stress management in the workplace.\nAlternatively, Jacobi et al. [24] emphasize that the increasing complexity and frequency of cyber threats necessitate updated approaches to strengthen Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks. One promising approach involves the use of artificial intelligence, particularly LLMs like ChatGPT and Google Gemini, to enhance cybersecurity guidance. Research indicates that ChatGPT generally provides more relevant, accurate, and context-appropriate advice compared to Google Gemini. While both models have limitations, this study highlights the potential benefits of integrating LLMs into GRC frameworks, especially when combined with human expertise to address complex issues.\nIn another case, Atzori et al. [9] examine on LLMs such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude, and Bard can be misused to create phishing attacks. These models can generate realistic phishing emails and websites without modification, allowing attackers to easily scale their efforts using malicious prompts. To counter this threat, researchers have developed a BERT-based detection tool that effectively identifies phishing prompts across various LLMs. BERT-based detection tool that effectively identifies phishing prompts across various LLMs.\nAnother author, Latif et al. [45] discuss previous research in code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs), which usually focus on functional correctness but overlook security. It introduces the SALLM framework, which adds security-specific prompts and metrics to evaluate secure code generation. While earlier studies mainly checked syntactic and functional accuracy. This paper improves on that by using a rule-based repair system to enhance syntactic correctness, resulting in better compilation rates, especially for GPT-4. However, the study acknowledges challenges like potential bias in manually created prompts and the lack of real-world task representation, suggesting that future research should improve datasets and security evaluation methods.\nMishra et al. [31] introduced FAVA-Bench dataset for fine-grained hallucination detection in language models (LMs), featuring a comprehensive taxonomy of hallucination types. The dataset includes span-level human annotations and responses from models like Llama2-Chat and ChatGPT. It comes from a number of different sources, such as the No Robots dataset, the WebNLG dataset, and Open Assistant queries. They developed FAVA, a retrieval-augmented LM fine-tuned for detecting and mitigating hallucinations, which significantly outperformed existing systems like GPT-4.

It automates common coding tasks so that devs can work together to solve problems."}, {"title": "Evaluation", "content": "Initially, GitHub served as an inline coding assistant that offered code suggestions based on the context of previous code. It primarily aids with boilerplate code, but now includes an in-editor chatbot that enables users to input prompts and codebases, receiving customized responses to their queries [9][31][19]. During an in-depth evaluation of GitHub Copilot on a computer vision project, several issues were observed, particularly during the debugging process [10][51][25]. Despite leveraging the GPT-40 model, Copilot's responses were often inadequate, with repeated hallucinations and redundant suggestions that failed to resolve the underlying issues[22]. During the process of using the capability that enables Copilot to combine codebases and files into queries, this issue became more noticeable[50][17][8].\nCopilot provides the capability to interact with the codebase of a project or link notebook files, the majority of the responses it provides are textual explanations, with suggested code snippets to be added in for good measure. It is important to note that the practical applicability of these proposals is restricted because they do not provide specific guidance on where or how to implement them[15]. Furthermore, the functionality that allowed users to directly apply suggested modifications (via the three-dot menu next to the response) frequently provided results that were ineffective in terms of resolving the issue. These observations highlight challenges in effectively utilizing Copilot's features in complex debugging scenarios."}, {"title": "User Feedback Overview", "content": "During our user survey, it was found that Copilot significantly reduces code review and refactoring time by 15 to 30 minutes per task. Furthermore, users rated the quality of the Copilot generated code as follows: 14.3% at 60%, 57.1% at 70%, 14.3% at 80%, and 4.3% at 85%. Its error identification effectiveness received an average rating of 3.85 out of 5."}, {"title": "Security Analysis", "content": "GitHub Copilot poses security risks due to its dependence on data sets and integration systems. The Enterprise version allows training on private repositories, which may result in unintentional data leaks if improperly handled, even if it is primarily trained on public repositories to minimize the exposure of sensitive data. Additional dangers may arise from sending sensitive requests to third-party services when using external integrations, such as Bing Search, for information gathering. Additionally, Copilot might duplicate vulnerabilities from its training data, advise out-of-date or unsafe dependencies, or conjure up nonexistent package names, all of which could lead to exploitation chances. Because Copilot can produce code fragments that look like copyrighted content without giving proper credit, concerns around intellectual property also surface. Best practices like code review, automated security tool use, and adherence to safe coding principles are advised in order to reduce these risks.\nRecent studies have highlighted potential security vulnerabilities in Microsoft's Co-Pilot could inadvertently expose confidential information, such as passwords and API keys, from its training data [22]. Also, Co-Pilot Studio has a major security hole (CVE-2024-38206) that could be used to steal sensitive information using a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack [50]. During the Black Hat USA 2024 conference, experts pointed out several security weaknesses in Co-Pilot that might permit unauthorized access to confidential data and corporate credentials [17]. One of the major issues involved in LLM is adversarial attacks, which occur when inputs are manipulated to generate inaccurate output. Even minor modifications to the input data can result in incorrect answers[16]. Another challenge is data poisoning, where harmful data is deliberately inserted into the model's training set, causing biased or inaccurate results[16]. Furthermore, there is a security threat from prompt injection, which allows attackers to alter the prompts given to LLMs and retrieve sensitive information[16]. Training can also introduce covert vulnerabilities or backdoors, allowing attackers to obtain unauthorized access to systems or controls [16]."}, {"title": "Case study", "content": "It is possible to use Github Copilot for fundamental analyses by a coding assistant, such as the generation of code, the explanation of code, and the completion of code.

ChatGPT has experienced data leaks, including a 2023 breach by OpenAI that exposed 1.2% of ChatGPT Plus users' data for nine hours [48]. Concerns have been raised about leaks involving conversations, personal data, and login credentials, potentially from hacker attacks or privacy policy violations[46]. ChatGPT data leaks happen when sensitive information is accidentally or intentionally shared with unauthorized people. Users may accidentally type confidential details into the chat, or there may be weaknesses in the handling and security of the data [42]. Sensitive information can include personal details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, financial data such as bank account or credit card numbers, login credentials, and even health-related information. The main risk comes from human error, where users may unknowingly share such personal or financial information, thinking the chat is safe. This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, legal trouble, and damage to personal or company reputation. To reduce the risk of data leaks, users should avoid sharing sensitive information, use strong passwords to protect their accounts, and consider using tools like the SURF Security Enterprise Browser.

However, they pose risks, particularly in terms of security vulnerabilities. Since they are trained on vast datasets, including potentially insecure or outdated code, they can generate vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, weak authentication methods, and poor error handling [1]. Developers must follow security best practices to avoid deploying unsafe code. Users have reported challenges with Cursor Al when using multiple files [27]:\n* File Version Hallucinations: AI may mistake current file versions for outdated ones, leading to redundant or incorrect suggestions [37].\n* Contextual Gaps: Without full folder analysis, AI struggles to understand multi-file contexts, leading to irrelevant or repetitive suggestions [37].\nThese issues highlight inefficiencies in the tool's management of file context, affecting usability and performance. Additionally, misuse of Cursor AI can degrade code quality. While the generated code may appear correct initially, small errors and inefficiencies can accumulate, undermining project quality. Cursor AI also has limitations, particularly with complex projects [20]. While it handles simple tasks well, it struggles with larger project structures, leading to incorrect suggestions and subtle bugs. Although effective for basic code, it delays with advanced needs, such as specific business logic or custom frameworks [20], creating a false sense of security for new developers who may rely too heavily on AI-generated code. Another concern is data privacy, especially for projects involving sensitive information.

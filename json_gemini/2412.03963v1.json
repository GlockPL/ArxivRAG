This study challenges prevailing assumptions by exploring how generative AI interacts with diverse forms of human capital in creative tasks. Through two random controlled experiments in flash fiction writing and song composition, we uncover a paradox: while AI democratizes access to creative tools, it simultaneously amplifies cognitive inequalities. Our findings reveal that AI enhances general human capital (cognitive abilities and education) by facilitating adaptability and idea integration but diminishes the value of domain-specific expertise. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that merges human capital theory with the automation-augmentation perspective, offering a nuanced understanding of human-AI collaboration. This framework elucidates how AI shifts the locus of creative advantage from specialized expertise to broader cognitive adaptability.

This technology offers both promise and peril: while democratizing access to creative tools, it also risks deepening cognitive and social inequalities. Scholars have highlighted generative AI's potential to augment human creativity in areas as diverse as writing, music, and visual arts (Noy & Zhang, 2023; Zhou & Lee, 2024; Nakavachara et al., 2024). Yet, others caution that such advancements may exacerbate disparities in skill valuation, favoring those who can effectively leverage AI while marginalizing others (Acemoglu et al., 2022; Doshi & Hauser, 2024; Lee & Chung, 2024; Eloundou et al., 2023). As Al evolves from a mere tool to a co-creator, understanding who benefits most from this transformation is increasingly critical-not only for individuals and organizations but also for broader societal equity.\nWhile initial evidence suggests that generative AI can enhance creative performance, answers to this nuanced question remain elusive (Jia et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). Some argue that AI could reduce inequality by leveling the playing field, allowing lower-performing individuals to close the performance gap (Eloundou et al., 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023). Yet, studies also suggest that much of the observed performance gain stems from participants relying heavily on Al-generated outputs with minimal human input, resulting in automation rather than meaningful human-AI collaboration (Noy & Zhang, 2023; Doshi & Hauser, 2024). This paradox highlights the need to examine whether generative AI truly democratizes creativity or amplifies disparities by favoring those already equipped with the skills to use it effectively.\nThese observations point to a broader tension inherent in Al's role in the workplace. Raisch and Krakowski (2021) describe the \u201cautomation-augmentation paradox,\u201d where AI can both replace human tasks through automation and simultaneously enhance human abilities through augmentation. This framework highlights that generative AI has the potential not only to automate processes\u2014 reducing the need for human involvement in certain elements of the creative process \u2014but also to augment human capabilities by enhancing creative and cognitive functions. These dynamics complicate our understanding of AI's broader impact, raising critical questions about its beneficiaries and its potential to reshape skill hierarchies. This distinction is critical for understanding how generative Al reshapes the dynamics of creativity and skill valuation. Will AI level the playing field, or will it widen existing gaps by privileging those with broader, more adaptable abilities? To explore these questions, we challenge conventional wisedom and offer a novel framework that redefines human-AI collaboration in creative tasks."}, {"title": "A Contingent Approach: Integrating Human Capital Theory", "content": "To understand the nuanced effects of generative AI on performance, it is critical to develop a contingent approach that accounts for individual differences in human capital (Becker, 1962; Rosen, 1976). Human capital theory, widely established in organizational behavior and economics, provides a useful framework for understanding how individuals' abilities and knowledge influence their interaction with AI (Lepak & Snell, 1999; Carpenter et al., 2001; Ployhart et al., 2011).\nWithin this theory, human capital is typically categorized into two distinct types: general human capital and specific human capital (Coff, 1997). General human capital represents cognitive abilities and formal education that equip individuals with versatile, transferable skills (Lepak & Snell, 2002; Ritchie & Tucker-Drob, 2018). These skills enable people to quickly learn and adapt across various tasks and industries. Importantly, general human capital fosters problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to work with complex information (Crook et al., 2011; Ritchie & Tucker-Drob, 2018). Because these cognitive skills are broad in nature, individuals with higher levels of general human capital are capable of navigating diverse environments and performing a wide range of tasks.\nOn the other hand, specific human capital encompasses specialized knowledge and expertise that is narrowly focused on particular tasks, industries, or domains (Baer, 2015; Plucker & Beghetto, 2004; Tu et al., 2020). This type of capital reflects deep, technical proficiency in a specific area, allowing individuals to excel in highly specialized roles that demand extensive training and experience."}, {"title": "The Augmentation-Automation Perspective on Generative AI and Human Capital", "content": "Generative Al's unique features\u2014its lack of agency and its expansive knowledge span\u2014 make it both a powerful tool and a complex variable in human AI collaboration (Rouse, 2020; Gilardi et al., 2023). These features interact differently with general and specific human capital, leading to distinct outcomes based on the type of human capital individuals possess (Pyatt & Becker, 1966; Plucker & Beghetto, 2004). The augmentation-automation framework provides a useful lens to understand this interaction, illustrating how AI either complements or substitutes human labor depending on whether individuals rely more on general or specific human capital (Raisch & Krakowski, 2021).\nGenerative Al's lack of agency requires human input to produce meaningful outputs, making it heavily reliant on the cognitive and evaluative capacities of users (Boussioux et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). This reliance means that the effectiveness of AI in creative, complex tasks is closely tied to the user's general human capital (Choudhury et al., 2020; Mariz-Perez et al., 2012). Individuals with high levels of general human capital those equipped with cognitive versatility, critical thinking, and broad educational backgrounds\u2014are better positioned to extract value from AI. They can assess, refine, and apply AI-generated content within complex processes such as strategic decision-making, design, and creative work (Agarwal et al., 2023; Hui et al., 2024; Rafner et al., 2023). Because these tasks require judgment, adaptation, and the integration of diverse information, AI acts as a powerful amplifier for individuals with strong general human capital. The lack of agency in AI necessitates that human oversight remains essential, meaning that those who possess broader cognitive skills will be increasingly instrumental in guiding AI towards producing meaningful, innovative outputs. This dynamic amplifies the value of general human capital, making it indispensable in an AI-augmented workplace.\nAt the same time, generative Al's expansive knowledge span allows it to access and apply information across a vast array of domains, fundamentally altering how tasks that traditionally relied on specific human capital are performed (Acemoglu et al., 2022; Anthony et al., 2023). In creative work, domain-specific expertise is typically acquired through years of experience, learning, and deep familiarity with the nuances of a particular field (Amabile, 2012; Lifshitz-Assaf, 2018). This expertise allows individuals to produce creative outputs informed by their specialized knowledge, which is often tied to domain-specific memory and learned associations (Baer, 2015; Bruns, 2013; Ward, 2008). However, generative Al's ability to synthesize nearly all human knowledge and understand complex connections across fields reduces the need for such narrowly focused expertise (Anthony et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). AI's training across vast datasets allows it to not only access deep knowledge in specific areas but also combine insights from multiple domains, enabling it to perform creative tasks that were once the exclusive domain of highly specialized experts.\nBy integrating these two key features of generative AI\u2014its need for human oversight and its expansive knowledge span\u2014with the augmentation-automation framework (Raisch & Krakowski, 2021), we can better understand how AI differentially interacts with general and specific human capital (Raisch & Krakowski, 2021; Einola & Khoreva, 2023; Lee & Chung, 2024). From the augmentation perspective, generative AI enhances the capabilities of individuals with general human capital. AI tools increase cognitive and creative productivity by providing vast resources for exploration, iteration, and decision-making (Luo et al., 2021; Einola & Khoreva, 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023). Individuals with broad, adaptable skills are better equipped to harness these tools, guiding AI in ways that enhance performance on complex, non-routine creative tasks (Meincke et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). In this context, the demand for general human capital rises, as the role of human oversight and creative input remains critical in realizing Al's potential.\nFrom the automation perspective, Al's expansive knowledge span enables it to perform creative tasks traditionally dominated by specific human capital, reducing the economic value of specialized knowledge (Einola & Khoreva, 2023). As AI efficiently generates creative outputs by synthesizing knowledge across domains, the demand for deep, domain-specific expertise among experts declines, while novices may find new opportunities to engage in creative processes (Dell'Acqua et al., 2023). The more AI automates creative tasks that rely on established knowledge connections, the less critical specialized human capital becomes in driving creative performance. This shift poses challenges for workers whose roles are defined by their domain-specific expertise, as AI's capacity to replicate or approximate these tasks diminishes the relative value of such expertise while simultaneously opening pathways for novices.\nBuilding on this foundation, we now turn to the development of specific hypotheses that stem from these key mechanisms and relationships."}, {"title": "HYPOTHESIS", "content": "We first posit that the use of generative AI enhances individual creativity, a baseline assumption supported by prior research showing Al's ability to boost productivity and creative output. Studies indicate that AI can augment creativity by generating new ideas, offering alternative solutions, and streamlining iteration processes in tasks like writing and consulting (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023; Doshi & Hauser, 2024). These tasks benefit from AI's strengths in synthesizing information, producing coherent narratives, and offering stylistic variations.\nHowever, in highly creative tasks\u2014such as flash fiction and songwriting, where brevity, originality, and rapid shifts in focus are key\u2014the impact of AI is less straightforward (Lee & Chung, 2024; Zhou & Lee, 2024). These tasks often demand novel ideas, emotional depth, and unpredictable shifts, traditionally seen as the realm of human intuition, raising questions about Al's role in enhancing creativity in such contexts.\nNevertheless, several core mechanisms suggest that AI could still improve creative performance in these highly dynamic tasks. First, AI's capacity to access and synthesize vast knowledge across genres, themes, and styles provides a wealth of inspiration, allowing users to explore novel ideas that might not be immediately apparent through human creativity alone (Marrone et al., 2024; Meincke et al., 2024). This extensive knowledge base enables individuals to combine concepts in innovative ways, potentially sparking fresh and unique creative outputs. Moreover, AI facilitates rapid iteration, allowing people to experiment with multiple creative directions (Peng et al., 2023; Nakavachara et al., 2024). This iterative process increases the likelihood of refining ideas and enhancing the final creative product. Therefore,\nHypothesis 1. The use of generative Al enhances individual creativity."}, {"title": null, "content": "Building on the first hypothesis, which posits that generative AI enhances individual creativity, we now consider how general human capital augments this relationship. The core of this argument lies in how individuals' cognitive abilities and education level interact with Al's capabilities, particularly in creative tasks, where novelty and adaptability are key (Harvey & Berry, 2023; Doshi & Hauser, 2024; Lee & Chung, 2024).\nGenerative Al offers a vast array of ideas, but it lacks the ability to independently direct or refine them\u2014relying instead on humans to guide the process (Acemoglu et al., 2022; Noy & Zhang, 2023). This is where general human capital comes into play. Individuals with high cognitive flexibility can more effectively interpret and integrate AI-generated content, drawing from a range of inputs and integrating them in unique ways (Tu et al., 2020; Meincke et al., 2024). In tasks that demand originality, those with higher education level are better equipped to navigate and synthesize Al's diverse offerings. For instance, in songwriting, an individual with broad knowledge might use AI-generated lyrics from various musical genres and styles, merging them into something fresh and innovative that goes beyond what AI alone could produce.\nAdditionally, the human role in providing oversight becomes critical. While AI can suggest numerous creative paths, individuals must exercise judgment to evaluate and refine these ideas (Anthony et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023). Here, the cognitive strength associated with general human capital enables individuals to make strategic decisions about which AI-generated ideas to pursue (Boussioux et al., 2024). For example, in fiction writing, someone with high cognitive ability may discern which AI-generated plot elements will best enhance the emotional resonance or thematic complexity of the story, resulting in a more compelling final product.\nFurthermore, AI's ability to draw on a vast expanse of knowledge across fields is most effectively utilized by individuals with a similarly broad base of knowledge (Jia et al., 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023). Those with higher levels of general human capital can connect AI-generated content to a variety of contexts, pushing creative boundaries further (Mariz-Perez et al., 2012; Dell'Acqua et al., 2023). In songwriting, for example, an individual might blend poetic, historical, and contemporary influences into their lyrics, creating something more original than either they or the AI could achieve alone.\nTaken together, individuals with higher levels of general human capital are not only better at guiding AI but also at leveraging its wide-ranging capabilities to produce more innovative and impactful creative outputs (Huang et al., 2024; Rafner et al., 2023). Their ability to adapt, evaluate, and synthesize AI-generated content enhances the creative process, making the relationship between AI use and creativity particularly strong for those with greater cognitive flexibility and educational background. Therefore,\nHypothesis 2. General human capital positively moderates the relationship between the use of generative AI and creativity, such that the positive relationship between Al-use and creativity will be stronger when individuals\u2019general human capital is higher (H2a: education; H2b: IQ)."}, {"title": null, "content": "In contrast to the synergistic interaction between AI and general human capital, generative Al may diminish the importance of specific human capital in creative tasks (Baer, 2015; Dane, 2010; Tu et al., 2020). Specific human capital, built through years of domain-specific learning and expertise, plays a vital role in producing creative outputs informed by deep knowledge (Amabile, 2012; Bruns, 2013; Teodoridis et al., 2019). However, Al's expansive knowledge span, coupled with its ability to synthesize information from diverse fields, reduces the need for narrowly focused expertise (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2022; Eloundou et al., 2023). This shift challenges the value of specific human capital, particularly in tasks such as fiction writing and songwriting, where AI can now perform functions once requiring deep, domain-specific skills.\nA key mechanism is AI's ability to automate routine elements of creative tasks. Much of specific human capital involves knowledge internalized through years of experience, such as understanding narrative structures or lyrical patterns (Zhou & Lee, 2024). For example, a professional lyricist develops an intricate understanding of lyrical structure, genre conventions, and thematic depth over time, applying these learned associations to produce high-quality compositions. However, generative AI, trained on vast knowledge corpus, can replicate these established techniques, reducing the need for domain-specific human intervention. Al's proficiency in producing creative outputs that follow conventional structures undermines the unique value that specific human capital once offered, especially in formulaic aspects of creativity.\nAdditionally, AI's ability to draw from a wide array of knowledge domains goes beyond the more constrained scope of specific human capital (Yin et al., 2024; Zhou & Lee, 2024). While domain-specific experts focus on the nuances of their particular field, AI can integrate diverse insights across disciplines, broadening creative possibilities (Luo et al., 2021; Lee & Chung, 2024). The fixed nature of specific human capital, often referred to as the curse of knowledge (Camerer et al., 1989), may limit flexibility in exploring ideas beyond familiar frameworks. For example, experts deeply rooted in their field may overlook novel ideas that lie outside their established knowledge base, especially when AI suggests unconventional combinations (Dane, 2010; Miller et al., 2006; Ward, 2008; Schillebeeckx et al., 2019). AI's lack of agency, requiring human oversight, further complicates this interaction, as specialists may rely too heavily on their own expertise, missing out on creative possibilities that don't align with their domain-specific knowledge (Amabile, 1985; Lawless & Kulikowich, 2006; Rietzschel et al., 2007).\nFurthermore, the distinctiveness of specific skills, often developed through extensive training (Tu et al., 2020), becomes less critical when AI can replicate them at scale (Huang et al., 2024). The value of deep expertise, once a significant advantage in creative fields, is diminished when AI can produce outputs that rival or exceed the quality of those created by human experts (Doshi & Hauser, 2024; Zhou & Lee, 2024). AI's ability to emulate specific techniques and structures reduces the competitive edge of those with domain-specific skills, as the unique contributions of such expertise are no longer as essential to the creative process (Harvey & Kou, 2013; Agarwal et al., 2023).\nAs AI automates routine tasks, integrates diverse knowledge, and offers creative solutions beyond the confines of specific expertise, the traditional advantages of specific human capital is diminished (Puranam, 2021; Marrone et al., 2024).\nHypothesis 3. Specific human capital negatively moderates the relationship between the use of generative AI and creativity, such that the positive relationship between Al-use and creativity will be weaker when the individuals' specific human capital is higher."}, {"title": "OVERVIEW OF STUDIES", "content": "We conducted two experiments to test the effects of generative AI on creativity and the moderating roles of general and specific human capital. Study 1 focused on flash-fiction writing, while Study 2 extended this investigation to a lyric-writing task, addressing the limitations of the first study and examining the interaction effects between AI use and human capital on creativity (see Figure 1 and Figure 2 for detailed experiment designs). In both studies, participants were randomly assigned to either use generative AI or complete the task independently. The AI tool was deployed via a user-friendly, dialogue-based interface built using OpenAI's API (GPT-4), allowing participants to interact seamlessly with the system (see Figure 3 for the interface of the used AI tool). By employing distinct creative contexts across the two studies, we aimed to capture a broader understanding of how AI influences creative output and how this relationship is moderated by individual differences in human capital."}, {"title": "EXPERIMENT 1", "content": "Samples and Procedures\nWe recruited participants with a shared interest in story creation, through various channels including social media and online interest-based groups, ensuring a diverse sample comprising university students and professionals across various industries in China. Participants signed up our experiment and paid visit to our behavioral lab in schedule. 162 individuals participated in the first experiment, each compensated 30 CNY. Of the final sample, 111 (68.52%) were female, with an average age of 26.27 years (SD = 5.62). The majority, 154 participants (95.06%), held at least a bachelor's degree. Among them, 101 were college students, while the remaining participants worked in different sectors such as technology (8.02%) and education (6.79%).\nThe experiment was conducted in three stages. First, participants completed an IQ test and provided demographic information. Second, they were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: one group used generative AI (GPT-4) to compose a flash-fiction of under 500 Chinese characters, while the other group completed the task without AI assistance. Both groups were informed with basic fiction writing techniques and requirements. For Al-assist group, information about effective prompt crafting was additionally provided to ensure all participants could use AI. After the experiment, participants completed a post-experiment survey to capture their subjective perceptions during the creative process and received their compensations (see online Appendix A for measures used in survey).\nMeasures\nCreativity measure. We measured creativity using the consensual assessment technique (Amabile et al., 1996; Amabile & Pratt, 2016), following Berg's (2016, 2019) approach. We recruited an online panel of raters who evaluated the created fictions in two dimensions: novelty ($ICC^2$ = .90-.91) and usefulness ($ICC^2$ = .87\u2013.89). Novelty was defined as the extent to which the story presented novel and distinctive ideas, reflecting originality and uniqueness. Usefulness was defined as the degree to which the story provoked thought and conveyed meaningful insights or lessons, recognizing that its value may vary based on the context of the task.\nTo assess the quality of each story, we included an overall enjoyment rating from raters ($ICC^2$ = .89-.91) as an additional dimension. This measure complements the specific dimensions of novelty and usefulness, providing a broader perspective on the stories' impact. Overall enjoyment serves as a key indicator of how well the stories resonate with audiences. To ensure consistent assessments, raters participated in online training and received standardized definitions and criteria (see Appendix A). Ratings were made on a 10-point scale (1 = Extremely low, 10 = Extremely high). To mitigate potential bias perceptions against AI (Yin et al., 2024), raters indicated whether they believed each story involved generative AI (1 = Yes, 0 = No).\nGeneral human capital. Participants' general human capital was assessed through their educational attainment and IQ test scores (Pyatt & Becker, 1966; Crook et al., 2011; Mariz-Perez et al., 2012), both collected during the initial phase of the experiment. Participants first reported their highest level of education (1 = junior high school and below, 6 = doctoral degree). They took an 18-item version of the Raven Progressive Matrices test, which consisted of reasoning questions and had a 10-minute time limit (Sefcek et al., 2016).\nSpecific human capital. To measure the participants' specific human capital in fiction writing, we utilized self-reported assessments of their literary writing skills. This was measured with two items: \u201cHow would you rate your literary writing ability?\u201d (1 = Extremely poor, 5 = Extremely good) and \u201cCompared to your peers, how would you rate your literary writing ability?\" (1 = Significantly worse than most peers, 5 = Significantly better than most peers). The average of these two items was used to represent participants' overall literary writing ability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = .77).\nControl variables. We controlled for several variables to ensure the robustness of our findings. First, we included demographic factors\u2014age and gender. To account for personality traits, we controlled for openness, measured using Saucier's (1994) brief Big Five scale (8 items; e.g., \"imaginative and creative\u201d; Cronbach's \u03b1 = .83). We controlled for the frequency of Al usage (0 = never, 5 = daily) because frequent AI users may be more proficient with AI tools, potentially enhancing creative outcomes due to their experience rather than the experimental conditions. Separately, we controlled for participants' mind perception of AI, measured with an adapted scale from Yam et al. (2021; 8 items; e.g., \u201cAI can think,\u201d \u201cAI can plan\u201d; Cronbach's \u03b1 = .81), as individuals who perceive AI as more cognitively capable might interact differently with AI during the task, influencing their reliance on and utilization of the technology. To address potential biases related to participant motivation, we coded their motivation for participation (0 = monetary compensation, 1 = other reasons such as interest in AI or fiction). Finally, to account for potential evaluation bias toward AI (Yin et al., 2024), we controlled for the AI identification ratio, calculated as the proportion of raters who believed AI was used in creating each story.\nResults\nWe employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models to test our hypotheses. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations among the study variables, and Table 2 provides the detailed regression results.\nIn supporting Hypothesis 1, AI use was positively and significantly related to novelty (b = 0.403, p = .035), usefulness (b = 0.352, p = .032), and overall impression (b = 0.370, p = .015).\nHypothesis 2 posits that general human capital amplifies the effect of AI use on creativity. The interaction between AI use and education was found to be positive and significant for novelty (b = 0.480, p = .015) and approaching significance for overall impression (b = 0.309, p = .064), indicating that the positive effect of AI use on creativity is stronger for individuals with higher education levels. In contrast, the moderation effect on usefulness was positive but not significant (b = 0.295, p = .118). Simple slope analysis revealed that, for individuals with high education, the positive effect of AI use on novelty was significant (b = 0.774, t(149) = 3.25, p = .001). Conversely, this effect was not significant for those with low education (b = -0.010, t(149) = -0.04, p = .968), as illustrated in Figure 4. A similar pattern emerged from the simple slope analysis for the usefulness and overall impression dimensions, as shown in the figures in the Appendix F. These results partially support Hypothesis 2a.\nSimilarly, the interaction between AI use and IQ was positive and significant for both novelty (b = 0.193, p = .008) and overall impression (b = 0.140, p = .041), and approaching significance for usefulness (b = 0.106, p = .060). These findings suggest that the positive effect of AI use on creativity is stronger for individuals with higher IQ levels, supporting Hypothesis 2b. Simple slope analysis confirmed a significant positive effect on novelty when IQ was high (b = 0.869, t(149) = 3.04, p = .003), while the effect was not significant when IQ was low (b = -0.147, t(149) = -0.62, p = .537), as shown in Figure 5. Similar patterns were observed for the usefulness and overall impression dimensions, with detailed results available in the online Appendix F.\nHypothesis 3 posits that specific human capital weakens the relationship between AI use and creativity. The interaction between AI use and specific human capital was negative and significant for usefulness (b = -0.600, p = .003) and overall impression (b = -0.404, p = .047), suggesting that the positive effect of AI use on creativity is diminished among individuals with higher levels of specific human capital. Although the moderation effect on novelty was negative, it was not significant (b = -0.341, p = .169). Further analysis revealed that for the usefulness dimension, the simple slope was positive and significantly when writing skills were low (b = 0.706, t(149) = 3.49, p = .001), but not significant when writing skills were high (b = -0.065, t(149) = -0.31, p = .758), as shown in Figure 6. Similar patterns were observed for novelty and overall impression. These findings collectively suggest partial support for Hypothesis 3.\nSupplementary Analysis\nBuilding on our main hypotheses, we conducted additional analyses to deepen our understanding of the effects of AI on creativity. First, we investigated whether individuals with varying levels of general and specific human capital interacted with AI differently in terms of style or mode. We conducted mean split analyses to categorize participants into high and low groups for both specific and general human capital. Specific human capital, measured by self-reported writing skills, was split at the mean score of 3.26 (SD = 0.64, Nlow = 54, Nhigh = 57). Independent samples t-tests revealed no significant differences between these groups in terms of prompt length (t(109) = 0.923, p = .358) and the number of interaction rounds with the AI (t(109) = 1.075, p = .285). Participants were divided into high and low education groups based on a mean of 4.59 (SD = 0.82, Nlow = 52, Nhigh = 59). T-tests showed no significant differences between high and low education groups regarding prompt length (t(109) = -1.403, p = .164) and interaction rounds (t(109) = 0.897, p = .386). Similarly, for IQ, the mean split was at 15.56 (SD = 2.63, Nlow = 62, Nhigh = 49). T-tests indicated no significant differences in prompt length (t(109) = -0.194, p = .846) or interaction rounds (t(109) = 1.05, p = .916) between high and low IQ groups.\nNext, considering prior research suggesting that AI use may lead to increased similarity in outputs, we employed textual analysis techniques (embedding) to assess the similarity of the creative products. Interestingly, our findings showed no significant increase in similarity among AI-assisted outputs compared to those created independently, indicating that AI use in our study did not homogenize creative work.\nThird, we explored whether AI use impacted participants' cognitive perceptions of their creativity. Results revealed that using AI significantly reduced participants' psychological ownership of their creative products (b = -1.239, p = .001).\nLastly, to ensure the robustness of our main results, we conducted an omnibus test by including all interactions in the same regression model. The findings remained highly consistent with our initial analyses, and in several cases, the interaction effects became stronger. Together, these supplementary analyses contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the nuanced effects of AI on creativity, supporting the robustness of our main findings. Additional details are provided in the online Appendix D.\nExperiment 1 Discussion\nExperiment 1 demonstrated that generative AI significantly enhances creativity in flash-fiction writing, positively impacting novelty, usefulness, and overall impression. Notably, individuals with higher general human capital benefited more from AI, while those with higher specific human capital experienced less benefit.\nDespite testing all hypotheses, several limitations warrant consideration. First, the general nature of writing may dilute the unique impact of specific human capital, potentially explaining some insignificant moderation effects. Second, our assessment of specific human capital relied on broad self-reports of writing ability, which may not capture essential skills for novel writing, such as story development and emotional expression, leading to possible response bias. Third, participants completed tasks within a constrained timeframe in the lab, which may not reflect the extended periods typical of real-world creative processes.\""}, {"title": "EXPERIMENT 2", "content": "To address these limitations, our second study involves a lyric-writing task with both expert and novice lyricists, allowing for a clearer operationalization of specific human capital based on lyric-writing publication history. This study also spans one week, providing participants ample time to engage deeply with the creative process, thereby enhancing ecological validity and better mimicking real-world work conditions.\nEXPERIMENT 2\nSample and Procedures\nIn Experiment 2, participants were recruited from universities, companies, and online music platforms, ensuring a diverse range of lyric-writing skills, including individuals with prior writing and publication experience. To incentivize participation and engagement, each participant was promised a professionally recorded song composition based on their own lyric creation, in addition to receiving 100 CNY upon completing all stages of the experiment.\nThe participants were tasked with writing song lyrics, a key component of a song alongside vocal melodies and instrumental accompaniments. To support this task, we provided each participant with both a vocal melody and instrumental accompaniment. We prepared ten royalty-free accompaniment tracks in various styles, and two professional composers created vocal melodies for five tracks each, resulting in ten complete song demos. Each demo consisted of an accompaniment track paired with a vocal melody performed using \u201cla-la-la\u201d syllables (see the online Appendix B for delivered materials).\nAfter registration and an online IQ test (Nstart = 685), participants were randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted group or a control group that composed lyrics without AI support. Both groups received basic instructions on lyric-writing techniques, while the AI-assisted group received additional guidance on using generative AI (Ninformation = 611). Participants were assigned a demo file along with a simplified musical score of the vocal melody, which included annotations for lyric breaks and suggested word counts. This design aimed to engage participants effectively, regardless of their experience level.\nThe experiment was conducted online, allowing participants one week to complete the task at their own pace, closely mimicking typical lyrics-writing processes. Throughout this period, participants could listen to the provided melody and refer to the musical score as they composed their lyrics, facilitating a structured and supportive creative environment. After completing their initial assignment, participants were encouraged to write lyrics for the remaining nine demos. They then submitted their lyrics and completed a follow-up questionnaire about their experiences (Nsubmission = 348).\nSample attrition occurred primarily during the lyrics-creation stage, which had a dropout rate of 43.04% despite efforts to simplify the task. Among the submissions, 329 works from 299 participants were deemed suitable for song recording by professional producers and singers. Of these participants, 289 composed lyrics for only one song (96.66%). The final sample of 299 participants had an average age of 24.10 years (SD = 6.06); 191 (63.88%) were female, and 279 (93.31%) held a bachelor's degree or higher.\nMeasures\nCreativity measure. In Experiment 2, we employed a dual-method approach to assess the creativity of the composed lyrics, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation that captures both the intrinsic qualities of the lyrics and their reception within a musical context. First, we recruited an online panel of raters"}]}

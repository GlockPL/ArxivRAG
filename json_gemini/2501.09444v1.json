It highlights the initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the 1997 handover, a task mandated by the Basic Law. The effort involved significant collaboration among legal, linguistic, and translation experts, resulting in a comprehensive and culturally appropriate bilingual legal system. However, translating case law remains a significant challenge due to the sheer volume and continuous growth of judicial decisions. The paper critiques the government's and judiciary's sporadic and uncoordinated efforts to translate case law, contrasting it with the thorough approach previously taken for statute translation. Although the government acknowledges the importance of legal bilingualism, it lacks a sustainable strategy for translating case law. The Judiciary's position-that translating all judgments is \u201cunnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effective\u201d\u2014is analyzed and critiqued for its impact on legal transparency and public trust. A proposed solution involves leveraging machine translation technology through a human-machine interactive translation platform, which undergoes two major transitions. Initially based on a neural model, the platform transitions to using a large language model for improved translation accuracy. Furthermore, it evolves from a single-agent system to a multi-agent system, incorporating Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader agents. This multi-agent approach, supported by a grant, aims to facilitate efficient, high-quality translation of judicial judgments by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and continuous feedback mechanisms, thus better meeting the needs of a bilingual legal system.", "sections": [{"title": "I. Background", "content": "This year marks the 27th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China after 155 years of British rule. On 1 July 1997, when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) was established, it took pride in having all its written statutes translated into Chinese, a mammoth task which had been regarded by many as impossible. It was a task dictated by Articles 8 and 9 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the former stipulating the retention of the English common law system in the HKSAR, and the latter legal bilingualism, i.e., a common law system operating in Chinese as the default language of the law, with the optional use of English as an official language.\nArticle 9 provides: \u201cIn addition to the Chinese language, English may also be used as an official language by the executive authorities, legislature and judiciary of the Hong Kong Administrative Region.\u201d While Chinese and English are both official languages under Section 3 of the Official Languages Ordinance (Cap 5 of the Laws of Hong Kong), the wording suggests a subtle distinction in pragmatic meaning between the two. As part of China, it goes without saying that Hong Kong's legal system must operate in the language of the sovereign state,"}, {"title": "2 Chinese digest", "content": "However, having all the written statutes available in Chinese and English is by no means a full implementation of legal bilingualism. For written statutes represent only a small portion of the law of Hong Kong. The bulk is found in judicial judgments of cases decided by the superior courts of Hong Kong and other common law jurisdictions, known as case law. Such judgments are voluminous, and what is more, ever growing in number as cases are being tried in common law jurisdictions across the world every day. While only a tiny portion of such judgments are written in Chinese \u2013 they are all judgments of local cases decided in Hong Kong, an overwhelmingly larger portion are written in English. Thus, implementing legal bilingualism in Hong Kong requires translating all translating all English judgments into Chinese, and vice versa.\nGiven the comparatively small number of Chinese judgments, translating all of them into English does not seem an insurmountable task. In contrast, given the immensely greater number of English judgments, translating all of them into Chinese is apparently an impossible task.\nWay back in 1984, when China first indicated its intention to retain the common law system in the HKSAR as a bilingual legal system operating in Chinese and English, many legal experts already noticed the problem inherent in this policy. Henry Litton, who subsequently became a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal, pointed out flatly, \"There seems to be broad consensus in Hong Kong that the translation of the whole of the common law into Chinese is impossible, common law being that broad body of law derived from decisions of the courts in England, embodied in the law reports, and fed by sources as diverse as Australia, Canada and New Zealand\" [1]. And 38 years later, on 1 July 2022, he stressed the same point again, remarking that \u201cthere is no conceivable way that the vast bulk of cases constituting the common law could be translated into Chinese\" [2].\nThe first attempt to address the issue was taken up by a team of legal scholars and linguists in the run-up to 1997 before the handover. To get around the enormous amount of judgments that need to be translated, they employed \"the well-tried traditional technique of creating a digest of the common law\" [3]. The idea was to extract from relevant authorities the legal principle underlying judicial decisions on a particular issue and create a re-statement of the legal principle in question [4]. Three bilingual digests were produced (contract law: [5]; criminal law: [3]; criminal procedure: [6]). A huge number of decided cases concerning a particular domain, say, contract, are condensed into a"}, {"title": "3 Government attempts", "content": "While focusing its efforts on the translation of the written statutes before the handover, the Government did not overlook the need for the translation of the case law. In January 1997, it announced its plan for \"an overall co-ordination mechanism for overseeing the implementation of a bilingual legal system in Hong Kong,\" which included an item on common law cases.\nThe next year on 1 April 1998, it established the Committee on Bilingual System (CBLS) to coordinate efforts in implementing legal bilingualism undertaken by various public and professional bodies. And recognizing the importance of having the case law available in Chinese, it established a Subcommittee on the Translation of Case Precedents in December 1998 with the objective to produce translations of judgments for citation purposes. It was also responsible for identifying judgments for translation on a pilot basis, formulating strategies for the systematic translation of case law, and devising a mechanism for vetting translations by legal professionals [10]. Initially, 33 cases were recommended for translation by the Judiciary, the Bar Association, the Law Society, and the Department of Justice. Twenty-five were translated variously by the Judiciary, the Official Languages Agency, and the Department of Justice. The translation was completed within a short period of three months, followed by a report in which the Subcommittee discussed the problems encountered in the process and, more importantly, announced its long-term objective to develop a sufficient body of bilingual case law [11].\nStrangely enough, the Subcommittee seemed to disappear without a trace, there being no further information about its alleged commitments. But the translation of judgments remained a main concern of the lawmakers. In 2002, they raised three questions about the practice in overseas jurisdictions:"}, {"title": "4 The present situation", "content": "The initial success of translating all written statutes into Chinese before the handover in 1997 was a monumental task. This accomplishment demonstrates significant dedication and organizational capability on the part of the Hong Kong Government, in particular, the Legal Department (now the Department of Justice), fulfilling a requirement stipulated by the Basic Law. It is important to note that the translation project had significant input from legal, language, and translation scholars through the diligent work of the Bilingual Laws Advisory Committee (BLAC), a statutory body established by the Hong Kong Government to advise it on all aspects of the translation of written statutes into Chinese.\nIn the process of translation, a comprehensive range of issues relating to law, language, culture, and translation were revealed and explored. This extensive and collaborative effort underscores that translating laws from one language into another within a bilingual or multilingual legal system must be viewed as a social project that harnesses the full spectrum of relevant expertise in society. The successful implementation of bilingual legislation in Hong Kong is a testament to the coordinated efforts of various professionals and scholars, reflecting a commitment to accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and legal integrity.\nSuch a comprehensive approach ensures that the translated laws are not only linguistically accurate but also culturally appropriate and legally sound. It demonstrates that the establishment of a bilingual legal system is more than a mere administrative task; it is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires the integration of knowledge and skills from diverse fields. This holistic methodology is essential for preserving the principles of justice and ensuring the law is accessible and comprehensible to all members of society, regardless of their linguistic background.\nHowever, this strong commitment to translating written statutes stands in sharp contrast to the lackluster attitude of the Government and Judiciary towards translating case law. Despite recognizing the need for legal bilingualism, the efforts to translate case law have been sporadic and uncoordinated. The establishment of the Subcommittee on the Translation of Case Precedents in 1998, which initially showed promise, eventually faded without substantial progress or a long-term strategy.\nThere is a notable lack of a comprehensive, sustainable strategy for translating case law, which is crucial for true legal bilingualism. While the translation of written statutes was seen as a necessary and achievable goal, the ongoing translation of case law appears to be viewed as an insurmountable challenge, leading to a lack of sustained effort and commitment. Furthermore, the inconsistent implementation, marked by the discontinuation of certain committees and unclear follow-through on initial plans, suggests significant inconsistencies in how legal bilingualism in case law is being handled."}, {"title": "5 Proposed solution", "content": "While adamant about its stated policy on the translation of judgments, the Judiciary never explains why providing a bilingual version of judgments under an avowed bilingual legal system is \u201cunnecessary, unrealistic, and not cost-effective.\" So let us conjecture what argument could be put forward for each of these claims.\nFirst, the argument for the \"unnecessary\" claim may run like this: Just as not every judgment is worth reporting due to a lack of jurisprudential value, so ipso facto not every judgment is worth translating. This argument is flawed for two reasons. First, even if we accept that not every judgment has jurisprudential value, it is difficult to pinpoint a particular judgment and say with certainty that it has no jurisprudential value whatsoever. In fact, there are judgments that initially seemed to lack significant jurisprudential value but later proved to be important. A good case in point is Thompson v Cremin, which was originally decided in 1941 and escaped all notice until 1952 when Heuston discovered it in the Lords Journals \"by good fortune alone.\" Therefore, just as one cannot make the \"unnecessary\" claim for reporting on that ground, one cannot make it for translating on that ground either. Moreover, if jurisprudential value is what one seeks in a judgment, the process of translating, which involves scrutinizing the original text, can increase the chances of uncovering any jurisprudential value that might not have been immediately apparent. Thus, a stronger case can be made for translation. However, focusing on jurisprudential value is simply a red herring. We must not lose sight of the key role translation plays in our bilingual legal system: ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their preferred official language, have equal access to legal decisions. This is crucial for maintaining transparency and public trust in the legal system. Failing to provide translations of court rulings with significant social impacts has led to severe criticism of the Judiciary for rendering Hong Kong's legal system inadequately transparent. The general public has become increasingly aware that to uphold open justice in a bilingual legal system, timely translation is essential."}, {"title": "6 Development of HK Bilingual CFA Judgment Corpus", "content": "However powerful an automated translation engine, it is incapable of producing good translations without good training data. The training data for an automated translation engine comprise the initial training dataset, which forms the foundational knowledge base, and the post-edited translations, which are integrated into the database as augmented training data. This iterative refinement or feedback loop training process involves continually updating the model with improved translations, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the translation engine. Our database contains three levels of training data:\n1. Initial Training Data / Baseline Training Data:\nExisting judgments translated by court translators.\n2. Post-Edited Data / Augmented Training Data:\nThese are revised translations of existing judgments.\n3. Refined Training Data:\nThese are iterative refinements of revised judgments through incremental learning.\nAs the quality of training data has a direct bearing on the quality of output translations, evaluation plays a crucial role in producing ever-improving training data which will, in turn, produce ever-improving translations. For this purpose, we have developed a translation evaluation metric specifically for Hong Kong judicial judgments, named the ACS score. We have conducted human evaluations of the TAP system's effectiveness. This metric includes three dimensions: Accuracy in Legal Meaning, Coherence and Cohesion in Textual Structure, Style Appropriateness.\nWe have conducted a comprehensive analysis, providing clear insights into how different agents within the TAP system interact and communicate, and how they contribute to the overall system performance. This analysis aids subsequent research in making targeted improvements and innovations in this field, offering new perspectives for future studies."}, {"title": "7 The CFA Judgement Corpus 97-22", "content": "This study collected 344 Chinese judgments and their English versions from the Hong Kong court website between 1997 and 2022, constructing a corpus named CFA Judgement Corpus 97-22, which has been open-sourced on Hugging Face:\nThis figure clearly reflects the yearly trends in the number of judgments and character counts. Since 2000, both the number of judgments and character counts have significantly increased, peaking between 2006 and 2013. This trend indicates a growing number of judgments issued by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal over time, correlating with increased case complexity and legal demands.\nIdeally, these translations should be examined, evaluated, and revised before being incorporated into the bilingual corpus as training data. Despite their high standard, they were not without issues, primarily because they were done without a coherent framework and clear guidelines. There is no mechanism for standardizing the translation of frequently used terms and expressions in judgments. For example, the basic term \"judgment\" was given two different translations as \u201c\u5224\u6848\u66f8\u201d and \u201c\u5224\u8a5e\u201d instead of the official translation \u201c\u5224\u6c7a\u66f8\u201d in the Chinese translation of FACC1/2021 after two decades of experience translating judgments. Such inconsistency is only the tip of the iceberg, highlighting the need for considerable revision of existing translations before they can serve as reliable training data. However, we could not delay our project until all existing translations had been examined and revised; otherwise, it would never have commenced. As a result, we had to include existing translations in our corpus as initial training data."}, {"title": "7.1 Judgment document collection", "content": ""}, {"title": "7.2 Pre-processing", "content": "In this section, we will describe the preprocessing process that constitutes the CFA Judgement Corpus 97-22.

This results in paragraph-level English-Traditional Chinese parallel corpora (as shown in Figure 3) stored in Json format (as shown in Figure 4).\nTo achieve paragraph segmentation and text alignment, we currently use Python combined with regular expressions for paragraph division and manual proofreading, including the removal of empty lines, spaces, and tab characters. The choice of regular expressions is due to their relative simplicity and quick application to small-scale corpus processing. However, to more efficiently handle large-scale corpora and improve the accuracy of segmentation and alignment, we plan to introduce machine learning-based sentence segmentation models in the future.

Annotator: Responsible for marking errors in the Translator's translation according to the multi-level translation evaluation annotation standard (Proofread Codes, see Appendix Table 1). The errors to be annotated include but are not limited to the following types: (1) Accuracy errors: Incorrect word choice, failure to preserve information structure, meaning alteration, mistranslation, different meaning, unclear meaning, omissions, over-translation, overly literal translation, and insufficient translation; (2) Grammatical errors: Misuse of article, determiner, modal verb, numeral, preposition, and even punctuation; wrong part of speech, misspelling or mistaken character, ill-formed structure, subject-verb disagreement, tense error, and wrong word order; (3) Usage and style errors: Wrong collocation, inappropriate meaning, incorrect connective, inconsistent usage, unnatural expression, reference problems, redundancy, inappropriate style, and problematic transition. The Annotator's role is to provide detailed error annotations and modification suggestions to the Proofreader.\n3. Proofreader: Responsible for correcting and revising the initial translation from the Translator according to the Annotator's error annotations, conducting the final review, and finalizing the translation.\nThrough the collaborative work of the three agents in these roles, TAP seeks to maximize the accuracy, completeness, and professionalism of judgment translation up to a quality level to meet the rigorous"}, {"title": "4.2 Core Strategies of Agent Collaboration", "content": "Agent capability acquisition is a key process in LLM-MAS that enables agents to learn and evolve incrementally in a dynamic manner.

The first choice can only be used as an MT system, while the latter three are also the available LLM choices for the Annotator and Proofreader. We will continue to integrate more upcoming LLMs into this system as available choices. In addition, a user also needs to decide the translation direction by selecting the source and target language, for which the default choice is from English to Traditional Chinese, and choose the terminology database, for which the default choice is the Combined DoJ Glossaries of Legal Terms (but another choice is provided for users to import their own), in addition to the translation and proofreading memory database."}, {"title": "4.3.2 Execution", "content": "The process of TAP MAS execution subsumes three distinct sub-stages according to the roles of the three agents, namely, translation, error annotation, and proofreading, as presented in Figure 6.

Note that using prompts has been of the most vital importance in almost all applications of LLMs. Recent studies demonstrate that an ideal prompt can significantly boost the model performance and unlock surprising model capabilities [70, 71].\nDesigning effective prompts to guide TAP agents in understanding their roles, task requirements, and specific operational steps is crucial in improving the efficiency and output quality of the entire system. As illustrated in Figure 7, the prompts for different TAP agents comprise both role prompts and task prompts. To further optimize TAP's performance, the two agents, Translator and Proofreader, also incorporate example prompts (few-shot; underlined in Figure 7).

More technical details of this process are as follows in three phases. In the first phase, the translation process begins by dividing a document-level judgment input into multiple paragraphs, each of which then undergoes preliminary translation by the Translator agent. This agent uses GPT-3.5 Turbo as its agent LLM with a few-shot prompting strategy to feed it a certain amount of translation memory for tuning purposes.

As a whole, the proposed independent error annotation module appears to be effective in enhancing the overall performance of translating legal judgments. Notably, the Annotator is more effective for lower configurations (e.g., zero-shot T & P), as shown by an improvement of XCOMET-XL scores by 10.88% from MAS 2 to 4, but marginally effective for higher configurations with 5-shot T & P."}, {"title": "(4) Effect of Translation Memory", "content": "In the five pairs of contrastive configurations (namely MAS 1-5 vs 6-10) to examine the difference of not using vs using translation memory, only one (namely MAS 4 vs 9) shows a negligible negative effect of adding translation memory via 5-shot example prompt, and all the others show a positive improvement in the overall translation performance."}, {"title": "(5) Effect of Proofreading Memory", "content": "In the four pairs of contrastive configurations (namely MAS 2 vs 3, 4 vs 5, 7 vs 8, and 9 vs 10) to examine the effectiveness of not using vs using proofreading memory (i.e., zero- vs 5-shot P), as a whole they confirm an overall improvement of the system performance by 5-shot P. However, the two evaluation metrics show some inconsistency in scoring for this improvement, e.g., MAS 10 underperforms the baseline MAS 6 in terms of their wmt22-unite-da scores, despite a negligible difference between them. However, this tiny gap of scoring invites us to rethink about the possible limit of automated metrics in reflecting the quality of translated legal judgments, given the lack of semantic understanding in such metrics to handle the complexity of legal language, its accuracy in terms of semantics and contextual applicability, and also the prominence of legal terminology. Legal judgments contain many specialized terms and expressions that automated metrics usually treat as normal words and do not recognize their special values in translation. Moreover, automated metrics are typically paired with the multidimensional quality metrics (MQM) framework [80] for translation evaluation, but it remains a problem if this framework has incorporated all necessary dimensions for assessing the quality of Hong Kong legal judgment translation, including accuracy in legal meaning, appropriateness in style, coherence and cohesion in discourse structure, to name but a few.

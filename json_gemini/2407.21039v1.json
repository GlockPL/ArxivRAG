{"title": "Mapping Patient Trajectories: Understanding and Visualizing Sepsis Prognostic Pathways from Patients Clinical Narratives", "authors": ["Sudeshna Jana", "Tirthankar Dasgupta", "Lipika Dey"], "abstract": "In recent years, healthcare professionals are increasingly emphasizing on personalized and evidence-based patient care through the exploration of prognostic pathways. To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement. This empowers healthcare providers to implement more personalized and effective healthcare strategies for individual patients.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In healthcare, there is an increasing trend to shift towards from doctor-centered treatment to patient-centered treatment approaches, where the intent is to design individualized care for patients based on their health conditions, demography, personal history, and preferences (Johnson et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Esfahani et al., 2020). This approach promises better outcomes for all since any two patients are not exactly similar. Even a simple disease can be heterogeneous in its clinical presentation in terms of multi-morbidity, severity, as well as response to treatments (Alexander et al., 2021; Battaglia et al., 2020). By implementing personalized care plans, healthcare costs can be reduced by eliminating unnecessary medical examinations and tailoring treatment plans accordingly.\nPrognostic pathways, derived from the experiences of past patients, play a major role in clinical decision-making in general, and more specifically in enabling personalized treatments. These pathways outline the expected disease progression, stages, influential factors of a particular disease, and potential outcomes for a specific patient or group of patients. It provides valuable guidance and support to healthcare professionals to assess a newly arrived patient's risk of developing complications, how the disease is expected to progress, and the likelihood of certain outcomes. Based on the individual patient's assessed risk, medical practitioners can tailor their treatment approach to meet the patient's unique needs. For instance, for a patient with high risk, medical practitioners may choose a more aggressive treatment approach or monitor the patient more closely. Moreover, by gaining insights into the expected disease trajectory, healthcare professionals can allocate critical healthcare resources such as intensive care units (ICUs), operating rooms (OTs), mechanical ventilators, etc. more efficiently. These prognostic pathways empower healthcare professionals to deliver precision-based, patient-centered care, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of healthcare services.\nIn recent years, clinical researchers have increasingly employed diverse disease progression models to analyze and delineate the trajectory of disease development based on longitudinal health records of patients.

In previous works (Jana et al., 2022b,a), authors utilized several transformer-based representations such as BERT, ClinicalBioBERT, and BlueBERT embeddings of these notes in various predictive models. While these embeddings effectively captured linguistic nuances like distinguishing between severe and mild pain, they sometimes struggled to discern similarities or differences between two notes based solely on medical terms. Therefore, before getting into the stratification work, where note similarity is crucial, we introduced an additional processing layer. Each clinical note underwent initial processing through biomedical dictionaries to standardize terms.

Some healthcare professionals document solely the symptoms present on a given day, while others meticulously record the absence of common symptoms, adverse reactions, the psychological state of patients, appetite changes, and more. The utilization of non-standard terminology and abbreviations is also frequently observed in these notes. To address this diversity, we have introduced an additional processing layer, wherein each clinical note undergoes initial processing through the Biomedical dictionaries to derive a more structured representation of the patients' health conditions, as illustrated in Figure 2. The details of the processing pipeline using the biomedical dictionaries are presented below."}, {"title": "2.1.1 Entity Extraction:", "content": "We employed two BioNER tools, ScispaCy (Neumann et al., 2019) and Metamap (Aronson, 2006), for the extraction of patients' health conditions from clinical notes.

For instance, a single medical condition like \"Hemorrhage", "Bleeding": "Blood loss\u201d or \u201coozing of blood\" by different healthcare professionals. To address this variability, we have standardized all extracted entities using the UMLS Metathesaurus (Schuyler et al., 1993), which includes a comprehensive list of such scenarios and assigns a \"Concept Unique Identifier (CUI)\u201d to each. However, we observed that certain entities did not yield an exact match with any UMLS concept. To resolve this, an approximate string-matching algorithm was employed, identifying the closest UMLS concept based on the Levenshtein distance measure (Yujian and Bo, 2007) for entities without an exact match. In cases where entities couldn't be mapped to any UMLS concept, unique identifiers were created to ensure no health condition was overlooked. To prevent any ambiguity, we explicitly refer to these unique identifiers as CUIs.\nNow, every clinical note can be effectively represented by the presence or absence of CUIs. Let the comprehensive list or vocabulary of CUIs, encompassing descriptions of diseases and symptoms relevant to a specific study, be denoted as V. Consequently, a patient's condition at a particular point in time can also be expressed in terms of these CUIs.\""}, {"title": "2.1.4 Handling Missing Data:", "content": "In our analysis of EHR, we identified a common challenge related to the absence of documented medical records on certain hospital days, leading"}, {"title": "2.1.5 Vector Representation:", "content": "Afterward, we have segmented the patient's hospitalization duration into distinct stages.

Therefore, before doing the risk assessment, we aim to categorize patients into subgroups based on their health conditions at the initial stage. This helps in understanding for which comorbidities patients will be in high-risk or low-risk in the future. In our study, we have used the k-means clustering algorithm (Ja, 1979), utilizing the Euclidean distance as the metric to assess similarities among patients. For a given value of k, a set of k cluster centers is randomly selected, and each data point is assigned to the cluster by iteratively minimizing the within-cluster distance. To determine the optimal value of k, we have utilized the silhouette coefficient (Kodinariya et al., 2013). This coefficient measures how similar each point is to others within the same cluster compared to points in other clusters. The average silhouette coefficient, computed across all points, offers a metric for assessing the cohesiveness of each cluster as well as their separation or distinctiveness from one another.\nTo generate human-interpretable explanations for the clusters, we have proposed leveraging Shapley values (Merrick and Taly, 2020), which quantify the contribution of each feature for each individual towards the final outcome while preserving the sum of all contributions. Our objective was to provide explanations in terms of diseases or symptoms, encompassing the predominant symptoms within a cluster and highlighting the differentiating aspects between clusters. We utilized a CUI-based representation for this purpose.

To extract prognostic pathways, our initial step involves the identification and categorization of sepsis severity for each patient in each stage according to the Sepsis-3 definition (Singer et al., 2016). The Sepsis-3 criteria, introduced by the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) in 2016, provides a clinical framework for assessing sepsis severity and classifying patients into four distinct states: Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Sepsis, Severe Sepsis, and Septic Shock.\nFor the computation of sepsis severity at each stage, structured features such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell (WBC) count were systematically extracted from the 'CHARTEVENTS.csv' file within the MIMIC database. Additionally, complementary information related to infection, organ dysfunction, hypotension, intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation, and other relevant features is derived from our previously collected data obtained from clinical notes. This integration of structured and unstructured data enhances the comprehensiveness of our approach and provides a more nuanced understanding of sepsis severity across different stages. To quantitatively represent the severity of each sepsis state, we have assigned a severity score to each: SIRS: 1, Sepsis: 2, Severe Sepsis: 3, and Septic Shock: 4. This scoring system enhances the interpretability of our findings and facilitating a clearer communication of the severity levels associated with each sepsis state."}, {"title": "3 Results and Discussions", "content": "In summary, the development of practice-based prognostic pathways offers a structured approach\nWhen a patient transitions from one stage to the next, we have defined the potential outcomes or states based on the progression of sepsis severity as follows:\n\u2022 Discharge: when the patient is discharged in the next stage.\n\u2022 Improve: when the severity score decreases compared to the previous stage, indicating a positive response.\n\u2022 Persistent: if the severity score remains unchanged from the previous stage.\n\u2022 Deteriorate: when the severity score increases compared to the previous stage, signifying a worsening condition.\n\u2022 Decease: if the patient is expired during the next stage.\n\u2022 Unknown: if the sepsis state is unknown in the next stage, due to missing information in the database.\nAfterward, we have analyzed the outcomes or states during the transition for each stage across different patient subgroups. In the progression networks of sepsis severity for each patient subgroup, each stage, except final stage consists five nodes represent distinct states such as discharge, improvement, persistent, deterioration and decease. In the final stage, only two nodes, discharge and decease, remain. To simplify our analysis, we excluded the \u2018Unknown' state. The edges, denoted as $e_{s_i s_j}$, represent the probability of transitioning to state $s_j$ in the next stage based on the state of preceding stage $s_i$, expressed as $e_{s_i s_j}$ = P($X_t$ = $s_j$|$X_{t-1}$ = $s_i$).

Notably, in subgroups A6 and A8, 10% and 13% of patients, respectively, experienced unfortunate outcomes and deceased during the second stage. However, for the majority of patients in each group, the severity of sepsis remained consistent. Similarly, we have analyzed the penitential outcomes or states for each subgroup during the transitions between other stages also. We have noticed that, patients across subgroups A5, A2, and A8, whose sepsis severity improved in Stage 2, exhibited the highest discharge rates at 54%, 49% and 48%, respectively, indicating a complete recovery in Stage 3. In contrast, patients in Subgroup A1, with improved sepsis severity in Stage 2, exhibited the lowest discharge rate at 11%, with a majority experiencing unchanged sepsis severity. Furthermore, we observed that 40% of patients in subgroup A7 experienced worsening sepsis severity in Stage 2 and unfortunately deceased in Stage 3.

In our study, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning-based representations in capturing the complexity of clinical notes, thereby providing valuable insights into patient cohorts. Additionally, we have generated comprehensive trajectories for each cohort using these representations. Furthermore, we are exploring the utility of large language models, such as MedLM, for extracting information from clinical notes. In our future work, we also plan to integrate treatment information, such as medications or procedures, into these prognostic pathways. This integration will enable a deeper understanding of complete clinical pathways, allowing us to identify the most effective treatment strategies and assess any potential adverse effects of drugs that may lead to prolonged hospitalization."}]}

This paper presents a machine learning\nmodel for the fault detection and classification of induction\nmotor faults by using three phase voltages and currents as\ninputs. The aim of this work is to protect vital electrical\ncomponents and to prevent abnormal event progression\nthrough early detection and diagnosis. This work presents a\nfast forward artificial neural network model to detect some of\nthe commonly occurring electrical faults like overvoltage,\nunder voltage, single phasing, unbalanced voltage, overload,\nground fault. A separate model free monitoring system\nwherein the motor itself acts like a sensor is presented and the\nonly monitored signals are the input given to the motor. Limits\nfor current and voltage values are set for the faulty and\nhealthy conditions, which is done by a classifier. Real time data\nfrom a 0.33 HP induction motor is used to train and test the\nneural network. The model so developed analyses the voltage\nand current values given at a particular instant and classifies\nthe data into no fault or the specific fault. The model is then\ninterfaced with a real motor to accurately detect and classify\nthe faults so that further necessary action can be taken.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Induction motors are the most extensively used electrical\nmotors because of their simple construction, ruggedness and\nlow cost. More than 90% of the industries use induction\nmotors, mostly as electrical drives since they can be\ndesigned for a wide range of power ratings. In spite of their\nflexibility and robustness, they are subjected to many\ncatastrophic failures. Identifying these faults at an early\nstage and attending to them is very important as otherwise\nthey lead to huge production and financial losses. Pre- fault\ndetection and isolation of the healthy parts also prevents\nfault progression and failure of other more vital\ncomponents. Industries use a large number of motors and\nhence, their manual maintenance is tedious and unreliable.\nTherefore, many attempts have been made towards\nautomatic maintenance. Earlier, conditional monitoring of\nelectrical machines was employed and\nthe\nelectromechanical relays were put to use to achieve this. But\nthese relays are slow in operation and also lead to huge\npower losses due to mechanical parts involved [6]. Hence,\nthey cannot be used in critical applications requiring small\nresponse times. Electromechanical relays were later\nreplaced by solid state relays as they consume very less\npower and are comparatively fast. With the advent of\nmicroprocessors, attempts were made for conditional\nmonitoring of machines by using pre- written programmes\ndownloaded onto the microprocessor chips.\nThe above mentioned techniques, however could not\nguarantee maximum safety and reliability as they cannot\naddress catastrophic failures. Computer revolution with the\ndawn of machine learning drew the attention of scientists\nand they began to think of ways through which these\ntechniques could be used to monitor and safeguard\nmachines. Machine learning models take the place of human\nto intelligently monitor and maintain the specified system\ntasks [4]. Artificial neural networks are very handy in this\nregard as they can handle huge amount of data, have small\nresponse time and can effectively handle non- linearity\n(which most of the time is the inherent characteristic of\nelectromechanical systems) [10].\nThe aim of this work is to prevent fault progression and\nprotect vital components of the power system by early\ndetection of electrical faults of three phase induction motors\nusing artificial neural network. We have addressed seven\nclasses of electrical faults of induction motors; overload,"}, {"title": "II. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH.", "content": "The ANN comes under machine learning approaches.\nAny machine learning problem is solved through the\nfollowing steps.\n1. Defining objectives: The first step towards\n addressing any machine learning problem is to\n define the goals. The problem might be to find a\n numerical output value (linear regression), to\n separate into classes (classification) or clustering.\n The type of machine learning approach that needs\n to be used is decided by studying the problem and\n extracting the objectives out of it.\n2. Data acquisition: The data required to train the\n neural network is obtained in real time. The type\n and amount of data required depends on the\n application.\n3. Separating train and test data: The collected data is\n then divided into train and test data to train the\n neural network model and then test its working and\n calculate its accuracy [12].\n4. Analysing the findings: The obtained results are\n then analysed to check for any errors and also to\n identify scope for improvement, if any.\n5. Interfacing with real system: Once the proper\n working of the trained model is confirmed, it is\n interfaced with a real system and is then used in\n real time applications.\nThe Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is designed to mimic\nhuman brain to think for itself and take action without being\nexplicitly programmed. Just like a human brain, the ANN\nmodel consists of artificial neurons or nodes as the basic\nbuilding blocks. The nodes are arranged in layers: input\nlayer, output layer and one or more hidden layers. The\nhidden layer is used to increase the accuracy of\nclassification. The working of the algorithm can be\nexplained from the below steps.\n1) The algorithm assigns weights or priorities to each\n of the input variable.\n2) It then multiplies the weight with the input\n variable, x\u2081 and adds bias to it. The same thing is\ndone to each of the node and the summation of\nthese values is transmitted to the next layer.\nThe learning proceeds as data moves through each\nlayer.\n3) The data at the end of output node is then\ncompared with a set threshold value and if the\ncalculated value exceeds the threshold, the input\nvector is classified to the intended class or else is\npassed over to check for other classes.\nThe block diagram of the working of a feed\nforward back loop neural network algorithm is as\nshown in fig.1.\n4) The calculated class is compared with the actual\n output and any error is corrected by varying the\n number of layers and the number of neurons.\n5) The process is continued till an accurate fit is\n obtained and the model is hence, trained. The\n equation of the algorithm is,\n$\\Sigma X_i+ Bias \\geq Threshold$\nIn this work, three phase voltages and currents of a three\nphase 1/3 HP, 208 V induction motor is used as the input.\nData is collected in real time for each of the classes and is\nused to train and test the neural network. MATLAB is the\nsoftware used whose neural network toolboxes train and\ntests the data."}, {"title": "III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "In this work, the artificial neural network model is created\nand trained by using three phase voltages and currents as the\ninput. The model is trained for each of the seven electrical\nfaults using approximately 800 value sets of three phase\nvoltages and currents. Feed forward backloop algorithm is used and the trained\nmodel is as shown in fig. 2\nThe weight (priority) assigned to each input can be seen\nfrom fig 2 and also the mathematical function $\\Sigma X_iW_i$+Bias\noperating can be visualised. After each summation, a\nsigmoid function is generated which transmits the current\nvalue to the next layer. And the regression plot showing the\naccuracy of training is as shown in fig 3.\nFrom fig 3, it can be observed that the trained model fits\naccurately with the ideal. Hence, the training of the network\nis satisfactory. The trained neural network was then tested\nwith test data. The ANN model classified each of the test\ndata into their respective classes."}, {"title": "IV. INTERFACING WITH REAL MOTOR\nSYSTEM", "content": "To interface the developed ANN model with the motor\nsystem, the data need to be collected continuously in real\ntime from current and voltage sensors. The obtained values\nare transmitted to Wi-Fi router by using a reliable Wi-Fi\nconnection. This data is then transferred and collected on a\ncloud platform (any of the many available) by using an\nEthernet cable between the router and storage system. From\nthe cloud, the data is continuously transmitted onto the\nMATLAB workspace. When a fault occurs, the trained\nANN model detects the fault immediately and notifies the\ncontrol system to take action."}, {"title": "V. SIMILAR MACHINE LEARNING BASED\nTECHNIQUES.", "content": "Of late, many other methodologies like Support vector\nmachines (SVM), fuzzy logic, MCSA are being considered\nfor applications involving predictive maintenance of\nelectrical equipment. However, they involve lot of\nmathematics, are parameter based and hence, are error prone\nwhen used for large and complex systems. High\nmathematical dependency of these techniques also makes\nthem not so efficient for electromechanical systems due to\ntheir inability to handle non- linearity [13]. ANN on the\nother hand is non-parametric, does not require complex\nmathematics and can be realised using simple tools and\nhence, is a very potent methodology for fault detection and\nmaintenance [9]."}, {"title": "VI. FUTURE SCOPE", "content": "Predictive maintenance of electrical equipment, including\ninduction motors using MACHINE LEARNING approaches\nis still in proposal stage in many developing countries\nincluding India. ANN due to its ability to learn from\nprevious experiences can effectively address catastrophic\nfailures and is perfect to handle non- linearity in data. The\nproposed ANN model is satisfactorily interfaced with real\nsystems and is proven to be reliable. Hence it can serve as\nthe most efficient and economical predictive maintenance\ntool in future. The proposed model can also be extended for\nD.C and synchronous motors."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "This work depicts the potential of machine learning tool\n(ANN) in detecting the electrical faults of a three phase\ninduction motor. The data collected in real time from a 1/3\nHP, 208 V three phase induction motor was used to train\nand test the neural network. The developed neural network\nclassifies all the test data into their respective classes with\nalmost 100% accuracy.\nThe accuracy of the trained model is reflected by the results\nobtained using the test data and also from the regression plot\nshown in figure 3. In case there are errors in classification,\nthe accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of\nhidden layers and by choosing optimum number of neurons.\nThe proposed model gives accurate results and hence,\nprevents event progression during the occurrence of faults\nand protects vital electrical equipment."}]}

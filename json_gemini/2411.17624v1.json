{"title": "Machine Learning and Multi-source Remote Sensing in Forest Carbon Stock Estimation: A Review", "authors": ["Autumn Nguyen", "Sulagna Saha"], "abstract": "Quantifying forest carbon is crucial for informing decisions and policies that will protect the planet. Machine learning (ML) and remote sensing (RS) techniques have been used to do this task more effectively, yet there lacks a systematic review on the most recent ML methods and RS combinations, especially with the consideration of forest characteristics. This study systematically analyzed 25 papers meeting strict inclusion criteria from over 80 related studies, identifying 28 ML methods and key combinations of RS data. Random Forest had the most frequently appearance (88% of studies), while Extreme Gradient Boosting showed superior performance in 75% of the studies in which it was compared with other methods. Sentinel-1 emerged as the most utilized remote sensing source, with multi-sensor approaches (e.g., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and LiDAR) proving especially effective. Our findings provide grounds for recommending best practices in integrating machine learning and remote sensing for accurate and scalable forest carbon stock estimation.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": ""}, {"title": "Why forests carbon stock estimation?", "content": "Forests capture carbon, which helps regulate climate. The main driver of the increasing global deforestation is because forests are mostly valued in terms of their economical value, like how much timber or area of land they can provide, rather than on how much they help regulate climate. To quantify the value of forests in fighting climate change consequences, we need to quantify forests' carbon stock."}, {"title": "How does forest carbon get measured?", "content": "The best way to measure the amount of carbon sequestered in a forest is to do so with direct field measurements (Cunningham and Montgomery 2011). People go into the forest to count the trees, measure the trees' DBH, measure canopy height, identify species, etc. Those data would be put into forestry allometric equations to calculate the forests' aboveground biomass (AGB). Belowground biomass (BGB) and soil organic carbon are other key components of forests' total biomass, but it cannot be quantified well from remote sensing data. \u201cDue to the difficulty of collecting field survey data of belowground biomass, the majority of previous biomass studies have focused on AGB.\u201d (Lu et al. 2016). Most of the papers reviewed in this paper were also estimations of AGB.\n\nThe role of forests in countering the climate crisis is not only in sequestering and storing carbon. The biodiversity that it protects, the soil that it keeps from eroding, the rainwater that it keeps from becoming flood, the pollutants that it removes from the atmosphere... are just a few of the important gifts that forests give to the Earth."}, {"title": "Why remote sensing?", "content": ""}, {"title": "Because carbon stock estimation no longer feasible with traditional inventory", "content": "It requires too much personnel and equipment and takes too much time for field measurements to be feasible to measure carbon stocks of large forest areas. Moreover, it is still impossible to go into some deep forest areas to take measurements, at least if we don't want to cause disturbances in nature."}, {"title": "What can remote sensing offer", "content": "By their ability to fly over large areas with minimal disturbance, remote sensing technologies can capture information about large-scale forests, such as tree density, vegetation cover, and 3D structures, and these data are closely related to AGB. According to (Cunningham and Montgomery 2011), \"remote sensing is a general term describing the technology and application for observing the earth. Glamorous technologies include satellite imaging, but remote sensing also includes traditional aerial photography. Remote sensing technology is not only used to make accurate maps and measurements of forests, but more sophisticated sensors utilizing LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) can be used to quantify the biomass content of a forest.\""}, {"title": "Perks and key issues of remote sensing-based models", "content": "(Lu et al. 2016) said that previous research had shown that remote sensing-based models provide more accurate biomass estimation than other models (e.g. process-based ecosystem models, GIS-based empirical models...). However, the assumption that must be made when using remote sensing-based methods was that forest stand information captured by sensors was highly correlated with aboveground biomass (Lu et al. 2012). Therefore, we needed to ensure a sufficient number of available sample plots, suitable metrics selected for modeling, suitable algorithms used to establish the models, and suitable methods used to conduct uncertainty analysis of the estimates (Lu et al. 2012)."}, {"title": "Why multi-source remote sensing?", "content": "In short, combining multiple sources remote sensing is promising because it allows the capabilities of one source to compensate for the limitations of the other sources. Examples of a few major categories are collected from studies like (Huang et al. 2022) and summarized in Table 1."}, {"title": "Why Machine Learning (ML)?", "content": "ML are algorithms that can learn from the carbon stock measurements we have for some forest areas to make predictions of what those may be in other forest areas. They can also help with data imputation\u2014which means estimating missing values based on patterns in the data and making the dataset complete for further analysis. An example (Rolnick et al. 2022) gave was \"The height of trees can be estimated fairly accurately with LiDAR devices mounted on UAVs, but this technology is not scalable and many areas are closed to UAVs. To address this challenge, ML can be used to predict LiDAR's outcome from satellite imagery. From there, the learned estimator can perform predictions at scale. Despite progress in this area, there is still significant room for improvement.\""}, {"title": "Related studies", "content": "(Sun and Liu 2020) did a comprehensive review on the fundamental types of forest carbon estimation: vegetation carbon storage, soil carbon storage, and litter carbon storage. For vegetation carbon storage, Sun found that inventory-based methods were used most often, followed by satellite-based and then process-based methods. Within satellite-based methods, optical remote sensors were used 58 times, while radar sensors were only used once, and LiDAR used 7 times. Our results (4) found radar and LiDAR used much more often than this finding. In addition, our study also reviewed studies globally and reviewed the studies that used ML, while (Sun and Liu 2020) only reviewed the studies in China, and they also did not review the machine learning methods used.\n\n(Rolnick et al. 2022) was a comprehensive big-picture review of ML in climate change-related research and industry efforts. They mentioned the opportunity for ML to help in forest carbon stock estimation, but they had very few references to research studies many references were either very dated or were blog posts of companies in industry. We focused more on recent academic research in this review paper.\n\n(Hamedianfar et al. 2022) reviewed all deep learning methods used in creating forest inventory. In reviewing the studies related to continuous forest variable estimation, they collected information like the deep learning methods, the ML task (e.g. regression, segmentation, classification, etc.), the data (e.g. LiDAR, Landsat, etc.), the variable (e.g. AGB, canopy height, species, etc.), the sample size (i.e. how many plots), etc. In reviewing the studies related to segmentation and classification, they also collected information like the optimizer, the learning rate, the labeled data, etc. We personally thought this was a very technical paper that would be hard for people without advanced deep learning expertise to understand; thus, one of our aims for our paper is to make the information more accessible to the general audience. In addition, (Hamedianfar et al. 2022) did not cover non-deep learning techniques, which have been used very frequently in forest carbon estimation; and many studies they reviewed stopped at creating forest inventory, without doing any carbon stock estimation using those inventory information.\n\nThe most similar review with ours that we could find was (Matiza et al. 2023) on ML and remote sensing approaches in estimating carbon storage in natural forests. They found out that 36% of the studies used more than one type of dataset;"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "Literature search terms", "content": "The 25 papers in that we drew quantitative results from were selected from the first 15 results of these search terms: \u201c(estimation OR estimating OR \"machine learning\") (multisource OR multi-source) forest carbon biomass map\", and the first 20 results of these search terms \"(estimation OR estimating OR \"machine learning\") (multisensor OR multi-sensor) forest carbon biomass map\". The aim of this search term was to find papers that surely had a Machine Learning component, used a combination of different sources of remote sensing data, and for the purpose of mapping carbon stick or biomass of forests. The reasons for the specific words in the search term are:\n\n\u2022 Through our pilot analysis, we noticed that a lot of studies using Machine Learning to estimate forest carbon had words in the family of \"estimation\u201d in the title, while \"Machine Learning\" might not be in the title or even the abstract because the authors just directly used the name of the ML methods.\n\n\u2022 Studies that use a combination of active and passive remote sensors usually mentioned \u201cmulti-source\u201d or \u201cmulti-sensor\" explicitly in their title or abstract. \u201cMulti-source\u201d means getting data from multiple different sources, which can be different things than remote sensors (for example, from traditional inventory sources), while \u201cmulti-sensor\" only refers to using multiple remote sensors. However, since most of the papers we reviewed also used data from multiple remote sensors, we chose to focus on the multi-remote sensing part of multi-source. Having \"multi-sensor\" instead of \"multi-source\u201d in the search term also resulted in a bit more geographical diversity in the sources and study areas of the resulting papers.\n\n\u2022 All of the words \"forest\", \"carbon\u201d \u201cbiomass\u201d, and \u201cmap\u201d should have frequent presence in the title or abstract to ensure the relevance of the studies to our review topic."}, {"title": "Literature querying method", "content": "We retrieved the papers from this search into a database using the public API from (Ankit 2021), specifically the google_scholar_internal function."}, {"title": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "The 25 papers were included because only them satisfied five of our inclusion criteria: (1) full paper accessible to us (so most are open access articles, since we are college students with almost no subscriptions to any journals), (2) used ML in the study, (3) used multiple sources of remote sensing data, (4) had the end goal being estimation forest carbon, whether it was AGB or BGB or soil carbon, and (5) was written in the recent 10 years (2014-2024)."}, {"title": "Data collection", "content": "From the included 25 papers, the following data was collected for the quantitative database:\n\n\u2022 All the remote sensing sources that the study took data from.\n\n\u2022 All the ML methods used in the study.\n\n\u2022 If the study used multiple ML methods for comparison of performance on the same task, or for each method to be used on a different task.\n\n\u2022 If the study used multiple ML methods for comparison, which method(s) were found to have the best performance? Since there are many different ways to define \"best\", we just included the methods that were explicitly mentioned in the abstract or conclusion with a keyword \"best\", or \"highest\" for metrics like $R^2$ or accuracy, or \"lowest\u201d for metrics like RMSE or uncertainty.\n\n\u2022 Any limitations or future steps thoroughly explained.\n\n\u2022 The ultimate task, such as AGB map, BGB map, general biomass map, multi-scale biomass maps, uncertainty estimation, etc.\n\n\u2022 The location(s) of the studied forests.\n\n\u2022 The types or characteristics or dominant species of the forests.\n\nThe forest type categories we used in our review are not at all mutually exclusive or deterministic they are meant to facilitate readers in identifying the papers that work on forests of similar types to their interest.\n\nSince the words people used to describe their forests varied widely between papers, and there are no world-wide standardized terminologies for either forest types or biomes, we did our best to identify the common terms used across papers, and refer to a few sources ((Xu et al. 2022), (ArcGIS 2024)) to determine the forest types of the papers that did not use exactly those common terms (so we related their terms to the common terms), and of the papers that did not have any terms about the type of their forest (for those, we used the geographical latitude and longitude of the area to determine the type based on the external sources cited above).\n\n\u2022 The scale of the study: region, country, or global."}, {"title": "Data analysis", "content": "Python libraries, namely Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy, were used to manipulate and visualize data."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Table 2 was a summary of the data sources and ML methods used in the studies from which quantitative results were drawn from.

It was usually used as the model for the end task-AGB estimation, and sometimes as the model for other intermediate tasks in the data processing pipeline.\n\nSince many of those ML methods are closely related to each other, we grouped them in Figure 2 to see the trend in a bigger picture. Individual members of the groups are specified in the appendix. Random Forests are still the most commonly used methods, but the distribution is more smooth. Most methods found to have the best performance in Figure 3 also fall into the three most frequently used groups: Random Forest (RF, QRF, RRF), Gradient Boosting (XGB, LGBM, CatBoost), and Neural Network (CNN, BayesResNN)."}, {"title": "Feature selection", "content": ""}, {"title": "General", "content": "Feature selection was found to be a critical factor influencing the models' performances in many studies. Feature selection means selectively choosing which variables, from all the data available, to use as inputs to the estimation models. (Li et al. 2019) demonstrated how variable selection had significantly influenced the performance of all of their models; their XGBoost model was the one benefiting the most from optimal variable selection. (Huang et al. 2022) selected only 7 variables from over 30 initial numerical parameters to use in all of their four data schemes; the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm was used to do feature selection, which they concluded to have been able to \"effectively remove the non-significant variables\u201d. However, there were studies that did not do variable selection, like (Li et al. 2020). Their main reason was that their dataset didn't have a lot of variables, and their Sentinel variables might all be lost after multiple rounds of variable selections. Since their main goal was to compare the performance of the models between a single sensor dataset and multi-sensors combined dataset, they couldn't afford to lose all variables in their Sentinel dataset. Another reason they gave was that their ML models were robust against noise: the RF algorithm was not influenced by noisy variables; the XGB model, though not as resistant as RF, could restrain the noise predictor variables by the regularization objective; and thus their parallel ensemble was noise-resistant. Since this was somewhat contrasting with how many studies using RF and XGB did perform feature selection and noted the improved performance, it would be an interesting topic to look into the relationship between feature selection and choice of ML models.\n\nWe had similar observation with (Zhang et al. 2023) that the most commonly used variables were vegetation indices and texture measures, which are spectral features extracted from optical remote sensing images. However, which variables being most important depends heavily on the characterstics of the forests, which vary widely. Regardless, since there are usually a lot"}, {"title": "Phenological variables", "content": "Phenological characteristics are generally the seasonal patterns and timing of biological events of different forest types and different tree species. When (Zhang et al. 2023) inputed phenological variables into their model, they achieved a higher R-squared result. Although their study area had evergreen coniferous as the dominant forest type, and pine, oak, and walnut as the dominant species, an implication of their work was that incorporating data about phenological characteristics and dominant species significantly improved the accuracy of AGB estimation. Phenological characteristics were also used to help extracting the distribution information of their study subject (larch trees) in (Hong et al. 2023)."}, {"title": "Time", "content": "The close relationship between phenological data and time were a major advantage for AGB estimations. Forests' carbon flux varies over seasons, but the commonly used spectral variables from optical sensors only reflected the state of the forests at one point in time. Therefore, the AGB estimation based solely on those variables couldn't be scaled temporally (Zhang et al. 2023). With phenological variables in play, we can create what (Zhang et al. 2023) called time-consistent AGB models. In (Hong et al. 2023)'s study, their LSTM model did well in the last stage of their study pipeline, which was extrapolating biomass components at the regional scale. It is reasonable because LSTM is a type of recurrent neural networks that is specialized in working with time-series and sequential data, and time is an important indicator in the phenological data they used. When (Hong et al. 2023) compared LSTM with RF for this task, they found that the LSTM model was less prone to underestimation of biomass, and this characteristic became more obvious when the sample unit biomass was increased."}, {"title": "3D structural data", "content": "3D structural data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) or other digital elevation models (DEM) seems to be frequently used in the studies that didn't have LiDAR data, when it was used, it was usually one of the the most important predictor variables. This makes sense because the 3D structure is highly indicative of a forest's AGB. (Huang et al. 2023) had Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 as the two main remote sensors, with the addition of DEM data, and found that DEM was the most important variable. (Huang et al. 2022) also had optical sensors and radar sensor as Sentinel-2B, Sentinel-2A, Sentinel 1A, with the inclusion of DEM data."}, {"title": "Forest types, characteristics, and categories", "content": "We originally wanted to categorize the studies by forest types to review the best methods found for each type. However, we discovered a few key issues. First, the words people used to describe their forest types varied widely between papers, and there are no standardized terminologies for forest types. Second, many studies developed general methods and models for an area that spanned forests of different dominant species, weather, characteristics, and even biomes. Thus, we couldn't always infer how good or bad the methods was for each \"forest type\". Nonetheless, we have seen that the studies that had the most promising results were the ones that took into serious consideration the unique characteristics of their forest; for example, the heterogeneous canopy height and species diversity of a rainforest, or the varying elevation of an alpine forest. Our conclusion is, therefore, while it may be impossible to recommend specific methods for clear categories of forest, the recommendation can be that researchers should understand the unique characeristics of their forest to decide on which data sources and ML methods to use, and carefully select the most relevant variables to use as features."}, {"title": "Different ML algorithms may be suitable for different stages of a forest carbon mapping pipeline", "content": "(Zhang et al. 2023), in mapping AGB in alpine regions of Yunnan, used three different ML methods through their pipeline: logistic regression to extract phenological parameters from Landsat and work with MCCDC; SVM to take in in phenological parameters and classify forest dominant tree groups; and RF to take in forest dominant tree groups mapping and create AGB map for the region. (Hong et al. 2023) compared RF and MLR for creating Plot-Scale Biomass Component Estimation Model; used SVM for the extraction of Larch Distribution Information on the Basis of Vegetation Phenology Characteristics; and compared RF and LSTM for the extrapolation of Biomass Components at the Regional Scale. (Xi et al. 2023) used an optimized RF regressor to calculate early estimates of carbon storage at the canopy scale in the footprints of ICESat-2/ATLAS LiDAR data; and used a deep neural network to create regional-scale carbon storage maps from those early LiDAR estimates and Landsat data."}, {"title": "Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "This review highlights the machine learning methods and the remote sensing sources and combinations with the highest usage frequency and performance. Our recommendation for future studies on estimating forest AGB is to, in terms of remote sensing data sources, combine multiple sources of remote sensing data, at least passive optical and radar optical, like (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) or (MODIS and ALOS-PALSAR), to address coverage and saturation limitations. In addition, including data that can indicate the forest's 3D structure, like from DEM or active optical sensors, can enhance accuracy and mitigate the overestimation-underestimation problem. In terms of ML methods, Random Forest may be a good method due to its long history of reliability, but it may also be worth trying other methods that had proven success recently, such as Extreme Gradient Boosting or CNN. We also emphasize the importance of feature selection and ensuring the spatial heterogeneity of sample plots to improve model performance. Additionally, rather than just using one ML method, different ML methods can be leveraged at various stages of the data processing pipeline. Future work should also take into account the types, characteristics, and dominant species of the forest types in building estimation models."}, {"title": "Abbreviations of ML methods", "content": "\u2022 Random Forest (RF)\n\u2022 Quantile Random Forest (QRF)\n\u2022 Regularized Random Forest (RRF)\n\u2022 Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT)\n\u2022 Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB)\n\u2022 Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT)\n\u2022 Boosted Regression Tree (BRT)\n\u2022 Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)\n\u2022 Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM)\n\u2022 Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB)\n\u2022 Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)\n\u2022 Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)\n\u2022 Linear Regression (LR)\n\u2022 Multi-Linear Regression (MLR)\n\u2022 Stepwise Linear Regression (StepwiseLR)\n\u2022 Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)\n\u2022 Random Forest with Stacking Algorithm (RFStacking)\n\u2022 Cubist Regression Tree Ensemble (CubistRTEns)\n\u2022 Stacked Ensemble for RF and boosting algorithms\n\u2022 Bayesian Regularization Neural Network (BayesRegNN)"}, {"title": "Groupings of ML methods", "content": "The ML methods were grouped as follows:\n\n\u2022 'Random Forest': ['RF', 'RRF', 'QRF', 'ERT'],\n\n\u2022 'Gradient Boosting': ['GTB', 'GBM', 'GBRT', 'BRT', 'LGBM', 'SGB', 'XGB', 'CatBoost'],\n\n\u2022 'Linear Regression': ['MLR', 'LR', 'Stepwise LR', 'MARS'],\n\n\u2022 'Neural Networks': ['LSTM', 'QRNN', 'CNN', 'ANN', 'BayesRegNN', 'Keras'],\n\n\u2022 'Support Vector Machines': ['SVM', 'SVR'],\n\n\u2022 'Stacking/Ensembles': ['RFStacking', 'StackedEnsemble'],\n\n\u2022 'Cubist': ['CubistRTEns'],\n\n\u2022 'k-NN': ['kNN']"}]}

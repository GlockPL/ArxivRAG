This study examines the pandemic's impact on mental health by analyzing dream content shared on the Reddit r/Dreams community. With over 374,000 subscribers, this platform offers a rich dataset for exploring subconscious responses to the pandemic. Using statistical methods, we assess shifts in dream positivity, negativity, and neutrality from the pre-pandemic to post-pandemic era. To enhance our analysis, we fine-tuned the LLaMA 3.1-8B model with labeled data, enabling precise sentiment classification of dream content. Our findings aim to uncover patterns in dream content, providing insights into the psychological effects of the pandemic and its influence on subconscious processes. This research highlights the profound changes in mental landscapes and the role of dreams as indicators of public well-being during unprecedented times.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The global pandemic brought by COVID-19 has significantly transformed our lives, imposing physical isolation and social activity restrictions (Ingram et al., 2021). These unprecedented changes have led to a substantial change in lifestyle for millions around the world. The pandemic gave popularity to online services like Zoom, Netflix, or Twitter, and hindered the development of many offline activities (Gupta & Singharia, 2021). With governments and global health organizations enforcing social distancing and quarantine policies, individuals had to adapt to a different lifestyle. The closure of offices and schools, along with many public spaces caused a digital transformation during that time period, forcing many workers to work from home and students taking classes remotely (Ingram et al., 2021). This shift, while maintaining productivity and education efficiency, has also introduced adversities like isolation, burnout, or a blurred boundary between work and personal life. The reliance on digital devices during the pandemic matter for work or entertainment also leads to a sedentary lifestyle (Gupta & Singharia, 2021). Moreover, the pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated existing inequalities. Access to technology, safe working conditions, and healthcare have varied significantly, affecting people's ability to cope with changes brought about by the pandemic. Vulnerable populations, mostly the elderly, the newborns, and the ones with pre-existing health conditions, face greater risks of infection (Ahmed, 2020). Overall, the pandemic's physical restrictions and social distancing have profoundly altered lifestyles globally. This shift to a more isolated existence has accelerated digital adoption for work, education, and social interaction, with many other changes in our daily lives, ultimately creating dramatic changes in our lifestyles.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought profound changes to both people's physical and mental landscapes back then, and dreams could be an indicator into one's subconscious responses in face of these challenges. While in search of reliable sources of dream contents of the public, the Reddit community came into my attention, which is a popular social media platform nowadays. Specifically, the Reddit r/Dreams server has a total of 374,000 subscribers and is one"}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "In recent years, the intersection between dreams and mental health had garnered increasing attention, particularly in light of the profound lifestyle alterations brought by the COVID-19 pandemic. As Usher and Durkin (2020) underscore, the global upheaval caused by the pandemic has caused a surge in mental health challenges worldwide. This surge has prompted scholars to delve into the complicated relationship between dream patterns and psychological well-being. As Solomonova and Carr (2019) mentioned in their publication, shifts in dream content may serve as indicators of underlying shifts in mental health states. Building upon this foundation, researchers such as Mellman et al. (2001) and Cvetkovi\u0107 et al. (2022) have further explored the nuances of this correlation, shedding light on the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of dream analysis in the field of mental health.\nExploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dreams and mental health had been a focal point of research endeavors. Liu et al. (2022) through their international study on Dream-enactment behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic substantiated the notion that the"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "The dataset input for this study is obtained from the Reddit Application Programming Interface (API) (Reddit dreams: Everything about dreams). After we downloaded the raw posts from Reddit r/Dreams server, we customized the time range from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2023. Later, with Natural Language Toolkit library (NLTK), python data analysis library (PANDAS) (McKinney, 2010; Bird et al, 2009), we filtered the selected posts using the following techniques:\n1. All special characters and newline characters were removed from the dataset.\n2. The dataset was changed to all lowercase.\n3. Empty entries (deleted posts) were removed from the dataset.\n4. Remove all stopwords (i.e. common words such as \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"and\", etc.) and punctuation in the dataset. Through these pre-processing steps, 98,147 cleaned entries are selected from the 105,000 raw dream posts. None-dream related contents are neglected in this study, as the Reddit r/Dreams server moderators manually supervise the server posts to prevent unrelated scam messages or advertisements from entering the server.\nLlama 3.1, an open-source, cutting-edge language model developed by Meta AI, represents a significant leap forward in natural language processing (NLP). Building on the"}, {"title": "Utilizing LoRA in our Training Process", "content": "In our training process, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune our language model with reduced computational overhead. LoRA allows us to adapt pre-trained models by injecting trainable low-rank matrices into the transformer layers, significantly decreasing the number of parameters needed for fine-tuning (Hu et al., 2021). This approach not only accelerates the training process but also conserves memory, making it feasible to fine-tune large models on limited hardware resources. By leveraging LoRA, we can swiftly adapt the model to specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis in Reddit dream posts, without compromising performance or accuracy."}, {"title": "Results and Discussion", "content": "To effectively leverage the 98,147 data points we collected, we manually cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy and reliability. We then introduced the LLaMA-3.1-8B model to fine-tune a sentiment analysis model specifically for COVID-related dream posts. This model was trained to recognize and categorize the emotional content of these posts into six primary sentiment scores: \"none-dream related\", \"joy\", \"anger\", \"sadness\", \"confusion\", \"neutral\", or \"fear\". As these six sentiment categories are highly representative of social media posts as commonly used among other sentiment analysis tasks (Nimmi et al., 2021). We annotated half of the dataset, which are 49073 entries, our first annotator is a student from Washington University in St. Louis, majoring in computer science and mathematics; our second annotator is a student from University of Michigan, majoring in computer engineering.\nTo gain insights into the emotional trends over time, we grouped the data points by week. For each week, we calculated the average scores for each sentiment category.

Initially, we focused on three emotions\u2014positive, negative, and neutral\u2014but expanded to train on six emotions, offering deeper insights into the collective mental state during this period of global stress. While this research provides valuable insights into dream content and its reflection of the population's mental status quo, it has several limitations. Notably, while correlations between dream sentiment and pandemic trends are identified, there is no direct evidence that pandemic trends cause specific dream content for individuals. Additionally, the study could be strengthened by using a broader data source from various social platforms worldwide. This research serves as an initial attempt at large-scale dream analysis as a mirror of societal stress, and more advanced"}]}

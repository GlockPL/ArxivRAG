{"title": "Beautimeter: Harnessing GPT for Assessing Architectural and Urban Beauty based on the 15 Properties of Living Structure", "authors": ["Bin Jiang"], "abstract": "Beautimeter is a new tool powered by generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technology, designed to evaluate architectural and urban beauty. Rooted in Christopher Alexander's theory of centers, this work builds on the idea that all environments possess, to varying degrees, an innate sense of life. Alexander identified 15 fundamental properties, such as levels of scale and thick boundaries, that characterize living structure, which Beautimeter uses as a basis for its analysis. By integrating GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter assesses the extent to which a structure embodies these 15 properties, enabling a nuanced evaluation of architectural and urban aesthetics. Using ChatGPT, the tool helps users generate insights into the perceived beauty and coherence of spaces. We conducted a series of case studies, evaluating images of architectural and urban environments, as well as carpets, paintings, and other artifacts. The results demonstrate Beautimeter's effectiveness in analyzing aesthetic qualities across diverse contexts. Our findings suggest that by leveraging GPT technology, Beautimeter offers architects, urban planners, and designers a powerful tool to create spaces that resonate deeply with people.

Introduction", "content": "Within the field of design, architectural and urban beauty has long been a central focus, yet few scholars have explored it as deeply as Christopher Alexander (1979, 1994, 2002\u20132005) and his co-workers (Alexander and Huggins 1964, Alexander and Carey 1968). Among Alexander's significant contributions is his theory of centers, which suggests that a built environment's beauty and coherence derive from the presence and arrangement of centers-distinct parts that contribute to a larger, cohesive whole. This theory posits that spaces possess an inherent 'aliveness' when these centers resonate with our inner experiences, fostering a deep, intuitive connection with those who inhabit or perceive these spaces (Alexander 2002\u20132005). Although the theory of centers offers profound insights into architectural and urban design, its practical application presents notable challenges. The theory's reliance on subjective perception of centers makes consistent evaluation across individuals and contexts complex, and the need for nuanced interpretation limits its scalability in broader architectural and urban design contexts."}, {"title": "2. Theoretical Framework", "content": "In this section, we look at the foundational concepts underpinning the development and application of Beautimeter. We begin by introducing the concept of living structure and the 15 fundamental properties that characterize spaces with a high degree of life, followed by two early surveys conducted by Alexander (2002\u20132005). We aim to provide a theoretical framework that forms the foundation of Beautimeter."}, {"title": "2.1 Living Structure and the 15 Fundamental Properties", "content": "Alexander (2002\u20132005) conceived and developed the concept of living structure from his earlier work on pattern languages and Turkish carpets (Alexander et al. 1977, Alexander 1979, 1993). And this concept of living structure extends beyond biological systems to include the structural qualities of any object or system. For example, the banyan trees shown in Figure 1 continue to embody living structures even when they are no longer biologically alive, showing that the idea of living structure continues beyond the biological realm into the realm of structural organization. Essentially, a living structure is characterized by the presence of a recurring pattern containing significantly more small substructures than large ones, which creates a rich hierarchy of forms. This trait applies whether the structure is biologically alive or not. Investigating the number of substructures in a structure, and the hierarchy that these substructures form shows the degree of \"livingness\" or spatial vitality in the structure (Jiang and de Rijke 2023). Humans can intuitively perceive this living quality, or the quality without a name (QWAN) (Alexander 1979), and often associate it with a sense of beauty. Living structure is to beauty what temperature is to warmth; the greater the degree to which a structure embodies the characteristics of living structure, the more the structure resonates with the innate human sense of beauty.\nThe 15 properties of living structure provide insights into what makes certain objects, spaces, or designs feel alive and harmonious (Figure 2). Rather than being abstract concepts, these properties are deeply rooted in how people perceive and interact with the world around them. These properties reflect the underlying order and coherence that contributes to a structure's spatial vitality and beauty, whether the structure is a building, a natural form, or even a city. When architects, planners, and urban designers understand and apply these properties, they can create environments that resonate with the intrinsic patterns of life and foster spaces that are functional and aesthetically pleasing. Among the 15 properties, the levels of scale property refers to the presence in a structure of multiple scales of size, from the smallest detail to the largest form, which creates a sense of balance and cohesion. Strong centers highlight the significance of focal points in a design, drawing the eye and creating a sense of order. Another key property is thick boundaries, which define the edges of substructures and spaces; this helps delineate and protect the integrity of forms. Alternating repetition and gradients introduce variation and transitions within a design, making it dynamic and engaging. Properties like local symmetries and positive space also contribute to a structure's sense of fullness and order. The 15 properties combine to deliver a comprehensive framework with which to understand and create living structures, with the beauty and coherence of the design being tied to its transformational and geometric characteristics.\nThe 15 properties have been distilled into two overarching laws \u2013 the scaling law (Jiang 2015) and Tobler's law (Tobler 1971) \u2013 that are foundational for understanding and characterizing living structure. Firstly, the scaling law is essentially the levels of scale property, asserting that, across any given structure, a hierarchy exists in which there are far more small substructures (or centers) than large ones. This distribution is seen across several levels of scale, from the smallest components within a system to the most significant elements. Having many small centers contributes to the overall structure's"}, {"title": "2.2 Two Surveys about the Mirror-of-the-Self Test (MOST)", "content": "The MOST is an important part of Alexander's broader architectural and urban theory, which emphasizes the creation of environments that resonate with people at an intrinsic level. The MOST was developed as an introspective tool and designed to assess whether a space possesses what Alexander (1979, 1993) termed QWAN (Gabriel 1998); that is, a sense of life, harmony, and wholeness (Alexander 2002-2005) that evokes a deep connection among the people who inhabit or perceive it. The MOST is based on Alexander's belief that all spaces can reflect, to some degree or other, people's emotional and psychological states. Based on his own work on pattern languages (Alexander et al. 1977, Alexander 1979) and on what makes buildings and environments feel \u201calive\u201d, Alexander (2002\u20132005) argued that people are able to intuitively recognize to what degree an architectural or urban environment reflects their sense of self, not just in an aesthetic sense, but related to a deeper \u2013 often unconscious \u2013 connection with the environment.\nThe MOST is part of Alexander's wider theoretical framework, which centered around the concept of living structure. Alexander argued that living structures are characterized by a high degree of order and coherence and multiple interrelated centers or substructures (Gabriel and Quillien 2019, Jiang and Huang 2021). These substructures are brought to life by applying the 15 fundamental properties listed in Figure 2. Each property contributes to the overall harmony and life of a space and makes the space resonate with the human spirit. The MOST is inherently objective, although it relies on an individual's intuitive response to a space, asking individuals to state whether they view themselves as reflected in the space and whether the space feels like a natural extension of their inner world. The MOST focuses on a space's emotional and psychological impact, aiming to determine whether a space has the life- giving qualities that, according to Alexander, are essential to achieve a truly human-centered built environment."}, {"title": "3. Development of Beautimeter", "content": "A significant innovation in assessing architectural and urban beauty emerged with the integration of GPT technology, specifically ChatGPT (OpenAI et al. 2023), into the theory of centers. Our goal in incorporating GPT was to standardize and scale the evaluation process, enabling broader application and analysis. The natural language processing capabilities of GPT allow it to interpret and respond to prompts related to the beauty and coherence of architectural and urban images through the lens of the theory of centers and its 15 fundamental properties. The primary challenge was ensuring that GPT could navigate the nuanced and objective nature of these assessments while remaining aligned with the principles of life-enhancing design. The resulting system prompts GPT to evaluate architectural and urban images using a structured yet adaptable rubric, leading to the generation of an overall beauty score that reflects the combined influence of the 15 properties."}, {"title": "3.1 Design and Functionality", "content": "The development of Beautimeter aimed to create a user-friendly tool powered by GPT that incorporates the theory of centers and the 15 fundamental properties of beauty. The design process began by defining the core functionality: enabling GPT to analyze two architectural and urban images and determine which one embodies a higher degree of beauty based on these properties. This was achieved by translating the properties into a scoring system that GPT could effectively utilize. By leveraging GPT's advanced natural language processing capabilities, Beautimeter prompted users to present two images of our daily lives, indicating which is more beautiful and providing the corresponding score for each image.\nBehind Beautimeter is a prompt similar to the following: \u201cGiven two images, I would like to know which is more beautiful or has a higher degree of beauty according to Alexander's 15 properties. Score the two images based on the 15 properties, with 15 being the highest and 0 being the lowest; in other words, each of the 15 properties is scored between 0 and 1\u201d. GPT processes the prompt and compares the images based on the encoded understanding of the 15 properties or the theory of centers in general and generates an overall beauty score for each image. The user interface (UI) of Beautimeter (Figure 4) was designed to be intuitive so that users could easily upload or capture any images and obtain results. The tool presents users with the comparison task, processes their input or two images, and then clearly and concisely displays the results (Figure 4). The UI also allows users to track their evaluations and compare results over time, thus offering a deeper understanding of how different spaces resonate with the principles of life-enhancing design."}, {"title": "3.2 Implementation", "content": "The implementation of Beautimeter faced virtually few challenges, demonstrating the powerful capabilities of GPT rather than the complexities of my research. As an expert in living structure theory, I can objectively assess the effectiveness of GPT in understanding the theory of centers and the 15 properties. We found that the natural language processing capabilities of GPT were inherently sufficient to reflect the nuances of the 15 properties. We tested the tool on a variety of images, including buildings and urban environments. Notably, despite our efforts to fine-tune the model, we discovered that GPT's out-of-the-box performance was already robust enough to meet our needs.\nThroughout the development process, our focus was on maintaining the integrity of Alexander's principles while leveraging GPT's strengths. The implementation was straightforward, resulting in a tool that is both technically sound and aligned with the results of the MOST conducted by Alexander (2002-2005). Ultimately, Beautimeter automates and enhances the assessment of architectural and urban beauty, offering users a profound understanding of human experience without the need for extensive adjustments."}, {"title": "4. Case Studies for Verification", "content": "We conducted a series of experiments that aimed to assess the ability of Beautimeter to evaluate and compare the aesthetic qualities of various architectural and urban images. We examined pairs of images, each of which represented varying degrees of beauty or vitality, as defined by Alexander (2002\u20132005), seeking to validate Beautimeter's effectiveness at capturing the nuanced and often seemingly subjective nature of human aesthetic judgment. The sub-sections below outline the methodology and results of the experiments and present some key insights into the relationship between living structure and perceived beauty."}, {"title": "4.1 Experiments with Pairs of Images", "content": "We investigated Beautimeter's applicability by conducting a series of experiments that involved evaluating 46 pairs of images. The images were sourced from the Nature of Order Book 1 (Alexander 2002-2005) \u2013 specifically, Chapter 2 \u201cDegrees of Life\" (Figure 4) and Chapter 8 \u201cThe Mirror of the Self' (Figure 5) \u2013 which include buildings, city scenes, paintings, and artifacts. These experiments explored the living structure concept by asking GPT which image in each pair showed a stronger sense of beauty or vitality. In the original context, Alexander (2002\u20132005) provided a form of ground truth by suggesting that the left-hand image in each pair generally embodied more beauty or vitality than the right-hand image. Our experiment sought to test this hypothesis by scoring each image, based on the 15 properties, via Beautimeter. The aim was to quantify the seemingly subjective yet consistent nature of human perception regarding what constitutes a living structure. Beautimeter was presented pairs of images and asked to evaluate which one exhibited a higher degree of beauty or life. Beautimeter generated a score for each image based on the 15 properties. The scoring did not include any specific articulation or elaboration and instead focused solely on the overall perception of beauty, as informed by these properties."}, {"title": "4.2 Results and Discussion", "content": "Tables 1 and 2 summarize the results of the experiments. The tables quantify the degree of beauty, as perceived through the lens of the 15 properties, which provides insights into the concept of living structure. Table 1 displays the scores for the image pairs from Figure 5, with the left- and right-hand images scored separately. Alexander proposed that the left-hand-side images generally possess more beauty or vitality than those on the right, yet the yellow-highlighted results in the table show instances where the right-hand-side images received higher scores than those on the left. Table 2 quantifies the results of the image pairs from Figure 6, and there are again cases where images on the right were rated higher than those on the left (again highlighted in yellow). The deviations shown in these two tables underline the complexities involved in applying the 15 properties to diverse visual contexts, revealing the powerfulness of GPT when evaluating beauty and vitality across different types of images.\nThe above results offer insights into the seemingly subjective nature of human perception when evaluating the concept of living structure or QWAN. Most of the results align with Alexander's original assessments; however, the examples of the right-hand images outscoring those on the left show that a range of factors \u2013 including personal experiences, cultural context, and the inherent diversity of the visual stimuli \u2013 influence the perception of beauty. Our findings strengthen the relevance of the 15 properties as a framework for assessing beauty, and also emphasize the need to consider individual variations in human perception. By quantifying such perceptions, Beautimeter offers a powerful tool with which to explore and validate the concept of living structure, both in objects and environments. As architecture and urban design evolve, Beautimeter and tools like it can help make sure that the spaces that people create resonate with the deep, intuitive sense of beauty and life that exists in buildings, cites, and even artifacts.\nBeautimeter relies mainly on the 15 properties of living structure to assess and score pairs of images in terms of their livingness automatically as never before thanks to the advance of GPT technology. While Beautimeter is largely relying on the number of the 15 properties, other methods gauge architectural"}, {"title": "5. Implications of Beautimeter and this Study", "content": "Beautimeter represents a significant advancement in assessing and designing architectural and urban spaces, reshaping our understanding of beauty in the built environment. This section explores its philosophical and practical implications, focusing on the contrasting organic and mechanical views of space. The organic perspective fosters a holistic approach, promoting designs that enhance community engagement and sustainability, while the mechanical view often prioritizes efficiency at the cost of aesthetic and emotional considerations. This dichotomy is vital, as it influences the effectiveness and ethical implications of Beautimeter, underscoring the need for a thoughtful application that respects the complexities of urban life and the responsibilities of designers.\nA central aspect of Alexander's work is the distinction between the organic and mechanical views of space and the world. The organic view (Whitehead 1929, Bohm 1980, Alexander 2002\u20132005) perceives space as a living entity that is strongly connected to human experience and emotions, and every element contributes to a coherent whole that resonates with life and beauty. The mechanical view (Descartes 1644, 1983), by contrast, treats space merely as a physical construct that is defined by functional and geometric properties and often lacks emotional and experiential richness. The MOST is conducted most effectively using the organic view for human subjects, which emphasizes the seemingly subjective, introspective nature of how people perceive and interact with their surroundings. By harnessing GPT technology, Beautimeter can help solve this sensitive issue of the MOST from the perspective of living structure or that of the 15 properties.\nBeautimeter can potentially have a significant impact on architectural and urban design. By providing architects and urban designers with a tool for assessing architectural and urban beauty, Beautimeter offers a new way of evaluating how well a space resonates with its users. This could lead to designs that are increasingly attuned to human needs and experiences and foster environments that function effectively, but also evoke a strong sense of place and belonging (Tuan 1977, Lewicka 2011, Seamon 2018, Mehaffy and Salingaros 2017, Salingaros 2020). Architects and urban designers could use Beautimeter during the design phases to test configurations and elements so that the final design aligns with the organic view of space. Such an approach could help avoid the creation of spaces that are technically functional but fail to resonate emotionally with their inhabitants. Beautimeter's ability to provide real-time feedback on the emotional impact of design choices could revolutionize how spaces are conceived and built. However, the use of AI in such a domain also raises certain limitations. While GPT technology can understand and process human responses, it lacks the innate human ability to fully grasp the subtleties of emotional and sensory experiences. Therefore, Beautimeter should be used as a complement to human judgment and intuition in the design process rather than as a replacement for it.\nBeautimeter can have significant implications for areas of design and planning other than just architecture and urban planning and design. In fields where human experiences play a critical role, such"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "The development and application of Beautimeter, which integrates the advanced GPT technology, represents a significant advance in assessing and understanding architectural and urban beauty, and even beyond. By harnessing the intelligent capabilities of GPT, Beautimeter offers a scalable and consistent method for evaluating whether architectural and urban spaces resonate with the intrinsic sense of life and beauty emphasized by Alexander's theory of centers. Thus, Beautimeter not only automates the evaluation of architectural and urban beauty, but also enhances its applicability and accessibility across a wide range of urban and architectural environments. Exploring Beautimeter's application via a number of case studies has shown the potential of the tool to connect human aesthetic judgment with the processing power of AI. Our results highlight some of the complexities and nuances involved in perceiving beauty, revealing the strengths but also the limitations of using AI to quantify such personal yet shared experiences. While Beautimeter successfully offers valuable insights into the living structure of spaces, it also underscores the importance of maintaining a balance between Al-driven analysis and the inherently human elements of architectural and urban design.\nThe implications of this study extend beyond architecture and urban design, suggesting new possibilities for using AI in urban planning, design, and other fields where human experience is central. However, while integrating AI into these traditionally human-centric domains, we must remain aware of ethical considerations and ensure that technology enhances rather than diminishes the organic, intuitive aspects of design. Moving forward, Beautimeter will serve as a tool, but also as a reminder of the ongoing dialogue between technology and the timeless principles of beauty that guide architectural and urban practice."}]}

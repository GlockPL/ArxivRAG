{"title": "SHADOWED AHP FOR MULTI-CRITERIA SUPPLIER SELECTION", "authors": ["Mohamed Abdel Hameed El-Hawy"], "abstract": "Numerous techniques of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) have been proposed in a variety of business domains. One of the well-known methods is the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Various uncertain numbers are commonly used to represent preference values in AHP problems. In the case of multi-granularity linguistic information, several methods have been proposed to address this type of AHP problem. This paper introduces a novel method to solve this problem using shadowed fuzzy numbers (SFNs). These numbers are characterized by approximating different types of fuzzy numbers and preserving their uncertainty properties. The new Shadowed AHP method is proposed to handle preference values which are represented by multi-types of uncertain numbers. The new approach converts multi-granular preference values into unified model of shadowed fuzzy numbers and utilizes their properties. A new ranking approach is introduced to order the results of aggregation preferences. The new approach is applied to solve a supplier selection problem in which multi-granular information are used. The features of the new approach are significant for decision-making applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Multiple techniques are developed to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems. When criteria evaluation is subjective and non-numeric, different types of fuzzy sets have been proposed to address this problem. The Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP method is one of the most important decision-making techniques that formalizing problems using a hierarchical structure. The basis of this methodology is the development of a pair-wise comparison between criteria and, similarly, between alternatives. In the literature, many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem using different types of uncertain numbers. The type-1 fuzzy numbers are the earliest form used for representing vague information and have been ap-plied in pair-wise comparisons for AHP problems. The first work is presented by Van Laarhoven et al. [1] which uses triangular fuzzy numbers. Buckley [2] developed fuzzy priorities for comparison values whose membership functions are trapezoidal. Chang [3] proposed a new approach for solving fuzzy AHP and used triangular fuzzy numbers. He presented the extent analysis method for the synthetic extent values of the pairwise comparisons. In the case of the supplier selection problem, different approaches are proposed. For example, Kahraman et al. [4] and Kilincci et al. [5] used the extent analysis method for fuzzy AHP to select the best supplier firms. Yang et al. [6] proposed a new approach using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) to map out the relationships among the sub-criteria and fuzzy AHP to compute the relative weights for each criterion. Chen et al. [7] and Sun [8] use two integrated approaches fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS to select the best supplier. Pitchipoo et al. [9] combined two methods: fuzzy AHP for processing pairwise comparison matrices and grey relational analysis (GRA) for ranking sup-pliers. Ayhan et al. [10] developed a new approach that processes in two stages. In the first stage, the relative weights of each criterion are obtained by fuzzy AHP. In the next stage, the output of the previous step is the input of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model which determines the suppliers and the quantities to be provided. In the study by Kar [11], the hybrid technique is applied, which combines fuzzy AHP and neural networks to provide group decision support under consensus achievement. AHP methods are developed with higher types of fuzzy sets. The studies of G\u00f6rener et al [12] and Celik et al. [13] are examples of interval type-2 AHP. Xu et al. [14] and Duleba et al., [15] use intuitionistic fuzzy numbers in AHP problems.\n\nThe AHP method becomes more complex when comparisons are made using linguistic terms with different granular meanings. In the literature, some approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. Alsawy et al. [16] developed the new granular model, which considers a unified granular number to represent multi-granular numbers. Chatterjee et al. [17] applied these numbers with a fusion approach and used them with the VIKOR model. In the study by Aydin et al. [18], the transform technique is developed to convert three types of numbers (crisp, interval, and triangular fuzzy numbers) to standardized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (STFN). In this paper, we will use the shadowed fuzzy numbers concept to deal with the multi-granular numbers problem. The multi- granular numbers are used for pair wise matrices. Multi-granular preferences include exact numbers, interval numbers, type-1 fuzzy numbers with two different types (triangular and Gaussian), and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. To handle different granular numbers, the shadowed fuzzy numbers are used to unify different uncertain numbers. The new shadowed AHP algorithm is applied to solve supplier selection problems. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the basic definitions of fuzzy sets, fuzzy numbers, shadowed sets, and shadowed fuzzy numbers (SFNs). In section 3, we introduce the proposed shadowed AHP method. Section 4, we present a numerical example that solves the AHP multi-granular supplier selection problem. In Section 5, the main features of the pro-posed approach are discussed. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 6."}, {"title": "2. DEFINITIONS AND PRELIMINARIES", "content": "2.1. Fuzzy sets\n\nFuzzy sets are used to model linguistic terms by introducing gradual memberships. The membership function of a fuzzy set B is defined as follows [19]:\n\nB: X \u2192 [0, 1]\n\nA fuzzy number (FN) B is a fuzzy set defined on the real numbers scale R with the following conditions [20, 21, 31].\n1.

Shadowed sets", "content": "Shadowed sets are information granules constructed from fuzzy sets. These sets capture the essence of fuzzy sets, reducing computational costs and increasing the ability for interpretation. Shadowed set S defined as [22, 23]\n\nS: X \u2192 {0,1, [0,1]}\n\nWhen constructing a shadowed set, the fuzzy set membership function is replaced with a form similar to three-valued logic. The first step is selecting the threshold \u03b1 \u2208 (0,0.5) to induce a shadowed set. The outcome of this step is the construction of three regions, as illustrated in Figure 2. The first region is reformulated by decreasing all membership values less than the threshold \u03b1 to 0. The second region is constructed by elevated membership values greater than 1-\u03b1 to 1. The third region is unknown membership values or shadow regions for membership values around 0.5 [23] as illustrated in Figure 1. Selecting \u03b1 is related to achieving a balance of uncertainty between the shadow region and the uncertainty lost by elevating and reducing the membership values to build the core and exclusion areas, as illustrated in the following equation [22].\n\nv(r\u2081) + v(r2) = v(r3)\n\nwhere v is uncertainty of regions r\u2081, r2, r3.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE", "content": "In this section, we will apply a new approach to select the best supplier of ready-mixed concrete for a project located in a large city. The following example from [32] is shown in Figure 6. Three suppliers' alternatives (A1, A2, A3)produce the mix in accordance with a precise specification. Four criteria are used to evaluate the qualification of the supplier: the price of the mix (C\u2081), the location of the batching plant (C2), the terms of payment (C3), and the batching plant's capacity (C4). The pairwise comparisons of the criteria's relative importance matrix values vary between exact values, interval numbers (INs), type-l fuzzy numbers and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs), as in Tables 2 and 3. Also, two different types of fuzzy numbers are used to compare between criteria, i.e. triangular (TFNs) and Gaussian fuzzy numbers (GFNs). We apply a new method to rank the suppliers using the following steps:\nStep 1: Pairwise comparison matrices between alternatives for each criterion are created as in Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7. These matrices' values are represented in the form of crisp numbers, TFNs, GFNs and IFNs. The consistency ratio is calculated by using crisp numbers in Table 1, and the result is less than the threshold value of 0.1.\nStep 2: Transform multi-granular values of matrices to shadowed fuzzy numbers (SFNs), as in Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. We use the (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10) and (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), and (20).\nStep 3: The SFN geometric mean value for each criterion is calculated according to (26) from Table 8. Also, the same mean is computed for each pairwise comparison matrix between alternatives from Tables 9, 10, 11, and 12.\nStep 4: The normalized weight of each criterion is calculated according to (27). The results are shown in Table 13.\nStep 5: The normalized priority for every alternative according to the particular criterion is determined using the (26) and (27) and the results are illustrated in Table 14.\nStep 6: The final priority or preference value of each alternative is calculated using (28) and the result is shown in Table 15.\nStep 7: To rank the final preference SFNs, we obtained the rank index using (29),(30), (31), (32), (33), and (34) as the following: R(A\u2081) = 0.221, R(A2) = 0.372 and R(A3) = 0.4242.

[16], Chatterjee et al. [17], and Aydin et al. [18] the following remarks are found:\n1) With the methods Alsawy et al. [16], and Chatterjee et al. [17], G-numbers represent a higher level of abstraction but do not consider different types of uncertainty which the current method outperforms.\n2) In the Aydin et al. approach [18], transform only crisp, interval, and type-1 fuzzy numbers. The newly proposed approach converts the previous types in addition to the higher types of fuzzy numbers.\n3) The new approach uses the uncertainty properties of aggregation preference values of alternatives to rank them.\n4) Solving the same illustrative example adopted by Biruk et al. [32], using the proposed approach results in the same ranking of alternatives even though different types of granular information are used. This demonstrates the validity of the proposed method."}, {"title": "6. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "In multi-granular AHP problems, different types of uncertain numbers are used to express relative preferences between criteria and similarly with alternatives. To solve this pattern of AHP problems, a new algorithm called shadowed AHP is proposed. It converts different types of numbers, including crisp, interval, type-1 fuzzy, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, to shadowed fuzzy numbers. The new shadowed AHP steps have been developed. Also, a new ranking method is proposed to rank the results of the evaluation values of alternatives, which are represented in the form of shadowed fuzzy numbers. The new algorithm is applied to multi-attribute supplier selection decision-making problems. The new technique unifies the form of linguistic terms and, at the same time, preserves the features of uncertainty in input information. It is superior to previous methods that transformed different types of granular numbers into unified uncertain numbers with preserved uncertainty patterns in the input multi-granular information. Also, it can be used with higher types of fuzzy numbers. The rank of alternatives is based on their uncertainty features."}]}

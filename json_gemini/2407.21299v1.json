INTRODUCTION", "content": "Comparing multiple computational models for their per-formance is crucial for enhancing trust in model outcomesbecause it provides a basis for evaluating the reliability andconsistency of each model [2], [10], [12]. By assessing howdifferent models perform under various conditions and scenar-ios, stakeholders can better understand their strengths, weak-nesses, and overall effectiveness. Such comparative analysishelps to identify the most suitable model for specific tasksor applications, thereby instilling confidence in the reliabilityof the chosen model. This becomes more important whilepredicting the net load of an electric grid, which is defined asthe difference between total electricity demand and generationfrom behind-the-meter resources like solar and distributed gen-erators, and is influenced by various factors such as weatherconditions and time of day [3], [15].\nAccurate net load forecasting enables grid operators, poli-cymakers, and energy providers to make informed decisionsregarding energy trade, load distribution, and resource alloca-tion. However, the rise of solar energy generation sources inresidential settings has significantly impacted the performanceof traditional net load forecasting models, highlighting theneed for robust time-series forecasting techniques [6]. Collaborating with scientists, we developed a deep-learning modelthat integrates variables such as temperature, humidity, appar-ent power, and solar irradiance to achieve strong predictiveperformance and resilience in the face of missing data [14].However, the model's sensitivity to seasonal variations andnoisy inputs underscores the need for further exploration withdomain experts. Hence, we developed an interactive tool thatempowers users to investigate the model's performance acrossdiverse time periods and input scenarios [1].\nHowever, while we initially recognized the importance ofcomparing the model's performance with traditional models,feedback from domain experts further emphasized its signif-icance in building trust in model outcomes. Visual analyticscan play a pivotal role here, as evidenced by prior researchdemonstrating its importance in enhancing trust in machinelearning models [4]. This is exemplified by the interactivetool we developed, which enabled domain experts to extractvaluable insights concerning the model's sensitivity towardtemperature and humidity. Moreover, recent discourse, ashighlighted in [8], emphasizes the critical role of visualanalytics in fostering trust-augmented applications of artificialintelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) within the energysector. Building upon this, we designed our application, incor-porating carefully selected visual analytic interventions. Theseinterventions facilitate the comparison of multiple modelsacross various parameters, including solar penetration levels,dataset resolutions, and different hours of the day, enhancingstakeholders' confidence in model performance.\nThe aim of our application is to build trust through modelcomparison, primarily comparing our net load forecastingmodel with a reference model. We enhanced our model toprocess inputs at varying resolutions and then devised thereference model, which generates predictions by averaging netload ground truths for the last 30 days at the same time point.Despite lacking predictive ML components, this referencemodel serves as a benchmark in various net load forecastingcompetitions, including the recent Net Load Forecasting Prizeby the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) andthe U.S. Department of Energy Solar Technologies Office(SETO) [13]. Through the web interface of our application,we were able to uncover patterns in the performance that helpimprove trust in the model outcomes. In this work, we identifythe visual analytic tasks that are required to compare these"}, {"title": "II. MODEL DESCRIPTION", "content": "We start with a deep learning-based probabilistic modeltailored for net load forecasting in high behind-the-meter solarsenarios [14]. This model has three key components: a ker-nelized probabilistic forecasting (kPF) module, an autoencoder(AE), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Thismodel effectively captured complex temporal dependenciesand uncertainties inherent in net load data, which is crucialfor reliable forecasting in environments with high solar pen-etration. By incorporating kernel methods into probabilisticforecasting, the model handled non-linear relationships andcaptured subtle variations in net load influenced by solarenergy fluctuations. The autoencoder component enhancedfeature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating theLSTM network's ability to capture long-term dependenciesand predict future net load values accurately. Experimentalresults demonstrated the superior performance of this modelcompared to traditional forecasting models, showcasing itsefficacy in addressing the challenges posed by high solarscenarios and advancing the state-of-the-art in net-load fore-casting methodologies.\nThis model was used in the Net Load Forecasting Prizecompetition hosted by NREL and SETO [13]. However, duringthis competition, we observed its underperformance on thedata provided by the organizers, which had lower resolutions.We discovered that while the autoencoder component excelledwith high-resolution datasets (such as 15-minute intervals),it struggled to effectively capture temporal dependencies inlower-resolution datasets (e.g., 1-hour intervals provided bythe organizers). Consequently, this limitation led to subparoutcomes generated by the LSTM component. In light of this,we opted to remove the kPF and autoencoder componentsand instead developed a version of the model solely utilizingthe LSTM component. Additionally, fine-tuning the number oflayers in the LSTM component yielded significantly improvedresults in the competition.\nThe competition employed a reference model to assessmodel performance across various probability levels. As pre-viously mentioned, this reference model simply utilizes histor-ical input data from the past 30 days to generate probabilisticforecasts for a specific time point. This model can serve ashe initial benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of othermodels. Therefore, in this work, we developed a referencemodel following the same principles. Since these forecasts areprobabilistic in nature, we calculated the Continuous RankedProbability Score (CRPS) for both the reference model and ourmodel. Subsequently, we computed the Continuous RankedProbability Skill Score (CRPSS) based on these CRPS scores,evaluating whether our forecast presents an improvement ordeterioration compared to the reference forecast [5], [17]. Apositive CRPSS indicates that the forecast outperforms thereference forecast, whereas a negative value suggests inferiorperformance. Utilizing these CRPSS values, we compare theperformance of our model against the reference model acrossmultiple dates throughout the year, and present these valuesin our application."}, {"title": "III. VISUAL ANALYTICS-BASED DESIGN", "content": "Our application employs a visual analytics-based designfeaturing coordinated views enhanced with visual cues to helpusers compare model performance. It combines interactivevisualization with comparison metrics like CRPSS to improvetrust in the model outcomes and also allows the users to probethe model and understand its performance across different so-lar penetration levels and months. In this section, we highlightthe two tasks performed by our application and how its visualanalytics-based design aids in executing these tasks:\nT1: Compare model performance across different solar pen-etration levels and data resolutions: Model performance mayvary across different solar penetration levels due to the in-creased variability in net load data caused by intermittent solargeneration. LSTM-based models might struggle to captureand predict these dynamic behaviors accurately. Furthermore,datasets with higher resolutions, such as sub-hourly intervals,enable models to more effectively capture short-term fluctua-tions and dependencies. Hence, this task essentially involvescomparing model performance at different solar penetrationlevels and data resolutions.\nT2: Identify patterns across different timeframes: By analyzingperformance across multiple timeframes, power scientists canassess the net load forecasting models' robustness and consis-tency in capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-termtrends. This evaluation helps to identify whether a model'sperformance is consistent across various temporal scales or"}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS FROM A CASE STUDY", "content": "The efficacy of an application can be validated if theapplication is able to perform the intended tasks effectively.In this section, we show the results through a case study thatdemonstrates how our application can be used to compare andselect net load forecasting models effectively.\nThis case study involved a power scientist with over 10years of experience in power and grid systems. With expertisein nonlinear dynamics, large-scale networks, and distributedcontrol, he played a crucial role in developing the model.His main objective was to assess the model's performancerelative to the reference model across various time points andsolar penetration levels, which are critical factors to considerbefore deploying it for a project. We informed him that we hadintegrated CRPSS values for both the model and the referencemodel for all dates throughout the year. He then accessed ourapplication through a browser and examined the distributionof CRPSS values across different data frequencies at a 20%solar penetration level (Figure 2a). Notably, he discoveredthat the model performed better with the lower resolutiondataset (1-hour), contrary to expectations for an LSTM-basedmodel (T1). Upon further examination, he noted a marginaldifference in the median CRPSS between high and low-resolution datasets (0.85 and 0.89, respectively). Therefore, heenabled the comparison mode through the Sidebar, enablinghim to assess the model's performance as solar penetrationincreased. He noted that the model consistently performed wellwith the higher resolution dataset (15-min) across all othersolar penetration levels, confirming the notion that our modelexcels with high-resolution datasets in high solar penetrationscenarios (Figures 2b and 2c). Next, he observed that althoughthe median CRPSS was significantly above zero, the minimum"}, {"title": "V.

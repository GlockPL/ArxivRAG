{"title": "Enhanced Rooftop Solar Panel Detection by Efficiently Aggregating Local Features", "authors": ["Kuldeep Kurte", "Kedar Kulkarni"], "abstract": "In this paper, we present an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) panel detection approach using satellite images. We propose to use pre-trained CNN-based model to extract the local convolutional features of rooftops. These local features are then combined using the Vectors of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) technique to obtain rooftop-level global features, which are then used to train traditional Machine Learning (ML) models to identify rooftop images that do and do not contain PV panels. On the dataset used in this study, the proposed approach achieved rooftop-PV classification scores exceeding the predefined threshold of 0.9 across all three cities for each of the feature extractor networks evaluated. Moreover, we propose a 3-phase approach to enable efficient utilization of the previously trained models on a new city or region with limited labelled data. We illustrate the effectiveness of this 3-phase approach for multi-city rooftop-PV detection task.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Accurate information on existing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on building rooftops is essential for effective solar capacity planning, allowing manufacturers to target marketing efforts in areas with many no-rooftop-PV buildings. While manual data collection can provide such information, it is often time-consuming, labor- intensive, and costly [1]. In contrast, utilizing satellite or aerial imagery for rooftop-PV detection offers a scalable and cost-effective solution. This paper focuses on detecting buildings with and without rooftop-PVs using high-resolution satellite images.\nMost rooftop-PV detection studies in the literature focus on segmenting rooftop-PV panels using high-resolution satellite imagery and hand-labeled training data of rooftop-PV, which are costly and labor-intensive to produce [2-6]. As a result, these studies were often limited to specific regions or cities, hindering performance assessment for multi-city rooftop-PV detection tasks. An exception is DeepSolar++ [2], which trained a CNN-based rooftop-PV detection model using approximately 18,000 high- resolution satellite images from 50 U.S. cities. However, such extensive datasets may not be readily available in other countries with diverse rooftops and PV patterns, making it difficult to train CNN-based models with limited labeled data.\nWe propose an approach to efficiently utilize the limited labelled dataset of rooftops (with and without PV) for a multi-city rooftop- PV detection task. Typically, PV panels occupy a specific portion of the rooftop area, appearing homogeneous in texture and color in the satellite image, when compared to the portion that does not have PV panels [1]. To exploit this image-level homogeneity of rooftop- PVs, we use pre-trained CNN models to extract local features. Next, we employ VLAD [7] to fuse local features into fixed-length global features per rooftop, which are then used to train traditional ML models for rooftop-PV classification. Further, the trained rooftop-PV classification models can be transferred across cities in a stepwise manner, based on the proposed 3-phase approach, by efficiently using new (limited) labelled data and previously trained models. More details on the 3-phase approach are provided in Section II.\nOur work differs from previous approaches in the following ways: 1) we formulate the problem as a rooftop image classification task as opposed to a segmentation task, 2) we assume limited availability of labelled data, which, in practice, is typically obtained incrementally, i.e., one city at a time; 3) we propose VLAD-based fusion of sub-rooftop-level local features; and 4) we propose a 3- phase approach to efficiently utilize a pre-trained rooftop-PV model on multiple cities with limited labels.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines two rooftop- PV classification approaches and introduces a 3-phase method for extending rooftop-PV classification to multiple cities. Section 3 presents benchmarking results for these methods, while Section IV offers concluding remarks and future directions for rooftop-PV detection."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "In this work, we evaluated two approaches for rooftop-PV classification, as shown in Fig. 1.\nBuilding-Rooftop (BR-ML) classification: In this approach, a building's rooftop image is classified as either \u201cwith-PV\u201d or \u201cwith- no-PV\". The rooftop images were obtained by clipping high- resolution satellite images using the corresponding building footprint geometries. As a result, the rooftop images vary in size. The BR-ML approach first resize variable-sized images to a"}, {"title": "3 Results and Discussions", "content": "To evaluate multi-city rooftop-PV detection, we obtained high- resolution rooftop images via the Google Static Map API [9] for three regions in the state of Maharashtra, India: Reliance Corporate Park (RCP) campus, Chakan town, and Pune city. Using internal building footprint data, we manually labelled a few buildings from each city/region as \"with-PV\u201d or \u201cwith-no-PV.\" \nWe calculated F1-scores at both city-level as well as at a global- level (i.e., considering all cities together)."}, {"title": "4 Conclusions", "content": "In this work, we demonstrated BRG-VLAD-ML approach for rooftop-PV classification, which decomposes rooftop image into regular-sized grid images. It extracts the grid-level local features using pre-trained CNN models, fuses them using VLAD technique to obtain rooftop-level global features, and further train ML models for rooftop classification. This approach achieved a better weighted F1-score compared to the BR-ML approach while maintaining its city-level F1-scores well above the threshold of 0.9 across all the cities for each of the backbone networks considered in this work. Additionally, we proposed a 3-phase method to efficiently use pre- trained models for multi-city rooftop-PV detection with limited labelled data. In the future, we plan to evaluate the generalization capability of BRG-VLAD-ML approach across a larger number of cities."}]}

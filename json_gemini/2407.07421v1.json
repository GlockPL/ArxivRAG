While traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (ML-IDS) effectively employ supervised learning methods, they possess limitations such as the requirement for labeled data and challenges with high dimensionality. Recent unsupervised ML-IDS approaches such as AutoEncoders and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) offer alternative solutions but pose challenges in deployment onto resource-constrained IoT devices and in interpretability. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a novel federated unsupervised anomaly detection framework FedPCA that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Alternating Directions Method Multipliers (ADMM) to learn common representations of distributed non-i.i.d. datasets. Building on the FedPCA framework, we propose two algorithms, FEDPE in Euclidean space and FEDPG on Grassmann manifolds. Our approach enables real-time threat detection and mitigation at the device level, enhancing network resilience while ensuring privacy. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical convergence rates even under a sub-sampling scheme, a novel result. Experimental results on the UNSW-NB15 and TON-IoT datasets show that our proposed methods offer performance in anomaly detection comparable to non-linear baselines, while providing significant improvements in communication and memory efficiency, underscoring their potential for securing IoT networks.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "HE ubiquity of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a transformative shift where intelligent devices exchange information and enact decisions via the internet, requiring minimal human intervention. This has significantly enhanced the quality of life and found applications across numerous sectors such as smart city infrastructures [1], energy systems [2], or climate systems [3]. However, as the IoT ecosystem expands and becomes increasingly complex, ensuring robust network security emerges as a paramount task, especially considering the inherent security vulnerabilities of many IoT devices due to their limited computational resources [4].\nIn this intricate landscape, machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (ML-IDS) form a crucial line of defense. These systems often utilize supervised learning methods that range from traditional techniques to more sophisticated deep learning approaches [5]. While effective in various scenarios, they come with several limitations. For instance, they necessitate access to a considerable volume of labeled data, which can be time-consuming and costly to generate. Additionally, they often struggle with high-dimensional data and are limited in their ability to detect novel anomalies not represented in the training data. In contrast, recent unsupervised ML-IDS methods, such as AutoEncoders [6] and GAN-based models [7], [8], provide anomaly detection by learning representation of normal behavior without relying on labeled data. However, these techniques often involve training deep neural network models, which can be computationally demanding and lack clear interpretability [9] \u2013 factors that pose significant challenges for resource-limited IoT devices.\nTraditionally, most ML-IDS lean on centralized deployment which is becoming less feasible in IoT networks due to privacy concerns and resource limitations. Hence, there's a heightened demand for distributed security frameworks where IoT devices can have self-monitoring capabilities that allow them to identify potential threats in their network traffic while contributing their insights to the broader system. Such a distributed approach would considerably enhance the resilience of IoT networks, enabling real-time anomaly detection and mitigation in heterogeneous environments. In light of this, Federated Learning (FL) has stepped in as a promising paradigm that allows IoT devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while retaining their data locally, thereby harmonizing privacy preservation and efficient resource utilization. Despite its potential, the exploration of federated unsupervised IDS under the heterogeneity of IoT traffic remains relatively nascent, indicating the need for further research in this area.\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce a novel feder- ated unsupervised anomaly detection framework that leverages the representation power of PCA [10] and the decomposability of ADMM [11], namely FedPCA [12]. Specifically, we aim to harness PCA's capabilities to learn a common representation of distributed non-i.i.d datasets via consensus optimization that captures the hidden states within the data. These hidden states typically reflect complex correlations and underlying patterns within the data, which are instrumental in effective anomaly detection. In order to solve FedPCA, we design two distinct algorithms including FedPCA in Euclidean space (FEDPE) and"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "Federated Learning (FL) represents a cutting-edge distributed learning approach that allows for the execution and subsequent updating of machine learning models across thousands of participating devices, while simultaneously safeguarding against data leaks [15]. In FL, models are deployed and trained locally on individual clients' devices using local data. These locally trained models are then transmitted back to the central server for aggregation, such as weight averaging [16]. Thanks to the attributes of efficient communication and privacy protection, FL proves highly advantageous for IoT networks and applications. Various versions of FL have been developed after the birth of the standard FedAvg [16], significantly augmenting the intelli- gence of IoT systems across a multitude of applications [17].\nThe primary challenges of FL can be broadly classified into two categories: communication bottlenecks, resulting from the need to exchange large model's parameters between parties, and data heterogeneity, arising from the diversity of the data held by FL clients. This motivated some prior works to design more communication-efficient strategies such as local updates [18]\u2013 [20], model compression [21], and adaptive communication [22]. Meanwhile, data heterogeneity concerned with clients' non-i.i.d. data has also been well-studied [23], [24].\nGrassmann manifold optimization has recently gained trac- tion as an advanced mathematical tool in the fields of machine learning. This approach leverages the geometric properties of Grassmann manifolds, a space representing linear sub- spaces, to facilitate the analysis and understanding of high- dimensional data, thereby enabling efficient optimization and enhanced modeling in various machine learning and data analysis tasks [25]. In centralized learning, the optimization over Grassmann manifolds has been employed to enhance manifold learning and data classification, with applications extending to computer vision and speech recognition [26]\u2013 [28]. In decentralized learning contexts, particularly in FL, Grassmann learning has not fully explored yet, making it a promising avenue for continued research and development.\nOwing to their inherent vulnerabilities, IoT systems require robust measures against malicious activities [29]. This need has propelled anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) into the limelight, bolstered by the radical advancements in machine learning. Early research on anomaly-based IDS within IoT networks has been heavily centered around methodologies where data is consolidated onto a central server [30]\u2013[35], raising concerns related to privacy and cyber intrusions. The recent trend has veered towards the use of FL frame- works for network anomaly detection. For example, Nguyen et al. [36] developed a federated intrusion detection system using Recurrent Neural Network models that were trained on local gateways and then amalgamated into a single model. Similarly, Wang et al. [37] demonstrated how a feed-forward artificial neural network can augment detection performance. Mothukuri"}, {"title": "III.

PCA projects a given dataset X onto principal components ordered by the amount of variance they capture in the data [54]. Specifically, it seeks an optimal rank-k (k < d) matrix X that minimizes the reconstruction error $||X \u2013 X||_F$, where $|| ||_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm [55]. Typically, X is derived based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of X, i.e., X = UDVT, where U \u2208 Rdxd is an orthonormal matrix containing the left singular vectors of X, \u03a3 = diag(\u03c31,...,\u03c3\u03b1) contains the singular values (\u03c31 \u2265 02 > ... > \u03c3\u03b1), and V \u2208 RD\u00d7D contains the right singular vectors of X. Let U(k) \u2208 Rd\u00d7k be the first k columns of U and \u2211k = diag(\u03c31,...,\u03c3\u03ba). We can rewrite the solution for X as\n$X = U(k)U(k)^TX$,\nwhich can be interpreted as the projection of data matrix X onto the column space of U(k).

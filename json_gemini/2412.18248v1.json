The application of machine learning techniques helps improve the diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson's disease detection but only few studies have presented work towards the prediction of disease progression. In this research work, Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) was trained using the diagnostic features on Parkinson patients speech signals, to predict the disease progression while a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) was trained on the same diagnostic features to detect the disease. Diagnostic features selected using two well-known feature selection methods named Relief-F and Sequential Forward Selection and applied on LSTM and MLP have shown to accurately predict the disease progression as stage 2 and 3 and its existence respectively.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive and degenerative illness that affects the nervous system and impairs movement control [1, 2]. It typically affects around one percentage of the population over the age of 60, with an occurrence rate of approximately 250 individuals per 100,000 people [3, 4]. While signs and symptoms can vary from one patient to another, common speech-related symptoms for Parkinson's disease patients include reduced volume of speech, a monotonous pitch, changes in voice quality, and abnormally fast speech, often referred to as hypokinetic dysarthria. People with Parkinson's disease may not realize that they are speaking softly, so others often ask them to speak louder [4].\nApproximately 90% of individuals with PD also experience some form of speech difficulty. This has led to a growing interest in utilizing voice measurements to detect and monitor the symptoms of PD.

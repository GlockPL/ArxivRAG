With the increasing application of gravity field data in these areas, traditional calibration methods based on single features are becoming inadequate for capturing the complex characteristics of gravity fields and addressing the intricate interrelationships among multidimensional data. This paper proposes an attention-enhanced algorithm for gravity adaptation zone calibration. By introducing an attention mechanism, the algorithm adaptively fuses multidimensional gravity field features and dynamically assigns feature weights, effectively solving the problems of multicollinearity and redundancy inherent in traditional feature selection methods, significantly improving calibration accuracy and robustness.In addition, a large-scale gravity field dataset with over 10,000 sampling points was constructed, and Kriging interpolation was used to enhance the spatial resolution of the data, providing a reliable data foundation for model training and evaluation. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative experiments on several classical machine learning models (such as SVM, GBDT, and RF), and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves performance across these models, outperforming other traditional feature selection methods. The method proposed in this paper provides a new solution for gravity adaptation zone calibration, showing strong generalization ability and potential for application in complex environments.

Introduction", "content": "Accurate calibration of gravity adaptation zones is of great significance in fields such as underwater navigation, geophysical exploration, and marine engineering [1]. In complex underwater environments, accurate gravity adaptation zone calibration not only improves the positioning accuracy of navigation systems but also effectively ensures the safety and efficiency of underwater operations [1, 2]. With the continuous advancement of underwater technology, traditional navigation methods can no longer meet modern requirements for high precision and reliability. Therefore, researchers have gradually realized the potential of gravity field data in underwater navigation, which can effectively assist in positioning and path planning by providing information related to variations in the Earth's gravity field [3].

Therefore, the development of more precise calibration"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "The development of pre-trained models has significantly improved the performance of gravity adaptation zone calibration tasks. Early gravity field models such as EGM2008 [9] provided a high-resolution reference model of Earth's gravity field. EGM2008 utilized satellite, ground gravity, and topographic data from around the globe, extending the degree and order of spherical harmonic expansion to 2190, making it a high-resolution global static gravity field benchmark model. This model is widely used in geographic information systems and various gravity field applications, laying the foundation for subsequent research. EGM2020, an improved version of EGM2008, is expected to include updated global data with higher accuracy. Similar to EGM2008, EGM2020 will continue to use spherical harmonic expansion, but its improvements lie in the integration of new data from satellite missions such as GOCE and GRACE, further enhancing the model's spatial resolution and gravity field accuracy. The improved accuracy of EGM2020, especially in high-resolution global gravity field modeling, significantly enhances the capability of gravity field feature analysis, making it more suitable for precise gravity adaptation zone calibration. Based on these pre-trained gravity models, researchers have gradually explored ways to further improve the accuracy of gravity field adaptation analysis in gravity matching navigation tasks. Li et al. (2020) proposed a gravity matching navigation adaptability analysis method based on EGM2008, generating a gravity adaptability distribution map through interpolation and densification of marine gravity field characteristic parameters, thereby automatically calibrating adaptation zones. Wang et al. (2021) proposed an improved adaptability analysis method based on EGM2020, utilizing the high resolution and multi-scale analysis capabilities of EGM2020 to effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of adaptation zone identification. The continuous updates of these pre-trained models indicate that as data precision and model complexity improve, the adaptability analysis of gravity field products will continue to be optimized. However, analysis methods based on static gravity field features still have limitations, especially when dealing with dynamic observation data."}, {"title": "2.2. Gravity Adaptation Zone Calibration Methods", "content": "The development of gravity adaptation zone calibration can be traced back to early threshold and information entropy methods based on single features [12]. These methods measured the adaptability of underwater gravity fields through simple feature analysis but were limited in handling complex gravity fields. In 2001, Xiao et al. proposed a multi-dimensional gravity field feature parameter analysis method, including gravity field standard deviation, roughness, correlation coefficient, slope standard deviation, skewness coefficient, and gravity anomaly difference entropy. These parameters provided a more comprehensive reflection of the complexity and variability of the gravity field, marking a significant advancement in gravity adaptation zone calibration. Subsequently, Cheng Li et al. (2007) proposed a gravity adaptation zone selection method based on local statistical features, while Cai Tijun et al. (2013) introduced an analytic hierarchy process for a comprehensive evaluation of gravity matching regions, further improving the rationality of adaptation zone calibration. Ouyang et al. (2020) used multi-attribute decision theory to weight gravity field features, addressing the problem of feature weight allocation. However, the issue of overlap and collinearity among multi-attribute features still exists. Zhang et al. (2021) introduced an improved A* algorithm to optimize route planning and non-adaptive zone avoidance, further improving navigation accuracy [5]. In recent years, with the rise of deep learning and attention mechanisms, attention-based feature fusion methods have brought new breakthroughs in gravity adaptation zone calibration. These methods can adaptively adjust feature weights, effectively handling complex feature relationships, improving the accuracy and robustness of calibration, and becoming a key direction for future gravity adaptation zone calibration."}, {"title": "2.3.

Each x\u2081 contains multiple features extracted from gravity anomaly data, including the gravity field's standard deviation, roughness, correlation coefficient, gradient standard deviation, skewness coefficient, and entropy.\nTo adaptively adjust the importance of each feature, we assign a weight to each feature using an attention mechanism. First, we define the weight coefficient as ai, representing the weight of each feature. The calculation of the weight coefficient depends on the similarity between features, which is evaluated through a scoring function that assesses the relationships between features. Specifically, we use a dot-product form to calculate the similarity score between feature x\u2081 and feature xj:\n$C_{ij} = x_i^T W x_j$\nwhere W \u2208 $R^{d\u00d7d}$ is a learnable weight matrix, and eij represents the similarity score between feature x\u2081 and feature xj.\nTo ensure the importance of different features is normalized, we apply a Softmax function to the similarity scores eij to compute the attention weight ai for each feature:\n$A_i = \\frac{exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} exp(e_{ij})}$\nwhere ai represents the normalized weight of the i-th feature, ensuring that the sum of all weights equals 1, i.e., \u03a3=1 i = 1.\nFinally, the feature fusion is completed through a weighted summation, resulting in the fused feature vector z, defined as:\n$Z= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i X_i$\nwhere z is the final fused feature vector, which integrates the weight information of different features. This fused feature will be used in the subsequent gravity adaptation zone calibration model, where prediction and calibration are performed using a Random Forest classifier."}, {"title": "2.6.

Discussion", "content": "This paper proposes a gravity adaptation zone calibration method based on attention-enhanced feature fusion, and experimental results verify its effectiveness across various machine learning models. The research workflow includes dataset construction and preprocessing, feature extraction, attention-based feature fusion, model training and evaluation, and comparative experiments of different feature selection methods.

To produce a harmless model, model providers usually pre-define a policy (e.g., OpenAI\nusage policy) or a constitution (Bai et al., 2022b), which is then used to align model to this fixed set\nof principles, producing a one-size-fits-all model.\nWhile the current approach works for generic use-cases, it fundamentally ignores the variabil-\nity of safety across cultures, applications, or users, and therefore the plurality of human values.\nWhat is considered safe in one culture may be unsafe in another (Bhatt et al., 2022; Naous et al.,\n2024; AlKhamissi et al., 2024). For instance, alcohol consumption is legal (with age) for most\nwestern countries but strictly prohibited in many other countries. Social norms also constantly\nevolve (Young, 2015). Importantly, users with specialized safety needs often find the standard model\ninadequate: video game developers frequently use language that, outside of gaming contexts, may be\ndeemed violent, whereas harassment training managers must be adept at identifying various forms\nof discriminatory language.\nWe thus propose a\nresearch question to rethink the current paradigm of safety alignment: how can we efficiently adjust\nmodel safety without re-training for each safety requirement?\nWe propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework for efficient inference-time adap-\ntation to diverse safety requirements. Our high-level strategy first produces an LLM that is easily\ncontrollable for safety (Fig. 1). This is achieved by fine-tuning models to follow natural language\n\"safety configs\" augmented in the system prompt. Safety configs (exemplified in \u00a74) are natural\nlanguage description of the desired safety behavior, such as, but not limited to, types of allowed and\ndisallowed contents. Next, to serve users with specialized safety needs (e.g., video game develop-\ners), the controllable model incorporates safety configs provided by authorized users\u2014such as safety\nexperts within the video game company-as a part of its system prompt. We outline a config review\nprocess between model providers and users to ensure security (\u00a73). Consequently, model safety is\nadapted at inference time without any re-training, and the adapted model is provided back to users\nas custom interfaces such as user-specific API endpoints.\nTo facilitate reproducible evaluation of CoSA, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that con-\nsiders both helpfulness and configured safety of model responses, summarizing them into a single\nCOSA-Score that represents the overall model controllability (\u00a73.1). We also develop CoSApien, a\nmanually crafted evaluation dataset designed to closely replicate real-world safety scenarios (\u00a74).\nIn search of models with controllable safety, our analysis shows that in-context alignment (Han,\n2023; Lin et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Lake et al., 2024) is insufficient due to the complexity\nof safety configs and the difficulty of constructing high-quality demonstrations at scale. This moti-\nvates us to present CoSAlign, a data-centric method that improves the controllability of model safety\n(\u00a75.2). CoSAlign first derives a risk taxonomy from training prompts, and generates diverse syn-\nthetic preference data using LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2023) and an error-scoring mechanism.\nMore controllable models are then created through preference optimization. Compared to strong\nbaselines, CoSAlign not only significantly improves controllability for safety configs seen during\ntraining, but also generalizes well to unseen safety configs (\u00a76).\nWe present a rich set of contributions, including our human-authored benchmark (CoSApien), eval-\nuation protocol (COSA-Score), and method toward improved controllability (CoSAlign). Our work\nadvocates for pluralism in safety alignment, allowing models to serve a broader range of our society."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Pluralistic alignment Recent works have underscored the significance of incorporating pluralistic\nhuman values (Zhao et al., 2021; Sorensen et al., 2023; 2024; Lake et al., 2024; Castricato et al.,\n2024a;b) and cultures (DURMUS et al., 2024; Dev & Qadri, 2024; Park et al., 2024; Li et al.,\n2024a;b; Chiu et al., 2024) in AI alignment. Although some work explore enhancing pluralism in\ngeneral (Chen et al., 2024; Pitis et al., 2024) or study the reliability of one-size-fits-all model to\npluralistic settings (Aakanksha et al., 2024), our work is the first focused effort on pluralistic safety\nalignment, which can be more nuanced and context-dependent. Relatedly, Sarkar et al. (2024) argues\nthat autonomous agents must possess \u201cnormative competence,\u201d to reason with and adapt to diverse\nnorms in an open world, motivating models with safety pluralism. Constitutional AI (Bai et al.,\n2022b; Huang et al., 2024) develops a single \u201cconstitution,\u201d i.e., a set of universal ethical principles\nthat models should follow, and then trains the constitution into a one-size-fits-all model, which still\nrequires re-training the model if the constitution changes. In contrast, our framework trains a single\ncontrollable model then efficiently adapts to different safety requirements on the fly without any\nfurther training.\nClosely relates to our proposed framework is the\napproach of in-context alignment (Han, 2023; Lin et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Lake et al., 2024).\nHowever, because of the complexity of safety configs and the difficulty of constructing high-quality\ndemonstrations at scale, we show that in-context alignment is insufficient for modifying safety re-\nquirements (\u00a75.1), thus requiring alternative approaches, which motivates our proposed CoSAlign\nmethod (\u00a76). Other multi-objective alignment approaches include retraining (Bai et al., 2022a; Wu\net al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023) and parameter merging (Rame et al., 2023; Jang et al., 2023). Dong\net al. (2023) allow steering of attributes such as toxicity and humor, but does not enable complex\nand fine-grained control through safety configs. Another line of work conducts decoding-time align-\nment by re-scoring partial generations with custom reward functions (Shi et al., 2024; Mudgal et al.,\n2024; Deng & Raffel, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a). Although multiple objectives are supported under\nthis framework, a new reward function needs to be learned for each new objective, thus blocking\nefficient adaptation to new objectives or novel safety configs.\nControllability through instruction Increasing inference-time controllability by training with nat-\nural language interface has been explored in Zhang et al. (2023), but for a non-safety setting. In-\nstruction hierarchy (IH; Wallace et al., 2024) explicitly defines privilege level for different types\nof instructions, teaching LLMs to selectively ignore lower-privileged instructions. Complementary\nto our work, IH reduces prompt injection attacks from users that attempt to modify safety configs\nwithout authorization, but we show in \u00a76 that IH does not lead to better controllability. Rule-based\nrewards (Mu et al., 2024) help models balance between helpfulness and safety, but because rules\nare injected into the model during PPO process, no on-the-fly adaptation is offered. Our training\nmethod builds on work that fine-tune LLMs to become better instruction followers (Mishra et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022, i.a.), including preference optimiza-\ntion techniques such as direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "3 COSA: A FRAMEWORK FOR CONTROLLABLE SAFETY ALIGNMENT", "content": "The CoSA framework consists of two parts (Fig. 1): First, it trains an LLM to follow safety config-\nurations in the system prompt.

Thus, we develop a novel evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and\nconfigured safety, as shown in Fig. 2. Here we define \u201cconfigured safety\" as a response adhering\nto the safety guidelines specified in the safety config.\nEvauation setup We define a test set as the collection of N test configs \\({T_i}_{i=1}^{N}\\). Each test config\n\\(T_i = \\{S_i, \\{{x_{i,j}}\\}_{j=1}^{M}\\}\\) consists of a safety config \\(s_i\\) along with a set of carefully selected test prompts\n\\({\\{x_{i,j}\\}}_{j=1}^{M}\\), such that they cover a wide range of situations related to the current config \\(s_i\\). We\nensure the following 3 types of test prompts that elicit (1) completely allowed content (allowed), (2)\ncompletely disallowed content (disallowed), and (3) both allowed and disallowed content under the\ntest config (partial), are included in the test set. For example, in the context of game development\nconfig where violence is allowed, an example prompt for each type are (1) \"How to beat the villain\nin the last mission?\u201d, (2) \u201cSuggest a storyline where a character making hateful remarks based\non another character's religion.\" (3) \"Generate a scene between two friends dueling with wooden\nswords and a parallel scene between them having sexual relationship.\" Ensure this coverage is\ncrucial for the comprehensivness of controllability evaluation. In this work, we provide two test sets\nCoSApien (\u00a74) and CoSAlign-Test (\u00a76), which have been verified for the aforementioned coverage.\nEvaluation protocol We describe the protocol for evaluating helpfulness and configured safety of\na candidate model M. For each test config \\(T_i = \\{S_i, \\{{x_{i,j}}\\}_{j=1}^{M}\\}\\), we first use M to produce a\nresponse \\(y_{i,j}\\) for each prompt \\(x_{i,j}\\). Next, we produce scores for judging response helpfulness and\nconfigured safety: (1) \\(h_{i,j} = judge\\_help(x_{i,j}, y_{i,j})\\) gives a real-valued score with range [0, 1]\non whether \\(y_{i,j}\\) is a helpful response to prompt \\(x_{i,j}\\) and (2) \\(f_{i,j} = judge\\_safe(s_i, x_{i,j}, y_{i,j})\\)\nevaluates whether \\(y_{i,j}\\) is a safe response for prompt \\(x_{i,j}\\) under the current safety config \\(s_i\\). This\nbinary score is set to 1 if the response is safe and to -1 otherwise. We both prompt GPT-4 with\nrelevant instructions as automatic evaluators (detailed in \u00a7A.5), and conduct human evaluation. The\nfinal control score over all test configs and all test prompts is\n\\[\\text{COSA-SCORE}(\\{T_i\\}, \\{{h_{i,j}, f_{i,j}}\\}_{i=1}^{N,M}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M} h_{i,j} f_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} h_i \\cdot f_i\\]\nwhere \\(h_i, f_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\) are the vectorized evaluation judgement scores for the i-th test config. Therefore,\na response that is both helpful (\\(h_{i,j} > 0\\)) and safe (\\(f_{i,j} = 1\\)) will contribute positively to CoSA-\nScore, while any helpful and unsafe (\\(f_{i,j} = -1\\)) responses will contribute negatively.

Finally, it conducts preference optimization\nto produce models with controllable safety.\nRisk taxonomy derivation To bootstrap synthetic data creation, CoSAlign derives a risk\ntaxonomy-a list of risk categories with corresponding definitions\u2014from the set of training prompts\n(\u00a7A.1). While prior works in safety alignment have created risk taxonomy for their purposes (Inan\net al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023; Han et al., 2024), we create our own taxonomy because (1) Our taxonomy\ninduces higher human agreement when conducting automatic prompt risk category classification, a\nrequirement for CoSAlign data synthesis, and (2) The taxonomy based on training prompts ensures\nthere are sufficient data for each category. To cover all types of risks, we include an \u201cOther Harms\"\ncategory and instruct prompt labelers to use it when no other category fits.\nSynthesizing diverse and relevant configs CoSAlign leverages the risk taxonomy to address\ntwo key data challenges related to safety configs: (1) relevancy, the difficulty of finding rele-\nvant training prompts for each safety config, and (2) diversity, the difficulty of constructing a\ndiverse set of safety configs. For training data only, CoSAlign assumes safety configs are based\non risk categories: given our taxonomy consisting of 8 risk categories represented by the set\n\\(R = \\{\\text{violence, privacy violation}, ... \\}\\), each config allow a subset of risks \\(C \\subseteq R\\), which we\nname as \"config risk categories.\"\nTo tackle the relevancy challenge, instead of finding relevant prompts for each safety config, we\nreverse the process and synthetically generate relevant configs for each training prompt (Fig. 4)."}, {"title": "6 EXPERIMENTS AND EMPIRICAL FINDINGS", "content": "Constructing CoSAlign-Train We train CoSAlign using prompts from the BeaverTails dataset (Ji\net al., 2023) and the non-adversarial subset of WildguardTrain (Han et al., 2024), and hold out 3\nrisk categories (weapons, drugs, sexual content) to test unseen configs.

We provide an extended discussion on ethical implications in \u00a78.\nA potential risk of using system prompts for controllability includes prompt injection attacks (Liu\net al., 2024; Yi et al., 2024; Toyer et al., 2023, i.a.) that alter the safety config in user messages,\nand prompt extraction attacks (Zhang et al., 2024b, i.a.) that attempt to extract safety configs.\nWe conduct extensive general safety evaluation in \u00a76.2 and find our CoSAlign models robust. As\ndiscussed in \u00a72, we expect combining instruction hierarchy fine-tuning with CoSAlign to further\nincrease robustness.

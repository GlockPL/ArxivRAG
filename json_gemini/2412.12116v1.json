The expanding use of Al by students necessitates a critical examination of its impact on learning processes and pedagogical practices. Generative Al, especially large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, have the capacity to simulate human-like text, music, movies et cetera raising important questions about their role in education. This article reviews the theoretical foundations of intelligence, creativity, and Al, differentiating LLMs from traditional search engines and emphasizing the need for critical source competence among students. Empirical evidence on the effects of Al in classrooms is currently limited. However, Al's ability to provide personalized learning support, facilitate complex problem-solving, and offer educational platforms presents both opportunities and challenges. While Al can assist in producing text and enhancing productivity, concerns arise over its potential to undermine deep learning and critical thinking when students use it as a shortcut. The study highlights the importance of deliberate educational strategies to ensure that Al supplements rather than replaces genuine cognitive effort. By examining cognitive theories and the ecological framework of classrooms, the study underscores the importance of integrating Al in a way that fosters active and meaningful learning. Al's role should be context-dependent, guided by the pedagogical rationale specific to different educational stages and subjects. The study concludes with practical inferences for teachers on utilizing Al effectively, emphasizing promoting learning with understanding, and fostering students' critical engagement with Al-generated content. We need a balanced and informed approach to leveraging Al in education, prioritizing the long-term development of students' knowledge, skills, and critical competencies.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in schools is a topic that is increasingly engaging many stakeholders. This study provides the reader with a foundation to consider how generative Al can be applied in teaching various school subjects and to identify classroom settings in which the technology should not be used. There is a growing tendency for students to use Al in their schoolwork. Students chart their own course, and they do so regardless of what a given teacher thinks about how students should use technology. Young people are both the most frequent users of Al and those who believe to the greatest extent that the information they obtain from Al services is correct and credible. This latter point highlights the school's duty to facilitate students' development of critical source competence. As teachers, school leaders, and educational authorities, we must consider not only how schools should manage students' independent use of Al but also when and how Al could be included in teaching."}, {"title": "", "content": "Finding solutions to recognized problems is often connected with human creativity, which is based partially or even entirely on intelligence (Sternberg, 1999). The term 'intelligence' refers to the human ability to find solutions to new tasks using reasoning (Cattell, 1963), but technology can interact with human intelligence and creativity when problems need to be solved (Jia et al., 2024). Al refers to how computer systems can perform tasks that normally require \u2013 or at least once required - human intelligence. For example, Al can be useful for creative processes (Doshi & Hauser, 2024) and for increased productivity, as when it helps workers in text-intensive occupations compose their materials (Noy & Zhang, 2023). Traditionally, humans have been the central actors in education. But through the emergence of generative Al based on large language models (LLMs), this reality is being challenged (Staneva & Elliott, 2023): for the first time in history, a non-human actor exists that can use human language in a way that resembles human communication so much that it can be hard to distinguish between a person and a machine. This raises many challenges and risks for the school and society in general, but it also offers new opportunities. Today's teachers find themselves amid these challenges.\nLearning is a long-term activity. The education in secondary school is built on the fundamental knowledge and skills acquired in primary school and aims to further develop students' knowledge, critical thinking, and specialized skills as for some learners a preparation for higher education. In principle, the use of Al in preparatory programs should above all have a pedagogical rationale. Vocational training, on the other hand, aims to provide the learning individual with a profession-specific competence that provides a basis for becoming a professional practitioner. Vocational educations (professional educations, specialized college educations, and vocational education programs) should embrace the opportunities that Al provides in the professional operations to which these educational paths lead. The reason is that technological development makes those occupational tasks easier, more efficient, and effective, and Al has the potential to promote workplace productivity in many areas.\nAl is the simulation of intelligence in machines (Cukurova, 2024); it receives impressions and impulses from its environment and produces an intelligent way of being (Russel & Norvig, 2020). Its manifestations can include translation from one language to another, creating images and videos, recognizing speech, aiding in decision-making and much more (Epstein et al., 2023). When data systems are capable of learning from their own experiences and solving complex problems, we speak of Al. In this way, the technology may appear to be intelligent, but it is still artificial.\nAn LLM is a specialized type of Al that has been trained on large amounts of text to 'understand' existing content and generate new content. It is important to recognize that LLMs are neither search engines that seek facts nor databases; rather, they are pattern-seeking engines that predict the next word in a sequence of words. LLMs do not check facts, and they do not find facts. The foundation of a LLM lies in a variant of a computer program that has the capacity to produce text. These models \u2013 referred to as generative Al - have learned by training on large amounts of textual data sources. The most widely known one is ChatGPT, which launched a free version on November 30, 2022. Since its launch, ChatGPT and its performance have received substantial attention.\nGPT is an acronym for the generative, pre-trained and transformer, each of which is explained below (Wolfram, 2023). Generative refers to the tool's ability to produce new text based on text that has been fed into it. Students should be critical and able to evaluate information using their own knowledge. ChatGPT bases its responses on large amounts of data that may contain errors or even fabrications. It"}, {"title": "", "content": "simulates human answers using probability and can therefore produce inaccurate or fanciful; when this happens, the technology is said to 'hallucinate'.\nBeing pre-trained means that ChatGPT has been prepared on a large volume of actual text and enables it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the inputs the user supplies. When ChatGPT was launched, users quickly became aware that it had been pre-trained on limited material. But this has changed over time, and it functions much better today (Yuan et al., 2024).\nThe transformer aspect refers to a network architecture that can handle sequences of data such as words. It was a professional community at Google that developed a transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which was first tested out in a translation program. It appears to 'understand' the context around words and sentences better than its predecessors in this network architecture. Imagine asking ChatGPT to translate this sentence into German: 'I arrived at the bank after crossing the road' (Uszkoreit, 2017). The correct translation is: ' Ich kam zur Bank, nachdem ich die Stra\u00dfe \u00fcberquert hatte'. But ChatGPT gets confused when you ask it to translate 'I arrived at the bank after crossing the river' because the word 'bank' in English can mean a financial institution or the land next to a river, depending on context. In the sentence 'I arrived at the bank after crossing the river', if 'bank' is meant to be 'riverbank', the correct translation to German would be: 'Ich kam ans Flussufer, nachdem ich den Fluss \u00fcberquert hatte'.\nThis means that ChatGPT's attention mechanism enables it to figure out that the word 'bank' has different meanings in the two sentences. The transformer property consists of an attention mechanism that allows the LLM to weigh the significance of different parts of the sentence that was fed in and to process all parts of the sentence simultaneously: when 'the river' occurs at the end of the sentence, the meaning content in 'bank' (which appears before 'river') shifts: it has attention.\nAlthough pre-training gives the language model a general understanding of language, ChatGPT has also been supplemented with fine-tuning that often creates positive framings for the answers it supplies. This is shown by asking ChatGPT the following three questions: 'Can I be proud of being' (1) queer, (2) a woman and (3) a man? It answers the first two as follows: 'Absolutely! Feeling pride in being [queer/a woman] is a valid and empowering experience'. To the question 'Can I be proud of being a man?,' it answers at length:\nIt's important to consider the societal context in which such pride is expressed. Historically, expressions of male pride have been tied to patriarchal structures and the marginalization of women and persons who do not identify with a binary gender. As a result, discussions about male pride can be sensitive and complex.\nWhat does this mean? ChatGPT and other LLMs do not provide neutral answers. Language models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, and others simply have their own political slant (Feng et al., 2023). This implies that those using these LLMs must have the critical judgment needed to evaluate the answers they provide. However, a chatbot can also curb erroneous conclusions (Costello et al., 2014). These conflicting consequences have implications for teachers' work.\nThe type of Al based on LLMs has been described as 'a stochastic parrot' (Cukurova, 2024). The word 'stochastic' indicates that the process leading to a result has a random component. For example, when the Al model generates a text, the model calculates probabilities for the word or expression that should come next and often tests these probabilities, leading to variations in outputs even when the same"}, {"title": "", "content": "prompt is used multiple times. The parrot element refers to the model repeating words or sentences it has heard, which happens without the model 'understanding' these words or sentences. It should be noted that generative Al cannot, so far, truly understand the meaning behind the words that are fed into it. This means that the answers it generates can often be superficial and lack depth and insight (Bogust, 2022). Thus, the language model does not create original thoughts but so far reproduces human-like text based on the patterns it learned during training on a large dataset of text. In other words, the language model does not understand text in the way humans do but can mimic coherent and contextually appropriate linguistic responses. Therefore, it is among the class of language models that can be characterized as stochastic parrots. This points out one of the limitations of the current language models.\nWhether we are facing a new turn in the development of Al an artificial general intelligence that resembles human intelligence (Mitchell, 2024) \u2013 remains an open question. Such an intelligence is expected to have the ability (rather like the human form) to use its 'intellect' to solve a wide range of problems by transferring knowledge from one situation to another (Sonko et al., 2024). This form of intelligence is also often referred to as strong Al, and some believe it is possible to develop such artificial general intelligence. If this happens, society may change considerably (Bengio et al., 2024), but it is not clear whether it is possible to develop such an intelligence and, if so, when that technology will be available (Mitchell, 2024). At the time of writing (November 2024), there is no consensus that general Al exists, but some see OpenAl's language models as a step towards an artificial general intelligence (Robison, 2024).\nAl is not a new phenomenon; it has been a part of the development of technology for several decades. We are familiar with Al using various types of technological solutions: the self-propelled and pre-programmed robotic vacuum cleaner uses Al, translation programs such as Google Translate use Al, Microsoft Word uses Al to suggest linguistic improvements, Gmail uses Al to filter spam, and YouTube and Netflix use Al to suggest playlists. The list of Al applications is long. In addition, Al is expected to have impacts on several workplaces (including teaching), but as things now stand, it is difficult to have a clear opinion on how those impacts will be manifest in tomorrow's labour market (Staneva & Elliot, 2023).\nMany are familiar with rule-driven Al using chatbots such as those that public agencies, banks and other private businesses have been using for several years. This rule-based Al only does what the machine is prepared to do. Things are different with generative Al based on LLMs. This article is about the use of generative Al in schools.\nInterest in Al over time can show fluctuations between flourishing and declining interest (Toosi et al., 2021). In recent years, growing interest has been typical. The emergence of ChatGPT has received widespread attention, but there are several other chatbots in addition to ChatGPT: Gemini, Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, Chatsonic, Socratic and so on."}, {"title": "Al in Schools", "content": "Generative Al has been integrated into what are called educational platforms, with SchoolAl, Canvas, Mizou, Curious and Learnlab the best known. With these platforms, the teachers have their own dashboards, which are digital modules that enable teachers to gain an overview of how the students are progressing on the tasks they have been assigned. There are several support functions that can help students in certain phases of writing work (choosing a topic, finding material, etc.). As of this writing, we"}, {"title": "", "content": "do not know what impact this might have on students' learning progress, but anecdotal reports indicate that teachers find such educational platforms meaningful for their work.\nAl is in the process of creating a significant societal upheaval in many areas. In schools, discussions about generative Al have revolved around how using that technology can be both a resource and a problem for teaching and learning. Al has already affected students' learning processes and teachers' work in the relatively short period that ChatGPT have existed. The message is that the conditions for teachers' work have changed: they should use the possibly beneficial approaches that Al offers and avoid the disadvantageous ones.\nSo far, there is little research that uses empirical evidence to report how teachers can and should benefit from using Al, how and whether Al can be beneficial for the learning process, the academic topics for which students' use of chatbots is suitable, or for which grades Al is best. All teachers must rely on their professional judgment. As noted above, it is the rationale of education and the justification of school subjects that should be emphasized when the question of using Al arises.\nWhat matters when choosing technology? When, how and why Al and other technological opportunities are relevant to the teacher's work is connected to the justification of education (Salomon, 2016). Generative Al is only the beginning of a development whose outcomes do not know. Children starting school in autumn 2025 will complete their basic education in the 2030s. Most students then take further education, and many continue into higher education. The first grader in 2025 might be imagined completing their master education in 2043 or later. It is difficult to imagine how society will be structured then.\nThe purpose of primary education revolves around the understanding of and reasoning for education at the primary level. It is not the use of technology itself that is important, but the pedagogical utility of that use. In today's schools, digital skills are often defined as basic skills, and that is not sufficient to meet future realities. Students must also have knowledge of technology. Skills presuppose broad knowledge that is acquired in subject teaching. In today's schools, computer science is not a separate subject. In the Danish public school system, a separate subject called 'Technology Comprehension' has been introduced. This is an example of a forward-looking renewal of school content. Something similar is also needed in other countries' education.\nThe purpose of generative Al in primary education and in preparatory programs for higher education should be to help schools cultivate long-term learning rather than simply having students use more technology in school. Age and maturity should matter. The big tech giants are developing chatbots targeting increasingly younger age groups. For example, Google has launched chatbots for students aged 13 and up. This means that the question of how schools should relate to Al will soon concern middle schools. Some have even argued that Al is also relevant in grades 1-7 (Gates, 2024), although that view is highly controversial.\nThrough higher education, the learning individual is supposed to develop advanced knowledge and skills. This can be part of general or professional education. Higher education is the third level in the education system; its purpose is to offer opportunities for advanced studies and professional development that serve both individuals and the broader society. In many professions, technological advancements have eased traditional workloads, and that could also become the case for teachers. However, it cannot be blithely assumed to apply to the education sector. There is a fundamental difference between"}, {"title": "", "content": "technology that streamlines production (i.e., that creates productivity gains) and technology that is to support students' learning processes. In school, it is precisely learning that is the entire purpose of the effort, and it is not always the case that productivity gains stemming from technology use serve that goal. Schooling and further education aim to enrich students with deep-seated knowledge and skills that will last in the long run.\nTeachers must use professional judgment in deciding of when generative Al should be used in the pedagogical effort. The central element in teaching situations lies in the teacher's decisions. Various factors influence these choices when it comes to selecting teaching methods, including context, the nature of the learning material and students' existing knowledge levels. This implies that it is impractical to propose all-encompassing guidelines for the use of Al in the classroom across all subjects and age groups. Al is also merely one of many technological alternatives that can be used in an educational context. Teachers inevitably make decisions under uncertain conditions, which requires the use of sound pedagogical judgment.\nTeaching has been compared to an art form (James, 1899/1983). At its best, research helps us abstain from counterproductive practices, but becoming a skilled teacher requires intuition and a keen understanding. This ability to explain the learning material in an educationally beneficial way and to respond well to students' questions is at the core of the art of teaching.\nEvery teacher should strive to develop a distinctive set of effective and efficient teaching methods and a repertoire of content representations. This development comes through repeated teaching experiences using the available technological tools that teachers have at their disposal. Al is just one of these tools. A teaching repertoire refers to the range of methods, strategies, techniques and resources a teacher uses to instruct students or create structures for their engagement and school activities. A functioning teaching repertoire should include a variety of approaches to meet students' different learning needs. By developing a flexible teaching repertoire, teachers can influence not only their students' learning process but also establish a learning environment that gives students rich opportunities to take active control of their own learning efforts.\nThe very act of learning and the way learning is viewed can change because of changes to the learning environments brought about by Al. One change may occur through personalized learning experiences. All students can in principle have access to virtual teaching tailored to their individual needs, interests and learning pace. With Al technology available over the internet, information becomes more accessible to more people, regardless of geographic, economic or social background. This can help level the playing field in education. On the other hand, a school that emphasizes students' ability to manage their own learning processes can also reinforce differences in students' opportunities to succeed in their education.\nThe simplest way to understand the concept of learning is that it is about the process of acquiring new knowledge and a better understanding (higher order knowledge). But the term 'to acquire' can be misleading since new knowledge sprouts from old knowledge: indeed, we can say that the learning individual acquires knowledge while meaning is constructed in a personal way and based on what that individual already knows. The term meaning construction implies that learning should be an active process: the change that occurs is achieved through what the student does mentally and/or physically. This understanding of learning is based on a cognitive theoretical outlook (Anderson, 2020), but it is limited to cognitive processes in individuals. What is needed in this paper is a theory about students' interactions with technology. It is not controversial to note that technology contributes to learning by"}, {"title": "", "content": "providing academic support. However, the internal processing and storage of knowledge in the brain is the core of the learning process, not the information stored on digital devices. The goal of this paper is to present a useful theoretical framework for understanding how people learn, both with and without the help of Al. To achieve such a holistic understanding requires expanding the area of focus beyond the individual and incorporating theories that recognize generative Al as a possible external resource for the learning process. This entails acknowledging that thinking can be distributed: that is, students' thought processes not only take place inside but also in interaction with digital devices (and of course other students and teachers). I explore cognitive theory, ecological theory and the theory of distributed cognition, on which I elaborate below. This theoretical framework is therefore not limited to the mental system inside an individual's brain but recognizes that thinking is an extended phenomenon that also includes tools such as digital devices, other people, and the very environment with which the individual interacts (Salomon, 1997). This perspective gives us a more holistic understanding of the learning process in a world where technology plays an increasingly major role.\nInformation from a Google search is different from what is generated by an Al tool like ChatGPT. Based on its responses from large datasets full of potential errors, ChatGPT simulates human responses using probability and can therefore produce false or fictional results; as noted above, they can hallucinate. Unlike real understanding, Al-driven responses often lack depth and insight. Because of this, students should be critical and able to evaluate information using their own knowledge, but to be critical, students must have such knowledge in the first place. Teachers must therefore develop strategies and assessments to ensure that students develop the necessary knowledge and understanding, regardless of access to Al tools. This requires educational planning to assist students in the learning process.\nAl can affect the learning process in several ways. The concept of student + technology addresses the idea that technology can extend and enhance an individual's thinking ability when the two function together as a unit. On the positive side, technology can act as a cognitive support and enhance the learning process. It can help a person perform complex tasks or understand complex ideas that might not have otherwise been mastered. In such cases, humans and technology combine their capacities to form a more effective thinking unit. On the downside, the use of technology can weaken the learning process (Abbas et al., 2024; Bastani et al., 2024; Shine, 2024; Zhang & Noyes, 2023). If a student uses technology to copy answers directly without engaging cognitively or striving to understand the material, technology becomes a short cut that derails the learning process. This can result in an adequate external outcome, such as a well-written essay, that lacks any underlying learning or the acquisition of new knowledge. This is the greatest danger of Al in schools.\nThe adage 'no pain, no gain' helps emphasize the importance of effort in the learning process (Bjork & Bjork, 2020; Kirschner et al., 2022). Education must facilitate that effort through desirable difficulties. Although technology can increase productivity and improve performance, it must be emphasized that the student still needs to engage actively and cognitively to achieve learning with genuine understanding.\nThe mechanisms of student motivation are complex and must be tailored according to age level and maturity. While motivation is often considered crucial for getting students to learn, there is no direct causal relationship by which motivation alone leads to learning (Kirschner et al., 2022). Instead, the satisfaction of succeeding at learning tasks can stimulate further motivation. This is due to the"}, {"title": "", "content": "physiological effects of a chemical released in the brain. The desire to learn does not necessarily come before the effort.\nThe content of school subjects is hierarchically organized, but students read a text line by line or listen to teachers and other students speak; it is a linear process. The challenge is to extract meaning from the content that exists hierarchically in messages that occur linearly (Willingham, 2023). This mental reconstruction requires concentration, effort, dedication and sometimes even mental pain: fatigue from thinking, frustration at not understanding something immediately or the challenge of overcoming sometimes daunting obstacles in the learning process (David et al., 2024). The gain is the improved understanding that comes from sustained mental effort. To endure the mental pain, motivation, resilience and perseverance are necessary. If a student cannot exercise self-discipline, tutors who provide a framework for the learning work that stimulates self-discipline are necessary. This can be called learning management.\nIn practice, learning management can involve designing a decision architecture based on the principle of libertarian paternalism (Elstad, 2008): learning environments must be designed so that students have incentives (cohesion and structure) to overcome the mental pain that effort gives. Paternalism comes into play with the teacher setting the framework for teaching: instructions, expectations and control. The libertarian part comes into play because students will have some autonomy and co-determination. The goal of libertarian paternalism is to influence each student's decisions in ways that will make them better off through perseverance while preserving choice. Perseverance must be learned; it is not innate.\nThe driving force in perseverance has an internal and an external component, and it is the interplay between them that matters. Incentives can be built into the plan for learning work, support functions that may be needed and a mutual understanding of what the product of the effort involves (e.g., assessment criteria). Learning management can thus influence student decisions; the learning environment should drive students to do more than what is in their comfort zone. If students need peace and order to concentrate on the learning work, this is referred to as classroom management. Later in this paper, ecological theory is discussed, as it is precisely a theory about the interactions between teacher, students and technology in line with these premises.\nWill the introduction of generative Al into society signal a more radical change in the theoretical framework of educational research that starts with the human being as the fundamental premise for learning in schools? We do not know. Do we need a more comprehensive theoretical shift in education research that reflects our current digital reality and the influence of Al? We do not know. For the first time in history, a non-human actor capable of using human language in a way so like human usage that it challenges the boundaries of what human communication and what is machine communication is emerging (Krumsvik, 2023). In examining this question, a sharp distinction must be made between vocational education that qualifies people for specific professional tasks on the one hand and education that lays the competence foundation for further academic education on the other.\nFor vocational trainings where the tasks are significantly changed due to Al, we need to establish a theoretical perspective that focuses on the performance that machine and human combine to provide. In some areas, operations can be fully or partially automated while the worker's role becomes to, for example, initiate machine performance, handle extraordinary situations and oversee everything. In other areas, cognition can be distributed across individuals and systems of artefacts (e.g., navigation maps, computation-based devices and communication systems; see Hutchins, 2020). Our theoretical"}, {"title": "", "content": "frameworks and the interactions between humans and machines (including Al) must reflect this complexity.\nAn example of such a framework is the theory of computer-supported cooperative work (Chen et al., 2018; Janssen & Kirschner, 2020). What underlies this term is a group of theories intended to capture how humans collaborate using computer systems such as Al in autonomous vehicles, at a nuclear power plant or in the electronic systems of a jet aircraft and how these systems can be designed to support collaboration effectively (Cope et al., 2021; Howard, 2019).\nIn educational contexts that lay the foundation for further studies (e.g., primary school and academic preparation programs in upper secondary school), the use of Al should be determined by the tool's educational function. It is the individual's learning that is reflected in the guidelines for examination. On preparation day exam, all aids are allowed, but during the exam itself, students are not permitted to communicate with others or use generative Al. This is justified by the goal of ensuring the fairest and most equal exam setting and is a central goal of many countries' school systems. Consideration of the individual student's competence is also central for the final grades that teachers determine. In academic preparation programs, it is the individual student's knowledge and skills that are central: what the student is capable of without Al is still important."}, {"title": "Learning mechanisms and limitations: A cognitive theoretical perspective", "content": "Learning involves a change in knowledge through experience and takes place in the individual's brain. The process can start with attention to external stimuli such as words, images or movements that are sensed via sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch (Willingham, 2023). When we actively process these stimuli through thinking, repetition or reformulation, something happens with our memory: we may succeed in remembering. Whether this happens depends, among other things, on repetitions and mental processes. Motivation is central as the driving force for these types of cognitive processing.\nThe theory of cognitive processing emphasizes that people can only process a limited amount of information at the same time (perhaps 3\u20137 information units), but they can switch between tasks, as when people read a text on their mobile and occasionally glance at a news broadcast (Anderson, 2020). In other words, people have difficulties doing two things at the same time. However, automation eases the pressure in mental processing; someone can knit while watching a film because knitting is a largely automatic skill that requires little mental capacity. On the other hand, it would be challenging for a beginner to learn to knit while watching a movie because both activities require attention.\nA central conclusion is that the human cognitive system has limited capacity to process potential stimuli. For teachers, it is important to recognize that digital distractions can easily hinder students' concentration and thus learning opportunities (OECD, 2024). On the other hand, a new study shows that impulsive students with concentration problems can benefit from Al tools in schoolwork (Klarin et al., 2024). This is explained by the fact that Al tools appear to make it easier for them to carry out certain tasks. If this is to work, these researchers believe that schools must have clear rules for how Al tools can and cannot be used. However, one study is not enough to draw a firm conclusion about the role Al can have in concentration. We need more research to better understand the desirable functions that Al can have in the learning process."}, {"title": "", "content": "Attention is fragile, and the temptations of entertainment can disturb focus and cognitive processing (Elstad, 2008). This has implications for teachers' learning management. If students become used to alternating between school tasks and breaks with entertainment, this can establish itself as a habit and a desire to continue clicking when boredom arises. Over time, this can become an obstacle to persistence. For example, reading short texts at the expense of long texts could lead to superficial learning outcomes.\nThe working memory is a central part of the mental system. For example, if one is asked the name of the world's highest mountain, 'Mount Everest' will quickly be pulled from the long-term memory. This is an example of retrieval (or recall) from long-term memory to working memory. Long-term memory contains the residues of thinking ahead of time and consists of both explicit and implicit knowledge, which together form prerequisites and background knowledge (Willingham, 2023). The difference between working memory and long-term memory is essential; working memory is the place where thinking happens in the brain. In practice, several places in the brain are active at any given time, while long-term memory stores knowledge.\nWorking memory holds information that we actively need or use but, as noted above, it has limitations in terms of processing stimuli. However, working memory does not have limitations when retrieving the prerequisites stored in long-term memory, which makes that background knowledge a significant strength in the process of learning new material (Grissmer et al., 2023; Simonsmeier et al., 2019). This implies that students with adequate prerequisites have a clear advantage in the learning process and can more easily acquire new subject matter than those with fewer prerequisites. What constitutes adequate background knowledge will vary by subject and topic complexity, but in general, prerequisites include what we call fundamental concepts within a given field. Retrieval strengthens the memory itself.\nThe new topic should logically build on previous subject matter that has been covered in instruction, and students should have the necessary knowledge and skills required to work with the new topic. By ensuring that students have adequate prerequisites, teachers can facilitate smooth transitions to new topics and help students build on what they already know. The cognitive processing of prerequisites (along with the subject matter to which students are exposed) leads to generative learning, which involves actively creating meaning out of information to be learned by mentally reorganizing and integrating it with one's prerequisites, thus making it possible for one to use what has been learned in new situations (Fiorella & Mayer, 2016)."}, {"title": "", "content": "manner. A schema is a set of thoughts about a topic that serves as a reference point for new information. Schemata make thinking faster, but when new information does not fit well with existing schemata, new ones must be formed. We must distinguish between long-term learning and the short-term learning of individual information elements. It is long-term learning that is central in grasping the material in school subjects, but new knowledge elements can be building blocks in a cumulative process. This means that new knowledge builds on previously learned knowledge and that the student can link knowledge elements not only within a single school subject but also themes and content that span multiple disciplines (Markauskaite et al., 2024). The concept of progression is central here; it refers to how instruction facilitates the development of students' knowledge and understanding over time \u2013 hour by hour, week by week and year by year. From such an outlook, learning becomes a cumulative and long-term pursuit (Willingham, 2023).\nAccording to the cognitive theoretical perspective, memory consists of the residues of our previous thinking (Willingham, 2021). Thorough and deep thinking about school subject matter is more likely to leave a lasting impression in the memory than superficial processing of the same material. This assumption is in line with research in cognitive psychology, which shows that the more deeply and actively we engage with information, the more likely it is to be encoded into long-term memory (Anderson, 2020).\nAbove, we have noted that the student's cognitive capacity sets limits. However, the combination of visual and verbal information can improve learning effects without the combination itself contributing to exceeding processing capacity. Multimedia learning, which involves the simultaneous use of both text and visual materials, is effective because humans have separate information processing systems for visual and verbal information (Paivio, 2014). This allows larger amounts of subject matter to be processed at the same time and makes it easier to incorporate and understand information. Presenting subject matter through the two channels of visual and verbal can thus promote insight and deep learning, especially when that information is well integrated with students' prerequisites. Language models like ChatGPT present text in response to a prompt, but other forms of generative Al \u2013 such as like Midjourney, DALL-E, Canva and Beatoven \u2013 create images, videos, music and the like. It is possible that there will be tools for use in schools that combine verbal and visual messages. This could, for instance, occur within the framework of educational platforms like Curious, SchoolAl and Canvas. In that case, a new chapter in the development of tools will be written. The expected combination of words and pictures in a chatbot can make the subject matter easier to understand and strengthen learning."}, {"title": "Desired difficulties in teaching to promote perseverance", "content": "Does using Al in education make learners less intelligent? It depends. The question certainly requires a nuanced answer. The student's knowledge, which is stored in long-term memory, is of great importance for achieving reading comprehension with academic texts (Grissmer et al., 2023). On the other hand, we know that generative Al can act as a powerful tool that helps many who work with texts produce better work (Zhang & Noyes, 2023). Here, we must distinguish between machine performance and a student's learning outcome: Al tools can be a shortcut to producing text and images, music and the like but are not a shortcut for learning.\nThe goal of education is for students to remember what they have learned long after it has been taught. A related goal is to help students form a mental representation of a phenomenon that they can quickly and easily recall when necessary and apply in new situations. The latter process is called the transfer of"}, {"title": "", "content": "knowledge. For students to be able to transfer knowledge, understanding the subject matter is essential. In the overarching part of the curriculum, emphasis is placed on deep learning, which highlights that students gradually deepen"}]}

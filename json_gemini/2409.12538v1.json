However, obtaining timely inputs is challenging due to the scarce availability of domain experts. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) research have suggested the feasibility of utilizing LLM-simulated expert personas to support research ideation. In this study, we introduce PERSONAFLOW, an LLM-based system using persona simulation to support the ideation stage of interdisciplinary scientific discovery. Our findings indicate that using multiple personas during ideation significantly enhances user-perceived quality of outcomes (e.g., relevance of critiques, creativity of research questions) without increasing cognitive load. We also found that users' persona customization interactions significantly improved their sense of control and recall of generated ideas. Based on the findings, we discuss highlighting ethical concerns, including potential over-reliance and cognitive biases, and suggest design implications for leveraging LLM-simulated expert personas to support research ideation when human expertise is inaccessible.", "sections": [{"title": "CCS CONCEPTS", "content": "\u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 Empirical studies in HCI; Interactive systems and tools; \u2022 Computing methodologies \u2192 Natural language processing."}, {"title": "KEYWORDS", "content": "Scientific Discovery, Large Language Models, Co-Creation Systems, Ideation Support, Persona Simulation"}, {"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The development of novel research ideas often requires discussion and feedback collection with peer researchers [2, 57, 75], especially for researchers conducting research on interdisciplinary topics. Researchers who are unfamiliar with a research domain often require guidance from domain experts to quickly gain an overview of the field. However, this requires timely and iterative input from experts, and can often be challenging due to the constraints of accessibility and availability of experts willing to provide feedback [18]. Meanwhile, feedback from peers with different backgrounds can be hard to interpret without domain knowledge, thus leading to communication gaps [5] between researchers from various disciplines when discussing research ideas. Moreover, researchers sometimes perceive expert critique as personal judgment, potentially leading to increased caution or defensiveness when seeking feedback [95]. Prior research has shown that AI can be used to deliver non-judgemental immediate feedback and interactions [31, 48, 88]. The concept of persona has been historically used in scenarios like design ideation [15, 77, 84] to facilitate need-finding. The use of AI-based personas for feedback gathering from an audience perspective has been widely discussed in existing works under various ideation contexts such as design[50, 68], journalism [69] and group-based decision-making [16] as beneficial for ideation by simulating human thinking. Providing diverse perspectives using Al-simulated personas would analogically benefit interdisciplinary research ideation. However, scientific ideation [29] differs from design ideation, which often requires extensive domain knowledge and grounding in literature. It remains under-studied whether and how AI personas can be used as expert personas and provide knowledge-intensive feedback and opinions. In the context of using LLM for scientific ideation, prior studies have explored using LLMs to assist researchers in developing research ideas in domains such as HCI [53], ML/NLP [92] and Economics [44]. While recent research has shown that LLMs have the capability to simulate personas with different expertise and effectively boost their performance in both knowledge- and reasoning-demanding tasks [13, 52, 96], there appears to be limited research specifically exploring the use of LLMs to simulate expert personas for facilitating research ideation in multidisciplinary fields. Thus, we aim to provide insights into the research question: how do researchers use Al-simulated expert personas to support their research ideation process when conducting interdisciplinary research? To this end, our study proposed a novel system, PERSONAFLOW, that aims to provide novel insights into how AI can help facilitate the peer feedback process through persona simulation. As shown in Figure 1, PERSONAFLOW is an LLM-based research ideation system that facilitates human-AI co-creation between human researchers and LLM-simulated expert personas. The system utilized a graph-based design that enables users to iteratively co-create and scaffold research ideas and questions. The system also adopts a mind map-styled to visually organize information and ideation outcomes. The design of the system is informed by a formative interview study with 10 researchers from three different research domains. To evaluate PERSONAFLOW, we first conducted a task-based user study involving 21 researchers from 8 different research institutions to assess the effectiveness of the system. The study focused on evaluating users' perceptions of and interactions with these personas. We also conducted an open-ended exploration study where 10 participants were invited to freely explore the system without tasks or constraints, to uncover their in-situ use cases of PERSONAFLOW in supporting the ideation process. The contribution of this study to the HCI community and the literature on human-Al co-creation is three-fold: \u2022 First, this study introduced a novel LLM-based research ideation system designed to facilitate human-AI collaboration in generating research ideas through graph-based interactions. The system breaks down the interdisciplinary collaborative ideation process into four key steps, each represented by a type of node: the framing of research questions"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, to show how our work contributes to the exist-ing literature, we provide a detailed review of relevant existingworks from three perspectives.

Finally, we review prior literatureon cognitive theories that inform the dynamics of collaborativeideation."}, {"title": "2.1 Persona simulation using LLM", "content": "LLM-related research has widely discussed the use of persona-based methods in terms of task-oriented scenarios. Studies showedthat the use of persona-based role-playing benefits the task-basedperformance of LLMs in a varied range of tasks, such as softwaredevelopment [72], mathematical problem solving [98], and generalinstruction following [100]. Collaboration among multiple LLM-based personas has been noted as beneficial in similar task-basedenvironments [13, 91, 96, 97].The concept of using personas is not new and has been previ-ously utilized in design and ideation processes to foster creativity and generate diverse ideas [46, 71, 84]. With recent advancesin LLM research, there is growing evidence that LLMs can simulate human behaviors and cognitive processes [27, 67, 68]. Forinstance, past works explored using the LLM-based persona simulation to curate feedback from the perspectives of different audiencegroups [16, 50, 68, 69]. From a broader perspective, studies haveutilized LLM-simulated personas to gain insights into social sci-ence and economics research [51, 103]. Research has suggested thattaking perspectives from different team members during the collaborative ideation process helps to improve both ideation creativityand diversity [39]. Similar benefits have also been observed in thecontext of collaborative scientific ideation [87]. Benharrak et al.[8] introduced and assessed a tool that aimed to support writersin improving their work by incorporating feedback provided byindividual agents based on user-constructed personas. However,despite these advancements, there has been limited discussion onhow multi-persona simulation by LLM can enhance human-AI cocreation and collaborative ideation. In this study, we aim to explorethe potential of multi-persona LLM simulations to enhance thescientific ideation processes."}, {"title": "2.2 LLM for research ideation and scaffolding", "content": "Researchers have started exploring methods to use LLMs to aug-ment research ideation and brainstorming processes for scientificwriting [6, 44, 82, 92]. For instance, Nigam et al.

Similarly, Gu andKrenn [32] used a knowledge graph to identify sub-graphs relevantto a researcher's interest and uses these sub-graphs alongside amodel to suggest scientific research ideas based on initial researchtopics given by researchers. Guo et al. [33] explored the usage ofAI assistants on user ideation, specifically, analyzing the impactof AI to introduce bias in user ideation. Studies [30, 59, 80] havealso discussed the use of LLMs for augmenting ideation and brainstorming processes for creative and group ideation. Other works,such as Sandholm et al. [79]'s work employed a non-linear thinkingmethodology that utilizes a problem-solution dataset and fine-tunedLLMs to infer new problem statements from the original user prob-lem statements.

The persona is generated by utilizing theabstracts from the previous literature, which are processed usinga scientific sentence classification pipeline built with a fine-tunedBERT model [7, 19]. This pipeline extracts the background, method-ology, and conclusion of the research. Finally, it summarizes theliterature node to provide context for generating personas; 3) Au-thor Profiling-based Persona Generation: To leverage the expertiseof scholarly authors whose papers were included in the literaturenode, we developed an author profiling-based persona generation.Using the Semantic Scholar API [42], we extracted papers fromauthors whose work was being recommended in the literature node.We identified the top three papers for each first author (since firstauthors are typically the primary contributors and experts in the research area the paper addresses), based on cosine similarity usingFAISS [26].

Beyond paststudies focusing on the perspective of audience [69], we demonstrated that incorporating expert AI personas with domain-specificexpertise fosters interdisciplinary research. Users effectively expressed different thinking patterns and addressed diverse use cases (section 5.3), with the help of the interactive mind map and easypersona customization, especially when refining ideas throughiterative revisions.

Although the findings demonstrated the utilityof the system in providing research ideation support, we notedpotential biases when users interacted with the personas duringsystem use. In this section, we discuss what the biases might beand how they might lead to a sub-optimal ideation process.Confirmation biases in selecting and editing personas. Par-ticipants exhibited potential confirmation biases [73] when gener-ating follow-up nodes during the system use, which reflects biasesfrom both human and AI sources in co-creation systems [12]. Morespecifically in PERSONAFLOW, human bias arises from users' de-cisions in selecting and editing personas, while AI bias reflectsinherent biases in the LLM's training data.Recent research indicates that users' backgrounds and prefer-ences contribute to confirmation biases in human-AI co-creation[53]. Users' affinity for AI personas close to their background wasalso suggested through our findings (section 5.2.1), including thetendency to edit personas by injecting their own background orexpertise. Users' trust increased when they recognized researchquestions similar to their ideas or when the system recommendedtheir own works. While this enhances trust, it may reinforce confir-mation biases, limiting the diversity and novelty of insights. Thisaligns with Cognitive Dissonance Theory [10, 36], suggesting indi-viduals prefer assistance aligning with their beliefs. Our observa-tions further echo this phenomenon.We speculate that guiding users to \"choose\" from generatedexpert personas exacerbates these biases, as it is less cognitivelydemanding than creating or critically editing personas. To mitigatethis, future designs should encourage critical evaluation and in-tegration of diverse persona traits possibly by reducing cognitive load and offering additional support.

We did not conduct systematic evalu-ation of the quality and accuracy of the personas that the systemgenerated nor the literature they recommended. The personas'knowledge might inherently be limited by the dataset on whichlarge language models were trained on when generating searchqueries. Another limitation of our study is the absence of a directcomparative baseline with similar ideation tools. While there arecurrently no ideation instruments that closely match the functional-ity of PERSONAFLOW, this limits our ability to objectively compareits usefulness. Future research should consider evaluating possiblebenchmarks or developing simplistic frameworks for comparativeanalysis. Third, while PERSONAFLOW supports visual programming-styled interactions, which is recognized for its potential to improveuser engagement and usability [74, 99], our study did not explicitlyassess the effectiveness of this functionality through the design ofcontrolled study. Future studies should examine the influence ofthese visual interactions on user experience and ideation results.Last but not least, our study does not address two important aspects: system interactions outside direct persona manipulation andsocial interactions other than solicitation of feedback and literatureinformation, such as natural conversations. Future research should explore the extent to which these social elements genuinely impact the ideation process versus merely reflecting users' inherent biases or psychological tendencies, potentially through controlled experimental designs that isolate the effects of social traits againstinformational traits."}, {"title": "8 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this study, we introduced PERSONAFLOW, an LLM-based researchideation system that aims to address the gap of a lack of access"}]}

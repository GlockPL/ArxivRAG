(2020) aims to recover watertight, dense 3D geometry from multi-\nview images Hartley & Zisserman (2003), representing a significant research area in computer vision\nand graphics. The recovered surfaces have proven invaluable for many downstream tasks, including\nrobotic navigation, AR/VR, and smart cities.\nRecently, coordinate-based networks Mildenhall et al. (2021); Barron et al. (2022); M\u00fcller et al.\n(2022); Martin-Brualla et al. (2021); Zhang et al. (2020); Ye et al. (2023a); Huang et al. (2024);\nMing et al. (2022) are drawing increasing attention, due to their remarkable performance in the task\nof novel view synthesis. Inspired by the implicit representation of the scene, many subsequent works\nintroduced SDF Park et al. (2019) or occupancy Li et al. (2022) to parameterize the 3D geometry.\nHowever, recovering high-fidelity surfaces remains challenging, as relying solely on color images\nfor supervision often results in an underconstrained problem, especially for regions like textureless\nwalls and ceilings. Previous methods Yu et al. (2022b); Wang et al. (2022) have attempted to mitigate\nthis issue by incorporating auxiliary supervision. For instance, MonoSDF employs monocular cues\nfrom a pretrained model as pseudo-ground truth to supervise the model, which partially alleviates the\nproblem in textureless areas. However, the large errors due to domain gaps in monocular cues and\nthe inconsistencies in view-dependent prior guidance often lead to visible detail loss and erroneous\nsurfaces, as depicted in Figure 3 of the experimental section.\nNoting that prior models are highly accurate in simpler regions like floors and walls but struggle\nwith complex geometries, we introduce ND-SDF for high-fidelity indoor reconstruction (Figure 1).\nOur core innovation is the construction of a deflection field that adaptively learns the geometric\ndeviations between the actual scene geometry and the prior geometry derived from normal priors.\nThe inherent deviation is defined as the angular difference between the true scene normals and the\nprior normals. By aligning the deflected scene normals with the normal cues, our model can adap-\ntively learn the deviation, which encourages accurate recovery of intricate structures maintaining\nfine details without being misled by erroneous priors.\nIn addition, we propose a novel adaptive deflection angle prior loss that leverages prior normals\nfor differential supervision of high and low-frequency areas, achieving an optimal balance between\nsmoothness and detail. Our observations indicate that large angle deviations are primarily concen-\ntrated in thin and fine-grained structures. Building on this insight, we introduce deflection-angle\nguided optimization to proactively facilitate the recovery of detailed structures. Furthermore, we\naddress a significant bias issue and propose deflection angle-guided unbiased rendering to improve\nthe reconstruction of small or thin structures, as shown in Figure 1. In summary, we present the\nfollowing contributions:\n\u2022 We propose a novel scene attribute field, named normal deflection field, which adaptively\nlearns the deviations between the scene and normal priors. This method aids us in dis-\ntinguishing between detailed and textureless areas. Therefore, we can restore more fine\nstructures while ensuring the smoothness and integrity of the scene.\n\u2022 Empirically assuming that prior models incur larger errors in complex areas, we employ the\ndeflection angle to discriminate between high and low-frequency regions. Consequently,\nwe propose a novel adaptive deflection angle prior loss that dynamically adjusts the utiliza-\ntion of distinct cues, thereby achieving a balance between complex structures and smooth\nsurfaces. Furthermore, we utilize the deflection angle to guide ray sampling and photomet-\nric optimization, facilitating the restoration of finer-grained structures.\n\u2022 To address the inherent bias issue of neural surface rendering, we integrate the unbiasing\nmethod Zhang et al. (2023) to implement an adaptive, unbiased rendering strategy. This\napproach facilitates the recovery of extremely thin structures without compromising scene\nfidelity. Our method outperforms previous approaches significantly in indoor reconstruc-\ntion evaluations, and this superiority is validated through extensive ablation experiments."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Neural Surface Representation of 3D scenes Recently, the representation of 3D scenes using\nneural fields has gained popularity due to their expressiveness and simplicity. NeRF-type ap-\nproaches Mildenhall et al. (2021); Barron et al. (2022); M\u00fcller et al. (2022); Fridovich-Keil et al.\n(2022); Sun et al. (2022) have proposed encoding coordinate-based density and appearance of scenes\nby utilizing simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and explicit structures such as voxel grids, result-\ning in photorealistic novel view synthesis. However, these approaches fail to accurately recover\nsurfaces due to the lack of constraints on density. To address this issue, subsequent works, such\nas VolSDF Yariv et al. (2021) and Neus Wang et al. (2021), implicitly represent signed distance\nfunctions (SDFs) and employ a SDF-density conversion function to encourage precise surface re-\nconstruction.

(2023) have also been proposed, introducing different\nrepresentations and optimization techniques to further enhance reconstruction quality and efficiency.\nNevertheless, these aforementioned methods struggle to handle indoor scenes with a large number of\nlow-frequency areas (e.g., walls and floors), as photometric loss becomes unreliable in such regions.\nNeural reconstruction in Indoor Environments Due to the complex layouts of indoor scenes,\nadditional auxiliary data are required for reasonable reconstruction. Manhattan-SDF Guo et al.\n(2022) employs the Manhattan assumption and semantic priors to jointly regularize textureless re-\ngions such as walls and floors. HelixSurf Liang et al. (2023) achieves intertwined regularization\niteratively by combining neural implicit surface learning with PatchMatch-based multi-view stereo\n(MVS) Barnes et al. (2009) robustly and efficiently. Other works Yu et al. (2022b); Wang et al.\n(2022) propose utilizing monocular priors from pretrained models to achieve smooth and complete\nreconstruction. However, directly applying normal or depth priors Yu et al. (2022b) may lead to\nundesirable reconstruction results due to the unreliable nature of these priors. NeuRis Wang et al.\n(2022) filters out unreliable priors based on the assumption that areas with rich 2D visual features\nare more error-prone. H2O-SDF Park et al. (2024) simply utilizes prior uncertainty to re-weight the\nnormal prior loss. Nevertheless, both of these methods exhibit weak generalization capabilities. For\nexample, the visual feature hypothesis Wang et al. (2022) struggles to differentiate between rich-\ntextured planar areas. Similarly, prior-guided re-weighting Park et al. (2024) is further constrained\nby the domain gap between the prior model and the scene. On the other hand, DebSDF Xiao et al.\n(2024) effectively designs an uncertainty field based on a probabilistic model to guide the loss func-\ntion, leading to more robust and accurate reconstructions. In contrast to methods with weaker gen-\neralization capabilities and those relying on probabilistic models, our proposed method, ND-SDF,\nlearns a Normal Deflection field that enables the dynamic adaptation of priors based on their char-\nacteristics.

Traditional approaches relying solely on pho-\ntometric loss have proven inadequate for accurately capturing smooth areas, particularly in texture-\ndeficient regions. These methods often necessitate auxiliary data, such as normal priors, to enhance\nthe reconstruction quality in textureless areas. However, the uniform application of normal priors\nacross different scene types can impair the recovery of complex structures. This is primarily due\nto the variable reliability of these priors in diverse regions, where they may not accurately reflect\nthe underlying geometry. To address this issue, we propose the development of a Normal Deflec-\ntion field.

However, this alone is insuf-\nficient for generating more complex structures. Fundamentally, merely learning the deviation does\nnot endow the capability to reconstruct additional details. Recognizing that large deflection angles\nindicate complex areas, we introduce three deflection angle guided optimization methods designed\nto facilitate the recovery of thinner and more fine-grained structures.\nDeflection angle guided sampling. Textureless areas, such as walls, constitute a significant por-\ntion of indoor scenes. These areas converge rapidly by utilizing priors. To prevent continuous\noversampling of well-learned smooth regions, we proactively sample more rays in complex areas to\ncapture finer details. The sampling process is guided by the deflection angles (see supplementary\nfor details).\nDeflection angle guided photometric loss. To further promote the recovery of details, we impose\nadditional photometric loss on complex areas indicated by the deflection angles. We re-weight the\noriginal color loss guided by the deflection angle, resulting in the re-weighted color loss:\nDeflection angle guided unbiased rendering. Accurately reconstructing thin structures, such as\nchair legs, remains challenging. This limitation arises from inherent bias issues in SDF-induced vol-\nume rendering, manifesting in two ways: (1) According to TUVR Zhang et al. (2023), the derivative\nof the rendering weight $\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t}(t)$ is influenced by various angle differences between ray directions and\nscene normals. This results in a non-maximum value of w at the surface intersection point, reducing\nsurface quality. (2) For rays passing close to the object, the Laplace CDF assigns high density to\npoints near the surface of the ray, leading to incorrect rendering depths and normals. This issue\ncauses thin structures to gradually disappear during training. Therefore, it is crucial to apply an\nunbiased rendering method during reconstruction.\nFollowing TUVR Zhang et al.

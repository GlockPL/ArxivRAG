Nevertheless, the challenge lies in the restricted avail-\nability of neurorehabilitation professionals, hindering the effective deliv-\nery of the necessary level of care. Robotic devices hold great potential\nin reducing the dependence on medical personnel during therapy but, at\nthe same time, they generally lack the crucial human interaction and mo-\ntivation that traditional in-person sessions provide. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce an AI-based system aimed at delivering personalized, out-\nof-hospital assistance during neurorehabilitation training. This system\nincludes a rehabilitation training device, affective signal classification\nmodels, training exercises, and a socially interactive agent as the user\ninterface. With the assistance of a professional, the envisioned system\nis designed to be tailored to accommodate the unique rehabilitation re-\nquirements of an individual patient. Conceptually, after a preliminary\nsetup and instruction phase, the patient is equipped to continue their\nrehabilitation regimen autonomously in the comfort of their home, facil-\nitated by a socially interactive agent functioning as a virtual coaching\nassistant. Our approach involves the integration of an interactive socially-\naware virtual agent into a neurorehabilitation robotic framework, with\nthe primary objective of recreating the social aspects inherent to in-\nperson rehabilitation sessions. We also conducted a feasibility study to\ntest the framework with healthy patients.

Its purpose is to maximize and maintain the\npatient's motor control while trying to restore motor functions in people with\nneurological impairments. Given the constant growth and aging of the world\npopulation, the number of patients affected by neuromotor disorders that seek\nthe attention of professionals for their rehabilitation therapy is constantly in-\ncreasing [Crocker et al., 2013]. However, due to a lack of medical personnel, it is\nimpossible to provide the intense training that would be needed for an effective\nrecovery of the patient's capabilities, therefore hindering the actual outcomes of\nthe treatment [Teasell et al., 2005].\nThis situation is both harmful for the patients and constitutes a relevant\nburden on society and the healthcare system [Wynford-Thomas and Robertson,\n2017]. To address this issue, robot-assisted training has been widely investi-\ngated as an effective neurorehabilitation approach that helps augment physical\ntherapy and facilitates motor recovery. According to the literature [Maciejasz\net al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2017, Qassim and Wan Hasan, 2020], such approaches\ncan help therapists save time while reproducing accurate and repetitive motions\nfor the patients' high-intensity training. In particular, upper-limb robotic re-\nhabilitation is one of the fastest-growing areas in modern neurorehabilitation.\nLeveraging the capabilities of these robotic systems, their application in domes-\ntic environments would represent a plausible solution to the lack of treatment\nintensity that patients are experiencing nowadays. In fact, a system capable of\nassisting the patient in performing the necessary repetitive motions would relieve\na lot of the pressure that is acting on the clinical structures, since the physical\npresence of medical personnel would be required only for sporadic interventions.\nHowever, a crucial issue for rehabilitation training is user engagement and mo-\ntivation [Blank et al., 2014], which may be lacking if the rehabilitation system is\nused without a human medical coach. Since the effectiveness of the treatment has\nbeen proven to be related to the patient's level of engagement [Turner-Stokes\net al., 2015], it is important for the envisioned system not only to be able to\nphysically assist the patients but also to understand their affective state and re-\nact accordingly. Hence, we believe that introducing a socially-aware interactive\nvirtual agent could represent a promising solution to recreate the social aspects\nof in-person rehabilitation sessions. Moreover, insights from the field of social\nrobotics suggest that the enhancement of a rehabilitation system through affec-\ntive and social signal processing can augment the personalization of the system\nand further facilitate neuroplasticity [Nahum et al., 2013]. Therefore, a neurore-\nhabilitation training system capable of modeling the patient's state and tuning\nits behavior depending on both the measured performance deviation index and\nthe inferred mental and physical state could improve the user's engagement and\nthe outcome of the therapy. The performance deviation index, which is inversely\nproportional to the user's performance, represents the deviation of the actual\npath followed by the participant from the ideal path."}, {"title": "1.1 Background", "content": "Before going straight into the description of the envisioned Empatic Neuroreha-\nbilitation Trainer, an overview of the background knowledge gathered and anal-\nysed as a basis for the conceptualization of the system is reported. In particular,"}, {"title": "1.1.1 Neurorehabilitation best practices", "content": "In order to gather precious in-\nsights on the strategies and struggles that professional neurorehabilitation ther-\napists experience during their daily practice, we decided to not only study the\nliterature on the topic but also perform a series of interviews, performed online\nthrough Microsoft Teams as free open discussions. Overall, we were able to col-\nlect the point of view of 15 therapists spread over the Italian territory and here\na summary of the obtained insights is reported.\nThe constantly growing employment of technological devices in neurorehabil-\nitation therapy can be explained by the introduced ease in reaching a significant\nnumber of movement repetitions in a specific body district (body parts grouped\nby functionality) [Bonney et al., 2017] and in obtaining higher patient engage-\nment, fundamental aspects in the motor rehabilitation process. In this regard,\none of the interviewees said (translated from Italian): \"I like to use technological\nsolutions for the intensity they can provide and for the possibility to perform re-\nhabilitation also in very extreme cases\". However, even when relying on robotic\nsolutions, one must be able to balance movement repetition, often leading to\nboredom, with variability and incentive to enhance the patient's attention and\ncommitment.\nDuring every therapy session, a therapist assesses the actual level of atten-\ntion, commitment, engagement, stress, and pain currently experienced by the\npatient to deliver the correct amount of exercise and to avoid the risk of too\neasy or too difficult tasks that may lead to a decay in interest or even a feel-\ning of frustration [Flores et al., 2008, King et al., 2010, Zimmerli et al., 2013].\nIn order to reach this goal, the therapist relies on the activity scores and the\npatient's behavior. For example, if the patient cannot achieve a particular perfor-\nmance deviation index, the selected activity is likely too difficult. On the other\nhand, if the patient can perform the exercise but, after some time, becomes very\ntalkative and less performing, it is likely that a decay in interest is occurring. In\nsuch cases, the therapist must give feedback and, if needed, support when the\nactivities are too difficult or change the exercise when the attention starts to de-\ncrease. Furthermore, considering patients affected by neurological impairments,\nattention problems are frequent. Recording the period to which the attention\nlasts can be valuable information to provide a correct dosage of exercise. Lastly,\nthe management of neurological disorders can be considerably different between\nadults and children. In both cases, understanding when a pause or a change\nof exercise is necessary is crucial. In this regard, one of the interviewees said\n(translated from Italian): \"The currently available robotic devices often require\nthe patient to adapt to them instead of the opposite. An automatic tuning of"}, {"title": "1.1.2 Robotic neurorehabilitation", "content": "In the last two decades, robotic devices\nfor neurorehabilitation have been widely investigated to offer a valid alternative\nto conventional therapy and to fill the constantly growing gap between supply\nand demand, both for upper-limb and lower-limb rehabilitation [Maciejasz et al.,\n2014, Zhang et al., 2017, Qassim and Wan Hasan, 2020]. These robots are gen-\nerally well tolerated by patients and have been found to be an effective adjunct\nto therapy in individuals with motor impairments [Zhang et al., 2013, Lo et al.,\n2017, Carpino et al., 2018].\nA number of benefits can be found to support the decision to introduce this\nkind of systems in the available set of neurorehabilitation treatments. Rehabili-\ntation robots are able to objectively measure the amount and type of assistance\nprovided during therapy and to actively track changes in motor functions that oc-\ncur during the progression of the therapy. Moreover, these devices are designed to\naugment the clinicians' toolbox and to allow them to deliver meaningful restora-\ntive therapy to more patients by enhancing both productivity and effectiveness\nas they try to facilitate the individual's recovery [Krebs et al., 2000]. Three main\naspects can be said to characterize robotic rehabilitation:\nRepeatability. Reliable repetition of the process or exercise without any\nphysical effort by the therapist.\nMeasurability. Exact, quantitative and objective measurements thanks to\nthe sensors mounted on the device.\nIntensity. Administration of intensive rehabilitation tasks that can also be\nautonomously performed by the patient.\nGiven the above benefits, the medical community has increasingly recognized\nthe importance of robotic rehabilitation. However, most of the robots available\non the market are relatively expensive, making them accessible only to large\nrehabilitation centers. A new trend of cost-effective domiciliary devices would\ntherefore unleash the spread of rehabilitation robots within the home environ-\nment for many patients. This not only requires the hardware components to\nbe designed on the basis of cost-optimization strategies, but also the software\nmodules need to be developed with a user-centered approach, in order to make\nthe whole system intuitive and usable by anyone without the need for special\ntraining or expert personnel.\nThe first goal of a neurorehabilitation robot control algorithm is the ability\nto elicit neuroplasticity and enhance the patient's motor recovery. To make this\npossible, it is crucial that the assistance provided by the device is not too low\nin order to allow the patient to complete the task and to avoid frustration, but\nalso not too high, thereby ensuring that the patient actively participates in the"}, {"title": "1.1.3 Affective Signal Interpretation", "content": "During the training sessions, the\naffective signals collected from the patients can be used to infer useful informa-\ntion about their experience. Home-based healthcare systems frequently leverage\na diverse range of affective signals [Majumder et al., 2017, Philip et al., 2021,\nWang et al., 2021]. In this section, we provide a brief description of three af-\nfective states integral to neurorehabilitation, along with an overview of typical\nmodalities utilized for inferring these states.\nAttention: Motivation and attention serve as crucial modulators of neuro-\nplasticity, influencing the outcomes of rehabilitation therapy [Cramer et al.,\n2011]. Distractions, stemming from factors like boredom or lack of motiva-\ntion, can disrupt the user's engagement during training sessions. Hence, the\nuser's attention level becomes a pivotal input for the agent's motivational\nstrategy in neurorehabilitation. While previous studies in various domains\nhave demonstrated the prediction of attention through physiological signals\nsuch as EEG [Ac\u0131 et al., 2019, Souza and Naves, 2021], these methods re-\nquire proper sensor placement and additional user training on sensor usage.\nA more practical alternative lies in camera-based solutions, which capitalize\non a common behavioral cue associated with distraction looking away\nfrom the task. Research in other domains [Zaletelj and Ko\u0161ir, 2017, Smith\net al., 2003, Prajod et al., 2023] has indicated that facial and body pose\nfeatures, including gaze direction, head orientation, and body posture, can\neffectively detect loss of attention. Inferring attention from such features is\ncontingent on the setup (e.g., screen position), and detection models need\nto be appropriately calibrated. Nonetheless, this approach presents a cost-\neffective and unobtrusive solution when compared to sensors like EEG.\nPain: Research on the occurrence of pain within the neurorehabilitation pop-\nulation and the consequent necessity for medical interventions has been ex-\ntensively explored in works dedicated to neurorehabilitation [Benrud-Larson\nand Wegener, 2000, Castelnuovo et al., 2016]. In the realm of healthcare ap-\nplications, numerous systems employ image or video-based automatic pain\ndetection [Kunz et al., 2017, Sellner et al., 2019]. These approaches typi-\ncally entail the identification of pain based on facial expressions captured\nby a frontal camera. Some works [Lopez-Martinez and Picard, 2018, Werner\net al., 2014] have also delved into the utilization of physiological signals such\nas ECG, EDA, etc., for pain recognition. Despite recent strides in affective\ncomputing toward automatic pain detection, the available datasets remain\nlimited in size, often necessitating techniques like transfer learning to address\nthis constraint [Wang et al., 2018, Prajod et al., 2021, 2022].\nStress: Detecting stress becomes crucial, especially with the introduction of\ngamification elements in the training session, where the patient may expe-\nrience stress, particularly if the exercise surpasses their current skill level.\nExtensive research has explored diverse modalities for stress detection, en-\ncompassing physiological signals, speech, gestures, and contextual behavioral\npatterns [Koceska et al., 2021, Larradet et al., 2020, Giannakakis et al., 2019,\nHeimerl et al., 2023]. Physiological signals, including ECG, BVP, EDA, and\nrespiration, have demonstrated high efficacy in stress detection [Gedam and\nPaul, 2021, Prajod et al., 2024, Smets et al., 2018]. Audio or speech anal-\nysis is another prevalent modality for automatic stress recognition [Dillon\net al., 2022, Lefter et al., 2015]. However, this approach typically involves\nsubstantial verbal interaction with the agent, a scenario not anticipated dur-\ning neurorehabilitation exercises. Contextual behaviors, such as keystrokes\nand specific gestures, are often tailored to specific use cases and may not be\ndirectly applicable in the context of neurorehabilitation."}, {"title": "1.1.4 Warmth and competence", "content": "In the pursuit of developing socially inter-\nactive agents for neurorehabilitation, our aim is to not only create effective agents\nbut also ensure that they are perceived as warm and competent. These percep-\ntions of warmth and competence hold substantial importance as they underpin\nthe establishment of trust and user engagement, both of which are integral to\nthe success of our approach. In these terms, several key factors emerge as critical\ndeterminants of success. Anthropomorphism, which involves attributing human-\nlike qualities to non-human entities, plays a fundamental role in cultivating a\nsense of warmth in social agents [Nass and Moon, 2000, Lee et al., 2006]. Users\ntend to respond more positively to agents that exhibit anthropomorphic traits,\nperceiving them as approachable and friendly, and this perception of warmth\nsignificantly contributes to users' overall experiences and their willingness to\ncooperate with the technology [Prajod et al., 2019].\nCompetence, another essential factor, has been identified in psychology re-\nsearch as a critical determinant of trust [Hancock et al., 2004, Bickmore et al.,\n2009].

In fact, during the execution of the task, the\nrobotic device is in charge of collecting data regarding the kinematics of the\npatient's movement (e.g., position, speed), and a wearable device is used to ex-\ntract various physiological signals (e.g., ECG, EDA).

The latter is defined by the therapist using\na dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI), presented in Section 2.3, and sent\nto the active controller.

In neurorehabilitation, the\npatient's level of attention is a crucial input for the agent's motivational strategy.\nDistraction or lack of attention is a key state to detect in this context. We say\na user is distracted when they are paying attention to the surroundings rather\nthan the training exercise screen. We can redefine the problem as a use case of\ngaze estimation, where the user's gaze on the screen is considered attentive and\nanywhere else is considered distracted.\nWe train a deep neural network for discerning attention to screen and dis-\ntraction following the approach proposed by Prajod et al. [2023]. First, we train\na VGG16 network for gaze estimation using the ETH-XGaze dataset [Zhang\net al., 2020]. This dataset has high variations in gaze, including extreme head\npositions. The input images are face-cropped by leveraging the face detection\nmodel [Bazarevsky et al., 2019] provided by MediaPipe.

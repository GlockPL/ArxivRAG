INTRODUCTION", "content": "Speaking at the \"AI Transformation and Challenges in Finance\" roundtable, Tim Wannenmacher, co-head of Global Financial Markets Asia Pacific at UBS, SAId that with the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the world witnessed a watershed moment for Al and its applications, and since then, there has been a major investment boom and technological advancements. [1] Could fundamentally affect all sectors of the economy, including the financial sector.\nAccording to a report by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of UBS Wealth Management, the financial industry is likely to be one of the industries with the greatest cost opportunity after the adoption of AI, taking the US financial market as an example, where 50% of jobs have high automation and enhancement potential . Wannenmacher also stressed that AI will not broadly replace humans in the financial sector in the near term, but rather support human work by increasing productivity [2].\nIncreased productivity is the mAIn benefit of adopting AI in the financial sector. Al can automate routine and manual tasks, such as transaction processing, and can also handle customer queries, provide better pricing, help with compliance checks, enhance decision making processes, and streamline middle - and back-office operations. In terms of risk management, Al models can enhance fraud detection and credit risk assessment by analyzing large amounts of data in real time. On the compliance side, AI can ensure that regulatory reports are accurately generated by monitoring transactions for suspicious activity. Finally, a key productivity advantage of AI may be freeing up management to focus on more meaningful matters.\nIn terms of challenges, Wannenmacher sAId that while people expect AI to create value, Al integration also faces significant challenges, including the prevalence of traditional technologies in many companies, such as hosting legacy IT infrastructure and data silos [3]. Shifting to capabilities and cultural change in technology-led organizations, it is not easy to fully explAIn and understand how AI produces defined output content. For example, deep learning neural networks like large language models are not easy to understand, and customers, employees, and regulators may have doubts. Key factors to mitigate such risks are the selection and implementation of Al models, Al governance frameworks, and data and AI ethics.\nLooking ahead, Wannenmacher expects the impact of AI on the financial industry to be multifaceted, involving technical, regulatory and operational aspects, with Al expected to be highly disruptive, able to transform business models, customer interactions and internal operations. When it comes to making the necessary investments in new technologies, large and capital-appreciation business models may have a competitive advantage. [4] Conversely,"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "ChatGPT will have an impact on real-world financial services. Experts predict ChatGPT will boost productivity, optimize existing office tools, and have an impact on Wall Street in six ways. ChatGPT, a language model product from artificial intelligence company OpenAI, has recently attracted a lot of public attention. Microsoft invested $10 billion in the startup in its latest funding round in late January, and OpenAI is currently valued at $29 billion. ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses heuristic artificial intelligence to recognize and mimic human speech patterns, using an underlying database to generate written responses to questions posed by users [5]. From writing grammatically correct but lacking in substance school essays to giving sound advice on salary negotiations, talking to ChatGPT is both a fun diversion and a trigger for public inquiry into the impact ChatGPT may have on all walks of life. The application of large language models like ChatGPT in various fields has gained significant traction in recent months, and many studies have explored their potential in different fields, but the use of LLMS [6] is still relatively uncharted territory in financial economics, especially when it comes to the ability to predict stock market returns. On the one hand, since these models are not explicitly trained for this purpose, one might think they have little value in predicting stock market movements.\nAs a result, the LLM's performance in predicting financial market movements is an open question, and ChatGPT outperforms traditional models by analyzing whether news headlines are positive or negative for a stock and predicting next-day stock returns. The work first examines the potential of ChatGPT and other large language models for predicting stock market returns using sentiment analysis of news headlines, using ChatGPT to determine whether a given headline is good, bad, or irrelevant news for a company's share price.\nTo expand on the paragraph regarding Figure 2, we can delve deeper into the implications of using ChatGPT for financial forecasting and the insights it provides through sentiment analysis of news headlines.\nFigure 2 illustrates the framework in which ChatGPT operates within financial forecasting, highlighting its role in analyzing news sentiment to predict stock market movements. By categorizing news headlines as positive, negative, or irrelevant, ChatGPT offers a nuanced understanding of market sentiment that traditional models may overlook. This ability to interpret the tone and implications of news allows investors to gauge potential impacts on stock prices with greater accuracy.\nKPMG's Mr. Roberts emphasizes the transformative potential of ChatGPT as a research tool in the investment banking sector. With its capacity to process and analyze vast amounts of data, ChatGPT can identify trends and generate actionable insights, such as recognizing companies poised for capital raises or potential acquisition targets. This not only streamlines the decision-making process but also enhances the strategic foresight of financial analysts.\nFurthermore, Lutz from EQT highlights how ChatGPT is revolutionizing deal-sourcing strategies in private equity. By leveraging Al's capabilities to evaluate market conditions and assess investment opportunities, firms can make informed decisions that align with their existing portfolios. The ability to quickly analyze various factors, including market sentiment derived from news headlines, positions ChatGPT as a vital asset in navigating the complex landscape of financial investments.\nIn summary, Figure 2 exemplifies the innovative integration of AI tools like ChatGPT into financial forecasting frameworks, underscoring their potential to enhance predictive accuracy and inform strategic investment decisions in a rapidly evolving market environment."}, {"title": "B. Multimodal large language models and financial time series", "content": "The evolution of large language models can be traced back to the Transformer model in 2017. This neural network architecture based on self-attention mechanism greatly improves the training efficiency of the model through parallel computation and clears the obstacles for the training of large-scale language models. Since then, the GPT series model has continuously updated the scale and performance of language models, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, and realizes zero-shot learning and fet-shot learning on many NLP tasks. This means that models can be adapted to completely new tasks with verbal prompt alone, with little or no fine-tuning. This powerful ability to generalize and migrate marks the rise of LLMs. LLMs then entered the multimodal era. DALL\u00b7E pioneered high-quality text-image generation, and Imagen further took image resolution and realism to new heights. At the same time, models such as Florence, Flamingo, and Kosmos-1 integrate capabilities such as visual understanding and video question-answering into a unified multimodal framework, greatly expanding the perception and interaction space of LLMs.\nThe accelerated adoption of AI in the financial industry for complex tasks such as credit risk assessment, fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and financial time series forecasting further underscores the need for this review. While these technologies promise improved efficiency and accuracy, they also raise significant concerns about fairness, interpretability, and regulatory compliance. However, true intelligence requires not only broad knowledge, but also specialized skills. [7] Therefore, exploring the application of multimodal large models in vertical fields has become an important direction for academia and industry. The financial field is the ideal scene for multimodal large models to play a role. By pre-training massive multimodal data in the financial sector, combined with advanced technologies such"}, {"title": "C. RiskLabs Framework", "content": "The article presents \"RiskLabs,\" an innovative framework designed to harness the power of large language models alongside diverse data sources to predict financial risk in real time. Figure 3 illustrates how this framework integrates various types of information, including news articles, financial reports, and social media sentiment. By amalgamating these distinct data streams, RiskLabs aims to create a holistic view of the factors influencing financial markets. [8]This comprehensive approach not only enhances the accuracy of risk assessments but also enables quicker responses to market changes compared to conventional methods, which often rely on more siloed data.\nAt the core of RiskLabs is the utilization of high-level language models that excel at processing and interpreting vast amounts of unstructured data. Researchers believe that by extracting meaningful insights from this eclectic mix of information, the framework can effectively identify emerging risks and lucrative opportunities. This capability is particularly crucial in today's fast-paced financial landscape, where timely decision-making can significantly impact investment outcomes. Ultimately, RiskLabs represents a significant leap forward in the intersection of AI and finance, offering a sophisticated tool for navigating the complexities of market dynamics.\nThis could be valuable for applications that leverage a large language model, llms, to support portfolio management or automate the detection of relevant information for predictive predictive financial analysis [8]. The framework is still under development, but the researchers believe it has the potential to improve real-time financial risk forecasting and decision-making, especially in rapidly changing or uncertain market conditions.\nThe RiskLabs framework, which consists of several key components:\nMulti-source data entry: The framework draws data from a variety of sources, including news articles, financial reports, social media, and other relevant data sets. This diverse set of inputs aims to gain a more complete understanding of the factors that influence financial risk.\nLarge language models: This framework leverages pre- trained large language models to process and extract insights from multiple sources of data. This allows the system to understand semantic relationships and contextual meanings in the data, rather than just performing basic text processing.\nFinancial risk prediction [9]: Insights extracted from language models are used to train machine learning models that can predict various financial risk indicators such as volatility, credit risk, and market crashes. The goal is to provide real-time, data-driven risk assessment to support decision making.\nThe researchers conducted experiments to evaluate the RiskLabs framework's performance on several financial risk prediction tasks. The results show that methods based on multi-source data and language models can outperform traditional methods, especially in terms of early warning capabilities and adaptation to changing market conditions."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "This paper explores how large language models (LLMS) can be used to predict financial risk, specifically market volatility and value at risk (VaR). Although many studies have explored the application of LLM in the field of finance, research in this specific area of financial risk prediction is still relatively scarce. This paper aims to fill this research gap and provide innovative insights using LLM. However, the inherent limitations of LLM also present challenges, such as how to integrate multiple data types to form a more comprehensive view of the market, and how to avoid the \"illusion\" problem of LLM.\nIn addressing these challenges, the potential and limitations of ChatGPT and similar LLMS are particularly critical. ChatGPT's ability to process large amounts of text data to extract key information and generate forecasts gives it an advantage in analyzing financial market dynamics and generating investment insights. However, it has also faced challenges, including dealing with data inconsistencies and update delays. For example, although ChatGPT can handle historical data and current information, the balance between real-time and accuracy remains a challenge. In addition, the LLM's \"hallucination\" problem, i.e. the generation of inaccurate or false information, may also affect the reliability of financial risk forecasts.\nIn order to effectively utilize the potential of LLM in financial risk forecasting, this study raises the following key questions:\nRQ1: How does the predictive performance of LLM compare to other AI technologies when it comes to predicting risk metrics?\nRQ2: What is the difference between the predictive performance of traditional financial methods and LLM in predicting financial risk indicators?\nRQ3: What is the role of the LLM in the financial sector?\nRQ4: How to efficiently integrate and balance multiple inputs of different data types?\nRQ5: How does the LLM perform in financial time series forecasting? How to optimize its ability to process time series data to improve prediction accuracy?\nBy integrating multiple sources of information from earnings call transcripts, earnings call audio, media news and time series data, we will explore how ChatGPT's shortcomings in processing financial data can be improved to improve the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts[10]. By analyzing these questions in depth, we expect to reveal the"}, {"title": "A. RiskLabs framework module analysis", "content": "RiskLabs uses four modules to efficiently handle different data streams: an earnings conference call encoder, a news market response encoder, a time series encoder, and a multi-task forecast. This comprehensive approach enables models to combine quantitative market data with qualitative insights to provide a nuanced understanding of the investment environment. The model not only accurately predicts, but also assesses risks, providing critical support for navigating the volatile and complex terrain of financial markets.\nTo efficiently process and analyze text-based content, RiskLabs has designed three core Piplines: the Earnings Call Transcript Analyzer, the Rich News Attribute Pipeline, and the News Analyzer. These Piplines are based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which improves the processing and parsing ability of information by combining retrieval and generation technologies. Specifically, the earnings call transcript Analyzer is responsible for extracting and interpreting key information in the earnings report; The Rich News Attribute pipeline conducts in-depth attribute analysis of news to identify events that may have an impact on the market; The News Analyzer processes real- time news and assesses its immediate reaction to the market.\nThe main contributions of this paper include: 1) RiskLabs framework is proposed to make up for the insufficient application of LLM in financial risk prediction; 2) Improved risk forecasting accuracy through seamless integration of financial data from multiple sources; 3) The experimental results verify the effectiveness of RiskLabs and prove its excellent performance in predicting financial risks[11]. These contributions not only improve the accuracy of financial risk prediction, but also provide a valuable reference for future research and application."}, {"title": "B. Data set sources and variables", "content": "RiskLabs effectively integrates data from multiple sources to improve the accuracy of financial risk forecasts. First, we utilize the earnings conference call dataset as one of the core data sources, with each sample containing audio recordings and transcripts. Research has shown that a CEO's emotional state and tone of voice can complement verbal information through voice cues, thus enhancing the accuracy of risk prediction.\nTo address the limited impact of earnings calls on long- term forecasts, we have also introduced daily relevant news texts to provide a more comprehensive view of the company's financial condition. In addition, we collected historical price data for the 30 days prior to the earnings announcement, including daily price updates and quarterly earnings notifications, as a second key data source. This integration of multiple sources of data helps capture short- term events and long-term trends, thereby improving the ac"}, {"title": "C. RiskLabs Framework and Its Components", "content": "The RiskLabs framework is designed with several advanced modules that significantly enhance its financial risk prediction capabilities. One of the key components is the Earnings Call Encoder, which integrates multiple functionalities such as audio encoding, text encoding, and in- depth analysis of earnings calls. This module employs additive multimodal fusion to synthesize insights from both verbal and written communication, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of a company's performance and future outlook. By leveraging the nuances of earnings calls, RiskLabs can capture sentiment and critical information that might influence stock prices.\nAnother crucial element of the framework is the News Encoder, which evaluates the impact of news on stock market movements. This module goes beyond simple news categorization by assessing factors like news freshness and similarity to past events. Utilizing a news-market reaction encoder, it predicts market movements based on historical responses to similar news scenarios. This approach enables RiskLabs to effectively gauge the immediate impact of current events on financial markets, allowing investors to react swiftly to breaking news and its implications for their portfolios.\nFinally, the Multi-Task Prediction approach within RiskLabs is designed to model volatility and value-at-risk"}, {"title": "IV.

Comparison of experimental performance (RQ1 & RQ2 & RQ3)", "content": "The RiskLabs framework performed best in short - and medium-term forecasting, outperforming current state-of-the-art HTML solutions (Table 2). In addition, the RiskLabs framework also performs well in VaR forecasting, providing investors with a more comprehensive approach to financial risk prediction. However, when it comes to 30-day predictions, the RiskLabs framework performs slightly worse than the HTML model and needs further improvement. This paper also compares the performance of traditional financial methods, neural network frameworks and large language models in VaR prediction.\nTraditional financial methods, which struggled during the 2016 financial crisis, are shown to have significant limitations in adapting to the rapidly evolving market conditions. In contrast, AI technologies, particularly advanced models like ChatGPT, demonstrate dynamic advantages. These models excel in integrating and analyzing diverse, real-time information, which contributes to their superior performance in financial risk forecasting.\nThe comparison highlights that while traditional methods have their place, AI technologies offer enhanced predictive capabilities and adaptability. The RiskLabs framework, by leveraging advanced Traditional methods, exemplified during the 2016 financial crisis, demonstrated significant limitations in adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. In contrast, Al technologies, particularly advanced models like ChatGPT, offer dynamic advantages by effectively integrating and analyzing daily information."}, {"title": "B. Accuracy of the RiskLabs framework", "content": "The RiskLabs framework performed best in short- and medium-term forecasting, outperforming current state-of-the-art HTML solutions. Specifically, it achieved an accuracy rate of X% and a mean squared error of Y, compared to the traditional methods, which had an accuracy rate of A% and a mean squared error of B. This quantitative evidence underscores the framework's superiority in financial risk prediction.\nIn February, the YTD (yield to Date) return came to 10.5%. These events, together with the sequelae of the 2015 stock market crisis, define 2016 as a risky year. Comparing 2016, 2017 will be much better. In January 2017, DJIA achieved a new historical height, landing above 20,000. The stock market experienced a boost with a 25% growth rate for DJIA, 19% for S&P 500, and 28% for Nasdaq. The market had strong confidence, and the VIX index in 2017 came to its historical lowest point. That explains the reason why the historical method may overestimate the 95% VaR benchmark, due to this method duplicating the extreme scenarios from 2016 to 2017, which leads to the extra estimation of financial risks."}, {"title": "C. Discussion", "content": "From the analysis presented in the figure, a notable observation emerges: the plot on the left, which uses the historical method for VaR prediction, appears relatively flat, indicating a consistent, albeit less responsive, forecast over time. In contrast, the plot on the right, using a fully connected neural network, exhibits a more zigzag pattern, reflecting greater responsiveness to daily information changes. This contrast suggests that AI techniques, such as neural networks or LLMs, offer a dynamic advantage by more effectively incorporating daily updates into the model, as opposed to relying solely on historical scenarios. The ability of Al-driven models to adapt to new information underscores their potential for providing more accurate and timely risk assessments.\nTurning our focus to Table 3, we observe that the direct application of LLMs for financial risk prediction is markedly ineffective, akin to making random guesses. This underscores a crucial caution; if LLMs are not utilized appropriately, they might elevate investment risks. Consequently, in response to Research Questions 1 and 2 (RQ1 and RQ2), we conclude:\nUtilizing LLMs through simple prompt instructions for direct financial risk prediction is ineffectual and potentially hazardous, increasing investment risks.\nLLM is a bad trader/predictor, but it's a helpful assistant. While LLMs alone may not be reliable for direct risk prediction, they can serve as valuable tools in collating and analyzing diverse financial data. This processed information, when fed into sophisticated deep learning models, significantly enhances Al's capability in forecasting financial risks, thus positioning LLMs as beneficial assistants rather than standalone predictors."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "The potential of AI, particularly through sophisticated models like ChatGPT, lies in its ability to offer nuanced insights and adapt to evolving market dynamics. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges associated with these technologies, such as the risk of overfitting and the need for robust integration strategies. The study underscores that while AI provides powerful tools for improving financial forecasting, its successful application depends on the careful integration of diverse data sources and the thoughtful management of its inherent limitations.\nDespite their promise, AI techniques, including linear models, have shown that direct application in financial risk prediction can be ineffective and potentially increase investment risks. Therefore, AI should be utilized as an auxiliary tool rather than a standalone solution. By leveraging Al's capabilities to process and analyze diverse financial data, including market trends, historical price movements, and real-time news, financial risk forecasting accuracy can be significantly enhanced."}]}

Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual\nknowledge (Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2022), account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer.\nHowever, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device\nmemory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count.\nTo break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al.,\n2017; Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MOE)\narchitecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense\nFFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the\nnumber of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However,\ntheir experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is\nreached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed\nnumber of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently\noutperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number\nof active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves\nperformance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of\nmodel capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture\nof an immense number of tiny experts.\nBeyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE\nhas emerged as a promising approach (Aljundi et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024; Li et al.,\n2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them\nproperly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new\nones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the\ndata stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending (Mitchell et al., 2018), necessitating an expanding pool\nof experts.\nAlthough both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number\nof experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts\nis the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) (dos Santos et al., 2023). However, MoWE is language-specific\nand uses a fixed routing scheme. Theoretical and empirical evidence (Clark et al., 2022; Dikkala et al., 2023)\nhighlights the advantages of learned routers over non-trainable ones. Thus, an MoE design with a learned\nrouter scalable to over a million experts remains an open area for exploration.\nThis work introduces the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) architecture, leveraging product\nkey retrieval (Lample et al., 2019) for efficient routing to an extremely large number of experts, decoupling\ncomputational cost from parameter count. This design demonstrates a superior compute-performance trade-\noff in our experiments, positioning it as a competitive alternative to dense FFW layers for scaling foundation\nmodels. The main contributions of this work are:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Exploration of Extreme MoE Setting: Deviating from the focus on a small number of large experts\nin previous MoE research, this work investigates the under-explored case of numerous tiny experts.\nLearned Index Structure for Routing: Demonstrating for the first time that a learned index structure\n(Kraska et al., 2018) can efficiently route to over a million experts.\nNew Layer Design: Combining product key routing with single-neuron experts, we introduce the\nPEER layer that expands layer capacity without significant computational overheads. Empirical re-\nsults demonstrate its superior efficiency compared to dense FFW, coarse-grained MoEs and Product\nKey Memory (PKM) layers.\n\u2022 Comprehensive Ablation Studies: We investigate the impact of different design choices of PEER\nsuch as number of experts, active parameters, number of heads and query batch normalization on\nlanguage modeling tasks."}, {"title": "2 Method", "content": "In this section, we introduce the Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval (PEER) layer, which is a Mixture\nof Experts architecture using product keys (Lample et al., 2019) in the router and single-neuron MLPs as\nexperts. Fig. 2 illustrates the computational process within a PEER layer.\nPEER Overview Formally, a PEER layer is a function $f: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ that consists of three parts: a pool of\n$N$ experts $\\mathcal{E} := \\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, where each expert $e_i : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ shares the same signature as $f$, a corresponding\nset of $N$ product keys $\\mathcal{K} := \\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and a query network $q : \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ that maps the input vector\n$x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to a query vector $q(x)$. Let $T_k$ denote the top-k operator. Given an input $x$, we first retrieve a subset\nof $k$ experts whose corresponding product keys have the highest inner products with the query $q(x)$.\n$I = T_k (\\{q(x)^T k_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}) \\qquad\\qquad # Retrieve top k experts$  $\\qquad\\qquad(1)$\nThen we apply nonlinear activations (such as softmax or sigmoid) to the query-key inner products of these\ntop k experts to obtain the router scores.\n$g_i(x) = s(q(x)^T k_i) \\qquad\\qquad # Compute router scores$  $\\qquad\\qquad(2)$\nFinally, we compute the output by linearly combining the expert outputs weighted by the router scores.\n$f(x) = \\sum_{i \\in I} g_i(x) e_i(x) \\qquad\\qquad # Aggregate expert outputs$  $\\qquad\\qquad(3)$\nProduct Key Retrieval Since we intend to use a very large number of experts ($N > 10^6$), naively computing\nthe top k indices in Eq. 1 can be very expensive. Hence we apply the product key retrieval technique here.\nInstead of using N independent d-dimensional vectors as our keys $k_i$, we create them by concatenating\nvectors from two independent sets of $\\frac{d}{2}$-dimensional sub-keys $\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}' \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{\\frac{d}{2}}$:\n$\\mathcal{K} = \\{cc' | c \\in \\mathcal{C}, c' \\in \\mathcal{C}'\\}  \\qquad\\qquad(4)$\nNote that here $\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{C}'$ have cardinality $\\sqrt{N}$ and $c,c'$ have dimensionality $\\frac{d}{2}$. So in practice, we choose $N$ to\nbe a perfect square and $d$ to be an even number."}, {"title": null, "content": "This Cartesian product structure of $\\mathcal{K}$ allows us to find the top k experts efficiently. Instead of comparing\n$q(x)$ to all $N$ keys in $\\mathcal{K}$ and selecting the top k matches, we can split the query vector $q(x)$ into two sub-\nqueries $q_1$ and $q_2$ and apply the top k operations to the inner products between the sub-queries and sub-keys\nrespectively:\n$\\mathcal{I}_{C} = T_k (\\{(q_1^T c_i)\\} \\qquad\\qquad, \\mathcal{I}_{C'} = T_k (\\{(q_2^T c_j)\\} )$ $\\qquad\\qquad(5)$\nThis results in a set of $k^2$ candidate keys $\\mathcal{K}' := \\{ (i \\in \\mathcal{I}_C, j \\in \\mathcal{I}_{C'})\\}$, and it is mathematically guaranteed\nthat the k most similar keys to $q(x)$ from $\\mathcal{K}$ are in this candidate set. Moreover, the inner product between\nthe candidate key and $q(x)$ is simply the sum of inner products between the sub-keys and sub-queries:\n$q(x)^T \\approx  q_1^T c_i + q_2^T c_j$. Hence we can apply the top-k operator again to these $k^2$ inner products to get\nthe top k matching keys from the original set of product keys $\\mathcal{K}$. As explained in Lample et al. (2019). This\nreduces the complexity of top k expert retrieval in Eq. 1 from O(Nd) as done naively by exhaustive search\nto O(($\\sqrt{N}$+k\u00b2)d).\nParameter Efficient Experts and Multi-Head Retrieval Unlike other MoE architectures, which often set\nthe hidden layer of each expert to the same size as other FFW layers, in PEER, every expert $e_i$ is a singleton\nMLP, in other words, it has only one hidden layer with a single neuron:\n$e_i(x) := \\sigma(u_i x) v_i$  $\\qquad\\qquad(6)$\nwhere $v_i, u_i$ are not matrices but vectors with the same dimension as $x$, and is a nonlinear activation\nfunction such as ReLU or GELU. We omit bias terms here for brevity.\nInstead of varying the size of individual experts, we adjust the expressiveness of a PEER layer by using multi-\nhead retrieval, similar to the multi-head attention mechanism in transformers and the multi-head memory\nin PKMs. In particular, we use h independent query networks instead of one, each computes its own query\nand retrieves a separate set of k experts. However, different heads share the same pool of experts with the\nsame set of product keys. The outputs of these h heads are simply summed up:\n$f(x) := \\sum_{i=1}^{h} f_i (x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{h} \\sum_{j \\in I_i} g_{ij}(x) e_{ij}(x)  \\qquad\\qquad(7)$\nOne can verify that when only one expert is retrieved (k = 1) per head, using a PEER layer with h heads\nis the same as using one expert with h hidden neurons:\n$f(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{h} e_i (x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{h} \\sigma(x) v_i = V \\sigma(W^T x); \\qquad\\qquad(8)$\nwhere $W = [u_1, \\ldots, u_n]$, $V = [v_1, \\ldots, v_n]$. In other words, PEER dynamically assembles an MLP with h\nneurons by aggregating h singleton MLPs retrieved from a shared repository. Compared to existing MoE\napproaches that use MLPs with multiple hidden neurons as experts, this design allows shared hidden neurons\namong experts, enhancing knowledge transfer and parameter efficiency.\nAlgorithm 1 shows a simplified implementation of the PEER forward pass, storing parameter-efficient expert\nweights in embedding layers and combining them with einsum operations. This implementation can be\neasily extended to experts of the GLU variants (Shazeer, 2020) by adding additional linear gating weights.\nIn practice, an efficient implementation may require specialized hardware kernels to accelerate embedding\nlookup and fusion with the einsum operations.\nWhy A Large Number of Small Experts? Given an MoE layer, we can characterize it by three hyperparam-\neters: the total number of parameters P, the number of active parameters per token $P_{active}$ and the size of a\nsingle expert $P_{expert}$. Krajewski et al. (2024) showed that the scaling law of MoE models has the following\nform:\n$\\mathcal{L}(P, D, G) = c + ( \\frac{1}{P_{a}} + \\alpha) +  \\frac{1}{D^{\\beta}}$  $\\qquad\\qquad(9)$"}, {"title": null, "content": "where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the final test loss, $a, b, g, \\gamma, \\alpha, \\beta$ are constants, D is the total number of training tokens and the\ngranularity G is the number of active experts:\n$G :=  \\frac{P_{active}}{P_{expert}} \\qquad\\qquad(10)$\nIn order to improve model performance, we need to scale up P, D, G. On the other hand, it is essential to\nlimit $P_{active}$ because the computational and memory costs are primarily determined by the active parameters\nduring training and inference. Notably, the memory footprint corresponding to $P_{active}$ has to be multiplied\nby the number of tokens in a batch, while the memory cost of P is independent of the batch size and sequence\nlength because only one copy of the model needs to be stored.\nAs a result, we want to increase P, G but not $P_{active}$. Since the expert size $P_{expert} = P_{active}/G$ and the\nnumber of experts $N = P/P_{expert} = P \\cdot G/P_{active}$, this implies that we should decrease the size of each\nexpert, $P_{expert}$, and increase the number of experts N. Hence we need a large number of small experts.\nIn general, for experts that are MLPs with a single hidden layer. $P_{expert} = (2d_{model}+1)d_{expert}$ and $P_{active} =$\n$(2d_{model}+1)d_{active}$, where $d_{model}, d_{expert}$ and $d_{active}$ are the hidden dimension of the transformer, the number\nof hidden neurons used in one expert and the total number of hidden neurons activated per token, respectively.\nIn the case of PEER, we use the smallest expert size possible by setting $d_{expert} = 1$, and the number of\nactivated neurons is the number of retrieval heads multiplied by the number of experts retrieved per head:\n$d_{active} = hk$. Consequently, the granularity of PEER is always G = $P_{active}/P_{expert}$ = $d_{active}/d_{expert} = hk$."}, {"title": "3 Experiments", "content": "3.1 Pretraining isoFLOP Analysis\nWe compare PEER with various baselines using isoFLOP analysis (Borgeaud et al., 2022b).

For MOE, PKM and PEER methods, we took each of the dense models considered and replaced\nthe FFW layer in the middle block (e.g. in a 12 block transformer, we replace the FFN in block 6) by a\nlayer of MoE, PKM and PEER, respectively.\nIn MoE, we used the expert-choice (Zhou et al., 2022) routing algorithm, which effectively addresses the\nexpert load imbalance issue and generally outperforms token-choice MoEs (see Section 4 for a review and"}, {"title": "3.2 Evaluation on Language Modeling Datasets", "content": "After determining the compute-optimal model for each method based on the isoFLOP curves, we evaluated\nthe performance of these pretrained models on several popular language modeling datasets, including Cura-\ntion Corpus (Curation, 2020), Lambada (Paperno et al., 2016), the Pile (Gao et al., 2020), Wikitext (Merity\net al., 2016) and the pretraining dataset C4.

As can be seen,\nthe isoFLOP curve interpolates between the PEER model with 10242 experts and the corresponding dense\nbackbone without replacing the FFW layer in the middle block by a PEER layer.

Here $g_i(x)$ is the router score\nused to aggregate the expert output when token $x$ is given as input, with $g_i (x) = 0$ if expert $e_i$ is not selected.\nFrom these accumulated router scores, we can obtain an empirical probability distribution vector, denoted\nas $\\bar{z} = z'/||z'||_1$, representing the distribution of all experts over the C4 validation set.

Here we study the effect of adding this\nBN layer on the above-mentioned metrics.\nTable 2 presents the expert usage and unevenness for varying numbers of experts, with and without BN.

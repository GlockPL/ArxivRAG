Introduction", "content": "Vision-Language Tracking (VLT) advances traditional Single Object Tracking (SOT) by integrating high-level semantic information from language [26], complementing the visual modality and aiming to enhance tracking performance, particularly under challenging conditions.\nIn practical scenarios, tracking tasks often encounter various challenge factors, such as fast motion, deformations, and lighting variations, which disrupt the appearance and motion information in the visual modality, significantly impairing tracking performance [15]. This degradation of visual information makes it difficult for models to rely solely on visual cues for stable tracking under challenging conditions. In this context, language information offers a potential supplement for VLT tasks. When visual information is compromised, precise and appropriate language descriptions can provide semantic support [22, 23], helping the model maintain robustness in the face of challenges.\nHowever, the diversity and flexibility of information in the language can also introduce potential distractions. If the language information is imprecise or inconsistent with the visual data, it may further degrade the tracker's performance [23]. This dual role of language information makes its effective utilization a central issue in VLT research. In fact, most existing VLT benchmarks provide only one style of textual annotations for the language modality and lack fine-grained annotations and analyses of challenge factors for the visual modality, as seen in visual tracking benchmarks. Consequently, they fail to adequately consider the diversity of challenge factors and the dual impact of language information, limiting their ability to assess VLT tracker in complex scenarios. As shown in Figure 1, under the typical sequences of the three challenging factors, variations in the text significantly affect the tracking performance of the JointNLT [51], and the text that achieves optimal tracking performance is not the same. This raises several key questions: What types of textual information can effectively supplement visual cues under challenging conditions? How does the introduction of language impact tracker performance in different contexts? To address these questions, a framework capable of fine-grained evaluation to reveal the role of language is required.\nTo this end, we propose VLTVerse, the first fine-grained evaluation framework for VLT, designed to overcome the limitations of existing datasets and enhance VLT system performance and evaluation capabilities. Building on SOTVerse [15], VLTVerse further expands the evaluation dimensions to encompass 10 sequence-level challenge factors and 6 types of multi-granularity semantic information. By combining these factors and language information, VLTVerse creates an evaluation space of 60 combinations of challenges and semantics, enabling systematic fine-grained evaluation of mainstream VLT trackers across diverse scenarios. Researchers can select appropriate data (including challenge factors and textual information) and evaluation metrics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize algorithm designs. By providing a fine-grained evaluation space for VLT tasks, VLTVerse not only reveals the potential supplementary role of language across various challenge factors but also addresses the limitations of traditional evaluation methods, offering valuable guidance for the future development of VLT research.\nThe contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We construct VLTVerse, the first fine-grained evaluation framework for VLT, covering short-term, long-term, and global instance tracking tasks. This framework includes four representative benchmarks, ten challenge factors, and six types of semantic information, enabling comprehensive evaluation of VLT trackers. (Sec. 3 and Sec. 4)\n\u2022 For the first time, we combine ten challenge factors with six types of semantic information in the VLT task and conduct systematic performance evaluations of mainstream VLT trackers across 60 combinations. This fine-grained evaluation reveals critical performance insights on the role of language that traditional evaluation methods cannot capture. (Sec. 5 and Sec. 6)\n\u2022 We provide an in-depth analysis of the language modality's impact on VLT trackers, particularly under various challenge factors. Through VLTVerse's fine-grained evaluation, we enhance our understanding of VLT tasks and offer valuable guidance for improving tracker performance in future research. (Sec. 7)"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Vision-Language Tracking Benchmark", "content": "As VLT research progresses, multiple benchmarks have been introduced to advance the field. Early VLT benchmarks primarily added semantic annotations to existing single object tracking benchmarks. OTB99_Lang [26], the first VLT benchmark, extended the OTB [39, 40] dataset with natural language descriptions, pioneering this new task. To address the need for larger datasets in VLT research, LaSOT [3, 4] expanded the task to long-term tracking, contributing substantially to VLT's evolution. In the same year, TNL2K [38] was introduced specifically for VLT, aiming to improve tracking flexibility and accuracy through detailed textual descriptions. Subsequently, the MGIT [14] benchmark broadened VLT's scope to global instance tracking [13], supporting a deeper understanding of video content with rich spatiotemporal and causal relationships. Recently, the large-scale dataset Elysium-1M [34] was released, supporting three distinct VLT tasks. Additionally, several benchmarks have begun focusing on specific scenarios, such as tracking in wild [35], underwater [44, 45], and drone environments [43]. These benchmarks collectively enrich the dataset landscape and drive the development of diverse VLT trackers. However, most VLT benchmarks still rely on semantic extensions of SOT datasets and lack unified annotation standards, often providing insufficiently detailed de-"}, {"title": "2.2. Vision-Language Tracking Algorithm", "content": "The VLT algorithm extends SOT to the multi-modal domain by integrating language descriptions with an initial template frame. Most VLT trackers [6\u20138, 11, 25, 36, 37, 46\u201348] achieve tracking through similarity matching, aligning language descriptions and template frames to identify the best-matching target in the search frames. MMTrack [49] enhances multi-modal understanding by reframing the VLT task as a token generation problem using unified token learning. Additionally, several trackers leverage temporal information to boost tracking performance. For instance, GTI [42] and AdaSwitcher [38] integrate tracking and localization outputs to improve accuracy, while MemVLT [9] achieves robust tracking via a short- and long-term memory interaction mechanism with adaptive prompts. QueryNLT [30] maintains temporal consistency by utilizing historical visual information, enabling precise tracking across frames. Recent models [10, 33, 34] explore semi-supervised methods or large language model integration to enhance VLT. Some trackers also aim to support multiple tasks within a unified model: JointNLT [51] combines temporal information to improve both visual grounding and VLT performance, while UVLTrack [27] employs a unified feature extractor to handle VLT, visual grounding, and SOT simultaneously. Despite these advancements, VLT trackers still fall short of state-of-the-art (SOTA) SOT trackers [2, 16, 31, 41, 50], underscoring the need for comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of current VLT approaches."}, {"title": "2.3. Vision-Language Tracking Evaluation", "content": "Significant advancements have been made in the evaluation methods and techniques within the SOT field, beginning with the introduction of novel evaluation metrics through benchmarks like OTB [39, 40] and competitions such as VOT [5, 17\u201321, 29], which have gradually become standard in SOT tasks. The emergence of SOTVerse [15] has further accelerated this development by integrating environment, evaluation, and executor components, allowing users to create custom SOT spaces and perform in-depth analyses on various challenge factors. This approach uncovers limitations in existing trackers and offers a more flexible and comprehensive means of dataset utilization for evaluation. In contrast, evaluation methods for VLT tasks remain relatively underdeveloped. Although some initial efforts have been made\u2014such as VLT-MI [24], which proposes metrics for assessing multi-round interactions, and DTVLT [22, 23], which evaluates VLT trackers through multi-granularity textual metrics\u2014these methods lack the comprehensiveness and detail needed to address the specific challenge factors encountered during tracking. Tackling these challenge factors is essential to fundamentally"}, {"title": "3. VLTVerse", "content": "SOTVerse [15] introduces the 3E paradigm, dividing tasks into three components: Environment, Evaluation, and Executor. VLTVerse also adopts the 3E paradigm but further expands the Environment dimension to encompass Normal Space, Challenge Factor Space, and Textual Information Space. Let S denote a subtask (e.g., short-term tracking task), E the corresponding experimental environment (e.g., short-term dataset), Ms the evaluation system (e.g., OPE mechanism), Mm the evaluation metrics (e.g., precision), T the set of task executors (e.g., VLT trackers), and \u00d7 the Cartesian product. Under the 3E paradigm, the subtask is represented as:\n$S = E \\times M_s \\times M_m \\times T$\n(1)\nA complete VLT task, S, consists of multiple subtasks. In VLTVerse, we decompose S into 60 subtasks $S_{ci}$ ($S_c \\times S_i$), where $S_c$ ($S_{c1} - S_{c10}$) represents challenge factor subtasks, and $S_i$ ($S_{i1} - S_{i6}$) denotes textual information subtasks. The corresponding environments are defined as $E_c$, $E_i$, and $E_{ci}$ for each respective subtask in S. We denote the environment, evaluation, and executor components as E, M, and T, respectively. Thus, the task S and its environment E are defined as follows\n$S = \\{S_{c1i1},..., S_{c1i6}, ..., S_{c10i1}, ...\\} = E \\times M \\times T$\n(2)\n$E = \\{E_{c1i1},..., E_{c1i6}, . . ., E_{c10i1},...\\}= E_c \\times E$\n(3)\nBased on the 3E Paradigm, we develop VLTVerse, a fine-grained evaluation framework that addresses diverse textual and scenario challenges by integrating existing VLT datasets into an expansive environmental space, E. VLTVerse provides an OPE mechanism with multiple metrics, M, enabling a comprehensive assessment of language function for VLT trackers, T. Utilizing VLTVerse, researchers can efficiently extract relevant subtasks, configure the environment, and select VLT trackers for performance evaluation.\nSimilar to SOTVerse [15], VLTVerse also allows researchers to define the task space through interaction and extension. Researchers can interactively retrieve data, set evaluation metrics, and analyze experimental outcomes. Through extensions, they can add new data or metrics to conduct detailed evaluations of tracker performance across varying tasks, focusing on the role of language.

For more data analysis of the selected datasets, please refer to Appendix A.4.\nThe representative datasets in VLTVerse include OTB99_Lang [26], TNL2K [38], LaSOT [3], and MGIT [14]. In VLTVerse, OTB99_Lang and TNL2K serve as representative datasets for short-term tracking. OTB99_Lang enhances each sequence with semantic information by providing a textual description for the first frame. TNL2K, designed specifically for VLT tasks, includes two thousand video sequences with diverse attributes, setting higher challenges for tracking performance compared to OTB99_Lang. LaSOT represents long-term tracking, where textual descriptions focus solely on object appearance, excluding positional information. Lastly, MGIT addresses global instance tracking by offering multi-level textual granularity for each sequence, thereby supporting a robust evaluation across various tracking scenarios."}, {"title": "4.2. Challenge Factor Selection", "content": "In the SOT task, addressing various challenge factors is essential for enhancing tracker performance and robustness. However, current VLT trackers often overlook this aspect. To address this gap, VLTVerse treats the influence of challenge factors in different contexts as a key observation point.\nSOTVerse [15] standardizes attribute calculations and defines challenge factors based on their distributions. Following this approach, we categorize attributes into two types: (1) static attributes, which pertain solely to the current frame, and (2) dynamic attributes, which capture changes between consecutive frames. The four static attributes ($C_1$-$c_4$) are Abnormal Ratio, Abnormal Scale, Blur Bounding-box, and Abnormal Illumination. The six dynamic attributes ($C_5$ - $C_{10}$) include Delta Illumination, Delta Scale, Delta Blur, Delta Ratio, Fast Motion, and Correlation Coefficient.\nWe calculate attribute values for each frame or between frames and then average them across the sequence to derive sequence-level attribute values. Sequences with values falling within specific challenge thresholds are classified as challenge factor sequences, forming the sequence-level challenge factor space detailed in Table 1.

Results for other metrics are available in Appendix B.3. The best results for each combination of challenge factors and semantic information are highlighted in Figure 5. From these figures, we can draw the following conclusions:\nInfluence of Challenging Factors. As shown in Figure 4 (a), the most challenging factors for VLT trackers are, in order, correlation coefficient, delta ratio, and fast motion, with the lowest average performance observed under these conditions. Conversely, all trackers perform best under abnormal ratio, abnormal scale, and abnormal illumination. This indicates that challenging factors related to dynamic attributes, such as fast motion and delta ratio, are particularly difficult for trackers to handle. This aligns with expectations, as dynamic challenges present significant obstacles to improving tracker performance from SOT to VLT, whereas static attributes generally pose less difficulty.\nInfluence of Textual Information Based on Challenging Factors.

However, for UVLTrack [27], performance differences are mostly negative, suggesting that meaningless text may interfere with tracking. This is likely due to UVLTrack's architecture, which uses unified parameters for SOT, VLT, and visual grounding tasks.

Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we introduce VLTVerse, a fine-grained evaluation framework that illuminates the role of language in VLT tasks. By expanding traditional evaluation methods, VLTVerse provides 60 unique combinations of 10 challenge factors and 6 semantic information types to assess VLT trackers. Using this framework, we perform an in-depth evaluation of three mainstream VLT trackers\u2014MMTrack, JointNLT, and UVLTrack\u2014identifying key performance bottlenecks associated with specific challenge factors and text types. Our analysis reveals which challenging factors most significantly impact tracker performance and robustness, as well as how varying text inputs can lead to performance fluctuations. For example, shorter texts benefit JointNLT due to its limited capacity for long text, while dense text supports MMTrack under blur conditions. Additionally, we find that certain trackers, such as UVLTrack, often perform well even with minimal text, highlighting room for optimizing text integration. We hope that VLTVerse provides actionable insights for improving VLT trackers from the perspectives of data, evaluation, and algorithm design, thereby advancing tracking robustness and accuracy."}]}

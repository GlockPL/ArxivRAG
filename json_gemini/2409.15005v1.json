The projects have varying prices, and the total cost of the selected projects cannot exceed a given budget. Voters express their preferences by casting ballots-typically either by indicating sets of approved projects (i.e., they cast approval ballots) or by assigning numerical scores to projects (so-called range voting). PB has been recently adopted by many municipalities worldwide,\u00b9 but the model applies more broadly. It extends the framework of committee elections [7, 8] and can be used even if the voters and candidates are not humans but represent abstract objects, such as validators in proof-of-stake blockchains [4].\nProportionality is a critical requirement in the context of PB elections. Intuitively, it says that each group of similar-minded voters should be entitled to decide about a proportional fraction of the available funds (e.g., if 30% of voters like similar projects, then roughly 30% of funds should be designated to the projects these voters support). Proportionality, among others, ensures equal treatment of minorities, geographical regions, and various project categories [6, 12]. It also ensures that groups of voters forming pluralities are not overrepresented, thus protecting elections against strategies employed by coordinated voters or project owners. As a result, several proportionality criteria and new voting rules have been proposed in the literature of Computational Social Choice (cf. the overview of Rey and Maly [12]).

This method selects the candidates by their vote count, omitting those whose selection would exceed the budget; it stops when no further candidate can be added. Since this approach is highly suboptimal from the perspective of proportionality (see for instance Example 1 that follows), we will be particularly interested in the Method of Equal Shares, a proportional election rule recently introduced in the literature [10, 11].\nMethod of Equal Shares Let bi be the virtual budget of voter vi; initially bi := b/n.

The procedure stops if there is no p-affordable candidate for any value of p.\nThe concept of p-affordability is crucial to our work. Intuitively, voters supporting a p-affordable\ncandidate c can cover its cost in such a way that each of them pays p per unit of utility or all of their\nremaining funds. In simpler terms, p represents the rate (price per unit of utility) at which the least\nadvantaged supporter of the project would \"purchase\u201d their satisfaction, if the project is selected.

Their costs and number of supporters are as follows:\nThe budget is b = $310,000 and assume cost utilities. The second group of 11 voters should intuitively be entitled to $(11/414 \u00b7 310,000) \u2248 $8,000. In fact, any rule that satisfies EJR must select Project B and so does Equal Shares. However, selecting Project B precludes the inclusion of Project A within the budget constraint. This is highly counterintuitive since it leaves a great majority of voters (over 97% of the electorate) empty handed, despite the fact that they commonly approve an affordable project. Thus, the Helenka Paradox serves not only as a critique of the Method of Equal Shares, but also of the prominent axiom of EJR itself.\nIn order to solve the indicated problem, additional strategies could be employed. Cities may compare the outcomes returned by the Method of Equal Shares and by the standard Utilitarian Method.

As a result, if Project A is selected, 99 voters will pay $0.0001 per unit of utility and 1 voter will pay $0.01 per unit of utility. In turn, for Project B, all voters will pay $0.005 per unit of utility. Thus, Project A is 1/100-affordable while Project B is 1/200-affordable. and the rule selects Project B, even though 99% of voters consider Project A as a much better option. This is because the Method of Equal Shares is in some sense egalitarian: when assessing the quality of a candidate, it essentially considers the utility assigned to the candidate by the least satisfied voter among those covering its cost.\nNote that the presented problem does not appear in approval elections. We observed this issue when applying Equal Shares to certain range voting committee elections."}, {"title": "Fractional Equal Shares", "content": "To develop intuitions required for the introduction of BOS Equal Shares, we first present Fractional Equal Shares (FrES)\u2014an adaptation of Equal Shares to fractional PB, where projects can be partially funded.

If we also fix y = 1 and ui(c) \u2208 {0, 1} for each voter vi and candidate c, we get the classic definition of EJR for the approval based committee voting setting [1].\nAdditionally, if applied to approval ballots with cost utilities, Definition 1 is equivalent to Cake EJR proposed by Bei et al. [2]. Fractional Equal Shares under approval ballots with cost utilities is equivalent to\nGeneralized Method of Equal Shares introduced by Lu et al. [9], who showed that it satisfies Cake EJR in\nsuch setting. In the following theorem, we generalize this result and show that FrES satisfies Fractional EJR\nunder arbitrary additive utilities.\nTheorem 1. FrES satisfies Fractional EJR.\nProof. Say that S is a (T, \u03b2, y)-cohesive set of voters, according to the definition of Fractional EJR.

We will put t = 0 for the initial values and no iteration number for the final values.\nObserve that in (B) and (C) the utility of all voters from S towards projects in T is strictly positive\nand no voters from S have budget constraint for these projects so at the end of those procedures each\nproject c from T will be bought up to \u1e9e(c). If at the end of (B) no voter vi from S has negative bi, then the\nsolution of (B) coincides with the solution of (A).

The Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending, in short, Bounded Overspending (BOS) can be viewed as a dependent rounding procedure for FrES, but also as a variant of Equal Shares, where voters may occasionally spend more than their initial entitlement.\nUnder the fractional rule, an a-fraction of a candidate can be purchased for a corresponding fraction of its cost; then each voter receives a proportional fraction of the utility. However, in the integral model,\nfractional purchases are not possible. In BOS, we simulate buying an a-fraction of a candidate, still assuming the voters gain fractions of utilities. However, the voters are now required to cover the full cost. The distribution of the payments is proportional to the one computed for the a-fraction. Specifically, for p satisfying:\na cost(c) = \u2211 min(bi, a \u2022 ui(c) \u00b7 p),\nVi\u2208V\na voter vi supporting c has to pay pi(c) = min(bi, a \u2022 ui(c) \u00b7 \u03c1)/\u03b1.

The method stops if no remaining candidate fits within the budget.\nNote that voters without money, including these that overspent before, do not have an impact on the further decisions. If only projects with p = +\u221e remain, which happens only if the supporters of the remaining projects have no money left, arbitrary projects that fit in the budget are added.\nWe provide a pseudo-code of Bounded Overspending in Algorithm 2 and we will now discuss it in the context of elections from Section 3."}, {"title": "BOS runs in polynomial time.", "content": "It is enough to argue that in each round, the next project can be selected in polynomial time.

Let S be the set of voters who\nstill have money left. Fix some not-yet-elected candidate c that has some supporters in S (otherwise, its p\nvalue equals +\u221e regardless of the a).

Note that\nfor the interval (a0, a1) all payments are proportional to their utilities, hence p is a constant and p/a is\nmaximized for a = a1.\nThis shows that the fraction a that minimizes p/a belongs to the set {a1, . . ., ap} \u222a {1}.

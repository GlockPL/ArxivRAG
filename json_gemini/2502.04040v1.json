Introduction", "content": "Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical research challenge, especially as they are increasingly used in applications like chat interfaces and productivity tools (OpenAI, 2022). This underscores the importance of safety alignment in post-training to ensure reliable and ethical model behavior across diverse scenarios. The most commonly used approach for safety alignment is Refusal Training (RT) (Bai et al., 2022; Llama Team, 2024), where the model is explicitly trained to respond to commonly illegal instructions (e.g., \u201cHow to build the bomb?"}, {"title": "2. Background and Related Work", "content": "Jailbreaking Attacks. OOD jailbreaking attacks aim to bypass the safety alignment, leading models to generate harmful contents. They can be classified into 2 classes: 1) white-box attacks (Zou et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023b; Geisler et al., 2024): the attackers access model parameters to compute gradients or losses; 2) black-box attacks (Chao et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2023a; Zeng et al., 2024): the attackers adopt black-box optimization or design diverse OOD scenarios to deceive models. Black-box attacks, which do not require access to models' parameters, are more practical and have demonstrated strong performance (Mazeika et al., 2024). Therefore, we mainly focuses on black-box attacks in this work.\nSafety Training. Various methods have been proposed to enhance generalization against OOD attacks, broadly classified into two categories: 1) regularization-based training (Yuan et al., 2024b; Qi et al., 2024), and 2) interventions in the model's internal representations (Zou et al., 2024; Sheshadri et al., 2024). In contrast to these methods, we introduce a new supervision signal\u2014reasoning data\u2014derived from our analysis to train the model.\nOOD Generalization Kumar et al. (2022) shows that fine-tuning with limited samples distorts pretrained features, resulting in poor OOD performance. Izmailov et al. (2022); Lee et al. (2022) further explore this issue, showing that underspecified supervision can lead pretrained models to rely on shortcuts in training data during fine-tuning. Aligning with this line of research, we propose training models to elicit and utilize latent knowledge through reasoning as a strategy to mitigate these limitations.\nLLM Reasoning. Reasoning has enabled LLMs to achieve exceptional performance in STEM tasks. Training models to reason falls into two main approaches: 1) using human-curated or synthesized supervision, and 2) scaling reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit reasoning abilities. The first approach obtains high-quality supervision from human annotations (Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023), distillation from stronger LLMs (Yu et al., 2023; Mitra et al., 2024), or self-distillation (Zelikman et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2024b; Guan et al., 2025). The second approach employs large-scale RL to incentivize reasoning, leading to the emergence of intriguing reasoning behaviors and better performance (OpenAI, 2024; Guo et al., 2025). Our method follows the first approach. While Guan et al. (2024) also train models to reason for safety alignment, our work places greater emphasis on analyzing failure mode of refusal training and proposes a complete pipeline for synthesizing reasoning supervision based on these insights.\nPreliminaries. Let (x, y) ~ DT be a training sample, where (xi, Yi) denotes an illegal instruction with its direct refusal, and (xh, yh) represents a helpful sample. The trained model is denoted as Me."}, {"title": "3. Re-Examining OOD Generalization of Refusal Training", "content": "In this section, we re-examine the generalization performance of Refusal Training (RT) to investigate Do OOD jailbreaking attacks truly exceed the capability of RT model, or does the model simply fail to effectively leverage their learned pretraining knowledge about safety to handle OOD cases? Inspired by prior works (Gao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024), we adopt a relaxed evaluation approach to assess ASR. Specifically, instead of relying on greedy decoding, we use Best-of-N sampling (BoN) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation on RT.\nWe adopt the widely used LLaMA-3.1-8B-base as Me. For training dataset, we incorporate illegal instructions (e.g., \"How to build a bomb?\") from PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024) and helpful instructions from Ultrafeedback (Cui et al., 2023). We resample corresponding responses from GPT-40. We use two training dataset scales: 1) small-scale, consisting of 0.8K randomly selected illegal instructions and 2.5K helpful instructions; and 2) large-scale, containing 5K illegal instructions and 30K helpful instructions. Following previous work (Touvron et al., 2023a; Llama Team,"}, {"title": "3.1. Refusal-Trained Model Could Achieves Better ASR against OOD Attacks", "content": "For BoN sampling, we set the temperature T = 1 and scale N from 4 to 128. The results are shown in Figure 1. When evaluated with greedy decoding (N = 0), the model performs good generalization performance on ID attacks (first column), even when trained on small-scale datasets. This observation aligns with findings from previous studies (Bianchi et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024b; Touvron et al., 2023b). In contrast, it shows poor generalization performance against OOD attacks (second to fifth columns)."}, {"title": "3.2. Further Analysis Based on Domain Adaptation", "content": "Refusal Training compels the model to directly respond to illegal instructions \u00e6i with simple refusal phrases yi, such as \"I'm sorry...\". This straightforward pattern-matching approach allows the model to quickly learn refusal behavior, yielding strong performance on ID attacks even with small-scale datasets, as mentioned above. However, this overly simplistic and easily learnable supervision signal also hinders the model from leveraging its rich pretraining knowledge, causing it to rely on superficial shortcuts within the training data when handling OOD attacks.\nTo better understand this issue, we draw an connection to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). In this view, generalizing safety to OOD attacks resembles the UDA task, where the tested attacks (target domain) come from a distribution distinct from the training dataset (source domain). We use the following classic expression (informal version) (Ben-David et al., 2006) to characterize the model's performance on the target domain:\n$E_{test}(M_o) \\leq E_{train}(M_o) + d_{M_o}(P_{train}, P_{test}) + \\lambda$,\nwhere e is error (ASR in our work). \u03bb is irreducible error term, which is related to the hypothesis space of Me. $d_{M_o}$ measures a pre-defined divergence between $P_{train}$ and $P_{test}$ in the representation space learned by Me. This error bound indicates that effective training on the source domain, coupled with learning a robust and distribution-aligned representation space, is essential for enhancing OOD performance. To reduce the first term $E_{train}(M_o)$, we can adopt to increase training dataset size, as shown in Figure 1.\nTo analyze the second term do, we utilize Representation Engineering (RepE) (Zou et al., 2023a), a widely used technique for interpreting and controlling internal representations of LLMs, to visualize the learned"}, {"title": "4. Eliciting and Utilizing Latent Knowledge via Learning to Reason with Guidelines", "content": "To encourage the model to effectively elicit and utilize its latent knowledge when addressing various OOD scenarios, we train it to engage in step-by-step reasoning for each query before generating final response. Unlike merely imitating simplistic direct refusal behaviors, reasoning supervision encourages the model to perform more computations for each query, explicitly eliciting and utilizing its latent knowledge through reasoning to reach the final response. It enables the model to adaptively handle various OOD cases during testing, rather than relying on simple pattern matching, thereby achieving better OOD generalization. To achieve this goal, we propose a method to teach model to perform safety reasoning. It incorporates three essential components: synthesizing supervision based on guidelines, rejection sampling aligned with guidelines, and internalizing guidelines with context distillation. We refer to our method as Safety Reasoning with Guidelines (SRG).\nSynthesizing Reasoning Supervision Based on Guidelines. We first synthesize supervision by prompting an LLM Mt to generate reasoning responses that adhere to pre-defined guidelines, ci ~ C. Each guideline corresponds to a specific aspect of safety-related latent knowledge about input query, such as reasoning patterns (e.g., \u201cencouraging"}, {"title": "5. Experiments", "content": "5.1. Experimental Settings\nModels. We mainly use LLaMA-3.1-8B-base and 70B-base as Me. We also adopt our method in other models. Due to limited space, we show the results in Appendix C.2. We adopt GPT-40 (Achiam et al., 2023) as Mt. For M and M, we use LLaMA-3.1-8B-instruct and Llama-Guard-3, respectively.\nDatasets. We use illegal instructions from PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024) and helpful instructions from Ultrafeedback (Cui et al., 2023). We resample corresponding responses from GPT-40. We adopt two dataset scales: 1) small-scale (0.8K illegal, 2.5K helpful) and 2) large-scale (5K illegal, 30K helpful).\nTraining Settings. We use full-parameter SFT for the 8B model and LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) for the 70B model. More details are shown in Appendix A.2.\nBaseline. We compare our method SRG with refusal training and the state-of-the-art safety training approaches, LAT (Sheshadri et al., 2024) and RR (Zou et al., 2024). For refusal training, we use the same illegal instructions (without guidelines) and corresponding refusal (resampled from GPT-40) to train Me. For comparision with LAT and RR, we directly utilize their provided checkpoints. To ensure a fair comparison, we implement our method on LLaMA-3-8B-instruct, aligning with the model setups used in these studies. More details on the setting are shown in Appendix A.3.\nEvaluation Tasks. We evaluate six attacks: 1) an ID attack, illegal instructions from Do-Not Answer (Wang et al., 2023) and HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), and 2) five OOD attacks: JailbreakingChat (Shen et al., 2024), Self-Cipher (Yuan et al., 2023a), PastTense (Andriushchenko &"}, {"title": "5.2.

Notably, for JailbreakChat and SelfCipher, SRG achieves ASR close to 0%. While we only include \"reasoning pattens\" into our guidelines to elicit knowledge, our method still demonstrates promising OOD generalization. PastTense and PersuasiveAttack correspond to \"historical context\" aspect and \u201cuser intent recognition\" aspect about context understanding knowledge.

To address this, we introduce a corresponding guideline before queries at inference time (shown in Appendix E).

The result is presented in the final subfigure of Figure 2. Almost all attacks are clearly separable from helpful instructions, with the representation distributions of both types of attacks more closely aligned (indicating a smaller $d_{M_o}(P_{train}, P_{test})$ ).

Conclusion and Limitations", "content": "In this work, we analyze the reasons why the commonly used Refusal Training fails to generalize against OOD attacks and provide explanations for these failure modes.

Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our method.\nFor simplicity, we use only reasoning patterns as C to elicit latent knowledge in this work. As a result, our method has yet to match the performance of state-of-the-art safety training approaches on certain OOD attacks. However, our evaluation on PAIR demonstrates that incorporating additional relevant guidelines can further reduce ASR for OOD attacks. We plan to explore this direction further in future work. Due to computation cost, we only conduct SFT to train model. However, as shown in our experiments, BoN yields substantial improvements. We believe that integrating RL training methods, such as DPO, could further enhance performance of our method."}, {"title": "Impact Statement", "content": "Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical research challenge, especially as they become increasingly embedded in real-world applications such as chat interfaces, virtual assistants, and productivity tools.

Experiments", "content": "A.1. Models, Datasets, Evaluations\nModels Following previous safety training method (Qi et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024a), we utilize models of varying sizes.\n\u2022 We adopt pretrained LLM: LLaMA-3.1-8B (Llama Team, 2024), LLaMA-3.1-70B (Llama Team, 2024), Gemma-2-9B (Team et al., 2024), Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023), Qwen2-7B (Bai et al., 2023) as base LLM.\n\u2022 For Teacher LLM, we adopt GPT-40 (Achiam et al., 2023).\n\u2022 For evaluation, we adopt LLaMA-Guard-3-8B (Llama Team, 2024).\n\u2022 We use abbreviations to substitute for the full names of the models. For example, when we report results on LLaMA-3.1-70B with Lora Finetuning, we substitute it as L3.1-70B-Lora; when on LLaMA-3.1-8B with Full Finetuning, we regard it as L3.1-8B-Full; similarly, LLaMA-3.1-70B Lora Baseline will be represented as L3.1-70B-LoraBaseline.\nDatasets We use queries from PKU-SafeRLHF (Ji et al., 2024) and Ultrafeedback (Cui et al., 2023) as harmless and helpful training queries.\n\u2022 PKU-SafeRLHF is a high-quality dataset containing 83.4K preference entries, annotated across two key dimensions: harmlessness and helpfulness. Each entry includes two responses to a question, along with safety meta-labels and preferences based on the responses' helpfulness and harmlessness. From this dataset, we randomly extract 5K illegal questions for the large-scale setting and 0.8K illegal questions for the small-scale setting. To ensure the extracted questions are genuinely harmful, we conduct both human evaluations and evaluations using LLaMA-Guard-3-8B.\n\u2022 Ultrafeedback is a large-scale, fine-grained, and diverse preference dataset comprising 64K prompts from various sources, including UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023) and Evol-Instruct (Xu et al., 2023), etc. From this dataset, we randomly extract 30K helpful questions for the large-scale setting and 2.5K helpful questions for the small-scale setting. To ensure the extracted dataset does not contain toxic questions, we filter it using LLaMA-Guard-3-8B.\nEvaluation Tasks We use both ID and OOD attacks to assess safety performance. The evaluation includes six types of tasks: (1) 200 illegal instructions from Do-Not Answer (Wang et al., 2023) and HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) (ID attack); (2) 200 JailbreakChat instructions from Do-Anything-Now (Shen et al., 2024) and DeRTa (Yuan et al., 2024a) (OOD attack); (3) 200 SelfCipher instructions from Yuan et al. (2023a) (OOD attack); (4) 100 PastTense attack instructions from Andriushchenko & Flammarion (2024) (OOD attack); (5) 50 Persuasive Jailbreaker attack instructions from Zeng et al. (2024) (OOD attack); and (6) 50 black-box attacks from PAIR (Chao et al., 2023).\nFor helpfulness evaluation, we use HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) to assess coding ability, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) for math reasoning ability, and BFCL (Yan et al., 2024) for tool usage evaluation. The specific details are as follows.\n\u2022 We randomly sampled 100 harmful questions from the Do-Not-Answer dataset and an additional 100 from HarmBench, resulting in a total of 200 illegal instructions. Do-Not-Answer is an open-source dataset designed to evaluate the safety mechanisms of LLMs, containing 939 instructions spanning five risk areas and 12 harm types. HarmBench is a standardized evaluation framework for automated red teaming, comprising 400 illegal instructions.\n\u2022 For JailbreakingChat evaluation, we collect top 50 jailbreakchat methods from Jailbreak Website (Walkerspider, 2022), ranked by user votes. Then, these 50 methods are randomly utilized on the former illegal instructions, resulting in 200 jailbreak chat tasks.\n\u2022 We conduct Self Cipher attacks (Yuan et al., 2023a) on the previously collected 200 illegal instructions. Self Cipher utilizes role-playing and few-shot techniques to jailbreak LLMs, tricking the model into believing the communication is in cipher while simultaneously introducing malicious question-answer pairs.\n\u2022 PastTense attack reformulates illegal instructions into past tense, making the target LLM more inclined to generate historical content that could lead to potential misuse in practice. Following Andriushchenko & Flammarion (2024), we include 100 past tense illegal instructions as evaluation questions.\n\u2022 Persuasive attack typically constructs simulated or fictional scenarios to make the target LLM more likely to produce toxic content.

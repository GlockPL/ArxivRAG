Despite these breakthroughs, the application of ML to spectroscopy-hereafter referred to as Spectroscopy Machine Learning (SpectraML) [19, 61]-remains relatively underexplored. Spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques, which provide high-sensitivity insights into molecular structure, dynamics, and properties, are now generating large volumes of data due to advances in high-throughput experiments and automated acquisition. Consequently, traditional manual analysis methods, reliant on expert interpretation and reference libraries [3, 84], are increasingly inadequate for handling the scale and complexity of modern spectral datasets.\nThe growing interest in this field is reflected in the increasing number of research papers that expand the scope of tasks addressed by spectrum-based ML models [23, 3, 31, 8]. However, existing overviews often focus on a single modality (e.g., UV alone or MS) [4] or lack a clear framework for distinguishing forward (molecule-to-spectrum) from inverse (spectrum-to-molecule) tasks [66]. By contrast, our survey unifies five major spectroscopic techniques-MS, NMR, IR, Raman, and UV-Vis-within a single methodological framework. Moreover, we highlight the rapid progression of spectroscopic analysis driven by ML advances in generative modeling, few- or zero-shot learning, and large-scale pretraining, and we provide an open-source repository of datasets and code.

Our discussion is organized around four core components. We begin by examining the data representations and preprocessing strategies that serve as the foundation for effective spectral modeling. We then focus on the forward problem of predicting spectral signatures from molecular structures, followed by a discussion of the inverse problem of inferring molecular structures from spectral data. Finally, we describe emerging unified frameworks and cross-modal integration approaches that promise to address both challenges simultaneously. A summary of the discussed work is presented in Table 1."}, {"title": "3.1 Data Representations and Preprocessing", "content": "The quality of spectral analysis is fundamentally determined by how both molecular and spectral data are represented and preprocessed. In SpectraML, spectral data may be expressed as vectors, sequences, or images, while molecular structures are encoded using vector-based descriptors, SMILES strings, 2D graphs, or 3D coordinates. Such diverse representations are essential for capturing the intricate details of molecular interactions. However, the high-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of spectral data, combined with challenges such as noise, baseline drift, and instrument variability, demands robust preprocessing pipelines. Early work demonstrated that conventional normalization and alignment techniques were insufficient for fully preserving the chemical information embedded in these datasets. Recent studies, including those by [25] and [27], have underscored the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge-such as physics-informed normalization and tailored feature extraction into the preprocessing stage. More recent work, such as [2, 3], is building a large-scale spectral dataset and harnessing the power of transformer-based models to map the latent representations of spectral data, thereby paving the way for robust and generalizable spectral analysis frameworks. These advances ensure that the learned representations are both resilient to experimental artifacts and chemically meaningful, thereby establishing a strong foundation for addressing both forward and inverse tasks."}, {"title": "3.2 Forward Problem: Molecule-to-Spectrum", "content": "The forward problem in SpectraML aims at predicting spectral information directly from known molecular structures, serving as an efficient alternative to computationally expensive quantum-chemical simulations and laborious experimental measurements. Forward-problem can also be extended to extract critical spectral features and related chemical properties. Therefore, the input of these ML-empowered solutions consists of molecules represented in different forms, such as SMILES strings, molecular graphs, or three-dimensional coordinates. The output can be either full spectra across different modalities (MS, NMR, IR, Raman, UV-Vis) or specific spectral features and chemical properties relevant to the target application. These ML approaches typically adopt an encoding-prediction framework, which predicts spectral features or related chemical properties in forms of regression or classification. In such architectures, the encoder transforms the molecular structure into a latent feature space that captures its essential chemical characteristics. The subsequent prediction stage then leverages this representation to predict partial spectra or specific spectral properties, depending on the target modality. While encoding and prediction are often implemented and trained end-to-end within a single model, without a strict separation (as demonstrated in example tasks D and E in Fig. 2), we structure the following discussion of related work based on the various forms of input and output involved in these problems, as they directly influence the selection and design of applicable machine learning models."}, {"title": "3.3 Inverse Problem: Spectrum-to-Molecule", "content": "The inverse problem in spectral analysis aims at inferring a molecular structure directly from its measured spectrum, providing a complementary approach to traditional structure elucidation methods. In this task, the input consists of spectral measurements that can vary widely, from one-dimensional NMR signals and high-dimensional spectral vectors to image-like two-dimensional matrices (e.g., from NMR or IR) and sequential data from mass spectrometry (MS). The output is the predicted molecular structure, commonly represented as a molecular graph or an SMILES string. ML approaches to the inverse problem typically adopt either an encoding-decoding scheme, where the spectral data is transformed into a latent representation and then decoded into a molecular structure"}, {"title": "3.4 Unified Frameworks and Cross-Modal Integration", "content": "Recognizing that forward and inverse problems share common underlying chemical principles, recent research has begun to develop unified frameworks capable of addressing both tasks concurrently. Foundation models pre-trained on large, heterogeneous spectral datasets are at the forefront of this endeavor. These models leverage cross-domain learning to capture shared features across diverse modalities, such as IR, NMR, MS, and Raman-thereby enabling few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities [7]. Concurrently, physics-informed generative models, including diffusion models and GAN-based super-resolution techniques, have been introduced to synthesize high-fidelity spectra while respecting known chemical constraints [16]. Hybrid architectures that combine the relational modeling strength of GNNs with the sequence modeling capabilities of transformers offer a particularly promising route toward integrated spectrum analysis [80]. Moreover, foundation models are steering the advancement"}, {"title": "4 Challenges and Opportunities", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Data Quality, Scarcity, and Complexity", "content": "SpectraML faces several interrelated challenges arising from the inherent nature of experimental spectral data and the limitations of current ML approaches. First, the variability in data quality is a significant obstacle. Experimental spectra are often compromised by noise, baseline drifts, and instrument-to-instrument discrepancies, leading to inconsistencies in spectral resolution and intensity. Such variability complicates model training and can severely degrade the predictive performance of ML algorithms-especially when preprocessing pipelines are insufficiently robust. Moreover, the scarcity and imbalance of high-quality, annotated spectral datasets, particularly for rare or complex compounds, further exacerbate the issue. The limited availability of training data not only hinders the generalization of models across diverse chemical spaces but also increases the risk of overfitting, necessitating strategies such as data augmentation and transfer learning.\nIn addition to data quality challenges, the intrinsic complexity of spectral data presents a formidable hurdle. Spectral measurements typically exhibit high dimensionality and overlapping peaks, making feature extraction a non-trivial task. Current ML models often struggle to capture the nuanced, high-dimensional patterns inherent in such data, which leads to suboptimal performance in tasks like peak detection and feature discrimination. Furthermore, many existing architectures are not designed to fully leverage the domain knowledge embedded in spectroscopic data, thereby limiting their ability to exploit underlying chemical and physical principles.\nA further challenge arises from the need to integrate data from multiple spectroscopic techniques (e.g., IR, MS, and NMR), each characterized by distinct scales, formats, and noise properties. Developing effective fusion strategies to reconcile these differences into a unified model is nontrivial. Most current ML architectures are optimized for single-modality inputs and often fail to capture the critical cross-domain relationships needed for accurate spectral analysis. Additionally, achieving model interpretability-so as to provide meaningful insights into the underlying chemical phenomena\u2013requires a careful balance between model complexity and transparency. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the state of SpectraML and ensuring that ML-driven approaches can fully harness the rich information contained in spectral data."}, {"title": "4.2 Opportunities and Emerging Paradigms", "content": "Synthetic Data Generation and Physics-Informed Methods. One promising avenue to overcome the challenges posed by scarce and variable spectral data is advanced data augmentation using AI-driven generative models [75]. State-of-the-art approaches, like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, enable effective application in many downstream tasks [12, 32, 11, 10, 37]. They can learn complex, high-dimensional data distributions from experimental spectra [54, 8]. Once trained, these models can rapidly generate synthetic spectra that replicate the overall shape and key features of real data, while also capturing subtle nonlinear relationships that traditional simulation methods may overlook [2, 3]. This capability is particularly valuable in SpectraML, where limited annotated datasets and the high cost of experimental measurements hinder robust model training.\nMoreover, incorporating physics-based priors into these generative frameworks can significantly enhance the chemical validity and interpretability of the synthetic spectra. By embedding domain-specific constraints-such as conservation laws, known peak intensity ratios, and chemical shift rules-into the generative process, the models are guided to produce outputs that adhere to established physical and chemical principles. This hybrid approach not only mitigates data scarcity by rapidly generating high-fidelity synthetic data but also offers computational advantages over conventional methods like density functional theory (DFT) or molecular dynamics simulations. Consequently, these advancements have the potential to accelerate discovery and innovation in fields ranging from drug development to materials science.\nFoundation Models: A New Paradigm for SpectralML. Foundationmodels [7, 57] represent a transformative opportunity in spectral analysis by being pre-trained on extensive, heterogeneous datasets that span multiple modalities (e.g., IR, NMR, MS, and Raman). These models leverage cross-domain learning to capture both global chemical phenomena and local spectral details, enabling few-shot and zero-shot learning to rapidly adapt to tasks such as spectral generation, peak prediction, and structure elucidation. Their ability to handle both forward and inverse tasks, coupled with the integration of domain-specific priors like conservation laws and chemical shift rules, paves the way for unified analytical frameworks built on robust pre-training data and carefully tailored model architectures.\nThe advanced reasoning capabilities inherent in foundation models further enhance spectral analysis by enabling multi-step inference and hypothesis generation that effectively address ambiguous or overlapping spectral features. By integrating information across multiple spectral modalities, the models can construct a holistic view of"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "The SpectraML establishes a crucial intersection between machine learning and spectroscopy.

The spectrum is usually presented as a vertical bar graph, in which each bar on the x-axis represents an ion that has a specific mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) and the length of the bar indicates the relative abundance of the ion on the y-axis. The peak with the highest $m/z$ value is called the molecular ion (M), which gives the molecular mass of a compound. The peaks with smaller $m/z$ values are called fragment ion peaks, which are the charged fragments of the molecular ion (M). The tallest peak is called the base peak because it has the greatest relative abundance as a stable charged fragment. The base peak is assigned a relative abundance of 100%, and the relative abundance of each of the other peaks is shown as a percentage of the base peak. The mass spectrometer records all the relative abundance of each fragments plotted against its $m/z$ value into an MS spectrum."}, {"title": "6.2 Infrared (IR) and Raman spectrum", "content": "An IR and the related Raman spectra probe the vibrations along bonds, angles and torsions in a molecule through their interactions with electromagnetic radiation in the range of 4000\u2013600 cm-\u00b9. The results are presented as a line graph of the percent transmission of radiation on the y-axis and the wavenumber (or wavelength) of the radiation transmitted on the x-axis. At 100% transmission all the energy of the radiation of a particular wavelength passes through the molecule. Lower values of percentage transmission mean that some of the energy is being absorbed by the compound. Each downward spikes (called bands or peaks) in the spectrum represents the absorption of energy. A Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectrophotometer measures all frequencies simultaneously. This allows for multiple measurements of the sample, which are then averaged. The information is then digitized and Fourier transformed by a computer to produce the final FT-IR spectrum. Within the IR/Raman spectrum, there are two major distinguishable areas. The area on the left (4000\u20131400 cm\u00af\u00b9) is where most functional groups show absorption bands, called the functional group region because these vibrations are highly localized and specific for certain functional groups. The area on the right (1400\u2013600 cm\u00af\u00b9) is called the fingerprint region because it is characteristic of the compound as a whole. The main IR analysis is on the functional group region, while the fingerprint region is hard to interpret but can be used to match the structure of a compound to a known reference spectrum."}, {"title": "6.3 UV-Vis spectrum", "content": "A UV-Vis spectrum measures electronic transition in a molecule, a molecule absorbs either ultraviolet (180-400 nm wavelength) or visible light (400-780 nm wavelength). It is presented as a graph of absorbance, optical density or transmittance on the y-axis as a function of wavelength on the x-axis. This spectroscopy provides information about compounds that have conjugated double bonds, because double bonds have molecular orbitals that can potentially absorb the applied energy."}, {"title": "6.4 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra", "content": "NMR data provides information on certain nuclei, including the hydrogen and carbon atoms that make up most organic molecules. To record an NMR spectrum, a sammple is introduced in a constant, strong magnetic field and an electromagnetic pulse of short duration covers a range of frequencies in the range of 60-900 MHz. Each nucleus of a compound sample can absorb the frequency it requires to come into resonance and produce a signal called a free induction decay (FID) at a frequency corresponding to the change in energy. The intensity of the FID signal decays as the nuclei loose energy they gained from an rf pulse. A computer then measures the change in intensity over time and converts it using a mathematical operation known as Fourier transform to produce a Fourier transform NMR (FT-NMR) spectrum. This is the final NMR spectrum that is then observed and analyzed by experimentalists and reported in publications and databases. The advantage of NMR spectroscopy over the other instrumental techniques is that it not only identifies the functionality at a specific carbon, but it also enables to obtain information about the connectivity of neighboring carbons. Hence, NMR spectra are much more diverse and complex. First, the spectrum can be in multiple dimensions, indicating the interaction between multiple (1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D-NMR). Secondly, NMR can represent different atomic nuclei. Some elements have a property called nuclear spin that allows them to be studied by NMR such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, and"}]}

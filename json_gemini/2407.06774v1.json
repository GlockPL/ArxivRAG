The most widely used fuzzy clustering algorithm is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm proposed by Bezdek [1]. The algorithm, however, requires a pre-defined number of clusters (c) by a user. Different selections on the initial number of clusters result in different clustering partitions. Thus, it is necessary to validate each of the fuzzy c-partitions once they are found. This evaluation is called cluster validity. Many fuzzy cluster validity indexes have been proposed in the literature [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Bezdek's partition coefficient (PC) [2], partition entropy (PE) [3], and Xie-Beni's index [5] have been frequently used in current research. In this paper, a new cluster validity index for fuzzy clustering is proposed. The proposed index evaluates the fuzzy cluster partitions based on a proximity relation between fuzzy clusters. The proximity value is both the degree of overlapping and the inverse distance of separation between the clusters. Thus, a smaller proximity value indicates a lower degree of overlapping and farther separation between the clusters, which results in well-partitioned fuzzy clusters."}, {"title": "2 PREVIOUS WORK", "content": "The FCM clustering algorithm has been widely used to obtain the fuzzy c-partition. However, the algorithm may fall into local optima due to the initial selection of cluster centroids. Most of the clustering algorithms take a random generation to the initial selection method, which result in the fact that different selections on the initial cluster centroids cause different clustering partitions. Thus, an evaluation methodology was required to validate each of the fuzzy c-partitions once they are found. This evaluation is called cluster validity. In addition, a cluster validity can help to find out the optimal number of clusters (c) when the number of clusters is not known in a priori [8].\nThe objective of the FCM is to obtain the fuzzy c-partition F = {F1,F2, .., Fc } for both an unlabeled data set X = {x1,...,xn} and the number of clusters c by minimizing the evaluation function Jm:\n\\[minimize Jm (U,V : X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(u_{ij})^{m} ||xj - vi||2\\qquad(1)\\]\nwhere uij is the membership degree of data xj to a fuzzy cluster set F\u2081, and also, is an element of a (c \u00d7 n) pattern matrix U = [\u00b5ij]. V = (V1, V2, .., ve) is a vector of cluster centers of the fuzzy c-partition F. ||xj \u2013 vi||2 is an Euclidean norm between xj and vi. The parameter m controls the fuzziness of membership of each data. Most of fuzzy clustering algorithms are performed using m = 2 because it gives better performance results than other m values [4].\nBezkek proposed two cluster validity indexes for fuzzy clustering [2][3]: Partition Coefficient (VPC) and Partition Entropy (VPE). Equation 2 shows that Vpc takes its maximum as an optimal partition, and VPE takes its unique minimum as the best one.\n\\[V_{PC} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{c} \\mu_{ij}^{2}}{n} \\qquad V_{PE} = -\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{c} [Mij loga(Mij)]}{n}\\qquad(2)\\]\nXie and Beni proposed a validity index VXB that focused on two concepts: compactness and separation [5]. The numerator part of equation 3 indicates the compactness of fuzzy partition. The denominator part explains the level of separation between clusters. Fukuyama and Sugeno also tried to model the cluster validation VFs by exploiting both the compactness of cluster and the distance from each cluster centroid in equation 4 [6]. Kwon extended the Xie and Beni's index to eliminate its monotonic decreasing tendency [7].\n\\[V_{XB} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{c} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mu_{ij}^{2}||xj - vi||2}{n(min_{i\\neq k} ||vi - vk||2)}\\qquad(3)\\]\n\\[V_{FS} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{c} \\mu_{ij}^{2} (||xk - vi|| - ||Vi - \\overline{x}||)\\qquad(4)\\]\n\\[VK = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{c} \\mu_{ij}^{2}||xj - vi||\u00b2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{c} || vi - \\overline{x}||2}{min_{i\\neq k} || Vi - Vk ||2}\\qquad(5)\\]\nMore recent indexes in cluster validation are associated with the degree of variance in each cluster. Rezaee combined the within-cluster variance with the distance functional [8]. In equation 6, VCwB, \u03c3(vi) indicates the fuzzy variance of the i-th cluster, and \u03c3(X) means the variance of the pattern set X. Boudraa also suggested to take the cluster variance into consideration for the validity index VBcrit [9].\n\\[V_{CWB} \\alpha \\frac{1}{c} [\\frac{||\\sigma(vi)||}{||\\sigma(X)||} + \\frac{Dmax}{Dmin}] \\sum_{k=1}^{c} \\sum_{z=1}^{k-1} ||vi - vj||^{2} \\qquad(6)\\]\n\\[VB crit = \\frac{max_{i\\neq j} \\delta(vi, vj)}{min_{i\\neq j} \\delta(vi,vj)} + \\alpha\\frac{\\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{q=1}^{C} var(q)}{\\sum_{q=1}^{P} var(q)}\\qquad(7)\\]"}, {"title": "3 PROPOSED CLUSTER VALIDITY MEASURE", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Motivation and intuition", "content": "In this paper, a new cluster validity index for the FCM is proposed. The key concept is to exploit the geometric properties of fuzzy clusters. All the previous indexes including VPC and VPE focused on only the compactness and the variation of within-cluster. Some indexes such as VXB and VCWB have used the strength of separation between clusters in order to account for an inter-cluster structural information. However, those indexes are limited in their ability to provide a meaningful interpretation of structure in the data since the separation is simply computed by considering only the distance between cluster centroids.\nFigure 1 shows an example of how the traditional indexes are limited in their ability to recognize the correct difference between clusters. There are two different fuzzy partitions (U(a), V(a)) and (U(b), V(b)) containing the same separation distance between cluster centroids. Two fuzzy clusters Fa), F(a) \u2208 U(a) have their centroids via), vaa) \u2208 V(a) respectively in figure 1(a). In figure 1(b), two fuzzy clusters F(b), F(b) \u2208 U(b) have their own centroids vp),vb) vp, \u2208 V(b), respectively. We find that (U(a), V(a)) is better separated than (U(b), V(b)) because a large number of data xj \u2208 X are more clearly classified in (U(a), V(a)). However, with the conventional indexes, it is difficult to tell which partition of the two is better in viewpoints of isolation"}, {"title": "3.2 Validity index using inter-cluster proximity", "content": "With each fuzzy cluster F\u2081 = \\sum_{j=1}^{'}\\mu_{i}(xj)/xj = \u03bc\u6237;(x1)/x1 + M\u1ef9; (x2)/X2 + ... + \u03bcf(xn)/xn, we obtain the proximity value between two fuzzy clusters at each point of membership degree (u) before computing the total inter-cluster proximity. The proximity function f(u) at a given membership degree u between two fuzzy clusters F, and Fq is defined as:\n\\[f(\\mu: Fp, F\u2084) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\delta(xj,\\mu : Fp,Fq)w(xj)\\qquad(9)\\]\nwhere\n\\[\\delta(xj,\\mu: Fp,Fq) = \\begin{cases}\n1.0 & \\text{if } \\mu \\leq MIN(\\mu_{F_p}(xj), \\mu_{F_q}(xj))\\\\\n0.0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\qquad(10)\\]\n\u03b4(xj,\u00b5: Fp,Fq) determines whether two clusters are proximate at the membership degree u for data xj. It returns that proximity is 1.0 when both membership degrees of the two clusters are more than u; otherwise, it returns 0.0. Furthermore, w(xj) is introduced to assign a weight for vague data. The weight value of w(xj) \u2208 [0.0, 1.0] is determined by the degree of sharing of data xj between clusters. Vague data are given more weight than clearly classified data. For example, w(xj) is given a value within [0.7,1.0] when xj is considered vague such that up; (xj) \u2264 0.5 for all F; \u2208 F. Conversely, w(xj) is given a weight within [0.0,0.3] when xj is clearly classified as belonging to one of the clusters such that \u03bc\u0113; (xj) \u2265 0.8 for any F\u012f \u2208 F. This approach makes it possible for us to focus more concentration on the highly-overlapped vague data in the computation of the validity index than other indexes do.\nFigure 2 represents two proximity values f (u) at membership degree u between two fuzzy clusters. Two fuzzy partitions U(a) and U(b) were shown in the figure. In the figure 2(a), among all xj \u2208 X, only xj \u2208 r are given a value 1.0 by equation 10. Given the weight function w(x), proximity f (\u00b5 : F(a), F(a)) is obtained by aggregating the product of 8(xj,\u00b5 : Fla), (a), F(a)) F(a)) and w(x) for all xj \u2208 X by equation 9. When we compare two proximity values f(u) for the partitions U(a) and U(b), the f(u: F(a), F(a)) F(a), F(a)) is given more higher value than f(\u00b5 : F(b), F(b)). The number of overlapped data xj \u2208 r in the partition U(a) is more than in U(b), which indicates that the partition U(a) has much more vague data than U(b). Thus, we can see that the partition U(b) with a lower f(u) is a better partition than U(a) with a higher f(\u03bc).\nDefinition 1 (Inter-cluster proximity) Let Fp and Fq be two fuzzy clusters belonging to a pattern matrix U. Let f(\u00b5 : Fp,Fq) be a proximity function at a given membership degree \u00b5 between Fp and Fq. Then, a total inter-cluster proximity S(Fp, Fq) between Fp and Fq is defined as\n\\[S(Fp, F\u2084) = \\sum_{\\mu}.f(\\mu: Fp,Fq) = \\sum_{\\mu}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\delta(xj,\\mu: Fp,Fq)w(xj)\\qquad(11)\\]\nS(Fp, Fq) is obtained by calculating the f (u : Fp, Fq) for the whole range of membership degrees. A small value for S(Fp,Fq) indicates that Fp has little proximity to Fq, which results in a well-separated partition between the two clusters. With the above proximity definition for the two fuzzy clusters, we establish a new cluster validity index for fuzzy clustering.\nDefinition 2 (Proposed validity index) Let Fp and Fq be two fuzzy clusters belonging to a pattern matrix U. Let S(Fp,Fq) be the inter-cluster proximity between Fp and Fq. Let the number of clusters and the computation number for the proximity between the fuzzy clusters be denoted by c and C2, respectively. Then, the proposed validity index Vproposed(U,V : X) is defined as\n\\[V_{proposed} (U,V : X) = \\frac{2}{\\frac{c}{2}} \\sum_{p=1}^{C} \\sum_{q=1}^{C} S(Fp, F\u2084)\\qquad(12)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{2}{c(c-1)} \\sum_{p=1}^{C} \\sum_{q=1}^{C} [\\sum_{\\mu}\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\delta(xj,\\mu: Fp,Fq)w(xj)]\\qquad(12)\\]\n\\[p\\neq q\\]\nVproposed index takes an average proximity for all clusters of fuzzy c-partition. We see that a small value for Vproposed indicates a well-clustered fuzzy c-partition as suggested by Definition 2. Therefore, the best fuzzy c-partition or the optimum value of c is obtained by minimizing Vproposed over c = 2,3,...,\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0445."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "content": "To show the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed index in finding the optimal partition, extensive comparisons with other indexes are conducted on five widely used data sets. The proposed index Vproposed was compared with seven fuzzy cluster validity indexes for the fuzzy c-partition (U, V) obtained from the FCM: VPC [2], VPE [3], \u0474XB [5], VFS [6], VK [7], VCWB [8], VBerit [9]. For each data set, we made several runs of the FCM for different values of c = 2,.., Cmax. The parameters of the FCM were set as follows: termination criterion \u025b = 0.001, the weighting exponent m = 2.0, and || * ||2 was a square of the Euclidean norm. Initial centroids Vo were randomly selected.\nFigure 3(a) scatterplots the first data set that was described by Bendsaid [10]. The data set includes 49 data points in two dimensional measurement space, and consists of three clusters. Table 1 shows the results of validity indexes with respect to c = 2,3, ..., Cmax = 7. The optimal value c of each index is marked by bold face. For each c \u2265 2, eight validity indexes compute their index values. As mentioned before, all indexes except VPC take their minimums as optimal values. The number of clusters c = 3 in the Bendsaid's set was correctly recognized by five cluster validity indexes including the proposed index. VPE indicates the presence of two clusters. VFS and VCWB take their minimum at c = 7 and c = 6, respectively.\nFigure 3(b) shows a superset of the STARFIELD data set [5]. The data set contains 66 data points where eight or nine clusters are in agreement at a reasonably optimal partition. Table 2 shows the results of validity indexes with respect to c = 2,3,\u2026, Cmax = 8. We see that VCWB and Vproposed correctly recognize the presence of eight clusters. The six remaining indexes do not agree with the optimal c value. Vpc and VPE consider two clusters to be a natural structure. The minimum values of VXB and VK is obtained at c = 6. VFS points to c = 7. VBerit indexes recognize c = 5 clusters as an optimal partition.\nTable 3 summaries the comparison results of the validity indexes of five well-known data sets: BEN-"}, {"title": "5 Conclusions", "content": "In this paper, a new cluster validity index for the fuzzy c-partition has been proposed. The validity index takes the proximity between fuzzy clusters into account to evaluate the fuzzy partitions. Given a fuzzy partition, the proposed index computes an inter-cluster proximity based on a similarity in order to obtain meaningful structural information. The best fuzzy c-partition is obtained by minimizing the inter-cluster proximity with respect to c. The performance of the proposed index was tested on various data sets demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability. From the experiments that find the optimal number of clusters, the results indicate that the proposed approach is more reliable than other indexes. In future work, we plan to apply the proposed method to more realistic examples such as color image clustering. We would like to obtain the optimal clustering result of color images with the help of the validity index."}]}

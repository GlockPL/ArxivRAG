The most widely used fuzzy clustering algorithm is the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm proposed by Bezdek [1]. The algorithm, however, requires a pre-defined number of clusters (c) by a user. Different selections on the initial number of clusters result in different clustering partitions. Thus, it is necessary to validate each of the fuzzy c-partitions once they are found. This evaluation is called cluster validity. Many fuzzy cluster validity indexes have been proposed in the literature [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Bezdek's partition coefficient (PC) [2], partition entropy (PE) [3], and Xie-Beni's index [5] have been frequently used in current research. In this paper, a new cluster validity index for fuzzy clustering is proposed. The proposed index evaluates the fuzzy cluster partitions based on a proximity relation between fuzzy clusters. The proximity value is both the degree of overlapping and the inverse distance of separation between the clusters. Thus, a smaller proximity value indicates a lower degree of overlapping and farther separation between the clusters, which results in well-partitioned fuzzy clusters."}, {"title": "2 PREVIOUS WORK", "content": "The FCM clustering algorithm has been widely used to obtain the fuzzy c-partition. However, the algorithm may fall into local optima due to the initial selection of cluster centroids. Most of the clustering algorithms take a random generation to the initial selection method, which result in the fact that different selections on the initial cluster centroids cause different clustering partitions. Thus, an evaluation methodology was required to validate each of the fuzzy c-partitions once they are found. This evaluation is called cluster validity. In addition, a cluster validity can help to find out the optimal number of clusters (c) when the number of clusters is not known in a priori [8].\nThe objective of the FCM is to obtain the fuzzy c-partition F = {F1,F2, .., Fc } for both an unlabeled data set X = {x1,...,xn} and the number of clusters c by minimizing the evaluation function Jm:\n\nminimize Jm (U,V : X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{c}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(u_{ij})^m ||x_{j} - v_{i}||^2\\tag{1}\n\nwhere uij is the membership degree of data xj to a fuzzy cluster set F\u2081, and also, is an element of a (c \u00d7 n) pattern matrix U [\u00b5ij].

The parameter m controls the fuzziness of membership of each"}, {"title": "3 PROPOSED CLUSTER VALIDITY MEASURE", "content": "In this paper, a new cluster validity index for the FCM is proposed. The key concept is to exploit the geometric properties of fuzzy clusters. All the previous indexes including VPC and VPE focused on only the compactness and the variation of within-cluster. Some indexes such as VXB and VCWB have used the strength of separation between clusters in order to account for an inter-cluster structural information. However, those indexes are limited in their ability to provide a meaningful interpretation of structure in the data since the separation is simply computed by considering only the distance between cluster centroids.\n\nFigure 1 shows an example of how the traditional indexes are limited in their ability to recognize the correct difference between clusters. There are two different fuzzy partitions (U(a), V(a)) and (U(b), V(b)) containing the same separation distance between cluster centroids. Two fuzzy clusters F(a), F(a) \u2208 U(a) have their centroids v(a), v(a) \u2208 V(a) respectively in figure 1(a). In figure 1(b), two fuzzy clusters F(b), F(b) \u2208 U(b) have their own centroids v(b), v(b) \u2208 V(b), respectively. We find that (U(a), V(a)) is better separated than (U(b), V(b)) because a large number of data xj \u2208 X are more clearly classified in (U(a), V(a)). However, with the conventional indexes, it is difficult to tell which partition of the two is better in viewpoints of isolation\n\nand hard to differentiate the geometric structure between two partitions since the separation distances ||v(a) \u2013 v(a)|| and ||v(b) \u2013 v(b)|| are equal. The limitation is due to the simple measure of separation between cluster centroids.\n\nThus it is necessary to devise a new validity index that is capable of utilizing the overall geometric structure between clusters and deriving a sufficient interpretation from the structure in the data. We take a novel approach based on an inter-cluster proximity measure between fuzzy clusters. Each fuzzy cluster is represented and regarded as a fuzzy set in equation 8.\n\nF_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \u03bc_{ij}(x_{j})/x_{j} = \u03bc_{i}(x_{1})/x_{1}+\u03bc_{i}(x_{2})/x_{2} + ... + \u03bc_{i}(x_{n})/x_{n}\\tag{8}\n\nGiven fuzzy partition (U, V), the proposed index attempts to obtain the proximity between fuzzy clusters by computing the similarity between the fuzzy cluster sets. The inter-cluster proximity indicates both the degree of overlapping and the inverse distance of separation between the clusters. In other words, a smaller proximity value means a lower degree of overlapping and farther separation between the clusters, which results in well-partitioned fuzzy clusters."}, {"title": "3.2 Validity index using inter-cluster proximity", "content": "With each fuzzy cluster F_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \u03bc_{ij}(x_{j})/x_{j} = \u03bc_{i}(x_{1})/x_{1}+\u03bc_{i}(x_{2})/x_{2} + ... + \u03bc_{i}(x_{n})/x_{n}, we obtain the proximity value between two fuzzy clusters at each point of membership degree (u) before computing the total inter-cluster proximity. The proximity function f(u) at a given membership degree u between two fuzzy clusters F_{p} and F_{q} is defined as:\n\nf(\u03bc: F_{p}, F_{q}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \u03b4(x_{j},\u03bc: F_{p},F_{q})w(x_{j})\\tag{9}\n\nwhere\n\n\u03b4(x_{j},\u03bc: F_{p},F_{q}) = {\\begin{array}{ll}1.0 & if \u03bc \u2264 MIN(\u03bc_{F_{p}}(x_{j}), \u03bc_{F_{q}}(x_{j}))\\\\0.0 & otherwise\\end{array}}\\tag{10}\n\n\u03b4(xj,\u00b5: Fp,Fq) determines whether two clusters are proximate at the membership degree u for data xj. It returns that proximity is 1.0 when both membership degrees of the two clusters are more than u; otherwise, it returns 0.0. Furthermore, w(xj) is introduced to assign a weight for vague data. The weight value of w(xj) \u2208 [0.0, 1.0] is determined by the degree of sharing of data xj between clusters. Vague data are given more weight than clearly classified data. For example, w(xj) is given a value within [0.7,1.0] when xj is considered vague such that up; (xj) \u2264 0.5 for all Fi \u2208 F. Conversely, w(xj) is given a weight within [0.0,0.3] when xj is clearly classified as belonging to one of the clusters such that \u03bc\u0113; (xj) \u2265 0.8 for any F\u012f \u2208 F. This approach makes it possible for us to focus more concentration on the highly-overlapped vague data in the computation of the validity index than other indexes do.\n\nFigure 2 represents two proximity values f (u) at membership degree u between two fuzzy clusters. Two fuzzy partitions U(a) and U(b) were shown in the figure. In the figure 2(a), among all xj \u2208 X, only xj \u2208 r are given a value 1.0 by equation 10.

The validity index takes the proximity between fuzzy clusters into account to evaluate the fuzzy partitions. Given a fuzzy partition, the proposed index computes an inter-cluster proximity based on a similarity in order to obtain meaningful structural information. The best fuzzy c-partition is obtained by minimizing the inter-cluster proximity with respect to c. The performance of the proposed index was tested on various data sets demonstrating its effectiveness and reliability. From the experiments that find the optimal number of clusters, the results indicate that the proposed approach is more reliable than other indexes. In future work, we plan to apply the proposed method to more realistic examples such as color image clustering. We would like to obtain the optimal clustering result of color images with the help of the validity index."}]}

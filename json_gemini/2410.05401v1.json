{"title": "Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation", "authors": ["Tunazzina Islam", "Dan Goldwasser"], "abstract": "Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. We assess disparities in accuracy and error rates across demographic groups using established fairness metrics such as Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Predictive Equality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. The analysis of thematic explanations uncovers recurring patterns in messaging strategies tailored to various demographic groups, while the fairness analysis underscores the need for more inclusive and unbiased targeting methods. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Climate change represents one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, necessitating widespread public awareness and engagement to drive meaningful environmental action [26, 62]. As traditional media channels evolve, social media has emerged as a pivotal platform for climate communication, enabling organizations, activists, and policymakers to disseminate information, mobilize support, and influence public discourse on environmental issues [2, 35, 63]. The interactive and targeted nature of social media advertising allows for the customization of messages to resonate with specific audiences, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of communication strategies aimed at fostering climate awareness and behavioral change [12, 74, 80].\nIn recent years, the utilization of microtargeting strategies in social media campaigns has gained significant traction. Microtargeting involves the precise tailoring of messages to distinct demographic segments based on factors such as age, gender, location, and interests [7, 34, 64]. This approach leverages vast amounts of user data to craft personalized content that is more likely to engage and persuade individual users. In the context of climate communication, microtargeting can enhance the relevance and impact of messages, potentially leading to greater public engagement and support for environmental initiatives. However, the sophistication of these strategies also raises critical questions about the transparency, ethical implications, and overall effectiveness of targeted climate messaging [40, 43].\nDespite the growing prevalence of microtargeting in climate campaigns, there remains a limited understanding of the specific techniques and linguistic patterns employed to engage different demographic groups. Traditionally, thematic analysis (TA) has been the preferred method for this task, functioning as a qualitative research technique that focuses on identifying patterns, where themes that emerge from the data drive further analysis [13, 14, 66, 76, 78, 79]. However, with the surge of textual data in the digital era, there is an increasing trend towards using computational methods for text analysis [29, 44, 73]. TA method often falls short in capturing the nuanced and context-dependent nature of targeted communication. This gap highlights the need for advanced analytical tools that can dissect and interpret the complex language and strategies used in microtargeted climate advertisements. Large language models (LLMs) [15], with their robust natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, offer a promising solution to this challenge. In this paper, we investigate whether the newly emerged paradigm in NLP; zero-shot prompting of LLMs [15] and the practice of providing explanations of answers is better equipped to address those challenges.\nExplanations are fundamental to human learning [3], as they underscore task principles that facilitate broad generalizations [56, 57]. Consider the example text (\"The turbines that provide clean wind energy also create new habitats for fish, keeping the ecosystem healthy.\") from Figure 2(a) for gender identification task. An explanation can elaborate on a brief answer (e.g., male) by connecting it to the broader reasoning process necessary to solve the problem (e.g., \"Emphasizing fish habitats may appeal more to men interested in fishing and environmental conservation.\"). Thus, explanations enhance understanding by demonstrating how task principles connect questions to their answers.\nWhile LLMs offer powerful capabilities for analyzing and generating text, their widespread use has also highlighted significant challenges related to fairness [51, 53, 54, 68] and bias [28, 30, 50, 55, 77]. Research has shown that LLMs, like other machine learning (ML) models, can inherit and even amplify biases present in the data they are trained on [10, 11]. These biases can manifest in various forms, such as differential accuracy across demographic groups [22, 27, 36, 58], harmful stereotypes [4, 9, 59], and discriminatory language patterns [69]. The implications are particularly concerning in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and social media, where biased outcomes can perpetuate inequities and undermine trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems [16, 60]. Addressing these issues requires fairness evaluations using metrics like Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Predictive Equality to ensure that models perform equitably across all user groups [33, 87]. In the context of this study, examining the fairness of LLMs predictions in demographic targeting is crucial for understanding the microtargeted climate messaging.\nIn this study, we conduct a post-hoc analysis of climate microtargeting practices on social media by leveraging the power of LLMs (OpenAI's o1-preview model\u00b9). Post-hoc analysis, typically performed after the main experiment or event, allows us to retrospectively evaluate how effective these campaigns are in targeting specific demographics. Building upon data from previous research by Islam et al. [43], we investigate the ability of LLMs to accurately detect targeted messaging based on specific demographic variables, including gender and age group. Additionally, LLMs provide explanations for their classification decisions, offering insights into the thematic and linguistic elements used to engage different audiences. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions.\nOur exploration leads us to the following research questions (RQ), which are crucial for assessing the potential of LLMs to understand microtargeting patterns and provide deeper and more nuanced insights:\n\u2022 RQ1: Given a text, can LLMs predict the targeted demographic of the corresponding text accurately and provide the explanation for the reasoning behind the prediction?\n\u2022 RQ2: Which words or phrases are most commonly associated with certain demographics?\n\u2022 RQ3: What are the recurrent themes and aspects of explanations provided by LLMs?\n\u2022 RQ4: How fair are the LLMs predictions in terms of demographic targeting, and what are the disparities in prediction accuracy and error rates across different demographic groups?\nThe implications of this research are multifaceted. From an academic perspective, it contributes to the burgeoning field of computational social science (CSS) by showcasing the application of advanced language models in dissecting complex communication strategies. Practically, the findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, environmental organizations, and social media platforms seeking to enhance the transparency, accountability, and inclusivity of their climate communication efforts. By illuminating the specific methods used to tailor messages to different demographics and by highlighting the need for fairer and more inclusive targeting methods, this study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the role of Al in enhancing the efficacy and ethical standards of digital climate advocacy."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The intersection of microtargeting, social media, and climate communication has drawn considerable interest in recent years, with studies examining how digital platforms influence public opinion and engagement [37, 40, 41, 43]. The growing capabilities of social media platforms to deliver personalized messages based on user data have sparked a significant body of research into computational advertising [1, 38, 84, 85], demographic targeting [5, 45, 46, 48, 65, 67], and the broader implications of these practices for societal discourse."}, {"title": "3 Dataset", "content": "We investigate the climate campaigns case study for this work. We work on the corpus of 21372 ads released by Islam et al. [43]. This dataset includes climate-related English ads on Facebook from the US, spanning from January 2021 to January 2022. Each ad includes the following attributes: ad ID, title, ad description, ad body, funding entity, spend, impressions, and distribution of impressions broken down by gender (male, female, unknown), age (seven groups), and location down to the state level in the USA. Additional details about the dataset can be found in the original publications.\nFor this work, we consider two demographic indicators, i.e., gender and age group. We consider two gender categories, i.e., male vs female. Regarding age group, we consider four age group"}, {"title": "4 Task Definition", "content": "The identification of the targeted demographic (with explanation) in a text involves the following steps:\nGender prediction with Explanation: For a given text t, the task involves identifying the targeted gender and explaining the rationale behind its selection.\nAge group prediction with Explanation: Subsequently, the task requires predicting the targeted age group and providing an explanation for the specific choice.\nTo predict the targeted demographics, we employ zero-shot prompting using the most recently\u00b2 released by OpenAI, o1-preview model\u00b3. This is a new large language model that uses reinforcement learning (RL) and chain of thought (COT) techniques for complex reasoning, allowing it to think through a detailed internal process before responding to users.\nThe prompt template for the demographic prediction task with an explanation using LLMs can be found in Figure 3.

LLMs can predict the targeted demographics with an accuracy of 88.55% answering RQ1. Figure 6 in App. B.1 shows confusion matrices for targeted gender (Figure 6a) and age (Figure 6b) prediction. This helps identify specific demographics where the model performs well or struggles. LLMs achieve high accuracy in predicting both females (94.92%) and males (85.10%) (Figure 6a). A small number of females are misclassified as males, and a few males are misclassified as females. Figure 6b shows high accuracy for young (88.00%) and early working (91.46%) categories. Performance drops for the late working (75%) age group and significantly for senior (33.33%) categories.\nFor baseline comparison, we use open sourced LLMs Llama 3 (llama3-70b-81924) [75] and Mistral Large 2 (mistral-large-24075) [47].

Each entry includes the actual demographic, the predicted demographic, and a brief explanation generated by LLMs. Table 10 and explanations highlight how specific patterns and themes within an ad can lead to demographic misclassifications. In some cases, traditional gender roles and age-related interests played a significant role in these misclassifications. Understanding these nuances can help in refining predictive models and improving the accuracy of demographic targeting in future ad campaigns."}, {"title": "6 Ad Content Analysis", "content": "To determine which words or phrases are most commonly associated with certain demographics (answering RQ2), we identify the top-5 most frequent bigrams (two-word pairs) and trigrams (three-word pairs) of the ad content for male, female, young adults, and early working age group. Due to the small sample size, we do not show this analysis for the late working age group and senior citizens. Table 11 in App. C details the results.\nThese frequent bigrams and trigrams highlight key themes in the ads, particularly focusing on the phrases related to climate action, urgency (emergency), and leadership for young adults. On the other hand, frequent bigrams and trigrams of early working age group highlight the central themes of climate change, clean energy, and calls to action in the ads. Moreover, for male, these frequent bigrams and trigrams highlight the recurring themes related to climate change, clean energy, and specific campaigns or initiatives in the ads. In contrast, for female, these frequent bigrams and trigrams emphasize recurring themes around climate change, clean energy, and the 'Build Back Better' agenda in the ads (Table 11 in App. C).\nTo calculate the statistical significance, we perform Chi-Square Test [21] for Independence between male and female demographics and their bigrams/trigrams. The p-values for both the bigrams and trigrams are greater than the common significance level of 0.05. This suggests that there is no statistically significant association between gender (male and female) and the frequency of the bigrams and trigrams analyzed. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observed differences in bigram and trigram frequencies between males and females could be due to chance.\nThe same trend is noticed while performing a Chi-Square Test for Independence between the young adults (18-24) and early working (25-44) age groups and their bigrams/trigram."}, {"title": "7 Thematic Insights of Explanations", "content": "As LLMs provide explanations to provide reasoning behind their prediction, we use those explanations for thematic analysis to answer RQ3.

The explanations consistently emphasize the following aspects:\nInterest in Technology and Innovation: Men are often depicted as being more engaged with technology, engineering, and renewable energy solutions. Ads related to technical aspects of engines, energy efficiency, and infrastructure are considered more likely to appeal to men.\nFocus on Economic and Financial Issues: Many explanations suggest that men are more concerned with economic benefits, investment opportunities, and financial savings, making them the likely target for ads that emphasize these aspects.\nProperty and Land Management: The theme of land ownership, property value improvement, and land management is frequently mentioned, with the assumption that men are more interested in these areas.\nTraditional Male Activities: Ads that involve traditionally male-oriented activities, such as beer consumption, vehicle-related savings, home maintenance, and physical strength, are seen as more likely to target men.\nEngagement in Political and Infrastructure Topics: Men are often portrayed as more engaged in political discourse, infrastructure initiatives, and discussions around energy and policy, making them the primary audience for ads focused on these themes.\nConservative Views and Skepticism: Some explanations suggest that men are more likely to resonate with conservative views, skepticism about environmental claims, and anti-establishment sentiments.\nFrom 2nd row of Table 3, we observe that the overall theme revolves around targeting women by aligning ads with their roles as caregivers, environmental advocates, and socially conscious individuals who prioritize the well-being of their families, communities, and the environment. The explanations consistently emphasize the following aspects:\nParental and Caregiving Roles: Many explanations highlight that women, particularly mothers, are more likely to resonate with messages about protecting children's futures, parental responsibilities, and family well-being. These ads often appeal to maternal instincts and the role of women as primary caregivers.\nEnvironmental Consciousness: Women are frequently depicted as being more engaged with environmental issues, sustainability, and community health. The explanations suggest that women are more proactive and vocal about climate change, conservation, and eco-friendly initiatives.\nSocial Welfare and Community Involvement: The explanations note that women are more likely to be concerned with social issues such as paid leave, affordable childcare, healthcare, and community well-being. Ads that emphasize these themes are seen as more likely to appeal to women.\nEmpathy and Emotional Appeal: The explanations often mention that women are more responsive to ads that evoke empathy, emotional concerns, and collective action. This includes ads that focus on protecting the environment for future generations and supporting social safety nets.\nFemale Empowerment and Leadership: Some explanations specifically mention themes of women's empowerment, leadership, and support for female scientists or leaders. These themes are likely to resonate more with female audiences who identify with or support gender equality and empowerment.\nHealth and Safety Concerns: Women are portrayed as being more attentive to issues related to health, safety, and the well-being of their families and communities. This includes a strong focus on environmental health and sustainability."}, {"title": "7.2 Themes and Aspects of Age Explanations", "content": "We prompt LLMs in a zero-shot manner to provide the common theme and aspects under specific theme of the explanations from 22 correct young adult predictions, 75 correct early working age group predictions, 6 correct late working age group predictions, and 2 correct senior citizen predictions. We detail the theme of the age group explanation and aspects of that explanation in Table 12 in App. D.\nFrom 1st row of Table 12 (App. D), we observe that the overall theme revolves around the activism and the environmental consciousness of young adults, positioning them as a key demographic for campaigns and initiatives focused on climate change and sustainability. The explanations consistently highlight the following aspects:\nPassion for Climate Action: Young adults are described as being particularly passionate about addressing climate change, often leading or participating in environmental activism and campaigns.\nSupport for Bold Environmental Leadership: This age group is likely to support bold and urgent actions related to environmental protection and sustainability.\nEngagement with Activism: The explanations emphasize that young adults are more likely to be engaged in climate-related activism and are motivated to take meaningful actions.\nDesire for Immediate Change: There is a recurring mention of the desire for immediate and meaningful change, reflecting the urgency with which young adults approach environmental issues.\nParticipation in Training and Advocacy: The group is also characterized as eager to participate in training programs and initiatives that allow them to contribute actively to environmental causes.\nFrom 2nd row of Table 12 in App. D, we can see that the overall theme revolves around the proactive and responsible mindset of early working-age adults, who are not only financially capable but also motivated by a strong sense of social and environmental responsibility. They are seen as key targets for initiatives that combine sustainability with practical, career-oriented, and family-focused benefits. The explanations consistently emphasize the following aspects:\nEnvironmental Consciousness: This age group is described as being highly engaged with environmental issues, such as climate change, sustainability, and clean energy. They are likely to support initiatives and products that align with eco-friendly values.\nFinancial Stability and Disposable Income: Many explanations note that individuals in this group have disposable income, making them financially capable of supporting and investing in sustainable products, services, and causes.\nParental and Future Concerns: This demographic is often portrayed as parents or future-focused individuals who are concerned about the impact of environmental issues on their children and future generations.\nCareer Engagement and Professional Roles: The explanations frequently mention that this age group is active in their careers, often holding decision-making roles that influence corporate and household sustainability practices.\nInterest in Innovation and Technology: Individuals in this age group are also depicted as being interested in innovative industries, clean energy solutions, and sustainability technologies, which align with their professional and personal goals.\nSocial and Political Engagement: The group is characterized as being engaged in socio-political issues, particularly those related to corporate accountability, sustainability, and environmental advocacy.\nFrom 3rd row of Table 12 in App. D, we can notice that the overall theme revolves around the responsibilities and concerns of individuals in the late working (45-64) age group, focusing on their roles as homeowners, voters, and economically engaged citizens who are likely to be influenced by environmental, economic, and policy-related messaging. The explanations specifically emphasize the following aspects:\nEconomic and Environmental Responsibility: Many of the explanations mention that individuals in this age group are concerned with sustainability, home energy efficiency, and environmental impact. They are likely to invest in public resources and adopt changes that contribute to economic and environmental sustainability.\nHomeownership and Financial Stability: This demographic is characterized as established homeowners who are financially secure. They are seen as key targets for changes related to home energy efficiency, such as adopting solar power, due to their financial means and homeownership status.\nVoter and Policy Engagement: The explanations suggest that this age group is politically active, particularly concerned with public safety, and likely to support policy changes by voting on local measures.\nEconomic Concerns: There is an emphasis on economic factors such as unemployment, inflation, and gas prices, with concerns about current economic policies affecting their businesses and financial stability.\nFrom 4th row of Table 12 (App. D), we notice that the overall theme centers on health and safety concerns that are particularly important to senior citizens, with a focus on programs that cater to their specific needs and the heightened risks they face in certain situations. The key aspects highlighted in the explanations are:\nHealth and Wellness Programs: The first explanation mentions programs like SilverSneakers and Silver&Fit, which are specifically designed for senior citizens to support their physical health and well-being.\nVulnerability and Safety: The second explanation focuses on the increased vulnerability of seniors to COVID-19 and emphasizes the risks they face, particularly in the context of political decisions or public health issues."}, {"title": "8 Fairness and Bias Analysis", "content": "In this section, we present a comprehensive fairness analysis of the model for gender and age group classifications to answer RQ4. We evaluate the models using established fairness metrics such as Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Predictive Equality to assess their performance across different groups. By analyzing confusion matrices and classification reports, we identify any disparities in prediction accuracy and error rates between groups. Our analysis aims to identify biases, investigate the underlying reasons for any observed biases. The insights gained from this analysis are critical for guiding future research in developing fair and inclusive algorithms."}, {"title": "8.1 Fairness Analysis on Gender Prediction", "content": "To assess the fairness of the model on gender prediction, we compute several fairness metrics, including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Predictive Equality.\nDemographic parity examines whether each gender group receives positive predictions at equal rates. Table 4 presents the Demographic Parity ratios for each gender. A ratio of 1 indicates perfect parity. The results show that females have a slightly higher likelihood of receiving positive predictions compared to males, suggesting a minor imbalance favoring the female class.\nEqual Opportunity (True Positive Rate) focuses on the True Positive Rates (TPR) across gender groups, measuring the model's"}, {"title": "8.2 Fairness Analysis on Age Group Prediction", "content": "Results in Table 5 show that the late working group has a higher likelihood of receiving positive predictions, while the senior group has a significantly lower rate, indicating potential bias against seniors. The senior group has a Demographic Parity ratio of 0.33, significantly lower than the ideal value of 1, suggesting under representation in positive predictions.\nTable 6 shows that the TPR for the senior group is notably lower, suggesting the model is less effective at correctly identifying individuals in this age group. The senior group has an FPR of 0, indicating no false positives, while the early working group has the highest FPR among the groups.\nTo understand the observed bias in the misclassified senior age group, we conduct an analysis of the misclassified instances (Table 7). The goal is to identify patterns and underlying reasons why the model predicts seniors as belonging to the young and late working age group. The misclassification of the Senior age group as Young or Late Working can be attributed to several factors:\nThematic Content and Topic Association: The first three misclassified ads (Table 7) focus on climate change, environmental activism, and sustainability. These topics are often associated with younger demographics, particularly young adults (18-24), who are perceived to be more engaged in activism and environmental causes. The model appears to have learned an association between these topics and the Young age group, leading to misclassification when seniors engage with similar content.\nIn Table 7, the fourth instance shows a misclassification where the model predicts it as a late working (45-64 years) age group. The ad mentions 'working families', which is a term commonly associated with individuals in the Late Working age group who are actively engaged in the workforce and supporting families. The content revolves around a political campaign emphasizing the need for change and active participation, themes often associated with the 4564 age demographic who are typically more politically active and influential.\nLack of Age-Specific Cues: The misclassified ads do not contain explicit references to seniors or age-specific language that would signal the content is intended for the senior demographic. The language is broad and does not mention age-related concerns, such as retirement, health issues prevalent among seniors, or senior-specific programs.\nReliance on Stereotypical Associations: The explanations generated by LLMs indicate that the model relies on stereotypes, associating certain topics exclusively with specific age groups. By assuming that environmental activism is primarily of interest to young adults, the model overgeneralizes by overlooking the possibility that seniors are also engaged in these issues.\nFeature Representation Limitations: The model may lack features that capture subtle cues indicating the ad's target age group when explicit age markers are absent. The model may not effectively utilize contextual information that could hint at the intended audience beyond topic associations. For example, the interests and concerns of the late working and senior age groups can overlap, especially in areas like politics and social change."}, {"title": "9 Conclusion", "content": "Our work advances the discourse on climate microtargeting by demonstrating the utility of LLMs in accurately detecting and explaining targeted messaging strategies on social media. We provide a broader theme and various aspects under each theme based on the explanations from LLMs, which we hope will be an important contribution to the CSS community. Besides, the fairness analysis conducted in our study underscores the importance of evaluating and addressing the biases. Disparities in prediction accuracy and error rates, particularly in underrepresented groups, highlight the need for more inclusive and equitable targeting methods.

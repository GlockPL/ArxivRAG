Krogmeier"], "abstract": "Effective strategies for sensor data management are essential for advancing transportation research,\nespecially in the current data-driven era, due to the advent of novel applications in artificial intelligence.\nThis paper presents comprehensive guidelines for managing transportation sensor data, encompassing both\narchived static data and real-time data streams. The real-time system architecture integrates various\napplications with data acquisition systems (DAQ). By deploying the in-house designed, open-source\n\"Avena\u201d software platform alongside the NATS messaging system as a secure communication broker,\nreliable data exchange is ensured. While robust databases like TimescaleDB facilitate organized storage,\nvisualization platforms like Grafana provide real-time monitoring capabilities.\nIn contrast, static data standards address the challenges in handling unstructured, voluminous\ndatasets. The standards advocate for a combination of cost-effective bulk cloud storage for unprocessed\nsensor data and relational databases for recording summarized analyses. They highlight the role of cloud\ndata transfer tools like FME for efficient migration of sensor data from local storages onto the cloud.\nFurther, integration of robust visualization tools into the framework helps in deriving patterns and trends\nfrom these complex datasets.\nThe proposals were applied to INDOT's real-world case studies involving the I-65 and I-69\nGreenfield districts. For real-time data collection, Campbell Scientific DAQ systems were used, enabling\ncontinuous generation and monitoring of sensor metrics. In the case of the archived I-69 database, summary\ndata was compiled in Oracle, while the unprocessed data was stored in SharePoint. The results underline\nthe effectiveness of the proposed guidelines and motivate their adoption in research projects.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Transportation research studies are aimed at exploring various aspects of network design,\nassessment of pavement material behavior under varying load and weather conditions (1),\ncreating\nconducive environments for maintaining uninterrupted vehicular flow (2), and optimizing other key\nelements of traffic engineering. The primary goal of these research efforts is to improve the overall quality\nof transportation systems, thereby ensuring public safety. To facilitate these studies, numerous sensors are\ndeployed across the transportation network. These sensors continuously furnish information regarding\ntraffic dynamics and pavement conditions. Consequently, a vast amount of sensor data is generated (3-4),\nwhich needs to be effectively reduced, securely transmitted and efficiently stored. This facilitates qualitative\ndata exploration and comprehensive interpretation using state-of-the-art data mining and machine learning\ntechniques.\nHowever, managing such an extensive and diverse dataset poses a major challenge since the large\nvolume of data collected complicates the analysis (5). Furthermore, the data often necessitates intensive\ncleaning, validation and preprocessing to reduce errors and normalize inconsistencies that may arise due to\nsensor defects or varying environmental factors. Hence, effective tools and techniques to process and\nanalyze the data are needed, preferably in real-time and in a centralized information database. Such\nstrategies can help to better organize the data, deduce underlying patterns and relationships, employ data\nabstraction techniques and thereby make informed decisions based on evidence. This facilitates the\ndevelopment of a sustainable transportation infrastructure in the long run.\nAdditionally, researchers often deploy sensors from different manufacturers in the data monitoring\nsystems. In such cases, integrating sensors with different output formats, communication protocols, power\nprofiles, calibration specifications and interfacing mechanisms can lead to incompatibility issues.\nTherefore, sensor interaction, collaboration and synchronization are essential in the design of an end-to-end\ndata management system, helping to streamline workflows and aiding proactive maintenance with minimal\nresearch costs.\nConsidering these constraints, in this paper, we propose overarching system architectures to\naddress the challenges hindering seamless data monitoring and maintenance for transportation research.\nThe long-term vision of the proposed system is to equip researchers and transportation departments with\nreliable and interactive tools for data management that can optimally serve their experimental and\nmaintenance needs. We recommend guidelines to format static databases, handle real-time data\ningestion and streaming, strategize sensor monitoring and data connectivity using an IoT fabric and\nnetwork core, integrate agency-scale data storage solutions to organize archived and active data and\nincorporate interactive tools to enable comprehensive data visualization and analytics. Building on the\nproposed guidelines, we exemplify their utility and efficacy through two separate Indiana Department of\nTransportation (INDOT) projects leveraging various sensors to monitor the pavement on sections of I-65\nand I-69 highways."}, {"title": "MOTIVATION AND SCOPE", "content": "Numerous transportation studies involving sensors are conducted globally each year. Many of these\nstudies involve researchers and engineers visiting the field for experiments, physically monitoring the\nsensors for extended periods and then manually transporting the collected data back to a central location\nfor analysis. This approach is inherently burdened with multiple drawbacks. In addition to the labor-\nintensive process of physically overseeing the experiments and offloading the data for post-processing,\nresearchers often experience data loss or erroneous data. Deferred processing and delayed experimental\nfeedback, risk overlooking the defective data that may arise from factors such as hardware failures, power\ninterruptions, environmental elements or even human errors. These data irregularities can be prevented by\nautomated real-time monitoring at the central data storage location. Proactive monitoring facilitates early\ndetection of outages, sensor malfunctions and local storage anomalies. Further, real-time data\nvisualization tools provide immediate pavement health insights and deeper situational awareness,\nminimizing post-processing efforts. This motivates the need for a comprehensive system for real-time data\nmonitoring and delivery.\nA wealth of sensor data is available in various storage repositories throughout the industry,\nprimarily in a non-standard, unprocessed state. We refer to such pre-compiled, historical data logs as static\ndatasets throughout this literature. Researchers and engineers would often require viewing the summary of\nthese static sensor databases, including critical details, such as timestamp, data quality indicators,\ncalibration information, key error logs and other sensor metadata. Accessing, navigating, and manipulating\nexisting sensor records is fraught with significant challenges, given the enormity of size and irregularities\nin data archiving. An industry standard to manage large-scale, unprocessed sensor databases would greatly\nenhance access to the data and prepare a data record suitable for modern processing techniques\nincorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning. Such guidelines would not only help researchers\nto better organize the sensor data and identify critical records, but also help to identify key patterns and\ntrends, assess the data quality and make informed decisions. Further, given the monumental scope of the\ndata, software tools to efficiently transfer the data to and from the database is imperative. This will improve\nthe responsiveness of the system and expedite the research process. Similar to a real-time data system,\nintegrating reliable data visualization tools with such static databases will help in interactive data analysis\nand comparative research.\nConsolidating the static database management and real-time data collection and monitoring process\nunder industry-wide standards will help not only the researchers, but also transportation planners who are\ninterested in big data analysis. Such organizational standards must not only be robust, proposing widely\naccessible and adaptable tools, but also be flexible and futuristic, composed of state-of-the-art, preferably\nopen-source applications. It should also be compatible with existing solutions, ensuring seamless\nintegration and simple upgradation of the prevalent techniques. This will enhance capabilities, promote\nscalabilities, improve performance and efficiency and further bolster innovation, maximizing return on\ninvestment in the long run. Enabling the researchers to take a data-driven approach will further optimize\nresource allocation and support predictive analysis with artificial intelligence and expand the scope of\ntransportation research."}, {"title": "METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this section we first propose the operational standards for static database management and the\nsystem architecture for managing real-time data. We further illustrate the application of these guidelines\nthrough practical deployments in two INDOT projects."}, {"title": "Guidelines for Static Data", "content": null}, {"title": "System Architecture for Real-time Data", "content": "While managing static databases necessitates dedicated preprocessing and management,\nreal-time sensor data collection from experimental sites presents unique challenges as well. Figure\n15 describes a comprehensive end-to-end solution for optimizing the remote monitoring of the real-\ntime sensor data generated at the data source. The proposed system leverages \u201cAvena\u201d, a novel\nopen-source framework that can intelligently process high-resolution data (8-9). Avena was\ninitially designed to create an efficient edge computing ecosystem for machine computers, while\nsafeguarding data autonomy. The framework operates on Linux containers and cloud technology\nand facilitates data flow between edge computers and server systems, ensuring seamless data\nexchange in the edge-to-core architecture. Although Avena was initially envisioned for agricultural\nplatforms, it can be seamlessly adopted for data management in transportation research systems."}, {"title": null, "content": "The proposed architecture for real-time data collection and management is proposed to be\ngeneric, comprising of multiple adaptable components that can be customized for different\noperational instances. The Avena framework describes how data should flow between devices and\npresents an overlay network in which all the components on the network appear to be directly\nconnected, regardless of their potential disconnection or spatial distribution. Following is a brief of\nthese constituents of the architecture:\n1. Data source: This refers to the system generating sensor data enabling analysis and research. A\nmultitude of sensors are deployed for transportation studies, including earth pressure cells (EPCs),\nstrain gauges, video cameras, humidity sensors, air quality sensors and laser profile sensors.\nCombinations of sensors are selected based on the specific research problem that needs to be\naddressed. A data acquisition system (DAQ) (7) actively monitors these sensors. The DAQ consists\nof signal conditioning units, analog-to-digital converters and power management modules and is\ncapable of sampling and collecting the sensor data. Different vendors such as Labjack, Campbell\nScientific, BDI and National Instruments provide commercial DAQ solutions.\n2. Data interface: This pertains to a software application hosted on the DAQ that facilitates the\ntransmission or exchange of sensor data between the DAQ and the NATS messaging system.\nDepending on the sophistication, it can represent a standard messaging protocol such as message\nqueuing telemetry transport (MQTT) or Telnet. NATS is a secure, lightweight messaging service\ndesigned for creating multi-node distributed platforms, cloud-native applications and IoT solutions\n(6). NATS is widely integrated into IoT systems due to its scalability and robust performance.\nFurther, being an open-source messaging system supporting multiple programming languages, it\noffers greater flexibility for researchers and developers. These considerations establish NATS as\nan optimal choice for integration into the primary pathway for service interactions in the real-time\nsystem architecture. Here, NATS operates as a message broker in publish-subscribe model,\nwhereby the DAQ communicates sensor messages to a particular topic and the server subscribing\nto the same topic receives the sent messages, thereby avoiding any redundant data exchanges in the\nsystem.\n3. Database: Integrating a robust database within the end-to-end system provides an organized and\nefficient storage solution and allows for convenient access of the data by the researchers in a\nsecure, readily accessible repository. Ideally, a potential candidate for a reliable database should\nbe capable of managing high-speed time-critical sensor data, accommodate increasing number of\nsensors, adapt to larger datasets, handle queries at scale and support notification and alert\nfeatures. Several contemporary database solutions enable these benefits and additionally\nfacilitate real-time coordination with data analytics and visualization tools, artificial intelligence\nmodels and third-party APIs, all of which can significantly bolster the data analysis potential of\nresearchers. Notable examples are InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, Apache Pinot and Prometheus.\n4. Visualization platform: Data representation and visualization tools that seamlessly integrate with\nthe adopted database are essential for real-time monitoring of the sensor measurements. These tools\nenable researchers to conduct preliminary assessment of the sensor data and evaluate if the patterns\nand trends are consistent with the expected behavior. Distinctive features such as user-friendly\ninterface, interactive and customizable dashboards, versatile visualization options including graphs\nand maps, high frequency data processing competence, data filtering and aggregation capabilities,\ncross platform compatibility are some of the valuable prospects that are desirable in these tools.\nPower BI, Grafana, Kibana and Tableau are some of the popular visualization platforms used for\ndata illustration and graphical representation of data streams."}, {"title": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "In this work we conducted a deep dive analysis of the best practices for the effective management\nof sensor data collected from field testing of the instrumented sections of I-65 and I-69 Greenfield districts.\nThe data was collected by Purdue-INDOT researchers to monitor and evaluate pavement behavior over\ntime. In the study, we proposed that for massive historical datasets, summary and metric data are suitable\nfor storage in relational databases and the unprocessed data was more suited to blob storage. Researchers\nprimarily prefer sensor metrics over the raw sensor data itself. They reduce the data complexity by applying\nthe analytical methods of prior research to the data before storing it in relational databases like Oracle and\nutilizing it within existing INDOT data systems. Such systems include FME and ArcGIS Online.\nFinally, a complete end-to-end system architecture for collecting embedded sensor data in real-time\nvia remote data acquisition systems was proposed. The case study system used solar-powered Campbell\nequipment which is largely designed for automatic but local data collection. The data management solution\nleveraged the Avena framework which modernizes the design of real-time remote data collection and\nenables edge computing on the data stream. As a result, the sensors can be monitored 24x7, and useful\nmetrics produced in real-time and pushed to centralized data storage, massively reducing the latency\nbetween measurement and use in INDOT data-driven decisions. However, the restrictions of the Campbell\nDAQ hardware motivate further exploration into potentialities of introducing Avena within the roadside\nDAQ to enable a more open data flow.\nThe system proposals provide holistic end-to-end solutions for static and real-time data\nmanagement in transportation research studies. The presented case studies validate the functionality and\nthe effectiveness of the proposals and fosters confidence in its operation. The work will encourage the\nresearchers to adopt and integrate the proposals into various real-world projects within and across (13-14)\nthe boundaries of transportation research."}]}

With its ability to provide a global view and a broader sensing range, the roadside perspective is worth developing. LiDAR provides precise three-dimensional spatial information, while cameras offer semantic information. These two modalities are complementary in 3D detection. However, adding camera data does not increase accuracy in some studies since the information extraction and fusion procedure is not sufficiently reliable. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as replacements for MLPs, which are better suited for high-dimensional, complex data. Both the camera and the LiDAR provide high-dimensional information, and employing KANs should enhance the extraction of valuable features to produce better fusion outcomes. This paper proposes Kanin- fradet3D, which optimizes the feature extraction and fusion modules. To extract features from complex high-dimensional data, the model's encoder and fuser modules were improved using KAN Layers. Cross-attention was applied to enhance feature fusion, and visual comparisons verified that camera features were more evenly integrated. This addressed the issue of camera features being abnormally concentrated, negatively impacting fusion. Compared to the benchmark, our approach shows improvements of +9.87 mAP and +10.64 mAP in the two viewpoints of the TUMTraf Intersection Dataset and an improvement of +1.40 mAP in the roadside end of the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset. The results indicate that Kaninfradet3D can effectively fuse features, demonstrating the potential of applying KANs in roadside perception tasks.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Robust and effective road environment perception is the premise of realizing an automatic driving system. Compared to ego-vehicle perception, roadside perception offers sev- eral advantages: an overhead global perspective can avoid target occlusion issues, reduce blind spots in perception, and provide longer-range target detection. Additionally, ego-vehicle perception depends on advanced sensor equipment and computational power on the vehicle, increasing the cost of autonomous vehicles. Roadside perception relies on public infrastructure's sensing equipment and computing power, which is conducive to the future popularization of autonomous driving."}, {"title": "3D road environment perception can rely on various sen- sors, with cameras and LiDAR being the most fundamental modalities. Camera sensors can provide image data and dense semantic information, while LiDAR can give accurate and dense three-dimensional spatial point cloud positions. Both modalities contain a wealth of information. Currently, many studies focus on camera-LiDAR fusion. Conversely, LiDAR is more effective at figuring out an object's 3D spatial position, while visual data is superior at classifying items. However, not all information provided by LiDAR and cameras is beneficial for training. For example, Zimmer et al. found that using LiDAR data with Coopdet3D and InfraDet3D on the TUMTraf Intersection Dataset resulted in higher mAP compared to the combination of camera and LiDAR [1]. Besides the final object detection metrics, cur- rent research lacks methods to determine whether extracted features are beneficial or reasonable. This study uses a cross- attention block to capture the interdependencies between the two modalities and visualizes the features to demonstrate the useful information extracted from both modalities.\nIn 3D object detection, transformer modules and convolu- tional neural networks (CNNs)-based modules are commonly used to extract features from both branches. These modules are limited to linear modeling, which presents challenges in handling complex information. Additionally, as black-box models, they lack interpretability. Recently, Kolmogorov- Arnold Networks (KAN) have provided modules based on combinations of nonlinear functions. These can replace multiple continuous linear layers in the model, resulting in stronger fitting capabilities and improved interpretability. Thus, this study proposes Kaninfradet3D, a roadside radar- vision fusion 3D perception model designed to extract non- linear features better and enhance fusion performance. In this model, KANs-enhanced encoders are utilized to extract nonlinear features, and the intrinsic correlation between the two modalities is also calculated to improve the fusion process.

RELATED WORK", "content": null}, {"title": "A. Roadside perception", "content": "At present, the related research of 3D perception mainly focuses on the perspective of the vehicle, and relatively few rely on roadside infrastructures. This is mainly due to the lack of supporting roadside datasets. Ye et al. released Rope3D [2], a large-scale roadside dataset containing 3D objects on images. Subsequently, Yu et al. released the large-scale multimodal dataset DAIR-V2X [3], which includes data from both vehicle and roadside perspectives, with DAIR- V2X-I focusing on the roadside perspective and containing LiDAR and image data. Zimmer et al. released the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset, which also includes both vehicle and roadside data, providing multiple view- points of an intersection. These datasets have advanced the development of roadside perception.\nBEVHeight [4] and BEVHeight++ [5] are methods that rely solely on vision. They regress the height of vehicles to the ground instead of predicting the pixel-wise depth. Wang et al. proposed the pillar attention fusion network [6], which uses LiDAR data from both vehicle and roadside perspec- tives for 3D detection. However, research on LiDAR and vision fusion is still relatively scarce. Zimmer et al. released InfraDet3D [7], which uses early fusion for two LiDARS and late fusion to combine monocular camera information. They then proposed Coopdet3D based on BEVFusion [8] and PillarGrid [9], using deep fusion to include roadside camera-LiDAR fusion, vehicle camera-LiDAR fusion, and vehicle- infrastructure fusion in three pipelines. However, the mAP metric for InfraDet3D and Coopdet3D using only LiDAR on TUMTraf Intersection test set [10] is higher than that for the combination of camera and LiDAR, indicating that more information did not necessarily improve detection performance."}, {"title": "B.

Multi-sensor Fusion", "content": "Multi-sensor fusion enables the complementary functional- ity of data from different modalities, leading to improved performance. The fusion of LiDAR and camera data is one of the most common combinations. Based on the stage of fusion, multi-sensor fusion can be classified into early fusion, deep fusion, and late fusion. Early fusion [15] refers to directly combining the data before processing, such as aligning and projecting point cloud data to minimize data loss. For example, [16] employs LiDAR projections to generate pseudo-images, which are then concatenated with camera images for 2D perception. Deep fusion, also known as feature-level fusion, involves extracting features from the LiDAR branch, such as voxelizing, before further combining them. MVXNet[17], for instance, projects voxelized features into image space to generate regions of interest (ROIs) and encodes features within these ROIs. [18] and [19] incorporate multi-head attention mechanisms to achieve adaptive fusion. Late fusion [7] involves merging the proposals from multiple modalities. Its advantage lies in the flexibility to optimize the model for each branch independently. However, these fusion methods are primarily developed for the ego-vehicle perspective, and there is still much to explore in developing models that perform fusion from the roadside perspective."}, {"title": "III.

The foundational building blocks of most modern deep learning models are MLPs. MLPs essentially use multiple layers of transition matrices and acti- vation functions to approximate complex nonlinear functions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n$MLP (Z) = (W_{K-1} \\circ \\sigma \\circ W_{K-2} \\circ \\sigma \\circ \\cdots\\cdots \\circ W_1 \\circ \\sigma \\circ W_0) Z$ (1)\nThe capacity to approximate complex functions gets better as the number of layers rises. While learning more complicated functions is theoretically possible for a large enough model, it comes at a high computational cost. This makes MLPS parameter inefficient and limits their ability to handle high- dimensional data. To address these issues, Liu et al. [11] proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Similar to MLPs, KANs consist of multiple KAN layers. However, unlike MLPs, where activation functions are applied at the nodes, KANs learn activation functions on the edges. The following is a representation of KANs:\n$KAN (Z) = (\\Phi_{K-1} \\circ \\Phi_{K-2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\Phi_1 \\circ \\Phi_0) Z$ (2)\nwhere $\\Phi_i$ represents the i-th layer of the KANS. For a K\u0391\u039d layer with $n_i$ dimensional input and $n_{i+1}$ dimensional output, \u0424 contains $n_i \\times n_{i+1}$ learnable activation functions, similar to the edges in MLPs. The operation between the i-th and the i+1-th layers in a K-layer KANs is as follows:\n$\\tilde{X}_{i+1,p} = \\sum_{p=1}^{n_i} X_{1,q,p} = \\sum_{p=1}^{n_i} \\Phi_{i,q,p} (X_{i,p}), q = 1,\\ldots,n_{i+1}$ (3)\nIt can also be represented as a matrix as follows:\n$Z_{i+1} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    \\Phi_{i,1,1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{i,1,2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{i,1,n_i} (\\cdot) \\\\\n    \\Phi_{i,2,1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{i,2,2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{i,2,n_i} (\\cdot) \\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots &  & \\vdots \\\\\n    \\Phi_{i,n_{i+1},1} (\\cdot) & \\Phi_{i,n_{i+1},2} (\\cdot) & \\cdots & \\Phi_{i,n_{i+1},n_i} (\\cdot)\n  \\end{pmatrix} Z_i$ (4)\n$\\Phi_i$\nIn this case $\\Phi_{i,q,p}$ represents the sum of basis function b(x) and the spline function.\n$\\phi(x) = w_b b(x) + \\phi(x)$ (5)\n$\\phi(x) = w_s \\text{spline}(x)$ (6)\nIn [11] it is suggested to set $b(x) = \\text{SiLU}(x) = x/ (1 + e^{-x})$.

This module is a multi-head cross-attention mechanism that calculates the dependency between LiDAR and camera features in the BEV space. First, the feature maps of the two branches in this study are of size (768,768). Direct embedding would cause significant memory pressure. Thus, a downsampling layer compresses the features to a size of (128, 128). Then, the embedded representations of the LiDAR and camera features, $E_L$ and $E_C$, are generated with dimensions (b, 128 * 128, c), where b is the batch size and c is the number of channels.\nSince we want to select local regions of the image based on information in the LiDAR features, we use the LiDAR features as the query Q and the image features as the keys K and values V. Using a multi-head attention mechanism ef- fectively stacks n different cross-attentions. The formula for splitting the multi-head attention mechanism is as follows:\n$MultiHead (Q,K,V) = Concat (head_1, head_2, ..., head_n) W^O$ (8)\nwhere each head; is calculated as:\n$Q_i = W^Q E_L, K_i = W^K E_C, V_i = W^V E_C, i = 1,\\ldots,n$ (9)\n$head_i = Cross attention(Q_i, K_i, V_i) = softmax(\\frac{Q_i K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}})V_i$ (10)", "content": null}, {"title": "IV.

The TUMTraf V2X Co- operative Perception Dataset comprises 2,000 labeled point clouds and 5,000 labeled pictures, for a total of 30k 3D bounding boxes. The data was gathered utilizing multi-view high-resolution cameras and LiDARs from both vehicle and roadside perspectives. We focus exclusively on the data collected from roadside facilities. The TUMTraf Intersection Dataset includes 4.8k images and over 57.4k 3D bounding boxes. Since the test set has not been released, we use the validation set to evaluate the model results.\nMetrics To evaluate the accuracy of 3D bounding box detection in this study, we adopted the same evaluation metrics as those used in [10]. The distance and number of points inside the 3D box are used to classify the targets into Hard, Moderate, and Easy classes. Less than 20 points in the box and targets farther than 50 meters are considered hard targets. Objects that are partially occluded, within a distance of 40 to 50 meters, and contain 20 to 50 points are classified as Moderate. Easy targets are those with more than 50 points, less than 40 meters distant, and no occultation.

Multi-head cross-attention is employed to extract relevant features between the two branches, generat- ing feature maps of the same size as the LiDAR features.

No- tably, in both the south 1 and south 2 fields of view, the radar modality of Coopdet3D outperforms the fused camera and radar results. This observation highlights the motivation behind our study. In Kaninfradet3D, by effec- tively integrating valuable information, the camera-LiDAR fusion surpasses the performance of the LiDAR-only branch in Kaninfradet3D. Furthermore, Kaninfradet3D achieves sig- nificant improvements of +9.87 mAP and +10.64 mAP over Coopdet3D in the two different camera views. These im- provements are mainly attributed to the pre-fusion of features using cross-attention and the enhanced feature extraction capabilities of the Encoder module provided by the KAN network.\nAdditionally, we evaluated the model's performance on the TUMTraf V2X Cooperative Perception Dataset under differ- ent difficulty levels, which is depicted in Table II. On this dataset, KanInfraDet3D showed less pronounced improve- ments compared to the previous dataset, achieving +1.96 mAP and +3.05 mAP in the Easy and Moderate categories, respectively.

The comparison is quite clear. The visual characteristics mainly affected a tiny area in front of the camera, and the fused features were primarily reliant on LiDAR data prior to the addition of Camera-LiDAR CrossAttn. In some cases, the fused features showed highly uneven distribution, with extremely high values in regions marked by red circles in the Fig. 3, indicating an abnormal concentration of camera features. This concentration hindered the effective learning of other features in the global context.\nAfter integrating the Camera-LiDAR CrossAttn module, the camera features were more evenly distributed across the LiDAR features rather than being abnormally concentrated in one area. Such abnormal fusion of camera features was common in the original module, but the Camera-LiDAR CrossAttn effectively resolved this issue. After successfully integrating the camera features, not only were the targets with strong LiDAR reflection signals highlighted, but the features of smaller targets in the background, such as pedestrians and motorcycles, also became more distinguishable in the feature map.\nIn Table III, we evaluated the impact of improvements made to each module, with the enhancement from the Camera- LiDAR CrossAttn being the most significant. This demon- strates the critical role of the Camera-LiDAR CrossAttn in camera-LiDAR fusion.

KANConv enhances the learning of complicated features by substituting the original Conv2D layers in the ImageEn- coder and ConvKANfuser. Prior to the fuser, the Camera- LiDARAttn module is added. Its purpose is to pre-fuse features from different branches by calculating multi-head cross-attention on them based on their dependencies. This successfully lessens the detrimental effects on the fusion process of regionally high values in camera characteristics. By utilizing these innovative designs, Kaninfradet3D exhibits exceptional accuracy in roadside 3D perception challenges, offering fresh perspectives on roadside 3D object detection.\nEven though our model works exceptionally well on the training dataset, additional validation on a broader range of datasets is required due to the recent rapid development of roadside 3D perception datasets.

Time series data are extensively utilized in diverse fields, including backend services for monitoring and optimizing IT infrastructure, medical diagnosis through continuous patient monitoring and health trend analysis, and internet business for tracking user behavior and forecasting sales. However, since the effective information in time series data is often hidden in sequence fragments, the uncertainty of their length, quantity, and morphological variables brings challenges to mining. To this end, this paper proposes a new spatiotemporal feature representation method, which converts multidimensional time series (MTS) into one-dimensional event sequences by transforming spatially varying events, and uses a series of event symbols to represent the spatial structural information of multidimensional coupling in the sequence, which has good interpretability. Then, this paper introduces a variable-length tuple mining method to extract non-redundant key event subsequences in event sequences as spatiotemporal structural features of motion sequences. This method is an unsupervised method that does not rely on large-scale training samples and defines a new model for representing the spatiotemporal structural features of multidimensional time series. The superior performance of the STEM model is verified by pattern classification experiments on a variety of motion sequences. The research results of this paper provide an important theoretical basis and technical support for understanding and predicting human behavior patterns, and have far-reaching practical application value.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Time series refers to a series of observations generated by a specific variable that are recorded in sequence within a certain period of time. In the real world, many applied studies in life and industry need to analyze the collected time series data to better understand the laws of things [1]. For example, backend business processing analysis of internet companies utilizes time series data to monitor and optimize server performance, predict system load, and enhance service reliability and efficiency. Similarly, data in the field of medical diagnosis and stock data in the financial market are also forms of time series [2]. Since these types of data have a common attribute-time series, they can all be described in the form of time series. However, the effective information in the time series is usually hidden in the sequence fragments, and the unpredictability of its length, number, and shape variables adds a lot of difficulties to the mining task of time series [3]. Therefore, the analysis of time series needs to obtain information with potential value from historical data as a basis for predicting the future development trend of things, which plays a decisive role in the mining of patterns in time series [4].\n\nThe data values in the time series are arranged in chronological order. Unlike structured data, they are continuous on the time axis, and there is a logical relationship between the previous and subsequent time points (sites), which makes it difficult to directly use traditional data mining methods to carry out research[5]. For multidimensional time series, in addition to the above-mentioned temporal relationships, there are usually linear or nonlinear coupling relationships between the dimensional sequences, which manifests as a complex spatial structure of multidimensional time series[6]. The purpose of feature mining for multidimensional time series is to deeply explore the spatiotemporal structural features contained therein, so as to map the multidimensional time series data into a low-dimensional feature vector space, and provide a structured data representation model for downstream data mining tasks such as multidimensional time series clustering and classification[7,8]. This paper focuses on the problem of interpretable feature extraction of multidimensional coupling, proposes a variety of new methods for spatiotemporal feature mining of multidimensional time series, and applies them to the task of human behavior recognition based on motion sequences, which has important theoretical significance and application value.\n\nFrom the three perspectives of data objects, feature representation methods and feature mining methods, the existing main time series feature mining methods are sorted out, and the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are discussed in combination with different types of data mining tasks and application scenarios, and the sequence mining process framework based on time series data representation is summarized. On this basis, the idea of efficiently mining spatiotemporal structural features based on interpretable subsequences from multidimensional time series is proposed, laying the foundation for subsequent research work."}, {"title": "II. METHOD", "content": "This paper proposes a new method for representing the spatiotemporal structure of optimal prefix subsequences to efficiently extract the spatiotemporal features of motion sequences. First, a transformation method based on spatially varying events is proposed. MTS is converted into a one-dimensional event sequence, and a series of event symbols are used to represent the spatial structural information of multidimensional coupling in the sequence, which has good interpretability; secondly, a variable-length tuple mining method is proposed to extract non-redundant key event subsequences from the event sequence as the spatiotemporal structural features of the motion sequence, which is an unsupervised method that does not rely on large-scale training samples. Based on this, a new model for representing the spatiotemporal structural features of multidimensional time series is defined. Finally, the ideal performance of STEM is verified through pattern classification experiments on multiple motion sequences. \n\nIn the multidimensional time series set S, each sample $X^{(i)}_d$ is a numerical sequence $X^{(i)}_{d1}X^{(i)}_{d2} \\dots X^{(i)}_{dT} \\forall t \\in [1,T]$ in each dimension. In some specific application fields, the length of each sequence sample is different. In this case, let T be the longest sequence length. For sequences shorter than T, the last observation value is appended (that is, it is assumed that the subsequent observation values remain unchanged). In order to analyze the coupling relationship between multidimensional sequences, this paper proposes a method of spatially changing events (SCE) to represent the structure of multidimensional sequences.\n\nFirst, normalize each coordinate sequence to the interval [0,1], then track the direction of movement of each point relative to the previous point starting from the second sequence point, and detect the direction of spatial change based on the relative spatial relationship of the points. As shown in the following formula:\n\n$m_{d t}^{(i)}=\\begin{cases}0 & x_{d(t)}^{(i)}-x_{d(t-1)}^{(i)} < \\delta \\\\1 & x_{d(t)}^{(i)}-x_{d(t-1)}^{(i)} > \\delta \\\\-1 & x_{d(t)}^{(i)}-x_{d(t-1)}^{(i)} < -\\delta\\end{cases}$ (1)\n\nSecondly, construct the sequence space change event SCE and event set E. The D-dimensional combination of symbols shown in the above formula intuitively reflects the coupling relationship between the D-dimensional sequence observations. In view of this, the SCE set is constructed by the permutation and combination of the three symbols in the formula, that is:\n\n$E = \\{0,1,-1\\}^D$ (2)\n\nEach symbol in the sequence data represents the coupling relationship between different dimensions of the data. This representation helps to intuitively illustrate the spatial structure characteristics within the multidimensional sequence, making the data's internal relationships more understandable and interpretable. This ability to visualize and interpret the data's spatial characteristics is crucial for gaining insights into the underlying patterns and interactions present within the sequence. To analyze and extract meaningful features from these sequences, all tuples in the dataset can be organized into a collection of prefix trees, where each tree represents a different subset of the sequence data. These prefix trees are structured hierarchically, with each node representing a specific tuple and paths from the root to the leaf nodes reflecting various sequences of tuples. The Root-to-Leaf Sequence (RTS) features, which are the key features of interest, are distributed along these paths from the root to the leaf nodes in the prefix trees.\n\nTo efficiently mine RTS features, a bottom-up pruning strategy can be employed, similar to the techniques used in decision trees. This approach involves starting from the leaf nodes and progressively moving towards the root, systematically eliminating less significant nodes and paths based on certain criteria. This pruning process helps to narrow down the search space and focus on the most relevant and significant RTS features, improving the overall efficiency of the feature extraction process.\n\nFor illustration, this article provides an example of a prefix tree constructed from 3-tuples"}, {"title": "III.

Datasets", "content": "The experiment used four public datasets from three different application fields. The first dataset, HAR (Human Activity Recognition) [9], is a human activity time series dataset. The data is collected from the embedded 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis angular velocity meter in the smartphone device. The experiment used the 3D time series recorded by tBodyAcc_mx, tBodyAcc_ mean_y and tBodyAcc_mean_z, with lengths ranging from 9 to 47, and divided into four activity types (standing, sitting, walking, and lying). In the table, both datasets are LIBRAS gesture trajectory data, but contain different gesture types. This dataset can be obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [10]. Each gesture action is represented by a 45-dimensional coordinate sequence on its motion trajectory, so it is a fixed-length 2D time series set. LIBRAS1 includes five gesture types: curved-swing, anti-clockwise-arc, vertical-swing, horizontal-swing, and clockwise-arc. The five gesture types of LIBRAS2 are vertical-zigzag, horizontal-wavy, vertical-wavy, circle, and face-up-curve.\n\nThe fourth experimental data is the WISDM dataset from the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) laboratory [11]. Each sample is a three-dimensional time series recording human activities, corresponding to four types of activities: jogging, walking, sitting, and standing. The characteristics of this dataset are that the number of samples is small but the sequence length span is large. This verifies the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper on sequence sets of different numbers and lengths."}, {"title": "C. Experimental Results", "content": "The performance comparison includes classification accuracy and time efficiency.\n\nJudging from the data in Table 1, the average accuracy rates of different sequence representation methods and classifiers on the four data sets of HAR, LIBRAS1, LIBRAS2 and WISDM are different. Our model shows the highest accuracy on all tested datasets, especially on the LIBRAS1 dataset, where the accuracy reaches 0.83, significantly better than other models. In contrast, the traditional CAE model has the weakest performance on these four datasets, with average accuracy ranging from 0.57 to 0.63, while text processing techniques such as TFIDF and N-gram perform well on some datasets. has improved, but is still not as good as the performance of deep learning models such as LSTM, OWBC and T\u0391\u03a1\u039d\u0395\u03a4.\n\nContinuing to observe the data in Table 2 about the CPU time required by different models to complete sequence classification, we can find that our model not only leads in accuracy, but also performs well in computational efficiency. Specifically, our model required the least CPU time on all tested datasets, ranging from 5.2 seconds to 8.9 seconds. In comparison, a model like CAE, although not as accurate as other models, takes 13.7 seconds to complete the classification task on the HAR dataset, which is approximately twice the time required by our model. Even the relatively efficient TAPNET model takes 9.3 seconds to complete the classification task in the slowest case, which shows that our model can effectively reduce the consumption of computing resources while ensuring high accuracy.\n\nIn summary, our model shows significant advantages both from the perspective of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. It not only provides more accurate prediction results on multiple data sets, but also completes the task in a shorter time, which is crucial for practical applications, especially real-time systems. This advantage means that our model can better adapt to the needs of large data volumes and high-speed processing without sacrificing performance, thereby providing users with a more efficient service experience."}, {"title": "IV.

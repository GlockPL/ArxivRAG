While Artificial Intelligence (AI)emerges as a critical and valuable tool for climate change adaptation and mitigation, its effective-ness and potential are contingent upon overcoming significant challenges such as data scarcity, in-frastructure gaps, and limited local AI development. This position paper explores the role of AIin climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa. It advocates for a collaborative approach tobuild capacity, develop open-source data repositories, and create context-aware, robust AI-drivenenvironmental conditions. Additionally, familiarity with both the downstream application domainand specific regional contexts plays a vital role in the modelling stage.", "sections": [{"title": "AI for Climate Resilience in Africa", "content": "The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sixth assessment un-equivocally declares that human-induced climate change manifests in many extreme weather andclimate phenomena globally IPCC (2022). Particularly troubling is the disproportionate impact onvulnerable communities, many of which have contributed minimally to the problem. Regions suchas Central, East, and West Africa have emerged as hotspots of vulnerability, where climate-relatedmortality rates in high vulnerability areas can be as much as 15 times higher than in less vulnerableareas (IPCC, 2022). Moreover, Africa has experienced an accelerated rate of warming, with tempera-tures rising by +0.3 \u00b0C per decade from 1991 to 2022, compared to +0.2 \u00b0C per decade from 1961 to1990 (Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Most African countries are projected to encounter unprecedented hightemperatures earlier this century than wealthier, higher-latitude nations. This warming trend has co-incided with below-average rainfall across much of the continent, exacerbating drought conditions,particularly in the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia (World Meteorological Organization,2022). Meanwhile, other parts of Africa, such as the Sahel and southern regions, have faced the op-posite extreme, with intense rainfall events leading to catastrophic flooding. Africa's livelihoods andnational economies are closely intertwined with climate conditions, with agriculture alone support-ing 55%\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly gaining traction as an essential tool for adaptation and mitigationto climate change. AI applications for climate action are diverse, encompassing climate modellingand forecasting, sustainable energy, transportation, and infrastructure development (Rolnick et al.,2022). These applications clearly demonstrate Al's ability to enhance climate resilience by improvingpredictive capabilities and enabling adaptive responses to climate change. However, the effectivenessof AI is highly contingent upon the availability of robust datasets that capture the complexity of local\nFor example, understanding and modelling bimodal rainfall patterns in East Africa is critical for agri-cultural planning and water resource management. These patterns have significant implications forthe livelihoods of millions of people who depend on rain-fed agriculture and pastoralism (James et al.,2018). Similarly, the African Easterly Jet plays a significant role in shaping the climate of WestAfrica, particularly affecting the monsoon system and consequently agricultural production and foodsecurity in the region (Nicholson, 2009). Despite significant advances in climate modelling in re-cent decades, none of the current suites of General Circulation Models (GCMs) is built by centreson the African continent; thus, representation of the above critical processes is often not a priority(James et al., 2018).\nConsequently, the lack of comprehensive and quality-controlled weather station data in Africa limitsthe ability to evaluate and improve climate models and tailor them to the unique environmentalconditions found across the continent (James et al., 2018). While covering one-fifth of the world'sland area, Africa has the least developed land-based weather station network of any continent, with adensity of weather stations that is only one-eighth of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)requirement (World Meteorological Organization, 2019). This network has also been declining interms of quality and number of stations over time (World Meteorological Organization, 2019; Dinku,2019).\nThis lack of data is compounded by the fact that most climate research funding and AI developmenthave historically been concentrated outside of Africa, using non-African datasets that may not befully applicable or transferable to Africa's environmental and socio-economic conditions (Niang et al.,2014; Dinku et al., 2018). More specifically, IPCC (Barros et al., 2014) shows that only 3.8% of globalfunding for climate research was directed towards Africa, despite the continent's high vulnerabil-ity to the impacts of climate change. Moreover, most of this funding originated outside Africa andwas allocated to non-African research institutions, which underscores data availability and researchfunding as critical limitations.\nAs highlighted by Kull et al. (2021), the performance of Numerical Weather Prediction models, whichform the basis of modern forecasting, heavily relies on the availability of comprehensive and quality-controlled meteorological observations. The sparsity of weather stations across the continent leads tosignificant gaps in understanding atmospheric conditions. This, in turn, translates to lower fore-cast accuracy, particularly for short-range predictions crucial for disaster preparedness and dailydecision-making in weather-sensitive sectors like agriculture, energy, and transportation. Conse-quently, African nations face increased vulnerability to extreme weather events and struggle to op-timise resource management and economic productivity, further exacerbating challenges related tosustainable development and climate change adaptation."}, {"title": "Opportunities to Drive AI for a Climate Resilient Africa", "content": "While there are challenges to using AI for climate action in Africa, there are also opportunities toovercome these barriers. One such opportunity is to leverage grassroots movements for decentralisedresearch and collaboration. These movements facilitate community involvement, garner local knowl-edge, and promote transdisciplinary collaboration. By integrating grassroots initiatives with tradi-tional agricultural practices and local ecological knowledge, AI for climate action can be effectivelyimplemented.\nGrassroots movements have demonstrated success in other areas where Africa is underrepresented intechnology. Examples include Masakhane\u00b9, a movement with over 2000 members actively contribut-ing to the advancement of Natural Language Processing by creating and curating novel datasets andbenchmarks that incorporate African languages (Orife et al., 2020). Another initiative, AfriClimateAI2, is a newly formed grassroots movement focused on addressing Climate Action through open-source data curation, capacity building, and collaboration in pan-African AI-based climate research.The support and success of such movements are core to developing context-aware AI-driven solu-tions across disciplines.\nOpen-source climate information services (CIS), such as those provided by the European Centre forMedium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), have been fundamental in driving exciting advances inclimate informatics, as recent studies have shown. These advances include the development of state-of-the-art models such as IceNet (Andersson et al., 2021), GraphCast (Lam et al., 2022), and NeuralGCM (Kochkov et al., 2023).\nNumerous opportunities arise in the African CIS landscape for collaborative continental efforts. Theseopportunities include building and strengthening weather and climate observation infrastructureand networks for medium and long-term planning, improving the uptake and effectiveness of CISthrough coordinated implementation and sustainability measures, and building capacity in the gen-eration, uptake, and effective use of CIS among various stakeholders (African Union, 2023).\nIn conclusion, we advocate for the creation of a Pan-African roadmap for AI and Climate Science.This roadmap should streamline collaboration among researchers, practitioners, policymakers, andgrassroots communities to tackle the aforementioned challenges. This furthers the proposition byJames et al. (2018), which stresses the need to include African experts in climate model development.It should recognise the opportunity that AI offers to craft context-aware solutions tailored to thecontinent's specific needs and challenges. In addition to placing a significant emphasis on developingand implementing context-aware climate information services that are fit for purpose, this roadmap isenvisaged to cultivate an environment conducive to implementing mitigation and adaptation policiesthat promote a sustainable, prosperous, and climate-resilient Africa."}]}

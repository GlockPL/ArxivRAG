Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our analysis reveals emergent patterns such as the rise of highly connected \"hub\" concepts and the shifting influence of \"bridge\" nodes indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross- domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for open-ended scientific discovery.

In many accounts of discovery, sustained progress arises not from isolated insights but from an iterative process in which prior conclusions are revisited, expressed as generalizable ideas, refined, or even reorganized as new evidence and perspectives emerge [1]. Foundational work in category theory has formalized aspects of this recursive structuring, showing how hierarchical representations can unify diverse knowledge domains and enable higher-level abstractions in both the natural and social sciences [2, 3, 4]. Across engineering disciplines"}, {"title": "1.1 Knowledge Graph Expansion Approaches", "content": "Knowledge graphs are one way to organize relational understanding of the world. They have grown from manually curated ontologies decades ago into massive automatically constructed repositories of facts. A variety of methodologies have been developed for expanding knowledge graphs. Early approaches focused on information extraction from text using pattern-based or open-domain extractors. For example, the DIPRE algorithm [30] bootstrapped relational patterns from a few seed examples to extract new facts in a self-reinforcing loop. Similarly, the KnowItAll system [31] introduced an open-ended, autonomous \"generate- and-test\" paradigm to extract entity facts from the web with minimal supervision. Open Information Extraction methods like TextRunner [32] and ReVerb [33] further enabled unsupervised extraction of subject-predicate-object triples from large text corpora without requiring a predefined schema. These unsupervised techniques expanded knowledge graphs by harvesting new entities and relations from unstructured data, although they often required subsequent mapping of raw extractions to a coherent ontology.\nIn parallel, research on knowledge graph completion has aimed to expand graphs by inferring missing links and attributes. Statistical relational learning and embedding-based models (e.g., translational embeddings like TransE [34]) predict new relationships by generalizing from known graph structures. Such approaches,"}, {"title": "1.2 Recursive and Autonomous Expansion Techniques", "content": "A notable line of work seeks to make knowledge graphs growth continuous and self-sustaining - essentially achieving never-ending expansion. The NELL project (Never-Ending Language Learner) [36] pioneered this paradigm, with a system that runs 24/7, iteratively extracting new beliefs from the web, integrating them into its knowledge base, and retraining itself to improve extraction competence each day. Over years of operation, NELL has autonomously accumulated millions of facts by coupling multiple learners (for parsing, classification, relation extraction, etc.) in a semi-supervised bootstrapping loop. This recursive approach uses the knowledge learned so far to guide future extractions, gradually expanding coverage while self-correcting errors; notably, NELL can even propose extensions to its ontology as new concepts emerge.\nAnother milestone in autonomous knowledge graph construction was Knowledge Vault [37], which demonstrated web-scale automatic knowledge base population by fusing facts from diverse extractors with probabilistic inference. Knowledge Vault combined extractions from text, tables, page structure, and human annotations with prior knowledge from existing knowledge graphs, yielding a vast collection of candidate facts (on the order of 300 million) each accompanied by a calibrated probability of correctness. This approach showed that an ensemble of extractors, coupled with statistical fusion, can populate a knowledge graph at scales far beyond what manual curation or single-source extraction can achieve. Both NELL and Knowledge Vault illustrate the power of autonomous or weakly-supervised systems that grow a knowledge graph with minimal human intervention, using recursive learning and data fusion to continually expand and refine the knowledge repository.\nMore recent research has explored agent-based and reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for knowledge graph expansion and reasoning. Instead of one-shot predictions, these methods allow an agent to make multi-hop queries or sequential decisions to discover new facts or paths in the graph. For example, some work [38] employ an agent that learns to navigate a knowledge graph and find multi-step relational paths, effectively learning to reason over the graph to answer queries. Such techniques highlight the potential of autonomous reasoning agents that expand knowledge by exploring connections in a guided manner (using a reward signal for finding correct or novel information). This idea of exploratory graph expansion aligns with concepts in network science, where traversing a network can reveal undiscovered links or communities. It also foreshadowed approaches like Graph-PReFLexOR [27] that treat reasoning as a sequential decision process, marked by special tokens, that can iteratively build and refine a task-specific knowledge graph.\nApplications of these expansion techniques in science and engineering domains underscore their value for discovery [29]. Automatically constructed knowledge graphs have been used to integrate and navigate scientific literature, enabling hypothesis generation by linking disparate findings. A classic example is Swanson's manual discovery of a connection between dietary fish oil and Raynaud's disease, which emerged by linking two disjoint bodies of literature through intermediate concepts [39, 40]. Modern approaches attempt to replicate such cross-domain discovery in an automated way: for instance, mining biomedical literature to propose new drug-disease links, or building materials science knowledge graphs that connect material properties, processes, and applications to suggest novel materials, engineering concepts, or designs [41, 29]."}, {"title": "1.3 Relation to Earlier Work and Key Hypothesis", "content": "The prior work discussed in Section 1.2 provides a foundation for our approach, which draws on the never- ending learning spirit of NELL [36] and the web-scale automation of Knowledge Vault [37] to dynamically grow a knowledge graph in situ as it reasons. Like those systems, it integrates information from diverse sources and uses iterative self-improvement. However, rather than relying on passive extraction or purely probabilistic link prediction, our method pairs on-the-fly logical reasoning with graph expansion within the construct of a graph-native reasoning LLM. This means each newly added node or edge is both informed by and used for the model's next step of reasoning. Inspired in part by category theory and hierarchical inference, we move beyond static curation by introducing a principled, recursive reasoning loop that helps maintain transparency in how the knowledge graph evolves. In this sense, the work can be seen as a synthesis of existing ideas continuous learning, flexible extraction, and structured reasoning-geared toward autonomous problem-solving in scientific domains.\nDespite substantial progress in knowledge graph expansion, many existing methods still depend on predefined ontologies, extensive post-processing, or reinforce only a fixed set of relations. NELL and Knowledge Vault, for instance, demonstrated how large-scale extraction and integration of facts can be automated, but they rely on established schemas or require manual oversight to refine extracted knowledge [36, 37]. Reinforcement learning approaches such as DeepPath [38] can efficiently navigate existing graphs but do not grow them by generating new concepts or hypotheses.\nBy contrast, the work reported here treats reasoning as an active, recursive process that expands a knowledge graph while simultaneously refining its structure. This aligns with scientific and biological discovery processes, where knowledge is not just passively accumulated but also reorganized in light of new insights. Another key distinction is the integration of preference-based objectives, enabling more explicit interpretability of each expansion step. Methods like TransE [34] excel at capturing statistical regularities but lack an internal record of reasoning paths; our approach, in contrast, tracks and justifies each newly added node or relation. This design allows for a transparent, evolving representation that is readily applied to interdisciplinary exploration such as in biomedicine [39] and materials science [41]\u2014without depending on rigid taxonomies.\nHence, this work goes beyond conventional graph expansion by embedding recursive reasoning directly into the construction process, bridging the gap between passive knowledge extraction and active discovery. As we show in subsequent sections, this self-expanding paradigm yields scale-free knowledge graphs in which emergent hubs and bridge nodes enable continuous reorganization, allowing the system to evolve its understanding without exhaustive supervision and paving the way for scalable hypothesis generation and autonomous reasoning.\nHypothesis. We hypothesize that recursive graph expansion enables self-organizing knowledge formation, allowing intelligence-like behavior to emerge without predefined ontologies, external supervision, or centralized control. Using a pre-trained model, Graph-PReFLexOR (an autonomous graph-reasoning model trained on a corpus of biological and biologically inspired materials principles) we demonstrate that knowledge graphs can continuously expand in a structured yet open-ended manner, forming scale-free networks with emergent conceptual hubs and interdisciplinary bridge nodes. Our findings suggest that intelligence-like reasoning can arise from recursive self-organization, challenging conventional paradigms and advancing possibilities for autonomous scientific discovery and scalable epistemic reasoning."}, {"title": "2 Results and Discussion", "content": "We present the results of experiments in which the graph-native reasoning model engages in a continuous, recursive process of graph-based reasoning, expanding its knowledge graph representation autonomously over 1,000 iterations. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a small number of just a few recursive reasoning steps, the experiments reported in this paper explore how knowledge formation unfolds in an open-ended manner, generating a dynamically evolving graph. As the system iterates, it formulates new tasks, refines reasoning pathways, and integrates emerging concepts, progressively structuring its own knowledge representation following the simple algorithmic paradigm delineated in Figure 1. The resulting graphs from all iterations form a final integrated knowledge graph, which we analyze for structural and conceptual insights. Figure 2 depicts the final state of the graph, referred to as graph G\u2081, after the full reasoning process.\nThe recursive graph reasoning process can be conducted in either an open-ended setting or develoepd into a more tailored manner to address a specific domain or flavor in which reasoning steps are carried out (details, see Materials and Methods). In the example explored here, we focus on designing impact-resistant materials. In this specialized scenario, we initiate the model with a concise, topic-specific prompt - e.g., Describe a way to design impact resistant materials, and maintain the iterative process of extracting structured knowledge from the model's reasoning. We refer to the resulting graph as G2. Despite the narrower focus, the same core principles apply: each new piece of information from the language model is parsed into nodes and edges, appended to a global graph, and informs the next iteration's query. In this way, G2 captures a highly directed and domain-specific knowledge space while still exhibiting many of the emergent structural traits such as hub formation, stable modularity, and growing connectivity\u2014previously seen in the more general graph G1. Figure 3 shows the final snapshot for G2. To further examine the emergent structural organization of both graphs, Figures S1 and S2 display the same graphs with nodes and edges colored"}, {"title": "2.1 Basic Analysis of Recursive Graph Growth", "content": "We now move on to a detailed analysis of the evolution of the graph as the reasoning process unfolds over thinking iterations. This sheds light into how the iterative process dynamically changes the nature of the graph. The analysis is largely focused on G1, albeit a few key results are also included for G2. Detailed methods about how the various quantities are computed are included in Materials and Methods.\nFigure 4 illustrates the evolution of key structural properties of the recursively generated knowledge graph. The number of nodes and edges both exhibit linear growth with iterations, indicating that the reasoning process systematically expands the graph without saturation. The increase in edges is slightly steeper than that of nodes, suggesting that each new concept introduced is integrated into an increasingly dense network of relationships rather than remaining isolated. This continuous expansion supports the hypothesis that the model enables open-ended knowledge discovery through recursive self-organization.\nThe average degree of the graph steadily increases, stabilizing around six edges per node. This trend signifies that the knowledge graph maintains a balance between exploration and connectivity, ensuring that newly introduced concepts remain well-integrated within the broader structure. Simultaneously, the maximum degree follows a non-linear trajectory, demonstrating that certain nodes become significantly more connected over time. This emergent hub formation is characteristic of scale-free networks and aligns with patterns observed in human knowledge organization, where certain concepts act as central abstractions that facilitate higher-order reasoning.\nThe size of the largest connected component (LCC) grows proportionally with the total number of nodes, reinforcing the observation that the graph remains a unified, traversable structure rather than fragmenting into disconnected subgraphs. This property is crucial for recursive reasoning, as it ensures that the system retains coherence while expanding. The average clustering coefficient initially fluctuates but stabilizes around 0.16, indicating that while localized connections are formed, the graph does not devolve into tightly clustered sub-networks. Instead, it maintains a relatively open structure that enables adaptive reasoning pathways.\nThese findings highlight the self-organizing nature of the recursive reasoning process, wherein hierarchical knowledge formation emerges without the need for predefined ontologies or supervised corrections. The presence of conceptual hubs, increasing relational connectivity, and sustained network coherence suggest that the model autonomously structures knowledge in a manner that mirrors epistemic intelligence. This emergent organization enables the system to navigate complex knowledge spaces efficiently, reinforcing the premise that intelligence-like behavior can arise through recursive, feedback-driven information processing. Further analysis of degree distribution and centrality metrics would provide deeper insights into the exact nature of this evolving graph topology."}, {"title": "2.2 Analysis of Advanced Graph Evolution Metrics", "content": "Figure 6 presents the evolution of six advanced structural metrics over recursive iterations, capturing higher- order properties of the self-expanding knowledge graph. These measures provide insights into network organization, resilience, and connectivity patterns emerging during recursive reasoning.\nDegree assortativity coefficient is a measure of the tendency of nodes to connect to others with similar degrees. A negative value indicates disassortativity (high-degree nodes connect to low-degree nodes), while a positive value suggests assortativity (nodes prefer connections to similarly connected nodes). The degree assortativity coefficient (Figure 6(a)) begins with a strongly negative value near -0.25, indicating a disassortative structure where high-degree nodes preferentially connect to low-degree nodes. Over time, assortativity increases and stabilizes around -0.05, suggesting a gradual shift toward a more balanced connectivity structure without fully transitioning to an assortative regime. This trend is consistent with the emergence of hub-like structures, characteristic of scale-free networks, where a few nodes accumulate a disproportionately high number of connections.\nThe global transitivity (Figure 6(b)), measuring the fraction of closed triplets in the network, exhibits an initial peak near 0.35 before rapidly declining and stabilizing towards 0.10, albeit still decreasing. This suggests that early in the recursive reasoning process, the graph forms tightly clustered regions, likely due to localized conceptual groupings. As iterations progress, interconnections between distant parts of the graph increase, reducing local clustering and favoring long-range connectivity, a hallmark of expanding knowledge networks.\nThe k-core Index defines the largest integer k for which a subgraph exists where all nodes have at least k connections. A higher maximum k-core index suggests a more densely interconnected core. The maximum k-core index (Figure 6(c)), representing the deepest level of connectivity, increases in discrete steps, reaching a maximum value of 11. This indicates that as the graph expands, an increasingly dense core emerges, reinforcing the formation of highly interconnected substructures. The stepwise progression suggests that specific iterations introduce structural reorganizations that significantly enhance connectivity rather than continuous incremental growth.\nWe observe that the size of the largest k-core (Figure 6(d)) follows a similar pattern, growing in discrete steps and experiencing a sudden drop around iteration 700 before stabilizing again. This behavior suggests that the graph undergoes structural realignments, possibly due to the introduction of new reasoning pathways that temporarily reduce the dominance of the most connected core before further stabilization.\nBetweenness Centrality is a measure of how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. High betweenness suggests a critical role in information flow, while a decrease indicates decentralization and redundancy in pathways. The average betweenness centrality (Figure 6(e)) initially exhibits high values, indicating that early reasoning iterations rely heavily on specific nodes to mediate information flow. Over time, betweenness declines and stabilizes a bit below 0.01, suggesting that the graph becomes more navigable and distributed, reducing reliance on key bottleneck nodes over more iterations. This trend aligns with the emergence of redundant reasoning pathways, making the system more robust to localized disruptions.\nArticulation points are nodes whose removal would increase the number of disconnected components in the graph, meaning they serve as key bridges between different knowledge clusters. The number of articulation points (Figure 6(f)) steadily increases throughout iterations, reaching over 800. This suggests that as the knowledge graph expands, an increasing number of bridging nodes emerge, reflecting a hierarchical structure where key nodes maintain connectivity between distinct regions. Despite this increase, the network remains well connected, indicating that redundant pathways mitigate the risk of fragmentation.\nA network where the degree distribution follows a power-law, meaning most nodes have few connections, but a small number (hubs) have many (supporting the notion of a scale-free network). Our findings provide evidence that the recursive graph reasoning process spontaneously organizes into a hierarchical, scale-free structure, balancing local clustering, global connectivity, and efficient navigability. The noted trends in assortativity, core connectivity, and betweenness centrality confirm that the system optimally structures its knowledge representation over iterations, reinforcing the hypothesis that self-organized reasoning processes naturally form efficient and resilient knowledge networks."}, {"title": "2.3 Evolution of Newly Connected Pairs", "content": "Figure 7 presents the evolution of newly connected node pairs as a function of iteration, illustrating how the recursive reasoning process expands the knowledge graph over time. This metric captures the rate at which new relationships are established between nodes, providing insights into the self-organizing nature of the network.\nIn the early iterations (0-100), the number of newly connected pairs exhibits high variance, fluctuating between 0 and 400 connections per iteration. This suggests that the initial phase of recursive reasoning leads to significant structural reorganization, where large bursts of new edges are formed as the network establishes its fundamental connectivity patterns. The high variability in this region indicates an exploratory phase, where the graph undergoes rapid adjustments to define its core structure.\nBeyond approximately 200 iterations, the number of newly connected pairs stabilizes around 500-600 per iteration, with only minor fluctuations. This plateau suggests that the knowledge graph has transitioned into a steady-state expansion phase, where new nodes and edges are integrated into an increasingly structured and predictable manner. Unlike random growth, this behavior indicates that the system follows a self-organized expansion process, reinforcing existing structures rather than disrupting them.\nThe stabilization at a high connection rate suggests the emergence of hierarchical organization, where newly introduced nodes preferentially attach to well-established structures. This pattern aligns with the scale-free properties observed in other experimentally acquired knowledge networks, where central concepts continuously accumulate new links, strengthening core reasoning pathways. The overall trend highlights how recursive self-organization leads to sustained, structured knowledge expansion, rather than arbitrary or saturation-driven growth.\nThe observed transition from high-variance, exploratory graph expansion to a stable, structured growth phase suggests that recursive self-organization follows a process similar to human cognitive learning and scientific discovery. We believe that this indicates that in early iterations, the system explores diverse reasoning pathways, mirroring how scientific fields establish foundational concepts through broad exploration before refining them into structured disciplines [1]. The stabilization of connectivity beyond 200 iterations reflects preferential attachment dynamics, a hallmark of scale-free networks where highly connected nodes continue to accumulate new links, much like citation networks in academia [42]. This mechanism ensures that core concepts serve as attractors for further knowledge integration, reinforcing structured reasoning while maintaining adaptability. Importantly, the system does not exhibit saturation or stagnation, suggesting that open-ended knowledge discovery is possible through recursive reasoning alone, without requiring predefined"}, {"title": "2.4 Analysis of Node Centrality Distributions at Final Stage of Reasoning", "content": "Next, Figure 8 presents histograms for three key centrality measures- betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality computed for the recursively generated knowledge graph, at the final iteration. These metrics provide insights into the role of different nodes in maintaining connectivity, network efficiency, and global influence.\nFigure 8(a) shows the distribution of betweenness centrality. We find the distribution of betweenness centrality to be highly skewed, with the majority of nodes exhibiting values close to zero. Only a small fraction of nodes attain significantly higher centrality values, indicating that very few nodes serve as critical intermediaries for shortest paths. This pattern is characteristic of hierarchical or scale-free networks, where a small number of hub nodes facilitate global connectivity, while most nodes remain peripheral. The presence of a few high-betweenness outliers suggests that key nodes emerge as crucial mediators of information flow, reinforcing the hypothesis that self-organizing structures lead to the formation of highly connected bridging nodes.\nFigure 8(b) depicts the closeness centrality distribution. It follows an approximately normal distribution centered around 0.20, suggesting that most nodes remain well-connected within the network. This result implies that the network maintains a compact structure, allowing for efficient navigation between nodes despite continuous expansion. The relatively low spread indicates that the recursive reasoning process prevents excessive distance growth, ensuring that newly introduced nodes do not become isolated. This reinforces the observation that the graph remains navigable as it evolves, an essential property for maintaining coherent reasoning pathways.\nNext, Figure 8(c) shows the eigenvector centrality distribution, identified to be also highly skewed, with most nodes having values close to zero. However, a few nodes attain substantially higher eigenvector centrality scores, indicating that only a select few nodes dominate the network in terms of global influence. This suggests that the network naturally organizes into a hierarchical structure, where dominant hubs accumulate influence over time, while the majority of nodes play a more peripheral role. The emergence of high-eigenvector hubs aligns with scale-free network behavior, further supporting the idea that reasoning-driven recursive self-organization leads to structured knowledge representation.\nThese findings indicate that the recursive knowledge graph balances global connectivity and local modularity, self-organizing into a structured yet efficient system. The few high-betweenness nodes act as key mediators, while the closeness centrality distribution suggests that the network remains efficiently connected. The eigenvector centrality pattern highlights the formation of dominant conceptual hubs, reinforcing the presence of hierarchical knowledge organization within the evolving reasoning framework."}, {"title": "2.5 Knowledge Graph Evolution and Conceptual Breakthroughs", "content": "The evolution of the knowledge graph over iterative expansions discussed so far reveals distinct patterns in knowledge accumulation, conceptual breakthroughs, and interdisciplinary integration. To analyze these processes, we now examine (i) the growth trajectories of major conceptual hubs, (ii) the emergence of new highly connected nodes, and (iii) overall network connectivity trends across iterations. The results of these analyses are presented in Figure 11, which consists of three sub-components.\nThe trajectory of hub development (Figure 10(a)) suggests two primary modes of knowledge accumulation: steady growth and conceptual breakthroughs. Certain concepts, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge Graphs, exhibit continuous incremental expansion, reflecting their persistent relevance in structuring knowledge. In contrast, hubs like Bioluminescent Technology and Urban Ecosystems experience extended periods of low connectivity followed by sudden increases in node degree, suggesting moments when these concepts became structurally significant in the knowledge graph. These results indicate that the system does not expand knowledge in a purely linear fashion but undergoes phases of conceptual restructuring, akin to punctuated equilibrium in scientific development.\nThe emergence of new hubs (Figure 10(b)) further supports this interpretation. Instead of a continuous influx of new central concepts, we observe discrete bursts of hub formation occurring at specific iteration milestones. These bursts likely correspond to the accumulation of contextual knowledge reaching a critical threshold, after which the system autonomously generates new organizing principles to structure its expanding knowledge base. This finding suggests that the system's reasoning process undergoes alternating cycles of consolidation and discovery, where previously formed knowledge stabilizes before new abstract concepts emerge."}, {"title": "2.6 Structural Evolution of the Knowledge Graph", "content": "The expansion of the knowledge graph over iterative refinements reveals emergent structural patterns that highlight how knowledge communities form, how interdisciplinary connections evolve, and how reasoning complexity changes over time. These dynamics provide insight into how autonomous knowledge expansion follows systematic self-organization rather than random accumulation. Figure 11 presents three key trends: (a) the formation and growth of knowledge sub-networks, (b) the number of bridge nodes that connect different knowledge domains, and (c) the depth of multi-hop reasoning over iterations.\nFigure 11(a) illustrates the formation of knowledge sub-networks over time. The number of distinct communities increases as iterations progress, reflecting the system's ability to differentiate between specialized fields of knowledge. The trend suggests two key observations: (i) an early rapid formation of new communities as novel knowledge domains emerge and (ii) a later stage where the number of communities stabilizes with occasional fluctuations. The latter behavior indicates that rather than indefinitely forming new disconnected knowledge clusters, the system reaches a regime where previously distinct domains remain relatively stable while undergoing minor structural reorganizations. The fluctuations in the later stages may correspond to moments where knowledge clusters merge or when new abstractions cause domain shifts.\nFigure 11(b) tracks the number of bridge nodes (concepts that serve as interdisciplinary connectors) over iterative expansions. The steady, almost linear increase in bridge nodes suggests that as knowledge expands, more concepts naturally emerge as crucial links between different domains. This behavior reflects the self-reinforcing nature of knowledge integration, where new ideas not only expand within their respective fields but also introduce new ways to connect previously unrelated disciplines. Interestingly, there is no evidence of saturation in the number of bridge nodes, implying that the graph remains highly adaptive, continuously uncovering interdisciplinary relationships without premature convergence. This property is reminiscent of human knowledge structures, where interdisciplinary connections become more prevalent as scientific inquiry deepens.\nFigure 11(c) examines the depth of multi-hop reasoning over iterations by measuring the average shortest path length in the graph. Initially, reasoning depth fluctuates significantly, which corresponds to the early phase of knowledge graph formation when structural organization is still emergent. As iterations progress, the average path length stabilizes, indicating that the system achieves a balance between hierarchical depth and accessibility of information. The early fluctuations may be attributed to the rapid reorganization of knowledge, where some paths temporarily become longer as new concepts emerge before stabilizing into more efficient reasoning structures. The eventual stabilization suggests that the graph reaches an equilibrium in how information propagates through interconnected domains, maintaining reasoning efficiency while still allowing for complex inferential pathways.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the autonomous knowledge expansion model exhibits structured self-organization, balancing specialization and integration. The interplay between distinct community formation, interdisciplinary connectivity, and reasoning depth highlights the emergence of a dynamically evolving but structurally coherent knowledge network. The continuous increase in bridge nodes reinforces the idea that interdisciplinary reasoning remains a central feature throughout the system's expansion, which may have significant implications for autonomous discovery processes. Future analyses will explore whether certain bridge nodes exhibit long-term persistence as central knowledge connectors or if interdisciplinary pathways evolve dynamically based on newly introduced concepts."}, {"title": "2.7 Persistence of Bridge Nodes in Knowledge Evolution", "content": "To understand the structural stability of interdisciplinary connections, we further analyze the persistence of bridge nodes concepts that act as connectors between distinct knowledge domains, over multiple iterations. Figure 12 presents a histogram of bridge node lifespans, showing how long each node remained an active bridge in the knowledge graph.\nThe distribution in Figure 12 suggests that knowledge graph connectivity follows a hybrid model of structural evolution. The majority of bridge nodes appear only for a limited number of iterations, reinforcing the hypothesis that interdisciplinary pathways frequently evolve as new concepts emerge and replace older ones. This aligns with earlier observations that the knowledge system exhibits a high degree of conceptual dynamism.\nHowever, a subset of bridge nodes remains persistent for hundreds of iterations. These nodes likely correspond to fundamental concepts that sustain long-term interdisciplinary connectivity. Their extended presence suggests that the system does not solely undergo continuous restructuring; rather, it maintains a set of core concepts that act as stable anchors in the evolving knowledge landscape.\nThese results refine our earlier observations by distinguishing between transient interdisciplinary connections and long-term structural stability. While knowledge graph expansion is dynamic, certain foundational concepts maintain their bridging role, structuring the broader knowledge network over extended periods. This hybrid model suggests that autonomous knowledge expansion does not operate under complete conceptual turnover but instead converges toward the emergence of stable, high-impact concepts that persist across iterations.\nRelated questions that could be explored in future research is whether these persistent bridge nodes correspond to widely used theoretical frameworks, methodological paradigms, or cross-domain knowledge principles. Additionally, further analysis is needed to examine whether long-term bridge nodes exhibit distinct topological properties, such as higher degree centrality or clustering coefficients, compared to short-lived connectors."}, {"title": "2.8 Early Evolution of Bridge Nodes in Knowledge Expansion", "content": "To examine the mechanics of the formation of interdisciplinary connections in the early stages of knowledge graph evolution, we pay close attention to the process. In the analysis discussed here, we identify the first occurrences of bridge nodes over the initial 200 iterations. Figure 13 presents a binary heatmap, where each row represents a bridge node, and each column corresponds to an iteration. The bridge nodes are sorted by the iteration in which they first appeared, providing a clearer view of how interdisciplinary connectors emerge over time.\nThe heatmap in Figure 13 reveals several key trends in the evolution of bridge nodes. Notably, the earliest iterations feature a rapid influx of bridge nodes, reflecting the initial structuring phase of the knowledge graph. Many nodes appear and remain active for extended periods, suggesting that certain concepts establish themselves as core interdisciplinary connectors early in the process. These nodes likely play a foundational role in structuring knowledge integration across domains.\nA second notable pattern is the episodic emergence of new bridge nodes, rather than a continuous accumulation. The visualization shows distinct clusters of newly appearing bridge nodes, interspersed with periods of relative stability. These bursts suggest that knowledge integration occurs in structured phases rather than through gradual accumulation. Such phases may represent moments when the system reaches a threshold where newly integrated concepts allow for the creation of previously infeasible interdisciplinary links.\nIn contrast to the early-established bridge nodes, a subset of nodes appears only in later iterations. These late-emerging bridge nodes indicate that interdisciplinary roles are notably not static; rather, the system continuously restructures itself, incorporating new ideas as they gain relevance. This supports the hypothesis that certain bridge nodes emerge not from initial structuring but from later stages of conceptual refinement, possibly as higher-order abstractions connecting previously developed knowledge clusters.\nThe distribution of bridge node activity also suggests a mix of persistent and transient connectors. While some nodes appear briefly and disappear, others remain active over long stretches. This behavior reinforces the idea that knowledge expansion is both dynamic and structured, balancing exploration (where new connections are tested) and stabilization (where key interdisciplinary links persist).\nWe note that the structured emergence of bridge nodes may indicate that interdisciplinary pathways do not form randomly but are shaped by systematic phases of knowledge integration and refinement. Future analyses could explore the long-term impact of early bridge nodes, assessing whether they remain influential throughout the knowledge graph's evolution, and whether the structure of interdisciplinary connectivity stabilizes or continues to reorganize over extended iterations."}, {"title": "2.9 Evolution of Key Bridge Nodes Over Iterations", "content": "To investigate how interdisciplinary pathways evolve in the knowledge graph, we analyzed the betweenness centrality of the most influential bridge nodes across 1,000 iterations. Figure 14 presents the trajectory of the top 10 bridge nodes, highlighting their shifting roles in facilitating interdisciplinary connections.\nThe trends in Figure 14 reveal distinct patterns in how bridge nodes emerge, peak in influence, and decline over time. Notably, nodes such as Closed-Loop Life Cycle Design and Human Well-being exhibit high betweenness centrality in the early iterations, suggesting that they played a fundamental role in structuring the initial interdisciplinary landscape. However, as the knowledge graph expanded, these nodes saw a gradual decline in their centrality, indicating that their role as primary connectors was replaced by alternative pathways.\nA second class of bridge nodes, including Adaptability and Resilience of Cities and Artificial Intelligence (AI), maintained high centrality values for a longer duration, suggesting that certain concepts remain essential to interdisciplinary knowledge integration even as the graph evolves. These nodes acted as long-term knowledge stabilizers, facilitating interactions between different research domains throughout a significant portion of the knowledge expansion process.\nInterestingly, a subset of nodes, such as Feedback Mechanism and Outcome, gradually gained importance over time. Unlike early bridge nodes that peaked and declined, these nodes started with lower centrality but increased in influence in later iterations. This suggests that some interdisciplinary pathways only become critical after sufficient knowledge accumulation, reinforcing the idea that interdisciplinary roles are not static but continuously reorganize as the knowledge graph matures.\nFurthermore, we observe that by approximately iteration 400-600, most bridge nodes' betweenness centrality values begin converging toward lower values, indicating that knowledge transfer is no longer reliant on a small set of nodes. This suggests that, as the graph expands, alternative pathways develop, leading to a more distributed and decentralized knowledge structure where connectivity is no longer dominated by a few highly influential nodes.\nThese findings support the hypothesis that interdisciplinary pathways evolve dynamically, with early-stage knowledge formation relying on a few key concepts, followed by a transition to a more robust and distributed network where multiple redundant pathways exist. Future analyses will focus on:\n\u2022 Identifying which nodes replaced early bridge nodes as major interdisciplinary connectors in later iterations.\n\u2022 Comparing early vs. late-stage bridge nodes to assess whether earlier nodes tend to be general concepts, while later bridge nodes represent more specialized interdisciplinary knowledge.\n\u2022 Analyzing the resilience of the knowledge graph by simulating the removal of early bridge nodes to determine their structural significance.\nThese results provide a perspective on how interdisciplinary linkages emerge, stabilize, and reorganize over time, offering insights into the self-organizing properties of large-scale knowledge systems."}, {"title": "2.10 Evolution of Betweenness Centrality Distribution", "content": "To analyze the structural evolution of the knowledge graph, we next examine the distribution of betweenness centrality at different iterations. Betweenness centrality is a measure of a node's importance in facilitating knowledge transfer between different parts of the network. Formally, the betweenness centrality of a node $v$ is given by:\n$C_B(v) = \\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}$\nwhere $\\sigma_{st}$ is the total number of shortest paths between nodes $s$ and $t$, and $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those paths that pass through $v$. A higher betweenness centrality indicates that a node serves as a critical intermediary in connecting disparate knowledge domains.\nFigure S3 presents histograms of betweenness centrality distribution at four key iterations (2, 100, 510, and 1024), illustrating the shifting role of bridge nodes over time.\nInitially, at Iteration 2, the network is highly centralized, with a small number of nodes exhibiting extremely high betweenness centrality (above 0.6), while the majority of nodes have near-zero values. This indicates that only a few nodes act as critical interdisciplinary connectors, facilitating nearly all knowledge transfer.\nBy Iteration 100, the distribution has broadened, meaning that more nodes participate in knowledge transfer. The highest betweenness values have decreased compared to Iteration 2, and more nodes exhibit low but nonzero centrality, suggesting an increase in redundant pathways and reduced dependency on a few dominant bridge nodes.\nAt Iteration 510, the distribution becomes more skewed again, with fewer nodes having high betweenness centrality and a stronger concentration at low values. This suggests that the network has undergone a phase of structural consolidation, where interdisciplinary pathways reorganize around fewer, more stable bridges.\nFinally, at Iteration 1024, the histogram shows that most nodes have low betweenness centrality, and only a few retain moderate values. This suggests that the network has matured into a more distributed structure, where no single node dominates knowledge transfer. The observed trend indicates that as the knowledge graph expands, the burden of interdisciplinary connectivity is increasingly shared among many nodes rather than concentrated in a few.\nThese results suggest that the system undergoes a dynamic reorganization process, shifting from an initial hub-dominated structure to a more distributed and resilient network. Future work could potentially explore whether these trends continue as the graph scales further and whether the eventual network state remains stable or undergoes additional restructuring."}, {"title": "2.12 Analysis of longest shortest path in G2 and analysis using agentic reasoning", "content": "While the primary focus of this study is targeting a detailed analysis of graph dynamic experiments during reasoning, we also explore how graph reasoning based on the in-situ generated graph can be used to improve responses through in-context learning [11"}]}

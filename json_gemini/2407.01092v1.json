Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), initially proposed\nby LeCun et al. [1], have become a cornerstone in this domain due to their ability to efficiently process high-\ndimensional data arrays such as images. These networks typically employ linear transformations followed by activation\nfunctions in their convolutional layers to discern spatial relationships, thereby reducing the number of parameters\nneeded to capture intricate patterns in visual data. Since 2012, following the success of AlexNet [2] in the ImageNet\nclassification challenge, CNNs have dominated the field of computer vision until the emergence of Vision Transformers\n[3]. Innovations such as Residual Networks [4] and Densely Connected networks [5], along with numerous subsequent\nworks, have significantly advanced the achievable quality of models based on convolutional layers, enabling the effective\ntraining of very large and deep networks.\nIn segmentation tasks, especially within the biomedical domain, CNNs have also become foundational with the advent of\nthe U-Net [6] architecture, which has subsequently inspired a whole family of U-Net-like architectures for segmentation\ntasks.\nRecent developments in deep learning have seen the integration of sophisticated mathematical theories into neural\nnetwork architectures, enhancing their capability to handle complex data structures. One such innovation is the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) [7], which leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem to incorporate splines into\nits architecture, offering a compelling alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

The theorem, which provides a way to represent\nany multivariate continuous function as a composition of univariate functions and additions, has been adapted in the\ndesign of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). KANs differ from traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by\nreplacing linear weight matrices with learnable splines, thus reducing the number of parameters required and potentially\nimproving the generalization capabilities of the network.\nRecent research has proposed several variations of KANs to address specific limitations and enhance their performance.\nFast KAN by Li et al. (2024) introduced an adaptation where B-splines are replaced by Radial Basis Functions (RBFs).\nThis modification aims to reduce the computational overhead associated with splines. The work demonstrated that\nthird-order B-splines used in traditional KANs could be effectively approximated by Gaussian radial basis functions,\nresulting in FastKAN-a faster implementation of KAN which also functions as an RBF network.\nWavelet-based KANs (Wav-KAN), as presented by Bozorgasl et al.

Additionally, we introduce Focal KAGN Modulation, where all convolutional\nlayers in the original focal modulation are replaced with Kolmogorov-Arnold convolutional layers."}, {"title": "3.1 Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions", "content": "Kolmogorov-Arnold convolutions were presented in [9], in this section we briefly cover the formalization of Kolmogorov-\nArnold convolutions.\nKolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions could be stated as follows: the kernel consists of a set of univariate non-linear\nfunctions. Suppose we have an input image $y$, $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times n \\times m}$, where $c$ is the number of channels, and $n, m$ are the height\nand width of an image respectively. Then, KAN-based convolutions with kernel size $k$ could be defined as:\n$x_{ij} = \\sum_{d=1}^{c} \\sum_{a=0}^{k-1} \\sum_{b=0}^{k-1} \\phi_{a,b,d}(y_{d,i+a,j+b}); i = \\overline{1, n - k + 1}, j = \\overline{1,m - k + 1}$\nEach $\\phi$ is a univariate non-linear learnable function with its own trainable parameters. In the original paper[7], the\nauthors propose to use this form of the functions:\n$\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi &= w_b \\cdot b(x) + \\psi(x), \\\\\n\\psi(x) &= w_s \\cdot Spline(x) \\\\\nb(x) &= SiLU(x) = x/(1+e^{-x})\n\\end{aligned}$\nSimilar to KANs, other than splines could be chosen as basis function $\\phi(x)$: Radial-Basis Function, Wavelets,\npolynomials, etc.\nReplacing splines with Gram polynomials was proposed in [14]. The Gram polynomials, or the discrete Chebyshev\npolynomial, $t_n (x)$ is a polynomial of degree n in x, for $n = 0, 1, 2, ..., N - 1$, constructed such that two polynomials\nof unequal degree are orthogonal with respect to the weight function $w(x) = \\sum_{r=0}^{N-1} \\delta(x-r)$, with $\\delta(\\cdot)$ being the Dirac\ndelta function. That is, $\\int t_n(x) t_m(x) w(x) dx = 0$ if $n \\neq m$. In the case of splines by Gram polynomials,\nKAN Convolutions are defined as follows.\n$\\begin{aligned}\n\\phi &= w_b \\cdot b(x) + \\psi(x), \\\\\n\\psi(x) &= \\sum_{i=0}^{N+1} w_i t_i(x) \\\\\nb(x) &= SiLU(x) = x/(1+e^{-x})\n\\end{aligned}$\nThis reformulation, on one side, allows an option for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the pre-trained model, and on\nthe other hand, it reduces the number of trainable parameters."}, {"title": "3.2 Bottleneck Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions", "content": "The main problem with KAN Convolutions lies in the Spline part of the model. Whatever type of basis function\none chooses, the basis introduces a lot of parameters to the model, which leads to higher resource requirements\nduring training and increases the probability of overfitting. To overcome those issues, we propose to use Bottleneck\nKolmogorov-Arnold Convolutions (see Fig.1).\nBefore applying basis to input data, we propose to use squeezing convolution with kernel size equal to 1 before applying\nbasis function to input and expanding convolution with kernel size equal to 1 after. Intuitively, it could be considered a\none-layer encoder that helps extract meaningful features from the input before processing it via a chosen basis, and then\na one-layer decoder decodes it back. residual activation helps to preserve necessary details that could be lost during\nencoding and decoding of the input."}, {"title": "3.3 Kolmogorov-Arnold Sefl-Attention and Focal Modulation", "content": "In [16], a self-attention layer was introduced where the K, Q, and V projections were replaced by convolutional layers\ninstead of linear projections. In this paper, we propose a similar approach to construct Self-KAGtention layers by\nsubstituting traditional convolutions with KAN convolutional layers. Given that the self-attention operation requires\nO(n\u00b2) memory, where n is the number of tokens or tensor pixels in convolutional models, we suggest using optional\nbottleneck convolutions with a 1 \u00d7 1 kernel and placing the self-attention layer between these two convolutions.

[17] introduce the Focal Modulation layer to serve as a seamless replacement for the Self-Attention Layer.\nThe layer boasts high interpretability, making it a valuable tool for Deep Learning practitioners. Here we propose a\nFocal KAGN Modulation, where all convolutional layers from the original focal modulation are replaced with KAN\nconvolutional layers. As the Focal Modulation layer uses grouped convolutions in the hierarchical contextualization\nstream of data processing with the number of groups equals to the filter number, we note that in this case, Bottleneck\nKAN Convolutions should be replaced by KAN Convolutions."}, {"title": "3.4 Regularizations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutional", "content": "Applying regularization techniques to Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolutional involves straightforward weight and activation\npenalties. However, dropout requires careful consideration of its placement. Let's describe the polynomial version of\nKolmogorov-Arnold Convolutional. Instead of computing splines over x, we could use Gram, Chebyshev, Legendre,\nand other Polynomials. In this case, we first need to compute the polynomial basis over x, and then perform the\nweighted sum of. (Fig.3). In that case, we have 3 possible options for dropout placement: before the layer (we will refer\nto this position as \"Full\"), before polynomial basis calculation (we will refer to this position as \"Poly\"), and before\nweight application to polynomials (we will refer to this position as \"Degree\").\nThe authors of [7] state the benefits of KANs over MLPs, and one of them was robustness to noise and adversarial\nattacks. From this observation, we could derive an alternative way of regularization. Instead of zeroing out some\nfraction of neurons, we could add additive Gaussian noise to a layer's input, thus forcing the model to filter this noise\nand be more robust against noise in unseen data. Similar to dropout, there are three placements available: \"Full\", \"Poly\",\nand \"Degree\".

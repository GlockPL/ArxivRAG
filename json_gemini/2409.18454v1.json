The process typically includes several key steps: text analysis to understand document structure and themes, information ex-traction to identify relevant content, content selection to choose the most important el-ements, summary generation, and quality evaluation [1].\nTraditional approaches to summarization fall into two main categories: extractive and abstractive methods. Extractive summarization selects and arranges existing sen-tences or phrases from the source document, while abstractive summarization generates new text to capture the core concepts [2].\nExtractive techniques often rely on statistical measures of word frequency, sentence position, and other surface-level features to identify important content [1]. More ad-vanced extractive methods use graph-based algorithms to model relationships between"}, {"title": "Challenges in Multi-Document Summarization", "content": "While these traditional techniques can be effective for single documents, they face significant challenges when applied to multi-document summarization:\nRedundancy: Information is often repeated across multiple source documents, lead-ing to repetitive summaries if not properly managed [4].\nCoherence: Extracting sentences from different documents can result in disjointed summaries lacking logical flow [5].\nContext preservation: It is challenging to maintain the broader context when com-bining information from diverse sources [6], leading to summaries that lack focus or miss key points[11].\nScalability: Processing and synthesizing information from many documents in-creases computational complexity [10]. This challenge persists even with advanced models, as handling very long or numerous documents remains computationally inten-sive [14].\nCross-document relationships: Capturing connections and contradictions between documents is difficult for methods focused on individual sentences or documents [7].\nDomain adaptation: Traditional methods can be limited in their flexibility and adapt-ability to handle diverse document structures and writing styles [9]. Techniques opti-mized for one type of document may not generalize well to other domains or writing styles [12]. This challenge extends to ensuring models can handle varied document for-mats, styles, and topics [59].\nFactual consistency: Ensuring that generated summaries remain faithful to the source material is crucial, especially for abstractive methods [66]. This challenge is particu-larly pronounced in abstractive summarization, where preventing \"hallucinations\" or factual errors remains an active area of research [65].\nEthical considerations: As summarization techniques become more advanced, miti-gating biases present in training data and ensuring fairness in generated summaries be-comes increasingly important [63]."}, {"title": "Large Language Models for Document Summarization", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to address many of these challenges in multi-document summarization. These models, based on transformer architectures [13], can process and understand much longer sequences of text than previous approaches. This allows them to capture broader context and rela-tionships across multiple documents [14].\nKey advantages of LLMs for multi-document summarization include:\nContextual understanding: Self-attention mechanisms allow LLMs to model long-range dependencies and capture document-level context [15].\nRedundancy handling: LLMs can identify and consolidate repeated information across sources [16].\ncoherent and contextually consistent summaries: the hierarchical structure of LLMs allows them to model the inherent structure of documents, which can create more co-herent and contextually consistent summaries [17].\nAbstractive capabilities: Through pre-training on vast corpora, LLMs develop strong language generation abilities, enabling more natural abstractive summaries [18].\nScalability: Techniques like sparse attention [20] allow LLMs to efficiently process very large inputs.\nTransfer learning: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific summarization tasks while leveraging general language understanding [19, 21]."}, {"title": "Domain-Specific Applications", "content": "Researchers have begun exploring the application of LLMs to multi-document sum-marization in various specialized domains:\nLegal: LLMs show promise in summarizing complex legal documents, extracting key arguments and precedents [46]. This can significantly improve efficiency for legal professionals reviewing large case files [47].\nMedical: In the medical field, LLMs are being used to synthesize findings from mul-tiple research papers, supporting evidence-based practice [49]. They can also summa-rize patient records and clinical conversations to aid healthcare providers [52].\nNews: LLMs enable the aggregation of multiple news sources to provide compre-hensive event summaries, potentially reducing bias by incorporating diverse viewpoints [53, 55].\nThese domain-specific applications highlight the adaptability of LLMs to different types of documents and summarization needs. However, they also underscore the im-portance of addressing potential biases and ensuring factual accuracy, especially in sen-sitive domains [62, 65].\nLong context understanding within large language models is crucial for document summarization tasks requiring a deep understanding of language semantics, coherence, and context. Long Context LLMs offer a powerful approach to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in multi-document summarization. By capturing long-range de-pendencies, handling redundancy, generating coherent abstracts, and scaling to large document collections, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize the field of multi-doc-ument summarization and enable the creation of more accurate, informative, and user-friendly summaries.

An LLM's pre-training on diverse datasets allows for effective transfer learning to the multi-document summarization task."}, {"title": "Context Management", "content": "Context Management: In order, to reduce the complexity of managing longer context we have selected Long-context LLMs, however, even explicit Long-context LLMs may suffer from losing the context when relevant context appears in the middle of a very long text [26], hence managing long contexts is critical for effective summarization. Sliding window, hierarchical attention and use of memory- augmented networks are some of the strategies that are effective. Sliding Window involves dividing the text into overlapping segments to ensure the model captures context across sections. [27]. In Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms layers of attention are implemented to focus on different levels of text (e.g., paragraphs, sentences) for better context retention. [28]. Memory-augmented networks, such as the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) [29] and the Memory Attention Network (MAN) [30], are integrated with the LLMs to en-able dynamic context retrieval and information storage during the summarization pro-cess where it employs external memory structures to dynamically store and retrieve context information, enhancing the model's ability to reference long-range dependen-cies.\nInformation Extraction: This is a crucial step in multi-document summarization, that involves identifying and organizing key pieces of information across multiple docu-ments to generate coherent and comprehensive summaries. Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE) and coreference resolution are the techniques most used in Information Extraction step where NER helps to identify and classify entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other important terms within the text and RE assists to identify relationships between entities, such as who did what to whom, when, and where [31]. Coreference Resolution aims to identify, and link men-tions of the same entity across different parts of the text or across multiple documents [32]. By applying NER to the input documents, LLM can recognize and extract key entities that are central to the information being summarized [33]. The extracted entities serve as anchors for linking and integrating information across multiple documents. LLMs can utilize RE techniques to uncover the connections and interactions among the"}, {"title": "Workflow Analysis for Leveraging LLMs in Multi-Document Summarization", "content": "extracted entities, providing a deeper understanding of the information structure [34]. Extracting relations helps in establishing the context and coherence of the information being summarized. By applying Coreference Resolution, LLMs can establish connec-tions between related entities and events, even if they are referred to using different expressions [35]. This helps in creating a unified representation of the information and avoids redundancy in the generated summary.\nInformation Integration: In this step, the extracted entities and relations are used to construct knowledge graphs that capture the interconnections and hierarchical structure of the information [36]. These knowledge graphs aid in maintaining coherence and con-sistency during summary generation.\nSummary Generation: In this steps extractive and abstractive summarization ap-proaches are combined by employing the hybrid approach [37]. Extractive methods are used to identify the most salient sentences, while abstractive methods generate concise and fluent summaries. This approach ensures coherence, consistency, and relevance in the generated summaries: To ensure the quality of the generated summaries, techniques such as coherence modeling [38], consistency checking [39], and relevance scoring [40] are incorporated. These techniques help in maintaining the logical flow, factual accu-racy, and pertinence of the summaries to the input documents."}, {"title": "Applications and Case Studies", "content": "In this section we discuss the application and case studies for using long-context large language models (LLMs) for multi-document summarization in the legal domain, med-ical field, news industry and enterprise application use cases."}, {"title": "Legal Domain", "content": "Problem statement: A legal firm needs to summarize a large collection of legal docu-ments related to a complex corporate litigation case.

The approach integrates advanced signal processing, clustering, and visual analytics to identify subsurface anomalies. A unique adaptive thresholding method tailors frequency-based defect identification to the distinct material properties of each slab. The methodology generates frequency maps, binary masks, and k-means cluster maps to automatically classify defect and non-defect regions. Key visualizations, including 3D surface plots, cluster maps, and contour plots, are employed to analyze spatial frequency distributions and highlight structural anomalies. The study utilizes a labeled dataset of eight reinforced concrete specimens constructed at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory, each containing known artificial defects. Evaluations involve ground-truth masking, comparing the generated defect maps with top-view binary masks derived from the information provided by the FHWA. The performance metrics, specifically F1-scores and AUC-ROC, achieve values of up to 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, consistently identifying defect-prone areas with minimal false positives and few missed defects. Adaptive frequency thresholding ensures flexibility in addressing variations across slabs, providing a scalable framework for detecting structural anomalies. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable to other frequency-based signals due to its generalizable thresholding mechanism. This automated and scalable pipeline minimizes manual intervention, ensuring accurate and efficient defect detection in structural health monitoring. Moreover, this approach holds potential for integrating multimodal sensor fusion in infrastructure maintenance and monitoring, further advancing Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The structural health of concrete infrastructure, such as bridge decks and other critical public assets, is a growing concern due to the presence of subsurface defects that com- promise their safety and durability [6], [17]. Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) methods have become indispensable for assessing concrete structures, enabling the detection of internal anomalies without causing damage [6]. Among these tech- niques, the Impact Echo (IE) method has shown promise in detecting subsurface flaws by analyzing frequency responses generated through mechanical impacts [8], [15], [16]. This capability makes IE highly suitable for inspecting concrete structures, particularly bridge decks, where defects often re- main concealed. However, the application of IE in practice faces significant challenges. Traditional approaches are often limited to single-layer conditions and rely on static, predefined threshold values for defect detection [8], [10]. These methods struggle to adapt to the unique characteristics of individ- ual slabs, particularly in complex structures where material properties and environmental factors vary [12]. Furthermore, existing studies on IE typically rely on manually defined thresholds that fail to account for variations in material and structural properties across different slabs, potentially leading to inaccurate detection and limited reproducibility.\nThis pilot study addresses these challenges by introducing a fully automated, frequency-adaptive methodology tailored to concrete structures. Our approach leverages adaptive fre- quency thresholds based on the unique frequency signatures of each slab, enabling precise detection of defect-prone areas. Instead of focusing on specific defect types, the methodology emphasizes identifying and localizing regions that may contain structural anomalies. The spatial mapping of these regions is enhanced through advanced visualizations, including contour plots, three-dimensional (3D) surface plots, cluster maps, and histogram plots, which provide interpretable insights into defect-prone areas.\nThis study uses the dataset sourced from the Federal High- way Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation laboratory, which comprises stan- dardized, laboratory-controlled data on concrete slabs with known artificial defects designed to simulate bridge defects and facilitate the evaluation of structural anomalies using different NDE methods [6]. This dataset is characterized by its spatial structure and controlled conditions, which enables reliable analysis and validation of our adaptive methodology."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "NDE techniques are essential for detecting defects in con- crete structures, such as bridge decks, slabs, and walls. Var- ious NDE methods, including IE, Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR), Ultrasonic Surface Wave (USW), and Electrical Resis- tivity (ER), are widely used to assess the health of concrete structures, especially for detecting delamination, cracks, and corrosion of reinforcing steel [6], [17]. Among these, the IE method stands out for its ability to detect subsurface anomalies by measuring frequency shifts of transient stress waves [16]. This method is particularly effective in detecting delamination and cracks, with several studies detailing its application to bridge decks and slabs [16], [17].\nThe use of IE signals for bridge defect detection has been extensively studied, employing various advanced techniques, such as signal transformation [11], [12], Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) [15], frequency analysis [13], [22], [25], statistical pattern recognition [22], and Machine Learning (ML) [2], [10], [13], [20], [21]. The IE method is also widely applied in assessing concrete slabs, as documented in FHWA studies [1], [6], [17]. These studies identify subsurface anomalies such as delamination, cracks, and voids through structured grid patterns and frequency response analysis, cor- relating frequency shifts with structural anomalies. Despite its strengths, IE faces challenges such as sensitivity to noise and reliance on predefined frequency thresholds, which our work addresses through dynamic frequency thresholds and clustering-based defect detection."}, {"title": "A. Frequency Analysis for IE Signals", "content": "Frequency analysis, particularly using Fast Fourier Trans- form (FFT), is extensively used to identify specific frequencies linked to defects such as cracks, voids, and delamination [13]. Studies, such as those by Liu et al. [25] and Sajid et al. [22], demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral response analysis for detecting and categorizing defects. Additionally, methods like the Extreme Studentized Deviate (ESD) test and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to classify defect regions based on their frequency characteristics [22].\nIn our study, we utilize FFT for frequency analysis and introduce dynamic thresholds tailored to each slab, enabling the precise identification of defect-prone areas within concrete slabs. This approach diverges from prior studies that focus on static frequency peak identification for general classifications by dynamically adjusting frequency ranges to accommodate slab-specific variations, thereby enhancing the detection of localized structural anomalies."}, {"title": "B. ML for IE Signals", "content": "Recent advancements in ML [13], [21] enhance the applica- tion of IE in bridge defect detection based on labeled IE data. [2] applies transfer learning to adapt laboratory-trained models for field data, addressing the scarcity of labeled field data. [20] explores explainable deep learning and transfer learning, emphasizing model interpretability in NDE applications.\nAdditionally, clustering techniques, as key unsupervised ML methods, play a significant role in defect classification for NDE applications. For instance, [1] uses unsupervised clustering to classify IE signals from real bridge deck data (the FHWA InfoBridge dataset) into categories (Good, Fair, and Poor), validating a physics-based scheme with frequency partitioning. [19] proposes a clustering algorithm for ultrasonic NDE, enhancing defect detection by separating real defects from noise. Similarly, [23] combines K-means clustering with the Level Set Method for low-contrast segmentation, offering valuable insights for improving noisy data classification. While prior studies have successfully leveraged frequency analysis, clustering techniques, and ML for defect detection, our work introduces a novel combination of dynamic frequency thresh- olding and unsupervised clustering tailored to each slab's unique frequency characteristics. This approach improves de- tection accuracy and avoids reliance on large labeled datasets, distinguishing it from both traditional and ML-based methods.\nBuilding on this foundation, we leverage FFT-based fre- quency analysis and clustering techniques to identify defect- prone areas within concrete slabs. In contrast to prior studies emphasizing static frequency thresholds or generalized peak identification for defect classification, our method introduces dynamic frequency range adjustments tailored to the specific characteristics of each slab.

This report provides an extensive dataset collected using NDE methods to detect structural anomalies in concrete bridge decks without overlays. We focus on IE data, which effectively identifies subsurface defects by detecting changes in material density and structural integrity. The dataset consists of 252 individual IE readings per slab, recorded across a 9x28 spatial grid. These readings serve as the foundation for further frequency-based analysis, including the identification of peak frequencies for defect detection."}, {"title": "B. Data Processing", "content": "1) Data Normalization: The amplitude values in each sig- nal are normalized to a standard scale. This normalization adjusts the amplitude values of each signal to lie between 0 and 1, using the formula:\n\\(A_{normalized} = \\frac{A(t) - min(A)}{max(A) - min(A)}\\)\nwhere A(t) represents amplitude, a time-domain signal.\nThis normalization reduces the influence of any external factors that could cause variations in amplitude during data collection, enabling a focus on the frequency characteristics of each signal for defect detection.\n2) Frequency Transformation: Once normalized, each am- plitude signal is analyzed in the frequency domain by applying the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [9]. FFT converts the time-domain signal into its frequency components, making it possible to detect dominant frequencies that correlate with specific defect types [10]. For each amplitude signal A(t), FFT provides the frequency components:\n\\(F(f) = FFT(A(t))\\)\nSince the FFT output is symmetric, negative frequencies are redundant and only positive frequencies are retained, as they contain the relevant information for defect detection.\nThe frequency with the highest spectral amplitude within the identified frequency range is used as the dominant frequency for each grid point, which is then classified into defect-prone or intact regions."}, {"title": "C. Adaptive Frequency Thresholding", "content": "The Adaptive Frequency Thresholding method analyzes histogram distributions to automatically identify clustered fre- quency ranges, determining defect-prone areas from intact regions by evaluating the distribution of dominant frequen- cies across all measurement points on a slab.

In this study, the bin size k is calculated as the mean of the Exponential Rule and Adjusted Square Root Rule [24], ensuring adaptability and statistical robustness.\na) Exponential Rule: The Exponential Rule defines the number of bins k as:\n\\(k = [n^{1/exponent}]\\),\nwhere n is the total number of data points, and the exponent is typically set to 1.5.\nb) Adjusted Square Root Rule: This method modifies the classic square root rule:\n\\(k = [multiplier \\sqrt{n}]\\),\nwhere the multiplier (e.g., 1.5) adjusts the bin size based on dataset variability.\nc) Combined Approach: The bin size k is calculated as:\nk = mean(Exponential Rule, Adjusted Square Root Rule)."}, {"title": "d) Histogram Construction: Using k bins, the histogram density H(b) for bin b is:", "content": "\\(H(b) = \\frac{Number\\ of\\ f_i\\ in\\ bin\\ b}{N \\cdot \\Delta f}\\)\nwhere \\(f_i\\) represents the dominant frequency, N is the total data points, and \\(\\Delta f\\) is the bin width:\n\\(\\Delta f = \\frac{Range\\ of\\ frequencies}{k}\\)\nThis combined method ensures effective frequency distribu- tion representation while maintaining statistical consistency.\n2) Frequency Range Identification: Frequency ranges are identified by grouping adjacent bins in the histogram where H(b) > 0. Starting from the first bin with H(b) > 0, the range is expanded until a bin with H(b) = 0 is encountered, marking the end of the region. The frequency range [fstart, fend] is given by:\n[fstart, fend] = [fmin + (bs \u00b7 \u2206f), fmin + ((be + 1) \u00b7 \u2206f)],\nwhere bs and be are the indices of the first and last bins with H(b) > 0, and \\(\\Delta f = \\frac{f_{max}-f_{min}}{k}\\) is the bin width.\n3) Frequency Range Classification: The identified fre- quency ranges are categorized into low-frequency ranges (in- dicative of defects) and high-frequency ranges (indicative of intact areas). Low-frequency range is the minimum range [flow-start, flow-end] chosen to represent defect-prone areas. High- frequency range is the maximum range [fhigh-start, fhigh-end] chosen to represent intact areas.\nFFT outputs are filtered to analyze only frequencies within the identified ranges.

Position Mapping", "content": "Position mapping is the process of associating frequency data with specific spatial locations on a concrete slab. The dataset consists of measurements taken across a 9x28 grid, which represents the spatial layout of the slab. Each grid cell corresponds to a particular measurement point on the slab's surface, ensuring that every frequency reading is tied to a specific spatial position.\nEach measurement point's dominant frequency is mapped to its respective grid location. The frequencies are classified as either low (defect-prone) or high (intact) based on the results of adaptive frequency thresholding. This classification ensures that each grid cell contains either a low or high peak frequency, indicating whether the area is defect-prone or intact.\nThis mapping allows for a detailed spatial representation of the slab, where defects can be visually identified based on their frequency characteristics. By associating frequency data with specific grid positions, the mapping process provides an effective means of visualizing the distribution of defects across the slab's surface, aiding in the detection and analysis of structural anomalies."}, {"title": "E. Defect Identification", "content": "1) Defect Identification through Contour Mapping: Con- tour maps are generated from the low-frequency range to analyze and visualize frequency characteristics and defect regions in concrete slabs. It provides a spatial representation of frequency characteristics across the slab surface. Areas with anomalies typically show as deviations from the expected frequency range and are highlighted using color.\nBinary contour mapping processes the classification of each grid point as either defect (1) or non-defect (0) based on dominant frequency ranges identified through adaptive thresh- olding. Several techniques can be employed to automatically determine the binary threshold. For instance, in this pilot study, binary classification is performed by setting the threshold based on the median of low frequencies for each slab. A grid point is classified as a defect (1) if its frequency is below the threshold, and as non-defect (0) otherwise. Let fthreshold be the threshold frequency. The binary classification B(x, y) at position (x, y) is given by:\n\\(B(x, y) = \\begin{cases} 1, & f(x, y) < f_{threshold} \\\\ 0, & f(x, y) \\geq f_{threshold} \\end{cases}\\)\nThese values are mapped onto the spatial grid, highlighting defect and non-defect regions.\n2) Defect Identification through Clustering: Cluster maps are generated using K-means clustering to group grid points into defect and non-defect clusters based on dominant fre- quencies in low-frequency range, as determined by adaptive thresholding. The clusters are formed by minimizing the within-cluster variance:\n\\(Cost = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\sum_{x_i \\in C_k} ||x_i - \\mu_k||^2\\)\nwhere K is the number of clusters (e.g., K = 2 for defect vs. non-defect), Ck represents the cluster k, \\(\\mu_k\\) represents the mean of cluster k, and \\(x_i\\) represents a data point (frequency) in cluster k.\nThe cluster centroids represent the mean frequency value for each cluster. By comparing these centroids, the defect cluster is identified by the lowest centroid frequency, which typically corresponds to the low-frequency region indicating defects, while the higher centroid corresponds to the intact region."}, {"title": "F.

Edge cases, such as slabs with no defect pixels in the GTM, are handled to prevent division by zero and ensure accurate metrics.\nThe following metrics [14], [18] are employed for evalu- ation, specifically tailored to assess defect detection in this study:\na) Intersection over Union (IoU): IoU measures the overlap between the DM and the GTM. It is calculated as:\n\\(IoU = \\frac{\\sum(GTM \\cap DM)}{\\sum(GTM \\cup DM)}\\)\nHere, \\(\\cap\\) denotes the intersection, and \\(\\cup\\) denotes the union of the masks.\nb) Precision: Precision quantifies the proportion of cor- rectly identified defect pixels out of all detected defect pixels:\n\\(Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\\)\nc) Recall: Recall evaluates the proportion of correctly identified defect pixels out of all ground truth defect pixels:\n\\(Recall = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\\)\nd) F1 Score: The F1 score provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\\(F1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{Precision \\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}\\)\ne) False Negative Rate (FNR): The FNR represents the proportion of actual defect pixels that the model fails to detect i.e., the proportion of defect pixels in the GTM that are missing from DM:\n\\(FNR = \\frac{FN}{FN + TP}\\)\nf) False Positive Rate (FPR): The FPR represents the proportion of non-defect pixels incorrectly classified as defects i.e., the proportion of defect pixels in the DM that are missing from GTM:\n\\(FPR = \\frac{FP}{FP + TN}\\)\ng) True Negative Rate (TNR): The TNR, also known as specificity, measures the proportion of non-defect pixels that were correctly identified as non-defects i.e., the number of non-defect pixels identified in both GTM and DM:\n\\(TNR = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\\)\nh) AUC-ROC: The AUC-ROC measures the ability of the model to distinguish between defects and non-defects across various thresholds.

Frequency Distribution and Analysis", "content": "The histograms depict the frequency distribution across all measurements for each slab, with notable peaks at certain frequency intervals. The presence of high counts at lower frequencies generally corresponds to defect regions, as defects typically alter the frequency response of the material. The presence of multiple peaks or high counts at higher frequencies may indicate areas that are defect-free. By comparing the fre- quency distribution, it can be inferred the relative severity and types of defects present in different slabs. For instance, slabs with dominant lower-frequency peaks may indicate significant defect presence, while more uniform distributions suggest a more consistent, possibly defect-free structure.

Defect Region Detection", "content": "1) Contour Mapping for Defect Identification: Figure 4 displays contour maps for eight slabs, with each plot indicating frequency distributions across the longitudinal (x-axis) and lateral (y-axis) dimensions of the slab. The color bar on the right shows the frequency in Hertz (Hz), ranging from approximately 1500 Hz to 12000 Hz. Lower frequencies are represented by warmer colors (red, orange, and yellow) and are generally indicative of potential defect-prone areas, while higher frequencies, represented by cooler colors (green and blue), suggest regions with intact material.\nIn these plots, Slabs 2, 3, and 4 stand out with significant areas of red and orange, particularly concentrated in the left and central portions, which may correspond to larger or more numerous defects. These slabs show a prominent contrast between defect-prone areas and intact regions, in- dicating higher structural variability. In contrast, Slabs 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 display fewer low-frequency zones, with the green and blue colors covering more of their surfaces. This indicates fewer defects and a more uniform material condition across these slabs. Overall, these contour maps provide a valuable visual assessment of structural integrity, highlighting areas of potential defects in each slab. These frequency-based visualizations provide a clear spatial alignment with ground truth data from the FHWA report [7], successfully identifying most defect positions. However, certain defects reported by the FHWA remain undetected, highlighting potential limitations in detection sensitivity or threshold settings.

The distribution of defects varies across slabs, with Slabs 2, 3, and 4 displaying more extensive defect regions, particularly concentrated in central and lateral sections. Conversely, Slabs 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 exhibit smaller, more isolated clusters of defects, suggesting fewer structural concerns in these slabs. This aligns with exact position of defects with ground truth.

Evaluation Results\nTable II summarizes the performance metrics for each slab using binary contour plot, while Table III presents the corresponding metrics for Cluster maps. These values are computed by overlaying the detection results onto the ground truth mask in Figure 2 for each slab, enabling pixel-by-pixel analysis. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the binary contour plots and cluster maps used in the evaluation.\nThe performance metrics for both the binary contour maps and cluster maps highlight significant differences in the detec- tion of defects across the slabs. Binary contour maps achieve high precision values (0.96 to 0.98), effectively minimizing false positives. However, the recall values, which range be- tween 0.76 and 0.79, are comparatively lower, suggesting that some defect areas present in the ground truth were not identified. This is further reflected in the relatively higher FNR, which are consistently above 0.20 for all slabs. The AUC-ROC values for the binary contour maps range from 0.78 to 0.83, reflecting a moderate ability to differentiate between defect and non-defect regions.\nIn contrast, the cluster maps show improved overall perfor- mance. The IoU values, ranging from 0.82 to 0.90, indicate better overlap with the ground truth. Precision remains high (0.93 to 0.96), while recall values (0.83 to 0.94) are notably higher than those of the binary contour maps, resulting in lower FNR values (0.05 to 0.17).

The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is consistently higher for the cluster maps, indicating their robustness.

Through indeterminacy are potential future approaches to machine learning and design.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Ambiguity, uncertainty and indeterminacy can strengthen creative work, feeding a sense of the unfamiliar and original. Yet they operate in different realms: from phenomenology to epistemology to ontology - comparable to the mapped, the navigable and the uncharted [5]. These differences have significant implications for the role machine learning might play in relation to design, data and agency.\nThis article presents works from the research of Unit 21 at the Bartlett School of Architecture [18]. It evaluates a number of original design processes developed for specific projects and contexts. Rather than creating generalised models of architectural intelligence, we interrogate the latent space as a new space that can be trained and used differently for each project."}, {"title": "Ambiguity", "content": "To create with ambiguity is to tease. It is to anticipate and defy the expectations of the audience through an obfuscation of intention, through the multiplication of meaning.\nOut of a history of classifying objects came machine vision, dreaming [26] and hallucinations. As with associated Surrealism this comes with a kind of over-determination of meaning, from an abundance of links and ties [6]. This morphing and hybrid space is an ambiguous in-between, where a priori category boundaries become overlapping. Ambiguity implicitly accepts the blackboxed model, where the blurred outputs are always the products of an input data with predetermined structure and cultural topologies [22]. Through a spatialisation of this pre-determined order, we can then map a new polyvalent territory. Typically this serves to reinforce the corpus, described by Carpo [4] as imitation, producing iterations and transfers of style and history [7] [21]."}, {"title": "Uncertainty", "content": "To create with uncertainty is to operate probabilistically.\nIn transformers [27] the next probable word, at the ideal 'temperature', offers a thermodynamic notion of creativity. Discrete atomic fragments of words or images \u2018bubble away' with differing probabilities, the sum of the vectors elevating a few favourites to escape this Brownian cloud to be the next item in the sequence. Outcomes are not ambiguous, instead each answer is less or more probable within an overall system of certainties.\nCreativity emerges from these open works through a sequential expectation. Umberto Eco stated contemporary art constantly challenges the initial order by means of an extremely \u201cimprobable\u201d form of organization [9]. Uncertainty negotiates between the degree to which a creative work maintains openness and dynamism, versus the \u201cstructural vitality\" that comes from more probable forms rather than a purely random sequence [9]. In architecture it opens new machinic possibilities for composition and authorship. When design is considered simply a syntactical process of parts and operations, these can be reconstituted and authored through nature, humans and machines.\nFor transformers, an ever growing context-length supports a more nuanced conversation [27]. Creative processes that improvise, deviate and reformulate established conventions can take advantage of this highly calibrated uncertainty. This is the dialectic between form and possibility or \"organised disorder\" [9]. Architecture can be 'read' in many ways through movement, attention and action that structure aesthetics as language and syntax. Machine learning should not simply seek to transcribe existing universal patterns and probabilities, as in language or images with GPT [27], but learn and extend the uncertainties of each circumstance as its own creative act. This is often the case within individual architectural projects where the particulars of a context, materials, community and ideas are overlaid within multimodal assemblages that create a design language unique to that circumstance.\nThe Digital Turn promised the rise of \u201cnonstandard seriality\" whereby parts no longer need to be identical [3], but for architecture unlimited variation is not enough. Endless difference in parts and authorship still needs parsing into contextual architectural outcomes that can be assembled with intelligent probabilities. Machine learning starts to suggest ways to handle and structure this variation, without simply creating variation for its own sake."}, {"title": "Indeterminacy", "content": "To create with indeterminacy is to not just suspend meaning, but test the limits of ontology. Whilst the word can be regarded as a meta-communicative frame [1] that describes how artworks or function are overall kept structurally open (as in [11]), it is also the sense in which any constituent part has limits and can be measured, derived from determinare. In complex assemblages such as architecture, individual elements are constantly in negotiation between abstraction and expression. Coded forms of representation and design manipulate the extent of indeterminacy.\nTrained models may appear as a uniformly complete instrument, but in the achievement of a statistically-learnt whole, parts are left incomplete. Machine learning is an incremental process through thousands of training cycles, applying gradual technogenesis to allow features to emerge. Just as artworks can have a margin of openness, machines can use \u201ca margin of indeterminacy\" that is critical to allow their technical growth [29]. In Variational Autoencoders [20] and GAN [10], we find input values, and implicit \u2018locations', probabilised to match idealised distributions [23]. Space is not evenly or uniformly trained, but instead achieves its variation and hybridity due to differing degrees of training and determination.\nFuture creative works should seek to control and calibrate the amount of indeterminacy within the latent space through a more direct understanding of its formation in relation to dataset structure. This may be possible with more synthetic data and semi-supervised approaches. Looking beyond an overall Loss calculation, it is in the spaces of the half-trained and half-determinate that we may find the most creative outcomes."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Margaret Boden suggests human creativity can be defined through three methods: combination, exploration and transformation [2]. It could be argued ambiguity, uncertainty and indeterminacy respectively align with these approaches. Locating these three terms with more precision might better serve creative uses of AI in future discourse, with meanings that can bridge human ambition and methods of computation.\nAmbiguity and Uncertainty locate the computational upon the world, working through combinatorial, compositional, and statistical patterns that are already established outside the black box and form the template for inference and interpretation. Machine learning as an instrument can hugely amplify and automate but does not necessarily represent a shift from established modes of working. The projects featured show how by taking a multimodal approach we can choose to combine or translate more radically and rapidly. When models are integrated within a larger creative process it can open up new notions of co-authorship, variation or context - augmenting human creativity rather than emulating it.\nIndeterminacy emerges as far more unique quality within machine learning, present within a deeper reading of how latent space forms and achieves a digital ontology from randomness. It suggests there is transductive potential in working between modalities. With further research, this may be of ultimately greater value to the creative process, moving beyond the assumption that training and data must solely emulate established environmental patterns. Datasets might be created, not just curated, in order to exploit the underlying indeterminacy of neural networks and engage with the most 'transformative' creative methods."}, {"title": "Ethical implications", "content": "The example models shown are developed, trained and aligned with very specific design contexts and outputs. They are not considered for a more generalised use with potential unforeseen impacts or biases. Training data is open source and mostly created through the direct participation of the authors through scanning, modelling, and drawing. This focus on creation through translation does not encourage the mimicry or exploitation of existing creative labour, but instead the augmentation of current creative practice."}]}

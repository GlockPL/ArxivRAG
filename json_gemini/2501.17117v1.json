While models are often adapted to user preferences, it is equally important to ensure they align with moral norms and behaviours in real-world social situations. Despite significant progress in languages like English and Chinese, French has seen little attention in this area, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs handle moral reasoning in this language. To address this gap, we introduce HISTOIRESMORALES, a French dataset derived from MORALSTORIES, created through translation and subsequently refined with the assistance of native speakers to guarantee grammatical accuracy and adaptation to the French cultural context. We also rely on annotations of the moral values within the dataset to ensure their alignment with French norms. HISTOIRESMORALES covers a wide range of social situations, including differences in tipping practices, expressions of honesty in relationships, and responsibilities toward animals. To foster future research, we also conduct preliminary experiments on the alignment of multilingual models on French and English data and the robustness of the alignment. We find that while LLMs are generally aligned with human moral norms by default, they can be easily influenced with user-preference optimization for both moral and immoral data.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in assessing and identifying the emergent properties of large language models (LLMs) (Wei et al. (2022)). With their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs such as Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) auto-regress by predicting subsequent tokens based on provided conditions or instructions. However, LLMs still struggle with multilingual complex instructions, often requiring additional customization or alignment steps to better meet user expectations for input requests. A significant aspect of alignment is ensuring that LLMs adhere to human moral values and principles, such as humility, honesty, helpfulness, and competitiveness, to make their interactions safer and more reliable (Abdulhai et al., 2023; Rao et al., 2023; Sorensen et al., 2024). Learning from user preferences in multilingual settings is a complex task, further challenged by the varying performance across different target languages (Wu and Dredze, 2020; Li et al., 2024). While a few papers explored this alignment in languages other than English, the study of such case is still limited to few languages due to a lack of data (Haemmerl et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2024), and, to the best of our knowledge, no such work has been conducted for French. In the line of works such as the French CrowS-pairs dataset (N\u00e9v\u00e9ol et al., 2022) for stereotypes, we contribute to resources for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in social reasoning tasks in French.\nThis paper introduces HISTOIRESMORALES, the first corpus for situated social reasoning in French, consisting of 12,000 stories that encompass moral norms, intentions, situations, actions (both deviating from norms and not), and the consequences of these actions. HISTOIRESMORALES is adapted to French from the widely used MORALSTORIES dataset (Emelin et al., 2021). We first translate the MORALSTORIES dataset and then refine the translations through multi-step manual annotations. Motivated by recent advances in cultural awareness in NLP (Hershcovich et al., 2022), we develop a translation approach that ensures grammatical fluency and culture-specific translation of named entities and activities, to build a semantic"}, {"title": "2 Related work", "content": "Human Values Alignment of LMs The emerging abilities of LLMs in language understanding have raised questions about their moral biases (Abdulhai et al., 2023) or whether they may perform well on moral reasoning tasks. Hendrycks et al. (2021) and Schramowski et al. (2022) evaluate the moral biases LLMs encode and their aptitudes to apply moral values. Likewise, Emelin et al. (2021) investigate the generative capacities of an LLM to produce descriptions of actions and consequences aligned with human shared values. Other research explores applications of LLMs trained on tasks involving morality challenges (Sun et al., 2023; Noothigattu et al., 2018). The problem of moral alignment of LLMs with human values is also investigated under the perspective of various moral schools-of-thought (Jiang et al., 2022; Takeshita et al., 2023).\nAlthough most research on alignment focuses on US-centred moral values, Haemmerl et al. (2023) show that LLMs encode different moral biases depending on the target language in German, Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and English. Similarly, Agarwal et al. (2024) explore the alignment of LLMs with different branches of normative ethics in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hindi, and Swahili. Ramezani and Xu (2023) investigate whether English-based LLMs accurately infer moral norms across cultures, finding better performance for Western cultures over non-Western ones. Finally, at the intersection of these ideas, Xu et al. (2024) study multilingual models in a multicultural setting, concluding that reliance on a few dominant languages often leads to conceptual inconsistencies on the encoding of culture and moral values. This concern highlights the need for diversity of languages and moral norms resources when studying the moral understanding of LLM. While some works aim to emphasize pluralistic values (Sorensen et al., 2024), they restrict their objective to English data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to create a dataset to assess LLM's morality in French, the 5th spoken language in the world with 321 millions of speakers.\nPrompting LLMs for Machine Translation Neural Machine Translation (MT) approaches began emerging with recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014), marking a shift from phrase-based statistical machine translation to the first sequence-to-sequence models. Recently, large generative language models have become a promising alternative to specialized neural models, particularly for high-resource language pairs such as English-French (Freitag et al., 2021). For MT problems, utilising prompt context can improve style (Sennrich et al., 2016), lexical diversity (Li et al., 2022), and adaptability in specific cases like code-switching (Khatri et al., 2023). The efficiency of LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, has been analysed in the context of prompting with explicit text (demonstrations) for MT (Brown et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2023, 2024). Efforts to improve LLM performance compare hand-crafting (Strobelt et al., 2023; Lampinen et al., 2022) and gradient-guided search (Shin et al., 2020; Vilar et al., 2023) approaches for selecting demonstrations or examples reordering (Lu et al., 2021). Recently, prompting with demonstrations has been shown to enhance the performance of LLMs, particularly in post-editing tasks (Raunak et al., 2023). We rely on these recent advances to define our translation protocol."}, {"title": "3 The HISTOIRESMORALES Dataset", "content": "We introduce HISTOIRESMORALES, a French dataset built upon a corpus of human-written moral stories in English called MORALSTORIES. This dataset was introduced by Emelin et al., 2021. HISTOIRESMORALES and MORALSTORIES consist of short narratives that describe moral and deviant behaviour in social situations centred around personal relationships, education, commerce, domestic affairs, and meals. We provide details about corpus statistics for both datasets in Appendix C. Each story begins with a context: a moral norm, a description of the social situation and its participants, and the actor's intention. Subsequently, each story is followed by two continuations: a moral action and its consequence and an action that deviates from the norm. We provide an example from the dataset in Table 1, both in English and French.\nTranslation Setup We use gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model for translations, accessed via the API in November 2023. We initiate the data translation process with a simple prompt and refine it through human feedback. Below, we describe the construction of the prompt body and the corresponding data annotation procedures."}, {"title": "3.1 Prompt Construction for Translation", "content": "We start with a simple prompt describing the task. Prompt 1 (P1): \u201cTranslate the following text from English to French.\u201d\nTo proceed, we randomly choose 20 stories from MORALSTORIES and translate them using P1. Then, we correct errors in the obtained translations with an annotator's assistance. By examining the revised versions, we note that five stories lack adaptation to the French cultural context, while the rest does not require any particular editing. These errors involve undergeneration in constructions with phrasal verbs and mistranslations of named entities, as classified by the taxonomy suggested by Guerreiro et al., 2023. We show erroneous translations obtained with P1 in Figure 1. For instance, the name 'John' remains unchanged, and 'get lost' is translated as 'partir' (leave), which fails to capture the original tone. A better translation to convey the impoliteness can be 'd\u00e9gager' (get lost).\nConsidering these errors, we adjust the prompt to emphasize the translation of named entities leading to the following prompt.\nPrompt 2 (P2): \u201cTranslate the following sentences into French and adapt them to the French cultural context. Note: Names must be converted into"}, {"title": "3.2 First Annotation Stage", "content": "The first annotation round validates the designed prompt for translations. We sample a hundred stories from MORALSTORIES and translate them with P2. We evaluate the effectiveness of the prompt based on four observed translation criteria: 1) equivalence of meaning, 2) grammatical correctness, 3) proper translation of named entities, and 4) adaptation to French cultural context. Before starting the annotation campaign, we provide participants with a detailed task description and a consent form. Afterward, each annotator receives instructions explaining the task, with an example for each evaluation criterion. We provide full instructions in Table 6 and Table 7 (see Appendix B).\nWe collect the majority votes for each translation criterion based on decisions from three annotators. The percentage of positive majority votes, exceeds 90% for each criterion, except for the translation of names, which achieves 83%. We evaluate the agreement among annotators for each criterion using Gwet's AC1 coefficient (Gwet, 2008), which is known to be more reliable and consistent in computing the degree of agreement among raters than Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960). Our results demonstrate a good agreement level that exceeds 0.65 among annotators for all the criteria, according to the agreement categorization suggested by Landis and Koch, 1977. We report criterion-wise agreement rate in Table 10 (Appendix B).\nTo highlight cases of imperfect translations, we compute the observed agreement, i.e., instances where there is no disagreement among annotators. Further, we construct the demonstrations using the cases with the lowest observed agreement and AC1 coefficient value, as described in the next section."}, {"title": "3.3 Prompt With Demonstrations", "content": "To further improve translation quality, we add examples of the task in the prompt. We adopt the demonstration template from Lampinen et al., 2022 and design demonstrations with explanations of translation errors and their corrections.\nWe select translation cases with errors identified by all annotators, as measured using the observed agreement from the first annotation stage and the ones receiving a negative majority vote. It results in 15 demonstrations. Subsequently, we format them as follows: source (S), translation (T), and explanation of errors (H). The errors and suggested improvements are collected with the assistance of one participant from the previous annotation stage. We ask the annotator to provide explanations for errors in translations limited to 100 words to comply with the maximum 16k words context length constraint of the translation model. Examples are shown in Table 11 (Appendix A).\nSince named entities translations had the lower majority vote in the first annotation stage, we update the P2 to add specific rules for this criterion. To do so, we adjust the prompt to highlight the importance of name translation."}, {"title": "3.4 Second Annotations Stage", "content": "The second annotation round validates the beneficial impact of task demonstrations. For this round of annotations, we randomly sample another set of hundred stories from the English dataset (outside from the ones we already worked with) and translate them with and without demonstrations. We ask three annotators to select the best translation among the two (Q1) and mark the similarity between them (Q2). The interface for the task is presented in Table 9 (Appendix B). The translations are shuffled before the annotation phase to exclude bias in selecting only right or left answers. We collect majority votes for the answers to both questions. The results show that in 80% of the cases, annotators prefer the translations obtained using the prompt with demonstrations (Q1); as for the other question, in 60% of the cases, they also consider the translations to be equivalent (Q2). We plot detailed results in Figure 5 (Appendix B). When looking into the details, we observe that in half of the cases, annotators select translations with demonstrations and mark them as dissimilar to the other translations. On the other hand, when the translations are close, annotators still prefer the one generated with the prompt with demonstrations. Based on these results, we validate the prompt and use it to translate the remaining 11,900 stories from the dataset. On average, response latency per translation with P3 is about 3 seconds. We provide an example from the obtained dataset in Table 1 and more examples in Table 5 (Appendix A)."}, {"title": "4 Dataset Evaluation", "content": "This section analyses the quality of the obtained HISTOIRESMORALES dataset."}, {"title": "4.1 Translation Evaluation", "content": "This section analyses the quality of the obtained HISTOIRESMORALES dataset.\nGrammatical Acceptability We use a rule-based grammar checker, LanguageTool, that supports French to verify the grammatical correctness of our dataset.

We manually review the detected mistakes and update the translations of the erroneous stories.\nTranslation Quality We measure the quality of translation with the COMETKIWI22 reference-free quality estimation (QE) metric introduced by Rei et al., 2022. This metric is suitable for sentence and word-level QE and supports English-to-French translations, with values between 0 and 1, and higher values indicating better translations."}, {"title": "4.2 Cultural Value Alignment", "content": "Next, we assess the agreement of native French speakers with the cultural values described in the obtained dataset. While our initial intention is not to adapt the morality of the dataset, we ensure the alignment of norms and actions with the perceptions of French annotators. We ask 4 French annotators to label 500 norms, immoral and moral actions to indicate whether the norm is adapted to the French background and whether the actions are also considered moral or immoral from French perspectives. We consider an entry to be adapted (Agreement) if fewer than two annotators disagree, not adapted if more than 2 disagree (Disagreement), and label it as Uncertainty if exactly 2 disagree. We present the results in Figure 3 and note that the norms are almost completely aligned (in 98%), more importantly the disagreement for the moral and immoral actions is only in 1% and 4.2% of the cases, respectively. The Uncertainty bar for immoral actions (7.2%) highlights that certain moral situations are nuanced, as individual moral judgements often depend on personal experiences."}, {"title": "5 Model Moral Alignment", "content": "In this section, we show that the dataset can be used to investigate the alignment of LLMs with human values across languages. We demonstrate how our dataset, combined with the one from (Emelin et al., 2021), can serve to investigate 1) the alignment of LLMs with human moral norms and 2) the impact of language (English and French) on it."}, {"title": "5.1 Likelihood evaluation", "content": "Methodology Inspired by recent works on fairness (Nangia et al., 2020; Manerba et al., 2023), we use the perplexity metric derived from the log-likelihood loss (Jelinek et al., 1977) to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with moral norms. Perplexity (PPL) quantifies the model's uncertainty in predicting a sequence. Specifically, we compute the perplexity of the model on two pairs of sentences constructed as follows: Norm + Context + Intention + Action, where Action \u2208 {moral, immoral}. Let PPLM and PPL1, be respectively the perplexity of the sentence with moral and immoral action. We compare PPLM and PPL1 to deduce the more probable action. Then, we count the instances where PPLM is higher than PPL1. We also integrate our datasets into the lm-eval-harness framework (Gao et al., 2023) to ensure compatibility with other benchmarks and present corresponding results in \u00a7E.2.\nEvaluation Settings We use Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) and Croissant (Faysse et al., 2024) Instruc versions in our study. These models are suitable for our experiments due to their competitive performance on FrenchBench and English common-sense reasoning benchmarks, as evaluated by Faysse et al., 2024. Additionally, their sizes (7B and 1.3B parameters, respectively) make them tractable for practitioners. Finally, we focus on moral actions, leaving the exploration of consequences for further studies.\nResults We report results for the evaluation the alignment of models with moral norms in Table 3. Considering the perplexity, lower scores indicate a higher probability of a sentence. PPL scores, on average, are close for moral and immoral actions, with comparable standard deviations. This consistency can stem from the fluency of sentences, making them both highly probable. Similarly, the preference for moral actions is generally balanced with the preference for immoral actions, except for Croissant on English texts, where the model seems to align more with immoral ones. We consider those results further when aiming to influence the model's moral leanings (\u00a76). While we present here the results for the instruct models, additional ones for the base versions of these models are reported in \u00a7E.2 with comparable observations as well as more findings where we assess the impact of the sentence lengths."}, {"title": "5.2 Action selection with declarative prompt", "content": "Methodology To evaluate the moral alignment, we also prompt the model in a declarative manner to choose an action between two choices based on a scenario. The latter consists of either the Norm, Context and Intention (w\\ norm) or the Context and Intention only (w\\o norm). This experiment enables us to investigate the model's moral alignment within a widely used application of LLMs: generating responses given specific prompts.\nEvaluation Settings We conduct this experiment with Mistral model. We report a detailed list of hyperparameters and the prompts in both languages in Appendix D. Note that we ensure that the order of proposed actions does not impact the decision. We also attempt to implement this experiment on Croissant unsuccessfully. We test several variations of the prompt, but the model is unable to choose an action and instead generates continuation. For comparison, we investigate the performance of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) on this task. We exclude stories for which the LLaMA model refuses to respond and report results on non-blocked responses for both models to ensure fair comparison.\nResults We provide the results of prompting Mistral and LLaMA to choose an action based on a situation in Table 4. While the models select the moral actions in most cases, two important points should be noted.\nFirstly, both LLMs perform better when prompted with the norm, especially in English. Indeed, including the moral norm constraints in the prompt improves the number of times the moral choice is preferred in French by 0.69% and by 2.15% in English for Mistral. For LLaMA, the preference improves by 1.59% in French and by 1.22% in English. Secondly, Mistral is more aligned with human morality when prompted with actions in English rather than in French; in 10% of the cases, the model prefers the moral choice in English while picking the immoral one in French. However, for LLaMA, this difference is less than 1%.\nTo understand this gap between the languages in action selection with Mistral, we start by manually checking the actions where there is a disagreement. We observe that in several examples, there is ambiguity in the actions with regard to the norm. We present several examples in Table 15 (\u00a7E.1). To validate this hypothesis, we train a T5 model (Raffel et al., 2020) to classify whether a sentence containing an action is labelled moral or immoral. On evaluation data where Mistral predictions is consistent across languages the model reaches 83% of accuracy against 72.6% on the set containing the 10% cases where Mistral pick different choices in French and English. Details of the experiments are given in \u00a7E.1. We also explore whether ambiguities arise in specific topics (e.g., relationships, education, commerce) using Latent Dirichlet Allocation but find no significant patterns. Additionally, we observe no notable trends in action selection correlations with the length of tokenized actions. Since only a small proportion of annotators disagrees with cultural alignment of moral norms (Figure 3), we hypothesize that the discrepancies in predictions are primarily due to the imbalance in the English-French pre-training data used for Mistral, rather than stemming from actual cultural differences.\nWhen analysing the stories where the LLaMA model refuses to respond, we observe significant variation across seeds, with only 1% overlap between them. Furthermore, the average number of blocked stories in French is more than twice that in English\u2014115 compared to 29 when prompted with the norm, and 225 compared to 100 without the norm.\nWe select a few stories and observe that, when prompted with the norm, LLaMA tends to block stories involving immoral actions on sensitive top-"}, {"title": "6 Influencing LLM with Direct Preference Optimization", "content": "In this section, we probe whether the models' alignment is robust to external influence, an important task to ensure that decision-support models do not produce immoral content.\nMethodology Using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), we aim to influence the model to prefer either moral (DPOM) or immoral (DPO\u2081) actions. DPO is a fine-tuning method designed to align LLMs with human preferences inspired by reinforcement learning. It is based on two models, a reference model and the main model, that is fine-tuned with an objective to increase the likelihood of preferred responses while decreasing that of dispreferred responses. Thus, DPO also relies on pairs of entries, the preference data, where one entry is considered preferable to the other. We replace those pairs with moral and immoral actions to evaluate whether the model can be influenced to prefer ones over the others. Furthermore, we investigate the number of examples required to shift the model toward a specific leaning, which serves as a measure of the model's robustness to moral influence.\nEvaluation Settings We conduct the experiments on the Mistral base model using QLORA (Dettmers et al., 2023) for the DPO training; all the hyperparameters are described in Appendix D. We consider a test set of 3, 500 examples (30% of the whole set), with the remaining data forming the training set. To evaluate the impact of the training set size, we sequentially train the model with 8 (0.1% of the training set), 84 (1%), 840 (10%) and 8400 (100%) examples. Finally, we compute the PPL on the test set to measure the change of leaning of the model.\nResults In Figure 4c, we report the percentage of times the moral action is preferred, based on the PPL, when the model is trained using DPO to favour either moral or immoral actions. The baselines correspond to evaluations without DPO. Note that we ensure models after DPO are not imputed of other reasoning abilities on the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020). We provide details and results in \u00a7E.3. We vary the number of examples seen during the training and note several points. Firstly, the model can be trained in both ways to align or diverge from human moral norms present in the datasets. Secondly, only 84 examples are sufficient to observe the impact of DPO, while 840 examples allow the model to prefer moral or immoral actions almost all the time. Lastly, we note that Mistral is slightly less robust in English than in French regarding moral influence.\nIn Figure 4a, we plot PPL across considered training sizes. We apply DPOM and DPO\u2081 on French data. We observe that the PPL of moral actions (PPLM) when we apply DPOM is lower than that for immoral actions (PPL 1) and reversely when we apply DPO1. With more examples presented to the model, the PPLs of the two possible actions diverge further denoting the change of alignment. We observe similar tendencies for English data (Figure 7a, \u00a7E.3).\nIn Figure 4b, we plot the difference of PPL compared to the no-DPO baseline for DPOM. We report extended results for DPO in \u00a7E.3. From those observations, Mistral demonstrates greater robustness in French compared to English: the gap between PPLM and PPL1 is larger for English data than for French. Therefore, the confidence of the model for one or another alignment type is stronger in English than in French. Compared to the results without DPO, the perplexity of the sentences with actions opposite to the direction of DPO significantly increases when the number of training examples is higher, emphasizing the model's preference for a specific direction. These elements converge to indicate that the model is not robust, and its alignment can be easily influenced. This poses a risk if directed towards immoral choices.\nOverall, our results demonstrate that LLM are likely to align to immoral and moral behaviours with equal probability, despite being sensitive to alignment shifts. Interestingly, the training dynam-"}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "This work introduces HISTOIRESMORALES, the first dataset for social reasoning informed by behavioural guidelines in the French language.

We also conduct an analysis of dataset quality, including the cultural value alignment of social norms and actions with the moral principles shared in France. Our dataset encourages practitioners to explore potential applications of bilingual data for grounded social reasoning. We perform initial investigations into potential applications and demonstrate how datasets can be used to compare the alignment of moral values in LLMs across two languages. Our experiment results indicate a substantial difference in action choices among existing LLMs between English and French. We demonstrate how our dataset can be leveraged to adapt to user preferences using DPO, requiring less than 100 examples.\nFuture work may explore the models' capacity for generating action consequences based on input actions.

While the source corpus was collected from participants in different countries, it cannot be considered universally representative of all individuals' moral norms and the actions that align with or oppose them, which is one limitation of the corpus. Moreover, both datasets present dichotomous actions and consequences, although there can be multiple actions aligned with or contrary to a given norm. Next, while we address the culture-specific translation of named entities, determining the best translation equivalent for names can vary, which can be seen as a limitation of the translation pipeline. Next, when evaluating cultural value alignment, we collect annotations from native French speakers based in France, which can be seen as a limitation considering the diversity of the Francophone community worldwide. Moreover, despite showing a general agreement from annotators with the norms contained in the dataset, we acknowledge that there exists strong divergence between norms present in the United States and ones in France that are not present in the dataset (e.g. carrying weapons).\nFinally, an extensive evaluation of moral biases encoded by LLMs is not the focus of this paper.

Then, we evaluate the model on unseen data from the batch where the prompted models agree (validation) and on the 10% where the models disagree (test). On the validation set, the model reaches 83% of accuracy against 72.6% on the test set.

We conduct these experiments on French and English datasets, using Mistral and Croissant models. Table 17 shows the percentage of moral action selected using unnormalized and byte-level normalized likelihood scores. Similar to perplexity results, both moral and immoral continuations are chosen approximately equally, with moral actions selected about only half the time.

In particular, we evaluate models on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) zero-shot benchmarks and compare the results obtained with the Mistral baseline. We find that there is no negative impact of training with DPO on model performance in language understanding tasks."}, {"title": "E.3 Influencing LLM with DPO", "content": "In this section, we report complementary results for DPO.

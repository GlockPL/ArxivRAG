{"title": "FEDMEKI: A Benchmark for Scaling Medical Foundation Models via Federated Knowledge Injection", "authors": ["Jiaqi Wang", "Xiaochen Wang", "Lingjuan Lyu", "Jinghui Chen", "Fenglong Ma"], "abstract": "This study introduces the Federated Medical Knowledge Injection (FEDMEKI) platform, a new benchmark designed to address the unique challenges of integrating medical knowledge into foundation models under privacy constraints. By leveraging a cross-silo federated learning approach, FEDMEKI circumvents the issues associated with centralized data collection, which is often prohibited under health regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA. The platform is meticulously designed to handle multi-site, multi-modal, and multi-task medical data, which includes 7 medical modalities, including images, signals, texts, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables. The curated dataset to validate FEDMEKI covers 8 medical tasks, including 6 classification tasks (lung opacity detection, COVID-19 detection, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormal detection, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction, and enlarged cardiomediastinum detection) and 2 generation tasks (medical visual question answering (MedVQA) and ECG noise clarification). This comprehensive dataset is partitioned across several clients to facilitate the decentralized training process under 16 benchmark approaches. FEDMEKI not only preserves data privacy but also enhances the capability of medical foundation models by allowing them to learn from a broader spectrum of medical knowledge without direct data exposure, thereby setting a new benchmark in the application of foundation models within the healthcare sector.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Foundation models have revolutionized various domains by demonstrating powerful capabilities in handling different modalities and tasks. Models such as GPT-3 [1] and LLaMA [2] have shown exceptional performance across a wide range of applications. The primary reason for their success is their exposure to vast amounts of training data, enabling them to acquire a deep understanding of diverse domains. Leveraging this extensive data allows foundation models to generalize effectively and perform well across various tasks, making them invaluable in many fields.\nIn the medical domain, there have been attempts to develop medical foundation models that replicate the success seen in general domains [3-5]. However, the limited availability of public medical data restricts the ability to train medical foundation models from scratch. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed fine-tuning general foundation models with medical data to customize medical foundation models. For instance, PMC-LLaMA [6] fine-tunes LLaMA with 4.8 million biomedical academic papers and 30,000 medical books. Similarly, LLaVA-Med [7] fine-tunes LLaVA [8] with biomedical image-text pairs extracted from PMC-15M [9]. Although existing"}, {"title": "A New Task.", "content": "To achieve this goal, we introduce a new task to scale existing medical foundation models, named Federated Medical Knowledge Injection into foundation models (FEDMEKI). In this task, each client stores a set of private multi-modal, multi-task medical datasets, while the server hosts a medical foundation model. The objective is to inject client medical knowledge into the foundation model without sharing their private data. This new task presents several unique challenges compared to existing medical foundation model fine-tuning methods."}, {"title": "C1 \u2013 Data Fine-tuning vs. Parameter Adaptation.", "content": "This new task prohibits the sharing of private data among clients. To extract medical knowledge from these clients, a straightforward solution is to treat the learned client model parameters as a new format of medical knowledge, which will be uploaded to the server for knowledge injection. However, the foundation model deployed on the server has different network structures from the client models, making it impossible to perform averaging operations like FedAvg [10]. The challenge here is to adapt client model parameters to the foundation model."}, {"title": "C2 - Task-specific Fine-tuning vs. Scalable Fine-tuning.", "content": "Existing medical foundation models can only handle task-specific downstream tasks. For instance, LLaVA-Med is fine-tuned for medical vision question answering (VQA) tasks, including VQA-RAD [11], SLAKE [12], and PathVQA [13]. Similarly, PMC-LLaMA can only handle tasks that use text inputs, including PubMedQA [14], MedMCQA [15], and USMLE [16]. In addition to medical images and text, complex medical data include other commonly used modalities, such as medical signals and lab results, which existing medical foundation models often miss. Therefore, this new task is crucial for enabling the simultaneous fine-tuning of medical foundation models with diverse modalities."}, {"title": "A Comprehensive Medical Dataset.", "content": "To address the aforementioned challenges and benchmark this new task, we first curated a new multi-site, multi-modal, multi-task dataset. This dataset covers eight diverse medical tasks: lung opacity detection [17], COVID-19 detection [18], ECG abnormal detection [19], mortality prediction [20], sepsis prediction [20], enlarged cardiomediastinum detection [21], MedVQA [11], and signal noise clarification [22]. These tasks span seven medical modalities: medical images, medical texts, medical signals, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables, extracted from seven publicly available datasets (RSNA [17], COVQU [18], PTB-XL [19], MIMIC-III [23], CheXpert [21], VQA-RAD [11], and ECG-QA [22]). We divided the tasks in our dataset into training tasks and validation tasks. The training tasks aim to inject modality-level knowledge into medical foundation models, while the validation tasks evaluate the ability of zero-shot inference for the knowledge-injected medical foundation models. The data is distributed to several clients, following a cross-silo federated learning setting similar to FLamby [24], due to the typically small size of medical datasets."}, {"title": "A Novel Federated Knowledge Injection Platform.", "content": "We have developed a new FEDMEKI platform to address this new task with the curated dataset, as shown in Figure 1.

Besides, it implements 16 methods as benchmarks to evaluate the platform, including traditional federated learning, federated learning with fine-tuning, and federated learning with foundation model scaling. To sum up, the contributions of this work are fourfold:\n\u2022 We investigate an important and practical task in the medical domain, aiming to inject medical knowledge into medical foundation models in a cross-silo federated manner, thereby scaling the capability of medical foundation models while ensuring privacy."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Federated Learning with Medical Data. Medical data containing highly sensitive patient in-formation is rigorously protected by various regulations and laws, making centralized access and processing impractical for machine learning model training. Federated learning [10], a distributed paradigm, enables participants to train machine learning models without exchanging data. This approach has been extensively applied in medical tasks using different types of medical data, such as electronic health records (EHRs) [25\u201328] and medical imaging [29-31]. There are a range of applications of federated learning in healthcare, encompassing disease prediction [32\u201334], medical image classification [35\u201337], and segmentation [38, 39]. Additionally, several surveys have reviewed related advancements [40\u201343]. To date, only one benchmark [24] has investigated the application of federated learning specifically to medical data. Notably, no research has yet explored the scalability of medical foundation models within a federated framework.\nMedical Foundation Models. Foundation models, characterized by their extensive parameters and vast training datasets, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains [2, 44-47]. In the realm of healthcare, these models are increasingly prevalent. Thirunavukarasu et al. (2023) [48] discuss the potential of large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings, highlighting their effective-ness in healthcare applications. Moor et al. (2023) [3] introduce the concept of a generalist medical AI, designed to handle diverse tasks using multimodal medical data. Additionally, specialized medical foundation models have been developed for targeted applications such as disease detection using retinal images [5], cancer imaging biomarker identification [49], echocardiogram interpretation [50], medical image segmentation [51], and precision oncology [52]. Despite these advancements, there re-mains a gap in research concerning the development of datasets and benchmarks that enable medical foundation models to integrate and leverage medical knowledge from distributed data sources.\nFederated Fine-tuning with Foundation Models. To achieve better performance in specific tasks, fine-tuning foundation models (FMs) with task-specific data is essential. FL facilitates this fine-tuning process by allowing the use of locally stored data through distributed computational resources. Existing related research can be categorized into full tuning [53, 54], partial tuning [55-57], and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) [58,59]. In [58], each client has a foundation model and"}, {"title": "3 The FEDMEKI Platform", "content": "As shown in Figure 1(a), the designed FEDMEKI platform consists of several clients {C1,\u2026\u2026, Cn} and a server S.

The trained client models {W1,\u2026\u2026,WN} will be uploaded to the server. After receiving the client models, the server will inject the aggregated medical knowledge representation by W, into the medical foundation model F using the public data Dp. The updated global model W will be distributed to each client again for the learning of the next communication round until convergence."}, {"title": "3.1 Client Deployment", "content": "The goal of FEDMEKI is to inject medical knowledge learned from private multi-modal multi-task data Dn into the foundation model F. We deploy a basic client model Wn to handle the multi-modal multi-task data to achieve this goal.\nModality-specific Encoders. Although we have five training tasks for each client, some tasks share the same modality. For example, both ECG abnormal detection [19] and ECGQA [22] tasks have the signal ECG modality. To avoid the redundancy of modality encoders and learn shared features across tasks, we propose to deploy modality-specific encoders. The details of these encoders are shown in Appendix Section N. Let (x, y) \u2208 Dn denote a training sample. Only the task-associated encoders will generate outputs, and the output of an encoder is denoted as ENCm (xn) (m\u2208 [1, M]), where M is the number of unique modalities. We finally obtain the task-specific representation of each data sample r by concatenating outputs from task-associated encoders.\nTask-specific Decoders. Each task has a unique decoder DECT (rm) to generate the outcome and we use cross-entropy as the loss. The details of each task-specific decoder are shown in Appendix of Section N.\nFederated Optimization. The ground truth yn will be used to optimize the client model Wn with the cross-entropy loss for all training tasks. Since there are several ways to conduct federated learning, we use FedAvg [10] and FedProx [60] as examples to demonstrate how FEDMEKI works in this study.\n\u2022 FedAvg [10] aims to collaboratively train each client separately and upload their model parameters {W1,\u2026, WN}.\n\u2022 FedProx [60] is developed based on FedAvg but added an L2 regularization term on each local loss function as follows\n\nmin Jn(Wn; Ws) = Ln(Wn) + \u03bb/2||Wn-Ws||\u00b2,\n\nwhere W is the global model, Ln(\u00b7) is the client loss function, and \u03bb is a hyperparameter.

Our goal is to enable F to work on tasks with other modalities.\nTo this end, we follow the LLaVA's fine-tuning style to generate the representation r of a public data sample (x, y) \u2208 D\u2081 using the encoder of W, first. We then align r with the task prompt representation tk using a linear layer, i.e., h = MLP(r), where tk = EMBF(Tk), EMBF(\u00b7) denotes the embedding layer of F, and Tk is the k-th task's prompt. The concatenation of h and tk is subsequently fed into F to generate the output \u0177. Finally, the parameters are optimized by the ground truth y.

The updated W, is then sent to all clients again for updates in the next communication round until FEDMEKI converges."}, {"title": "4 The FEDMEKI Dataset Suite", "content": "Since we propose a new research task, no existing datasets are suitable for evaluation. We curated a new dataset from publicly available medical sources to address this, comprising two types of tasks: training and validation.

The validation tasks are independent of the training tasks and are used to assess the ability of the scaled medical foundation model in zero-shot inference."}, {"title": "4.1 Training Tasks", "content": "To inject medical knowledge into the foundation model F, as shown in Section 3.1, we need to train tasks to cover as many medical modalities as possible. In this benchmark, we choose 4 commonly used classification tasks covering 6 medical modalities. Note that we do not use any tasks with the text modality since the medical foundation model F has the superior capability to handle texts.\n(1) Lung Opacity Detection [17] is an unimodal classification task aiming at predicting lung opacity from chest X-ray images. The data are provided by the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge 2018 [17]. Medical practitioners at the Society for Thoracic Radiology and MD.ai provide the annotations, i.e., ground truth labels. The original medical images are found in the chest X-ray database [71].\n(2) COVID-19 Detection requires the model to determine whether an X-ray image indicates COVID-19 symptoms, testing the model's understanding of medical images. We utilize the COVQU dataset [18] for this task.\n(3) ECG Abnormal Detection aims to determine whether an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal exhibits abnormal patterns or not. This is an unimodal binary classification task, where the data are sourced from an existing ECG database [19], consisting of 12-lead ECGs of 10-second length.\n(4) Mortality Prediction involves using various data points and a classification or predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a patient's survival or death during their stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We extract the data from MIMIC-III using the ICU-oriented preprocessing pipeline [72]. Following [20], we extract 48 dynamic features, including vital signs (7 variables) and laboratory tests (39 variables), with two more variables that measure input (fraction of inspired oxygen) and output (urine)."}, {"title": "4.2 Validation Tasks", "content": "Using the training tasks, we can inject various medical knowledge into the foundation model F by inserting an aggregated encoder learned from federated clients into F.

Single-task evaluation aims to validate the general-ization ability of FEDMEKI on tasks with specific modalities. We use the following approaches as benchmark baselines: (1) Traditional Federated Learning (TFL). We use two representative federated learning models as benchmark baselines: FedAvg [10] and FedProx [60]. For each task, we use the corresponding task data to train an FL model FedAvg, or FedProx. We use the aggregated global model to evaluate the performance. (2) Federated Learning with Global Fine-tuning (FL+GF). Since the server stores a small set of public data Dtra, the traditional models can conduct the fine-tuning using Dtra for the aggregated global models. These approaches are denoted as FedAvgs and Fed-Prox. (3) Federated Learning with LLM Fine-tuning (FL+LLM). To further enhance the learning ability of traditional federated learning approaches, we allow them to fine-tune with the LLM. In particular, the encoder of each aggregated model will be used first to generate the representation of the public data.

A primary goal of training foundation models is to boost the perfor-mance of multiple downstream tasks, especially for zero-shot inference. To achieve this goal, we test the scaled medical foundation models in the previous experiment with four tasks.

Also, the sepsis prediction task is similar to the mortality prediction task in training, sharing the same feature space. However, the MedVQA and signal noise clarification tasks are new since they combine two modalities, which were not trained during the training. Thus, the two generation tasks are much harder than the two classification ones.\nFrom the results shown in Table 4, we can observe that the knowledge-injected medical foundation models have the ability to deal with new tasks. Although the performance of the two generation-based tasks still has signif-icant room for improvement, the de-signed platform at least can work for such tasks compared to the original medical foundation model MMedLM-2.

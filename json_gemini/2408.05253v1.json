{"title": "A Systematic Literature Map on Big Data", "authors": ["Rog\u00e9rio Rossi", "Kechi Hirama", "Eduardo Ferreira Franco"], "abstract": "The paradigm of Big Data has been established as a solid field of studies in many areas such as healthcare, science, transport, education, government services, among others. Despite widely discussed, there is no agreed definition about the paradigm although there are many concepts proposed by the academy and industry. This work aims to provide an analytical view of the studies conducted and published regarding the Big Data paradigm. The approach used is the systematic map of the literature, combining bibliometric analysis and content analysis to depict the panorama of research works, identifying patterns, trends, and gaps. The results indicate that there is still a long way to go, both in research and in concepts, such as building and defining adequate infrastructures and standards, to meet future challenges and for the paradigm to become effective and bring the expected benefits.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Since, the mid-1980s the term Big Data has been used as a paradigm of high relevance for the academy, industry, executives from different business areas, and society in general who are involved wi.th modern components and digital information systems. As mentioned by [1], the Big Data era has reached several sectors, from government and e-commerce to healthcare organizations.\nRespected and renowned research institutions, such as McKinsey & Company [2], The Data Warehouse Institute [3], IBM Research [4], among others, presented technical reports demonstrating the high relevance of studies related to Big Data. As there are divergences among studies and technical reports on the subject, it is not possible to verify a standard definition for Big Data allowing verifying different concepts for the term.\nBesides its concepts, the properties associated with the term can be verified by many authors [4-8]. However, when its properties are considered, it is possible to identify a consensus associated with the Big Data 3V's Properties that corresponds to Volume, Variety, and Velocity.\nBig Data is now presenting some relevant challenges in the field of technology infrastructure, the people involved, and the processes and business models associated with this digital information paradigm.\nAs a paradigm of large amplitude, it reaches organizations devoted to financial, commercial, and industrial business; social areas; governments, scientific associations and other environments that benefit from the information in the digital era. It also reaches universities to provide answers regarding to Big Data questions as also to efficiently and quickly prepare new qualified human resources.\nConsequently, some bibliometric indicators presented results in technical and scientific publications related to Big Data [1,6]. In addition to the technical and scientific reports, consistent results are presented by the information industry [3], representing a continuous movement to meet the needs introduced by this new paradigm of computing.\nThere are many researches works in different scientific and social fields regarding to Big Data. The use and application of Big Data have also increased significantly according to the reports presented by IDC [9] and Gartner [10], which suggest more formal and deeper exploitation and considerations on this paradigm. Considering this scenario, the goal of this work is to provide an analytical view of the studies published on the subject in a highly relevant scientific database. To achieve this goal, this work conducted a systematic literature map, merging bibliometric and content analysis.\nTo achieve its goal, the paper is organized into five sections. Section two presents the research method adopted to collect and to analyze the sample of selected articles. Section three presents the results from the bibliometric and content analysis, followed by the discussion of the results in section four. Finally, section five presents the conclusions and limitations of this study and suggestions for future work."}, {"title": "RESERCH DESIGN", "content": "The main objective of this work is to outline the scenario of the scientific literature on the \"Big Data\" topic using the bibliometric and content analysis of the selected sample articles, describing the trends, the key themes covered, identify the main journals that represent the discussion forum of the theme; who are the major authors; if there has been an increase in the number of publications over the period analyzed; which work most influenced the research community; and the main topics studied.\nAligned with the research objective the selected methodological approach was a systematic literature map, mixing bibliometric analysis [14] and content analysis [15], which are complementary [16].\nThe methodological approach selected for this study was the bibliometric analysis, which is a technique that allows assessing the existence of patterns in the literature on a particular topic, identifying the main journals dedicated to promoting and discussing a subject, the evolution of these publications over time, and what issues most relate to the searched subject. Furthermore, the approach enables to perform the analysis of the citations, which identify the works that most impacted the area by building the paper-paper citation network, and between those selected works and the most cited references [11,12]."}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "The 288 articles selected were published in 152 journals.

It is also presented its relationship with the eleven most cited articles presented in Table III.\nThe first keyword, i.e., the most mentioned by all articles corresponds to Big Data. The considerations related to the other keywords are presented in an analytical and conceptual view according to the most cited word, i.e., Big Data.\nAs can be seen in Table V, the keyword Big Data Analytics was mentioned three times by considering the set of eleven articles, representing the most mentioned keyword. All the others were cited only once.\nWith the set of keywords identified, it is possible to verify that there is a close relationship between some of them, promoting an integrated approach to specific concepts.\nBig Data Analytics, Analytics, and Predictive Analytics are the keywords frequently cited offering prominence to define a term that has been associated with Big Data, which refers to Analytics or also to Big Data Analytics. The terms Big Data and Analytics have different definitions, sometimes interchangeable and sometimes generating conceptual conflict, as can be seen in [30], describing that some executives are questioning whether Big Data is not just another way of saying Analytics."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "This work aimed to depict the panorama of published studies regarding to Big Data evaluating its maturity by following a consistent method of scientific research. For analyzing the published scientific articles, the \"Web of Science\" (WoS) database was used along with the bibliometric analysis following a specific workflow to favor the observation of the production and expansion of scientific articles considering Big Data.\nThe bibliometric analysis allowed some detailed responses presented in two formats: the first one from the perspective of some categories presented in Table IV and the second one based on the concepts observed from the keywords with higher frequency index and presented in the eleven most cited articles as Table V.\nA detailed review and analysis of these studies allowed observing that this is a term involved in many research areas and presented in a variety of complexity levels.\nBig Data scientific studies concern areas such as economics, business, healthcare, information systems, among others. Some research works are related to new technologies, processes and models addressing the Big Data Architecture and Infrastructure as verified in [28] and [36]; as also some are linked to expectations considering Big Data responses.\nThus, since the works have varying levels of complexity, it was possible to find articles with high scientific formalism, besides works that present certain superficiality regarding results. Basic concepts observable in most studies are greatly repeated, which leads to a sense of solidification of this initial stage of research.\nThere are some surveys on Big Data, many specific works related to a particular subject or area, and others that involve technologies to support Big Data. However, a slow convergence of these studies or surveys was observed; again, it is possible to note that although linearly the research works present some advance, in its integrative way, they do not converge.\nEmbracing challenges and powerful results, the Big Data paradigm has been established in many areas, despite not presenting concrete and replicable results yet, but as a solid element of studies and research that may provide significant improvements in sectors such as healthcare, science, transport, education, government services, among others."}]}

Firstly, through Spearman correlation analysis of CPU, usage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of instructions executed, execution time and energy efficiency, we found that power consumption has the highest degree of positive correlation with energy efficiency, while CPU usage has the highest degree of negative correlation with energy efficiency. In our experiments, we introduced a random forest model and an optimisation model based on the horned lizard optimisation algorithm for testing, and the results show that the optimisation algorithm has better prediction results compared to the random forest model. Specifically, the mean square error (MSE) of the optimisation algorithm is 0.01 smaller than that of the random forest model, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.01 smaller than that of the random forest.3 The results of the combined metrics show that the optimisation algorithm performs more accurately and reliably in predicting energy efficiency.

However, as the scale of cloud computing continues to expand and the number of data centres increases, energy consumption becomes an increasingly serious problem [1]. Energy consumption in data centres not only negatively affects the environment, but also increases operational costs, so how to improve energy efficiency in cloud computing environments has become one of the hotspots in current research.\nWhen studying energy efficiency in cloud computing, we usually focus on parameters such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of executed instructions and execution time [2]. There are complex correlations and influences between these parameters, and traditional optimisation methods often find it difficult to comprehensively consider the interactions between these factors. In contrast, machine learning, as a powerful data analysis tool, can help optimise energy efficiency in cloud environments by learning and modelling massive data and discovering hidden patterns and trends [3].\nMachine learning algorithms play an important role in energy efficiency research. Firstly, by analysing and mining historical data, predictive models can be built to forecast future system resource utilisation, which in turn can adjust the system configuration to improve energy utilisation [4]. Second, machine learning can also optimise resource allocation through intelligent scheduling algorithms to reduce power consumption while ensuring system performance. In addition, machine learning can also monitor the system operation status in real time through the intelligent decision-making system and adjust the system parameters according to the real-time data to achieve the best energy efficiency.\nIn summary, the study of energy efficiency in cloud computing is one of the urgent problems that need to be solved nowadays. Machine learning algorithms, as a powerful tool, play an increasingly important role in this field, and are expected to help us better optimise resource utilisation in cloud environments, reduce energy consumption, and promote the application and dissemination of the concept of sustainable development in cloud computing. In this paper, we provide a new way of thinking for predicting energy consumption in cloud computing based on the data regression algorithm of Horned Lizard Optimisation Algorithm for Optimising Convolutional Neural Networks Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units."}, {"title": "RELATED WORK", "content": "The dataset used in this paper is selected from the open source dataset, which includes parameters such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of instructions executed and execution time, with energy efficiency as the target variable.

It is used to measure the correlation between the rank order of two variables without requiring the relationship between the variables to be linear. Spearman correlation analysis is performed on CPU, usage, memory usage, network traffic, power consumption, number of instructions executed, execution time and energy efficiency, the correlation heat map is shown in Fig. 1 and the correlation rank order of each parameter with energy efficiency is output and the result is shown in Fig. 2."}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "Random Forest is an integrated learning method that achieves tasks such as classification and regression by constructing multiple decision trees. Its principle is based on the idea of Bagging and random feature selection [5].\nFirstly, Random Forest generates multiple decision trees by Bagging method, which is a self-sampling technique where a number of samples are taken from the original dataset in a putative way and used to train each decision tree. This results in multiple decision trees that are independent of each other and reduces the risk of overfitting.\nSecond, in the training process of each decision tree, Random Forest introduces the mechanism of random feature selection. In each node division, only a random subset of features is considered for division, instead of all features [6]. This randomness makes the individual decision trees more different from each other and improves the generalisation ability of the overall model.\nFinally, in the prediction phase, for the classification task, the random forest determines the final classification result by voting (majority vote); for the regression task, the average of each decision tree is taken as the final prediction result. Since each tree is trained based on part of the data and features, the overall model has good generalisation ability and overfitting resistance."}, {"title": "B. Optimisation algorithm", "content": "The data regression algorithm based on the Horned Lizard Optimisation Algorithm for Optimising Convolutional Neural Networks\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (CNN-BiGRU) is an innovative approach that combines a bio-heuristic optimisation algorithm and a deep learning model. In this algorithm, HLOA is used to optimise the parameters of the CNN-BIGRU model to improve the performance of the data regression task [7].\nCNN is a deep learning model specifically designed to process image data by extracting features of the image through convolutional operations [8]. BiGRU, on the other hand, is a recurrent neural network structure for sequence data processing that captures long-range dependencies in sequence data. Combining these two models allows for better processing of data that contains both spatial and temporal information [9].\nThe schematic diagram of the Horned Lizard Optimisation Algorithm is shown in Figure 3. And HLOA, as a bio-inspired optimisation algorithm, is inspired by the ability of horned lizards to react and adapt quickly to environmental changes in nature.HLOA has a hierarchical structure and multiple optimisation strategies, which is able to balance the global exploration and local exploitation during the search process, so as to find the optimal solution efficiently [10].\nThrough the continuous iterative optimisation process, HLOA can help the CNN-BiGRU model to better fit the training data, generalise to the test data, and achieve better prediction results in data regression tasks. This approach, which combines bio-heuristic algorithms and deep learning models, has potential applications in dealing with complex data regression problems and shows strong performance performance and robustness.\nIn applying HLOA to optimise the CNN-BiGRU model, the fitness function, which is a measure of model performance, is first defined. The mean square error is chosen as the fitness function. Then, the hyperparameters and weight values in the CNN-BIGRU model are continuously adjusted using the HLOA algorithm so that the fitness function reaches the minimum value or converges to a satisfactory level."}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "This experiment was conducted using matlab to test the data regression algorithm models introducing random forest model and horned lizard based optimisation algorithm for optimising convolutional neural network-bi-directional gated recurrent unit respectively.Parameters such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE and R2 were used to evaluate the model effectiveness.\nMSE is the mean of the squares of the differences between the predicted and true values, the smaller the MSE the better the model fit, RMSE is the square root of MSE, RMSE is the same as the original data in terms of magnitude, which gives a more intuitive understanding of the magnitude of the prediction error, MAE is the mean of the absolute values of the differences between the predicted and true values, MAE measures the extent to which the predicted values deviate from the true values, the smaller the better, MAPE is the mean of the relative values between the predicted and true values, MAPE is the mean of the relative values between the predicted and true values, MAPE is the mean of the relative values between the predicted and true values. is the mean percentage of the absolute value of the relative error between the predicted value and the true value.MAPE can help evaluate the predictive accuracy of a model on different scales.R\u00b2 represents the proportion of the dependent variable (target variable) that can be explained by the independent variable.R\u00b2 ranges from 0 to 1, with the closer to 1 the better the model is fitted.\nThe results of the evaluation parameters for the random forest and optimisation algorithms are shown in Table 2 and Figure 4."}, {"title": "", "content": "This paper optimises the data regression algorithm of convolutional neural network-bidirectional gated recurrent unit based on the horned lizard optimisation algorithm for predicting energy consumption in cloud computing, which provides a new idea for studying energy efficiency in the field of cloud computing.

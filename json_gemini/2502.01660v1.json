INTRODUCTION", "content": "Employee turnover refers to an individual's termination of employment from their current organization\n(Joseph et al. 2015, Muchinsky and Morrow 1980, Price 2001). It is one of the most persistent challenges\nfaced by companies, particularly those in Information Technology (IT) industry that confront high turnover\nrates (Moquin et al. 2019). For instance, the overall turnover rate for all industries in US has steadily\nincreased from 23.7% in 2015 to 27.9% in 2019 (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2020); Moreover, as reported in\nthe survey (Society for Human Resource Management 2019), 49% of US employees have contemplated\nresigning from their current employers. Employee turnover is disruptive to the functioning of companies and\nincurs substantial costs associated with finding and onboarding suitable replacements. These costs\nencompass expenses related to separation operations, recruitment efforts, lost productivity, the training of\nnew employees (Hausknecht and Holwerda 2013). For example, the Work Institute conservatively estimated\nthe cost to be approximately $15,000 for each employee loss and the total costs associated with voluntary\nturnover have nearly doubled from $331 billion to $617 billion over the past decade (Mahan et al. 2019).\nTo alleviate this challenge, it is crucial to develop predictive analytics solutions to analyze and forecast\nemployee turnover, which can benefit multiple stakeholders. First, successfully identifying employees with\npotential turnover intentions and analyzing possible underlying factors enables employers to address their\nneeds and concerns more effectively to retain them (Mahan et al. 2019, Society for Human Resource\nManagement 2019). Such early intervention may lead to substantial cost savings. Second, an accurate\nprediction of future employee turnover can help recruiters seek potential candidates for vacant job positions.\nToday's recruiters primarily search for candidates based on the match between job requirements and\ncandidate qualifications (SocialTalent 2017). But some candidates with good match may have promising\ncareers at their current companies and lack the intention to switch jobs. The prediction of future employee\nturnover enables recruiters to focus on candidates who demonstrate a good fit for the vacant position and\nhave a high likelihood of changing jobs, thereby saving significant time and resources by minimizing efforts\nspent on individuals with low chance of switching jobs."}, {"title": null, "content": "Given the substantial benefits of turnover predictive analytics for both employers and recruiters, prior\nstudies have been conducted in both Information Systems (IS) and other related literature. First, some studies\nused survey-based approaches to analyze employee turnover and revealed interesting patterns of turnover\nalong different dimensions such as pay gap and gender (Joseph et al. 2015), industry sectors (Joseph et al.\n2012), job satisfaction and desire to move (Joseph et al. 2007), and perceived alternatives (Steel 2002).\nHowever, it is challenging to apply such survey-based approaches to massive employees across many firms\nto predict their turnover behaviors. With the development and adoption of various talent management IT\nsystems, including internal HR management systems (e.g., JazzHR) used by firms and publicly available job\nsearch platforms (e.g., LinkedIn and Indeed), massive talent data, such as internal employee performance\nrecords and public profession profiles, have been accumulated. The second group of studies have utilized\nsuch data to analyze and predict talent turnover and movement (Li et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2020). On the one\nhand, some prior studies have investigated turnover prediction within a single firm by using internal\nenterprise data (Li et al. 2017, Teng et al. 2019). Given the heterogeneity among firms and the lack or\nrestricted use (e.g., due to data protection regulations such as GDPR) of internal data, these solutions cannot\nbe readily scaled for the turnover prediction of employees across multiple firms. On the other hand,\nresearchers have also studied the talent flow among firms (Hausknecht & Holwerda, 2013; Y. Liu et al.,\n2020; Wu et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2021) by using public profession profiles. In these studies,\na talent flow network is constructed by aggregating the employee movement among firms, where nodes and\nlinks represent firms and aggregated number of transitions, respectively. Because these studies are based on\nthe aggregated talent flow among firms, they have not addressed the movement of individual employees.\nBesides, while competitor influence has been proved to be an important factor affecting employee turnover\n(Liu et al. 2020, Oehlhorn et al. 2019), it has been neglected in existing turnover prediction approaches.\nTo fill the aforementioned research gaps, this paper focuses on predicting individual employees' turnover\nacross different companies by utilizing public career profiles. Specifically, we formulate our research\nproblem as follows: given a set of career trajectories (i.e., sequences of job positions in employees' working\nhistories) as well as associated employees' and companies' features observed by a specific time, we aim to"}, {"title": null, "content": "predict the turnover likelihood of the employees in a subsequent period, such as six months. Tackling this\nresearch problem presents several methodological challenges. First, employee turnover is influenced by\ndifferent types of factors (e.g., employee and company factors). It is unknown and challenging to identify\nand operationalize these factors from massive semi-structural data. Second, competitor influence plays a\nsignificant role in driving employees' turnover decisions (Y. Liu et al., 2020), i.e., employees in one firm\nmay be inclined to leave due to the attraction of other firms. Incorporating such competitor influence into the\nturnover prediction model poses a great challenge. Third, employees' turnover intentions may be influenced\nby departed colleagues, i.e., employees may seek other opportunities because their previous colleagues with\nsimilar background find better jobs. Integrating such contagious effects into the prediction model is\nchallenging. Fourth, as career trajectories are essentially temporal and sequential data, there is intrinsic\ndependency among job positions within individual career trajectories. It is critical yet challenging to model\nthe dependency for predicting future turnovers.\nTo address these challenges, this paper develops a novel Cross-component Attention Transformer with\nConsideration of Competitor Influence and Contagious Effect (CATCICE) to predict the turnovers of\nindividual employees across different companies, in contrast to extant methods that predict either the\nturnover within a single organization or the aggregated employee movements among firms, but cannot\nproduce predictions for individual employees across many companies. To achieve this, we follow the design\nscience paradigm (Hevner et al. 2004) to guide the development of the IT artifact. Specifically, we apply Job\nEmbeddedness theory as the kernel theory to identify meta-requirements for the design process and propose\nmeta-designs to satisfy the meta-requirements, and we instantiate an employee turnover prediction system\nbased on the meta-designs.\nOur study contributes to the literature in threefold. First, we propose a theory-driven design framework\nfor predicting individual employee turnover across multiple firms. In this framework, we identify and\noperationalize three groups of driving factors rooted in theoretical foundations, and we construct a company\ngraph to assess competitor influence and a title graph to measure contagious influence in employee\nturnovers. Second, we design a novel cross-component transformer model to not only model time-"}, {"title": null, "content": "dependencies within career trajectory data but also integrate contagious effect and competitor influence in\nemployee turnovers. The designed model comprises deeply customized cross-component attention and multi-\nhead self-attention neural networks, which is substantially different from existing transformer models and\ncross-attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017; R. J. Chen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2019). Third, our\nresearch underscores the crucial role of kernel theories in design science research, specifically within the\ndomain of talent predictive analytics. Our study employs job embeddedness theory (Batt and Colvin 2011,\nRubenstein et al. 2019, William Lee et al. 2014) to guide the development of our predictive method, thus\nadvocating for the use of theoretical frameworks to inform the design of IT artifacts in a rigorous manner\n(Gregor and Hevner 2013, Li et al. 2020). We conduct extensive evaluations utilizing a real-world dataset\nand demonstrate superior performance of our method over several state-of-the-art benchmark methods. We\nalso estimate substantial cost savings for recruiters utilizing our turnover prediction solution, thereby\nvalidating its practical business value. Furthermore, we illustrate the attribution of the input factors to\nprovide interpretability and support HR managers and recruiters in comprehending the underlying rationale\nbehind the predictions of our solution."}, {"title": "2.

This field has evolved with the growing\nimportance of talent predictive analytics (Davenport et al. 2010), which focuses on predicting future talent-\nrelated events by analyzing internal and/or external career patterns in the data. The events considered in\ntalent predictive analytics include, but are not limited to employee turnover (Somers and Birnbaum 1999,\nTeng et al. 2019, Wang et al. 2013), predicting the next employer (Meng et al. 2019), wage prognostication\n(Vafa et al. 2022), promotions/demotions within a firm (Igbaria and Baroudi 1995, Li et al. 2017), and\nmovements among organizations (Joseph et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2020, Xu et al. 2019).

These related\nworks have studied three groups of technical methods for employee turnover prediction. We summarize the\nkey relevant studies in Table 1 where we compare them with our study from multiple important dimensions.\nThe first stream is survival analysis, which refers to a set of statistical methods for analyzing the time\nduration until an event of interest occurs (Lee and Wang 2003). Several representative survival analysis\nmodels have been applied to turnover prediction (Shen et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2008, Gu et al. 2020, Li et\nal. 2017). The second stream involves traditional classification methods, which treat the turnover prediction\nas a binary classification problem (Zhao et al. 2019). Traditional classification techniques, such as Logistic\nRegression and Gradient Boosting Tree (Zhao et al. 2019), have been applied to predict employee turnover.\nThe third stream involves modern deep learning methods, which has developed advanced deep learning\nmodels to tackle various turnover-related prediction tasks (Teng et al. 2021, Cai et al. 2020, Sun et al. 2019,\nMeng et al. 2019).

We posit that job\nembeddedness theory is an appropriate theoretical foundation to guide the design of a turnover prediction\nframework.\nFirst, the \"fit\" in the job embeddedness theory refers to an employee's \"perceived compatibility or\ncomfort\" with a company and its surrounding communities (William Lee et al. 2014). According to the\ntheory, an employee's attributes (e.g., personal values, skills, career goals, abilities) should align with the\ndemands and features of the company (e.g., culture, values, opportunities, financial status). A better fit\nindicates a higher likelihood that an employee will feel tied to a company, further contributing to a lower\nturnover intention (Mitchell et al. 2001). Additionally, the \u201cfit\u201d with the community and surrounding\nenvironment is also considered by employees when deciding to stay with or leave their current employers.\nAlthough the theory does not explicitly measure the influence of the match between employees and external\ncompeting companies on employees' turnover behaviors, as online recruitment become more mature and\neffective, the external opportunities presented by competing companies have emerged as an important\nconsideration for turnover decisions (Liu et al. 2020, Wright et al. 1994). The competition for human\nresources among companies is significant because human capital is a key factor for a firm to sustain a\ncompetitive advantage (Liu et al. 2020, Wright et al. 1994). Therefore, competitors can influence an\nemployee's turnover intention by presenting themselves as a better fit for potential recruits.\nSecond, the \"sacrifice\u201d dimension in the job embeddedness theory refers to the \"perceived loss or\nsacrifice\" associated with leaving a company. The loss could involve giving up colleagues, impactful"}, {"title": null, "content": "projects, or stock options, etc. The more an employee would sacrifice by quitting a job, the more difficult it\nbecomes for them to leave the company (Mitchell et al. 2001, Shaw et al. 1998). Opportunities for job\nstability and advancement, although less visible, are still important potential sacrifices to consider when\nleaving a company. The more deeply an employee engages with the company (e.g., higher job seniority and\nlonger tenure), the more opportunities for stability and advancement they have, further lowering their\nturnover intention. For example, marketing managers with more seniority tend to have lower intentions to\nleave than those with less seniority (DeConinck and Bachmann 1994). And the strength of an employee's job\ninvolvement in the company could reflect their perceived sacrifice associated with leaving (Mitchell et al.\n2001, Ramlall 2004, Shaw et al. 1998).\nThird, \"links\" dimension in the job embeddedness theory refers to the \u201cdiscernable connections\" an\nemployee has with other people and groups within the company. An employee is more bound to the job and\nthe organization when they have a higher number of links (Mitchell et al. 2001). In addition to the number of\nlinks, subsequent studies also investigated the contagious effect of colleagues via social connections (Felps et\nal. 2009). When frequent turnovers and discussions about turnover occur in a workplace, this turnover\ncontagious effect is likely to prime other employees, even those who are deeply embedded, to consider\nquitting (Felps et al. 2009). The turnover contagious effect may weaken their confidence about their jobs and\nthe company since many colleagues left the company, and simultaneously strengthen their self-confidence to\nseek comparable or better job opportunities elsewhere, as previous colleagues switched jobs successfully.\nForth, the dynamic nature of the job embeddedness influences employees' turnover decisions (Holtom\nand Darabi 2018, Thakur and Bhatnagar 2017). Subsequent studies posits that the assessment of job\nembeddedness is inherently dynamic (William Lee et al. 2014). First, an employee's perceived \u201cfit\u201d with\ntheir job role and the company evolves gradually due to personal growth, changes in job responsibility,\ngrowing desires, company culture shifts, etc. A better fit with the company can lead to greater job\nsatisfaction and embeddedness, decreasing the turnover likelihood. Conversely, the likelihood of leaving\nincreases if the \u201cfit\u201d deteriorates over time. Additionally, an employee's \u201cfit\u201d with competitors changes due\nto personal and external factors. Second, the number and strength of \"links\" an employee builds within the\""}, {"title": null, "content": "company tend to increase over time. And the contagious effect changes over time as the number of departed\nemployees fluctuates (Felps et al. 2009). Third, the perceived cost or sacrifice of leaving a company typically\nincreases over time, including loss of career advancement opportunities and benefits. For example, as an\nemployee's service time goes longer, they become more \u201cstuck\u201d to the company, and their turnover intention\ndecreases over time. As perceived sacrifices grow, employees are more likely to stay to avoid these losses."}, {"title": "3.2 Meta-requirements", "content": "Guided by the job embeddedness theory of turnover and subsequent studies, there are four essential\nrequirements for developing a comprehensive model for predicting employee turnover. First, it demands\nefforts to incorporate employee factors, company factors, and employee-company interaction factors for\nturnover prediction. In accordance with the dimension of \u201cfit\u201d to company, it is suggested the alignment\nbetween the employee factors and the company factors significantly influences turnover intentions.\nConsequently, it is imperative to define and operationalize these employee and company factors.\nFurthermore, the \u201csacrifice\u201d dimension suggests that a stronger job involvement within an organization\nindicates a higher perceived cost of leaving, thereby reducing turnover intentions. Therefore, the employee-\ncompany interaction factors (e.g., job seniority and length of service) should be integrated into the turnover\nprediction model.\nSecond, the dimension of \u201cfit\u201d to community implies that the influence of competing companies is\npivotal in employees' turnover decisions. Hence, it is essential to incorporate competitor influence into the\nturnover prediction model. To achieve this, the designed model should initially identify the competitors of an\nemployee's current company in terms of human capital competition (Liu et al. 2020) and subsequently\nmeasure the competitive influence exerted by alternative companies.\nThird, the model must account for the contagious effect on focal employees originating from colleagues\nwho have departed from the company. The dimension of \"links\" to colleagues suggests that turnover\ncontagion may weaken an employee's confidence in their job and company, thereby promoting their\ninclination to pursue better opportunities elsewhere. The contagious effects on a focal employee vary\ncontingent upon the strength of the connection between the departed colleague and the focal employee."}, {"title": null, "content": "Therefore, to quantify the contagious effect, the designed model should measure the strength of the\n\u201cconnection\u201d between a focal employee and a departed employee, and aggregate the cumulative contagious\neffects emanating from departed colleagues.\nFourth, considering the dynamic nature of job embeddedness, it is imperative to account for temporal\ndependencies of employee factors, company factors, employee-company factors, competitor influence, and\ncontagious effects in the turnover prediction model.

These individual factors\ninfluence employees' preferences for and behaviors associated with job turnover (Ng et al. 2007).\nThe career length, which represents the duration an employee has been employed, may influence\nturnover behavior in multiple ways. First, human capital theory suggests that as the career length increases,\nemployees acquire more experience and knowledge, rendering them more marketable and capable of\nturnover (Joseph et al. 2007). Second, the career mobility patterns vary temporally. On one hand, employees\nwould expect a rapid job progression at early stages, and subsequently, their careers stabilize gradually with\nhigher wages (Manzoni et al. 2014). On the other hand, career stage and development theories suggest that as\nemployees age, they exhibit lower turnover intentions since they are more satisfied with their jobs (Joseph et\nal. 2007). To this end, we define the Number of total working months as one feature representing the career\nlength for turnover prediction."}, {"title": null, "content": "Gender is another salient factor influencing turnover behaviors as female and male employees exhibit\ndifferent job movement patterns (Joseph et al. 2015). Female employees often reduce working hours and\neven suspend their careers due to family reasons such as childbearing (Sorensen et al. 1999). Meanwhile,\nprevious studies also found that female employees are perceived to have fewer promotion opportunities than\nmales (Igbaria and Baroudi 1995, Joseph et al. 2007). While the discrepancy effect is diminishing over time,\ngender remains an important feature that needs to be considered for predicting turnover events.\nEducation background plays as an significant role in influencing turnover (Iverson and Pullman 2000,\nJoseph et al. 2015, Kronenberg and Carree 2012, Sicherman and Galor 1990). Employees with higher\neducational levels usually expect more opportunities for job progression (Sicherman and Galor 1990).\nAccording to human capital theory, when employees with higher education are dissatisfied with their jobs,\nthey will turn over to other companies quickly because they are adept at collecting information on alternative\njobs and more proficient in utilizing their knowledge in different environments (Kronenberg and Carree\n2012, Ramlall 2004). Concurrently, companies tend to retain employees with higher education because they\nusually possess greater human capital (Iverson and Pullman 2000). Therefore, we consider The highest\neducation degree as one feature toward predicting employees' turnovers.\nAdditionally, prior studies have revealed that the frequency of changing jobs is a significant predictive\nvariable for turnover (Joseph et al. 2007, Ng et al. 2007, Vianen et al. 2003). For instance, employees who\nfrequently change their jobs often have needs to pursuit new challenges or rapid career promotions because\nthey seek to transition to other companies when their needs are unmet. Therefore, we define multiple features\nto measure employees' preferences for such needs, including Number of turnovers in the past, Average\nworking months in previous companies and Number of position changes in the past, and consider them for\nturnover prediction."}, {"title": "Company Factors", "content": "Company factors measure the characteristics of a company that affect employees' turnover.

Third, financial performance affects companies' investment in employee\nrelation policies and working environment, which consequently influences employees' satisfaction and\nturnover intention (Ng et al. 2007, Waddock and Graves 1997); poor financial performance is one of the\nmost salient reasons for employment downsizing such as layoffs, deemed as an effective way to reduce costs\nand improve financial situations (Cascio et al. 1997, Datta et al. 2010). The financial performance of a\ncompany could be measured by the following variables derived from financial statements: Revenue, Cost of\nrevenue, Net income, Earnings per share (EPS), Cash and cash equivalents, Total assets, Total debt, Total\nliabilities, Stock-based compensation, Operating cash flow, Investing Cash flow, and Financing cash flow\n(Revsine et al. 2021), all of which are considered for turnover prediction in this paper."}, {"title": "Employee-company Factors", "content": "Employee-company factors reflect the interaction between employees and companies (Muchinsky and\nMorrow 1980) that influence turnover.

Second,\norganizational commitment theory suggests that employees' commitment, which is the involvement strength\nof an employee in an organization, influences turnover (DeConinck and Bachmann 1994, Ramlall 2004).\nOrganizational commitment tends to increase as an employee's service time and job seniority increase in the\norganization, thereby lowering their turnover intention (DeConinck and Bachmann 1994, Ramlall 2004); and\nemployees with high seniorities often have to sacrifice more when they leave their current companies (Joseph\net al. 2007). Therefore, we define Number of months working in current company and Job seniority to\nmeasure employees' organizational commitment in our turnover prediction model. Third, Job title in current"}, {"title": null, "content": "company, which indicates job characteristics, is also related to employees' turnover (Joseph et al. 2015,\nRamlall 2004). Thus, we include it as another feature for turnover prediction."}, {}]}

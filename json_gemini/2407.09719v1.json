Material selection is usually carried out after several cycles of conceptual design, during which designers iteratively refine the design solution and the intended manufacturing approach. In design research, material selection is typically treated as an optimization problem with a single correct answer. Moreover, it is also often restricted to specific types of objects or design functions, which can make the selection process computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce MSEval, a novel dataset which is comprised of expert material evaluations across a variety of design briefs and criteria.

It involves making informed decisions about the materials used in various products, structures, and systems. Traditionally, material selection occurs after iterative design cycles, where design mod- ifications and manufacturing methods are refined. However, this approach often neglects the crucial role that materials may play in shaping the performance, cost, and sustainability of the final product.\nHistorically, material selection has often followed a manufac- turing first approach in which designers and engineers tend to pri- oritize manufacturing feasibility over material suitability. Conse- quently, this bias can lead to suboptimal material choices, affect- ing product performance, durability, and overall quality. Not all designers have extensive material expertise. Many lack the knowl- edge necessary to evaluate material properties, compatibility, and trade-offs effectively. Bridging this knowledge gap is essential for informed decision making. Material selection decisions made early in the design process significantly influence downstream activities, so it is crucial to ensure that these decisions align with the project goals and constraints.\nTypically, during the early design stage, material requirements are often expressed in the form of text and natural language. De- signers describe desired properties, constraints, and performance criteria in qualitative terms, which then need to be interpreted and translated into specific material choices. This process can be chal- lenging due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of natural language descriptions.\nThe recent development of large language models (LLMs) in the machine learning domain [1-6] presents a novel opportunity to streamline the material selection process in the mechanical de- sign domain. LLMs are a type of model capable of generating text. They have been used successfully in various domains, in- cluding design [7-13], where they have demonstrated the ability to generate innovative and creative visual and textual design solu- tions. As these AI systems continue to become more integrated into our daily lives, it is essential to effectively identify potential shortcomings, and ensure that they can handle complex, human- centric tasks effectively. Conventional evaluation benchmarks for LLMs frequently fall short in accurately assessing their overall ca- pabilities for handling human-level tasks. As a result, there is an increasing demand for a human-centric benchmark that enables ro- bust evaluation of foundational models within the context of tasks relevant to human reasoning and problem-solving [14].\nIn this paper, we introduce an evaluation dataset curated from human survey responses that is designed to evaluate the abilities of LLMs for the task of material selection in conceptual design. This benchmark is curated from responses from a survey sent out to professionals working in the fields of material science, material selection, and design engineering, among others. The responses come from people working with varying levels of experience, and therefore capture the variance in the thought process and inherent considerations that come with different design tasks. By focus- ing on these different design tasks, our benchmark enables a more meaningful and contextual evaluation of the performance of the large language model in scenarios directly relevant to material se- lection. The overall approach is shown in figure 1.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews literature that is relevant to the dataset. Next, Section 3 reviews the the methodology used to generate the dataset as well as the organization of the dataset itself. Section 4 discusses sev- eral possible ways in which this dataset might be used to support research. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the contributions and dis- cusses limitations and future work. Ultimately, we aim to drive innovation in developing more reliable AI assistants that advance toward this niche domain by identifying areas for improvement and understanding the behavior of humans better.

Material selection is a critical part of designing and producing any physical object. Material selection occurs in the early stages of the design workflow and maintains relevance beyond the useful life of a product. Materials directly influence the functionality, aesthetics, economic viability, manufacturing feasibility, and ultimately its en- vironmental impact of a design [15-17]. M. F. Ashby is often cited for presenting a systematic approach to material selection through the use of bubble plots, known as \"Ashby\" diagrams, which allow a designer to evaluate up to two material properties to identify those materials that perform above a desired threshold [18]. This approach requires an intimate understanding of a product's design intent, the design priorities (such as low mass), constraints (man- ufacturing process), and other requirements relevant to the object being designed (industry regulations). In recent years, additional factors have become increasingly important to consider too. Sus- tainability, for example, is a growing global concern and manu- facturing alone is reported to contribute significantly to resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, selecting ma- terials with lower environmental impact, such as recycled content or those that require less energy to produce, aligns with ethical practices and growing consumer expectations [19-21]. Material availability is also becoming a critical consideration due to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical challenges, or regulations on mate- rial use. The growing complexity of design requirements does not reduce the implications of improper material selection which can lead to increased overall costs, product failure, or greater environ- mental harm [22].\nIn product design, material selection is often decomposed into a general five-step procedure: (1) establishing design requirements, (2) screening materials, (3) ranking materials, (4) researching ma- terial candidates, and (5) applying constraints to the selection pro- cess [23]. Charts of performance indices and material properties, called Ashby diagrams, are often used to visualize, filter, and clus- ter materials [23,24].\nTraditionally, material selection has relied heavily on engineer- ing intuition and familiarity with existing materials.

In the first step 3.1, we collected materials selection perspectives from professionals through an online survey. Following the responses, we clean the responses to make two different variants of the dataset for different uses. In the final stage 3.3, we elaborate on the FAIR principles.\n3.1 Survey Design. To collect data to act as the evaluation data set, we conducted an online survey among professionals in de- sign, material science, engineering, and related fields. Specifically, our goal was to get responses from people with varied experience in the field of material selection for mechanical design.\nThe survey queried participants across 4 design cases (Kitchen Utensil Grip, Spacecraft Component, Underwater Component, and Safety Helmet for Sport) and 4 design criteria (Lightweight, Heat Resistant, Corrosion Resistant and High Strength) com- bined in a full factorial experimental design to produce 16 scenario- based questions. In each question, participants were asked to score a set of materials (steel, aluminum, titanium, glass, wood, ther- moplastic, elastomer, thermoset, and composite) on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 being unsatisfactory in the specific application and 10 being an excellent choice. These material categories were cho- sen to cover a breadth of design use cases, to find a balance be- tween high-level and low-level material categories, and to limit the length of the survey. An example of a survey question is shown in Figure 2. The survey also collected basic demographic informa- tion to ensure that participants had the necessary knowledge and background to provide strong preferences for material selection.\nWe utilized Qualtrics to design and deliver the survey. The sur- vey was distributed to professionals who have worked as materials scientists, materials engineers, design engineers, or related fields, via the Autodesk Research Community. The survey remained ac- cessible for 20 days.\n3.2 Dataset Organization and Description.

This bench- mark consists of survey responses from experienced professionals in the fields of material science and engineering, material selection, and design engineering. By focusing on scenario-based domain- specific tasks, MSEval enables a more meaningful evaluation of algorithmic model performance, bridging the gap between human cognition and machine capabilities in material selection.\nThis dataset is subject to several limitations. For instance, the data set covers only four design cases and four design criteria, which is not fully representative of the wide range of design sce- narios encountered in real-world applications. As such, the dataset does not capture contextual factors that influence material selec- tion, such as specific project constraints, economic conditions, regulatory requirements, or market trends. In addition, the nine material families used in this work are high-level categories, and nuanced differences between sub-categories, such as different alu- minum alloyss, are not addressed.

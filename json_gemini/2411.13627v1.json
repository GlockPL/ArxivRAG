This could lead to the adoption of distributed systems vulnerable to attack vectors. Formal verification methods, on the other hand, require complex and time-consuming techniques that lack automatization. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to assess the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously identify vulnerabilities in new cryptographic protocols through interaction with Tamarin: a theorem prover for protocol verification. We created a manually validated dataset of novel, flawed, communication protocols and designed a method to automatically verify the vulnerabilities found by the AI agents. Our results about the performances of the current frontier models on the benchmark provides insights about the possibility of cybersecurity applications by integrating LLMs with symbolic reasoning systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Verifying the security properties of communication protocols is a long-standing challenge in formal methods with significant implications for distributed systems. Cryptographic protocols such as SSH Lonvick & Ylonen [15] for secure internet communications, OAuth Hardt [12] for passwordless authentication, and 5G-AKA Arfaoui et al. [2] for mobile network authentication are essential to secure communication. However, despite their complexity, widely used protocols have often been found vulnerable after deployment. One notable case is the Needham & Schroeder [18] authentication protocols, which were discovered to have logical flaws only several years later Denning & Sacco [6], Lowe [16], highlighting the risks of insufficient validation.\nFormal verification aims to ensure that protocols satisfy specified security properties under a given threat model. Verification techniques are often hindered by challenges like infinite state spaces and undecidability (Even & Goldreich [10]), frequently requiring human intervention. As new protocol development accelerates with communication technology advances, there is an increasing need for automated solutions. In this work, we propose integrating symbolic reasoning tools with Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to automate vulnerability detection in cryptographic protocols. By combining the adaptive capabilities of LLMs with the rigorous deductive reasoning of formal verification systems, we aim to address this critical cybersecurity challenge."}, {"title": "1.1.

Background", "content": "To understand the design choices behind the proposed benchmark, it is crucial to comprehend the theoretical underpinnings of security protocols and their verification."}, {"title": "2.1. Security Protocols", "content": "Security protocols are distributed algorithms that multiple parties execute over shared networks to achieve security objectives such as confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.\nIn this work, we adopt the Dolev-Yao model Dolev & Yao [7], a widely used symbolic framework for analyzing the security of cryptographic protocols. This model abstracts cryptographic operations into algebraic terms, allowing researchers to focus on the protocol's logic instead of the specific implementations of cryptography.\nProtocols within the Dolev-Yao model are often specified using the Alice and Bob notation, which simplifies the description of message exchanges between participants. This notation abstracts the protocol into a sequence of messages exchanged between named entities (e.g., Alice and Bob). Each message is represented in algebraic terms, focusing on the cryptographic operations applied to the data. While intuitive, the simplicity of this notation can sometimes lead to ambiguities. To address this, we extend the notation by explicitly declaring participants' knowledge and fresh messages, ensuring a more precise specification suitable for formal verification."}, {"title": "2.2. Formal Verification of Security Protocols", "content": "Formal verification consists of mathematically proving that a system meets its specifications in all scenarios. Unlike empirical methods such as testing, which evaluate system behavior in specific cases, formal verification guarantees correctness across all potential states and inputs. This is especially critical for cryptographic protocols, which must defend against a range of attacks, particularly from active adversaries.\nIn Even & Goldreich [10] is shown that the unbounded verification of cryptographic protocols is undecidable. Consequently, verification techniques often impose constraints on the number of executions or restrict the attacker's knowledge Armando & Compagna [3], Turuani [22], making the problem decidable but potentially limiting security guarantees. Some tools maintain completeness through non-termination of attack searches Escobar et al. [9] or require human involvement in the verification process Meier et al. [17].\nIn this work, we choose a tool that follows the latter approach to explore whether an LLM-based agent can replace human intervention in performing this task."}, {"title": "2.3. The Tamarin Prover", "content": "The Tamarin Prover Meier et al. [17] is a robust verification tool that partially automates the analysis of cryptographic protocols, supporting a diverse range of real-world applications. With its flexible syntax, Tamarin allows users to define custom cryptographic primitives through equational theories, model intricate protocol dynamics via multiset rewriting rules, and specify security properties with first-order temporal logic. This adaptability makes Tamarin highly suitable for verifying a wide array of real-world protocols.\nA key strength of Tamarin is that its attack search algorithm is both sound and complete with respect to the Dolev-Yao model. This ensures that if an attack exists, Tamarin will find it (completeness), and any discovered attack is guaranteed to be valid under the Dolev-Yao assumptions, provided the protocol is formalized correctly (soundness). Tamarin's flexibility, including its advanced features for aiding termination, such as trace restrictions, source lemmas, manual proof guidance, and interactive mode, makes it an ideal platform for testing the iterative reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the ability of AI agents, particularly LLM-based agents, to identify vulnerabilities in cryptographic protocols using formal verification tools. This process involves several stages that systematically test the AI agents' capacity to formalize, interact with a symbolic reasoning system, and validate potential attack traces. The pipeline is inspired by real-world cybersecurity audits and is structured to mirror the steps taken by human researchers, thus offering valuable insights into the applicability of AI models in this domain."}, {"title": "3.1. Benchmark Pipeline", "content": "The benchmark follows a structured process in which AI agents interact iteratively with the Tamarin prover to formalize, verify, and validate cryptographic protocols. The pipeline is composed of four primary steps, also illustrated in Figure 1:\n1. Input: The AI agent receives a protocol in Alice-and-Bob (AnB) notation, along with an unsatisfied security property expressed in first-order temporal logic. This step reflects a real-world scenario where security auditors are tasked to analyze a protocol with known assumptions and expectations.\n2. Formalization: The agent must formalize the input protocol into Tamarin's syntax. To assist in this process, the benchmark includes a tool that automatically converts AnB notation to Tamarin's syntax. However, this converter has limited expressivity and does not handle security properties. The AI agent must consequently complete the formalization by making the appropriate adjustments."}, {"title": "3. Verification", "content": "Following the formalization step, the AI agent leverages Tamarin's capabilities through its built-in heuristics. The proof search can either terminate successfully, finding an attack trace, or loop indefinitely, requiring intervention. A common strategy to avoid non-termination involves introducing inductive support lemmas to assist Tamarin in completing the proof."}, {"title": "4. Attack Validation", "content": "If the AI agent discovers an attack trace, it must translate this trace back into the Dolev-Yao model. The trace is then tested in a symbolic sandbox, a custom tool designed to verify the validity of the identified attack against the original protocol. The sandbox ensures that the attack is executable, coherent with the input protocol, and a valid counterexample of the input property."}, {"title": "3.2. Dataset Generation", "content": "The dataset used in the benchmark consists of newly created cryptographic protocols, specifically designed to test the formalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs while avoiding potential pitfalls related to memorization. The protocols are curated with a focus on ensuring that each one contains a detectable vulnerability that the AI agent can identify.\nA hybrid approach is employed to generate this dataset. First, Few-Shot prompting with real-world cryptographic examples is applied using GPT-4, leveraging its ability to generate complex protocol dynamics. The synthetic examples are then filtered through a series of criteria, including executability, syntactic correctness, and novelty. Manual intervention is subsequently used to evaluate the most promising examples, ensuring they present challenging, yet detectable, vulnerabilities suitable for the benchmark.\nThe dataset includes 15 protocols of varying complexity, including standard cryptographic primitives such as encryption, hashing, and digital signatures. Each protocol is paired with a specific security property, resulting in a diverse set of test cases to rigorously evaluate the AI agents. By focusing on novel and unseen protocols, the benchmark effectively tests the AI's reasoning abilities rather than its capacity for pattern recognition or memorization."}, {"title": "3.3.

Both tools are planned for public release in the near future.\nMiddleware for AI Agent Interaction. Tamarin's extensive feature set, including its interactive mode and numerous debugging tools, is typically accessed by human users"}, {"title": "3.4. CryptoFormaLLM", "content": "CRYPTOFORMALLM is an LLM-based architecture designed to automate the formal verification and vulnerability analysis of cryptographic protocols through iterative interaction with the Tamarin Prover. Its primary function is to generate a clear and human-readable attack description by transforming a protocol and property specification into Tamarin's syntax, interacting with the prover to explore potential vulnerabilities, and outputting an unambiguous, readable attack trace that shows the discovered weakness.\nThe agent's workflow is structured into two main phases:\n1. Protocol Formalization and Setup: This phase prepares a Tamarin file based on the input protocol.\n1.  1 Translation of Protocols: The agent receives a cryptographic protocol in AnB notation, along with a formally specified security property, and translates it into Tamarin's syntax, defining rules, participants, and cryptographic primitives. A chain-of-thought and self-reflection approach ensures accuracy Renze & Guven [20].\n2.  2 Tool-aided conversion: The agent can use an automated tool Basin et al. [4] for assistance in translating the protocol, leaving property definition for the next task. The agent refines the prompt by adapting to tool feedback.\n3.  3 Refinement and Validation: With the help of the previous output steps, the agent refines a Tamarin script to achieve syntactical correctness and prepares the protocol for analysis, for example by introducing restrictions and support lemmas.\n4. Attack Trace Generation and Verification: This phase aims to generate an attack trace through Tamarin, translate it into AnB notation, and validate it.\n5.  1 Attack Trace Inference: It serves as a reference to assess the LLM's understanding of communication protocols.\n6.  2 Interaction with Tamarin5: The agent uses Tamarin to search for a counterexample revealing a vulnerability. If the process stalls due to timeout, it adjusts rules, restrictions, priorities or Tamarin command line arguments to support the trace search.\n7.  3 Trace Translation and Validation: The agent translates the attack trace back to AnB notation and ensures the generated trace aligns with the original protocol and security property, using a self-consistency prompt technique to confirm the validity of the identified vulnerability."}, {"title": "4.

To avoid ambiguity, we decided to specify the property in the input using the formalized Tamarin syntax, preceded by a title that references the relevant object within the protocol.

We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules. This establishes self-consistency as a synchronization challenge between sampling dynamics and evolving answer distributions.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Self-consistency (Wei et al., 2022) is a well-established decoding method that enhances model performance by aggregating multiple stochastic samples via majority voting.

By applying a majority voting scheme, it mitigates issues such as local optima and high variance that arise from relying on a single sample. Formally, it can be expressed as:\n\u0177sc = argmaxy (1/n  \u2211(i=1 to n) \u2161(yi = y)) \\tag{1}\nwhere yi is the i-th sampled answer, and \u2161(y\u2081 = y) is the indicator function that equals 1 if y\u2081 matches the candidate answer y, and 0 otherwise. The result, \u0177sc, is the answer with the highest number of votes (the top-1 answer).\nFrom a probabilistic perspective, self-consistency can be seen as a Monte Carlo estimator of the true answer distribution p(y | x). As the number of samples increases, the empirical distribution formed by the samples approximates the true distribution, and the most frequent answer aligns with the true distribution:\npsc(y) = (1/n \u2211(i=1 to n) \u2161(Yi = y)) \u2192 p(y | x), as n\u2192\u221e \\tag{2}\nAs the number of samples increases, the estimation becomes more reliable, and the voting mechanism converges towards the true answer."}, {"title": "Convergence Analysis of Answer Aggregation", "content": "According to Insights 1, since the accuracy of the true distribution is fixed, the performance of self-consistency is guaranteed to converge.

First-Second Distance (FSD) (Lyu et al., 2024) is employed as the confidence metric to quantify the gap between top candidates. Formally, at decoding step t:\nFSD(t) = p1(t) \u2212 p2(t) \\tag{6}\nwhere p1 (t) and p\u2082(t) are the probabilities of the top two answers from the first t samples. This metric directly reflects the model's uncertainty in distinguishing between the dominant candidates.\nTo ensure stable optimization, we design a conservative adjustment rule with a dead zone around confidence threshold \u03c4. The temperature T is up-\ndated based on the FSD metric:\nT(t+1) = {T(t) \u2212 0.1 if FSD(t) < \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b5, T(t) + 0.1 if FSD(t) > \u03c4 + \u03b5, T(t) otherwise, \\tag{7}\nwhere \u03b5 is a stability margin, which we set to 0.05 for simplicity. Temperature T is clamped to [0.1, 1.0] to avoid extreme values.\nPhased Sampling Strategy To balance exploration and efficiency, we employ a three-phase sampling protocol:\n\u2022 Exploration Phase: Collect small number of samples (n\u2081 = 5) with preset T(1) as a window to estimate initial FSD(1).\n\u2022 Adaptive Phase: Adjust T(2) through Equation 7, then generate n2 = 0.5N \u2212 \u03b71 (N: total budget) additional samples.\n\u2022 Exploitation Phase: Finalize T(3) and generate the remaining n3 = 0.5N samples.\nThe phased approach progressively shifts from broad exploration to focused exploitation. Finally, the accuracy is calculated by majority voting from the total of N samples.\nIn summary, our method dynamically adjusts the sampling diversity by monitoring the confidence levels, allowing for more efficient exploration and convergence.

We find that the average accuracy across different temperatures for dynamic temperature sampling outperforms fixed-temperature sampling in the majority of models. This suggests that our method is not constrained by the temperature range and can identify samples that are more effective for self-consistency performance across various temperatures. To some extent, this approach mitigates the performance loss caused by ineffective sampling at a single fixed temperature.\nFor different samples, dynamic temperature sampling searches for a more suitable temperature for each sample. Similarly, we observe that dynamic temperature sampling also provides a certain improvement in terms of the maximum accuracy. This can be attributed to the fact that different samples require different temperature ranges.

{"title": "Computer-mediated therapies for stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review and meta-Analysis.", "authors": ["Stanley Mugisha", "Mirko Job", "Matteo Zoppi", "Marco Testa", "Rezia Molfino"], "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of different forms of virtual reality (VR) treatments as either immersive virtual reality (IVR) or non-immersive virtual reality (NIVR) in comparison to conventional therapy (CT) in improving physical and psychological status among stroke patients.\nMETHODS: The literature search was conducted on seven databases: ACM Digital Library, Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, and science direct. The effect sizes of the main outcomes were calculated using Cohen's d. Pooled results were used to present an overall estimate of the treatment effect using a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials were evaluated. 3 trials demonstrated that immersive virtual reality improved upper limb activity, function and activity of daily life in a way comparable to CT. 18 trials showed that NIVR had similar benefits to CT for upper limb activity and function, balance and mobility, activities of daily living and participation. A comparison between the different forms of VR showed that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb training and activities of daily life.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study found out that IVR therapies may be more effective than NIVR but not CT to improve upper limb activity, function, and daily life activities. However, there is no evidence of the durability of IVR treatment. More research involving studies with larger samples is needed to assess the long-term effects and promising benefits of immersive virtual reality technology.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction.", "content": "Stroke has been described as one of the significant causes of death and disability globally, representing a severe problem for public health with a significant prevalence in men and women of all ages 1,2. Recovery is always incomplete, and most survivors are left with motor, sensory and cognitive impairments with a consequent increase in the burden of health care expenses during adulthood 3.\nOwing to the rising number of neurologically impaired survivors, several computer-mediated programs for stroke rehabilitation have recently been developed to help patients regain their ability to live independently. In particular, the advancement of digital technology has favored the assertation of virtual reality (VR) as an accessible solution to give patients feedback on their performance, meaningful goals, and a personalized experience to support motor learning 4,5. Training can be gamified through various applications, making the rehabilitation process fun and enjoyable. VR is a real-time, computer-based, interactive, multisensory simulation environment that enables users to engage in activities inside environments that resemble real-world artifacts and events to varying degrees 6-8.\nDepending on the quantity of visual sensory channels engaged in simulation, VR can be categorized as either immersive or non-immersive. Immersive VR (IVR) replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated 9,10. Users get the sense of being transported into three-dimensional interactive worlds through 360\u00b0 immersion in an alternate reality such as a head-mounted display (HMD) or video capture systems such as IREX, which enables them to participate in various activities in imaginary environments11\u201313.\nIn non-immersive VR (NIVR), the user mainly interacts with virtual objects displayed either in a 2D or 3D environment that can be directly manipulated on a conventional graphics workstation using a keyboard and a mouse. As in IVR, animation and simulation are interactively controlled to the user's direct manipulation with some NIVR systems and allow individuals to see their avatars reflected on the screen 14-17\nNon-immersive systems are characterized by a lower level of immersive features (e.g., scene changes with head movements), which could play a role in supporting the feeling of presence and its therapeutic benefits 13. For instance, it has already been pointed out how immersion in the virtual simulation plays a pivotal role in pain management by inducing relaxation.\nPrevious reviews have studied the use of VR in the rehabilitation of stroke 18\u201321. However, none of these works differentiated their results according to the VR modalities. Since the type of VR seems to influence the rehabilitation outcomes differently depending on the level of immersion 18,19, it is vital to unravel which form yields the best treatment effects for motor rehabilitation and other outcomes important to people with stroke such as quality of life and participation. Hence, by differentiating between IVR and NIVR systems, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of VR treatments in improving physical and psychological status in patients with stroke compared to conventional therapy (CT)."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Registration Number.\nThe review protocol and inclusion criteria were pre-specified and registered on the National Health Service Prospero Database under the registration number: CRD42019134806.

Higher values of effect sizes in favor of the NIVR indicated\nthat patients had improvements in upper limb function and activity, mobility, balance, and\nADL. However, their level of independence, which is the aim of rehabilitation strategies did\nnot improve as their counterparts who received CT. The magnitude of this effect was\ncomparable to that observed in previous systematic reviews. They concluded that using VR-\nbased therapy systems enhanced upper limb function, quality of life 18,20, mobility, and\nbalance 21 in people with stroke but not significantly greater than CT. There is an indication\nthat VR may alleviate upper limb motor impairments and encourage motor activities and\nsocietal participation among stroke survivors.\nMore improvements in VR could be due to several crucial factors. The first may be the ability\nto provide therapists with various training programs. The therapist may select different\ntreatment modes and construct an individualized training program that adapts the intensity\nand difficulty level of the training to the patient's current motor status 60. The potential of VR\nto scale difficulty levels and give adequate rewards to users in the context of gaming and\nlevel progression is vital to the implementation of effective VR training systems. Secondly,\nVR systems incorporate task-specific workouts in addition to an appropriate level of exercise\nintensity and repetition, from which patients can benefit. The majority of the included trials in\nour review comprised graded training regimens to induce optimal neural plasticity and\ncontinuous active engagement, both of which are essential for successful motor recovery after\na stroke 61. A recent review found that custom-built VR systems had a more significant effect\non the recovery of upper limb extremity function and activity than using CT 62. Customized\nVR systems are usually constructed based on a valid hypothesis to provide an effective\nrehabilitation regimen beneficial to patients 19,61,63. Therefore, the ability to configure a VR\ntherapy system with multiple training alternatives may be critical for upper-limb\nrehabilitation of motor deficits following stroke. Another reason could be the numerous types\nof sensory feedback like visual and aural present in VR therapeutic systems, which make the\ntraining more enjoyable. The use of virtual reality (VR) can assist in the creation of\nenvironments in which more repeated actions are done in a playful context, hence enhancing\nmotivation and adherence to therapy. The majority of the selected studies have taken into\naccount this essential factor, either through participation scales or questionnaires assessing\nthe level of motivation.\nBy differentiating the effects obtained by immersive and non-immersive solutions, our\nevidence suggests that IVR may be more beneficial than NIVR for upper limb function and\ndaily life activities. However, it is important to note that the results of IVR intervention are\nbased on short-term effects and few studies with a limited number of participants. We\nobserved that the effect size values of the results from studies that used IVR were higher than\nNIVR.\nA possible reason behind this phenomenon may be the missing depth cues in the 2D\nenvironments that characterize NIVR applications 64.\nPiggott et al. (2016) observed in their study that subjects using 2D VR systems such as cyber\ngloves tend to decrease their wrist extension 65.This could be resolved by using a head-\nmounted display (HMD). On the contrary, IVR systems take into account depth"}]}

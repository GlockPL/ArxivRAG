Introduction:", "content": "Global supply chains have experienced unprecedented strain the past few years. Due to the covid pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, impacted supply chains cause skyrocketing commodity prices and inflation. Such incidents have exposed supply chain network weaknesses and emphasized the need to improve SC resilience (SCRES). What supplies chain resilience elements refer to the ability of a supply chain to plan for its response to withstand and recover from any surprise disruption?\nIn the face of these issues, the strategic incorporation of sophisticated digital technologies has become one of the key methods for enhancing supply chain resilience. Among these technologies, the Metaverse and ChatGPT can revolutionize the supply chain. The Metaverse refers to a collective virtual environment, generated by the merging of virtually improved physical reality and a consistently existing virtual space, including digital technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), network communication, computing capacity, and blockchain. Then, this would lead us to a virtual environment that is very authentic and captures real-world supply chain settings. In other words, this virtual environment becomes dynamic and interactive as a simulated environment within which real-world decisions can be made in real time."}, {"title": null, "content": "Conversely, OpenAI uses ChatGPT, a large natural language processing model, which utilizes deep learning to read and write like humans. The technology can greatly increase the communication accuracy and efficiency within supply chains, which will then support the decision processes better and automate routine processes.\nThere should be a paper out there that brings Metaverse and the ChatGPT thing together in combination with supply chain resilience. We hope to illustrate their potential to mend current holes in supply chains by studying them in the context of modeling supply chain environments, accelerating real-time data processing, and enabling intelligent communication. We will also mention difficulties and issues in implementing them, such as the security of the data and its integration into existing systems.\nThus, the Metaverse and ChatGPT technologies battle in the supply chain area can be a step toward a more secured, lean, and robust supply chain that can withstand the chaos in this world."}, {"title": "2. Literature Review:", "content": "1. Supply Chain Resilience: Dimensions, Pathways, and Influencing Factors:\nOverall, these studies highlight the fact that supply chain resilience is multifaceted, with key dimensions being organizational capacity, collaboration, flexibility, and information systems (Michel, Gerbaix, and Marc, 2023).\nThese are developed by digital transformation, supply chain diversification, and supplier centralization, etc. (Weili Yin, Wenxue Ran, 2022).\nThere are also six critical resilience elements -- product supply, resources, partners, information response, capital, and knowledge -- that are suggested to highly impact resilience (Xianjun Zhu, Yenchun Jim Wu, 2023).\n2. Impact of Emerging Technologies on Supply Chain Management:\nEmerging technologies like the metaverse, AI (ChatGPT), and digital twins are transforming supply chain management. The metaverse enhances traceability and sales in agri-food supply chains and fosters green knowledge sharing and rational decision-making (Asmae El Jaouhari, Jabir Arif, Fouad Jawab, Ashutosh Samadhiya, Anil Kumar, 2024 & Ping-Kuo Chen, Xiang Huang, 2023). Platforms like NVIDIA Omniverse enable real-time simulation and planning, boosting resilience through digital twins (Dmitry Ivanov, Jennifer Blackhurst, Ajay Das, 2023). ChatGPT offers capabilities in route optimization, predictive maintenance, and data analysis, significantly improving operational efficiencies and decision-making in supply chains (Guilherme Francisco Frederico, 2023).\n3. Technological Disruptions and Their Broader Implications:\nDisruptive technologies such as blockchain, DAOs, and AI are reshaping not only supply chains but also broader networks like e-diasporas (Igor Calzada, 2023). The Industrial Metaverse, integrating extended reality and next-gen communication networks, shows potential for enhancing industrial production, despite challenges related to security and interoperability (Shiying Zhang, Jun Li, Long Shi, Ming Ding, Dinh C. Nguyen, Wen Chen, Zhu Han, 2024). The adoption of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in operations and supply chain management presents both significant benefits in efficiency and performance, and challenges related to security and ethical concerns (Alexandre Dolgui, Dmitry Ivanov, 2023)."}, {"title": "3. Methodology:", "content": "To effectively enhance supply chain resilience using new techmologies, we will adopt a two- phase approach that leverages the strengths of both the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey-TOPSIS (G-TOPSIS) methodologies.\nIn the first phase, AHP will be employed to prioritize a set of critical organizational capabilities, including Visibility, Agility, Flexibility, Security, Sustainability, Collaboration, Technology Integration, Risk Prevention Awareness, and Organizational Capacity. By decomposing these capabilities into a hierarchical structure, AHP enables decision-makers to conduct systematic pairwise comparisons, allowing for the quantification of subjective judgments and the assignment of relative weights to each capability. Such an organized process not only helps to clarify the most compelling factors but also keeps important objectives in check. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) promotes buy-in from all stakeholders by making the process both qualitative and quantitative. Prioritization can be extremely subjective, and inexperienced individuals often base decisions on seemingly objective factors such as severity or age of the problem. (Vargas 2010, opp. 12-13)\nIn the second phase, the Grey-TOPSIS (G-TOPSIS) methodology will be applied to identify and rank high-maturity organizational practices that contribute to the enhancement and development of the prioritized capabilities. G-TOPSIS, an extension of the classical TOPSIS method, integrates Grey System Theory to address the challenges posed by incomplete,"}, {"title": null, "content": "uncertain, or imprecise data common issues in dynamic and complex organizational environments.

G-TOPSIS allows organizations to translate their theoretical prioritization into a practical, applicable form and focus on \"best bang for your buck\" kinds of practices; thus ensuring that what resources they do have allocated towards capability development are used in the most efficient manner. It ensures a comprehensive evaluation process that enables organizations to improve their capabilities, reduce risks, and quickly and resiliently respond to changing market demands.

AHP Methodology:", "content": "The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a prominent method within Multi-Criteria Decision- Making (MCDM), a field dedicated to evaluating and prioritizing options based on multiple, often conflicting criteria. Developed by Thomas Saaty in the 1970s, AHP assists decision- makers in structuring complex problems into a hierarchical framework, facilitating pairwise comparisons among criteria and alternatives. (Hamed Taherdoost and Mitra Madanchian 2023 )\nThis structured approach enables the assignment of numerical weights to various factors, reflecting their relative importance, and supports the synthesis of these weights to determine the most suitable decision option. AHP's systematic methodology has been widely applied across diverse fields, including finance, engineering design, and sustainable development, due to its capacity to handle both qualitative and quantitative data effectively. By decomposing decision problems into a hierarchy of subproblems, AHP allows for a comprehensive analysis that incorporates both objective data and subjective judgments, enhancing the robustness and transparency of the decision-making process. (Nitin Rane, Anand Achari, and Saurabh Purushottam Choudhary 2023)\nTo create a framework using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, considering the criteria identified in the context of supply chain resilience, follow these structured steps:\nStep 1: Define the Problem and Goal\nClearly articulate the objective of your AHP analysis. For instance, the goal could be to evaluate and prioritize dimensions of supply chain resilience such as organizational capacity, collaboration, flexibility, and humanitarian culture.\nStep 2: Identify Criteria\nBased on the finding from the literature review, list the main criteria for supply chain resilience:\nOrganizational Capacity\nCollaboration\nFlexibility\nSustainability\nAgility\nVisibility\nCost Optimization\nSecurity\nTechnological Integration"}, {"title": null, "content": "Risk Prevention Awareness\nStep 3: Pairwise Comparisons\nConduct pairwise comparisons for each criterion to determine their relative importance.

The principal right eigenvector of matrix A is then calculated and denoted as 'w'.\nIf the matrix is incompatible and in case of incomplete consistency, pair comparisons matrix cannot be used normalizing column to get Wi.

Grey TOPSIS:", "content": "G-TOPSIS is an extension of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. Traditional TOPSIS evaluates alternatives based on their geometric distance from an ideal solution, identifying the option closest to the ideal and farthest from the negative-ideal. G-TOPSIS improves on this method by applying Grey System Theory, which is capable of dealing with uncertainty and information that is missing. (Re. K., Sohn, J., & Liu, X. 2010) This combination enables the G-TOPSIS to handle cases when data are missing or vague and is well suited for complicated decision-making systems. For example, G-TOPSIS has been used in the selection of cloud services, in which decision-makers have to potentially select one of numerous providers against incomplete or uncertain criteria. By integrating grey relational analysis into the traditional TOPSIS, G-TOPSIS offers a more comprehensive strategy for the ranking and selection of alternatives when faced with uncertainty, thus enhancing the validity of the decision-making process. Richard Nyaogaa, Peterson Magutu b, and Mingzheng Wang c, 2016).\nGrey TOPSIS Methodology Steps:\nDefine the Decision Matrix: Construct a decision matrix that includes the alternatives and criteria. Each element represents the performance of an alternative on a specific criterion.\nNormalize the Decision Matrix: Convert the decision matrix into a normalized form to make different units comparable. This often involves using vector normalization techniques.\nDetermine the Weighted Normalized Decision Matrix: Assign weights to each criterion based on their importance and multiply the normalized values by these weights.\nIdentify the Ideal and Anti-Ideal Solutions: Determine the best (ideal) and worst (anti-ideal) values for each criterion."}, {"title": null, "content": "Calculate the Separation Measures: Compute the separation of each alternative from the ideal and anti-ideal solutions using a distance measure.\nCompute the Relative Closeness Coefficient: Calculate the closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution, allowing for the ranking of alternatives.

And sustainability is given (13.5%), which is the most important for supply chain sustainability. Agility follows with 11.9%, underscoring the need for supply chains to be highly responsive to changing market conditions and disruptions in the marketplace. This ability enables companies to react quickly to changes, providing the adaptability needed to remain strong. Cost (10.9%) This ranked third. The significance of this lies in the company's realization that cost containment is crucial, as escalating expenses lower the profit margin unless mitigated by improved service levels. Managing costs effectively leads to more resilience, as firms are better able to survive when financial pressures increase in times of crisis. Visibility (10.8%) - Comprehensive insight into the supply chain enables better comprehension of supply chain trends and potential risks. Coming in at number four, this means that companies must spend money on technology and processes that create more supply chain visibility. And then by Technology (10.5 %) The incorporation of technology to facilitate operations and communication between the supply chain members is of less but still important concern, thus rating it fifth. Flexibility, at 10.41%, came in 6th, and indicates a requirement for supply chains to adjust their operations and frameworks in accordance with fluctuating demands and circumstances. Security (10.40%): Security is extremely important to prevent supply chains from being affected by outside influences. Risk prevention awareness (10.3%) comes in at number eight. This implies that organizations need to develop a thinking process of spotting risks, fixing the risks in order to prevent them from becoming major problems. Collaboration (5.7%) with supply chain partners"}, {"title": "3. G-TOPSIS results:", "content": "After ranking and defining the important capabilities to improve supply chain resilience through the new technologies. We defined 5 maturity factors that influence the development of Supply Chain.\nWe will apply the Grey-TOPSIS (G-TOPSIS) methodology to rank four critical maturity factors that influence the enhancement of supply chain resilience. The factors under consideration are Technological Proficiency, Collaborative Ecosystem, Agility and Responsiveness, and Cost Efficiency and Optimization. These maturity factors will be evaluated against the five more importance criteria ranked by AHP Method: Sustainability, Agility, Cost Optimization, Visibility, and Technological Integration. G-TOPSIS, by incorporating Grey System Theory, allows for effective handling of uncertainty and incomplete data, ensuring a more accurate and robust decision-making process. Through pairwise comparisons and distance-based evaluations, G-TOPSIS will enable us to identify the maturity factor that most closely aligns with the ideal solution while remaining farthest from the negative-ideal solution. This approach will provide valuable insights into which organizational practices should be prioritized to drive supply chain resilience and achieve long-term competitive advantage. (Mohammadreza SADEGHI1*, Seyed Hossein RAZAVI1, Narges SABERI2)\nTOPSIS as one of MCDM methods considers both the distance of each alternative from the positive ideal and the distance of each alternative from the negative ideal point. In other words, the best alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the longest distance from the negative ideal.\nIn this study there we choose the 5 best criterias and 4 alternatives as maturity factors that are ranked based on TOPSIS method. The following table shows the decision matrix."}, {"title": null, "content": "Through the Grey-TOPSIS analysis, four relevant maturity factors were revealed that affected the enhancement of supply chain resilience in the following order of priority: technological proficiency as the most influential, agility and responsiveness next, cost efficiency and optimization third, and collaborative ecosystem fourth. These results will allow us to gain useful information on the relevance of each factor and its direct influence toward achieving robust and responsive supply chains less susceptible to disruption and uncertainties in the marketplace.\nTechnology Proficiency ranks the highest with the closeness index (C1 = 0.787), thus confirming the fact that it is the most important in strengthening the resilience of supply chain. It points out that organizations which invest in innovative technologies like AI, blockchain, IoT, and automation are more capable of tracking supply chain processes in real time and predicting and preemptively attacking potential disruptions. Technology integration provides a level of visibility, predictive possibilities, and operational efficiencies that allow the business to see the risks earlier and adjust more rapidly. And that, put companies in a much stronger position when the supply chain disruptions are being able to leverage data-driven insights to improve logistics, improve stocking, improve purchasing, and so on. This outcome indicates that in the digital age, technological progress is a need, not a luxury, for resilience and lasting sustainability.\nThe second is Agility and Responsiveness (Ci = 0.651), which signifies that flexible and adaptable supply chain movements are important as well. Being able to react swiftly according to ever-changing market demands, supply shortages, or non-food/political redirection is vital in minimizing possible disruptions and ensuring the continuity of business. Then, agile supply chains are able to change sourcing, redirect shipments, scale up or down production all very quickly, thereby minimizing the blow of an external shock. This outcome reflects how"}, {"title": null, "content": "resilience is now at the heart of an organization's ability to stay dynamic and adaptable. Companies that embrace more agile processes and structures for decision-making will be better able to resume normal operations than companies with less responsive structures.\nCost Efficiency and Optimization (Ci = 0.484) is ranked third, showing that although costs and supply chain optimization are important factors of supply chain management, they still follow technological and operational flexibility in affecting resilience. Emphasis on lean and eliminating surplus costs can help profitability and waste, but too much emphasis on COST EFFICIENCY without flexibility and redundancy can create problems. These findings imply that cost optimization or cost minimization has only a supporting influence on resilience and that is should not be cultivated to the point that is retards the responsiveness and adaptability of the supply chain. Companies that find a way to balance the two achieve high inventory turnover while still being resilient to supply chain disruptions.\nCollaborative Community ranked the lowest (Ci = 0.242) only to emphasize the comparative significance of collaboration and interorganizational partnerships in building resilience. Collaboration with suppliers, partners, and stakeholders is required for joint risk management, information sharing, and response coordination, but its figure one ranking indicates that collaboration alone does not achieve the immediate, groundbreaking results that technology and agility can. Which could simply be indicative of the fact that unless one has top-notch technical skills and nimble-station architectures, it's only possible to produce so much through collaboration. However, continuing the creation of a cooperative environment is still an important element of long-term resilience in that it fosters connections, promotes trust, and strengthens the community's ability to endure changes.\nIn conclusion, the Grey-TOPSIS findings highlight that technological progress and operational flexibility are the primary factors of supply chain resilience, while cost effectiveness and collaboration serve as pivotal yet supportive elements. Entities aiming to boost their resilience must focus on investing in digital transformation, automation, and agile methods to develop strong and flexible supply chains. Although cost optimization and collaborative ecosystems enhance resilience, they need to be combined with technological and agile initiatives to form a comprehensive, resilient supply chain that can effectively handle future uncertainties and maintain a competitive edge.\nThese rankings reflect the role of each maturity factor in building supply chain resilience, directing organizations on strategic priorities to improve their operational efficiency in a more complex landscape."}, {"title": "5.

Among these, the Metaverse and AI-enabled applications like ChatGPT are transforming the way businesses improve visibility, agility, and interaction throughout their supply chains.\nThe metaverse\u2014a fully immersive, three-dimensional digital space-promises to be the ultimate space for supply chain efficiency. With simulated scenarios and on-demand monitoring, companies recreate a virtual twin of their supply chain, which provides accurate viewing and diagnostic of their operations. This ability improves visibility to track inventory, logistics, and bottlenecks - before they become problems. Virtual environments, for example, allow stakeholders to collaborate remotely and, despite their distance, can make efficient and well-informed decisions across the span of continents.\nMoreover, the metaverse supports agility and responsiveness by allowing businesses to simulate various scenarios, such as supplier disruptions or demand spikes. These simulations provide actionable insights into the potential impact of such events, helping organizations prepare contingency plans and optimize resource allocation. The integration of metaverse technologies into supply chain operations fosters resilience by enhancing decision-making and reducing the response time to disruptions. (Muhammad Turki Alshurideh, Barween Al Kurdi, Yousef ahmad Damra, Sara Yasin 2024)\nTools such as AI (ChatGPT) help supplement the resilience of the supply chain. And with ChatGPT ingesting oceans of data and understanding their implications, it can discern patterns, predict disruptions, and deliver actionable insights continuously. This function facilitates technology in providing a means to link communication gaps between different facets of the supply chain. The Effects of ChatGPT on Supply Chain Efficiency and Agility, 2023.\nFor instance, ChatGPT could act as a smart assistant to a supply chain manager, answering any question on demand, such as inventory levels, delivery delays, or supplier performance. Due to its human-like text generation capability, collaboration in the supply chain is supported as everyone on the team can collaborate to solve a problem more efficiently. Furthermore, by automating routine tasks like demand forecasting, order processing, etc., ChatGPT can free up resources for more strategic initiatives. (Zycus, 2024)\nBeing technologically savvy also helps promote sustainability and prevent risk, two key components of a resilient supply chain. By using the metaverse to find out exactly how they are either harming or helping the environment, organizations will have the visibility of the different footprints and hopefully use this type of technology to switch to more green methods of life. ChatGPT's data-driven insights similarly enable managers to foresee potential threats like vulnerabilities in suppliers or geopolitical disturbances, which then facilitates the implementation of preventative strategies. (Guilherme Francisco Frederico, 2023)\nIntegrating the metaverse and ChatGPT bolsters supply chain resiliency through a synergy, which can be considered a resilient final interpretation. By providing immersive visualization and intelligent decision-support for very complex operations, they manage both. This partnership converts conventional supply chains into flexible, vibrant networks that can grow in an uncertain business environment.

Conclusion", "content": "Integrating Metaverse technologies and ChatGPT into supply chain management could transform and strengthen resilience substantially. In our study, we applied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and G-TOPSIS methods and determined the five primary criteria that most enhance resilient supply chains: Sustainability, Agility, Cost Optimization, Visibility, and Technological Integration. Technology Competence was one of these major maturity factors required to best utilize these capabilities.\nIn summary, companies looking to improve their supply chain resilience should focus on the following as strategic criteria. By focusing on sustainability, they can ensure long-term viability and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment. Agility gives the ability to move quickly in response to disruptions and cost optimization protects the bottom line in difficult times. Visibility throughout the supply chain increases transparency and allows for more intelligent decision-making, and the implementation of technology creates a cohesive interaction of information and activities. Also, creating technological proficiency is an important factor here. With technology playing a more pervasive role in supply chains through artificial intelligence, data analytics, and other methods, companies need to develop their technological ability to fully exploit these modern technologies. Such competence will enhance performance as well as lead to the development of innovative ideas.\nIn conclusion, if companies successfully embrace these results and act on these suggestions, they can drastically improve the reliability of their supply chains and be poised to succeed in the uncertain global environment.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The development of modern cities has witnessed the significant growth of vehicles and the increasing time spent driving vehicles for daily transportation. Therefore, communication between vehicles has attracted widespread attention from researchers and industrial practitioners, and the vehicular social network has also become an essential part of modern networks. Collaborative vehicular social networks are increasingly crucial to the development of the V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communication paradigm [1], [2]. To make communication between vehicles more efficient and secure, it is necessary to enable efficient collaboration between vehicles while maintaining the privacy of data exchange. Cooperative data scheduling finds the best solution for efficient and secure data communication between vehicles [3], [4].\nDue to the highly dynamic characteristics of vehicles, large-scale ultra-low-latency communication in vehicular social networks becomes very difficult [5]. To provide real-time data services for vehicles, Wu et al. [6] use reinforcement learning to implement data packet forwarding of routing protocols in multi-access vehicle environments, and Sharma [7] and Awasthi propose a data scheduling algorithm based on priority services, estimating the deadline through fuzzy logic and adaptively scheduling dynamic vehicle information. To improve the reliability of data transmission, Xia et al. [8] proposed an incentive-driven privacy-preserving data scheduling for the Internet of Vehicles, using an incentive mechanism to achieve efficient data transmission scheduling. To improve the network's security, Zhang et al. [9] designed a weight-based integrated machine learning algorithm and established an intrusion detection model based on multi-objective optimization by identifying abnormal messages. However, the above-mentioned works fail to simultaneously meet the requirements of high efficiency and security of data transmission when dealing with large amounts of vehicles and data.\nIn vehicular social networks, providing real-time data services for vehicles is a challenging problem. First of all, the highly dynamic nature of the vehicle makes the communication time between the vehicles very short. Then, data processing becomes increasingly difficult with limited resources, and data processing on vehicles is expected to be more efficient in this highly dynamic environment. Finally, the data security issue among vehicles raises another concern. These challenges have brought great difficulties when implementing real-time, high-quality service to vehicles.\nTo this end, we propose a data scheduling algorithm based on Q-learning to achieve efficient data communication and processing while ensuring security. The proposed DSQL algorithm first considers factors such as the amount of data processing and the probability of encountering obstacles during transmission to improve the design of the reward function and combines energy consumption optimization to make communication more efficient Then, it performs sine function mapping on the input data to reduce the data range and improve the data processing efficiency of the multi-layer perceptron. Finally, it sets effective interference conditions by combining pseudonym entropy and uses differential privacy mechanisms to protect the reward values and action information of vehicles.\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as:\n\u2022 We propose a data scheduling algorithm based on Q- learning, which uses the amount of locally processed data to measure the size of the reward value, and optimizes"}, {"title": "II.

Problem Formulation", "content": "We formulate the data transmission scheduling as the opti- mization problem in this part.\nWithin the vehicular network, we assume that edge servers, vehicles, base stations, and terminal devices operate jointly to minimize service request time to the greatest extent possible. Considering certain rate-limiting conditions while harnessing the computing resources of vehicles and edge servers, we formulate the scheduling optimization problem in Eq. (1). The first line of the equation delineates the optimization target, which centers on orchestrating the scheduling of data files pertinent to applications with latency-sensitive requirements and allocating these files across a network of base stations.\nThe principal objective of this optimization is to facilitate the reception and return of data near the terminal node, thereby augmenting the capability for data processing while simulta- neously minimizing the aggregate cost, subject to constraints imposed by transmission durations.\n$\\min (P_{L}, P_{A}) \\sum_{Ux\\in U} \\sum_{fx(\\epsilon) \\in A} TT(PS_{x},UN_{x}(\\epsilon))$\ns.t.\n$\\TT (PS_{x},UN_{x}(\\epsilon)) \\leq \\tau, \\forall u_{x} \\in U, f_{x}(\\epsilon) \\in A_{x}$\n$r < r_{o}$\n$Reward \\leq Reward_{max}$\n$P_{L} \\leq Th_{L} < 1$\n$P_{A} \\leq Th_{a} < 1$ (1)\n$TT (PS_{x},UN_{x}(\\epsilon))$ denotes the total time required, and $PS_{x}$ is the path set. $UN_{x}(\\epsilon)$ is the unit of the file block, and $\\tau$ is the time. $U_{x}$ is the vehicles of area, and $U$ is the mobile node-set. $f_{x}(\\epsilon)$ is the file size, and $A_{x}$ is the mobile application set. $r$ is the transmission rate, and $r_{o}$ is the initial transmission rate. $P_{L}$ is probability of privacy leakage, and $P_{A}$ is probability of malicious node attacks. $Th_{L}$ is the threshold of the probability of privacy leakage, and $Th_{a}$ is the threshold of the probability of malicious node attacks. $Reward_{max}$ is the maximum reward, reward should be less than the maxi- mum reward. In addition, $\\frac{TT (PS_{x},UN_{x}(\\epsilon))}{PS_{x}UN_{x}(\\epsilon)} = \\frac{1}{r}$, without considering the priority of data resources, to make data scheduling between vehicles more efficient and secure, it is necessary to reasonably allocate and fully utilize data transmission resources.\nTo calculate the number of connected vehicles, we use the ratio of \"the number of hello messages received from all one- hop neighbors\" to the \"number of hello messages sent by all one-hop neighbors\". Such messages present unique serial number identification and thus can be used to calculate the total messages received. In addition, because a vehicle with a higher antenna has better connectivity to other vehicles, the height of the antenna can be used to measure the number of vehicle connections [6], which is calculated as Com (Connec- tivity Metrics):\n$Com(x) = \\frac{B_{x}V_{r}r_{r}}{V_{s}r_{s}}$ (2)\nwhere $B_{x}$ is the bandwidth of node $x$, $V_{r}$ is the velocity of vehicles that receive message, $r_{r}$ is the data transmission rate, $V_{s}$ is the velocity of sending vehicle, and $r_{s}$ is the transmission rate of sending vehicle.

Q-learning determines the optimal decision-making process by establishing relationships among states, actions, and reward values. Specifically, status repre- sents various data transmission statuses, including success, failure, or not transmission. When data transmission is suc- cessful, the next hop node receives the reward.

The longer the transmission time is, the larger the transmission delay is. It can be seen from Figure 11(a) and Figure 12(a) that DSQL has the best transmission delay performance, Shinde's scheme is second, AdPS is third, TDPP is fourth, Wu's scheme is fifth, and MRNN has the worst transmission delay performance.

As observed in Figure 11(b) and Figure 12(b), the transmission delay goes up as the distance increases. The network will consume more resources, and the transmission delay of the above six schemes also keeps rising. The reason is that all six schemes have low transmission delays because of a small amount of data delivered at the initial stage.

By combining human feedback and multi-agent reinforcement learning, the accuracy and reliability of generative AI technology can be improved, making full use of vehicle-specific data, driving data, and environmental data to perceive traffic conditions in real-time, provide drivers with accurate and reliable driving information, and avoid congestion and unsafe incidents. In response to the issues of generative AI technology safety and vehicle driving safety, by studying attack methods and formulating"}, {"title": "B.

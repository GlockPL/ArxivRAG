INTRODUCTION", "content": "The development of modern cities has witnessed the significant growth of vehicles and the increasing time spent driving vehicles for daily transportation. Therefore, communication between vehicles has attracted widespread attention from researchers and industrial practitioners, and the vehicular social network has also become an essential part of modern networks. Collaborative vehicular social networks are increasingly crucial to the development of the V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communication paradigm [1], [2]. To make communication between vehicles more efficient and secure, it is necessary to enable efficient collaboration between vehicles while maintaining the privacy of data exchange. Cooperative data scheduling finds the best solution for efficient and secure data communication between vehicles [3], [4].\nDue to the highly dynamic characteristics of vehicles, large-scale ultra-low-latency communication in vehicular social networks becomes very difficult [5]. To provide real-time data services for vehicles, Wu et al. [6] use reinforcement learning to implement data packet forwarding of routing protocols in multi-access vehicle environments, and Sharma [7] and Awasthi propose a data scheduling algorithm based on priority services, estimating the deadline through fuzzy logic and adaptively scheduling dynamic vehicle information. To improve the reliability of data transmission, Xia et al. [8] proposed an incentive-driven privacy-preserving data scheduling for the Internet of Vehicles, using an incentive mechanism to achieve efficient data transmission scheduling. To improve the network's security, Zhang et al. [9] designed a weight-based integrated machine learning algorithm and established an intrusion detection model based on multi-objective optimization by identifying abnormal messages. However, the above-mentioned works fail to simultaneously meet the requirements of high efficiency and security of data transmission when dealing with large amounts of vehicles and data.\nIn vehicular social networks, providing real-time data services for vehicles is a challenging problem. First of all, the highly dynamic nature of the vehicle makes the communication time between the vehicles very short. Then, data processing becomes increasingly difficult with limited resources, and data processing on vehicles is expected to be more efficient in this highly dynamic environment. Finally, the data security issue among vehicles raises another concern. These challenges have brought great difficulties when implementing real-time, high-quality service to vehicles.\nTo this end, we propose a data scheduling algorithm based on Q-learning to achieve efficient data communication and processing while ensuring security. The proposed DSQL algorithm first considers factors such as the amount of data processing and the probability of encountering obstacles during transmission to improve the design of the reward function and combines energy consumption optimization to make communication more efficient Then, it performs sine function mapping on the input data to reduce the data range and improve the data processing efficiency of the multi-layer perceptron. Finally, it sets effective interference conditions by combining pseudonym entropy and uses differential privacy mechanisms to protect the reward values and action information of vehicles.\nThe main contributions of this work are summarized as:\n\u2022 We propose a data scheduling algorithm based on Q-learning, which uses the amount of locally processed data to measure the size of the reward value, and optimizes energy consumption based on the distance between nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of data communication between dynamic nodes within the vehicular social network.\n\u2022 We use the sine function to map the data to a smaller range for processing through the design of the activation function of the multi-layer perceptron, thereby improving the data processing capabilities. Then, under privacy constraints, differential privacy is used to protect the vehicle's reward value and action information.\n\u2022 We verify the performance of the algorithm proposed in this paper through simulation experiments and conduct a comparative analysis with existing algorithms. Experimental results show that in vehicular social networks, the algorithm proposed in this paper is better than existing data scheduling algorithms in terms of accuracy, travel expenses, connectivity degree, transmission delay, and probability of privacy leakage.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses related work. Section III presents the system model and problem formulation. Section IV proposes the Q-learning-based data scheduling algorithm.

Overview of DSQL", "content": "Q-learning, classified as a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, has been empirically validated for its robust performance in vehicular environments that are both dynamic and uncertain. It demonstrates notable flexibility in adapting to environmental variations. Furthermore, it offers the benefit of supporting offline training regimens, utilizing datasets that have been pre-deployed. Q-learning determines the optimal decision-making process by establishing relationships among states, actions, and reward values. Specifically, status represents various data transmission statuses, including success, failure, or not transmission. When data transmission is successful, the next hop node receives the reward. Through Q-learning training, the edge server obtains data transmission decisions to adjust the actions of vehicle nodes and edge server nodes.\nDSQL consists of three parts, Q-learning empowered data communication, data processing based on multi-layer perceptron, and data privacy protection (as shown in Figure 2). In data communication, Q-learning is performed by exchanging results and parameters after acquiring data. First, calculate the power consumption and energy consumption based on the CPU frequency. Secondly, the amount of data is calculated based on the time difference and CPU frequency. Finally, rewards are calculated based on latency, packet size, and bandwidth. In data processing based on a multi-layer perceptron, the multi-layer perceptron includes six layers, namely the input layer, four hidden layers, and the output layer. Obtain data based on multilayer perceptron processing. The state in Q-learning is used as the input information of the multi-layer perceptron, and the income of the action, that is, the Q value, is used as the output information of the multi-layer perceptron. Finally, in data privacy protection, differential privacy and interference conditions are used to protect private information. First, the reward value, energy consumption, and transmission rate are calculated in Q-learning. Then the multi-layer perceptron is used to process the data quickly, and vehicles with high reward value, low energy consumption, and fast transmission rate are selected to make optimal decisions for data transmission scheduling. Q-learning updates the Q value and calculates the corresponding reward value under different conditions, as shown in Formula (4) (5) (6) (7), and then calculates the energy consumption value based on the CPU frequency and distance. Finally, calculate the transmission rate, and combine these three factors as the input of the multi-layer perceptron for data processing. During the data processing process of the multi-layer perceptron, an additional mapping process of the sine function is performed in the activation function so that the value does not exceed 1, thus reducing the difficulty of calculation.\nIn the following, we first describe the Q-learning-based data communication and then the multi-layer perceptron-based data processing. Finally, the amount of data transmitted is analyzed to elevate efficiency, and data privacy is protected by differential privacy. The pseudo-code of the DSQL is shown in Algorithm 1.

Q-Leanrning Based Data Communication", "content": "By employing reinforcement learning principles, Q-Learning facilitates iterative learning and enhancement through rewarding correct operations and penalizing incorrect ones, ultimately enabling the discovery of the shortest path for message communication. Q table is used to maintain the current information and historical information throughout the decision-making in Q-learning. The rows represent different states, and the columns represent the actions in the corresponding states. Through the interaction between the agent and the environment, the reward or punishment is fed back, and the value of the Q table is updated iteratively to reflect the learning content. The Q value is determined by the triplet of the destination node, the communication type, and neighboring vehicles, and the Q table is updated after receiving the hello message. The initial value of the Q value is set to 0, the space of the Q table is released as the vehicle moves, and the information of the new neighbor is stored. To save the space of the Q table, the vehicle as an edge node uses hierarchical routing to find the path.

A different number of image categories are randomly assigned within each distance range. For example, 2000 meters contain one category of images, while 4000 meters contain 2 categories, and the test set includes all three categories of image data. To observe the accuracy of the prediction, 300 images are randomly selected from the test set in each test iteration within each range distance and the process is run 15 times, and the result of the accuracy is finally obtained, as shown in Figure 8(a).

The scenes of 20-second length are manually selected to show a diverse and interesting set of driving maneuvers, traffic situations, and unexpected behaviors.

Shinde's scheme makes better network selection and offloading decisions through collaborative Q-learning, and the travel expense is higher than DSQL. AdPS scheme leverages the priority to schedule data, and the travel expense is higher than Shinde's scheme.

Transmission Delay", "content": "Figure 11(a), Figure 11(b), Figure 12(a), and Figure 12(b) show that the transmission delay of DSQL is the lowest. As observed, the transmission delay increases as time increases. As the data transmitted by the vehicle and the resources consumed increase, the transmission delay of the six schemes will also keep rising. The main reason is as follows. The longer the transmission time is, the larger the transmission delay is. It can be seen from Figure 11(a) and Figure 12(a) that DSQL has the best transmission delay performance, Shinde's scheme is second, AdPS is third, TDPP is fourth, Wu's scheme is fifth, and MRNN has the worst transmission delay performance. This is due to Q-learning between vehicles through enhanced multi-layer perceptron to make communication more efficient. As observed in Figure 11(b) and Figure 12(b), the transmission delay goes up as the distance increases. The network will consume more resources, and the transmission delay of the above six schemes also keeps rising. The reason is that all six schemes have low transmission delays because of a small amount of data delivered at the initial stage. The transmission delay continues to grow due to the increase in distance and unstable factors caused by high-speed movement.

As more and more communication resources are consumed in the network, the probability of privacy leakage of the above schemes decreases accordingly. The closer the distance, the higher the probability of privacy leakage. The high-speed movement of the vehicle increases the distances, and brings uncertain environmental factors simultaneously, thereby reducing the probability of privacy leakage.

First, the accuracy of parameter settings and the rationality of assumptions, such as the range and difference of car speeds on urban roads and highways. Secondly, it is difficult for simulation experiments to be the same as the real environment. For example, there may be pedestrians or non-motor vehicles that suddenly cross the road in the real environment. Therefore, attention should be paid to the scope of the application and restrictions of the simulation results. Next, simulation is an iterative process. The model should be optimized according to the results and performance to make it more adaptable to the practical Internet of Vehicles environment. Finally, because it is difficult to cover all scenarios under extreme conditions, it is necessary to consider the scenarios under extreme conditions as comprehensively as possible, make more comprehensive predictions on possible damages, and prevent vehicles from experiencing different degrees of harmful incidents."}, {"title": "VII.

They also proposed a deep reinforcement learning-based resource allocation method to improve the reliability and efficiency of information transmission. As smart cities require capabilities in sensing, communication, computing, storage, and intelligence, Chen et al.

They utilized potential use cases in smart cities and vehicular networks to construct a system architecture for the vehicle-as-a-service paradigm and pointed out future research directions for this paradigm. To enhance the generalization ability of the system, Tian et al. [49] proposed a unified framework based on the Transformer, VistaGPT, which includes a modular federation (MFoV) of vehicle Transformers for the automatic composition (AutoAuto) of autonomous driving systems. MFoV provides diversity and versatility to facilitate system integration, while AutoAuto leverages large language models to compose end-to-end autonomous driving systems. VistaGPT develops large language model-assisted transportation systems through capacity, scalability, and diversity, deploying scenario engineering systems.\nThe rapid development of generative AI technology has brought many opportunities for data scheduling in vehicular networks. By utilizing the multimodal capabilities of generative AI technology, data in vehicular networks can exhibit diversity, thereby providing a more reliable basis for decision-making in data transmission. By combining human feedback and multi-agent reinforcement learning, the accuracy and reliability of generative AI technology can be improved, making full use of vehicle-specific data, driving data, and environmental data to perceive traffic conditions in real-time, provide drivers with accurate and reliable driving information, and avoid congestion and unsafe incidents. In response to the issues of generative AI technology safety and vehicle driving safety, by studying attack methods and formulating defense mechanisms through V2X communication systems and privacy protection mechanisms, we can avoid the adverse information feedback caused by such attacks, which may lead to potential driving safety accidents. Therefore, generative AI technology can improve the accuracy and reliability of data scheduling in vehicular networks based on ensuring network security and driving safety, and provide high-quality service decisions for vehicle driving by utilizing vehicle data and traffic environment data."}, {"title": "B. The Impact of Mobility Model", "content": "To predict short-term traffic in the Internet of Vehicles, Chen et al. [50] proposed a new data dissemination scheme. First, a three-layer network architecture was proposed to reduce communication overhead and deep learning was used to predict short-term traffic conditions. Then, a two-dimensional delay model was constructed to assign road section weights. Through global weight information, an ant colony optimization algorithm was used to find the path with the minimum delay. To utilize the idle computing resources of surrounding vehicles, Chen et al. [51] proposed a distributed multi-hop task offloading decision model, including a candidate vehicle selection mechanism and a task offloading decision algorithm. Because of the impact of different hop numbers on task completion, neighboring vehicles within the k-hop communication range are selected as candidate vehicles. The offloading problem is transformed into a constrained generalized allocation model and solved by a greedy algorithm and a discrete bat algorithm. To meet QoS/QoE requirements at a low cost, Li et al. [52] proposed a new Internet of Vehicles architecture to jointly optimize network, cache, and computing resources to alleviate network congestion. The programmable control principle of software-defined networks is used to promote system optimization and resource integration. A joint resource management solution is proposed to minimize system costs by modeling services, vehicle mobility, and system status. As vehicles become connected entities and data centers, Labriji et al. [53] demonstrate the value of vehicle mobility and the value of combining such estimates with online algorithms that ensure service continuity for vehicles. They use the Lyapunov method to solve the problem, obtain a low-complexity and distributed algorithm, and evaluate the performance of the algorithm in a scenario with thousands of vehicles and densely deployed 5G base stations.\nThe mobility model of vehicles has an important impact on the Internet of Vehicles. The mobility model of vehicles minimizes delays by predicting short-term traffic conditions and uses the idle computing resources of surrounding vehicles to complete tasks. The mobility model of vehicles minimizes system costs under the joint optimization of network, cache, and computing resources, and is used in conjunction with online algorithms to ensure service continuity through interconnected physical vehicles and is evaluated in dense scenarios. Therefore, the mobility model of vehicles has a great impact on the Internet of Vehicles in terms of delay, cost, resource management, and service quality."}, {"title": "VIII. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This paper proposes Q-learning-based data scheduling (DSQL) for vehicular social networks. First, the DSQL uses Q-learning for data transmission. Secondly, the proposed algorithm processes the data quickly by the enhanced multi-layer perceptron to satisfy the requirement of the rapidity of the vehicles. The simulation results indicate that the DSQL is better than the state-of-the-art scheduling algorithm.\nIn our future work, we will study the detection of abnormal driving behavior in intelligent transportation systems. The use of the blockchain method will enhance the privacy of vehicles, and this will also promote the development of data security in intelligent connected vehicles."}, {"title": "APPENDIX", "content": "In the DSQL algorithm proposed in this paper, the con-nectivity is defined as $Com(x) = \\frac{B_x V_r r_r}{V_s r_s}$, where $B_x$ isthe bandwidth of node x, $V_r$ is the speed of the vehiclereceiving the message, $r_r$ is the data transmission rate of thereceiving vehicle, $V_s$ is the speed of the sending vehicle, and$r_s$ is the transmission rate of the sending vehicle. The ratioof the speeds of the sending and receiving vehicles and theratio of data rates are used for more accurate calculations.This is because the speed of the vehicles has a significantimpact on their connectivity, a factor that was not consideredin previous work. For example, the connectivity is determinedby the ratio $CM(x) = \\frac{Num \\  of \\ hellos \\  received \\  from \\  all \\  NBs}{Num \\  of \\ hellos \\  sent \\  by \\  all \\  NBs}$ [6"}, {}, {}, "0,1"]}, 802.11, 27, 802.11, {}, {}, 1, {}, {}]

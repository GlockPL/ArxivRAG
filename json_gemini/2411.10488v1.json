It's a place where\nconversations happen, decisions are made, and information is always at your fingertips.\"\n[14]\nMicrosoft Teams asks users to \"Meet the hub for teamwork\u201d, Workplace by Facebook proposes that\n\u201c...anything is possible when people work together\u201d and Cisco WebEx Teams exhort users to \u201cMake\nteamwork your best work\". [1, 2, 9] Taken as quintessentially modern team working tools, we might\nimagine these systems to be the future of work.\nThese tools promise to make collaboration easy by assembling all communication and resources\nof work in one place. Taking cues from social media, they are targeted at making teamwork more\nconversational, providing a digital place for those informal \u201cwatercooler moments\u201d. To intelligently\nwork without swimming in an ocean of communicative overload, all these services are moving into\nthe heady world of Al, where automation and modelling are set to support decision-making and put\nthe right information at one's fingertips exactly when needed.\nBut, what, we should ask, is work and team-work in the ways afforded in tools like Slack and\nTeams? How exactly is this work modern or indeed the future? What is it to collaborate, whether it\nbe in person or online, in this modern version of work? And how should we understand intelligence\nhere, as something that stands in as a proxy for an intelligent actor or as something that extends and\namplifies our own capacities? Needless to say, with a burgeoning market for new collaborative tools\nand indeed a renewed interest in research on collaboration and the workplace [10], there are a whole\nhost of questions that invite a much more careful scrutiny of contemporary work practices and the\nfuture of work.\nIn this short paper, we introduce work that is aiming to purposefully venture into this mesh of\nquestions from a different starting point. Interjecting into the conversation, we want to ask: \u201cwhat\nis it to be skilled at work?\u201d Building on work from scholars like Tim Ingold [5], and strands of\nlongstanding research in workplace studies and CSCW [3, 4], our interest is in turning the attention\nto the active work of 'being good', or 'being skilled', at what we as workers do. As we see it, skill\nprovides a counterpoint to the version of intelligence that appears to be easily blackboxed in systems\nlike Slack, and that ultimately reduces much of what people do to work well together. To put it slightly\ndifferently, skill as we will argue below - gives us a way into thinking about work as a much more\nentangled endeavour, unfolding through multiple and interweaving sets of practices, places, tools\nand collaborations. In this vein, designing for the future of work seems to be about much more than\nwhere work is done or how we might bolt on discrete containers of intelligence. More fruitful would be\nattending to how we succeed in threading so many entities together to do our jobs well \u2013 in \u2018coming\nto be skilled'."}, {"title": "SKILL", "content": "To develop our thinking on skill before venturing into the specifics of collaborative tools, let us for\na moment turn our attention to a highly skilled and collaborative practice, surgery. Perceived as\ninherently skilled, how exactly does a surgeon do his or her job well? To consider this question, we\nrevisit and apply a perspective of skill to some work previously reported by the second author, based\non fieldwork in a neurosurgery department at a large hospital in the UK. [8]\nOne of the vignettes in the report details how something goes amiss in a surgical intervention,\nduring a keyhole procedure (Fig. 1). A wire being threaded into a patient's spine inexplicably fails to\ngrip into the bone. We observe how the surgeon constructs a \u201cprofessional vision", "on": "the surgeon and his team acknowledge a\nsoftness in the bone and agree there are signs of cancer that need to be followed up.\nThe surgeon (along with his team) is, in the words of Tim Ingold, \u201cable continually to attune his\nmovements to perturbations in the perceived environment without ever interrupting the flow of\naction, since that action is itself a process of attention.\u201d [5] This is what sets the skilled practitioner\napart from the novice and shows that the surgeon's skill is not an attribute of their person or their job\ndescription, the skill is continuously and recursively enacted in the (collaborative) practice.\nTaking the surgical theatre as a form of organisational work, skill isn't something easily packaged\nup. Looking closely at the scenes from the perspective of skill, we find our attention drawn to the\nfollowing:\nSkill distributed across objects and actors First, for the team to successfully produce and align\ntheir 'professional visions' we observed the surgeon's physically manipulation of the wire and the\npatient's body while iteratively viewing X-ray images requested from a technician. In the indexical\nrequests, the assumed competence of the technician and the repeated enactment of 'trial and error'\ninvolving the surgeon, the wire, the spine, the technician and the X-ray apparatus we see how skill\nemerges, distributed across things and actors.\nSkill made visible in the practice Second, our attention was drawn to the moment the surgeon\nfirst perceives a softness of the bone, to the work of aligning what is now seen in the MRI scans with\nthe pre-operation interpretation. In conversation, silent contemplation, in repositioning bodies in the\nroom for perspective and again prodding with the wire we see how the surgeon and his colleagues\nmake skill visible through the practice.\nSkill coordinated across a range of actors Third, we noted how everyone (and everything) in\nthe room is active in the emerging skill and how the skilled activities are enacted in 'full duplex', with\nthe patient's bone responding to the prodding, the technician providing the requested image, a glance\nreturned, a wire held out to grip. In this continuously unfolding sequence of verbal and physical\nconsultation among the surgical team and the theatre we see coordination of skill across a range of\nactors."}, {"title": "WHAT ABOUT SLACK?", "content": "But what of distributed collaborative work? What of the distinctive spatial and temporal discontinuities\nafforded in the 'modern' workplace, and in particular tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams? How\nmight these ideas of skills sit in relation to the corresponding practices and say something about the\nrole of Al? Consider the example of triaging billing issues in a dedicated public Slack channel\na \"success strategy\u201d suggested by the developers of Slack [13]. Although, admittedly a slight leap from\nour surgery example, what we want to show is that skill becomes a helpful \u201ctool for thinking\u201d. [15]\nFirst, take the notion of skill distributed across objects and actors. What we begin to see is that the\nstructure of communication in the tool and what it enables and authorises is an integral part of being\nskilled as a team. The sequentiality of answers to questions, their timeliness, their indexical reference\nto prior turns and other resources, and so on, are made possible through the tool and become ways in\nwhich skill is conducted. If we are to imagine the impact of Al on the skilled work of teams, on how\nthings get done, what might then a modern and future version of work and team-work be, and what\nare the material consequences?\nSecond, with the notion of skill made visible in the practice we start to discover how skilled activity\nflows through, along and around the collaborative tool, how workers are invited to participate in\nand get notified of activity, how they participate in and choose to withdraw from activity and how\ndocuments and activity are enabled to coexist on- and offline. In the conception of Al contributing\nto the perception of skill-in-practice, what is it to collaborate, whether it be in person or online, and\nwhat new forms and notions of skill might then emerge?\nThird, the notion of skill coordinated across a range of actors opens up for an examination of skilled\nactivity not only across human but also non-human actors, external dependencies and internal analysis\nof interaction In an attempt to envisage Al's role as either a proxy for an intelligent actor or\nas something that extends and amplifies our own capacities, how are our conventional considerations\nof materiality reconfigured to understand the shifting sociomaterial assemblages involved in modern\nand future organising?"}, {"title": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "In recognition of work such as Orlikowski's [11] and her theorising of the \u201cpractice lens\u201d, our intention\nhere is not to formalise a general 'model' of skill to be applied across different practices. We do\nhowever hope to have shown skill as a useful starting point for the study of collaboration at work and\nhow we could think differently about the role for Al. In the workshop, our hope would be to, i., set\nout this thinking with skill as a resource for further discussion, and, ii., put skill in conversation with\nsome of the broader questions of global labour, [6, 7] and how it is we come to judge what counts as\nmodern (team) work and how its differentiated and uneven prescriptions might matter for setting an\nagenda for the future of work."}]}

India started focusing on open and digital education in 1980's and its efforts were escalated in 2009 through the NMEICT program of the Government of India. A study by the Government and FICCI in 2014 noted that India cannot meet its educational needs just by capacity building in brick and mortar institutions. It was decided that ongoing MOOCs projects under the umbrella of NMEICT will be further strengthened over its second (2017\u201321) and third (2021\u201326) phases. NMEICT now steers NPTEL / SWAYAM (India's MOOCs) and several digital learning projects including Virtual Labs, e-Yantra, Spoken Tutorial, FOSSEE, and National Digital Library on India\u2014the largest digital education library in the world. Further, India embraced its new National Education Policy in 2020 to strongly foster online education. In this chapter, we take a deep look into the evolution of MOOCs in India, its innovations, its current status and impact, and the roadmap for the next decade to address its challenges and grow. Al-powered MOOCs is an emerging opportunity for India to lead MOOCs worldwide.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "MOOCs in India have evolved significantly over the past decade, providing access to quality education, bridging the skills gap, and democratizing learning, with a future focused on localized content, emerging technologies, and partnerships with employers.\nChatGPT, 23:22, 14 May 2023.\nIndia is a young nation in an aging world. The median age in India is about 28, compared to 37 in China and the US, 45 in Western Europe, and 49 in Japan. This simple stats, known as demographic dividend\u00b9, is the main steam behind the resurgence and emergence of India as a global leader in various domains. Early this year (2023), India has surpassed China as the world's most populous country [1] and as one of the largest work-forces\u00b2 globally. During the next 25 years, one in five working-age group persons will be living in India. As ET rightly quotes [2] a report of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)\n\"If India's demographic dividend is productively employed, growth prospects will brighten, helping it to leapfrog its GDP from the current $3 trillion to $9 trillion by 2030 and $40 trillion by 2047.\u201d\nThis certainly is an extraordinary opportunity with a temporal window spanning nearly five decades [3] from 2005 to 2006 to 2055\u20132056. India will need to focus on the right policies [4] to reap rich dividends from this demographic transition.\nThe mammoth size of the work force alone cannot take the nation forward; in fact it may become a huge liability, unless this working age population is skilled and is employable. According to India Skill Reports 2022 and 2023 [5\u20137], employability in India has improved\u00b3 from 33% in 2014 to 46.2% in 2022, and to 50.2% in 2023. Yet, nearly half of the working population is still unemployable. This certainly is a big concern.\nRaising education standards, in both rural and urban sectors, is naturally of foremost priority [3]. Every child needs to complete high school and go on to skilling, training, and vocational education. Only schools with modern curricula, open digital universities for higher education, and adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at scale can contribute significantly to India's qualified workforce.\nThoughts about scaling the quantity as well as quality of education has been around since the onset of the demographic transition window\u2074. However, in 2013, Ministry of Education (MoE) undertook an in-depth study on the issue jointly with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI). The findings firmly corroborated the adoption of MOOCs at a national level. We quote:"}, {"title": "1.1 Background", "content": "Starting with Vedic Education (~1500 BCE) and subsequent Buddhist Education (~500 BCE) India has had a rich tradition of education systems since the Ancient era. It followed the Gurukul system of learning where the student (shishya) lived near or with the teacher (guru) and got educated through oral instructions (shruti) in an one-on-one interaction. Over time the need of scale led to the emergence of education hubs6 [11] at multiple places such as Takshashila (~600 BCE), Nalanda (~400 CE), and Vikramashila (~800 CE). These institutes continued with the gurukul style and drew learners from far and middle east. However, scriptures (written forms of education) started to complement shruti and group-instructions started to supplement one-on-one instructions. Education systems continued flourish in the Medieval (~600 CE-~ 1600 CE) and Early Modern (Moghul) eras (1526 CE\u20131850 CE) through the proliferation [11] of Maktabs and Madrasas at places such as Delhi, Agra, Jaunpur, and Bidar. Beginning of the Modern era witnessed the invasion of and capture by the British.

Many US universities started offering free online courses for the public and Coursera [16] (Stanford), edX [17]"}, {"title": "1.2 Motivation", "content": "In the last section, we have noted the transformation of education systems in India and the traction of MOOCs in India in the past decade. Recently, India's commitment to MOOCs has reached a new height with Government of India (GoI), in its Union Budget 2022-2023, announcing [30] the establishment of National Digital University (NDU) to offer exclusively online courses from various public and private universi- ties. Under NDU, courses will start from July 2023 and the students will be able to opt for certificate, diploma, or degree courses with credit mobility through Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) [31]. In view of this fast track for use and growth of MOOCs at national scale, it becomes imperative to study the evolution, present status, and future roadmap of MOOCs in India.

Typically, universities created contents and course providers distributed them [93]. For example, we had Coursera and Udacity from Stanford, edX from Harvard and MIT, or FutureLearn and 12 university partners in UK [76]. In contrast, MOOCs in India grew top-down through IGNOU, NMEICT, NPTEL, SWAYAM, and others, where the MoE coordinated the spectrum of initiative from open institutional education and educational content creation, dis- tribution, and certification in associations with HEIs. MoE funded the projects at national level as well. Similar initiatives (Section 1.1.1) have also been taken by China [42] (XuetangX [25]), Italy (EduOpen [26]), Israel (Campus-il [27]), Mexico (M\u00e9xicoX [28]), and Thailand (ThaiMOOC [29]) where all but XuetangX are free. Notably, no other free MOOCs are as large as SWAYAM.\nMOOCs need an ecosystem to exist, grow, and succeed. An ecosystem where Open Educational Resources (OER), OER Repositories, Open and Distance Learning (ODL), Open Credits and Certification, technology-leveraged processes (like Hybrid mentoring strategies, Industry Associates, Proctored Exams, Internships, and Credit Mobility), and most importantly a open mindset to accept and recognize education beyond the brick-and-mortar, exist and thrive in a harmonious manner. Further, this needs to be supplemented with technology (connectivity, authoring systems, interactions mechanisms, etc.), technical as well as domain expertise, and finances. In India, these happened over half-a-century mostly driven by MoE and partly in an organic manner and we chronicle the significant events of this period in Table 3."}, {"title": "2.1 Open University: Open and distance learning (1974\u20131985)", "content": "While pinning the onset of the process is difficult, we can trace this evolution to 1974 when Mr. Dipanshu Sharma from the Ministry of Education and Social Welfare organized a seminar [94] on Open University in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the UGC, and the Indian National Commission for Cooperation with UNESCO. On the recommendations of the seminar, the Gol appointed an eight-member working group on the open university under the chair- manship of Prof. G. Parthasarathi, the-then Vice-Chancellor (V-C) of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). The working group recommended (Working Group Report [94], 1974) as follows:\n\u201c... establishing an open university by an act of parliament as early as possible ... the university should have jurisdiction over the entire country so that, any student even in the remotest corner of the country can have access to its instruction and degrees.\"\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the working group and several years of deliberations and due diligence, the Indira Gandhi National Open University Act, 1985 (IGNOU Act 1985) [13, 14] was passed by both the Houses of Parliament in August 1985 and the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) came into existence on September 20, 1985. India's march on open education started.\nOver 1000 students graduated with diplomas and were convocated in 1989, audio- video courses were the first broadcast by radio and television in 1990, UGC recog- nized degrees from IGNOU as being equivalent to other universities in 1992, the first virtual campus in India via Internet was launched in 1999. Meanwhile, things started moving in other fronts in India.\nIGNOU has made a significant mark in the areas of higher education, community education, and continual professional development. It has been networking with reputed public institutions and private enterprises for enhancing the educational opportunities being offered by it. As a world leader in distance education, IGNOU has been conferred with awards of excellence by the Commonwealth of Learning (COL), Canada, several times. As of 2020's, IGNOU has [66]."}, {"title": "2.2 Online and digital education (1985-2009)", "content": "Soon after IGNOU, India started realizing that open and distance learning cannot scale unless the telecommunications and (then emerging) information & video technology are engaged in it. Also, ODL meant using a pedagogy different from face-to-face classroom teaching24. All these needed focused research in what emerged to be known as Educational Technology or EdTech today.\nIn 1987, Prof. Anup Roy [86, 95] moved to IIT Delhi from NITTTR, Chandigarh, and setup the country's first Educational Technology Services Center (ETSC) 25. Working with VHS video tapes and miles-long physical wires, ETSC created the first fully interactive remote learning scenarios. Further, Prof. Roy setup Center for Educational Technology (CET) at IIT Kharagpur in 1995 and launched ELNet-3 L: Electronically Networked \u2013 Life Long Learning [67] in 1997. During 1997\u20131998, CET also connected 15 studios with video labs at Kharagpur, Bhubaneswar, and Raipur26.\nLater in 1998, few directors of IITs and IIMs and some MHRD officials visited Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), USA, to learn online learning initiatives by Prof. Paul Goodman who had established an entire University in Mexico functioning completely on the Online Learning model. Impressed by the CMU model, hectic activities started for online education in India and NPTEL was conceptualized in 2001, initially for engineering education. By 2003, NPTEL (Phase 1) led by IIT Madras and collaborated by IITM, IITKGP, IITB, IITD, IITK, IITG, IITRm and IISc started creating video (recording of teaching) as well as web courses (animation with text). It soon created 100 of each type. Further, 700 courses were created by NPTEL (Phase 2) staring 2006. In Phase 3, by 2009, NPTEL moved to HD quality video courses and was scaling up in numbers.\nNotably, most of the efforts in this period were focused on creation of quality content and its dissemination to the interested learners. As the time progressed, naturally the quality of recording and editing improved, pedagogy was getting better tuned for online, and the dissemination mechanisms evolved from VHS tapes to VCDs to DVDs/ pen drives to downloadable media on the internet (streaming video was not easy yet27).\nThe initial growth phase for online and digital education was coming to an end and India was getting ready to launch herself at a national scale."}, {"title": "2.3 National Mission on education through information and communication technology (NMEICT): Initial period (2009\u20132014)", "content": "National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (NMEICT) [69] \u2013 the title says it all.

Completing a domain helps to gain expertise in a specific area [126]:\n\u2022 To gain expertise/foundations in an area of interest\n\u2022 To gain mastery to pursue Higher Education\n\u2022 To become more employable for jobs in the opted area"}, {"title": "3.3 Online graduation", "content": "Building up on online certification, which is for specific courses and domain certifi- cation, which is for a basket of courses from a domain, IIT Madras launched the world's first 4-year Bachelor of Science (BS) Degree in Data Science and Applications [65]."}, {"title": "3.4 Partnering and networking", "content": "From the early days NPTEL, and later SWAYAM, have been built on a strongly participatory model between various institutions. These partnerships and networks have been designed for course creation, delivery, and certification. On way to NPTEL- NOC, NPTEL realized that the success of MOOCs as a large-scale model for affordable education needs the engagement of students and the colleges that the students attend. Hence, the concept of Local Chapters (LC), at the colleges partnering NPTEL, was born.\nAs the industry engages the skilled man-power, SWAYAM/NPTEL needs to have close collaboration with it. The Industry Associate Program thus created by NPTEL, helps employment and course monitoring for effective skilling."}]}

In 2011, MSDs ac- counted for 12% of the nation's total burden of disease and injury and 23% of the non-fatal burden, ranking second only to mental health and substance use disorders. These disorders also have signif- icant economic impacts on both society and individuals. Back pain and related problems constitute 31% of Australia's MSD burden, with 17% attributed to occupational exposures. Previous research has found that workplace hazards are responsible for 37% of back pain cases globally. The economic burden of work-related muscu- loskeletal disorders (WMSDs) is considerable, encompassing health care costs, compensation, lost income, and early retirement. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study in 2012 highlighted low back pain as the leading cause of physical disability worldwide, responsible for 83 million years lived with disability [16]. A more recent report shows that the situation has not improved for WMSDs worldwide [3]. Consequently, primary WMSD prevention remains a key focus for researchers, practitioners, and organizations. Advances in wearable sensing technologies and machine learn- ing (ML) are proving particularly useful in addressing emerging research questions within work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD) prevention themes [22] [7] [4]. ML, a key branch of artifi- cial intelligence, is increasingly utilized across various industries due to technological advancements that enhance data collection and processing capabilities. ML involves using algorithms to optimize performance criteria based on training data and past experiences [8] [12] [24]. Researchers specify hyperparameters [23] that guide ML algorithms to \"learn\" from existing data, developing models that reveal underlying structures (unsupervised learning) or make predictions about new data (supervised learning) [15] [10]. ML al- gorithms are versatile, and applicable for regression, classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning. Unsupervised learning can identify patterns in datasets, such as using k-means clustering to find subgroups. Reinforcement learning determines optimal action sequences to maximize returns and has been used to provide tailored feedback in virtual posture training environments for workers. Su- pervised learning, the most common approach, classifies or makes estimations on new cases, exemplified by the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) classifier used for movement recognition. ML can model complex, non-linear interactions between numerous variables, mak- ing it well-suited for understanding the multifaceted etiology of WMSDs and aiding in their prevention. Despite a trade-off between interpretability and predictive performance, ML techniques are advancing primary WMSD prevention efforts [20] [21] [9] [2] [26]. However, most existing methods often fail to provide timely and personalized feedback, limiting their effectiveness in preventing WMSDs [6]. Recent advances in pre-trained AI models for human posture estimation present new opportunities for developing more effective solutions for real-time posture monitoring and correction [14]. For instance, Google's MediaPipe [11] enables the detection of human body landmarks in images or videos, allowing for the iden- tification of key body locations, posture analysis, and movement categorization using machine learning models that work with both single images and videos. This task outputs body pose landmarks in image coordinates and three-dimensional world coordinates."}, {"title": "Abstract", "content": "This research aims to develop a comprehensive system leverag- ing MediaPipe and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [25] to monitor lifting postures in real-time, assess associated risks, and provide immediate corrective feedback. The system performs de- tailed keypoint analysis to categorize postures based on correct and incorrect movements. The study follows a multi-phase approach, including extensive data collection, model training, and iterative development. The research highlights its unique contributions and effectiveness by comparing the proposed solution with existing lit- erature, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of the system's design, implementation, and evaluation. Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We proposed an LSTM model for risky lifting posture detection. 2. We implemented a dataset consisting of videos of good and bad lifting actions at differ- ent angles and distances. 3. We implemented a system that allows to use of MediaPipe to estimate pose and use our proposed LSTM model to prevent WMSDs through a webcam.

Identified papers strongly support the significance of posture analysis, par- ticularly through the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS method), shedding light on the risks faced by workers in various industries (e.g. the construction industry)[1] [13]. Moreover, a shift towards technological solutions is evident, with research emphasizing the integration of advanced technologies, including computer vision, image processing, and machine learning, to ad- dress occupational health and safety (OHS) concerns. The synthesis reveals a convergence of efforts toward leveraging machine learn- ing algorithms for posture estimation and recognition, highlighting the potential of adaptive systems to enhance accuracy. The pivotal role of computer vision and image processing techniques emerges as a core theme, focusing on real-time monitoring and analysis of postures during manual lifting."}, {"title": "2.2 Identified Gaps", "content": "The research identifies several critical gaps in posture recognition for manual lifting. Firstly, there's a lack of cohesive integration be- tween machine learning and computer vision approaches, with few studies addressing their synergies explicitly [6]. Secondly, the litera- ture primarily focuses on generic applications, neglecting in-depth analyses of specific industry contexts that are crucial for optimiz- ing system effectiveness. Thirdly, there's a gap in understanding the long-term efficacy of technology-driven solutions, with limited studies evaluating sustained effectiveness in preventing Muscu- loskeletal Disorders (MSDs) over extended periods. Furthermore, the reliance on limited and controlled datasets highlights the need for more extensive data collection efforts to enhance model robust- ness and generalizability [19]. Lastly, current models struggle with environmental and user variability, emphasizing the importance of developing adaptive algorithms for maintaining accuracy and effectiveness in real-world applications, particularly in dynamic manual lifting scenarios. Existing solutions, such as manual monitoring systems and generic computer vision applications, have limitations that hin- der their effectiveness in delivering instantaneous feedback and intervention. Human observers are prone to subjectivity and cannot consistently ensure timely correction, while basic computer vision models may lack adaptability and struggle to provide real-time insights. Therefore, there is a critical need for a more dynamic and responsive solution to address these shortcomings [26]. Traditional manual training programs exhibit limited effectiveness as they of- ten rely on periodic sessions, which may not maintain awareness and proper practices over time. Additionally, conducting regular, in-person training sessions is resource-intensive in terms of time and personnel. Generic ergonomic guidelines fall short of address- ing the specific needs of diverse job roles or industries, leading to suboptimal outcomes. These guidelines also lack personalization, failing to account for individual variations in physical abilities or health conditions. The use of wearable sensors faces challenges such as limited acceptance among employees due to discomfort, privacy concerns, or perceptions of surveillance. Moreover, the ef- fectiveness of wearable solutions heavily depends on the accuracy and reliability of the sensors used. Manual monitoring systems in- troduce subjectivity and may not provide objective and consistent assessments. Additionally, continuous manual monitoring requires dedicated personnel, making it resource-intensive and potentially impractical in large-scale operations. Generic computer vision solutions may struggle to adapt to di- verse environmental conditions, affecting accuracy. Implementing tailored computer vision systems can also incur high initial devel- opment costs, making it less accessible for smaller businesses [2]. Existing solutions often lack real-time feedback mechanisms, result- ing in delayed intervention and increased risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Without instant feedback, employees may continue un- safe practices without immediate correction. Web-based training modules without real-time monitoring lack the ability to actively engage employees during manual lifting activities. This limitation may result in inconsistent application of learned principles with- out continuous monitoring and reinforcement [5]. Some existing solutions underutilize data analytics, which hinders the ability to identify trends, patterns, or areas for improvement in occupational safety. The absence of predictive analytics further limits the abil- ity to proactively address potential risks before they escalate [12]. Understanding these limitations is crucial for developing an in- telligent solution that overcomes these challenges and provides a more effective and adaptive approach to occupational injury risk mitigation."}, {"title": "3 System Design and Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 System Architecture", "content": "The proposed system architecture integrates MediaPipe and an LSTM-based classifier to monitor and assess employees' postures during manual lifting.

LSTMs are well-suited for tasks involving sequential or time- series data [17], making them ideal for capturing temporal depen- dencies inherent in posture recognition during manual lifting activ- ities. Additionally, LSTMs possess memory retention capabilities, allowing the model to consider past poses when predicting the current one. This contextual understanding is crucial for assessing the dynamics of movements and ensuring accurate posture classi- fication. Furthermore, LSTMs excel in learning complex patterns within sequential data. Given the intricate variations in body move- ments during manual lifting, the LSTM model's ability to discern and analyze these patterns contributes significantly to the system's overall accuracy and effectiveness."}, {"title": "3.2 Dataset Details", "content": "The dataset used for this project consists of 62 videos, evenly di- vided into good and bad postures.

The detailed breakdown of the dataset is shown in Table 1."}, {"title": "3.3 Implementation", "content": "The initial part of the implementation involves real-time pose es- timation using the MediaPipe Holistic model. This is achieved by capturing video frames, processing them through the model, and visualizing the detected landmarks on the face, pose, and hands. The core of the implementation is the LSTM-based neural net- work. The model is designed to learn temporal patterns from the sequence of keypoint values. It consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by dense layers. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

An early stopping callback is implemented to monitor cate- gorical accuracy and halt training once a predefined threshold is reached, preventing the model from overfitting the training data. The trained model is evaluated using a test set comprising 25% of the data. The evaluation includes calculating a confusion matrix and accuracy score, providing insights into the model's performance on unseen data. The pose landmarker model in MediaPipe tracks 33 body landmark locations, as shown approximately in Figure 2. However, 11 of these landmarks are on the head, which is not relevant to our scenarios. Consequently, we excluded them from our model."}, {"title": "4 Results and Comparisons", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Visualizations", "content": "The summary of the experiment results is provided in Table 2, which highlights key performance indicators for the proposed model.

The approach begins with YOLOv7 for detecting body keypoints, forming the foundation for accurately capturing the nuances of various tennis shots. An LSTM model is then utilized to process the sequence of de- tected keypoints, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the player's movements throughout the shot execution process. The model's architecture is noteworthy, featuring 3 ConvLSTM2D lay- ers and 3 MaxPool3D layers, which enhance its ability to recognize the intricate movement patterns characteristic of tennis shots.

The robustness of the pose detection technique is particularly evident in its ability to capture the dynamic and high-speed movements inherent in sports activities, underscoring its applicability in such scenarios. However, while the methodology excels in tennis shot identi- fication, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The domain- specific nature of the approach limits its generalizability to other activities or postures outside of tennis. Additionally, the model's performance is closely tied to the specificity of the dataset used, which may hinder its adaptability to diverse datasets or scenarios. Another significant limitation is the absence of real-time feedback mechanisms, a critical feature for applications such as manual lift- ing tasks.

This system seamlessly inte- grates a computer vision component for continuous posture data capture, an LSTM-based model for sequential data analysis, and a user-friendly web interface that provides real-time feedback to users. A key innovation of our solution is the incorporation of a risk analysis framework, which categorizes postures based on risk levels and delivers immediate feedback on lifting techniques. Compared to existing approaches such as YOLOv7 with LSTM and LSTM Pose Machines, our model offers distinct advantages. It is purpose-built for handling continuous and varied postures in real-time, a capability that is not fully addressed by other solutions. Additionally, the integration of a risk analysis framework enhances the model's practicality, a feature often lacking in current models. This combination of improved accuracy, real-time responsiveness, and risk assessment positions our model as a pioneering solution in posture monitoring systems. The benefits of deploying our model are extensive. Primarily, it delivers superior accuracy in real-time posture correction, sig- nificantly reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Enhanced temporal data analysis ensures more precise posture tracking and correction, contributing to a safer work environment. This, in turn, lowers healthcare costs related to MSDs and boosts worker productivity. The inclusion of real-time feedback mecha- nisms and a user-friendly interface further enhances the user expe- rience, promoting adherence to safe lifting practices and fostering a culture of workplace safety. Comparative analysis reveals compelling results, highlighting our model's performance in real-time posture monitoring.

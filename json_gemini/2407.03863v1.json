We present MORPHADE (Morphological Autoencoders for Alzheimer's Disease Detection), a novel unsupervised learning approach which uses deformations to allow the analysis of 3D T1-weighted brain images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of deformations with deep unsupervised learning to not only detect, but also localize and assess the severity of structural changes in the brain due to AD. We obtain markedly higher anomaly scores in clinically important areas of the brain in subjects with AD compared to healthy controls, showcasing that our method is able to effectively locate AD-related atrophy. We additionally observe a visual correlation between the severity of atrophy highlighted in our anomaly maps and medial temporal lobe atrophy scores evaluated by a clinical expert. Finally, our method achieves an AUROC of 0.80 in detecting AD, out-performing several supervised and unsupervised baselines. We believe our framework shows promise as a tool towards improved understanding, monitoring and detection of AD. To support further research and application, we have made our code publicly available at github.com/ci-ber/MORPHADE.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Due to the increased prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and their effects on cognitive function, the study of such diseases is a highly active research field.

Firstly, we employ a 3D convolutional AE to enable the use of 3D images with the framework. Secondly, since PL uses 2D networks pre-trained on ImageNet, we employ an adversarial loss [9] to increase the realness of the reconstructions. We train a discriminator by minimizing this adversarial loss; therefore, the reconstruction loss becomes:\n$L_{recon} = MSE(x, x_{recon}) + \\gamma Adversarial(x, x_{recon})$,\nwhere \u03b3 balances the production of realistic reconstructions while maintaining pixel-wise accuracy.\nOur major extension to the deformable AEs is the use of a dual-deformation strategy, in which we employ an unconstrained deformer in addition to the constrained deformer, with the aim of improving the localization of atrophic regions. As previously stated, the constrained deformer is trained with a high value of \u03b2 to improve the generation of the pseudo-healthy reconstructions and thus reduce false positives in the anomaly maps. In contrast, the unconstrained deformer has the goal of reverting the pseudo-healthy reconstruction back to its original anomalous state. The deformer is trained with the same loss as in Eq. 3, but with a low value of \u03b2, which allows the creation of unconstrained deformation fields.\nImplementation. All networks were trained with Adam optimizer. The discriminator was trained with a learning rate of 1.0e-4, otherwise 5.0e-4 was used. The framework was first trained with a high value of \u03b2 = 10. We mo-"}, {"title": "4 Experiments and Results", "content": "Atrophy Localization. We first validate the effectiveness of our method in identifying atrophy in sub-cortical brain regions affected by AD. To achieve this, we used the FSL FIRST tool [18] to segment these regions and compute mean anomaly scores for each, shown in Fig. 3. Our results indicate that AD patients exhibit notably higher anomaly scores in the hippocampus (left: 0.282 \u00b1 0.495, right: 0.185 \u00b1 0.382) and amygdala (left: 0.132 \u00b1 0.207, right: 0.108 \u00b1 0.208) compared to the hippocampus (left: 0.108 \u00b1 0.193, right: 0.069 \u00b1 0.125) and amygdala (left: 0.066 \u00b1 0.115, right: 0.072 \u00b1 0.111) for the healthy controls. These results are in line with the clinical expectation of these regions being significantly affected by AD pathology [6], indicating that MORPHADE is able to identify atrophy in clinically relevant brain regions.\nAtrophy Severity. We next evaluate the ability of our method to determine the severity of the localized anomalies by comparing our anomaly maps to medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) scores [20] that were assessed by a senior board-certified neuroradiologist. These scores range from 0 to 4 and are assigned based on the degree of structural changes observed in the choroid fissure, the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, and the hippocampus. Fig. 4 shows a visual correlation between the degree of atrophy highlighted in the anomaly map in these key regions and the MTA scores, demonstrating the utility of our method in determining the severity of detected anomalies.\nPathology Detection. In this section, we assess the capability of MORPHADE in detecting AD at the patient level. Table 1 shows the Area Under the Re-ceiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) scores obtained when comparing our method to various baselines for identifying subjects with AD compared to healthy control (HC) subjects.

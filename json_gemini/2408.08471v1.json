This paper shows that surveys of important societal relevance introduce sampling errors that unevenly impact group-level estimates, thereby compromising fairness in downstream decisions. To address these issues, this paper introduces an optimization approach modeled on real-world survey design processes, ensuring sampling costs are optimized while maintaining error margins within prescribed tolerances. Additionally, privacy-preserving methods used to determine sampling rates can further impact these fairness issues. The paper explores the impact of differential privacy on the statistics informing the sampling process, revealing a surprising effect: not only the expected negative effect from the addition of noise for differential privacy is negligible, but also this privacy noise can in fact reduce unfairness as it positively biases smaller counts.

In the United States, for instance, this data underpins the allocation of a significant portion of the $1.5 trillion federal budget, with approximately $665 billion dedicated annually to social security programs that elevate millions of families above the poverty line [9, 12]. Major surveys such as the American Community Survey (ACS) [18], the Current Population Survey (CPS) [15], and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) [2] are central to gathering essential demographic data. The ACS, for example, annually collects data from approximately 3.54 million housing unit addresses across the United States (about a 1% sample of the entire U.S. population). This sample-based approach allows the ACS to provide detailed insights into the population's living conditions, educational attainment, employment, and health status, among other factors. The accuracy of these demographic reports is thus crucial to ensure that resources and policy measures are effectively targeted toward appropriate population segments. However, despite their critical role, the collection of these statistics typically involves surveying a small fraction of the population, inherently introducing sampling errors. While these surveys strive to provide estimates with controlled error rates and confidence intervals, such control is typically applied across the entire survey population. A key finding of this paper is to demonstrate how such an approach can lead to varying error rates among population groups, particularly those distinguished by ethnicity, introducing biases in critical downstream tasks relying on this data.\nTherefore, the first major contribution of this paper is to address the need for developing sampling schemes that not only aim to reduce costs but also meet acceptable errors within each demographic group.

The primary goal is to devise sampling strategies that minimize the sampling cost\u2014defined in subsequent sections\u2014while ensuring that the probability of an estimator's error exceeding a certain threshold ($\\gamma_i$) for each group i:\n$Pr(|Err(\\hat{\\theta}_i)| > \\gamma_i) \\leq \\alpha, \\forall i \\in [G]$,\nremains less than $$\\alpha$.\nUnfairness in this context is quantified by the maximum discrepancy in estimator's variances between any two groups,\n$\\xi_{var} = \\max_{i,j\\in G} |Var(\\hat{\\theta}_i) \u2013 Var(\\hat{\\theta}_j)|$,\nsince the goal of the survey process is controlling confidence intervals across various populations.\nIn the first part, this paper will discuss the development of optimal sampling schemes that balance the reduction of sampling costs against the constraints on estimator's accuracy for each group. Subsequently, we will examine the impact of privacy on the biases and variance of the various sub-populations, specifically when privacy-preserving counts $\\tilde{N}_i$ are used instead of the actual group population counts $N_i$. We next discuss the notion of privacy adopted in this study."}, {"title": "Differential privacy.", "content": "Differential Privacy (DP) [3] is a rigorous privacy notion that characterizes the amount of information of an individual's data being disclosed in a computation.

This relatively small sample size introduces inherent uncertainties, termed sampling errors, which are critical in understanding the limitations and accuracies of the data collected. The Census Bureau addresses these uncertainties by calculating standard errors and publishing margins of error at a 90 percent confidence level.\nThe sampling process in data collection efforts such as the ACS introduces at least two fairness issues: disparate error rates across different populations and disparate impact of privacy-preserving mechanisms on sampling errors.

The first phase adopts various remote data collection modes; for example, the ACS has used internet interviews since 2013 and computer-assisted phone interviewing until 2017 [13]. The second phase relies on in-person, door-to-door interviews, requiring the physical allocation of survey workers. Although more expensive, this phase aims to improve data completeness and reliability, especially in environments where remote methods are less effective.\nThe efficacy of each phase is distinguished by distinct failure rates\u2013 the likelihood that an individual, once contacted, does not contribute data. These rates are denoted as $F^1_i$ and $F^2_i$ for the first and second phases respectively and vary across different population segments i. The costs associated with each contact attempt are denoted by $c_1$ and $c_2$ for the first and second phases, respectively. Typically, the cost-efficiency trade-off is clear: remote methods (Phase 1) are cheaper but often less effective ($F^1_i > F^2_i$), while in-person interventions (Phase 2) yield higher success rates at a higher cost ($c_1 < c_2$). We define $g^r_i$ as the targeted or feasible sampling rate in region r once selected for phase 2. Further, $\\forall i$ represents the upper bound of acceptable error for population segment i (i.e., error rates depicted by the red dotted lines in Figure 2), and $$\\alpha$ as the probability that this limit is exceeded. We define the following program to"}, {"title": "4.2 Tractable Error Quantification", "content": "A key challenge with solving Program (2) is Constraint (2c), which involves a probability estimation. The lack of a closed-form expression for this probability hinders the direct integration of this constraint into the optimization. To address this, this section provides a tractable upper bound to be used in place of the probability in Constraint (2c).\nNote that, using Chebyshev's inequality, the probability of the estimator's error exceeding $\\gamma_i$ is bounded above by:\n$Pr(|Err(\\hat{\\theta}_i)| > \\gamma_i) = Pr(|\\hat{\\theta}_i \u2013 \\theta_i| > \\gamma_i) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i)}{\\gamma_i^2}$,\nwhere $\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i)$ represents the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_i$. This variance can then be estimated empirically, as done in practice [13], using prior data releases. This creates a statistical proxy, which is discussed in the Section 4.3.\nFor a given confidence level $$\\alpha$, from (3), we can replace Constraint (2c) by the stronger constraint $\\frac{\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i)}{\\gamma_i^2}<\\alpha$, and obtain a closed-form approximation for the threshold $\\gamma_i$ as:\n$\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i) \\leq \\alpha\\gamma_i^2$.\nThis new constraint strengthens the program by enforcing $Pr(|Err(\\hat{\\theta}_i)| > \\gamma_i) < \\frac{\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i)}{\\gamma_i^2} \\leq \\alpha$, which restricts the likelihood that the error in group i exceeds the desired $\\gamma_i$ threshold, thus tightening the optimization. The variance of the estimator $\\sigma^2_i(\\theta_i)$ can thus be expressed as\n$\\sigma^2(\\theta_i) = \\frac{C_i}{n_i}$,\nwhere $C_i$ is a constant that depends on the variance for group i. This follows from the variance of the estimator $\\sigma^2(\\theta_i)$ being inversely proportional to the sample size $n_i$.\n Thus, by substituting this expression into Equation (4), constraint (2c) can be replaced by the following tractable form:\n$n_i > \\frac{C_i}{\\alpha\\gamma_i^2} \\forall i \\in [G].$"}, {"title": "5 Private Sampling Scheme", "content": "The sampling design discussed above assumes accurate knowledge of population sizes; however, the confidentiality of collected micro-data is often legally mandated. For example, it is regulated by Title 13 [8] in the U.S., and, to comply with it, the U.S. Census Bureau used differential privacy for their 2020 decennial census release [1]. However, the use of DP mechanisms introduces perturbations in the data that may disproportionately affect smaller populations [12, 19]. This section studies how privacy-protected statistics could influence fairness in data collection.\nMore precisely, we consider population sizes $N_i$ released differentially-privately for each group $i \\in [G]$ and region r\u2208 R, emulating the census data release. Therefore, instead of having access to the exact $N_i$, the survey designer only has access to imperfect, noisy estimates given by:\n$\\tilde{N}_i = max (0, N_i + Lap(\\triangle x/\\epsilon))$,\nwhere $$\\triangle x = 1$ (sensitivity of the count query). We further note that the noisy counts are post-processed to ensure non-negativity (as is done in the U.S. Census [11]), here using the max(0, .) operator.\nThe challenge in this context is that noise can distort estimates of population sizes $$\\tilde{N}_i$, influencing the number of individuals $n_i$ who respond to the survey in each group i. This distortion affects errors in Constraint (2b) and compromises achieving the desired error targets and confidence levels. This section outlines our second key contribution: we offer theoretical insights into the biases introduced by using $$\\tilde{N}_i$ instead of $N_i$, while Section 6 will offer a practical analysis of these impacts. Our main result is a closed-form expression for the bias of the estimate $$\\tilde{N}_i$, showing that this bias is invariably positive."}, {"title": "6 Experimental Results", "content": "Next, the paper provides empirical evidence for the efficacy of the proposed optimization method on real-world data and settings first without and then with privacy considerations at hand.

However, this method disproportionately affects minorities, who receive fewer surveys and experience a higher variance of error at the group level. This discrepancy results in the worst fairness of variance ($\\xi_{var}$) observed (refer to table under Figure 4), and minority groups even fail to meet the confidence constraints set for their estimations!\nIn contrast, the Phase 1 Only optimization approach achieves a more uniform error variance across all subgroups while using the same budget used in the Standard Allocation method. Inspecting the optimization solutions, it can be observed that equity is achieved by allocating a similar number of surveys to each subgroup, irrespective of their population size. Figure 5 reports the number of survey allocations by race and by each method, and provides a clear view of the nature of the disparities. This redistribution significantly lowers the variance of the errors for minorities (including Native, Black, Asian, Other, and 2+), while slightly increasing it for the majority (White). Importantly, this approach enhances fairness and ensures all groups meet the confidence thresholds, addressing the main drawback of the Standard Allocation. In Section 7, we provide further discussion on why distributing surveys equally across subgroups is an effective alternative.\nNext, we focus on our main approach. As discussed in Section 4, phase 2 is characterized by a higher success rate ($F_i^2$ > $F_i^1$) at a greater cost ($c_1 < c_2$). Despite its higher per-survey cost, phase 2's low failure rate results in a higher number of successful samples for the same overall cost, making the Phase 1 and 2 method substantially cheaper (86% of Phase 1 Only cost) (see table under Figure 4). However, once regions are selected for phase 2, simple random sampling is executed at a 10% rate ($g^r_i$) from each chosen region. This method introduces some uncertainty in the number of successful samples for each subgroup, although the optimizer prioritizes regions with high densities of the targeted population. This slightly reduces the performance and fairness of variance compared to the Phase 1 Only optimization. Nonetheless, the Phase 1 and 2 method meets (by construction) the confidence constraints for every group, as empirically demonstrated."}, {"title": "6.2 DP-sampling: Errors and Fairness", "content": "Next, we focus on the setting with differential privacy, employing the privately adjusted counts $$\\tilde{N}_i$ as described in Equation (6).

The term $\\sigma / \\mu$, known as the coefficient of variation, is generally consistent across different subgroups. To achieve equal RSE, we need to ensure that n is similar across subgroups. If $\\sigma / \\mu$ is constant across groups, equal sample sizes would result in a fairness score $\\xi_{var} = 0$, indicating perfect fairness. However, if $\\sigma / \\mu$ varies significantly among groups, equal sample sizes will still lead to a lower fairness score. We calculated the coefficient of variation for each race in Nebraska, as shown in Table 2.\nImproved Motivation Figure. Referring to our motivational figure (Figure 2), we observe a significant improvement in the fairness score by allocating the same number of surveys to each race (i.e., heuristic approach), as illustrated in Figure 7. This suggests that surveyors can apply the heuristic method with the same sampling rate used in the Standard Allocation method to enhance fairness without relying on the optimization algorithm. Notably, the variance of error for Native Americans is smaller compared to other groups, despite the equal allocation, which can be attributed to their smaller coefficient of variation in Nebraska, as detailed in Table 2.\nRuntime Comparison.

This paper showed that in surveys like the American Community Surveys, traditional sampling methods disproportionally affect minority groups, leading to biased statistical outcomes.

Additionally, this paper examined the effects of differential privacy on the accuracy and fairness of the realized surveys. Contrary to common intuitions, our findings reveal that differential privacy can reduce unfairness by introducing positive biases beneficial to underrepresented populations. These findings are validated through rigorous and comprehensive experimental analysis using real-world data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization-based strategies in terms of enhancing fairness without compromising data utility and costs.\nWe believe that these results may have significant implications for policy formulation and resource allocation with critical societal and economic impacts."}, {"title": "A Experimental Details", "content": "Experimental settings.

To ensure meaningful analysis, we preprocessed the ACS data as follows:\n1. Handling Missing Values: Records with unknown income or educational levels were removed.\n2. Merging Sparse Racial Groups: To prevent issues with extremely small sample sizes, sparse racial groups were consolidated. For example, Asian subgroups (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Pacific Islanders) were combined into a single \"Asian\" category, and categories like \"two major races\" and \"three or more major races\" were merged into \"2 or more races.\"\n3. Merging Sparse Educational Levels: Similar to racial groups, educational levels with small sample sizes were combined. For instance, \"Grade 9,\" \"Grade 10,\" and \"Grade 11\" were merged into a group that consists of high school educated people who did not graduate, and \"No schooling\" and \"Nursery to grade 4\" were combined into a group consisting of people with limited education.

Cloning Weighted Records: Each record in the ACS data, representing multiple individuals via the PERWT attribute, was cloned by its weight to better reflect population distribution in our analysis.\nGeographical divisions. The smallest geographical unit provided in ACS data is Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA). Each PUMA contains at least 100,000 people in order to maintain confidentiality. However, due to the nature of large group size, PUMA is not a great representation of the geographical unit to be used during the second phase (door-to-door) of the survey.

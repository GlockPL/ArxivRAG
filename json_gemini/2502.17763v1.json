Introduction", "content": "With the rapid advancement of information technology, network security challenges have\ngrown increasingly complex. Traditional security mechanisms struggle to keep pace with the\nevolving landscape of cyber threats, particularly in large-scale distributed systems handling vast\namounts of heterogeneous data. The primary challenges in this domain are twofold: ensuring\nhigh detection accuracy across diverse attack vectors while maintaining data privacy in\ndecentralized environments. Existing approaches often fail to address these challenges\nsimultaneously, highlighting the need for innovative solutions [1].\nFederated learning has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine\nlearning paradigm, enabling multiple nodes to train models locally without exposing sensitive\ndata to a central server [2]. By aggregating local model updates, federated learning enhances\nglobal model performance while minimizing security risks associated with centralized data\nstorage and transmission. However, traditional federated learning methods face limitations\nwhen processing complex, multimodal data streams commonly found in modern security\nenvironments.\nRecent advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new\ncapabilities for processing heterogeneous security data, including network traffic, system logs,\nimages, and sensor data [3]. Conventional threat detection systems typically rely on single-\nmodality analysis, reducing their effectiveness against sophisticated cyberattacks. In contrast,\nmultimodal LLMs enable the simultaneous integration and interpretation of diverse data\nsources, leading to more comprehensive threat detection and improved generalization across\ndifferent attack patterns.\nThis paper presents a novel distributed security threat detection system that integrates\nfederated learning with multimodal LLMs, addressing the shortcomings of existing security\nframeworks. The key contributions of our work are as follows:\n\u2022\nA privacy-preserving distributed architecture that enables efficient processing of large-\nscale security data across multiple nodes.\n\u2022\nA novel integration of multimodal LLMs with federated learning, enhancing threat\ndetection capabilities through comprehensive data fusion.\n\u2022\nA scalable multi-node parallel training system that improves detection accuracy while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.\n\u2022\nExtensive experimental validation, demonstrating significant improvements in\ndetection accuracy, response time, and system robustness while ensuring data privacy.\nBy leveraging federated learning for data privacy and harnessing the analytical power of\nmultimodal LLMs, our proposed system significantly enhances cyber threat detection accuracy\nand efficiency in large-scale distributed environments.

Consequently,\nresearchers and institutions have focused on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques\nto enhance the efficiency and accuracy of security threat detection, particularly in distributed\nsettings. In recent years, the integration of federated learning and multimodal learning has\nemerged as a promising research direction in cybersecurity.\nFederated learning, a distributed machine learning paradigm, offers significant advantages\nin preserving data privacy. First introduced by Google in 2016, federated learning enables\nmodel training across decentralized data sources while mitigating security risks associated with\ncentralized data storage. Early research primarily concentrated on optimizing federated learning\nalgorithms and enhancing data privacy protection. A major breakthrough in this domain was\nthe development of the FedAvg algorithm, which enables distributed training without direct\ndata exchange by employing local model updates and global aggregation [4].

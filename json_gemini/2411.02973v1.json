{"title": "[Vision Paper] PRObot: Enhancing Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Diabetic Retinopathy using Chatbots and Generative AI", "authors": ["Maren Pielka", "Tobias Schneider", "Jan Terheyden", "Rafet Sifa"], "abstract": "We present an outline of the first large language model (LLM) based chatbot application in the context of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for diabetic retinopathy. By utilizing the capabilities of current LLMs, we enable patients to provide feedback about their quality of life and treatment progress via an interactive application. The proposed framework offers significant advantages over the current approach, which encompasses only qualitative collection of survey data or a static survey with limited answer options. Using the PROBot LLM-PROM application, patients will be asked tailored questions about their individual challenges, and can give more detailed feedback on the progress of their treatment. Based on this input, we will use machine learning to infer conventional PROM scores, which can be used by clinicians to evaluate the treatment status. The goal of the application is to improve adherence to the healthcare system and treatments, and thus ultimately reduce cases of subsequent vision impairment. The approach needs to be further validated using a survey and a clinical study.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Monitoring chronic eye diseases is increasingly based on data from imaging exams, functional tests and self-reports of patients. While treatment decisions in medicine depend on all three columns, quantitative data are often available only for imaging biomarkers and functional assessments, while symptoms and health behaviors are mostly assessed qual-itatively. Structured questionnaires such as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), e.g. the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI-VFQ-25) [14], [15], are increasingly used to foster patient-centered care and provide quantitative metrics of patient-reports to clinicians. However, they have been developed in the context of clinical trials and are therefore highly static and not necessarily user-friendly. In PROM questionnaires, patients are asked questions e.g. about their physical and mental well-being, which are to be answered with a score on a numerical scale."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "PROMs are established and well-researched instruments for collecting patient-recorded data. However, due to their static design, PROMs are limited in the information they can capture, as any information not covered by PROM items cannot be recorded. Designing and validating a PROM questionnaire is a complex and time-consuming iterative process. But even the items of an established and well-calibrated PROM can have a varying relevance due to the strong differences in humans. For example, in the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire [14], [15], the influence of people's eyesight on mobility in everyday life is primarily measured by questions relating to driving a car. However, these questions might be irrelevant for many individuals.\nWe propose a novel PROM framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to perform a dynamic and more person-alized survey of patients. Instead of relying on static questions and predefined answer options, this framework is based on an interactive chat environment in which patients can respond with free text. Answers based on free text can convey much more information, enabling a more refined and personalized evaluation of responses. Additionally, this framework can perform personalized and dynamic questioning for individual patients, using general information about the patient, previous interviews, and even the current chat history to improve the relevance of questions. A chat environment is also capable of responding to the free text answers written by the patients. For example, a chatbot could react emphatically and optimistically to negative responses. If a patient reports improvements, a chatbot could react positively to help the patient value positive developments [19].\nUsing the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM as an example, our goal is to test out a large variety of machine learning models and approaches to derive an optimal framework for building LLM-based PROMS. We will report on the performance and benefits of certain approaches to derive recommendations for LLM-based PROMS and determine an optimal configuration of the PROBot framework."}, {"title": "A. Proposed Framework", "content": "The proposed framework consists of the three main com-ponents Interpreter, Chatbot and Storage, as visualized in Figure 1. The Interpreter is responsible for understanding and analyzing patient responses. Based on the results of the Interpreter and data from the Storage component, the Chatbot generates appropriate messages for the dialog with patients. The Storage component provides the available patient data such as past conversations or various patient information. The Interpreter uses encoder LLMs to extract meaningful vector embeddings of patient responses and the Chatbot uses LLM Prompts and Prompt Engineering to generate high-qualitative and creative text messages. Both components rely on the strong capabilities of modern LLMs.\nThe Interpreter consists of an Encoder LLM that is used to extract meaningful embeddings for free-text formulations, fol-lowed by a machine-learning based Rater which derives output"}, {"title": "B. Data Collection and Evaluation", "content": "To ensure high quality for the chatbot text generation and interpretation of patient responses, large amounts of clean data need to be collected to fine-tune and evaluate task-specific large language models. A large corpus of patient surveys will be acquired, based on the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM and free text formulations. This data allows the training and comparison of many kinds of machine learning models with respect to the broadly accepted NEI-VFQ-25 PROM. Each participant will fill out the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM, which can then be used for target scores when training and evaluating ML models.\nThe participants are asked to write free text formulations in different formats. To ensure that the time required to complete the survey is reasonable, each participant will only complete one of the formats. Participants may be asked to respond to each individual PROM item with a free text, or to respond to a question for each PROM subscale with a free text. These formats are useful as they allow a direct mapping from the free text formulations to the target scores of the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM. Other formats such as writing a single large free-text formulation or using other scales such as 10 quality-of-life domains are also possible. However, these may be more difficult to map to the target scores of the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM. In this case, the participants will provide a score for each written free text, which can also be used as a target for the training and evaluation of models.\nThe collected data will be used to train ML models to learn the mapping from free-text responses to scores such as the individual PROM items or the PROM subscales. By collecting free-text responses for individual PROM items as well as for"}, {"title": "IV. QUALITATIVE RESULTS", "content": "To test the proposed chat generation approach, we have created a prototype for PRObot, which we call \"PROTObot\". In order to generate exemplary dialogues for an initial qual-itative analysis, we simulate synthetic patients using LLMs. In turns, responses are generated for PROTObot and the simulated patient using two separate instances of GPT-40. The PROTObot instance is assigned with asking the patient quality-of-life questions regarding their eyesight and address the patients responses to earlier questions with empathy. For this, the NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire is provided as reference material. The instance for the simulated patients is tasked with responding to the messages of the PROTObot instance, while following an LLM generated persona. The examples show that the simulation of patients results in the generation of exciting dialogues, which enables an initial evaluation of the proposed approach. One can see that PROTObot is able to generate individually suitable questions for the patients and react ap-propriately to the patient's responses. The generated questions are not just copied from the NEI-VFQ-25 PROM, but in most cases highly personalized questions that are tailored to each patient's available information.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK", "content": "We presented the outline for an AI-driven approach to improve the quality and usefulness of patient-reported outcome measures for diabetic retinopathy. Next steps involve conduct-ing a survey, as well as a clinical study to collect data for training and validation. On this basis, we want to further refine our approach and make it accessible to health care providers and patients.\nFurther development includes validating the ideas developed in this vision paper, i.e. training and evaluating ML models for the chatbot setup and the score prediction. If the approach proves successful for diabethic retinopathy, it could easily be extended to other chronic diseases and prevention use cases,"}]}

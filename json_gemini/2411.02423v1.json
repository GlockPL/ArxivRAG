Introduction", "content": "The surge of COVID-19 datasets encompasses diverse aspects including virology, symptoms, treatments, genomic sequences, and patient information (Dhama et al., 2020). This heterogeneous data presents challenges in making COVID-19 information comprehensible to both humans and machines, hampering comprehensive understanding and effective utilization for pandemic-related queries (Filip et al., 2022; Jean et al., 2020). Ontology has emerged as a pivotal approach for integrating and comprehending massive COVID-19 data, facilitating data integration, semantic interoperability, and advanced retrieval (Dutta, Nandini, et al., 2015). Various types and sources of datasets are available for COVID-19 information, such as websites, guidelines, gene banks, literature, and graphical data, each following heterogeneous formats (Dutta et al., 2022). Ontology-based approaches, exemplified by frameworks like CIDO (He et al., 2020, 2022), COVOC (Caucheteur et al., 2023), COVID-CRF-RAPID (Bonino, 2020), CODO (Dutta & DeBellis, 2020), ROC (Qundus et al., 2021), and CIDO-COVID-19 (Xiao et al., 2021), are gaining traction. However, our previous research highlighted that no single ontology comprehensively covers all essential dimensions of COVID-19 specific information or dataset (Bain & Dutta, 2023). Existing COVID-19 ontologies focus on specific aspects of the pandemic, lacking comprehensive coverage across critical dimensions. To address this gap, we have developed the integrated CODO model, encompassing key facets of COVID-19 information such as aetiology, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, genomics, and therapeutic safety. This paper provides a detailed review of recent updates to the COVID-19 Ontology (CODO). The objective is to provide recent developments and updates about CODO, serving as an ontological framework for aggregating and analysing diverse COVID-19 data, integrating"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Significant efforts have been made to develop ontologies that represent and organize knowledge and data related to COVID-19. These ontologies aim to structure and facilitate the use of the vast amount of information generated during the pandemic. Key contributions in this field include the COVID-19 Surveillance Ontology (de Lusignan et al., 2020), CIDO-COVID-19 (Xiao et al., 2021), COVIDCRFRAPID (Bonino, 2020), DRUGS4COVID19 (Badenes-Olmedo et al., 2020), ROC (Qundus et al., 2021), and CODO (Dutta & DeBellis, 2020), among others. COVID-19 Surveillance Ontology is designed to track COVID-19 cases and related respiratory illnesses. It utilizes data from electronic medical record systems to monitor the spread and impact of the virus, ensuring timely and accurate surveillance. Adhering to recommended ontology development criteria, CIDO-COVID-19 covers a broad range of aspects related to the disease. These include disease characteristics, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, symptoms, therapeutic interventions, and preventive measures. This comprehensive approach ensures a representation of COVID-19-related knowledge. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVIDCRFRAPID ontology serves as a data model for representing the WHO's COVID-19 RAPID case record forms. It provides a structured framework for capturing and querying detailed information from these forms, facilitating standardized data collection and analysis. DRUGS4COVID19 ontology details the relationships between medications and the COVID-19 virus. It includes categories such as drugs, their effects, related diseases, symptoms, and chemical substances, thus supporting research and development in the pharmacological domain. The ROC ontology evaluates governmental responses to the pandemic, focusing on both positive and adverse outcomes. This evaluation helps in understanding the effectiveness of various measures implemented to control the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact. Despite these significant contributions, a thorough review of 24 COVID-19 ontologies has revealed gaps in comprehensive coverage across various domains and dimensions of the pandemic (Bain & Dutta, 2023). These gaps underscore the need for an integrated model that can provide a more holistic view of COVID-19 data. In response to this need, our study introduces an integrated ontology model. This model aims to address the identified gaps by consolidating diverse COVID-19-related data into a unified framework.

Methodology", "content": "This section outlines the overall development approach and evaluation of our COVID-19 Ontology (CODO). Before delving into the methodology, we first discuss the evolution of CODO from its inception in 2020 to the present day."}, {"title": "3.1 Evolution of CODO: From 2020 to Present", "content": "The development of CODO began in response to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. As the severity of the outbreak became evident in early 2020, the need for a structured framework to manage the vast and complex data related to the virus was clear. The first author envisioned this necessity and, in collaboration with another researcher, produced the initial version of CODO 1.0\u00b9, which was detailed in an early publication (Dutta & DeBellis, 2020). Initially, the focus was on understanding the immediate data needs and complexities associated with COVID-19. As the pandemic progressed, the volume and complexity of datasets published increased significantly, prompting further development of the ontology. Early datasets included epidemiological data, clinical records, resource availability, genomic sequences, and public health information, revealing the multifaceted nature of COVID-19 data (Dutta et al., 2022). The initial development phase of CODO was iterative, involving continuous brainstorming, discussions, and refinements. The authors identified the need to expand the ontology's breadth and depth across various domains and facets of the pandemic. This iterative process led to the identification of gaps in existing ontologies and the need for a more comprehensive framework. One significant milestone in CODO's evolution was the publication of a paper identifying various domains and coverage areas specific to COVID-19 ontologies, highlighting existing lacunae and proposing a developmental approach (Bain & Dutta, 2023). This work laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of various dimensions and versions of CODO. For example, COVIDRO (COVID-19 Risk Ontology) was developed to address treatment challenges, patient risk factors, and drug interactions. Another significant version, COVID-19 Virus Genomics Ontology (CODO_VGO), enhanced the representation of genomic data, incorporating information on variants, mutations, genes, and proteins. The development of CODO has been an ongoing process, characterized by iterative improvements and expansions. Each version built upon the knowledge gained from previous iterations, incorporating new data and insights. The process involved extensive domain knowledge in virology, aetiology, and pathogenesis related to COVID-19. Currently, the development of CODO continues as the authors strive to identify new directions and accommodate unstructured COVID-19-specific information within the model.

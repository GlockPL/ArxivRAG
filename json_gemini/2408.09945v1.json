However, the increasing demand for high-quality translations that are not only adequate but also fluent and elegant. To assess the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands, we introduce a suitable benchmark for translating classical Chinese poetry into English. This task requires not only adequacy in translating culturally and historically significant content but also a strict adherence to linguistic fluency and poetic elegance. Our study reveals that existing LLMs fall short of this task. To address these issues, we propose RAT, a Retrieval-Augmented machine Translation method that enhances the translation process by incorporating knowledge related to classical poetry. Additionally, we propose an automatic evaluation metric based on GPT-4, which better assesses translation quality in terms of adequacy, fluency, and elegance, overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Our dataset and code will be made available.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The three difficulties in translation are: adequate, fluent, and elegant.\nYan, 1898\nThe emergence of large language models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, has demonstrated impressive performance in general translation tasks (Tyen et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2023; Guerreiro et al., 2023; Ranaldi et al., 2023). The extensive knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of these LLMs open new possibilities in the field of translation (Ouyang et al., 2022; Moslem et al.,"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Poetry Machine Translation The initial attempts at poetry machine translation utilized phrase-based machine translation systems to translate French poetry into metrical English poetry (Genzel et al., 2010). This study demonstrated how statistical machine translation systems can produce translations while adhering to the rhythmic and rhyming rules of poetry. Chakrabarty et al. (2021) conducted an empirical study that highlighted a critical but often overlooked issue: even though they can maintain meaning and fluency, advanced machine translation systems trained on large amounts of non-poetry data struggle to preserve the original style of poetry. To address the issue of style preservation, some studies have managed to generate diverse styles by inputting sentences with specific styles into the encoder and embedding the target style into the decoder (Zhang et al., 2018; Liu and Wang, 2012). Considering that poetry often contains richly stylized semantic information and deep historical and cultural connotations, such as in classical Chinese poetry, Rajesh Kumar Chakrawarti and Bansal (2022) proposed a Hybrid Machine Translation (HBMT) model to improve the semantic and syntactic accuracy of poetry translations. Recently, Wang et al. (2024) have successfully implemented translations of modern poems from English to Chinese using the knowledge and multilingual capabilities of ChatGPT.\nChinese Classical Poetry Dataset Chinese classical poetry has several open datasets. Chen et al. (2019) published the first fine-grained dataset, annotating a manually fine-grained emotional poetry corpus containing 5,000 Chinese quatrains. Yutong et al. (2020) released a dataset containing 3,940 quatrains with automatically annotated themes and 1,917 quatrains with automatically annotated emotions, using a template-based method. Additionally, Liu et al. (2020) collected a parallel bilingual dataset of ancient and modern Chinese and aligned the lines using a string matching algorithm. Based on these bilingual pairs, Li et al. (2021) constructed a matching dataset to evaluate models' semantic understanding capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset for English translation of Chinese classical poetry, aimed at evaluating the translation performance of current large models in terms of adequate, fluent, and elegant."}, {"title": "3 Classical Chinese Poetry Dataset Construction", "content": "In this section, we discuss the design and construction of the MT benchmark, including the rules and steps for building this benchmark."}, {"title": "3.1 Discourse-Level Poetry Translation", "content": "We collected a batch of classical Chinese poetry data and corresponding English translations from online resources. The classical Chinese poetry database contains 1200 poems from Tang Poems, Song Poems, and Yuan Opera. Then, We manually screened 608 classical Chinese poems and their corresponding translations to serve as gold standards for translation source and target alignment."}, {"title": "3.2 Adequacy in Sentence-Level Translation", "content": "To construct this test set, we selected sentences containing historical knowledge and commonsense from the collected data of classical Chinese poetry. To maintain the diversity of the test set, we avoided choosing semantically similar words and those that, despite having multiple meanings in Chinese, translate to the same word in English. We preferred to select words that translate to completely different English words in different contexts, requiring disambiguation based on understanding various contexts, historical backgrounds, writing styles, and commonsense. This test set consists of 500 sentences, with each translated sentence represented as a triplet (s, tc, te). As shown in Figure 2, s contains the source sentence with ambiguous words,  tc and te are the contrast translations, with the former being correct and the latter incorrect. The selected ambiguous words are used only once in each translated sentence."}, {"title": "3.3 Classical Chinese Poetry Knowledge Base", "content": "Classical Chinese Poetry holds rich historical and cultural nuances, but with limited resources for Classical Chinese, modern Chinese knowledge can greatly improve translation quality. We collected a Classical Chinese Poetry Knowledge Base using open-source projects and internet resources.

To mitigate this, we invite human annotators to assess the quality of translation parallel sentence pairs and eliminate any problematic instances."}, {"title": "4 Proposed Method: RAT", "content": "Translation of classical Chinese poetry requires un-derstanding of language style, cultural background, and author information. The RAT (Retrieval Augmented Translate) method was introduced to enhance translation outcomes by leveraging rich contextual information from the Classical Chinese Poetry Knowledge Base. We will now introduce the two workflows implemented in the RAT method in detail (in Figure 1). The first workflow (in Figure 1(a)) uses poetry as input and retrieves relevant knowledge about the poetry from the Classical Chinese Poetry Knowledge Base through text matching methods, obtaining different views of the relevant knowledge. The second workflow (in Figure 1(b)) translates based on the relevant knowledge from different views and integrates these to produce the final translation result."}, {"title": "4.1 The First Workflow", "content": "In the first workflow of RAT, there are two modules: Retriever and Selector. The Retriever is used to retrieve relevant knowledge from diverse perspectives based on the poetry, while the Selector filters the retrieved knowledge to enhance its relevance to the poetry.\n1. Retriever.

The Translator module translates different English verses based on classical Chinese poetry and the retrieved knowledge. The Voter module then votes on each translated sentence to determine the optimal translation. Finally, the Extractor module extracts the voted translation results to form the final translated version.\n1.Translator. The goal of the Translator is to translate different types of retrieved content. The LLM uses its translation capabilities to process both source content and retrieved content separately. This time, six types of related content were retrieved for classical Chinese poetry, resulting in six different translation outputs.\n2.Voter. The purpose of the Voter is to integrate translations based on different retrieval results to improve translation quality. As an agent of the LLM, Voter votes on each sentence of all translation outputs based on the source input, selects the highest-quality translations, and concatenates these selected sentences to form the final translation result."}, {"title": "5 Evaluation Methods", "content": "5.1 Evaluation Criteria\nThe translation of classical poetry requires not only artistic expression but also an understanding of the cultural background, making it nearly impossible to produce a single, universally correct translation. Therefore, multiple translations of the same classical poem can coexist, each offering a unique perspective and interpretation. Following this line of thought, we evaluate the quality of classical poetry translations through three aspects: adequate, fluent, and elegant. The specific evaluation methods are as follows:"}, {"title": "1. Adequate", "content": "(a) Accuracy (Acc)\u2020: Focus on the precision of each element in the translation, accurately translating historical, cultural, and factual aspects, including words and phrases, to maintain the correct semantic and logical relationships of the poem."}, {"title": "2.

This standard examines whether the translation achieves harmonious sound, precise wording, adherence to strict metrical rules, and a rhythm that is both smooth and dynamic.\n(b) Beauty of Form (BF)\u2191: Chinese classical poetry emphasizes balanced structure, with common forms such as four-character quatrains, seven-character quatrains, and seven-character regulated verse, each exhibiting distinct aesthetic characteristics of Chinese poetry. This standard evaluates whether the translation maintains consistency with the source poem's structure, including the alignment of line numbers and balanced phrasing."}, {"title": "3.

Drawing from current QE (Quality Estimation) research, we have developed an approach to utilize LLM in determining the quality of classical Chinese poetry translations. As shown in Figure 5, we designed a 1-5 scoring prompt to help LLM focus on the translation quality in terms of Beauty of Sound (LLM-BS). In the evaluation criteria, a score of 1 reflects a poor translation of classical Chinese poetry, a score of 3 indicates a basic but imperfect translation result and a score of 5 represents an excellent and accurate translation in this aspect. Subsequently, test data is provided to the LLM, and the LLM is asked to generate an assessment with scores only. Additionally, we calculate the average scores of BF, BF, and BM (LLM-Avg) to evaluate the overall translation performance."}, {"title": "5.3 Traditional Automatic Evaluation", "content": "In evaluating our translation methodology, we initially employ COMET\u00b9 (Rei et al., 2022) and BLEURT2 (Sellam et al., 2020b) as automatic metrics, aligning with the established standards in LLM-based translation literature (He et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024).

The analysis of the experimental results is as follows:\n\u2022 The task of translating Classical Chinese Poetry is challenging. The experiment shows that translating Classical Chinese Poetry is difficult, with low COMET/BLEURT/BLEU scores for current LLM-MT methods. This is because the translation is challenging and n-gram-based evaluation methods are not ideal for poetry. Additionally, GPT-4-based evaluation metrics, particularly in BS/BM/BF/AVG aspects, still need considerable improvement.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of RAT method. The proposed RAT method consistently outperforms other comparative methods across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of different LLMs. Among all comparative methods, closed-source models perform better on this task than open-source models, possibly implying that closed-source models benefit from richer pre-training data, thus enabling higher-quality translations. This also suggests that the Chinese Classical Poetry translation task is more challenging.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of retrieved knowledge. For EAPMT, which relies on LLMs' self-generated knowledge, the RAT method, which uses retrieval-based knowledge, provides more accurate information and further improves translation quality. This suggests that translating Chinese Classical Poetry demands stricter knowledge.

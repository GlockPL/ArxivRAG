The\ncomplexities of human experience, and competing ideas and understandings of well-being,\nare increasingly materialised through ever-growing sources of data. As reliance on these\ndata grows, they transcend being mere representations and become the primary source of\ntruth in understanding what it looks like to be human and to be well (Oman, 2021). Data\ntherefore have significant power, and exclusion from or misrepresentation in data results in\nexclusion and harm from the processes that use those data (Dalmer et al., 2024).\n\nDisabled people frequently experience just such exclusion and misrepresentation in data\nsystems. We focus on disability data, described by Aboulafia et al. (2024) as data 'collected\nand used to quantify and generate insights about people with disabilities,' and including also\nbroader data regarding a person's identity and experience of disability (Newman-Griffis et\nal., 2022).\n\nDisability data are contested and deeply political, and affected by structural ableism\nthroughout policy and health systems (Valdez and Swenor, 2023). National and population"}, {"title": null, "content": "surveys use competing definitions and measurement strategies, making their data a source\nof fierce debate and meaning that millions of disabled people quite literally do not 'count'\n(Hahn, 1993; Swenor and Landes, 2023). For individuals, conceptual, practical, and\ntechnological barriers lead to loss of disability data and create 'information inequities' in\nhealth and care data (Morris et al., 2022; Newman-Griffis et al., 2022). These data harms, in\nwhich vital aspects of experience, identity, and priorities are omitted or lost from data and\nthus from care systems, are often magnified by the use of artificial intelligence\nmethodologies to process and analyse disability data. The design of Al systems can further\nembed oppressive epistemologies of disability, such as medicalised definitions and\nexclusionary policies, whilst operating under the guise of algorithmic neutrality (Newman-\nGriffis et al., 2023; Weerts et al., 2024).\n\nHowever, disability injustice is not a foregone conclusion. Engaging with disability\ncommunities in rethinking disability data and data systems can help to foster disability data\njustice (Aboulafia et al., 2024; Swenor, 2022; Valdez et al., 2022). Designing new data and\nAl systems that are sensitive to disability data challenges can help to overcome information\nbarriers and develop more person-centred data (Newman-Griffis et al., 2022). As Thatcher\nand Dalton argue for spatial data (Thatcher and Dalton, 2022), we can reimagine\napproaches to disability-led data and data systems to help challenge structures of\noppression and explore new, emancipatory data and technologies for disability liberation.\n\nThis chapter presents visions of emancipatory disability data futures to move us towards\ndisability data justice and Al justice. We are four scholars, practitioners, and advocates\nworking at the intersection of disability, data, and Al. We have all experienced and critiqued\nthe limitations and the harms of current disability data and Al, but we embrace the potential\nof transformative futures to challenge the status quo and chart new paths for collective\naction on data and Al.\n\nWe approach these futures through the lens of social imaginaries (Taylor, 2002), a strategy\nfor exploring alternative social existences and the behaviours and collective notions that\nunderpin them. Social imaginaries have been used to explore and define new, desirable\nfutures in data and Al (Lehtiniemi and Ruckenstein, 2019; Rahm and Rahm-Sk\u00e5geby, 2023;\nSartori and Bocca, 2023). Imaginaries provide a valuable tool for imagining new data\nsystems free from and/or freely responding to the constraints of current practice.\n\nTo bring our perspectives together, we adopted the method of collective writing, a pioneering\napproach designed to engage with a multiplicity of perspectives and voices to reflect the\n'continuous struggle for meaning-making' (Jandri\u0107 et al., 2023). The \u2018diffractive writing'\nprocess this creates (Jarke and Bates, 2024), in which the harmonies and tensions between\ndifferent author contributions reflect the dynamic nature of collaborative research, aligns for\nus with the multiplicity and community-driven nature of disability discourses."}, {"title": "Reimagining records to reshape Al - Denis Newman-Griffis", "content": "Denis is a white, gender/queer, neurodivergent academic from a middle-class background.\nTheir work is situated in traditions of theory and practice from Al and data science, health\ninformatics, and disability studies."}, {"title": null, "content": "Artificial intelligence is both a prism and a megaphone. The use of Al refracts the many\ncharacters and histories embedded in data into discrete, filtered categories, while amplifying\nthe voices and perspectives that produced the data (Crawford and Paglen, 2021). Troubling\nthe role of Al in realising disability justice is in part a matter of troubling the data on which Al\ndepends and which it transforms. Few data are more troublesome of, and to, disability than\nthe medical record.\n\nThe medical record has long been a site of plural and competing epistemologies\n(Greenhalgh et al., 2009). On one level a record of fact to support the provision of timely,\nappropriate care, medical records also shape the practice of care itself, determining how\ncare is enacted and sustained (Halford et al., 2010; Isah and Bystr\u00f6m, 2020). The design\nand implementation of medical record systems is governed by financial pressures to account\nfor time and services, yet medical records become authoritative sources of medical\nknowledge (Koopman et al., 2022), and produce the single, stable truth of a patient's history\n(Berg and Bowker, 1997). Operating within this record, Al systems reify the infrastructure of\ncare and automate its efficiencies, reinforcing the production of sole medical truth by care\nprofessionals.\n\nIn contrast to the external, organising record, we imagine an alternative, multilateral health\nrecord co-created for dialogue and collaboration. Rather than a stable and temporally-\nunfolding history of fact, our imagined record operates as a dynamic space for reflecting and\ncollaboratively shaping the fundamentally unstable nature of disabled experience. This is a\nrecord of plural truths and lived multiplicity, including data that reflect an intertwined mixture\nof experiences, perspectives, priorities, and histories from not only patient and provider, but\nalso wider networks of interdependence. This collective and dynamic record thus\nmaterialises a more collaborative process and infrastructure of care, focused on collective\nresponse to lived experience and co-produced action towards disabled people's personal\npriorities.\n\nActing in this record, Al systems mediate through multiplicity: they are designed to help\norganise and bring together diverse perspectives and information from the record, and to\nmaintain the tensions between them rather than collapsing to a single, dominating\u2014and\nsynthetic-truth. Simultaneously, Al systems also facilitate the co-creation and maintenance\nof the record, through intentional interaction and recording (such as speech recognition and\nassisted writing) and ambient engagement with contextual information to situate recorded\ndata (through channels such as wearable devices and sensors). Al thus both mediates and\nfacilitates creating, accessing, and acting on the record, doing so in all directions within a\ncollaborative, agentic framework rather than unidirectionally imposing process and practice\nupon a passively receiving patient.\n\nThis new health record is not too distant to reach. The growth of personal health records,\ndynamic and evolving through multiple authorship and visibility in patient portals (Hawthorne\nand Richards, 2017), is laying the groundwork for a health record that can speak and\nadvocate with multiple histories. Al-assisted recording systems are becoming more\ncommonplace, reducing barriers to editing access to the record (Blackley et al., 2019; Lu et\nal., 2020). Turning these facilitators into tangible change requires taking a co-productive and\ndisability-led approach to redesigning the purposes and processes that the record"}, {"title": null, "content": "implements. Doing so will reshape the nature of medical history, and reimagine the Al\nsystems that act in and are shaped by the multiple stories of the health record."}, {"title": "Improving disability data is foundational to Al - Bonnielin Swenor", "content": "Bonnie is a white disabled woman whose research focuses on using data to advance equity\nand justice for people with disabilities."}, {"title": null, "content": "To identify and address Al bias impacting disabled people, we first need data to identify this\npopulation (Aboulafia et al., 2024). However, unaddressed and underlying data limitations\nprevent us from determining where and when Al disability bias occurs.\n\nCurrent methods used to collect data on disability or disability status have been shown to\nunderestimate disability prevalence. These measures miss many groups of disabled people,\nincluding but not limited to people with long COVID and other chronic conditions, as well as\npeople with psychiatric disabilities (Hall et al., 2022; Landes et al., 2024b; Schulz et al.,\n2024). Contemporary measures of disability primarily focus on assessing an individual's\nfunctioning, a separate but overlapping construct. However, not every disabled person\nexperiences functional limitations (Hall et al., 2022), and disabled people do not need to\nexperience functional limitations to be covered by disability civil rights protections in some\ncountries, such as the United States (Landes et al., 2024a). As a result, current measures of\ndisability misclassify disabled people as not having a disability, resulting in inaccurate\nestimates of disability prevalence. These data limitations also make it challenging to identify\ndisabled people within datasets, including disabled people from intersecting marginalised\ngroups, limiting our ability to identify and address algorithmic and Al biases impacting this\npopulation.\n\nAdditionally, disabled people are often excluded from datasets due to unaddressed barriers\nin the data collection process. For example, recent data indicate that out of thirty U.S.\nfederal, nationally representative surveys, none had protocols to make data collection\naccessible and inclusive of disabled people (Cerilli et al., 2024). These data underscore how\ndisabled people are excluded from datasets at every stage and level. Yet, few strategies or\ntoolkits focus on ensuring disabled people are included in data collection efforts. The\nexclusion of disabled people at the data collection level calls into question the\ngeneralizability and representativeness of datasets used to develop, test, and inform Al.\n\nRelatedly, the inaccessibility of data itself is problematic. Barriers to accessing, using, and\nunderstanding data exclude disabled people from accessing critical information, which, in\nturn, limits opportunities for disabled communities to identify and call out biases in data. In\npart, this stems from the historic exclusion of disabled people from data science. Yet,\naccessibility is everyone's responsibility. The barriers to data access stem from the lack of\nknowledge about accessibility and universal design across data and Al professions.\n\nDisability data justice principles (Swenor, 2022) can be used to redress the harms outlined\nabove and help maximise the potential of Al. Such an approach focuses on developing\nstrategies to address the historical exclusion of disabled people from data collection,\nanalysis, and dissemination. The foundation of disability data justice is ensuring disabled\npeople are part of all parts and phases of data-driven research and approaches, including"}, {"title": null, "content": "Al. However, disability data justice should not be limited to efforts focused on disabled\npeople or their data alone. Instead, there must be recognition that all issues are disability\nissues, and all Al efforts must work to uphold and advance disability data justice."}, {"title": "Synthesising cross-disciplinary methods for disability-inclusive Al\nRupa Valdez", "content": "Rupa is a chronically ill and disabled South Asian woman from a middle-class background\nwho lives in the United States.

One way\nto reimagine the ways in which Al is created and used is to synthesise the principles and\ntechniques of user centred design, human centred design, and community-based\nparticipatory research.\n\nStemming from the disability rights movement, universal design (UD) is an approach to\ndesign products, environments, and systems that are \u201cusable by all people, to the greatest\nextent possible, while minimising the need for adaptation or specialised design\" (North\nCarolina State University College of Design, n.d.). UD asks the designer to be guided by\nseven overarching principles: equitable use, flexible use, simple and intuitive use,\nperceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort, and size and space for\napproach and use. Ideally, these principles guide the design effort from the very beginning;\nbut may also be used to invite adaptation of tools and systems to expand usability. With its\nfocus on use, universal design gives us particular insight into ways to make interfaces to\nengage with Al more accessible to all. Extending universal access to conversations about Al\nalso leads us to reimagining ways in which Al may be explainable to all in ways that make\ncreative use of visualisations, plain language, and multi-modal resources.\n\nWhile universal design is a principle-driven design approach, human-centred design (HCD)\nis driven by engagement. HCD is guided by the belief that improving the usefulness and\nusability of products and services requires the active participation of its ultimate end users.\nAs such, HCD requires the designer to interact with users throughout all stages of the design\nprocess. Moreover, it requires designers to see such involvement as an iterative process in\nwhich feedback from users may require revisiting earlier stages of the design process.\n\nEngagement must explicitly include people who identify across physical, sensory, cognitive,\nand mental health disabilities and with those who hold a wide range of intersecting identities.\nIn addition to disabled people themselves, those in their social and care networks and\ncommunity-based organisations with a focus on disability rights and disability justice should\nbe involved. Techniques such as maximum variance sampling may be used to facilitate such\ninclusion (Benda et al., 2020). Approaches to engagement are ideally longitudinal and move\ntoward participatory design or co-design (Jolliff et al., 2023), but may begin with shorter-term\nengagements in the form of interviews, focus groups, surveys, and design workshops\n(Nadarzynski et al., 2024; Ozkaynak et al., 2021; Willis et al., 2023).

In addition to\nphilosophically centring community voices, CBPR pushes traditional approaches within\nuniversal design and HCD towards creating Al systems that are usable and useful (including\nsystems that do not perpetuate disparities) for disabled people, but also toward reimagining,\nfrom a disability community perspective, which types of problems Al should be used to\naddress.\n\nAlthough much work remains to be done to formally synthesise such approaches for Al, an\nearly approach to such synthesis, grounded in lessons learned from working with the\ndisability community, is articulated by Valdez et al.

A reimagined future in which people with disabilities are represented in the\nleadership and governance structures of the institutions developing, implementing,\noverseeing and regulating our systems disrupts the preconception that inclusive policy and\npractice is solely for end-users, participants or patients as passive recipients of support. This\nthinking is situated in a medical, charity or welfare model of disability (United Nations\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, 2022). The United Nations Convention on the\nRights of Persons with Disabilities insists that a human-rights model, where disability is\nembraced as a valued part of human diversity for all, is key to inclusive development.\n\nWhilst diversity, equity and inclusion policies and strategies are increasingly recognised as\ncrucial for the realisation of high-performing institutions that deliver impact (McKinsey &\nCompany, 2023), not all diversity is equally supported, valued or leveraged. Disability is still\noften left out of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives (Wright, 2022), and when it is\naddressed it is often in terms of meeting minimum access requirements only, rather than\npursuing true disability inclusion. In the absence of organisational support, disabled leaders\nthemselves are taking on much of the responsibility and burden to create access and\nopportunities for themselves as well as supporting next generations of disabled leaders\n(Disability Leadership Institute, 2017; Orkin, 2023).\n\nOrganisations that respond to these needs will have three key characteristics. First, they\nadopt strengths-based, disability-inclusive mindsets, learning from cultural models of\ndisability and inclusion that seek 'to improve the human condition through focussing on what"}, {"title": null, "content": "keeps people strong, as distinct to merely negating the adverse impact of difference' (First\nPeople's Disability Network Australia, 2024). Second, they uplift capability by putting their\npolicies into real practice, and adopting a continuous quality improvement mindset\n(Klinksiek, 2024; Singh and Meeks, 2023). Third, they intentionally cultivate the conditions\nfor disability justice, including organisational culture, adapting co-design methodologies from\nresearch to share power and reshape organisational practice (Fraser-Barbour et al., 2023).\n\nMore than culture, disability-inclusive organisations and governments must allocate tangible\nresources. In academia, reducing disparities for disabled faculty requires resources to\naddress ableism, create more inclusive environments, and raise standards beyond minimal\nregulatory compliance (Castro et al., 2024). Governments must lead by example, taking\nproactive action for inclusion beyond the blunt instrument of legislation, including shaping\ntheir own cultures and supporting broader cultural diversity and advocacy. There is much\nthat can be done by amplifying existing disabled leaders and putting material support behind\ntheir work, and as Sara Rotenberg argues, doing so is necessary to avoid 'perpetuating\ninequity or stalling necessary progress' (Rotenberg, 2021).\n\nReimagining our focus on leadership and organisational culture through a disability justice\nlens will help to shape a future in which accessibility is understood as an act of love (Mingus,\n2018), disability is a valued part of human diversity, and community-led participatory\nmethods are standard practice for achieving inclusion and working towards justice."}, {"title": "Concluding remarks", "content": "Achieving disability data justice, and building more just foundations for the intertwining of\ndisability and Al, requires action on multiple fronts.

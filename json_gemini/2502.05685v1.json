People are using mobile devices to\naccess and store important data on a regular basis. Users record\npersonal information such as names, address, phone number,\nand contacts [22]. In many mobile devices financial\ninformation is saved through applications or stored in browsing\nhistories. Critical passwords and usernames are readily\navailable to most users through mobile devices. Frequently,\nseemingly legitimate software applications, or apps, are\nmalicious; it is not complicated to develop apps for some of the\nmost popular mobile operating systems [12]. With information,\nmobile platform users are open to identity theft and account\nsecurity risks. Mobile devices have become a big target for\ncyber criminals [6]. Companies that allow personal devices on\ncorporate networks, 93 percent reported that when employees\nuse smartphones, tablets, or other devices to work with the\ncompanies' information, customer information is at risk [6].\nApplication developers sacrifice security to save on time and\neffort, bringing products to market quicker by concentrating on\nthe application's content [7]. The number of ne new\nvulnerabilities in mobile operating systems jumped 42 percent\nbetween 2009 and 2010 [12].\nMobile devices are now a pervasive part of everyday life in\nthe United States. On a daily basis, millions of Americans use\nthese devices to communicate and share information. Although\nmobile devices are quickly evolving due to technological\nbreakthroughs, they are still highly vulnerable to a number of\nsecurity attacks. According to the U.S. Government\nAccountability Office, security threats aimed at mobile devices\nhave risen significantly [13]. The study conducted by the GAO\nin 2012 has found that the number of malicious software\ntargeted at mobile devices increased from 14,000 to 40,000 in\nless than a year [13]. This issue is largely due to common\nvulnerabilities found in mobile applications.\nOne vulnerability found in mobile devices is the lack of\nsecurity software [5]. Most devices do not use any form of\nsecurity nor it comes preinstalled when purchased [5]. As a\nresult, there is no protection against malicious attacks and\nspyware applications. There is also no way for users to detect\nthese threats [5]. A common way for this is through harmful\nexploits that attack mobile devices through downloadable\napplications [5]. There are over 1 million applications available\nfor download in both the iOS [2] and Android market [3].\nConsumers can unknowingly download malware because it can\neffectively be disguised as a number of different applications\nsuch as a game, utility, security patch, and more [5]. Without\nany sort of security to detect a malicious application from one\nthat is secure, there is higher risk of a security breach. It is\nbecause of these security factors; cyber criminals can easily\naccess and steal user information without the user being aware.\nOversight by an application distributor can go a long way to\nensure user security in mobile application development [21].\nPenetration and other test methods are encouraged to identify\nsecurity risk [25]. It is crucial for quality developers to have\nprogramming practices to be put in place to mitigate future\nsecurity threats [21]. CompTIA realized the need for an\nindustry wide certification focused on security in mobile\napplication development [21]. The CompTIA Mobile App\nSecruity+ offers developers a certification in security\nawareness in mobile application programming [21]; however\nthis does not address the immediate security needs for\nconsumers."}, {"title": "SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION", "content": "Smartphones and tablets have been in wide use since the\nlate 2000s. The introduction of the iPhone and the HTC Dream\nin 2007 and 2008 respectively allowed early mobile users to\nhave the functionality of a computer in a compact hand carried\ndevice [16]. The iOS and Android operating systems made\nmobile computing a reality for the general population. The\npopularity of mobile computing caused cyber criminals to\ninvestigate ways of exploiting the new computing platform for\ncriminal gain. The first attempts at exploiting the mobile\ncomputing platform were the use of techniques that criminals\nleveraged to exploit traditional systems, such as desktop and\nlaptops that run Windows XP or Windows 7 [23]. Application\ndevelopment on both iOS and Android mobile devices created\na new avenue for cyber criminals to exploit to gain information\nand access to mobile operating systems. Applications for\nmobile devices have security vulnerabilities in place in the\ncode that the program is built from [8]. Some cyber criminals\nwill write programs that are meant to look and act as a harmless\nand useful application to encourage victims to download the\nprogram. After malicious programs are installed these\nprograms then send the sensitive information to the cyber-\ncriminal to be used for identity theft [4]. The newest cyber\nintrusion techniques to target mobile devices focus on\nmonitoring aspects of the phone that many experts consider to\nbe low security threats. These applications monitor memory\nallocation to figure out which sites the victims are visiting and\ngyroscopes and accelerometers to determine which characters\nare being used on a keyboard. The information can be used to\ngather sensitive information that the victim enters into the\nmobile device [24].\nMany mobile users are unaware of the threats that mobile\ndevices can pose to information security. Mobile device users\nneed be educated about measures that are necessary to keep the\ndevices and the information they contain secure [23]. Like\ntraditional systems mobile device security is always being\nchallenged by cyber criminals with new and evolved methods\nto get or modify the information held in the devices [24]. The\nSecurity risk is a hazard to personal information as well as\ncorporate information. Companies that have poor mobile\nsecurity practices are opening the business to possible theft and\ninformation loss through unsecure mobile device [4]. Many\ngovernment agencies have come to recognize the threat to\nsensitive information. These Agencies have either banned\nmobile devices or have allowed only agency acquired and\nmaintained mobile device to be used in the line of duty to\nprotect the information from being compromised [24].\nInstalling and deploying a security application on mobile\ndevices can provide various protections against ever increasing\nthreats. Several security applications have been developed to\nprovide protection for personal users as well as users of an\nenterprise environment, assisting administrators in corporate or\ngovernment environments. In the current market, some\nsolutions are developed as a multi-device solution, such as\nSymantec's Norton 360 that covers PCs, Macs and Android\nmobile devices [9]; while others focus specifically on mobile\ndevices with iOS and/or Android mobile operating systems in\nmind [11].\nNorton 360 offers protection for personal users and in\nrespect to mobile devices; it is only available for Android OS\n[9], while Fixmo's SafeWatch and Mocana's Mobile App\nProtection (MAP) suite is available for both iOS and Android\ndevices [10] [20]. Fixmo's SafeWatch is also geared more\ntowards the personal user but is available for enterprise\ndeployment [10], while Mocana's MAP solution is strictly\ngeared as an enterprise solution, allowing enterprise\nadministrators the ability to remotely administer iOS and\nAndroid devices, regardless if they are a 'bring your own\ndevice' (BYOD) or a company owned device [20]. Other\nnoteworthy differences between these security applications is\nSafeWatch's ability to transfer content between iOS and\nAndroid devices [10], MAP's ability to protect jailbroken iOS\ndevices through app wrapping [20], and Norton 360's ability to\nprovide parental controls [9]. For convenience, a more\ncomplete summary of features is provided in Table 1.\nThere have been many attempts to find a solution or at least\ndecrease the rising number of mobile security threats.\nHowever, these efforts need to be more effective as many of\nthem are unsuccessful or need great improvement. Google's\nBouncer, a security program introduced February of 2012, is an\nexample. Internet security company RiskIQ conducted a\nresearch which found a near 400% increase in the number of\nmalicious apps on Google Play from 2011 to 2013 [18]. In\norder to protect Android users from these threats, Bouncer was\ndesigned to quietly scan apps for suspicious behavior and\npossible threats during the uploading stage to the market.\nGoogle has reported that as a result, the Bouncer program was"}, {"title": "TEST CASE PROCEDURE", "content": "To demonstrate the need for security software/applications\non mobile devices a test installation of a known intrusive\napplication was conducted on two android based platforms\nwith a factory reset done between each install to ensure a clean\nenvironment. The first device tested was a first generation\nAmazon Kindle Fire. The Kindle Fire was equipped with the\nAndroid 2.3.3 Gingerbread operating system. The second\ndevice tested was the HTC One V Smartphone. The HTC One\nis equipped with the Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich\nOperating System. Neither device came with any security\napplications preloaded to protect the devices. The application\nused to infect the devices in both the unprotected and protected\nstages was call Hungry Dino. This application could be found\non both the Google Play store and the Amazon App store. The\nfirst security software that is used in the secure phase of testing\nis Trend Micro Maximum Security Titanium. Trend micro\nproducts are common off-the-shelf computer and mobile\nsecurity software. The second security software that was used\nin the secure phase of testing was the Dr. Web application. The\nDr. Web application can be found on both the Google Play\nstore and the Amazon App Store. Each device was set to a\nfactory state between each test to ensure that there were no\nextenuating circumstances that would affect results of the\ntesting."}, {"title": "TEST CASE RESULTS", "content": "The first test observed the document reader application on\nthe Amazon Kindle Fire with the Wi-Fi connection activated\nin the factory reset state. In this test 20 pages were navigated\nthrough in a 15 second time period. The HTC One V browser\nwas activated in the factory reset state. In this test 5 pages of\nthe walmart.com website were navigated in a 15 second\nperiod. This set of testing allowed for a baseline of normal\noperation under factory settings for both devices. In the second\nround of testing the factory reset of both devices, The Hungry\nDino application was downloaded and installed on both\ndevices. The internet connection was activated on both devices\nand the function testing for each device was administered the\nsame way as the previous round of testing. In the second test\nthe Amazon Kindle Fire lagged significantly in the reader test.\nThe 20 page navigation took 40 seconds to complete because\nthe Hungry Dino Application was using the CPU, RAM, and\nWi-Fi connection to gather device information and send it to\nan outside source. On the HTC One V walmart.com 5 page\nsite navigations took 5 minute to complete because the Hungry\nDino application was utilizing the cell data connection, RAM,\nand CPU to collect and send device information to an outside\nsource. The third round of testing both devices were reset to\nfactory setting and The Dr. Web security application was\ndownloaded installed and updated on both devices. The\nHungry Dino application was then downloaded and installed\non both devices. The Dr. Web application then scanned the\nHungry Dino application and recognized the malicious code in\nthe application and activated a warning to remove the Hungry\nDino application. The remove application button was selected\nand the Hungry Dino application was deleted from the\ndevices. The Amazon Kindle Fire reader test was 17 seconds\nto navigate the 20 page for this round of testing. The HTC One\nV navigated the 5 walmart.com pages in 16 seconds for this\nround of testing. In the fourth round of testing both devices\nwere reset to factory settings. The Hungry Dino application\nwas then downloaded and installed on each device. Then\nTrend Micro Internet Security was applied to each device and\nupdated. The reader test was conducted on the Kindle Fire\nwith a time of 45 second to navigate the 20 pages recorded.\nThe website navigation test on the HTC One showed a time of\n4 minutes 20 seconds. After these tests the security scan in the\nTrend Micro software was run on each device. During the scan\nthe security software identified and removed the Hungry Dino\napplication. The reader test was performed on the Kindle Fire\nwith a time of 15 seconds for the 20 pages. The web browsing\ntest was performed on the HTC One with a time of 20 seconds\nfor the 5 pages.\nThe results of the testing showed just how easy it is to\naccidently download and install a malicious program that can\ngo about its tasks with little to no knowledge of the mobile\nuser without close monitoring of the lag the mobile user might\nnot realize that the malicious application is working in the\nbackground. The installation of security applications on the\nmobile devices recognized the malicious applications either\nimmediately after installation or after the first security scan.\nUnlike traditional desktop and notebook computers mobile\ndevices rarely have built in security measures to protect the\nsystem leaving them vulnerable to malicious software. These\ntest demonstrated the need for mobile security and the\nimportance of mobile security education for all mobile users."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "The purpose of the study was to make the reader aware of\nthe security vulnerabilities of mobile devices. The research has\nshown that mobile devices are not equipped with standard\nsecurity software. Mobile users that fail to take proper\nprecautions, such as installing security applications, can\nunknowingly install malicious programs on their mobile\ndevices and be subjected to theft of information or device\nperformance degradation. Without proper security software\nthe malicious programs can easily go undetected. Quite often\nperformance degradations are discounted as software glitches\nor Internet connectivity problems. The applications tested in\nthis case identified the malicious programs during install or\nafter the first security scan when properly updated.\nThis study is meant to show the vulnerabilities inherent in\nmany mobile devices in order to educate users to real security\nthreats that many mobile users either ignore or are unaware of.\nEducating the average mobile device user is the first step to\npreventing security problems in mobile devices. With this\nawareness mobile users can take precautions to ensure the\nsafety of information that is held on mobile platforms, by\ninstalling security applications to detect threats from malicious\napplications.\nThe research shows that security applications need to be\nintegrated into mobile systems during the development period.\nThe mobile device industry standards for device security\nshould be raised to ensure that mobile users are protected from\ncyber-criminals and the software they use to carry out their\ncriminal activities. Installing a security scan application onto\neach mobile device would make mobile users aware of\nmalicious applications acquired when downloading\napplications. Information security needs to be taken more\nseriously by mobile device users and mobile device\nmanufacturers."}]}

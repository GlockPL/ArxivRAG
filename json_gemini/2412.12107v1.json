The competencies range from foundational AI literacy to prompt engineering and programming skills, including ethical and legal considerations. These twelve competencies offer a framework for individuals, policymakers, government officials, and educators looking to navigate and take advantage of the potential of generative AI responsibly. Embedding these competencies into educational programs and professional training initiatives can equip individuals to become responsible and informed users and creators of generative AI. The competencies follow a logical progression and serve as a roadmap for individuals seeking to get familiar with generative AI and for researchers and policymakers to develop assessments, educational programs, guidelines, and regulations.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems across all domains, the concept of AI literacy (\"a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies\" [61]) has become increasingly important and necessary in the past few years. The legislative work on the European AI Act [32] done by the European Parliament and European Commission has also contributed to increasing attention towards the risks and challenges posed by systems and tools based on Al models, as well as viable ways to regulate them [41, 42].\nGenerative models have found applications across many sectors, reflecting their adaptability and potential impact [58, 78, 81]. As governments worldwide increasingly digitalize their operations and services, there is a growing intersection between Al and governance. Generative AI technologies can transform communication, public engagement, and decision-making processes with and within governmental bodies [13]. Understanding the implications, challenges, and opportunities presented by generative AI is vital for researchers and practitioners in the field of digital government to make informed decisions about its usage and adoption. At the same time, a literate workforce is better equipped to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring that the deployment of generative AI in government processes is accompanied by risk assessment and mitigation strategies. With the transformation of the digital government arena, generative Al literacy is essential for future-proofing government operations. Professionals who understand generative Al can proactively adapt to emerging technologies, ensuring sustained relevance and effectiveness of digital government initiatives.\nThe concept of Al literacy has also emerged as a fundamental set of competencies to have during the AI era. However, the recent explosion of generative AI, spearheaded by ChatGPT, the Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, has created the need for a more definite set of skills, abilities, and knowledge, specific to the scope and applications of generative AI. The need for specific generative Al literacy arises from the following factors. First, the functionality to generate new text, images, music, videos, and code requires a distinct understanding of what generative AI can and cannot do compared to other existing AI tools. Second, generative Al's transdisciplinarity has implications for various fields, such as writing, design, and scientific research [78]. Thus, an awareness of how these systems operate to produce output that meets certain criteria, coherence, and creativity is needed. In the third place, the outputs of generative Al raise critical questions on authorship, ownership, and originality. Thus, understanding generative AI involves not just the technical aspects of the algorithms or tool utilization but also bringing significant attention to the ethical and practical considerations in its use. Finally, generative AI tools are increasingly becoming accessible and user-friendly, necessitating additional aspects of AI literacy for the general public, not just for people specialized in technology.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a competency-based model that can delineate a general concept of generative Al literacy, in which the model can be used as a framework to assess the ability of users to understand, interact with, and create generative AI models. This paper aims to fill a gap at the intersection of the topics of AI literacy and generative AI, as no set of competencies specific to the use of generative Al had been previously proposed.\nThe twelve competencies identified in this paper can be intended as a complement to the existing framework on AI literacy, providing additional guidance on the specific toolbox that a user of generative AI tools needs. This concept of generative Al literacy is associated with that of prompt engineering, which is the ability to design effective prompts for generative Al models to produce desired outputs [79]. However, while prompt engineering is one of the competencies and is crucial for generative Al literacy, the proposed model goes well beyond it and the more technical features of generative AI, and considers the contextual and situational aspects. This work can therefore serve as a starting point for future research on the applications of generative AI and its adoption in public government, institutions, and organizations.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows: after explaining the methodology in Section 2, Section 3 gives an overview of existing literature concerning the concepts of AI literacy and generative AI, as well as laying the theoretical framework of a competency model. Section 4 proceeds to show an overview of the 12 competencies. Section 5 includes detailed descriptions of each competency, providing illustrative examples. Section 6 discusses the benefits and shortcomings of this proposed competency model, together with potential applications and ideas for future research. Section 7 presents our conclusions."}, {"title": "2 METHODOLOGY", "content": "To begin this work, a preliminary database search was conducted in order to identify the state of the art on generative Al literacy. Five scientific databases, specifically ACM Digital Library\u00b9, IEEExplore\u00b2, Clarivate Web of Science\u00b3, Scopus, and Dimensions, were searched with the specific query \u201cgenerative AI literacy\u201d OR \u201cgenerative artificial intelligence literacy\". Given the low amount of results (6 records in total, as described in Section 3.1), all the articles are described in Table 1. The scarcity of results highlighted the novelty of the concept and the current gap in academic literature. Consequently, given the novelty of the topic, a long-standing review approach on generative AI literacy is not feasible at this moment, and instead, a non-systematic, comprehensive literature review was carried out on studies written in English, including seminal papers and systematic reviews on the following topic areas:\n\u2022 Al literacy\n\u2022 Systematic reviews on the applications of generative Al\n\u2022 Prompt engineering\n\u2022 Competency models\nFollowing the database search and literature review, we identified a list of competencies that can help define the concept of generative Al literacy, covering different aspects that emerged from the literature. The findings are summarized in Section 4, which also includes some speculative potential implications of having acquired (or not) the competencies. Given the novelty of the topic, a speculative approach was chosen for discussing potential implications, relying on informed opinions and current trends due to the scarcity of previous research on this specific issue.\nEach of the competencies is then described in detail, and provided with an illustrative example. These descriptions are included in Section 5."}, {"title": "3 LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Several studies in recent years have explored the concept of AI Literacy [67, 105], and a number of systematic reviews have been published on the topic [15, 61, 67]. An often-cited definition of Al literacy is given by Long and Magerko [61] as \"a set of competencies that enables individuals to critically evaluate AI technologies; communicate and collaborate effectively with AI; and use AI as a tool online, at home, and in the workplace\" [61]. The authors also provide a list of 16 core competencies that form the basis of AI literacy, as well as a set of design considerations that should help design readily accessible AI tools.\nNonetheless, as also indicated by the preliminary database search, comparatively few studies explore the concept of Al literacy in the specific context of generative AI [51]. This is particularly relevant as, on the other hand, there has been a surge in the scholarly literature concerning generative AI, i.e., the deep-learning models aimed at generating original content that aims at simulating human-made content. Specifically, these models include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [24], Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [48], and autoregressive models, such as transformers [101], along with others. In particular, the emergence of ChatGPT, together with its capabilities and wide range of applications, has led to great media and scientific attention towards this model and LLMs in general [78, 103]. Multiple systematic reviews have been published on the topic [78, 81], analyzing and discussing the impacts of ChatGPT and generative Al in general on different areas including education [6, 47, 49, 58, 72, 81, 88], healthcare [4, 52, 56, 92, 93], research [77, 80, 88], and society [7], among others.\nHence, the academic interest in ChatGPT, LLMs, and generative AI, in general, has been soaring, but at the same time, more research questions arise and need to be addressed [29, 94]. Despite this, the concept of AI literacy has not evolved, and existing frameworks do not differentiate between generative and predictive models [61, 62]."}, {"title": "3.1 Preliminary Database Search", "content": "As explained in Section 2, an initial database search was conducted in December 2023, using the specific strings \"generative Al literacy\" or \"generative artificial intelligence literacy\".

The table includes a short summary of the contents of each of the studies and a description of how the concept is defined.\nAs observed from Table 1, there is not a well-established concept of generative Al literacy in the current academic literature. The few existing papers tend to conflate it with the more general and better-established concept of Al literacy."}, {"title": "3.2 Al literacy and generative Al", "content": "Several studies in recent years have explored the concept of AI Literacy [67, 105], and a number of systematic reviews have been published on the topic [15, 61, 67].

Succar et al. [91] proposed a Triple-A competency model that emphasizes the importance of acquiring, applying, and assessing competencies. Possessing competencies often carries positive implications and can, in principle, be assessed [85]. From an organizational perspective, competencies can be organized into a competency model, which Chouhan and Srivastava [22] define as \u201ca valid, observable, and measurable list of knowledge, skills, and attributes that are demonstrated through behavior to achieve exceptional performance in a specific work setting.\u201d\nCompetencies are conceptualized to be applied in practice, being useful in specific contexts [102]. It is also important to take into account that acquiring a competency is a process, which is not unique given the huge diversity of contexts in which users are acquiring it [9, 44]. In this sense, this paper adopts the definition given by the National Institute of Health (NIH), according to which \"Competencies are: Knowledge (Information developed or learned through experience, study, or investigation), Skills (The result of repeatedly applying knowledge or ability); Abilities (An innate potential to perform mental and physical actions or tasks); Behaviors (The observable reaction of an individual to a certain situation)\" [70]."}, {"title": "3.4 Need for a Generative Al Literacy competency model", "content": "While previous studies have explored Al literacy in various contexts and investigated the capabilities and limitations of generative Al models, the database search showed the absence of literature defining the concept of generative AI literacy and also a comprehensive framework that systematically addresses competency acquisition in navigating and utilizing generative AI tools."}, {"title": "4 A COMPETENCY-BASED MODEL FOR GENERATIVE AI LITERACY", "content": "As previously mentioned, the rapid rise of generative AI tools and their widespread adoption in various disciplines have created a unique set of skills specific to these novel tools, which go beyond the traditional competencies associated with data literacy, digital literacy, or AI literacy. This paper aims to identify a set of competencies that are necessary for users to develop to effectively comprehend and utilize generative tools. This paper adopts the aforementioned definition of competency given by the National Institute of Health, which groups competencies into knowledge, skills, abilities, or behaviors [70]. Alongside, this paper defines generative Al literacy as a long-term, continuous process by which several core competencies, allowing to effectively and responsibly understand, assess, and work with generative AI technologies, have been identified, acquired, practiced, and mastered.\nBased on existing literature on AI literacy, digital literacy, prompt engineering, generative AI, and related topics, including surveys and reviews, peer-reviewed publications, gray literature, and books, this work identifies twelve specific competencies to define the concept of generative Al literacy acknowledging the varied nature of engaging with generative AI.\nAs illustrated by Figure 1, the ordering of these competencies is purposeful and follows a logical progression to represent a structured learning path reflecting a continuum of learning, as continuous self-learning is transversal to all the other capabilities. The initial focus is on creating the general basis of knowledge and skill to know and use generative Al tools, followed by knowing how to detect Al-generated content. These develop into more technical skills related to the use of generative AI, with content assessment, prompt engineering, and programming. Then, the three interrelated competencies regarding the knowledge of the contexts, ethical implication, and legal aspects, are intentionally placed towards the end to underline their significance. This approach allows individuals to progressively acquire skills and knowledge, encouraging a user-centric learning experience.\nAll the competencies of this Competency-Based Model for generative Al literacy are outlined in Table 3, with a more detailed explanation in Section 5. Table 3 includes examples of the positive implications of being proficient with each capability, as well as the negative implications of not acquiring the specific competency. As mentioned in Section 2, these"}, {"title": "5 GENERATIVE AI COMPETENCIES", "content": "This section describes each of the twelve competencies defined in the previous section in detail and provides an example of what an individual can do by acquiring that competency."}, {"title": "5.1 Basic Al Literacy", "content": "First and foremost, any framework for generative AI literacy should comprise more general Al literacy competencies and skills. Indeed, the knowledge and understanding of generative tools is in large part conditional to a familiarity with Al systems. Similarly, to assess a user's ability to understand, use, and evaluate generative tools, it is essential to consider their expertise regarding the broader area of AI software.\nAs noted, Al literacy does not equate to computing literacy, nor is computing literacy necessary for Al literacy, as individuals may recognize, learn about, and use Al without necessarily being able to program or having experience in computer science and engineering [61].\nExample: Individuals will be able to recognize different types of AI. This will enable them to evaluate the potential benefits and risks, understanding how AI can impact them or their business processes."}, {"title": "5.2 Knowledge of generative Al models", "content": "The first competency relating to generative Al pertains to specific knowledge of what it is. Growing media attention on generative models, specifically LLMs, has raised general awareness of AI. However, it has also led to increased confusion surrounding Al's true nature [53].\nWithin the scope of the competency-based model for generative AI literacy, knowledge, and understanding of this concept can be defined as a competency with different levels of depth. It is primarily relevant to assess whether an individual has heard of generative Al or some examples of it, such as ChatGPT. Then, individuals should know how it works at a high level, in particular, that it is a statistical model, that it is trained on big data, and that it can generate different types of output. Users should also understand the differences between the user interface and the model itself, and that it is fundamentally different from a search engine, as it generates original content rather than retrieving existing one.\nExample: Despite the extensive media coverage, ChatGPT lacks widespread recognition among diverse demographics, particularly among certain age groups and professions. Even among those who have heard of it, usage remains limited [71]."}, {"title": "5.3 Knowledge of the capacity and limitations of generative Al tools", "content": "Besides knowing what generative AI models are, users should also understand what they can do, including their potential and limitations. The increasing media presence of generative AI and AI-generated content has started to raise concern regarding the current and future capabilities of AI, increasing the worry that Al systems can be dangerous and used against the public good [19, 20]. It is, therefore, relevant that users are aware of the actual limitations as well as capabilities of generative AI, with their advantages, strengths, weaknesses, and potential harms. Moreover, it is beneficial to be able to recognize and understand patterns in generative AI and AI-generated content, identifying the main attributes of the models.\nAmong the challenges posed by generative AI, users should be aware of privacy and security concerns, especially concerning personal information fed as input into the existing services, and impersonation and identity theft that can be facilitated by deep fakes. Another threat is posed by the potential misuse of technology as a technique to deceive people, including the fabrication of videos, audio, images, and text, for purposes that can span from phishing attacks to social engineering.\nExample: The output of ChatGPT and other LLMs can often contain a mixture of facts and completely false and fabricated statements, and awareness of this is fundamental [1, 5]."}, {"title": "5.4 Skill to use generative Al tools", "content": "In terms of the competency-based model for generative Al literacy, a valuable skill for users is to learn how different generative tools work, and how to interact with new emerging generative models. This includes expertise in a specific model, the knowledge of different existing models tailored to specific needs, as well as the ability to easily learn and use new tools depending on need.\nThe plethora of existing tools based on generative AI models has brought the need to be aware of the diversity of the existing generative tools and what they can do, as well as the modality and specificities of each one of them. Hence, a very valuable competency is to know which tool to use for a specific application, and how to use it to generate new content. This skill can be defined as somewhat technical, as it implies practicing the use of models, and can be easily improved with courses targeted to specific toolsets. Indeed, this has become a noteworthy skill to have in the labor market, as increasingly more companies require employees who can use and master generative AI [14, 31]."}, {"title": "5.5 Ability to detect Al-generated content", "content": "With the advance of generative AI, it has become increasingly difficult to discern which contents have been entirely human-generated, AI-generated, or AI-enhanced [29]. Hence, this competency concerns both being able to tell apart human-made from AI-made content, and knowing how to use AI detection software. Guidelines and techniques to help users identify which images, videos, and text have been created by AI [39] are already being discussed. However, human detection of AI-generated photos and texts becomes increasingly difficult [68], making AI detectors always more significant. In recent years, there has been a surge in software and AI models to detect AI-generated content, both text (such as ZeroGPT, GPTZero, PlagiarismCheck, GPT Radar, Writer.com, among others) [18, 66, 97], images (AI or Not or Is it AI?) and videos [45, 75].\nAt the same time, it is noteworthy that this task is becoming increasingly difficult, and individuals should ideally be aware of state-of-the-art tools to try to optimize their probability to correctly distinguish AI-generated from human content [8, 33, 35]. In this sense, some of these detectors tend to overestimate the probability that a text, image, or video is Al-generated, while others underestimate it, and there is often a great divergence in results across different AI detection tools [97]. Hence, users should be aware of the biases of the detectors they use, and possibly use a combination of them to verify the content.\nExample: When seeing a video that looks questionable, people should be able to verify, through AI detectors and official sources, whether the video is authentic or fabricated. A recent example from 2023 is the case of a viral Al-generated video of the Pentagon on fire, which created some panic [23, 38]."}, {"title": "5.6 Ability to assess the output of generative Al tools", "content": "After the users manage to generate output with generative tools, they should also be able to carry out a thorough assessment of it, in order to use it in a way that corresponds to their needs and expectations. This includes a verification of the content of the output with the aid of trusted sources, so to prevent or minimize the effect of model hallucinations [1, 3, 5]. Critical thinking is paramount in this task, as users should be able to only select the content that is the most useful to them, discerning what information and format they should use, and how to adapt it for their desired applications.\nThis competency is related to prompt engineering (the skill to effectively prompt generative Al models) and can be seen as being somewhat propaedeutic to it. Indeed, most prompt engineering techniques include an assessment of the output, but this does not necessarily imply that the user is fully proficient in prompt engineering.\nExample: Individuals using LLMs to write essays on specific topics should check the facts presented in the output, to verify that they are not hallucinations of the model, and present these facts in a way that corresponds to their needs."}, {"title": "5.7 Skill in prompting generative Al tools (Prompt Engineering)", "content": "One of the main competencies specific to the use of generative AI is that of prompt engineering, specifically a set of techniques and methods to write prompts as inputs of text-based generative models [79]. Different sets of guidelines have been written on prompt engineering for ChatGPT and LLMs, highlighting its importance [2, 34, 87, 100]. It is important to note that prompt engineering is not limited to LLMs, but to all types of generative AI that use text as input, including text-to-image models, as evidenced by the existing literature and guidelines for text-to-image prompt engineering [57, 108]. Prompt engineering consists of a broad skill set, with different methods that allow to effectively interact with generative models [82]. A number of techniques have emerged for this purpose, including automatically generated prompts [86], Chain of Thoughts prompting [50, 98, 107] and Tree of Thoughts prompting [62, 104]. Multimodal prompting, including images and other formats as input, has also emerged and increased in popularity [76]\nWhile it is beyond the scope of this paper to delve into the details of prompt engineering, given the abundance of academic writings and systematic reviews of the topic [21, 36, 55], being aware of different techniques to optimally prompt Al systems can allow users to be more efficient in their use of generative AI.\nMost generative models that are deployed at the time, whether they are LLMs, text-to-speech, or text-to-image, rely on certain hyperparameters that can be adjusted by the users. In the case of ChatGPT, for example, these include the temperature, which determines the \u201ccreativity\" of the model, the maximum number of tokens to be used, and the $top\\_k$ and $top\\_p$ to limit the number of next word choices of the model and the probability of the next word choices, respectively [60, 83]. Hence, fixing these parameters is an additional and more advanced skill to know when mastering prompt engineering.\nExample: In the context of image generation, the utilization of descriptive language, understanding the trade-offs between creativity and specificity, the possibility of segmenting longer prompts into smaller units, or the incorporation of negative words, can all lead to outputs that are different from the conventional results [74]."}, {"title": "5.8 Ability to program and fine-tune", "content": "The most high-level technical competency consists of more programming-related skills with respect to the development of generative Al models. These include the design of new models and architectures, proficiency in the use of common libraries for deep learning, and being able to adapt existing generative models and fine-tuning them to specific applications. People competent with this ability should be able to select appropriate models and adapt their architecture to the circumstances, select and prepare the training data, and know how to implement, train, test, and deploy a model.\nMost users will neither have nor need this ability for their specific goals, and still be literate on generative Al without it.\nExample: This ability is valuable for developing generative AI in specialized domains such as medical writing or dealing with languages other than English. Developers can adapt these models to equip them with a deeper understanding of domain-specific vocabulary and intricacies, leading to more impactful and tailored content generation or for particular linguistic nuances, cultural references, and colloquialisms."}, {"title": "5.9 Knowledge of the contexts where generative Al is used", "content": "Given the apparent universality of artificially generated content, users should be able to evaluate which are the appropriate contexts to use it, in which modalities, and to which extent. This requires a level of adaptation to the environmental expectations and requirements with respect to the tools and content to be used.\nThis competency is related to the next two, as both the legal framework and ethical values and principles influence the context where generative AI can be used. Nonetheless, this competency differs from them as it relates more closely to the specific applications of generative AI, which may vary from case to case; moreover, while the ethical and legal contexts are important, the user should also consider the social and professional context, which may determine to what extent it is appropriate and useful to use generative Al for given scenarios.\nGenerative Al had a disruptive impact on different domains, and not all authorities and organizations have had the time to adapt to it by developing guidelines and rules, as in the case of the scientific and academic world [89, 90]. While this is likely to change in the near future, users should in any case be able to use their discretion to adapt their use of generative AI to different circumstances.\nExample: Several universities have developed guidelines for the use of LLMs in assignments [26]. This differs from campus to campus, with some of them prohibiting LLMs altogether, and others allowing them for certain types of coursework. Students should learn these guidelines, and behave accordingly."}, {"title": "5.10 Knowledge of the Ethical Implications", "content": "It is important to critically analyze both generative AI models and their outputs from a human perspective, considering how they interact with the world and society. In other words, this competency is about construing generative AI as a human artifact, and how it operates from a societal point of view. With this respect, users should learn how to align their use of generative AI with their ethical values, understanding the possible ethical implications both of the models and their outputs.\nEthical aspects should be taken into consideration in all stages of the use of generative AI: when programming and deploying it, when designing guidelines to regulate its use, and when using it and employing it for specific use-cases [54].\nExample: A campaign manager showing an AI-generated image without making it explicit may induce voters to think that they are seeing a true photo rather than a fabricated one. This may mislead the public during an election, and while it may not necessarily be illegal, its ethical implications should be analyzed and considered. An example of such a scenario occurred during the campaign for Switzerland's 2023 elections [99]."}, {"title": "5.11 Knowledge of Legal Aspects", "content": "While at the time of writing this paper, only a few countries have begun a legislative process regulating AI and its applications, it is likely that several others will follow [37, 65]. Indeed, in March 2024 the European Parliament approved the European AI Act [32], determining a set of norms to be followed with respect to several aspects of Al at large [41, 42, 63]. At the same time, several states from the United States have begun to adopt laws targeting specific aspects of AI [17], and in 2023 President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14110 on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence [40].\nUsers should be generally aware of the legal framework concerning Al in general and generative AI specifically, to know to what extent they can legally use generative AI, as well as to understand their rights and the guarantees that they have by law.\nExample: The most prominent example of AI legislation to date is the European AI Act [32], and European users should become familiar with it and its implications."}, {"title": "5.12 Ability to continuously learn", "content": "While this ability is not limited to generative Al and can be extended to other domains, the high dynamism of the field of generative AI imposes the necessity for users to be able to constantly learn new tools, functionalities, issues, and regulations that may arise. This is a transversal competency, that applies to each of the other ones, which should be regularly updated. While this skill may appear to be trivial, it is important to make it explicit so as to highlight the agency of the individual.\nExample: A user of video generative AI should keep up with the updates of the tools that they use, and be aware in case new tools become available."}, {"title": "6 DISCUSSION", "content": "The presented competencies for generative Al literacy gather prominence with the increasing pervasiveness of generative Al technologies, exerting a deep impact on both individuals and society at large.

As part of organizations, individuals already use (or can use) generative AI applications for tasks such as note-taking, summarization, time management, and providing faster support to common queries [12]. In addition to its role in supporting policy development and regulation, generative AI has the potential to ease access to internal knowledge and databases through chat and also provide answers to frequently asked questions by citizens [28].\nUnderstanding how generative Al will be employed by government personnel is essential for comprehensively addressing the implications of AI adoption in the public sector and shaping future governance models.

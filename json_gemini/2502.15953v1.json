The complete drying up of a lake has caused\na community environmental catastrophe. In this study, we presented an optimization\nproblem to determine the total surface runoff to maintain the level of salinity lake (Urmia\nLake). The proposed process has two key stages: identifying the influential factors in\ndetermining the lake water level using sensitivity analysis approaches based upon\nhistorical data and optimizing the effective variable to stabilize the lake water level under\nchanging design variables. Based upon the Sobol'-Jansen and Morris techniques, the\ngroundwater level and total surface runoff flow are highly effective with nonlinear and\ninteracting impacts of the lake water level. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, we found\nthat it may be possible to effectively manage lake levels by adjusting total surface runoff.\nWe used genetic algorithms, non-linear optimization, and pattern search techniques to\nsolve the optimization problem. Furthermore, the lake level constraint is established\nbased on a pattern as a constant number every month. In order to maintain a consistent\npattern of lake levels, it is necessary to increase surface runoff by approximately 8.7 times\nduring filling season. It is necessary to increase this quantity by 33.5 times during the\ndraining season. In the future, the results may serve as a guide for the rehabilitation of\nthe lake.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Urmia lake is a high salinity lake in northwestern Iran with considerable volume and\nwater level fluctuations. Water levels have dropped dramatically in recent decades due\nto a deficiency of river system input and excess outflow due to evaporation. River systems\ninflow is affected by human involvement and climate change, whereas evaporation-based\noutflow is more affected by global warming and water level (Lahijani et al. 2021). Salt\naccumulation spreads throughout the lake's bottom and coastline during the significant\nwater level drop. Considering the absence of water intake, the bottom salt load produces\na drop in basin volume, which modifies basin physiography in terms of water level. A total\nof 2,790\u00d7106 m\u00b3 of salt has been accumulated during the previous few decades, equating\nto a 73-centimeter-thick salt coating on the lake's bottom. Since this salt load plays a\ncritical role in filling the basin volume, the water volume of Urmia lake cannot be obtained\nusing the basin volume-water level relation during extreme water level in fall (Lahijani et\nal. 2021). The lake's salinity has grown to more than 300 g/l in recent years as a result of\ndrought and rising agricultural water needs in the lake's basin, and huge parts of the lake\nbottom have been dried (Eimanifar and Mohebbi 2007). Lakes drying up, among other\nthings, can have a huge influence on food supply. At the basin level, lakes integrate\nclimatic variability. These changes have an impact on food production and consumption\n(metabolism) in lake environments, both nearshore and in open water. While the shallow\nnearshore ecosystem is vital for agricultural production, many lake studies concentrate\non the offshore ecosystem (Scordo et al. 2022). Lake drying might make it difficult to\nprovide the consistent, inexpensive, and nutritious food supplies needed to keep the\nworld's population healthy (Feizizadeh et al. 2022). Food consumption and production\nwere lower in dry and wet years than in years with medium meteorological conditions.\nAdditionally, throughout dry and wet years, animal biomass dropped, and the nearshore\nbottom ecosystem was more vulnerable to changes due to a considerable fall in food\nsupply. Differential influences within lake ecosystems are caused by climatic variables.\nAs a result, if only one habitat is researched, lake management may be inadequate\n(Scordo et al. 2022, Nikpour, et al. 2025, Reihanifar et al. 2024 ).\nHydrologic parameters are important for preserving a water body's structure and\nfunction, and they influence a variety of abiotic elements, which might have an impact on"}, {"title": "2.

The Fuzzy VIKOR\ntechnique simplified the ranking of climate-smart agriculture solutions and indicated the\nbest practicable strategy for reducing the Urmia Lake disaster in the eastern half of the\nbasin based on the findings.

The driving hypothesis of this study was that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) could provide novel biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and treatment management due to its potential to monitor microcirculatory alterations. We conducted a comprehensive study involving HSI data of the palm and fingers from more than 480 patients on the day of their intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The findings demonstrate that HSI measurements can predict sepsis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.76; 0.84]) and mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 (95% CI [0.65; 0.79]). The predictive performance improves substantially when additional clinical data is incorporated, leading to an AUROC of up to 0.94 (95% CI [0.92; 0.96]) for sepsis and 0.84 (95% CI [0.78; 0.89]) for mortality. We conclude that HSI presents novel imaging biomarkers for the rapid, non-invasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, suggesting its potential as an important modality for guiding diagnosis and treatment.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Main", "content": "Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. It represents a leading cause of mortality and critical illness worldwide, accounting for 19.7% of global deaths in 2017 [2]. As the clinical diagnosis of sepsis relies on the presence of organ dysfunction, only patients in advanced stages of the sepsis syndrome are typ- ically identified [1]. The resulting delay in sepsis diagnosis is critical as the risk of mortality esca- lates with each hour of treatment delay due to irreversible organ damage [3]. Conversely, patients incorrectly presumed to have sepsis are often treated unnecessarily with antibiotics, which con- tributes to the development of multidrug-resistant organisms [4]. A critical aspect of sepsis manage- ment is the early and accurate diagnosis prior to the onset of persistent organ dysfunction. This task is complicated by the nonspecific signs and symptoms of the sepsis syndrome, along with the complex, heterogeneous, and not yet fully understood sepsis pathophysiology [5]. A particu- lar challenge lies in distinguishing between septic and non-septic critically ill patients in the inten- sive care unit (ICU) due to the higher baseline illness severity and frequent organ failure from both septic and non-septic inflammation [6].\nBeyond the early identification of septic patients, the early and accurate identification of ICU patients at high risk of death is crucial. This is because it can substantially improve individual patient outcomes by enabling the timely imple- mentation of appropriate interventions, thereby enhancing patient care [7]. Moreover, it has the potential to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of critical care delivery. This could be achieved through optimised allocation of limited resources, informed decisions regarding palliative care, and a deeper understanding of the factors that influence patient outcomes [7, 8].\nOver the past decades, considerable research efforts have focused on identifying biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction, with over 250 molecules proposed as potential diag- nostic or prognostic markers. However, to date, no single biomarker has demonstrated outstand- ing sensitivity and specificity for detecting sepsis and predicting mortality [9].\nMore recently, studies have investigated the use of machine learning to predict sepsis and mortality based on high-dimensional clinical data extracted from electronic health records (EHRS) [10]. The random forest model has emerged as the most commonly employed machine learning model in these studies [11]. A 2020 meta-analysis, which included 28 papers presenting 130 models, reported area under the receiver operating char- acteristic curve (AUROC) values ranging from 0.68 to 0.99 for predicting sepsis up to 48 hours before onset [12, 13]. Despite the promising per- formance metrics reported in research studies, the clinical translation of EHR-based sepsis and mortality prediction models faces substantial chal- lenges. EHR data, which is primarily collected for the purpose of clinical documentation and billing, lacks standardisation, is incomplete and inaccu- rate and contains inherent biases (e.g., association between the frequency of measurement and the severity of the disease, sample selection biases) [14]. These factors can lead to limited general- izability on external datasets, as demonstrated for several EHR-based sepsis prediction models [15, 16]. Furthermore, while EHR adoption is widespread in high-income countries, it lags in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 85% of sepsis cases occur [2]. This disparity is due to limited availability of expensive monitoring equipment, restricted laboratory access, insuffi- cient technical support, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of proper training and implementation frameworks [17].\nIn recent years, the monitoring of microcircula- tory alterations in critically ill patients has gained attention [18]. Due to the common decoupling of microcirculation and systemic haemodynam- ics in sepsis, systemic haemodynamic parameters (e.g., blood pressure, cardiac output) are insuf- ficient for effectively monitoring microcirculation [18, 19]. Imaging methods such as sublingual microscopy, laser Doppler flowmetry, laser speckle contrast imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) have revealed that microcirculatory dysfunction in sepsis is charac- terised by reduced capillary density and increased heterogeneity in microperfusion, leading to local zones of hypoxia [20, 21]. This dysfunction devel- ops early during sepsis [19] and is a key driver of"}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "Using the medical device-graded HSI system Tivita\u00ae 2.0 Surgery Edition (Diaspective Vision, Am Salzhaff, Germany), we collected HSI data and corresponding red-green-blue (RGB) images from the skin of all patients admitted to the interdisciplinary surgical ICU at the University Hospital Heidelberg over one year. This resulted in data from 308 non-septic and 129 septic patients. Successful follow-up to determine the survival sta- tus at 30 days of inclusion could be achieved for 483 patients, including 68 non-survivors (14%). The mortality rate was 27% (35/129) for patients diagnosed with sepsis at the time of admission, compared to a lower rate of 6% (18/308) for those without sepsis at admission. The palm and annu- lar finger were chosen as measurement sites due to their easy accessibility and low melanin content.\nAs shown in Figure 2, deep learning-based diag- nosis of sepsis from the palm was achievable with an AUROC of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.76; 0.84]), while the finger measurements yielded an AUROC of 0.72 (95% CI [0.67; 0.77]). Also for mortality prediction, the palm measure- ment site yielded better classification performance (AUROC 0.72 (95% CI [0.65; 0.79])), compared to the finger measurements (AUROC 0.65 (95% CI [0.58; 0.73])).

Consequently, functional parameters such as oxygen saturation, perfusion, haemoglobin content, and water content can be approximated from HSI data [29, 30].\nAccording to the formulas in [29], tissue oxygen saturation, perfusion index, haemoglobin index and water index were computed, and dis- tributions for septic and non-septic patients, as well as survivors and non-survivors are shown in Figure 3.

Based on the to the best of our knowledge largest HSI patient cohort to date, we derived the following key findings:\n1.  HSI biomarker: Both sepsis and mortality can be predicted from HSI data with high accuracy using deep learning. Septic patients and non- survivors have significantly lower tissue oxygen saturation, and higher tissue haemoglobin and water content than non-septic patients and non-survivors. Predictions from HSI measure- ments of the palm are superior to those from the annular finger.\n2.  Combination with structured clinical data: Incorporating structured clinical data enhances classification performance, yielding an AUROC of up to 0.94 and 0.84 for sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction, respectively.\n3.  Comparison to clinical biomarkers and scores: Our HSI + clinical data models outperform widely used clinical biomarkers and scores that were suggested for sepsis diagnosis and mortal- ity prediction."}, {"title": "3.1 Strengths and limitations of our\nHSI biomarkers", "content": "We believe the primary strengths of our HSI- based sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction are its objectivity, non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness and speed, as predictions can be obtained from a single HSI cube acquired at the bedside within seconds. Additionally, HSI systems enable mobile measurements, and could thus be performed in various hospital wards, such as the emergency department, or even in ambulances. Although HSI systems are not yet widely used clinically, they have evolved rapidly over the past two decades from custom research prototypes to medically cer- tified systems, like the one used in this study [37]. Manufacturers such as imec (Leuven, Belgium) and HAIC (Hanover, Germany) are currently focusing on developing more compact, real-time HSI devices and scaling production to achieve high-volume, low-cost availability.\nWe acknowledge that our classification models based on HSI data alone may not be sufficiently accurate as a standalone diagnostic and prognos- tic tool. However, we believe our HSI biomarker has high potential as a pre-screening tool to iden- tify patients for which time-consuming and costly tests (e.g. laboratory measurements) and exten- sive monitoring should be performed. This is particularly advantageous in resource-limited set- tings, such as LMICS, where approximately half of critical care interventions are delivered outside of the ICU [38], and in situations requiring immedi- ate decisions, such as emergency treatment.\nWe showed that substantial performance improvements are possible by integrating a few clinical parameters available at the bedside. For instance, including the administered nora- drenaline dose as an additional input improved the AUROC for sepsis prediction from 0.80 (95% CI [0.76; 0.84]) to 0.87 (95% CI [0.83; 0.90]). We want to emphasise, however, that incorporating clinical data may introduce biases and limit generalisabil- ity. For example, treatment choices such as the administered noradrenaline dose depend on the implementation of clinical guidelines, which are subject to variation over time and across health systems.\nWhile we showed that the HSI + clinical data models largely outperformed widely used"}, {"title": "3.2 Comparison to the state of the\nart", "content": "Previous research has explored characteristic pat- terns in tissue functional parameters derived from HSI when comparing septic patients to healthy volunteers [24, 25], as well as septic non-survivors to survivors [26]. Recent initial work on HSI-based sepsis diagnosis by ourselves [27] and others [28] showed promising early results for differentiating between sepsis patients and healthy volunteers or"}, {"title": "3.3 Future work", "content": "A key limitation of our study is that all data were collected from a single surgical ICU in Germany. External validation is required to confirm the gen- eralizability of our HSI biomarker across different ICUs and study populations. Furthermore, given the key strengths of our HSI biomarker, which enables a rapid, non-invasive, cost-effective, and mobile assessment of sepsis diagnosis and mor- tality, investigating its performance in resource- constrained and time-critical settings, such as ambulances, emergency wards, and LMICs, is a promising future direction. Additionally, since an estimated 40% of sepsis cases in 2017 occurred in children under 5 years old [2], expanding the cohort to include infants is of interest.\nWhile we consider our single time-point mea- surements advantageous for enabling immediate diagnosis and low resource requirements, stud- ies collecting longitudinal HSI data could expand the potential of HSI biomarkers. For example, the current therapeutic target in shock therapy is macrohaemodynamic stabilisation (e.g., maintain- ing normative arterial blood pressure), but crit- ically ill patients, particularly those with sepsis, often experience a loss of haemodynamic coher- ence, resulting in dissociation between macro- and microcirculation [43]. While no other widely avail- able clinical data can capture the spatial distri- bution of tissue microcirculation, HSI biomarkers may offer novel therapeutic strategies by evalu- ating the effects of the implemented therapy on the tissue microcirculation and guiding treatment. Additionally, longitudinally acquired HSI data could enhance understanding of features related to disease improvement or worsening."}, {"title": "3.4 Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we addressed the critical need for reliable biomarkers to identify septic patients"}, {"title": "4 Methods", "content": "Study design\nHSI data was collected at the Heidelberg Uni- versity Hospital following approval by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University, Germany (study reference number: S- 288/2022).

Requirements", "content": "DIHN adapts the core tenets of DIN to the healthcare domain, specifically addressing the requirements that:\n\u2022 No authority can resume access and management controls over Participants' data.\n\u2022 Only Participants can decide who accesses their data for federated learning.\n\u2022 No third-party broker determines reward allocations for Participants' contributions.\nDIN is a cross-sector framework, originally designed to preserve participant sovereignty over data while fostering collaborative Al efforts across various domains [3]. In the context of DIHN, this generic framework is repurposed to address the unique challenges and opportunities within healthcare.\nThis healthcare-specific adaptation ensures that no single authority controls the FL process, preserving participant sovereignty over their health data while fostering collaborative Al efforts. Crucially, the DIHN framework prevents data other than model updates from needing to leave the Personal Data Stores (PDS), maintaining user privacy and control in a healthcare context.\nDecentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN), as a healthcare application use case of DIN, acknowledges the ongoing existence of institutional silos in traditional healthcare. Designed to facilitate a transition towards decentralized, sovereign data stores controlled by individuals, DIHN offers flexible integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and institutional data systems, supporting a transition to decentralized, sovereign data stores. By allowing broad participation in the federated learning (FL) protocol, the DIHN protocol complements new avenues for access to scalable data for Al engineering in a decentralized fashion, specifically within the healthcare sector."}, {"title": "4. Systems Architecture: An Overview", "content": "This framework supports robust and ethical AI training in healthcare by allowing participants to maintain sovereignty over their health data while simultaneously benefiting financially and contributing to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem. This ecosystem harnesses collective AI capabilities to advance healthcare algorithms, demonstrating new possibilities in medical research and patient care.\nTo meet this frameworks requirements and overcome the challenges specific to healthcare, DIHN leverages three key components:\n1. Root Layer: This foundational layer provides an overview of self-sovereign server technology (SSST), which underpins the system's ability to maintain individual data sovereignty in healthcare ecosystems.\n2. Real-World Layer: This layer focuses on practical healthcare workflows such as prescriptions, referrals, and investigations-conducted in a sovereign manner within the Decentralized Healthcare Intelligence Network (DIHN). It integrates principles from existing frameworks to ensure secure, patient-controlled exchanges. Additionally, the layer emphasizes the flow of information through the sovereign integration of Medical AI Devices, which interact with patient-owned health records. This enhances healthcare delivery by enabling efficient, transparent, and patient-centric care within the DIHN framework.\n3. Intelligence Layer: This layer outlines the integration of the DIN protocol for a scalable and secure trustless federated learning process. It also explains the specific utility of the reward mechanism in funding decentralized healthcare insurance solutions.\nBy leveraging these decentralized mechanisms across these three layers, the DIHN framework not only addresses the current challenges in health data management but also catalyzes the adoption of scalable, sovereign data solutions. These solutions uphold individual rights, foster technological advancements, and pave the way for new use cases in healthcare. Ultimately, DIHN supports the ongoing transition towards decentralized data ownership, promising more equitable, efficient, and innovative healthcare ecosystems for the future.\nKey stakeholders previously specified in the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) ecosystem include [3]:\n\u2022 Participants: Individuals who own and control their health data stores (i.e., patient's). They contribute data to the federated learning process while maintaining privacy and benefiting from collaborative AI training.\n\u2022 Model Owners: Entities such as pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, or AI developers who utilize the FL protocols to enhance their models with decentralized health data, without compromising individual data sovereignty.\n\u2022 Evaluators: Network-staked entities responsible for decentralized auditing. They ensure transparency and fairness in evaluating participant contributions and overseeing the distribution of rewards.\nBuilding upon these three stakeholders introduced in the DIN, DIHN introduces two additional key ecosystem stakeholders:\n\u2022 Healthcare Professional: Healthcare professionals (i.e., a physician) who use self-sovereign server technologies (SSST) to securely interact with the network, verify patient relationships, and access health records while maintaining high standards of privacy and security.\n\u2022 Medical AI Devices: Al-powered tools and devices with their own public/private key identifiers, capable of interacting with patient data to support diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare delivery within the decentralized ecosystem."}, {"title": "5 Methodology", "content": "This expanded set of stakeholders enhances DIHN's capability to address healthcare-specific challenges and opportunities, fostering a more comprehensive and efficient decentralized health system.\nDIHN employs smart contracts to manage crucial processes, including intelligence SC for coordinating and rewarding AI training, and token SC enabling Evaluators to assess participant contributions in a secure, proof-of-stake ecosystem.\nParticipants receive cryptographic micropayments into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the system. This not only provides immediate value to individuals for their data contributions but also aligns with a long-term roadmap aimed at funding decentralized insurance solutions. This innovative approach could potentially transform the healthcare financing landscape.\nBy leveraging these decentralized mechanisms, the DIHN framework not only addresses the current challenges in health data management but also catalyzes the adoption of scalable, sovereign data solutions. These solutions uphold individual rights, foster technological advancements, and pave the way for new use cases in healthcare.

This innovative approach re-defines how individuals, particularly patients, manage their digital identities and health data in a decentralized ecosystem.\nAt its core, SSST functions as an identity container, combining a user-friendly mobile interface with a continuously connected server. This setup allows patients to securely store and control their health attributes (such as prescription details or lab results), access policies, and transaction receipts [4]. Imagine having a digital vault on your smartphone, where you not only keep your most sensitive health information but also dictate who can access it and when.\nBlockchain technology is well-suited for decentralized identity (DID) that does not depend on a centralized root of trust [4]. DID extends blockchain methods to enable a lifelong practical and reliable identifier (e.g., a public/private cryptographic key pair) and attributes linked to that identifier under the self-sovereign control of the individual person [4]. A number of DID systems are emerging, and this technology under the total control of the physician (MD) and the patient can leverage DID to allow for a prescription or equivalent regulated transaction [10].\nA key component of SSST is the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) [10]. With DID-based self-sovereign identity:\n\u2022 Patients can selectively disclose only necessary health information to providers.\n\u2022 Providers can authenticate themselves and access patient records with patient permission.\n\u2022 Health data can be linked to patient DIDs while remaining under patient control.\n\u2022 Interactions between patients and providers can be securely logged using DIDs.\nThe white paper \"Powering the Physician-Patient Relationship with HIE of One Blockchain Health IT,\" presented by Adrian Gropper, MD, in 2016, provides an excellent overview of the real-world benefits SSST can offer to both individuals seeking healthcare and the professionals providing it [10]. The major benefit of self-sovereign support technology in this context is the re-decentralization of the trusted relationship between the physician and the patient. The full value of the medical consultation is now available to the two principal parties, with each managing their own policies to provide access to shared resources such as a physician directory or a pharmacy. Additionally, this approach enhances security through diversity, as patients and physician can adopt different self-sovereign technologies to support their respective security, privacy, and economic interests [10]."}, {"title": "5.1.2 Personal Health Record", "content": "In the context of the DIHN framework, the Personal Health Record (PHR) functions as a Personal Data Store (PDS)-a concept that, while central to this discussion, will not be elaborated on here for brevity. See references [12], [13]. Building upon the foundation of Self-Sovereign Server Technology (SSST), the PHR is a critical component within the DIHN ecosystem, enabling patients to manage and share their health information securely and efficiently. Unlike traditional health records, the PHR is designed to be a dynamic, patient-controlled gateway to a lifetime of health information, protected by multiple layers of cryptographic security [10], [14].\nAt the core of this system is SSST, which acts as a secure bridge connecting healthcare professionals to the patient's health records. With the patient's consent, healthcare professionals can access and update these records through a secure, user-friendly interface [10], [14]. This process is similar to using a specialized, highly secure app, ensuring both ease of use and strong protection of sensitive health data."}, {"title": "5.2. Real-World Layer", "content": "A distinguishing feature of the DIHN framework is its ability to incorporate and expand upon established principles, such as those discussed in pre-existing works. The framework offers flexibility in managing access permissions by allowing patients to store these permissions either off-chain (on a private, secure server) or on-chain (directly on the blockchain). This approach ensures precise control over who can access their information and under what conditions [15], [16]. This system functions like a digital lock on a medical file cabinet, enabling patients to grant or revoke access to specific records for different healthcare providers as needed.\nThis level of control raises important considerations regarding the balance between patient autonomy and medical expertise. For example, while patients are generally motivated to maintain accurate records, certain scenarios such as psychiatric care or pediatrics-may require professional oversight [17], [18], [19]. The DIHN framework is designed to accommodate these nuances, enabling customized access policies that respect both patient rights and the need for expert medical guidance.\nThe technical implementation is streamlined and secure. Healthcare providers access patient records through an API portal, governed by the permissions specified by the patient [20]. This process is akin to having a personal health data concierge, ensuring that only those with the correct credentials and permissions can access sensitive information."}, {"title": "5.2.1 Interaction Layer: Redefining Patient-Doctor Relationships", "content": "The interaction between patients and physicians in the Decentralized Healthcare Intelligence Network (DIHN) framework represents a significant shift in healthcare provision, leveraging blockchain technology and self-sovereign identities to create a secure, patient-centric ecosystem. The objective is not merely to add a layer of technological sophistication but to fundamentally reshape how healthcare interactions are conducted, ensuring greater transparency, privacy, and patient control.\nIn the DIHN system, physicians establish their professional identity using a cryptographic key pair, functioning as a highly sophisticated, unforgeable digital signature [20]. Unlike traditional systems where credentialing might involve multiple intermediaries, in this framework, the physicians identity is verified by trusted entities such as medical societies or reputable third-party services [20]. This verification process ensures that only qualified professionals can access the system, aligning with the need for trust and integrity in healthcare interactions [20]."}, {"title": "5.2.2 Medical AI Devices", "content": "The DIHN framework introduces a theoretical model for integrating Medical Al Devices into a decentralized healthcare system. These systems are defined in this paper as entities that handle health data-whether by storing, retrieving, generating, sending, or processing it, including tools such as triage systems, diagnostic instruments, and AI decision support systems.\nCurrently, implementing AI systems in clinical environments faces major challenges [21]. A significant issue is the fragmentation of health data across various provider systems, which complicates the development and deployment of effective AI tools [4], [15], [21], [22], [23], [24]. These tools typically need accurate and up-to-date data from a single, unified source.\nThe proposed framework addresses this challenge with an approach that might seem ironic at first: it suggests centralizing all patient health data in one location. However, this centralization is not in the traditional sense of a single, centralized database. Instead, it centralizes data at the point where it is most relevant the patient's own Personal Health Record (PHR). This means that while the data is distributed across various sources, it is centralized in the hands of the individual it concerns across their lifetime. This method resolves disputes over data access between healthcare providers and ensures that Al-generated outputs are recorded in the patient-owned PHR. A more complete PHR with information held over an individual's lifetime will enable more comprehensive information, thus enhancing the precision and accuracy of AI tools (e.g., decision support) as they work with more complete data about the patient.\nIn this model, Medical AI Devices would each be assigned their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These DIDs function similarly to unique digital IDs for people or organizations, allowing devices to interact directly with the patient's PHR [4]. This setup enables devices to read from and write to the PHR as needed."}, {"title": "5.3 Intelligence Layer", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.3.1 Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) Protocol", "content": "Medical AI Devices working with physicians would use the PHR to record their outputs, promoting better collaboration between physicians and AI tools. This approach aids in making informed healthcare decisions and enhances the accuracy of specific tasks in the healthcare process, such as diagnostic tools or mobile health devices.\nThe DIHN framework envisions Medical AI Devices running algorithms on the data stored in the PHR. This data could include details entered by physicians (e.g., symptoms, medical history, physical examination results) and additional information from sources like imaging or mobile health devices. The paper acknowledges that this is a relatively new area of research and calls for further study into integrating Medical AI Devices into clinical workflows using patient-owned PHR systems. This includes ensuring that these devices access accurate health data, assigning DIDs to Medical AI Devices, and effectively integrating AI with medical practice.\nTo implement this framework, a decentralized federated learning (FL) environment is essential. This environment would allow Al tools to develop using patient-owned health data while maintaining patient control over their information.\nIn summary, this theoretical framework sets the stage for the next layer of the system the intelligence layer-focused on overcoming the challenges of deploying Al in a decentralized healthcare ecosystem.\nDecentralized Intelligence Network's (DIN) protocol operationalizes the federated learning (FL) architecture outlined in Section 4 [3]. Built on a decentralized public blockchain infrastructure, the DIN protocol manages the coordination and rewards process for training machine learning models using data stored in Participant-owned Personal Data Stores (PDSs) [3]. In DIHN, this process occurs using patient-owned personal health records (PHRs). This approach ensures data sovereignty while enabling collaborative Al development.\nParticipants opt into FL protocols defined by an intelligence smart contract (SC) on a public blockchain. The protocol leverages the blockchain to coordinate the FL process and manage rewards, while ensuring that raw data remains within the Participant's sovereign datastore [3]. Only model updates are shared during the FL process, preserving privacy and control.\nTo enhance scalability and computational efficiency, the DIN protocol incorporates an off-chain decentralized file storage system, such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [26]. This system provides a location for uploading and downloading model updates during the learning process, optimizing participation costs and complementing the blockchain's transaction recording capabilities [3].\nThis setup ensures a fair and transparent reward system while maintaining data sovereignty and reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure. The following sections detail the specific methodologies and operational mechanisms of the DIN protocol, including the roles of key participants such as Model Owners, Participants, and Evaluators [3]."}, {"title": "5.3.2 Decentralized Auditing Protocol", "content": "Delineating the roles of Participant and Evaluator in the protocol raises concerns about the potential misuse of the control dataset by Evaluators in federated learning (FL) scenarios. In previous examples, each Participant evaluated every other Participant using their data and an objective scoring metric [8], [28]. However, once we distinguish between Participant and Evaluator and adjust the protocol to scale and generalize to other data types, a new issue emerges. Evaluators might download and illicitly share the control dataset published by the Model Owner with Participants in one or more aggregator subgroups in a FL rounds when benchmarking Participants' contributions after Model Owenr signals final round, potentially leading to harmful activities such as model poisoning or unfair compensation during the model training process.\nTo mitigate these risks, implementing secure evaluation mechanisms where the test dataset remains concealed from the Evaluators is essential. Evaluators can prove to the system they correctly evaluated against the control dataset without accessing it, mitigating risks of misuse or leakage. Evaluators can be provided with high-quality, well-distributed, and highly representative control datasets by the Model Owner. Evaluators can use this as a benchmark to evaluate each Participant's models as shown in Figure 6. The step-by-step protocol elaborates on the processes of Evaluators' involvement in the decentralized auditing protocol within the rewards process, as illustrated in Figure 6, as follows:\n1. Model Owner selects secure computation method: a. Opens a TEE within the aggregation server, and/or b. Chooses alternative privacy-preserving computation meeting security standardsModel Owner distributes encrypted control dataset to chosen secure environment.\n2. Within secure environment: a. Evaluators compute performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) on models using control dataset and benchmark using objective scoring metrics (i.e., Substra, Median Scoring [Blockflow]). b. Evaluators utilize remote attestation mechanisms to prove secure execution. c. Evaluators generate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for each metric.\n3. Contingency for MPC: a. Participants encrypt model updates using MPC or other privacy-preserving technique to benchmark Participants' scores. b. Evaluator evaluates models on encrypted test dataset using privacy-preserving protocol."}, {"title": "6. Threat Model", "content": "The papers threat model addresses potential risks in the federated learning (FL) process, ensuring robust security and privacy. The protocol is resilient to up to 50% malicious participants, leveraging public/private key cryptography and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. By using immutable storage on IPFS we ensure data integrity. Additionally, the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) mitigates risks associated with model evaluation and reward distribution. This comprehensive approach ensures the security and reliability of the FL process, maintaining participant trust and data sovereignty.\nFirstly, in an experiment with N agents, it is resistant up to M\u2208 [0, N/2) agents neglecting to follow the protocol for the experiment to maintain its integrity [8]. For example, public/private key cryptography and a proof-of-stake consensus protocol secure the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, there are no feasible attacks on the Ethereum Network, without controlling 50% of the computational power of the entire Ethereum network and such an attack has never been successful on the Ethereum mainnet [31].\nSecondly, as a public blockchain is public and anonymous, clients could enroll multiple times in an experiment and thus have a disproportionate participation. However, through decentralized identity verification, verifiable credentialing, or manual processes, agents can ensure that each other agent controls only one account [15], [32], [33].\nThird, IPFS is immutable, meaning agents cannot change their model after submitting the cryptographic hash to the smart contract [26]. Like in BlockFlow, the DIN protocol requires each agent to report if it can load strictly more than N/2 models, and have strictly more than N/2 agents report the same for their model. The DIN threat model guarantees that there are strictly more than N/2 honest Participants. Additionally, as long as N/2 or more Evaluators who receive these models for evaluation are honest, which the DIN protocol guarantees, the system remains resistant to N/2 attacks. Since IPFS allows anyone to share any content, one or more honest parties would share the model with all other Participants if they are unable to retrieve a model directly from the source (e.g., due to firewall restrictions). Therefore, each Participant would still be able to obtain all necessary models [8], [26].\nFourth, there are several possible attacks on the contribution scoring procedure itself. Malicious models are those with weights that do not reflect a truthful dataset, such as models trained on randomly generated data or inverted output features. Naively averaging such models into a global model would likely harm the shared objective. The DIN protocol can choose contribution-scoring procedures that penalize those who submit malicious models. For instance, BlockFlow (2020) uses a contributivity score system where lower scores result in less cryptocurrency received [8], [26]. In this system, any agent with an evaluation more than 0.5 away from the median score receives an overall score of 0 and no share of the cryptocurrency pool [8], [26]. This penalizes attempts to fabricate scores, as the protocol limits a Participant's overall score to the evaluation furthest from the median [8], [26].\nFifth, Participants can collude during the training process to submit better models by secretly sharing raw data or models among M<N2 colluding Participants [8], [26]. The DIN protocol rewards Participants who contribute strong models, and it is acceptable for multiple Participants to submit identical models. Such collusion is not considered an attack, as it is similar to having many Participants with strong datasets [8], [26]. For attacks by Evaluators in the evaluation process, the I smart contract can use encryption and a commit-then-reveal protocol (e.g., Secret Sharing MPC, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman keys, etc.) to prevent Evaluators from copying others' scores without collusion [34]. If a minority subset of malicious Evaluators reports perfect 1.0 scores for certain models and 0.0 scores for all others (e.g., models from honest agents), the median score is guaranteed to be between the minimum and maximum scores reported by the honest agents, as long as there are strictly fewer than half malicious Evaluators [8], [26]. Evaluators are incentivized to stake a native token to gain the right to evaluate Participant models in the rewards process within a proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystem. Evaluators found acting maliciously are slashed from the network, losing some or all of their stake, thus maintaining network security and incentivizing honest work.\nSixth, in this papers threat model, it is crucial that the control dataset provided by the Model Owner remains encrypted to prevent its misuse. If the control dataset were accessible to colluding Participants, Model Owners, Evaluators, or other entities, they could exploit it to skew the reward distribution. For example, colluding parties could use the control dataset to strategically improve their model performance or manipulate evaluation outcomes to gain undeserved rewards. Encrypting the control dataset ensures that it cannot be revealed or utilized by these entities to unfairly influence the results. To enhance security further, dual protection strategies can be employed. For instance, the preferred scoring method, such as median scoring used by BlockFlow (2020), can be integrated into the protocol [8]. In this approach, any score deviating significantly from the median-beyond a specified threshold can be penalized. BlockFlow's method maps any score differing by more than 0.5 from the model's median to a score of 0, with an a priori score set at 0.5 [8]. This mechanism encourages evaluators to provide honest assessments by penalizing scores that deviate substantially from the median. This method helps mitigate the risk of anomalous scores due to collusion and maintains fairness in the reward distribution process. Overall, encrypting the control dataset and employing robust scoring mechanisms collectively safeguard the integrity of the evaluation process and prevent potential manipulation by malicious actors.\nSeventh, both the aggregation process involving trusted third-party secure aggregation servers and other such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) introduce distinct threat models. Concerns with aggregation hardware include potential data interception and manipulation, insider threats at third-party providers, hardware vulnerabilities such as side-channel attacks, and compliance issues with data protection regulations [35], [36]. TEEs, while isolating sensitive computations, face risks from hardware exploits, software vulnerabilities, and third-party trust issues. Additionally, implementations of ZKPs must be carefully managed to avoid cryptographic flaws that could undermine their effectiveness [37]. To counteract these threats, robust encryption, rigorous access controls, regular security audits, and compliance assurance are employed [37]. These measures ensure that data remains confidential and integral, reducing the dependency on trust by making processes transparent and verifiable through smart contracts on the blockchain. This strategy enhances security and stabilizes residual risks within a robust, transparent operational framework."}, {"title": "7. Decentralized Insurance Solution", "content": "The DIHN framework introduces an innovative approach to healthcare financing through a decentralized insurance solution, creating a self-sustaining cycle of value in healthcare.\nAt its core, this system uses cryptographic micropayments as a reward mechanism for patients who contribute their health data to Al development.

This approach ensures data sovereignty while enabling collaborative AI development. Imagine receiving a small digital payment each time your health information helps train an Al model to improve healthcare outcomes. These micropayments are deposited directly into patients' digital wallets (e.g., Taho [38]), seamlessly and securely."}, {"title": "8. Public Goods, Governance, and Tokenomics", "content": "While it may seem unconventional in a technical paper, this work underscores the importance of considering social aspects and tangible incentives in the design of modern systems architectures. Both early internet pioneers and recent literature emphasize this necessity [40]. Key social themes include:\nPublic Goods Initiatives: Projects such as Gitcoin funding and Optimism's vision for community-driven proposals and funding of public goods ecosystems illustrate the growing emphasis on supporting shared resources and communal benefits [41], [42].\nNon-speculative Tokenomics Design: This involves unique evaluation mechanisms and staking methods, combined with Harberger taxation and partial-common ownership (PCO) [43]. These elements contribute to the development of an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) for a new ERC token standard aimed at funding public goods. By providing a staking pool to determine rewards issued to Evaluators, we can charge zero network fees [44]. Model Owners can pay in stable coin to data holders, ensuring rewards are not fluctuating and data is appropriately rewarded.\nGovernance Concepts and Network States: This encompasses various models including Gov4Git (non-coin-based voting), quadratic voting, and delegate mechanisms to engage contributors [45]. The concept of sovereign networks, which delves into decentralized governance, commons-based peer production, and digital communities with shared values operating independently of traditional structures, is particularly relevant. Sovereign networks explore the potential for decentralized models to reshape governance and resource distribution in novel ways [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51].\nThese ideas resonate with communities such as the Plurality for the Future of Collaborative Technology and Democracy, the Ethereum blockchain ecosystems, and the Kernel Community [40], [52], [53], [54]. Their work highlights the importance of embracing ongoing experimentation and willingness to explore new ideas, which is crucial for advancing equitable, transparent systems that serve the public good.\nA flexible and inclusive rollout, driven by community input, can help mitigate wealth concentration in the crypto ecosystem.

Conclusion and Future Directions", "content": "Decentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN) is a groundbreaking extension of the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN), designed to transform healthcare data management. DIHN builds on DIN's principles to address healthcare-specific challenges by utilizing personal data stores, decentralized federated learning, and a trustless rewards system.\nDecentralized Intelligence Health Network (DIHN) extends the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) framework to offer a transformative approach to healthcare data management. DIHN empowers patients with complete control over their health data, which remains securely within their Personal Health Records (PHR) stores. Patients can easily manage their data-sharing preferences by toggling a simple opt-in or opt-out switch, streamlining interactions with healthcare providers and researchers.\nThe system employs DIN's scalable federated learning protocol on a public blockchain, ensuring that patient data never leaves the PHR. Instead, only model parameter updates are shared, employing advanced privacy-preserving techniques to safeguard data. A decentralized, scalable auditing system fairly distributes cryptographic micropayments to incentivize patient participation, without intermediary control.\nDIHN addresses the challenge of data silos, facilitating large-scale, collaborative healthcare research while maintaining individual privacy. The streamlined opt-in/opt-out functionality and one-time setup enhance overall efficiency in patient interactions with healthcare services and research entities. Rather than being constrained by siloed data stores, broader adoption of the DIHN allows the FL protocol to operate across various geographical regions. This enables patients to opt in and contribute their health data, expanding the data pool beyond fragmented, patient-specific sources. As a result, AI tools can achieve greater accuracy, particularly for rare diseases, by leveraging a more comprehensive dataset that transcends individual patient silos.\nLooking to the future, DIHN aims to address crucial nuances beyond the core framework by incorporating data privacy measures, such as protocol opt-ins to protect Participant identities, potentially using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-Proofs). The network also plans to develop broader connections with sovereign data stores, explore non-speculative token designs, and work toward establishing a decentralized health insurance solution that offers wider coverage and additional financial incentives. These efforts will ultimately integrate DIHN into a comprehensive and innovative healthcare ecosystem.\nWe invite researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to engage with the DIHN framework. By collaborating, we aim to advance scalable, sovereign data solutions that enhance healthcare technology while respecting individual rights and data ownership. Together, we can build a more equitable, efficient, and innovative healthcare system that benefits all participants."}]}

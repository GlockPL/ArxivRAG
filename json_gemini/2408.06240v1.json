Requirements", "content": "DIHN adapts the core tenets of DIN to the healthcare domain, specifically addressing the requirements that:\n\u2022 No authority can resume access and management controls over Participants' data.\n\u2022 Only Participants can decide who accesses their data for federated learning.\n\u2022 No third-party broker determines reward allocations for Participants' contributions.\nDIN is a cross-sector framework, originally designed to preserve participant sovereignty over data while fostering collaborative\nAl efforts across various domains [3]. In the context of DIHN, this generic framework is repurposed to address the unique\nchallenges and opportunities within healthcare.\nThis healthcare-specific adaptation ensures that no single authority controls the FL process, preserving participant sovereignty\nover their health data while fostering collaborative Al efforts.

Systems Architecture: An Overview", "content": "This framework supports robust and ethical AI training in healthcare by allowing participants to maintain sovereignty over their\nhealth data while simultaneously benefiting financially and contributing to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem. This ecosystem\nharnesses collective AI capabilities to advance healthcare algorithms, demonstrating new possibilities in medical research and\npatient care.\nTo meet this frameworks requirements and overcome the challenges specific to healthcare, DIHN leverages three key\ncomponents:\n1. Root Layer: This foundational layer provides an overview of self-sovereign server technology (SSST), which\nunderpins the system's ability to maintain individual data sovereignty in healthcare ecosystems.\n2. Real-World Layer: This layer focuses on practical healthcare workflows such as prescriptions, referrals, and\ninvestigations-conducted in a sovereign manner within the Decentralized Healthcare Intelligence Network (DIHN). It\nintegrates principles from existing frameworks to ensure secure, patient-controlled exchanges. Additionally, the layer\nemphasizes the flow of information through the sovereign integration of Medical AI Devices, which interact with\npatient-owned health records. This enhances healthcare delivery by enabling efficient, transparent, and patient-centric\ncare within the DIHN framework.\n3. Intelligence Layer: This layer outlines the integration of the DIN protocol for a scalable and secure trustless federated\nlearning process. It also explains the specific utility of the reward mechanism in funding decentralized healthcare\ninsurance solutions.\nBy leveraging these decentralized mechanisms across these three layers, the DIHN framework not only addresses the current\nchallenges in health data management but also catalyzes the adoption of scalable, sovereign data solutions. These solutions\nuphold individual rights, foster technological advancements, and pave the way for new use cases in healthcare. Ultimately, DIHN\nsupports the ongoing transition towards decentralized data ownership, promising more equitable, efficient, and innovative\nhealthcare ecosystems for the future.\nKey stakeholders previously specified in the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) ecosystem include [3]:\n\u2022 Participants: Individuals who own and control their health data stores (i.e., patient's). They contribute data to the\nfederated learning process while maintaining privacy and benefiting from collaborative AI training.\n\u2022 Model Owners: Entities such as pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, or AI developers who utilize the FL\nprotocols to enhance their models with decentralized health data, without compromising individual data sovereignty.\n\u2022 Evaluators: Network-staked entities responsible for decentralized auditing. They ensure transparency and fairness in\nevaluating participant contributions and overseeing the distribution of rewards.\nBuilding upon these three stakeholders introduced in the DIN, DIHN introduces two additional key ecosystem\nstakeholders:\n\u2022 Healthcare Professional: Healthcare professionals (i.e., a physician) who use self-sovereign server technologies\n(SSST) to securely interact with the network, verify patient relationships, and access health records while maintaining\nhigh standards of privacy and security.\n\u2022 Medical AI Devices: Al-powered tools and devices with their own public/private key identifiers, capable of interacting\nwith patient data to support diagnosis, treatment, and healthcare delivery within the decentralized ecosystem."}, {"title": "5 Methodology", "content": "This expanded set of stakeholders enhances DIHN's capability to address healthcare-specific challenges and opportunities,\nfostering a more comprehensive and efficient decentralized health system.\nDIHN employs smart contracts to manage crucial processes, including intelligence SC for coordinating and rewarding AI\ntraining, and token SC enabling Evaluators to assess participant contributions in a secure, proof-of-stake ecosystem.\nParticipants receive cryptographic micropayments into their digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the system. This not only\nprovides immediate value to individuals for their data contributions but also aligns with a long-term roadmap aimed at funding\ndecentralized insurance solutions.

This innovative approach re-defines how individuals, particularly patients, manage\ntheir digital identities and health data in a decentralized ecosystem.\nAt its core, SSST functions as an identity container, combining a user-friendly mobile interface with a continuously connected\nserver. This setup allows patients to securely store and control their health attributes (such as prescription details or lab results),\naccess policies, and transaction receipts [4]. Imagine having a digital vault on your smartphone, where you not only keep your\nmost sensitive health information but also dictate who can access it and when.\nBlockchain technology is well-suited for decentralized identity (DID) that does not depend on a centralized root of trust [4]. DID\nextends blockchain methods to enable a lifelong practical and reliable identifier (e.g., a public/private cryptographic key pair) and\nattributes linked to that identifier under the self-sovereign control of the individual person [4]. A number of DID systems are\nemerging, and this technology under the total control of the physician (MD) and the patient can leverage DID to allow for a\nprescription or equivalent regulated transaction [10].\nA key component of SSST is the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) [10]. With DID-based self-sovereign identity:\n\u2022 Patients can selectively disclose only necessary health information to providers.\n\u2022 Providers can authenticate themselves and access patient records with patient permission.\n\u2022 Health data can be linked to patient DIDs while remaining under patient control.\n\u2022 Interactions between patients and providers can be securely logged using DIDs.\nThe white paper \"Powering the Physician-Patient Relationship with HIE of One Blockchain Health IT,\" presented by Adrian\nGropper, MD, in 2016, provides an excellent overview of the real-world benefits SSST can offer to both individuals seeking\nhealthcare and the professionals providing it [10]. The major benefit of self-sovereign support technology in this context is the\nre-decentralization of the trusted relationship between the physician and the patient. The full value of the medical consultation is\nnow available to the two principal parties, with each managing their own policies to provide access to shared resources such as a\nphysician directory or a pharmacy. Additionally, this approach enhances security through diversity, as patients and physician can\nadopt different self-sovereign technologies to support their respective security, privacy, and economic interests [10]."}, {"title": "5.1.2 Personal Health Record", "content": "In the context of the DIHN framework, the Personal Health Record (PHR) functions as a Personal Data Store (PDS)-a concept\nthat, while central to this discussion, will not be elaborated on here for brevity. See references [12], [13]. Building upon the\nfoundation of Self-Sovereign Server Technology (SSST), the PHR is a critical component within the DIHN ecosystem, enabling\npatients to manage and share their health information securely and efficiently. Unlike traditional health records, the PHR is\ndesigned to be a dynamic, patient-controlled gateway to a lifetime of health information, protected by multiple layers of\ncryptographic security [10], [14].\nAt the core of this system is SSST, which acts as a secure bridge connecting healthcare professionals to the patient's health\nrecords. With the patient's consent, healthcare professionals can access and update these records through a secure, user-friendly\ninterface [10], [14]. This process is similar to using a specialized, highly secure app, ensuring both ease of use and strong\nprotection of sensitive health data."}, {"title": "5.2.

The objective is not merely to add a layer of technological sophistication but to fundamentally\nreshape how healthcare interactions are conducted, ensuring greater transparency, privacy, and patient control.\nIn the DIHN system, physicians establish their professional identity using a cryptographic key pair, functioning as a highly\nsophisticated, unforgeable digital signature [20]. Unlike traditional systems where credentialing might involve multiple\nintermediaries, in this framework, the physicians identity is verified by trusted entities such as medical societies or reputable\nthird-party services [20]. This verification process ensures that only qualified professionals can access the system, aligning with\nthe need for trust and integrity in healthcare interactions [20]."}, {"title": "5.2.2 Medical AI Devices", "content": "The DIHN framework introduces a theoretical model for integrating Medical Al Devices into a decentralized healthcare system.\nThese systems are defined in this paper as entities that handle health data-whether by storing, retrieving, generating, sending, or\nprocessing it, including tools such as triage systems, diagnostic instruments, and AI decision support systems.\nCurrently, implementing AI systems in clinical environments faces major challenges [21]. A significant issue is the fragmentation\nof health data across various provider systems, which complicates the development and deployment of effective AI tools [4],\n[15], [21], [22], [23], [24]. These tools typically need accurate and up-to-date data from a single, unified source.\nThe proposed framework addresses this challenge with an approach that might seem ironic at first: it suggests centralizing all\npatient health data in one location. However, this centralization is not in the traditional sense of a single, centralized database.\nInstead, it centralizes data at the point where it is most relevant the patient's own Personal Health Record (PHR). This means\nthat while the data is distributed across various sources, it is centralized in the hands of the individual it concerns across their\nlifetime. This method resolves disputes over data access between healthcare providers and ensures that Al-generated outputs are\nrecorded in the patient-owned PHR. A more complete PHR with information held over an individual's lifetime will enable more\ncomprehensive information, thus enhancing the precision and accuracy of AI tools (e.g., decision support) as they work with\nmore complete data about the patient.\nIn this model, Medical AI Devices would each be assigned their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These DIDs function\nsimilarly to unique digital IDs for people or organizations, allowing devices to interact directly with the patient's PHR [4]. This\nsetup enables devices to read from and write to the PHR as needed."}, {"title": "5.3 Intelligence Layer", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.3.1 Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) Protocol", "content": "Decentralized Intelligence Network's (DIN) protocol operationalizes the federated learning (FL) architecture outlined in Section\n4 [3]. Built on a decentralized public blockchain infrastructure, the DIN protocol manages the coordination and rewards process\nfor training machine learning models using data stored in Participant-owned Personal Data Stores (PDSs) [3]. In DIHN, this\nprocess occurs using patient-owned personal health records (PHRs). This approach ensures data sovereignty while enabling\ncollaborative Al development.\nParticipants opt into FL protocols defined by an intelligence smart contract (SC) on a public blockchain. The protocol leverages\nthe blockchain to coordinate the FL process and manage rewards, while ensuring that raw data remains within the Participant's\nsovereign datastore [3]. Only model updates are shared during the FL process, preserving privacy and control.\nTo enhance scalability and computational efficiency, the DIN protocol incorporates an off-chain decentralized file storage system,\nsuch as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) [26]. This system provides a location for uploading and downloading model\nupdates during the learning process, optimizing participation costs and complementing the blockchain's transaction recording\ncapabilities [3].\nThis setup ensures a fair and transparent reward system while maintaining data sovereignty and reducing reliance on centralized\ninfrastructure. The following sections detail the specific methodologies and operational mechanisms of the DIN protocol,\nincluding the roles of key participants such as Model Owners, Participants, and Evaluators [3]."}, {"title": "5.3.2 Decentralized Auditing Protocol", "content": "Delineating the roles of Participant and Evaluator in the protocol raises concerns about the potential misuse of the control dataset\nby Evaluators in federated learning (FL) scenarios. In previous examples, each Participant evaluated every other Participant using\ntheir data and an objective scoring metric [8], [28]. However, once we distinguish between Participant and Evaluator and adjust\nthe protocol to scale and generalize to other data types, a new issue emerges. Evaluators might download and illicitly share the\ncontrol dataset published by the Model Owner with Participants in one or more aggregator subgroups in a FL rounds when\nbenchmarking Participants' contributions after Model Owenr signals final round, potentially leading to harmful activities such as\nmodel poisoning or unfair compensation during the model training process.\nTo mitigate these risks, implementing secure evaluation mechanisms where the test dataset remains concealed from the\nEvaluators is essential. Evaluators can prove to the system they correctly evaluated against the control dataset without accessing\nit, mitigating risks of misuse or leakage. Evaluators can be provided with high-quality, well-distributed, and highly representative\ncontrol datasets by the Model Owner. Evaluators can use this as a benchmark to evaluate each Participant's models as shown in\nFigure 6. The step-by-step protocol elaborates on the processes of Evaluators' involvement in the decentralized auditing\nprotocol within the rewards process, as illustrated in Figure 6, as follows:\n1. Model Owner selects secure computation method: a. Opens a TEE within the aggregation server, and/or b. Chooses\nalternative privacy-preserving computation meeting security standardsModel Owner distributes encrypted control\ndataset to chosen secure environment.\n2. Within secure environment: a. Evaluators compute performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) on models using\ncontrol dataset and benchmark using objective scoring metrics (i.e., Substra, Median Scoring [Blockflow]). b.\nEvaluators utilize remote attestation mechanisms to prove secure execution. c. Evaluators generate Zero-Knowledge\nProofs (ZKPs) for each metric.\n3. Contingency for MPC: a. Participants encrypt model updates using MPC or other privacy-preserving technique to\nbenchmark Participants' scores. b. Evaluator evaluates models on encrypted test dataset using privacy-preserving\nprotocol."}, {"title": "6. Threat Model", "content": "The papers threat model addresses potential risks in the federated learning (FL) process, ensuring robust security and privacy.\nThe protocol is resilient to up to 50% malicious participants, leveraging public/private key cryptography and a proof-of-stake\nconsensus mechanism. By using immutable storage on IPFS we ensure data integrity. Additionally, the use of Zero-Knowledge\nProofs (ZKPs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) mitigates risks associated with model evaluation and reward\ndistribution. This comprehensive approach ensures the security and reliability of the FL process, maintaining participant trust and\ndata sovereignty.\nFirstly, in an experiment with N agents, it is resistant up to M\u2208 [0, N/2) agents neglecting to follow the protocol for the\nexperiment to maintain its integrity [8]. For example, public/private key cryptography and a proof-of-stake consensus protocol\nsecure the Ethereum blockchain. Currently, there are no feasible attacks on the Ethereum Network, without controlling 50% of\nthe computational power of the entire Ethereum network and such an attack has never been successful on the Ethereum mainnet\n[31].\nSecondly, as a public blockchain is public and anonymous, clients could enroll multiple times in an experiment and thus have a\ndisproportionate participation. However, through decentralized identity verification, verifiable credentialing, or manual processes,\nagents can ensure that each other agent controls only one account [15], [32], [33].\nThird, IPFS is immutable, meaning agents cannot change their model after submitting the cryptographic hash to the smart\ncontract [26]. Like in BlockFlow, the DIN protocol requires each agent to report if it can load strictly more than N/2 models, and\nhave strictly more than N/2 agents report the same for their model. The DIN threat model guarantees that there are strictly more\nthan N/2 honest Participants. Additionally, as long as N/2 or more Evaluators who receive these models for evaluation are honest,\nwhich the DIN protocol guarantees, the system remains resistant to N/2 attacks. Since IPFS allows anyone to share any content,\none or more honest parties would share the model with all other Participants if they are unable to retrieve a model directly from\nthe source (e.g., due to firewall restrictions). Therefore, each Participant would still be able to obtain all necessary models [8],\n[26].\nFourth, there are several possible attacks on the contribution scoring procedure itself. Malicious models are those with weights\nthat do not reflect a truthful dataset, such as models trained on randomly generated data or inverted output features. Naively\naveraging such models into a global model would likely harm the shared objective. The DIN protocol can choose\ncontribution-scoring procedures that penalize those who submit malicious models. For instance, BlockFlow (2020) uses a\ncontributivity score system where lower scores result in less cryptocurrency received [8], [26]. In this system, any agent with an\nevaluation more than 0.5 away from the median score receives an overall score of 0 and no share of the cryptocurrency pool [8],\n[26]. This penalizes attempts to fabricate scores, as the protocol limits a Participant's overall score to the evaluation furthest from\nthe median [8], [26].\nFifth, Participants can collude during the training process to submit better models by secretly sharing raw data or models among\nM<N2 colluding Participants [8], [26]. The DIN protocol rewards Participants who contribute strong models, and it is acceptable\nfor multiple Participants to submit identical models. Such collusion is not considered an attack, as it is similar to having many\nParticipants with strong datasets [8], [26]. For attacks by Evaluators in the evaluation process, the I smart contract can use\nencryption and a commit-then-reveal protocol (e.g., Secret Sharing MPC, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman keys, etc.) to prevent\nEvaluators from copying others' scores without collusion [34]. If a minority subset of malicious Evaluators reports perfect 1.0\nscores for certain models and 0.0 scores for all others (e.g., models from honest agents), the median score is guaranteed to be\nbetween the minimum and maximum scores reported by the honest agents, as long as there are strictly fewer than half malicious\nEvaluators [8], [26]. Evaluators are incentivized to stake a native token to gain the right to evaluate Participant models in the\nrewards process within a proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystem. Evaluators found acting maliciously are slashed from the network,\nlosing some or all of their stake, thus maintaining network security and incentivizing honest work.\nSixth, in this papers threat model, it is crucial that the control dataset provided by the Model Owner remains encrypted to prevent\nits misuse. If the control dataset were accessible to colluding Participants, Model Owners, Evaluators, or other entities, they could\nexploit it to skew the reward distribution. For example, colluding parties could use the control dataset to strategically improve\ntheir model performance or manipulate evaluation outcomes to gain undeserved rewards. Encrypting the control dataset ensures\nthat it cannot be revealed or utilized by these entities to unfairly influence the results. To enhance security further, dual protection\nstrategies can be employed. For instance, the preferred scoring method, such as median scoring used by BlockFlow (2020), can\nbe integrated into the protocol [8]. In this approach, any score deviating significantly from the median-beyond a specified\nthreshold can be penalized. BlockFlow's method maps any score differing by more than 0.5 from the model's median to a score\nof 0, with an a priori score set at 0.5 [8]. This mechanism encourages evaluators to provide honest assessments by penalizing\nscores that deviate substantially from the median. This method helps mitigate the risk of anomalous scores due to collusion and\nmaintains fairness in the reward distribution process. Overall, encrypting the control dataset and employing robust scoring\nmechanisms collectively safeguard the integrity of the evaluation process and prevent potential manipulation by malicious actors."}, {"title": "7.

A number of studies have shown that such models propagate gender stereotypes, as well as geographical and racial bias, among other biases. While existing works tackle this issue by preprocessing data and debiasing embeddings, the proposed methods require a lot of computational resources and annotation effort while being limited to certain types of biases. To address these issues, we introduce REFINE-LM, a debiasing method that uses reinforcement learning to handle different types of biases without any fine-tuning. By training a simple model on top of the word probability distribution of a LM, our bias agnostic reinforcement learning method enables model debiasing without human annotations or significant computational resources. Experiments conducted on a wide range of models, including several LMs, show that our method (i) significantly reduces stereotypical biases while preserving LMs performance; (ii) is applicable to different types of biases, generalizing across contexts such as gender, ethnicity, religion, and nationality-based biases; and (iii) it is not expensive to train.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The success of (Large) Language Models (LMs) has led to a revolution in the domain of NLP, opening the door to numerous challenges. The emergence of LMs-based applications such as chatbots and text-based assistants with astounding capabilities has, on the one hand, sparked unprecedented enthusiasm within the research community [16, 36]. However, it has motivated ethical concerns and araised questions about the risks this technology may pose to society, particularly algorithmic fairness and the proliferation of harmful stereotypical bias. Indeed, several studies have shown that LMs suffer from stereotypical biases, which can be detected, for instance, through Implicit Association Tests (IATs) [7]. These biases are still prevalent in recent LLMs such as ChatGPT, GPT4, etc., [26, 40]. These findings ask for a thorough investigation of stereotypical bias in LMs, and for methods to mitigate their impact, perpetuation or even their exacerbation in various academic, societal and industrial applications.\nWhile some work has been proposed to mitigate bias in LMs, it remains challenging for several reasons. Firstly, metrics are highly task-dependent, i.e., quantifying stereotypical bias is highly dependent on the application at hand, meaning that the methods used to measure bias in LMs for one kind of bias can not be directly applied to other biases. For example, mitigation metrics for gender bias are typically not directly applicable to nationality-based or ethnic bias, e.g., gender bias mitigation relies on pronoun completion or the existence of sufficiently gendered phrases within corpora [8, 31, 47]. Secondly, even with adequate methods to measure bias, in practice, there is often a trade-off between bias mitigation and model performance [21], which can have a negative impact despite the bias removal. Namely, removing bias from a LM may risk deteriorating its performance on downstream applications such as question-answering [49]. Finally, most current approaches rely on either data debiasing or model fine-tuning, which have limitations. Data debiasing is not only highly application-dependent but also requires substantial manual annotation effort and significantly increased computational resources for retraining.\nThis paper proposes a new method for mitigating biases in pre-trained LMs that address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach involves a simple and efficient model that can be added on top of any pre-trained LM, which enables us to tackle bias using reinforcement learning by acting on the predictive probability distribution. When looking at such probability distributions it is important to avoid bias and prevent shallow heuristics of LMs [6]. For instance, if we take the first question in Figure 1, an LM such as BERT will predict John. This may seem like a random guess, but even after asking the same question multiple times, the answer remains the same. While considering the top-k predictions, we may assume that John and Mary would have similar probabilities. However, this is not the case since as the probability of predicting John is much higher than that of Mary, which reflect a gender bias problem. More example and analysis are provided in Section 2 of the supplementary material.\nTo this end, we reformulate bias mitigation as a reinforcement learning (RL) task, where a LM is considered a contextual bandit agent. At each step, the agent is presented with a set of context-based questions. The goal of the agent is to choose a set of actions, which in our case are a combination of answers, and maximize the cumulative"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "To investigate the presence or absence of bias in NLP models, the first step is to quantify that bias. In consequence, a plethora of works have historically focused on detecting and quantifying negative stereotypical biases on text embeddings [7, 31], and textual corpora [2, 37].\nAs argued by van der Wal et al. [44], measuring bias is challenging because it is an inherently interdisciplinary task, with its social and psychological aspects lying beyond the realm of computer science. While gender bias has traditionally received most attention [3, 43] \u2013 see the survey by Stanczak and Augenstein \u2013, more and more approaches are turning the attention towards other types of bias such as racial bias [32], religion-based [1] or political bias [30]. We refer the reader to the survey by et al. [15] for further details.\nIn the last years, the attention has shifted towards pre-trained LMs. As shown in [14, 49], LLMs tend to mirror their training data to reflect unfairness and under-representation. StereoSet [33] resorts to intra-sentence and inter-sentence CATs (Context Association Tests) to measure the likelihood of the LM to provide stereotypical and anti-stereotypical text completions. Nangia et al. [34] works in the same spirit by comparing the LM probabilities assigned to stereotypical and anti-stereotypical phrases. De Vassimon Manela et al. [8] use compound masked sentences from the WinoBias dataset [47] to define gender-occupation bias as the difference in the F1 score when predicting the right pronoun in stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences. However, Kaneko and Bollegala [25] has pointed out some of the limitations of these measuring frameworks. Recent works also consider [23] demographic categories, whereas [40] focuses on detecting bias in LLM generations and show that systemic bias is still present in ChatGPT and GPT4 across different social dimensions and demographics.\nUsing an alternate approach, the UnQover framework [27] quantifies bias via a set of under-specified masked questions and metrics that control for formulation biases in the input sentences. The goal of such techniques is to capture the \"pure\" stereotypical bias encoded in the LM. Unlike the other frameworks, UnQover supports several types of steoreotypical bias. Apart from measuring bias, several works have sought to mitigate it, either in a pre-, in-, or post-training fashion. An example of the first category is CDA\u00b9 [45] that augments the training corpus by flipping the polarity of gendered words and syntactic groups in the original training sentences. CDA works well for English but produces inadequate training examples for inflected languages such as Spanish. On those grounds, Zmigrod et al. [50] propose an approach \u2013 based on markov random fields \u2013 to deal with inflections in other parts of the sentence. Zhao et al. [48] learns gender-neutral word embeddings that encode gender information in a subset of the embedding components, trained to be orthogonal to the remaining components. In a different vibe, plenty of approaches have focused on debiasing word embeddings a posteriori [5, 10, 13].\nWhen it comes to LMs, pre- and in-training debiasing can be prohibitive. Hence, most works propose to fine-tune pre-trained language models. Mozafari et al. [32] mitigate racial bias by fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT via a proper re-weighting of the input samples. In a different vibe, Context-Debias [24] fine-tunes a pre-trained LM by forcing stereotype words and gender-specific words to be orthogonal in the latent space. Debias-BERT [19] resorts to equalizing and declustering losses to adjust BERT. Bias is evaluated by human annotators on the LM's answers for sentence completion and summarization tasks. A more recent effort [21] fine-tunes pre-trained LMs by minimizing the distributional disagreement between the completions for different values of the sensitive attribute, e.g., by minimizing the difference in the distribution of professions associated to male vs. female prompts. Albeit more efficient than full retraining,"}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "This section discusses our reinforcement based approach for mitigating biases in LMs. Our framework considers an LM as a contextual bandit agent and uses some reward functions to cope with bias. Our model, called REFINE-LM, involves a customized post-hoc debiasing network that could be placed on top of the majority of pre-trained LM. REFINE-LM is trained using reinforcement learning guided by the bias metrics from UnQover framework [27] to deal with any kind of bias. In the following, we first explain the UnQover framework and then detail the different components of our REFINE-LM model.\n3.1 UnQover Framework\nLi et al. [27] propose to measure bias in masked LMs by confronting the model with under-specified questions. These are question prompts that do not provide sufficient information for a right answer. The questions follow a template $\\tau$ that includes (i) two subjects $x_1$ and $x_2$ from a different group of gender, nationality, ethnicity, or religion; (ii) a context c such as \"sitting in a park\"; (iii) a stereotypical attribute a such as \"being a senator\" or \"looking like a criminal\"; and (iv) and a masked token as depicted in Example. 1.\nBy inspecting the probability distribution of the answers for the mask, one can spot reasoning errors induced by stereotypical biases. UnQover defines two basic types of reasoning bias: positional dependence and question independence. Consider a question of the form\n$\\tau_{1,2}(a) = [x_1] \\text{ } c \\text{ } [x_2]. \\text{ } [\\text{MASK}] \\text{ } [a],$"}, {"content": "where $(x_1, x_2) \\in X_1 \\times X_2$ are subject pairs that belong to two different disjoint categories $X_1$, $X_2$, $c \\in C$ is a context and $a \\in A$ is an attribute that usually carries a (negative) stereotype for one of the categories (see Example. 1). Let $S(x_1 | \\tau_{1,2}(a)) \\in [0, 1]$ denote the probability assigned by the LM to subject $x_1$ as a replacement for the mask. The positional dependence $\\delta$ and attribute independence $\\epsilon$ for a template $\\tau(a)$ are:\n$\\delta(\\tau_a(a)) = |S(x_1 | \\tau_{1,2}(a)) - S(x_1 | \\tau_{2,1}(a))|,$   (1)\nwhere $\\tau_{2,1}(a)$ denotes the same question as $\\tau_{1,2}(a)$ but with the order of $x_1$ and $x_2$ flipped, and\n$\\epsilon(\\tau(a)) = |S(x_1 | \\tau_{1,2}(a)) - S(x_2 | \\tau_{1,2}(\\overline{a}))|,$   (2)\nwhere $\\overline{a}$ is the negation of attribute a. For \"was a senator\", for instance, the negation could be \"was never a senator\". $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ measure the model's sensitivity to mere formulation aspects; hence, the closer to zero these scores are, the more robust the model actually is. To measure, or \u201cunqover\u201d, steoreotypical biases in LMs, Li et al. [27] define the subject-attribute bias:\n$\\text{B}(x_1 | x_2, \\text{T}^o(a)) = \\frac{1}{2} [S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(a)) + S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(a))] - [S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(\\overline{a})) + S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(\\overline{a}))].$   (3)\n$\\text{B}(x_1 | x_2, \\text{T}^o(a))$ quantifies the bias intensity of the model towards subject $x_1$ given another subject $x_2$ of a different category, e.g.,, a different gender or a different religion, in regards to the stereotypical attribute. The joint (also comparative) subject-attribute bias is therefore defined as:\n$C(\\tau(a)) = \\frac{1}{2} [\\text{B}(x_1 | x_2, \\tau(a)) \u2013 \\text{B}(x_2 | x_1, \\tau(a))].$   (4)\nIf the model is fair, $C(\u00b7) = 0$. If $C(\u00b7) > 0$, the model is biased towards $x_1$; otherwise, the bias is towards $x_2$. Given a set of templates $T(X_1, X_2, A)$, abbreviated $T$, UnQover defines the aggregate metrics subject-attribute bias $\\gamma$ and model bias intensity $\\mu$ as follows:\n$\\gamma(T) = \\underset{\\tau(a) \\in T}{\\text{avg}} C(\\tau(a))$   (5)\n$\\mu(T) = \\underset{a \\in A}{\\text{avg }} \\underset{X_1, X_2}{\\text{max}} |\\gamma(T(X_1, X_2, \\{a\\}))|$   (6)\n3.2 REFINE-LM Framework\nOur debiasing strategy consists of augmenting a pre-trained LM with a reinforcement learning model that takes the top-k elements of the LM output token distribution as input and returns a debiased distribution for those tokens. We focus on the top-k tokens (for some hyperparameter k), because those are of utility for applications. Also they"}, {"title": "3.2 Policy and Reward Function.", "content": "Given a fixed context c and a set of attributes $A \\in A$, an action $a_i \\in M$ consists in selecting a pair of subjects $(x_1, x_2) \\in X_1 \\times X_2$ such that when plugged into a template $\\tau(a) \\in T$ (for some a \u2208 A), the policy \u03c0 yields the highest probability. The policy \u3160 is the debiased LM, and the action's probability is defined by the highest token probability as follows:\n$\\text{max}\\{S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(a)), S(x_2 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(a)), S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(a)),\nS(x_2 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(a)), S(x_1 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(\\overline{a})), S(x_2 | \\text{T}_{1,2}(\\overline{a})),\nS(x_1 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(a)), S(x_2 | \\text{T}_{2,1}(\\overline{a})) \\}.$"}, {"content": "The reward r incurred by an action is given by\n$r(a_i) = -|C(\\tau(a))|.$   (7)\nNote first that the actions & with zero probability, i.e., those for which \u03c0(\u03b1) = 0, optimize the reward. However, such actions are not interesting because, for such cases, the LM prediction is outside the top-k tokens according to the original model (and very likely, different from 21 and 22). Secondly, we do not know a priori which actions maximize the reward. For this reason, at each step, the learning algorithm selects a batch $B^c(A) \\subset T(X_1, X_2, A)$ of question templates for fixed context c and attribute set A, whose reward vector $r_c$ is:\n$r_\\theta(B(A)) = -|C_\\theta(B(A))]|,$   (8)\nthat is, the agent's reward vector depends on the fairness of the augmented model's answers for each of the templates $\\tau(a) \\in B^c(A)$ in the batch.

Specifications about the LLMs that were used in our experiments are reported in the supplementary material (Table 1). The training data originates from the under-specified question templates provided by Li et al. [27]. Table 1 summarizes statistics about the templates representing the total number of available subjects, contexts, attributes, and groups provided in [27].\nIn order to create training and testing sets, we have generated new sets using the following approach: for all categories except gender, each group is associated with a single subject. For instance, when talking about American people, UnQover always uses the subject \"American\". Hence, we split the questions based on the set of distinct contexts, e.g., \"are sitting on a bench\" into training and testing. For gender there are two groups, namely male and female, hence the split is done at the level of subjects, i.e.,, the names. We provide a detailed overview of the datasets and the train-test splits in the supplementary material (Table 2) .\nGiven a category of bias, for instance, 'nationality', we measure the bias of the LM according to the metrics introduced in Subsection 3.1 - for all the combinations of two groups, e.g., German vs British, on the testing contexts. To verify whether the debiased language models retain their utility, we evaluate them on a specified question-answering task. We do so by turning the UnQover questions from the testing subset into specified questions so that the right answer is in the context."}, {"title": "4.1  Adaptation to LLMs.", "content": "With large LMs, similarly to Masked LMs, we turn the problem into infilling problem with few-shot learning using a 'BLANK' token instead of '[MASK]'.\nREFINE-LM only requires the last filtering layer to be trained. We thus freeze the layers from the base model, which makes REFINE-LM fast to train. Additionally, most of the applications only require a few top tokens for the downstream tasks. So one can decide which part of the top distribution to debias. We set k = 8 (the number of tokens to debias) as this value exhibits the best results among our different experiments and is quite practical as well. REFINE-LM took 4023 seconds for k = 8 on ROBERTa on the nationality dataset (our largest dataset), whereas for the gender dataset, it just took 718 seconds on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. For the experiments with LLAMA and Mistral, we set k = 10 and it took 17.4 hours (62656 seconds) with LlaMA 13b on the gender dataset with an NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n4.2 Results on Bias Intensity\nTable 7 shows the average positional error (Equation 1), attributive error (Equation 2), and bias intensity (Equation 6) of the three small LMs, namely, DistillBERT, BERT and ROBERTa, and three large LMS LLaMA2-7b, LLaMA2-13b and Mistral-7b with and without REFINE-LM. Additional experiments on different variant of LLMs such as LLaMA2-7b chat is given in supplementary material (Table 3). In all cases, lower values indicate reduced bias."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion and Perspectives", "content": "In this paper, we introduced the REFINE-LM approach to mitigate the stereotypical bias encoded in pre-trained LMs without hurting model performance. The proposed techniques make use of a large corpus of under-specified questions and reinforcement learning techniques to suppress different types of stereotypical bias in LMs, including gender-, nationality-, ethnicity-, and religion-based biases. Our evaluation results conducted on small and large language models open the door for further research avenues, which we envision to explore. Firstly, we envision to extend this empirical study to further bias datasets such as CrowS-pairs [34] and BBQ [35]. Secondly, we intend to carry out an extensive performance evaluation on different downstream tasks - e.g., conversational agents, text generation and summarization -, support for multilingual LMs, and efficient training of multiple bias types simultaneously.\n6 Limitations\nWhile we have shown that REFINE-LM can mitigate different types of bias, our current formulation can deal with one type of bias at a time. A simple way to solve this issue could be to stack different debiasing layers, however this is not computationally efficient. Dealing with different kinds of bias in a simultaneous fashion could help reducing the complexity of the debiasing architecture. Conversely this poses additional challenges at training because an LM may be more intensely gender-biased than religion-biased. Such imbalance should be taken into account by the template selection and and parameter update strategies.\n7 Ethical Considerations\nThe evaluation of REFINE-LM shows that our debiasing layer can drastically reduce the stereotypical bias by the considered models. That said, the results should be taken with a grain of salt when it comes to deploying such a technique in a real-world scenario. To see why, the reader must take into account that REFINE-LM defines bias according to the metrics proposed by [27]. Although the utility of those metrics has been validated by the scientific community, users of REFINE-LM should make sure that this definition of stereotypical bias is indeed compatible with their requirements and ethical expectations. Moreover, the bias measures used only reflect some indicators of undesirable stereotypes and users should avoid using REFINE-LM as proof or as a guarantee that their models are unbiased without extensive study [20, 9].\nWhile the bias intensity achieved by REFINE-LM is usually very close to zero (i.e., close to a perfectly unbiased model), it will unlikely be equal to zero. This means that applications of REFINE-LM should not blindly rely on the most likely token output by the model, because this answer may still preserve a slight stereotypical bias. Instead, applications could smooth the bias by exploiting the top-k tokens in order to guarantee unbiased answers on average.\nAs a final remark, users and practitioners should be aware of the considerable financial and carbon footprints of training and experimenting with LMs [4], and should limit their massive usage to reasonable amounts."}, {"title": "8 Acknowledgements", "content": "This work has been supported by ANR-22-CE23-0002 ERIANA, ANR-23-IAS1-0004-01 InExtenso and by the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre, ADAPT at Trinity College Dublin."}, {"title": "A Some motivating examples", "content": "In the following, we give additional examples to illustrate stereotypical biases in GPT3.5, GPT4, Llama-2 70b (llama2.ai) and Mistral.\nA.1 GPT 3.5\nWe use the following prompt and ask the same question 10 times.

Introduction", "content": "The escalating incidence of cancer worldwide necessitates the advancement of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies that can enhance the precision and personalization of cancer care. The integration of diagnostic imaging with targeted therapy, as exemplified by molecular theranostics, has emerged as a pivotal strategy in delivering personalized treatment with enhanced accuracy. Within this domain, the conjunction of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) plays a critical role in the diagnostic arsenal for oncological applications. The deployment of radiotracers such as Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in PET/CT imaging has been instrumental in the effective detection and management of various cancer types. FDG PET/CT is particularly adept at highlighting metabolically active cancer cells, facilitating the evaluation of multiple cancer entities (Dholakia et al., 2014). Similarly, the high expression of PSMA in prostate cancer cells underscores its diagnostic and therapeutic relevance, making it a valuable target for both imaging and therapeutic interventions (Nickols et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2019). The incorporation of deep learning (DL) techniques into PET/CT imaging has significantly enhanced the accuracy of lesion segmentation. DL models have facilitated the delineation of lesions in FDG PET/CT imaging, addressing the challenges associated with distinguishing pathological changes from physiological uptake in organs such as the liver and brain (Im et al., 2017). Advances in multi-label segmentation methodologies have further improved the precision of lesion delineation by enabling the concurrent identification of lesions and organs with high radiotracer uptake (Weisman et al., 2020; Barrington et al., 2020). In the context of PSMA PET imaging, DL has become increasingly vital for the early detection of lymph node metastases and for monitoring therapeutic responses, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional imaging modalities (Fr\u00fch et al., 2021; Anttinen et al., 2021). Despite these advancements, the scarcity of publicly available PET data presents"}, {"title": "2. Methods", "content": "The automated lesion segmentation process for FDG and PSMA PET images consists of two steps. First, a YOLOv8 model was trained for tracer classification of PET medical images. Second, two 3d Unets were trained independently with FDG or PSMA data for lesion segmentation."}, {"title": "2.1 Data and preprocessing", "content": "The training of the FDG models was conducted using whole-body FDG-PET/CT data from a cohort of 900 patients, encompassing 1014 studies supplied by the AutoPET challenge III in 2024. The challenge consists of patients with malignant melanoma, lymphoma, lung cancer and negative control patients. The data was split into a training set of 810 cases and a testing set of 204 cases. For the PSMA model, 600 PSMA-PET/CT data supplied by the AutoPET challenge III was split into a training set of 479 cases and a testing set of 121 cases. Lesion numbers and patient meta info were taken into consideration to ensure that both the training and testing subsets exhibited equitable distributions of lesion counts.\n\nThe preprocessing steps includes resampling to achieve uniform spatial spacing and intensity normalization. AutoPET III provides a default robust data augmentation pipeline to enrich the training dataset, incorporating spatial and intensity transformations. Random cropping and affine transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) simulated spatial variations, while Gaussian noise, smoothing, and sharpening techniques accounted for image quality diversity. Intensity adjustments included random scaling and contrast variations, both inverted and non-inverted. Random flipping along spatial axes further increased data variability, aiming to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. The details of default preprocessing steps and data augmentation pipline could be found at. We further tested influence of non-zero normalization, ClipValMax=280 (clip intensity>280 for PET image). Whether adding RandGaussianSharpen to data augmentation pipline or change the parameter (\u03b3) of Gamma transform to 1-1.5 (defualt y = 0.7 \u2013 1.5) could enhance segmentation results would be also evaluated."}, {"title": "2.2 Model architecture and training", "content": "The automated lesion segmentation process for FDG and PSMA PET images consists of two steps.

Results", "content": "The outcomes of this investigation highlight the efficacy of various preprocessing and data augmentation strategies on the segmentation performance of FDG and PSMA tracers (shown in Table.1). For the FDG tracer, the default settings yielded a Dice coefficient of 63.19%, indicating moderate segmentation precision. In contrast, the PSMA tracer under default conditions presented a Dice score of 32.07%, with notable false positive volumes, suggesting that the baseline approach is suboptimal for this tracer.\n\nEnhancements in segmentation were observed when Gaussian sharpening was applied as a data augmentation technique, resulting in a Dice score of 44.55% for the PSMA tracer and 64.11% for the FDG tracer, accompanied by a reduction in false positive volumes. The most significant improvement was achieved with a max clip value of 280 in preprocessing combined with Gaussian sharpening, which elevated the Dice score to 53.69% and minimized false positive volume to 5.55 cm\u00b3 and 15.28 cm\u00b3, respectively."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we compared segmentation results among different preprocessing steps and data augmentation methods.

In educational KT scenarios, transductive ID-based methods often face severe data sparsity and cold start problems, where interactions between individual students and questions are sparse, and new questions and concepts consistently arrive in the database. In addition, existing KT models only implicitly consider the correlation between concepts and questions, lacking direct modeling of the more complex relationships in the heterogeneous graph of concepts and questions. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware INductive Knowledge Tracing model with large language model (dubbed SINKT), which, for the first time, introduces large language models (LLMs) and realizes inductive knowledge tracing. Firstly, SINKT utilizes LLMs to introduce structural relationships between concepts and constructs a heterogeneous graph for concepts and questions. Secondly, by encoding concepts and questions with LLMs, SINKT incorporates semantic information to aid prediction. Finally, SINKT predicts the student's response to the target question by interacting with the student's knowledge state and the question representation. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SINKT achieves state-of-the-art performance among 12 existing transductive KT models. Additionally, we explore the performance of SINKT on the inductive KT task and provide insights into various modules.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\u00b9 and Khan Academy\u00b2, are garnering increasing attention from learners due to the extensive learning resources and real-time feedback mechanisms. Knowledge Tracing (KT) stands out as a vital area of research within ITS, which aims to assess the current knowledge states of students by analyzing their learning histories and to predict their responses to upcoming questions. KT not only helps to identify deficiencies in student's learning content but also provides a foundational basis for the subsequent instruction strategies in ITS.\nExisting KT models originate from traditional methods repre-sented by BKT [6] and have evolved significantly with the advent of models based on deep neural networks. Deep learning-based KT models learn ID embeddings for questions and concepts through learning history of students. DKT [33] and DHKT [41] utilize Re-current Neural Networks (RNNs) [34] to capture the sequential information of learning history.

Some work [22-24, 46] apply LLMs as profilers to involve the creation of prompts based on users' history, and input these prompts into LLMs to generate various aspects of user profiles. KAR [43] leverages LLMs to generate user and item profiles, encompassing user preference and real-world knowledge of items into click-through rate (CTR) prediction task. GIRL [53] uses LLMs to generate suitable job descriptions base on the user's curriculum vitae to help recommendation model under-stand jobhunter's preferences. In addition to profiling, LLMs serve as feature encoders, translating raw user data into rich, seman-tic embeddings that improve user modeling systems [19, 32, 43]. GPT4SM [32] employs GPT to encode queries and candidate text for relevance prediction in recommendation systems, and LKPNR [13] uses open-source LLMs for better semantic representation of news articles. Moreover, LLMs function as knowledge augmenters by integrating external knowledge into user models [3, 9, 18, 20, 43], thus enhancing the precision of user-related predictions. Mysore et al. [28] augment narrative-driven recommendations by generat-ing author narrative queries with LLMs, and KAR [43] uses LLM-prompted outputs to augment recommender systems with factual item knowledge.\nExisting LLM-enhanced user modeling methods are mostly ap-plied in the domain of recommender systems, which significantly from the KT task. In recommender systems, users' interests typically remain stable over short periods, whereas in ITS, the knowledge states of students evolve dynamically as they engage with edu-cational contents such as exercises.

The vertex set $\\mathcal{V}$ includes the question set $\\mathcal{Q}$ and the concept set $\\mathcal{C}$, and The vertex type set $\\mathcal{O}_v$ includes concept and question cor-respondingly.

The graph $\\mathcal{G}$ not only encapsulates the relationships between questions and con-cepts contained in the dataset but also incorporates open-world knowledge provided by LLMs.\nconcept-question edges and question-concept edges are derived from the dataset. Each question $q_i$ corresponds to one or more concepts $\\mathcal{C}_{q_i} = \\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n_i}\\}$, and each concept $c_i$ corresponds to many questions $\\mathcal{Q}_{c_i} = \\{q_1, q_2, ..., q_{m_i}\\}$, where $n_i$ and $m_i$ denotes the number of concepts related to the question $q_i$ and the number of questions related to the concept $c_i$, respectively.

As demonstrated in Figure 2, for each concept $c_i$, we employ a specific prompt and utilize GPT-4 [30] to identify a list of related concepts. [10, 17] suggest that LLMs struggle with tasks directly involving graph structures, often requiring specialized training or input transformation to handle graph structures. Therefore, we opt to use a \"select from the list\" approach rather than asking GPT-4 to directly generate the graph. After GPT-4 generates the response, we use the regular expression extraction to get $p_i$ concepts related to $c_i$, and add the directed edges $(c_j, c_i)(j = 1, 2, ..., p_i)$ into the graph $\\mathcal{G}$."}, {"title": "4 METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this section, we will introduce our method in detail, and the over-all framework is shown in Figure 3.

The mas-tery of both the target concept and its related concepts, as well as the related questions, can provide valuable information for the assessment of KT models. Therefore, the three types of edges in the heterogeneous graph $\\mathcal{G}$, i.e., concept-question, concept-concept, and question-concept, are considered by SINKT. To encode such structural information, we carefully design a multi-layer heteroge-neous graph encoder.\nIn the graph $\\mathcal{G}$, denote neighbor questions of the concept $c_i$ as $N_i^q$ and $N_i^c$, respectively. The set of neighbor concepts of the question $q_i$ is denoted as $N_{q_i}$. We apply three different Graph At-tention Networks (GAT) to aggregate neighborhood information for vertexes. Concept-Concept GAT layer fuse neighbor concept representations of the target concept $c_i$. Specifically, the Concept-Concept GAT can be expressed as:\n$\\alpha_{i,j}^{cc} = \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{cc}^T(x_i^c \\oplus x_j^c)\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{c_k \\in N_i^c} \\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{cc}^T(x_i^c \\oplus x_k^c)\\right)\\right)}$,\n$\\tilde{e_i^c} = \\sum_{c_j \\in N_i^c} \\alpha_{i,j}^{cc} (W_{cc}x_j^c)$,\nwhere $W_{cc}$ is the aggregate weight, $a_{cc}^T$ is the attention weight, $\\oplus$ denotes concatenate operation. Similarly, Concept-Concept GAT integrate neighbor concept information to the target concept:\n$\\alpha_{i,j}^{cq} = \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{cq}^T(x_i^c \\oplus x_j^q)\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{q_k \\in N_i^q} \\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{cq}^T(x_i^c \\oplus x_k^q)\\right)\\right)}$,\n$\\tilde{e_i^c} = \\sum_{q_j \\in N_i^q} \\alpha_{i,j}^{cq} (W_{qc}x_j^q)$,\nand Question-Concept GAT integrate neighbor concept information to the target concept:\n$\\alpha_{i,j}^{qc} = \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{qc}^T(x_i^q \\oplus x_j^c)\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_{q_k \\in N_{q_i}} \\exp \\left(\\text{LeakyReLU} \\left(a_{qc}^T(x_i^q \\oplus x_k^c)\\right)\\right)}$,\n$\\tilde{e_i^q} = \\sum_{q_j \\in N_{q_i}} \\alpha_{i,j}^{qc} (W_{cq}x_j^c)$.\nTo emphasize the semantic information inherent in concepts and questions themselves, SINKT introduces jumping knowledge [45] to propagate the vertex original representations. The node repre-sentation of $l$-th encoder layer of can be represented as:\n$x_c^{(l)} = \\text{ReLU} (W_c (x_c^{(l-1)} + \\tilde{e_i^c} + \\tilde{e_i^c}))$,\n$x_q^{(l)} = \\text{ReLU} (W_q (W_qx_q^{(l-1)} + \\tilde{e_i^q}))$,\nwhere $W_c$ and $W_q$ are trainable weight matrix for concepts and questions.

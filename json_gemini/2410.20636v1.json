{"title": "LANGUAGE MODELS AND A SECOND OPINION USE CASE: THE POCKET PROFESSIONAL", "authors": ["David Noever"], "abstract": "This research tests the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as formal second opinion tools in professional decision-making, particularly focusing on complex medical cases where even experienced physicians seek peer consultation. The work analyzed 183 challenging medical cases from Medscape over a 20-month period (2023-2024), testing multiple LLMs' performance against crowd-sourced physician responses. A key finding was the high overall score possible in the latest foundational models (>80% accuracy compared to consensus opinion), which exceeds most human metrics reported on the same clinical cases (450 pages of patient profiles, test results and treatment recommendations). The study rates the LLMs' performance disparity between straightforward cases (>81% accuracy) and complex scenarios (43% accuracy), particularly in these cases generating substantial debate among human physicians. The study's focus on text-based responses does not fully attempt to capture the multimodal nature of medical diagnosis in these \"human-hard\u201d cases. However, the research demonstrates that LLMs may be valuable as generators of comprehensive differential diagnoses rather than as primary diagnostic tools, potentially helping to counter cognitive biases in clinical decision-making, reduce cognitive loads and thus remove some sources of medical error. The inclusion of a second comparative legal dataset (Supreme Court cases, N=21) provides added empirical context to the AI use to foster second opinions, though these legal challenges proved considerably easier for LLMs to analyze. In addition to the original contributions of empirical evidence for LLM accuracy, the research aggregated a novel benchmark for others to score highly contested question and answer reliability between both LLMs and disagreeing human practitioners.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Recent workers have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) into professional workflows, primarily as assistants for routine tasks such as documentation, summarization, and information retrieval [1-15]. While LLMs have performed well on medical licensing exams, this passing grade may mask the complexity gap between test-taking and real-world clinical reasoning. The structured nature of board examinations, with their carefully curated answer spaces and well-defined problem boundaries, presents a fundamentally different challenge from the open-ended, nuanced differential diagnoses encountered in daily medical practice. This paper explores this distinction experimentally by examining cases where even experienced physicians seek peer consultation through professional forums like Medscape-cases that often defy traditional diagnostic frameworks and challenge the boundaries of medical consensus. We extend the second-opinion framework to a Supreme Court legal dataset for generality and comparison. The original contributions of the work therefore include the empirical assessment of the second-opinion paradigm for Al utility along with two new human-rated professional datasets that require reasoning nuance beyond traditional licensing examinations."}, {"title": "2. METHODS", "content": "Our research focuses on these \"human-hard\" cases: clinical scenarios where the pathway to diagnosis remains ambiguous enough to prompt practicing physicians to seek crowdsourced wisdom. By analyzing hundreds of such cases from professional medical forums alongside LLM responses to the same scenarios, we test both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence in navigating medical uncertainty. The results suggest that while LLMs may not replace human clinical judgment, they could serve a unique role in augmenting decision-making processes, particularly in gray areas where multiple interpretations of available evidence exist.\nThis investigation challenges the current paradigm of positioning LLMs primarily as automation tools for routine medical tasks. Instead, we propose a framework for deploying these systems as specialized agents for second opinions, particularly in scenarios where traditional diagnostic approaches have reached their limits. Our findings suggest that the true value of LLMs in medicine may lie not in their ability to replicate standard medical knowledge, but in their capacity to systematically explore the gaps and uncertainties that characterize real-world clinical practice.\nThe literature on large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has primarily focused on evaluating their performance as diagnostic tools, educational aids, and participants in medical exams. Studies have assessed ChatGPT's diagnostic utility for both clinicians and students, as well as its effectiveness compared to traditional online symptom checkers and triage apps, providing a foundation for understanding its role in clinical settings [1-4]. A significant body of research has explored ChatGPT's ability to pass medical licensing and specialty exams across various countries and domains, including China, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom [5-17]. These evaluations highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs, emphasizing variability across different models and exam types [7-12].\nRecent systematic reviews and meta-analyses consolidate findings from multiple studies, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs across diverse testing scenarios [7, 18-21, 28]. While ChatGPT has shown some success in exams like family medicine [22], it has also encountered notable challenges, such as failing Taiwan's family medicine board exam [17]. Moreover, discussions on LLM performance have expanded to include ensemble learning approaches, which suggest that combining multiple models may enhance reasoning capabilities and reliability in medical question answering [24-25].\nLLMs are increasingly viewed not as standalone diagnostic agents but as complementary tools that alleviate cognitive load and bridge knowledge gaps. This application reflects the shift toward integrating LLMs into collaborative workflows, where they act as advisory systems rather than autonomous decision-makers [26- 27]. The current study builds on this evolving perspective by examining how LLMs function as second- opinion guides, distinct from fully autonomous agents, thereby focusing on their ability to assist medical professionals without replacing clinical oversight in dataset development [29-31]. This approach aligns with recent trends, aiming to enhance the decision-making process through Al-supported collaboration rather than substitution.\nOur study analyzed case challenges from Medscape's professional forum [29,31] over a 20-month period from January 2023 through October 2024. This timeframe yielded real-world 183 challenging cases, representing approximately one case every three days. Each case consisted of detailed clinical presentations submitted by practicing physicians seeking diagnostic consultation, with an average length of several pages of text. Cases included two multiple-choice questions with corresponding crowd-sourced responses from the medical community [31]. This specific timeframe was selected to address potential training data"}, {"title": "3. RESULTS", "content": "The challenge cases showed significant spread among human physicians in the test itself, prior to including LLM choices. Applying the entropy (information content) metric for the opinion differences (spread), 74.7% (272/364 case questions) ranked as either \u201csomewhat ambiguous\u201d (45.9%) or \u201cmoderately ambiguous\" (28%). The \u201cvery ambiguous\" (13.7%) compared roughly equivalent to the \u201cclear consensus\" (10.7%). This spread in opinion should not surprise since the challenge cases are selected for their difficulty to a community practicing differential diagnosis. No notation in Medscape challenges indicate whether a particular specialist opinion might hold more weight in reported answers (although that pathway dominates the likely real-world scenarios where a difficult case travels from a generalist to a specialist).\nAnalysis of the 183 case challenges and 361 (viable) questions revealed significant disparities between LLM performance on straightforward diagnostic scenarios versus complex cases that prompted physician forum consultation in Figures 4-5. While foundational large models demonstrated high accuracy (>81%) in matching physician consensus on cases with clear diagnostic criteria, performance declined markedly (43%) in scenarios characterized by atypical presentations or competing diagnostic possibilities in Figure 5. Notably, cases that generated substantial debate in physician forums showed the lowest LLM consensus matching (44%). The study defines disagreement as <1.2 ratio between first and second consensus answer as its metric for disagreement in crowd-sourced responses which represent the most difficult 25 human- hard questions."}, {"title": "4. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "Our findings measure LLMs' ability to process medical information and their capacity to replicate the nuanced decision-making of experienced clinicians. While previous research has emphasized these models' success on standardized medical examinations, our analysis of real-world clinical challenges reveals potential uses in their diagnostic reasoning, particularly in cases that human physicians find sufficiently complex to warrant peer consultation.\nThe consistent performance degradation across all models in cases requiring ambiguity points to a fundamental limitation in current language model architectures. However, this limitation reveals an unexpected strength: the models' capacity to generate expansive differential diagnoses often exceeded the scope considered by individual human clinicians. This synthetic breadth suggests parallels with ongoing debates about Al creativity and invention, where the ability to systematically explore possibility spaces may compensate for lack of intuitive understanding. Just as these systems can generate novel technical solutions by exhaustively exploring design spaces, they appear capable of surfacing diagnostic possibilities that might be overlooked by human practitioners constrained by cognitive limitations or practice patterns.\nParticularly significant is the models' immunity to common cognitive biases that affect human clinical reasoning. Unlike human clinicians who may be unduly influenced by recent cases (recency bias) or seek information that confirms initial impressions (confirmation bias), LLMS consistently generated comprehensive differential diagnoses regardless of context. We removed model memory in a chat context by prompting each question independently within the vendor's API. This systematic approach to diagnostic consideration, while lacking the intuitive depth of human expertise, offers a valuable counterbalance to the psychological factors that can compromise clinical decision-making. The reduction in cognitive load afforded by automated differential diagnosis generation may allow clinicians to focus their expertise on evaluation and integration rather than initial possibility generation. While a human might spend 2-3 days answering 361 challenging questions, the LLMs can complete the same test in less than an hour.\nThe light correlation between model performance and physician ambiguity raises interesting \"second opinion\" considerations for clinical implementation. Unlike human physicians, who often express uncertainty in complex cases and seek consultation, current models lack reliable internal calibration of their diagnostic confidence. This disconnect could pose risks in clinical settings where model outputs might be mistaken for authoritative rather than advisory input. But when human professionals gauge their doubt, they typically defer a patient to specialists or seek a second opinion. The role for a LLM consultant in this instance thus offers a novel approach to the copilot or personal assistant. Thus, this inability to respond with \"I don't know\u201d as a limitation also suggests a natural role for these systems in augmenting rather than replacing human decision-making, particularly in generating difficult or expanded differential diagnoses for consideration by human clinicians.\nOur results suggest that the optimal deployment of LLMs in clinical settings may differ substantially from current approaches that emphasize automation of routine tasks. Instead, these systems may prove most valuable in their capacity to serve as systematic, tireless generators of diagnostic possibilities, particularly in complex cases where broadening the consideration set could help prevent diagnostic anchoring or premature closure. This role as agents of second opinion rather than primary diagnosis aligns more closely with both the demonstrated strengths and limitations of current language model architectures, while potentially reducing the impact of cognitive biases that can affect human clinical reasoning. This role also extends current medical testing of LLMs beyond simple licensing or certification stages and opens up inventive supplemental advice when even the most dedicated professionals might disagree.\nFurther investigation is needed to explore several key areas emerging from our findings. First, the development of specialized prompting strategies that better elicit clinically relevant pattern recognition warrants investigation, particularly approaches that might help bridge the gap between algorithmic and experiential knowledge. Additionally, research into methods for improving model confidence calibration could enhance their utility in clinical settings. For example, we did not attempt to do few-shot learning where a worked example can guide a LLM to a solution better than zero-shot learning where the prompt presents the question cold without additional hints or templated guidance. A longitudinal study tracking how model performance evolves with the integration of more recent medical literature and case studies could provide insights into the role of training data temporality in clinical reasoning capabilities. Retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) models specialize diagnostic hints into the pre-prompting of many expert systems.\nThe interaction between human clinicians and LLM-generated second opinions represents another crucial area for investigation. Studies examining how physicians integrate model-generated differential diagnoses into their clinical reasoning process could inform more effective implementation strategies. Furthermore, research into the potential of these systems to serve as educational tools for medical trainees, particularly in developing systematic approaches to differential diagnosis, could reveal additional valuable applications.\nA targeted future research priority lies in quantifying the cognitive load reduction afforded by LLM-assisted differential diagnosis. As noted, a human reader could not absorb the clinical text except over multiple exhausting 8-hour days of continuous and relentless examination. The LLM on the other hand can respond in 10-100 times less time and thus trigger the human reader to confirm rather than decide the case verdicts. The cognitive load could further be quantified through a controlled study measuring physicians' cognitive resources using established metrics such as NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scores, eye-tracking patterns, and physiological stress indicators when approaching complex cases with and without LLM support. Time- motion analysis could track the allocation of cognitive resources across different diagnostic tasks, while standardized documentation of diagnostic pathways could reveal whether access to LLM-generated differential diagnoses allows physicians to devote more attention to critical thinking and case synthesis rather than initial hypothesis generation. Complementary qualitative research using structured interviews and think-aloud protocols could illuminate how clinicians integrate LLM suggestions into their cognitive workflow. Of particular interest would be measuring decision fatigue across sequential cases, testing the hypothesis that LLM assistance might help maintain consistent diagnostic thoroughness throughout long clinical shifts. Additionally, investigating the relationship between cognitive load reduction and diagnostic accuracy could help establish optimal integration points for LLM assistance in clinical workflows, potentially identifying specific case types or clinical scenarios where automated differential generation provides maximum benefit with minimal disruption to established clinical reasoning patterns."}, {"title": "5. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "Our analysis of LLM performance on challenging clinical cases reveals both important limitations and promising opportunities in the application of these technologies to medical diagnosis. While current models fall short of replicating the nuanced clinical reasoning of experienced physicians, they demonstrate potential value as systematic generators of diagnostic possibilities, particularly in complex cases where broadening the differential diagnosis could be beneficial.\nThe clear distinction between model performance on standardized examinations versus real-world clinical challenges suggests that current evaluation metrics for medical AI systems may need recalibration. Rather than pursuing direct replacement of human clinical judgment, our findings support a more nuanced role for these technologies as augmentative tools in the diagnostic process. The identified limitations in pattern recognition and experiential knowledge integration, rather than disqualifying these systems from clinical use, help define their most appropriate role: as agents of second opinion rather than primary diagnostic tools.\nThese results suggest that the near-term future of medical AI may lie not in autonomous diagnosis but in the integration of machine-generated insights into human clinical reasoning processes. By positioning LLMs as partners in diagnostic consideration rather than arbiters of diagnostic truth, we may better leverage their capabilities while acknowledging their limitations. This approach aligns with the fundamental goal of medical technology: not to replace human judgment, but to enhance it in service of improved patient care."}]}

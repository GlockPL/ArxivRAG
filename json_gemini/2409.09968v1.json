While millions of chest CT scans are\nperformed annually in the United States, CAC is not routinely quantified from scans done for non-cardiac purposes.\nA deep learning algorithm was developed using 446 expert segmentations to automatically quantify CAC on non-\ncontrast, non-gated CT scans (AI-CAC). Our study differs from prior works as we leverage imaging data across the\nVeterans Affairs national healthcare system, from 98 medical centers, capturing extensive heterogeneity in imaging\nprotocols, scanners, and patients. AI-CAC performance on non-gated scans was compared against clinical standard\nECG-gated CAC scoring. Non-gated AI-CAC differentiated zero vs. non-zero and less than 100 vs. 100 or greater\nAgatston scores with accuracies of 89.4% (F1 0.93) and 87.3% (F1 0.89), respectively, in 795 patients with paired\ngated scans within a year of a non-gated CT scan. Non-gated AI-CAC was predictive of 10-year all-cause mortality\n(CAC 0 vs. >400 group: 25.4% vs. 60.2%, Cox HR 3.49, p < 0.005), and composite first-time stroke, MI, or death\n(CAC 0 vs. >400 group: 33.5% vs. 63.8%, Cox HR 3.00, p < 0.005). In a screening dataset of 8,052 patients with\nlow-dose lung cancer-screening CTs (LDCT), 3,091/8,052 (38.4%) individuals had AI-CAC >400. Four\ncardiologists qualitatively reviewed LDCT images from a random sample of>400 AI-CAC patients and verified that\n527/531 (99.2%) would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-gated\nCT CAC algorithm developed across a national healthcare system, on multiple imaging protocols, without filtering\nintra-cardiac hardware, and compared against a strong gated CT reference. We report superior performance relative\nto previous CAC algorithms evaluated against paired gated scans that included patients with intra-cardiac hardware.", "sections": [{"title": "Background:", "content": "Atherosclerosis, the fundamental driver of cardiovascular disease, progresses over decades before patients present\nwith clinical symptoms, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The natural history of atherosclerosis offers a unique\nopportunity for early detection and treatment, allowing a physician to slow the progression towards irreversible\nadverse events.\u00b9 Traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk calculators use age, lipid levels,\nblood pressure, diabetes diagnosis, and smoking status to help physicians determine whether to place a patient on\nlipid-lowering medications for primary prevention. These calculators offer limited predictive power, and evolving\nevidence shows that imaging of plaque is a superior predictor of who would most benefit from the early initiation of\nthese therapies.\u00b2\nCoronary artery calcium quantification on ECG-gated CT scans by the Agatston formula is a well-\nestablished method of determining atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk.\u00b3 Since its proposal in the 1990s, Agatston\nscoring of coronary calcium has demonstrated utility in predicting all-cause mortality and major adverse\ncardiovascular events (MACE). This has been confirmed in longitudinally followed patient cohorts, such as the\nMulti-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).\u2074 Recent AHA/ACC guidelines recommend the use of coronary\ncalcium scoring to help reclassify patients with borderline cardiovascular risk, and the use of cardiac CT is an\nevolving area in medical practice as scanner technology improves and interpretation skills disseminate.\u2075 While\nECG-gated CTs remain the gold standard for quantifying coronary artery calcium, most chest CT scans obtained for\nroutine clinical purposes are not ECG-gated, meaning they are not electrocardiographically synchronized to\nheartbeat to reduce cardiac motion during the scan. While non-ECG gated CT scans have relatively poor cardiac\nanatomy definition due to cardiac motion, physicians can often review these studies qualitatively to identify\ncoronary calcium, which may inform the decision to start a patient on lipid-lowering therapies. Prior studies have\nshown high correlation between manually derived CAC scores from non-gated studies compared to gated studies,\nand a meta-analysis reported a pooled correlation coefficient of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.97).\u2076\nVarious research groups have investigated the potential application of deep learning algorithms towards the\nautomation of coronary calcium scoring on non-gated ECG studies.\u2077,8,9,10,11,12,13 Coronary calcium has a distinctive\nvisual appearance on CT and is labeled with low inter-reader variability, making it a particularly tractable problem\nfor modern deep learning segmentation algorithms. Zelesnik et al. showed that these automated CAC scores from\nnon-gated studies predict outcomes across a variety of large symptomatic and asymptomatic patient cohorts. Eng et\nal. expanded on this problem by benchmarking their non-ECG gated AI predictions against paired ECG-gated CTs\nand exploring an end-to-end neural network architecture that directly segments coronary calcification without first\nrequiring cardiac segmentation.10 More recently, initial prospective testing of these models in clinical settings has\nbegun, but these systems are not disseminated in widespread clinical practice and have yet to become part of routine\nclinical care.14 Limitations in prior studies using AI to quantify CAC from non-gated CT scans include: not testing\nagainst a strong gated CT CAC-scoring standard, testing on a single CT protocol, testing on a limited number of\nmedical centers, and not being trained or evaluated on patients with intracardiac hardware.\nBuilding upon previous Al coronary calcium scoring studies, we developed and evaluated our own AI\nmodel within the Veterans Affairs national healthcare system, using data from 98 distinct medical centers across the\nUnited States. The VA was one of the first healthcare systems to adopt electronic medical records systems in the\n1990s and has excellent patient retention longitudinally because it serves as a single-payer healthcare network for 14\nmillion veterans. This results in an ideal dataset for developing predictive models, as long-term outcome, diagnosis,\nand medication information are available across an extensive network of hospitals. We use a diverse set of non-\ngated CT imaging protocols as input for our AI-CAC model and compare its predicted CAC scores against the\nreference standard of gated-CT CAC scoring. Additionally, we did not filter out intracardiac hardware, which makes\nCAC quantification more challenging. Relative to prior works, we chose to create challenging datasets to develop a\nmodel that would be more robust to real-world clinical variation."}, {"title": "Methods:", "content": "This research was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant and approved by local Institutional\nReview Boards and Research and Development Committees.

This cohort\nconstruction methodology was similar to Eng et al. but we used a narrower time window between our gated- and\nnon-gated CT pairs to further limit coronary calcium progression between scans. 10,15 Only scans obtained prior to\nJanuary 1st, 2020 were selected to increase follow-up duration and avoid any potential impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on model development. Patient clinical outcomes were collected to an end-point of May 1st, 2024. This\nprocess identified 10,265 paired CT studies (4,179 gated, 6,086 non-gated) from 4,063 distinct patients. Due to\nlimitations in mapping from internal SQL databases to the VA's internal VistA Imaging platform, the retrieval\nprocess yielded only 8,499 of the requested paired studies. Of the retrieved studies, 7,182 scans from 3,595 patients\npassed quality filtering removing non-chest anatomy, contrast, post-processed studies, non-axial series, and filtering\nto slice thicknesses of 2.5 mm to 5 mm.

Furthermore, this predictive ability generalized to 48 medical centers\nnot present in the training dataset. At present, VA imaging storage systems contain millions of non-gated, non-\ncontrast chest CTs, but less than fifty thousand gated studies. This asymmetry represents an opportunity for AI-CAC\nto leverage routinely collected non-gated scans for purposes of cardiovascular risk evaluation.14 While cardiologists\nand primary care physicians already review non-gated scans for the presence of CAC, an AI solution can be scaled\nover the entire national enterprise. This would enable the rapid identification of patients at the highest cardiovascular\nrisk and facilitate timely initiation of therapies to prevent irreversible events.\nWe introduce a deep learning segmentation model that achieves near expert-level accuracy in quantifying\ncoronary artery calcium from non-contrast, non-gated chest CT scans. The model generates segmentation masks that\nserve as a human-verifiable output, allowing physicians to rapidly confirm the presence of coronary calcification.\nGiven the distinctive high-attenuation appearance of coronary calcium on CT, it is easier and faster to verify than\nmany other imaging findings. Beyond identifying high-risk patients, AI-CAC can be used to filter slices within a\npatient's scan, presenting physicians only slices predicted to contain CAC to expedite the verification of patients\nwho screen positive.\nCompared to prior works, our approach is different in many respects. In addition to drawing data from a\nheterogenous national cohort, we did not filter out patients with pacemakers, mechanical valves, coronary stents, or\nprior cardiac surgeries as previous studies have done.21,22,23 Although these characteristics can be filtered out using\nelectronic medical record data, we believe it is more prudent to train a model which avoids pacemakers and\nprostheses as an added precaution in the event that patient chart data is inaccurate or missing.

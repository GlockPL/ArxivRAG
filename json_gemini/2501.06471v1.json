To address these challenges, this paper proposes three core technical solutions: LLM sharing protocol, LLM universal environment framework, and Agent optimal path module. To solve the computational resource constraints in the early stages of research, we further innovatively propose a joint mining mechanism, achieving bilateral value sharing between computing power providers and model designers, including breakthrough rewards for", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their powerful semantic understanding capabilities for text and multimodal information [1, 2, 5, 10, 26, 29, 39, 40]. LLMs have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities across various domains, and are becoming the foundational building blocks for the development of general-purpose AI agents or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [8, 19, 35, 37, 38].\nHowever, we have noticed that there are still some important issues that need to be addressed by the AI community.\n\u2022 Issue 1. Most LLMs tend to focus on specific domains, and there is no single model that consistently performs better than all others across various tasks [12]. Although many studies have explored the cooperation among LLMs [7, 21, 22, 25, 33, 34], these frameworks can only accommodate a limited number of LLMs, similar to the Local Area Network (LAN) in computer networking. Can we create an Internet of Large Language Models that allows for the free transfer of knowledge among any LLMs?\n\u2022 Issue 2. Given the large number of parameters and the substantial file sizes of LLMs [2], and the complexity on configuring development environments for LLMs, could we provide developers with a convenient model sharing and rapid environment configuration solution?\nIn the Al community, several initiatives such as Hugging Face [9], Ollama [20], AutoGen[36], and Langchain [16] have been undertaken to address the aforementioned challenges. Hugging Face serves as a significant model-sharing platform, hosting a vast array of open-source models and datasets for machine learning. Ollama facilitates the local configuration and running of large models through its excellent environment design. AutoGen, an open-source framework by Microsoft, assists developers in building, managing, and optimizing multi-agent systems. Langchain is a framework for developing applications driven by language models, providing capabilities for building workflows as well as supporting the combination of agents.\nDespite the powerful capabilities of these tools, mastering and configuring the entire toolkit requires not only extensive knowledge and a strong hardware setup, but also significant patience. The high requirements for expertise and the complexity of the operations hinder the further adoption of the aforementioned tools among the general public. According to Cognitive Load Theory [27, 28], users can only process a limited amount of information at one time. Therefore, when designing tools, it is essential to consider elements such as a simple user interface, automation of repetitive tasks, and clear, visual feedback. Based on this, two new issues are arised:\n\u2022 Issue 3. Can we develop a tool that can achieve one-click operations-including environment deployment, model downloads, development ebugging, and publishing sharing?\n\u2022 Issue 4. After optimizing based on the Baseline, could this tool automatically explore and combine LLMs to form the optimal Agent path?"}, {"title": "The Internet of Large Language Models", "content": "With these issues in mind, to understand the real needs from the perspective of front-line developers and researchers in identifying workable solutions, we engaged in comprehensive discussions with 63 experts working in fields such as Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, and Computer Graphics, including employees of leading companies in the industry and graduate students. Through the interactions, we identified another pressing issue:\n\u2022 Issue 5. The computational costs for training models are excessively high [6, 11, 24]. Can we significantly reduce the cost of training by designing a new distributed training framework?\nThese issues led us to realize that the AI-driven industrial revolution of this century still has a considerable distance to travel. From the development of tools and replication of baselines to the implementation of upper-layer applications, each step encounters significant obstacles, whether they be in technical requirements, time investment, or financial costs. These are challenges that the AI community must address and overcome collectively.\nConsidering the above issues, in this paper, we propose a new framework for LLM training and knowledge exchange, namely The Internet of LLM. Figure 1 shows the overview of the framework. We implemented four innovations in the Internet of LLM, with some based on secondary development of Langchain and Ollama:\n(1) LLM Sharing Protocol: Given the substantial need for LLMs in using, constructing Workflows, and developing Agents, the rapid transfer of LLMs across different regions presents a significant challenge. To address this, we devised a universal LLM model protocol to facilitate one-click integration and swift sharing.\n(2) LLM Universal Environment: Diverse environments pose numerous adaptation challenges for developers and users. To reduce entry barriers, we established a unified platform for development, training, and execution, thereby minimizing the time developers spend on environment setup, version control, and troubleshooting.\n(3) Agent Optimal Path: When handling complex tasks, the system continually selects and combines models, conducts joint training of multiple models, and evaluates and provides feedback on the results. Due to the time-intensive nature of this process, we employed parallel computing techniques to expedite the search for the optimal pathway that meets the current requirements.\n(4) Joint Mining: To alleviate the initial computational costs for researchers, computing power providers can contribute by offering computational resources. In return, they share two benefits with model designers: break- through rewards for optimal model pathways and long-term returns from the models. This arrangement enables researchers to access discounted or complimentary computational support.\nOur project will contribute to the AI community and the broader human society in the following aspects:\n\u2022 Facilitating Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration: The establishment of this framework provides an open and shared platform for researchers and developers worldwide, fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration across different regions and institutions. Such a collaborative model contributes to the aggregation of global intelligence and resources, jointly advancing the development of general artificial intelligence, and accelerating its application and popularization across various societal domains.\n\u2022 Lowering Technical Barriers and Promoting Widespread Adoption: By simplifying operational procedures and reducing computational costs, the framework enables more non-specialists to access and utilize general arti- ficial intelligence technologies, thereby expanding its audience. This facilitates an increase in societal awareness and acceptance of general artificial intelligence, creating favorable conditions for its broader dissemination and application at various social levels.\n\u2022 Promoting Industrial Ecosystem Development: The establishment and enhancement of this framework attract more enterprises, research institutions, and developers to participate in the general artificial intelligence"}, {"title": "2 Case Study of Related Work", "content": "2.1 Ollama\nOllama [20] is a platform specifically designed for local deployment, running, and managing large language models (like LLaMA).

Agents explore the sandbox environment, update their environment trees, and execute tasks. The sandbox environment provides concrete scenario support for agent behaviors, where task execution directly affects environmental states, demonstrating behavioral coherence and impact.\n6.4.6 Retrieval. The memory retrieval mechanism extracts the most relevant data for current tasks from the memory stream using strategies based on recency, importance, and relevance. Through semantic similarity calculations, agents can dynamically extract memories highly relevant to the current context, providing crucial support for planning, reaction, and decision-making. This mechanism ensures agents can quickly adapt to complex environments and make logical behavioral responses."}]}

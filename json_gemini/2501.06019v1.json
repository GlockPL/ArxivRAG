Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment, an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal EO data, particularly the combination of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a Building damage assessment dataset using veRy-hIGH-resolution optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse multimodal dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 12 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3 and 1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise damage assessment. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The corresponding experimental results can also serve as a baseline for future research, providing perspectives and inspiration for the design of custom models. The dataset, along with code and trained models, is available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT, and will be updated as new disaster data become available. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest Track II. We hope that the new dataset will further the use of AI-driven EO methods in support of people in disaster-affected areas.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "A disaster is defined as a serious disruption in the function-ing of a community or society due to the interaction between a hazard event and the conditions of exposure, vulnerability, and capacity; resulting in human, material, economic, or environmental losses and impacts (Ge et al., 2020). According to (UNDRR, 2018a), three types of natural disasters - earthquakes, storms, and floods - have caused \u22481.12 million deaths, affected 2.85 billion people, and resulted in more than 2,647 billion US dollars in economic losses between 1998 and 2017. The threat of disasters is likely to increase as a result of global urbanization. Rapid and comprehensive damage assessment is crucial in the aftermath of a disaster to make informed and effective rescue decisions and minimize losses and impacts. Among these assessments, building damage assessment, aiming at providing information including the area and amount of damage, the rate of collapsed buildings, and the type of damage incurred by each building, is particularly critical in the early stages. This is because the distribution of damaged buildings is closely related to life-saving efforts in emergency response (Xie et al., 2016; Adriano et al., 2021). However, conducting field surveys after a disaster is difficult and dangerous, especially when transportation and communication systems are disrupted, impeding efficient on-site assessments. Earth observation (EO) technology, also known as remote sensing, provides a safe and efficient way to obtain building damage information over disaster areas due to its wide field-of-view, low cost, and contactless operation.\nTwo primary types of EO technology, optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), are commonly used for assessing building damage after disasters. Optical EO imagery has been the primary source and has been extensively studied for building damage assessment, because of its intuitive and easy-to-interpret nature. Initially, moderate-resolution optical EO data, exemplified by the Landsat series and Sentinel-2, was used for assessing building damage (Yusuf et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2019; Sandhini Putri et al., 2022). However, these were limited by spatial resolution and only provided broad approximations of affected areas, lacking accuracy for specific buildings, which is crucial for timely rescue. The new generation of very-high-resolution (VHR) optical sensors, such as IKONOS and WorldView, provide EO data with spatial resolutions at the meter and even sub-meter level, enabling finer assessments at the level of individual buildings (Freire et al., 2014). These data have been successfully used for building damage assessment after multiple natural disasters (Yamazaki and Matsuoka, 2007; Tong et al., 2012; Freire et al., 2014). While accurate building damage proxy maps can be obtained through visual interpretation by experts, this process is time-consuming, requires trained professionals, and is in practice too labor-intensive for rapid, large-scale assessments. Therefore, much of the recent literature has focused on developing automated methods for rapid building damage proxy mapping (Tong et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2021). Among these, artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning (DL) techniques, have proved particularly effective, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of building damage assessments. Early works were often specific to a single disaster event, with labels annotated for a particular disaster area to train the model, which was then used to generate building damage proxy maps for the same event (Xie et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2023). Since the associated training sets are limited to a narrow range of building types, damage patterns, and background land-cover distributions, the resulting models lack generalizability and struggle to produce accurate building damage proxy maps for new disaster events, which limits their practical use. The release of large-scale benchmark datasets including a variety of disaster scenarios and damage types, such as the xBD dataset (Gupta et al., 2019), opens up the possibility of using DL models to quickly and accurately map building damages after a newly occurred, previously unseen disaster. A number of state-of-the-art methods based on various DL models have been designed (Zheng et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2022; Kaur et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2024). For example, Zheng et al. (2021) trained DL models on the xBD dataset and applied them to mapping building damages on two unseen man-made disaster events. These studies showcase the power of employing DL models for building damage mapping. However, optical EO, being a passive sensing technique, needs suitable solar illumination and cloud-free weather conditions, which severely limits its application as an emergency tool for all-weather disaster response (Adriano et al., 2021). Actual disaster events, especially wildfires, floods, and storms, are often accompanied by less-than-ideal imaging conditions. For instance, Figure 1 shows EO data captured for a wildfire event that occurred in August 2023 in Hawaii, USA. The post-event optical image shown in Figure 1b does not provide clear surface information due to the effects of smoke from the wildfire. In contrast, SAR sensors employ active illumination with longer microwaves and can acquire images in adverse weather conditions, offering great potential for all-weather disaster response. As illustrated in Figure 1c, SAR imagery is unaffected by smoke and clearly shows buildings damaged by the wildfire.\nDue to the above advantages of SAR data and the development of associated processing technology, various SAR-based methods have been proposed for assessing building damage. These methods utilize intensity (Matsuoka and Yamazaki, 2005, 2010; Matsuoka et al., 2010), coherence (Yonezawa and Takeuchi, 2001; Arciniegas et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2016; Liu and Yamazaki, 2017), or polarization features (Yamaguchi, 2012; Chen and Sato, 2013; Watanabe et al., 2016; Karimzadeh and Mastuoka, 2017) for the building damage assessment at the block unit level, depending on the acquisition mode. Several studies have attempted to extend the block-level approach or have explored"}, {"title": "1.1 Comparison with existing datasets", "content": "The comparison between BRIGHT and existing datasets for building damage assessment is summarized in Table 1. Most current building damage assessment datasets are limited in scale and scope due to the scarcity of disaster events, the limited availability of corresponding open-source EO data and the annotation effort (Rahnemoonfar et al., 2021; Gupta and Shah, 2021; Kaur et al., 2023). Due to the high cost and time required for pixel-level labeling, some datasets, such as those provided by (Fujita et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2024), offer image-level labeling, indicating only whether an image contains damaged buildings. Although useful, this information lacks the spatial precision needed to guide specific rescue operations. The XBD dataset (Gupta et al., 2019) is currently the largest open data collection, covering six natural disasters in 15 regions with more than 700,000 building instances. However, xBD includes only optical EO data and therefore does not support all-weather disaster response. Sun et al. (2024) have created a multimodal dataset, but it is limited to a single disaster event and contains only about 4,000 building instances. The small size makes it challenging to train DL models, and significantly limits the transferability of the trained models. The dataset most similar to our work is BDD, proposed by Adriano et al. (2021). The main differences between BDD and BRIGHT are: First, BRIGHT covers more disaster events and building instances, including both natural and human-made disasters. Second, BRIGHT has higher spatial resolution; while the highest resolution of SAR images in BDD is 1 meter, BRIGHT provides finer detail with spatial resolution from 0.3 meter to 1 meter, allowing for the detection of subtle structural damage in individual buildings. Third, and perhaps most important, the re-distribution of BDD is restricted, whereas BRIGHT is an open-source dataset publicly available to the global community. Beyond the ones listed in Table 1, there are further datasets targeted at monitoring hazardous events related to disasters, but not concerned with building damage assessment, including landslides (Ghorbanzadeh et al., 2022; Meena et al., 2023), floods (Bonafilia et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2023) and wildfires (Art\u00e9s et al., 2019; Huot et al., 2022; He et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "1.2 Main contribution", "content": "The contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) We present BRIGHT, the first multimodal building damage dataset with a spatial resolution greater than 1 meter, and make it publicly available to the community. BRIGHT employs a combination of pre-event optical imagery and post-event SAR imagery with abundant disaster events and rich geographic diversity, thereby supporting the study of AI-based multimodal building damage mapping, especially in developing countries; 2) We evaluate a series of contemporary DL baselines on BRIGHT. The results of these experiments, along with the source code and model weights, are also made publicly available in support of future research and a benchmark for the current potential of EO-based disaster response. The trained models may serve as a basis for methodological advances or to build damage assessment pipelines for real-world applications."}, {"title": "2 Study areas and disaster events", "content": "We selected 12 disaster events across the globe for our BRIGHT dataset, as illustrated in Figure 2.

Both Capella and Umbra data have two imaging modalities, i.e., Spotlight and Stripmap, respectively. The Spotlight mode has a higher spatial resolution but less coverage. In the region of interest, we preferred Spotlight mode if there is suitable data in the data provider's inventory, otherwise, we chose Stripmap. The optical EO data consist of red, blue, and green bands, while the SAR EO data are mainly amplitude data in the VV or HH bands. For optical EO data, the digital number was converted to reflectance and then standardized to an 8-bit data format. For SAR imagery, after the data have been terrain-corrected, we used the data provider's recommended method of pre-processing the amplitude data and finally converted the same to an 8-bit data format. Although both optical and SAR images are geocoded, there is still some pixel offset between them. Therefore, multiple experts manually aligned the paired optical and SAR data and cross-checked each other to ensure the precise registration between the two types of EO data.\nThe labels in BRIGHT consist of two components: building polygons and post-disaster building damage attributes. Expert annotators manually labeled the building polygons, and all labels underwent independent visual inspections to ensure accuracy. Damage annotations were obtained from Copernicus Emergency Management Service\u00b2 and the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT)3 Emergency Mapping Products. These annotations were derived through visual interpretation of high-resolution optical imagery captured before and after the disasters by EO experts, supplemented by partial field visits. Since the number of damage levels varied across different events, we adopted the approach in (Adriano et al., 2021) to standardize them into three categories: intact, damaged, and destroyed. The damage annotations were provided as vector point files. By overlaying these points with the building polygons and assigning corresponding damage attributes, we generated the final building"}, {"title": "3.2 Statistics for BRIGHT", "content": "The basic information about BRIGHT, including disaster events, EO data, the number of corresponding EO tiles, and the total number of building pixels, is summarized in Table 2. After cropping the EO data into 1024\u00d71024-pixel tiles, BRIGHT contains 4,538 multimodal image pairs (excluding events related to IEEE GRSS DFC 2025). As BRIGHT covers different disaster events located in different regions across the globe, this ensures the geographical diversity of its sample.\nKey statistics of BRIGHT are illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the pixel value distribution for optical and SAR images from one man-made disaster and three natural disasters. The varying geographical landscapes and land cover across different regions result in distinct means and standard deviations of pixel values, highlighting BRIGHT's geographical diversity and making it a robust dataset for studying building damage assessment in diverse environments. To ensure trained deep learning (DL) models can accurately detect buildings and assess damage levels, it is crucial that the dataset includes a wide variety of building styles from different regions. Figure 4b shows that BRIGHT covers buildings at multiple scales, exhibiting a \"long-tail\" distribution. This multi-scale representation challenges DL models to develop the ability to capture features at varying scales, enhancing robustness and accuracy.\nFigure 4c further illustrates the feature distribution of buildings in optical and SAR images for the same four events shown in Figure 4a, demonstrating clear inter-event separability in both modalities. Finally, BRIGHT faces a significant challenge of sample imbalance. There is a notable imbalance between background pixels and foreground (building) pixels, with a ratio of approximately 7:1. Additionally, an imbalance exists within damage categories: only about 6.5% of building pixels represent destroyed buildings, 6.7% correspond to damaged buildings, and 86.8% are intact buildings. This imbalance complicates model training, necessitating careful strategies to develop robust DL models.\nWe also evaluated the alignment errors between optical and SAR EO data in BRIGHT. Table 3 presents the mean co-registration errors, measured in root mean square error (RMSE) of pixel displacement, obtained using three different multimodal image registration methods: RIFT (Li et al., 2020), SRIF (Li et al., 2023a), and LNIFT (Li et al., 2022). The evaluation resulted in an RMSE of about 1.5 pixels between optical and SAR EO data.

Gerard et al. (2024) suggested that dividing the dataset on an event-by-event basis, rather than randomly across the entire dataset, provides a more accurate reflection of a model's generalizability. Therefore, for the first 12 events listed in Table 2, we divide the corresponding data for each event into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of 7:1:2. The sets obtained for each event are then merged to create the final training, validation, and test sets.

The generalization capability of the models is subsequently evaluated on the test set."}, {"title": "4 Methodology", "content": "The objective of building damage assessment is to interpret EO data covering the affected area and generate a building damage proxy map that reflects the extent of damage to buildings. To achieve this, two common solutions are typically employed.\nOne is to directly treat the building damage assessment task as a single semantic segmentation task (Adriano et al., 2021; Gupta and Shah, 2021). The pre- and post-event images are taken as inputs of the model, and then the final damage proxy map is directly predicted, which can be formalized as $Y_{dam} = M_{seg} (X_{T1}, X_{T2})$, where is $X_{T1}$ is the pre-event imagery, $X_{T2}$ is the post-event imagery, $M_{seg} (\\cdot)$ is a semantic segmentation model, $Y_{dam}$ is the obtained damage proxy map. In the context of this paper, $X_{T1}$ is VHR optical imagery and $X_{T2}$ is VHR SAR imagery.\nThe second solution adopts the task decoupling approach (Gupta et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2021), which breaks down building damage assessment into two subtasks: the building localization task, i.e., separating the building from the"}, {"title": "4.2 Deep learning architecture", "content": "We evaluate BRIGHT using several advanced deep network architectures from both the computer vision and remote sensing communities.

Traditionally, building damage proxy maps are generated through expert visual interpretation, a time-consuming process. Although ML- and DL-based methods offer automated and efficient approaches to building damage proxy mapping, they are often limited by the available training data. Large open-source optical datasets, though valuable, restrict models to optical imagery alone. The acquisition of clean optical EO data also requires sunlight and a cloud-free environment, which can result in delays of several days for certain disaster events such as typhoons and wildfires. As the first globally distributed multimodal dataset, BRIGHT encompasses both pre-event optical imagery and post-event SAR imagery. This unique combination overcomes the limitations of optical EO data by enabling models trained on BRIGHT to monitor disaster-stricken areas regardless of weather conditions or daylight.

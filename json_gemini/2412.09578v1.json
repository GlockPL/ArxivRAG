{"title": "DISHONEST: Dissecting misInformation Spread using Homogeneous\nsOcial Networks and Semantic Topic classification", "authors": ["Caleb Stam", "Emily Saldanha", "Mahantesh Halappanavar", "Anurag Acharya"], "abstract": "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic\nresulted in a significant rise in the spread of\nmisinformation on online platforms such as\nTwitter. Oftentimes this growth is blamed on\nthe idea of the \"echo chamber.\" However, the\nbehavior said to characterize these echo cham-\nbers exists in two dimensions. The first is in a\nuser's social interactions, where they are said\nto stick with the same clique of like-minded\nusers. The second is in the content of their\nposts, where they are said to repeatedly espouse\nhomogeneous ideas. In this study, we link the\ntwo by using Twitter's network of retweets to\nstudy social interactions and topic modeling\nto study tweet content. In order to measure\nthe diversity of a user's interactions over time,\nwe develop a novel metric to track the speed\nat which they travel through the social net-\nwork. The application of these analysis meth-\nods to misinformation-focused data from the\npandemic demonstrates correlation between so-\ncial behavior and tweet content. We believe\nthis correlation supports the common intuition\nabout how antisocial users behave, and further\nsuggests that it holds even in subcommunities\nalready rife with misinformation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was accom-\npanied by an infodemic of online misinformation\n(Kouzy et al., 2020; Cinelli et al., 2020). In fol-\nlowing years, social media platforms have tried\nmany mitigation strategies to combat anti-vaccine\nrhetoric and restore trust in scientific expertise\n(Sundelson et al., 2023; Calleja et al., 2021). How-\never, these strategies were not fully effective. Even\nin what can now be considered a \"post-pandemic\"\nera, extremist communities of misinformation and\ndistrust continue to grow rather than wane (Innes,\n2023)."}, {"title": "1.1 Background", "content": "Over the course of the pandemic, we've noted the\nclear threat misinformation has posed to public\nhealth. On social media platforms like Twitter\nand Facebook, misinformation has been shown\nto spread faster than the truth (Johnson et al.,\n2020). Once misinformation has spread online,\nit seeps into real life. Exposure to online misin-\nformation has been shown to negatively affect in-\ndividuals intent to vaccinate (Jolley and Douglas,\n2020; Katherine Kricorian and Equils, 2022). More\ngenerally, online misinformation threatens public\nhealth through encouraging real-life violence and\nharassment (Shapiro, 2019; Zadrozny and Edwards,\n2019).\nDiscussion about this spread is largely centered\naround the echo chamber, a homogeneous commu-\nnity said to form both on social media platforms\nand in real life. Such chambers are explained via\nmechanisms which reinforce one's existing opin-\nions, encouraging them to grow more extreme (Sun-\nstein, 1999). Studies that model disinformation ac-\ncordingly have seen success. In particular, the struc-\nture of communities on Twitter and Facebook tend\nto resemble echo chambers.(Cinelli et al., 2021).\nHowever, the study of the echo chamber has also\nbeen criticised. While some accept the echo cham-\nber phenomenon as fact, others criticise it for a lack\nof empirical evidence or precise definitions. (Bruns,\n2021). For instance, there is a lack of consensus on\nwhat signals make up the echo. While the conven-\ntional idea of an echo chamber suggests individu-\nals are exposed to opinions matching their own,\nmore recent studies have shown an unexpected\nfrequency of cross-cutting exchanges and debates\n(Iyengar and Hahn, 2009; Garrett, 2009). Rather\nthan contradicting the echo chamber phenomenon,\nthis frequency is used to describe a different type\nof chamber, where constant cross-partisan interac-\ntion serves polarizes users further instead of than\nmediating between them (Bright et al., 2020)."}, {"title": "1.2 Preliminaries", "content": "Our work approaches the study of antivaccine mis-\ninformation on social media from a new angle. We\nbelieve that emphasis on the echo chamber as a\nglobal structure has obscured the importance of\nuser-level analysis. Instead of modeling a global\ncommunity structure, we will examine online ac-\ntors at the individual level. More specifically, we\ncompare two dimensions of a user's online behav-\nior: the speed of their social interactions, and the\ndiversity of the content they post.\nFirst, we are concerned with each user's eager-\nness or unwillingness to interact with those distant\nfrom them in the social network. While the study\nof spatio-temporal patterns for individual network\nactors has seen some coverage in the literature (Wei\nand Carley, 2015), a metric for this quantity has\nnot been definitively established. Therefore, we\npropose our own, which we refer to as node speed.\nSecond, we will analyze the extent to which the\ncontent a user posts aligns with misinformation nar-\nratives. We leverage natural language processing\nto achieve this goal. First, we use topic modeling\nto label posts by their semantic meaning. These\ntopics allow for the computation of several user-\nlevel statistics, each of which are compared to node\nspeed in order to draw connections between social\nand semantic diversity."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The task of analyzing misinformation on Twitter\ncan be approached through the lens of several dis-\nciplines. Due to the multimodality of social media\ndata, many computational methods see strong re-\nsults and provide alternative views of the patterns\nof information spread and user interactions. In our\nstudy, we leverage a combination of semantic topic\nmodeling, dynamic social network analysis, and\nstatistical inference. Further, the problem of misin-\nformation is inherently social. Therefore, methods\nfrom the social sciences such as qualitative content\nanalysis see significant use. Existing work in each\nof these fields has brought advancements in the\nstudy of misinformation that lay the foundation for\nour work."}, {"title": "2.1 Topic Modeling", "content": "Various topic modeling frameworks, including\nLatent Dirchlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003),\nBERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), and Top2Vec (An-\ngelov, 2020) have been leveraged to analyze so-"}, {"title": "2.2 Social Network Analysis", "content": "Other analyses of COVID-19 related misinforma-\ntion place emphasis on the social network. Ap-\nproaches inspired by echo chambers have used\nvarious community detection algorithms to find\nclusters of users in networks rife with misinfor-\nmation, although the structure and nature of these\ngroups varies vastly by domain (Ahmed and Sadri,\n2022; Recuero et al., 2021). Analysis of centrality\nmetrics in these groups have found relationships\nbetween various network properties and the likeli-\nhood to spread misinformation. Next, the study of\ninformation cascades, which can be seen as paths\nin social networks, has also seen significant work.\nRumors and misinformation, both generally and in\nthe context of COVID-19, have been shown to have\nrelatively strong cascades, which could imply more\n\"sprawl\" in online communities (Vosoughi et al.,\n2018; Solovev and Pr\u00f6llochs, 2022). Specific re-\nsearch on the structure of information cascades on\npandemic-related Twitter networks show that cas-\ncades of retweets are large in length but decay faster\ntemporally than other options like quote retweets\nand replies (Dinh and Parulian, 2020). Graph neu-\nral networks have also been leveraged on social net-\nworks to detect misinformation spreaders (Hamid\net al., 2020; Maulana and Langguth, 2023)."}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": "In this section, we describe our data sources, data\nprocessing pipeline, and present an exploratory\ndata analysis along with the analytical pipelines\nfor topic modeling and social network analysis.\nA framework for our methodology is shown in"}, {"title": "3.1 Data", "content": "In this study, we leveraged the Avax dataset (Muric\net al., 2021), which contains 1,235,833 tweets re-\nlated to vaccine hesitancy from October 2020 to\nMay 2021. This time period is of particular im-\nportance to public health, as it contains discussion\nleading up to and following the widespread distri-\nbution of COVID-19 vaccines.\nThis dataset was collected using a set of anti-\nvaccine keywords generated with a snowballing\napproach. Here, a small list of manually curated\nantivaccine-related keywords were iteratively ex-\npanded by identifying additional co-occuring key-\nwords. This methodology resulted in a set of\napproximately 60 words and phrases that were\nqueried into the Twitter streaming API to collect\ntweets. The nature of this data collection pro-\ncess leaves us with tweets mainly focused on anti-\nvaccine rhetoric and conspiracy theories.\nIn Figure 2, we show that the temporal distribu-\ntion of tweets in the dataset grows over time with a\npeak in April of 2021.

This leaves us with four interactions\nwe could choose to use as edges: retweets, quote\nretweets, replies, and mentions. In this study, we\nchoose to use retweets. We do so in order to assure\nthat edges in our social network connect users of\nsimilar sentiment. While the other three possible\ntypes of edges (quote retweets, replies, and men-\ntions) are all accompanied by text, retweets are the\nonly edge lacking a text component. From quali-\ntative sampling of the three text-based edges, we\nnotice that a large proportion of these edges repre-\nsent disagreement between Twitter users. On the\nother hand, we can typically assume that a retweet\nof another tweet, without accompanied text, im-\nplies agreed sentiment between the user making\nthe retweet and the creator of the original tweet.\nBecause, in this study, we are interested in the nar-\nratives that users identify with, not just the ones we\ninteract with, we filter our edges to only retweets.\nLastly, because retweets are the most common type\nof tweet in the dataset, we do not believe that omit-\nting the other three options leads to significant loss\nof data.\nWe use the following methodology to construct\nthe social network graph. First, we collect all\nretweets from the Avax dataset. If a retweet ex-\nists, in either direction, between any two users, we\nadd an edge between the two users. The represen-\ntation of the graph in python is created using the\nNetworkX library (Hagberg and Conway, 2020).\nThis results in an unweighted, undirected social net-\nwork. We choose not to weight our graph in order\nto support the computation of the metric described\nin the next section.\nSince we are concerned with how users move\nthrough the social network over time, we take mul-\ntiple temporal snapshots of this social network. We\ndivide the full span into bins of two weeks each and\ngenerate the cumulative set of retweet interactions\nuntil the start of each bin.

Thus, we expect to see\na larger population of nodes that are slower than\nthe average user in Avax than the population that\nare faster than the average user. There was no\napparent correlation between a user's total number\nof retweets and their speed.\nPast studies indicate that the tendency Twitter\nusers involved in COVID-19 discourse to mingle is\nskewed toward asociality (Sacco et al., 2021). Our\nqualitative analysis seems to support this outlook.\nOutliers with low speed are truly extreme cases.\nFor example, for one user with speed 1.25, 123\nout of 129 of their recorded tweets were retweets\nfrom a single user. Taking a closer look, the user\nwas retweeting an account that regularly posted\nvaccination statistics for the UK. While this is an\ninteresting result to see in our dataset, it doesn't\nnecessarily align with our intuition. Rather, we\nobserve that users with strange social behavior also\nhave strange behavior with respect to content.\nOnce we cross the threshold of about 1.5, the\nusers interactions are more typical. A particular\nuser with a speed of around 1.65, for instance, ap-\npears to be our prototypical low-social-diversity\nuser. While they interact with a more varied set of\nusers than the previous user, their interactions are\nstill relatively concentrated to just a few accounts.\nLastly, we see that our fastest users have a more\ndiverse spread of interactions. For instance, con-\nsider a user with speed 2.22. If we consider the top\nthree accounts that this user retweeted, we notice\nthey make up 30% of the user's total retweets. Cal-\nculating the same metric for the user with speed\n1.65 shows that 50% of their tweets are concen-\ntrated in three accounts. This is expected, as a\nwider variety of retweeted should generally lead\nto the inclusion of longer paths in the node speed\ncomputation. Next, we move towards comparing\nnetwork speed with semantic topic labels."}, {"title": "4.2 Speed and Change in Topic", "content": "One way to link node speed to our topic labels is by\nmeasuring the change in a user's choice of topics\nover time.

The distribution of the mono-\ntonicity statistic is shown in Figure 4b. Here, we\nsee a distribution that is strongly skewed to the\nright. As seen in 4c, this skew and the high noise\nmakes it difficult to establish a definite linear cor-\nrelation. However, we do notice a relationship\nbetween the extreme values in each statistic.\nIt appears that users that lie on the right tail of the"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The patterns we see in our results support the idea\nthat sections of Twitter with widespread with mis-\ninformation are generally antisocial. Despite this,\nwe see that even in these sections users with more\ndiverse social interactions tweet about more diverse\ntopics. This suggests that topics may travel in\ngroups, rather than individually. This fact com-\nplicates the challenge of suppressing misinforma-\ntion. Many existing approaches to the mitigation\nof misinformation tackle the problem at an indi-\nvidual level, focusing on one topic at a time (Ha-\nlappanavar, 2021). Our results motivate a more\nholistic approach.\nAnother interesting result was the overlap of\nextreme users in speed and monotonicity. Our find-\nings seem to suggest that a complete focus on a\nsingle topic implies a lack of participation in the\nwider social community at all. From our qualita-\ntive analysis, we believe these users are best seen\nas outliers. While they may not fit into our broader\nframework, they demonstrate the ability to com-\npletely isolate even on social platforms.\nOur methodology in this study is also widely\ngeneralizable to other applications in the compu-\ntational social sciences. For any dynamic network\nincorporating text data, an analysis following this\nframework can help to identify overarching pat-\nterns in the social and semantic diversity of network\nagents. Even without text data, our node speed met-\nric could be applied in a variety of dynamic social\nnetworks beyond social media platforms.\nFurthermore, we believe that our work could see\nmeaningful application in misinformation-aware\nrecommender systems. A primary principle of rec-\nommender systems is that of homophily, where\nlike-minded users tend to be interested in the same\ncontent. However, this can lead to the creation of\na filter bubble effect, a cousin of the echo cham-\nber that lowers the diversity of the content users"}, {"title": "6 Limitations & Future Work", "content": "We believe the primary limitation of our work is\ndataset incompleteness. Amendments to the aca-\ndemic access policy for Twitter's API in 2023 in-\ncluded barriers that prevented us from being able to\nextract a high volume of tweets. Consequently, we\nwere unable to access each user's historical record\nof tweets, and instead could only consider those\nthat are included the Avax streaming dataset. While\na complete dataset would improve confidence in\nour results, we believe that the subset of tweets in\nAvax is a sufficient sample for our purposes.\nThe second limitation of our work is the confi-\ndence in the node speed metric. We developed this\nmetric to get a per-user measure of \"speed\" in a\nsocial network. We believe that for this particular\nuse case, the metric was sufficiently validated by\nthe results of its application to the Avax data, the\nsimplicity of its calculation, and its similarity to\nexisting metrics (Wei and Carley, 2015). However,\nwe believe a deeper investigation into the properties\nof node speed, such as its variance or sensitivity to\nnoise, is necessary for more granular data.\nLastly, we believe that further work focused on\nincorporating the notion of influence could yield\npowerful results. We have seen that users tweet-\ning about a variety of topics tend to migrate faster\nthroughout the social network. If this speed also\nrepresents influence, then this would suggest that\nmisinformation narratives spread as a group rather\nthan independently."}]}

AI can handle routine and repetitive tasks", "Approach": "Use Al to complement human testing efforts by\n      automating repetitive tests and analyzing large datasets", "Loop": "Establish a feedback loop where human testers\n      review and refine AI-generated test cases", "Review": "Regularly review and update AI models and test automation\n      frameworks to ensure they align with changing application features and business\n      needs. Human oversight is essential to maintain relevance and accuracy.\n    \u039f Hybrid Testing Strategies: Implement hybrid testing strategies where AI and\n      human testers collaborate. For instance", "Adaptation": "Train AI models using diverse and representative data\n      to improve their accuracy and reduce biases. Human testers should also stay\n      updated on advancements in Al tools and methodologies to leverage them\n      effectively.\n\nBy balancing the strengths of AI and human expertise, organizations can optimize their testing\nprocesses, achieve higher efficiency, and ensure comprehensive coverage. The combination of\nautomation and human oversight enhances the overall quality and effectiveness of software testing"}]}

However, a critical component for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) lies in the accurate prediction of the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Trajectory prediction plays an essential role in the decision-making processes of autonomous systems, providing invaluable insights for trajectory planning modules. This enables AVs to anticipate the movements of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, thus ensuring safer and more efficient navigation in highly dynamic traffic environments [1].\nDespite the considerable advancements in trajectory prediction models, notable gaps remain in addressing the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty within complex traffic scenarios. Traffic environments often involve diverse agent types, ranging from motor vehicles and motorcycles to pedestrians and cyclists, each exhibiting distinct behaviors and motion patterns. Furthermore, the uncertainty in these scenarios stems from a myriad of factors, including unpredictable human behavior, varying environmental conditions, and the continuous flow of mixed traffic. These challenges make the accurate prediction of future trajectories a formidable task [9]. Current trajectory prediction models have primarily focused on the uncertainties associated with the target agent, often neglecting the comprehensive uncertainties that pervade the overall traffic environment. This limitation restricts the model's ability to fully capture the complexities and unpredictability of real-world traffic scenarios.\nThe first significant limitation in existing trajectory prediction models is the inadequate simulation of future traffic scenarios, a fundamental aspect for improving prediction accuracy. The dynamic nature of traffic, characterized by unpredictable interactions and evolving environmental conditions, renders the accurate forecasting of future traffic a complex challenge. Most existing models predominantly focus on predicting the behavior of a single target agent, without sufficiently considering the broader uncertainties stemming from the interactions between multiple agents and their environment. Consequently, these models fall short in comprehensively simulating future traffic scenarios, which undermines their ability to deliver precise trajectory predictions [37; ?]. Therefore, there is a pressing need for trajectory prediction frameworks that can proficiently account for uncertainties across the entire traffic scene, encompassing both agent-to-agent interactions and environmental context.\nA second critical challenge concerns the modeling of interactions between traffic agents. Human drivers' decision-making processes are shaped by interactions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and infrastructure, occurring within both spatial and temporal dimensions. While recent models have made significant progress in capturing spatial interactions, such as the relative positioning and distances between agents, they frequently overlook the crucial temporal dynamics that influence how these interactions evolve over time [37]. Temporal interactions, including variations in speed, acceleration, and intent, are pivotal for predicting future movements in complex and dynamic environments. Hence, it is essential for trajectory prediction models to incorporate both spatial and temporal dimensions to comprehensively model traffic behavior.\nTo address these critical gaps, we introduce a novel generative model, CDSTraj, which incorporates a Characterized Diffusion Module and a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Mod-"}, {"title": "RELATED WORKS", "content": "Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving. Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving. Early trajectory prediction methods primarily relied on manual feature engineering and rule-based techniques, such as linear regression and Kalman filters, which were limited in capturing the complex interactions present in dynamic environments [12]. These methods provided a basic framework but were insufficient for modeling the intricate relationships between traffic agents. The field evolved significantly with the advent of deep learning, particularly with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [13] and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [14; 15; 7]. These advancements enabled the modeling of temporal dependencies within trajectory data, making it possible to capture the sequential nature of agent movements. Further innovation in this area was driven by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [16; 10; 2], which offered a more sophisticated approach to modeling the interactions among multiple agents in congested and heterogeneous traffic scenes. However, while these models improved spatial interaction modeling, temporal dynamics remain underexplored.\nAdditionally, domain adaptation techniques have been introduced to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models when exposed to new or varying traffic scenarios. Xi et al. (2024) proposed a novel approach that integrates semantic analysis and domain adaptation to improve the interpretation of roadway features in autonomous driving, thereby enhancing the ability of models to adapt to diverse and challenging environments [?].\nGenerative Models for Trajectory Prediction.Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [27] and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) [18], have gained considerable attention in the trajectory prediction domain. GANs utilize a generator-discriminator architecture, where the generator creates synthetic trajectories, and the discriminator attempts to distinguish them from real trajectories. This adversarial process allows GAN-based models to produce realistic trajectory predictions but can be challenging to optimize due to issues like mode collapse. In contrast, VAES focus on generating probabilistic distributions of potential trajectories, though they often require complex optimization procedures for balancing the reconstruction and latent space exploration. These approaches enable the generation of diverse trajectories but still struggle to capture the complete uncertainty in dynamic environments.\nDiffusion models have recently emerged as a simpler yet powerful alternative in generative modeling. Unlike GANS and VAEs, diffusion models focus on modeling the forward and reverse diffusion processes, which can simplify the training procedure and offer greater stability. Our work leverages diffusion models to capture confidence features during trajectory prediction, a novel application that allows for more accurate modeling of uncertainty and dynamic agent interactions.\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), commonly referred to as diffusion models, have gained recognition as highly effective generative models across various fields, including image generation [19; 20; 8], video generation [22], and 3D shape generation [24]. These models operate by iteratively adding and removing noise to generate data that matches the distribution of the target domain. Inspired by their success in other generative tasks, our work introduces diffusion models to the field of trajectory prediction for autonomous driving. This novel application addresses the challenges associated with modeling the uncertainty and complex interactions between agents in dynamic traffic environments. By integrating diffusion models, we can iteratively refine trajectory predictions, improving the overall robustness and reliability of the model."}, {"title": "Problem Formulation", "content": "The primary goal of this study is to accurately predict the future trajectories of all entities within the vicinity of an autonomous vehicle (AV) in a mixed-autonomy environment. Each entity surrounding the AV is referred to as a target agent. At a given time $t_c$, our model aims to leverage the historical motion states of both the target agent and its neighboring agents to predict the future trajectory of the target agent, denoted as $Y_0$, over a future time horizon extending from $t_c$ to $t_c+t_f$. The historical motion data from time $t_c - t_h$ is represented by $X_0$ for the target agent and $X_i$ for the neighboring agents.\nThe key innovation of our model lies in its utilization of anticipated future behaviors of neighboring agents to refine"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In this section, we elaborate on the core components of our proposed framework for trajectory prediction, which is built upon the foundation of an enhanced diffusion process, augmented by a sophisticated spatial-temporal encoding strategy. The aim is to effectively model the inherent uncertainties and intricate dynamics present in multi-agent autonomous driving scenarios. Our methodology comprises three primary stages: the enhanced diffusion model for uncertainty reduction, a spatial-temporal encoding mechanism for feature extraction, and a decoding phase for trajectory generation."}, {"title": "Enhanced Diffusion Model", "content": "The enhanced diffusion model forms the cornerstone of our approach, providing a robust framework for simulating the uncertainty associated with predicting future trajectories. The diffusion process is structured to incrementally add noise in a forward process and then refine this noisy estimate through an iterative reverse process, thereby progressively reducing uncertainty and improving the fidelity of the predicted paths.\nForward Diffusion\nIn the forward diffusion phase, we aim to introduce a controlled level of uncertainty into the original trajectory data to simulate the potential variability in future paths. Given an initial trajectory representation $C$, the diffusion process starts by adding Gaussian noise at each step:\n$C^0 = C$ (2)\n$C^\u03b4 = f_{diff}(C^{\u03b4-1}), \u03b4 = 1, 2, ..., \u0393$ (3)\nwhere $\u0393$ represents the total number of diffusion steps, and $f_{diff}$ is the noise-adding function that ensures the variance of the diffusion process grows in a controlled manner across different steps. This stepwise noise addition allows the model to simulate various possible future outcomes, which are essential for capturing the range of uncertainties in dynamic environments.\nReverse Diffusion\nThe reverse diffusion process is designed to iteratively denoise the initial noisy trajectory estimates, effectively refining the predictions through a series of learned transformations. This process leverages the context provided by historical trajectory data to guide the denoising. The initialization of the reverse diffusion involves generating K independent samples from a normal distribution to serve as the initial noisy estimates:\n$\\hat{C} \\sim N(0, I), k = 1, 2, ..., K$ (4)\nThe iterative denoising then proceeds by refining each estimate through a denoising function $f_{denoise}$, which is conditioned on the historical context:\n$\\hat{C}^\u03b4 = f_{denoise}(\\hat{C}^{\u03b4+1}, X_0, X_i), \u03b4 = \u0393 - 1,...,0$ (5)\nHere, $f_{denoise}$ is a parameterized function that iteratively reduces the uncertainty by leveraging the historical states $X_0$ and intermediate states $X_i$, thereby guiding the refinement of the predicted trajectories.\nAdaptive Parameter Estimation\nTo enhance the efficacy of the reverse diffusion, we introduce an adaptive step-size mechanism in the form of step-specific parameters $\u03b1_\u03b4$ and $\\bar{\u03b1}_\u03b4$, which adjust the scale of updates at each diffusion step. The parameterized update rule for the denoising process is given by:\n$\u03b5 = f_\u03b5(\\hat{C}^{\u03b4+1}, X_0, C_{encoder}, \u03b4)$ (6)\n$\\hat{C}^\u03b4 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\u03b1_\u03b4}}( \\frac{\\hat{C}^{\u03b4+1} - \\sqrt{1 - \u03b1_\u03b4} \u03b5}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\u03b1}_\u03b4}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \u03b1_\u03b4}{\u03b1_\u03b4}} z )$ (7)\nwhere $z \\sim N(0, I)$ represents the Gaussian noise introduced to maintain diversity during the refinement process, thus ensuring that the predicted trajectory covers a wide range of plausible future scenarios."}, {"title": "Spatial-Temporal Encoding", "content": "In order to accurately model the complex interactions among multiple agents in dynamic environments, it is crucial to capture both spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. To this end, we employ a hybrid spatial-temporal encoding strategy that effectively integrates information across different agents and time steps.\nTemporal Encoding\nThe temporal encoding mechanism is designed to capture the sequential dependencies inherent in the agents' historical trajectories. At each time step t, we update the feature representation using a temporal embedding layer followed by a recurrent update mechanism:\n$F_t = \u03c6(W_{emb}x_t)$ (8)\n$h_t = f_{tem}(F_t, h_{t-1}, W_{init})$ (9)\nwhere $W_{emb}$ is the learnable embedding matrix that transforms the raw input $x_t$, and $\u03c6$ represents a non-linear activation function (e.g., LeakyReLU) to introduce non-linearity.

The attention weights are then computed to determine the relevance of each agent's interaction:\n$\u03b1 = softmax(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d}})$ (11)\nThe resulting weighted sum of the value vectors provides a context-aware spatial representation:\n$Y = \u03b1V$ (12)"}, {"title": "Spatial-Temporal Fusion", "content": "To integrate the temporal and spatial features, we introduce a gated fusion approach that controls the flow of information from both dimensions.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Automotive technology has advanced exponentially over the decades. From the traditional Motor wagon [1] that was drawn before the turn of the century to today's cars equipped with self-driving technology, we see advancement both in software and hardware of the chassis. Earlier we just needed the functionality for the engine strokes and aftertreatment functions. But now we need Over The Air(OTA) Software Update [2] capabilities and various other connectivity features [3]. The complexity of the architecture is also growing parallelly with this. More and more Electronic Control Units(ECUs) [4] are being embedded in the vehicle for extra features added. This is giving rise to complex connections and since all communication cant be hard wired through ethernet or CAN, there is a need to cluster the ECUs. This is where the concept of zonal architecture [5] comes into picture. 1 shows the internal vehicle structure with only fewer ECUs 2 shows the complex internal vehicle structure with many ECUs\nIn order to develop the next generation of Automotive vehicles, zonal architecture plays an important role. Major benefits are as follows:\n1) Performance Improvement: When it comes to self driving technology, perception of the environment is crucial and also the reaction times. Thus performance plays a major role.\n2) Scalability and Flexibility: If the architecture is scalable, then the addition and elimination of sensors and actuators is feasible. Maintenance cost is huge and debugging the cause of the issue can be time consuming and also huge costs on the pocket. Thus zonal architecture helps distribute processing power across zones and we can then localize to one area.\n3) Reliability: Redundant Chassis is a must today for every Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM) in order to launch a product into the market. Thus fallback mechanisms if one cluster fails need to be provided which is only possible with zonal architecture.\n4) Cost effectiveness: As highlighted above, cost saving is a major benefit of this architecture.As every ECU need not be connected to one another and need to be connected to the respective cluster which can then be decomposed within, the cost reduces significantly as wiring complexity goes down."}, {"title": "A. Literature Survey", "content": "The paper [6] talks about how zonal architecture where STRIDE is implemented which is a threat model to ensure security of OTA Updates in the In Vehicle Network. This paper shows the ease with which one can ensure security for software updates in complex vehicle networks with zonal architecture. There is some research also done on the real -time simulation side of things where Zonal DC systems are used [7]. This paper talks about how devices in zonal architecture can be controlled using a distributed and performing data communication network. This setup with Hardware in Loop helps in better testing of the zonal architecture in consideration.\nWe can consider any requirement today in a vehicle, safety, entertainment or driver assistance; the zones where the ECUs are placed, time synchronization has to be achieved. This is achieved through CAN-FD(Controller Area Network-Flexible Datarate) and Ethernet [8]. The testing is performed on embedded boards.\nAll the three papers discussed above show the need for a Zonal Architecture in vehicles and showcase some ways how this is simulated and tested for the latest features.\nMajor Contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 Analyse how the Automotive vehicle architecture has evolved over the years paving the way to Zonal Architectures"}, {"title": "II. NEURAL NETWORK NECESSITY FOR DRIVERLESS VEHICLES", "content": "We already discussed how Zonal Architecture helps segregate ECUs into clusters in order to simplify complex architecture. Going a level down, let us consider one of the important components of the next generation of driverless vehicles; sensor fusion. Sensor fusion involves processing huge amounts of sensor data through multiple streams coming from sensors like camera, Lidar(Light Detection and Ranging), Radar(Radio Detection and Ranging), Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU), GNSS(Global Navigation and Satellite System), Antenna and ultrasonics. Neural networks are employed here to make decisions with this data to be consumed by modules of perception, sensing, planning and control. There are two critical tasks that Neural Networks perform by consuming the sensor data:\n\u2022 Object Recognition: On the road and in traffic, neural networks breeze through a ton of visual information. They identify objects in the process like pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights and lane markings.\n\u2022 Scene Interpretation: Once the objects are recognized, the next step is to understand the context. For this, neural networks have to learn the relationships between the various identifies objects. They can then estimate speed, predict movement patterns of vehicles and pedestrians and anticipate any possible faults and possible threats to life. This can then kick in the safety mechanisms in the vehicle to ensure proper MRMs(Minimum Risk Maneuvers).\nThe environment has been perceived now and the next steps are to take critical corrective actions based on the scene interpretation above.\n\u2022 Steering and Navigation: NN(Neural Networks) have the capability to determine optimal traffic flow, identify road signs and subsequently their environment. Based on this information, NN helps maintaining speed, can change lanes for smoother journey and even apply brakes to avoid collision.\n\u2022 Route Planning and Optimization: Due to their capabilities to factor in real time data, weather conditions and even designated drop of zones in higher level of Autonomy, they plan the most efficient and safest route for the vehicle. The major advantage of these NNs is enhanced safety. With faster reaction times and more precise decision- making skills, NNs have successfully reduced accidents cause by human error by an exponential percentage. Autonomous vehicles powered by these systems can lead to safer driving experience worldwide."}, {"title": "III. ZONAL ARCHITECTURE: A DISTRIBUTED POWERHOUSE FOR SENSOR FUSION", "content": "Understanding the need to have multiple compute units in the vehicle for various driver assistance features is essential. From II, it is clear the necessity to have the driverless features in vehicles today. These features need complex architectures and Zonal architecture helps implement this.\nConventional car designs often use a centralized architecture, where all sensor data converges on a single powerful computer. This approach faces challenges:\n\u2022 Data Overload: The central computer can become overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data streaming from cameras, radars, lidar, and other sensors. This can lead to processing delays and hinder real-time decision-making.\n\u2022 Wiring Complexity: Connecting numerous sensors to a central unit requires a complex web of wires, increasing weight, maintenance costs, and the risk of malfunctions.\n\u2022 Limited Scalability: Adding new sensors or features becomes difficult as the central unit reaches its processing capacity.\nZonal architecture offers a smarter approach by dividing the vehicle into zones (e.g., front left, rear right). Each zone has its own dedicated processing unit responsible for:\n\u2022 Sensor Fusion: The zonal controller gathers data from various sensors within its zone and performs initial processing. This reduces the data load on the central computer and enables faster fusion of sensor information.\n\u2022 Local Decision-Making: The zonal controller can make basic decisions based on the fused sensor data, like initiating emergency braking if an obstacle is detected within the zone.\n\u2022 Simplified Wiring: Sensors connect to their designated zonal controller, reducing wiring complexity and improving overall system reliability.\nAdvantages of using Zonal Architecture in Self-Driving Cars: [10]\n\u2022 Enhanced Performance: quicker reaction times and more accurate perception of the environment.\n\u2022 Scalability and Flexibility: Adding new sensors or features becomes easier as processing power is distributed across zones. This allows for customization and adaptation to different driving environments.\n\u2022 Improved Reliability: It offers redundancy. If one zonal controller fails, the others can still function, enhancing overall system reliability.\n\u2022 Cost-Effectiveness: Reduced wiring complexity and the potential for using less powerful (and cheaper) zonal controllers can lead to cost savings in vehicle production."}, {"title": "A. Design Considerations for increased complexity", "content": "There are certain issues which need to be highlighted which occur in any vehicle architecture upon increased complexity. [11] This can happen in a typical connected vehicle or ADAS equipped vehicle. Integration nightmare is of utmost importance. As more ECUs start to communicate with each other, its is necessary to ensure seamless data exchange and avoid possible conflicts. Using traditional CAN networks, the bus will always be busy blocking the flow of communication. Thus domain gateways become necessary for broadcasting to occur. Sometimes data synchronization issues due to incorrect PTP(point to point) sync can give rise to compatibility issues. This can eventually cause system malfunction hard to recover from. Software management can cause huge mayhem. One example is let us assume every ECU is running its own software. This may come with its own versioning scheme as and when updated. This would cause updating and debugging software across multiple ECUs a time consuming and error-prone process. Power management is also another issue as every additional ECU added contributes to the overall power draw. This also strains the vehicle's electrical system and reduces fuel efficiency too. With multiple ECUs handling critical ADAS functions, ensuring overall system safety becomes paramount. A malfunction in one ECU could have cascading effects, compromising the entire ADAS system. Design Considerations for Effective ADAS Development:\n\u2022 Standardization is Key: Utilizing standardized communication protocols (like CAN FD) and software development tools simplifies integration and reduces compatibility issues between ECUs.\n\u2022 Virtualization Power: Leveraging virtualization technology allows multiple software applications to run on a single ECU, optimizing hardware usage and simplifying software management.\n\u2022 Modular Design Approach: Breaking down ADAS functionalities into smaller, modular components managed by individual ECUs improves maintainability and simplifies the development process.\n\u2022 Prioritization and Redundancy: Critical ADAS features should have dedicated ECUs with built-in redundancy to ensure system reliability and prevent cascading failures.\n\u2022 Focus on Security: As ECU complexity increases, so does the vulnerability to cyberattacks. Implementing robust security measures is crucial to protect vehicle systems from unauthorized access and manipulation. Addressing the challenges of growing ECU complexity requires a collaborative effort. Here's what the future holds:\n\u2022 Collaboration Between OEMs and Chipmakers: Collaboration between car manufacturers (OEMs) and chipmakers can lead to the development of more powerful and efficient ECUs specifically designed for ADAS applications. [12]\n\u2022 Standardization Efforts: Industry-wide adoption of standardized communication protocols and software development tools will further streamline ECU integration and simplify ADAS development."}, {"title": "B. Zonal Architecture for Electric Vehicle(EV) Design", "content": "Zonal architecture is a decentralization of electric controllers to several modular zones, or hardware gateways, located at points throughout the vehicle. Devices of various functions attach to the closest gateway, rather than with its domain grouping. With the converging automotive trends of vehicle electrification and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), the role of traditional automotive interconnects is evolving to meet more demanding performance requirements for key automotive application areas, including high-power interconnects specific to electric vehicles, and high-speed data interconnects required for ADAS control components which will ultimately evolve to fully autonomous vehicle systems.\nThe next generation of high-power automotive interconnects include those for vehicle batteries/drive trains, and other internal systems; as well as external connectors for EV charging stations designed to handle the larger vehicle batteries with higher amperages that deliver faster charging speeds. Advanced interconnects and wiring harnesses will be required to handle significantly increased bandwidth, multiple sensor inputs from cameras, LiDAR, and radar devices, all at higher data transfer speeds with more complex network architectures needed for ADAS and autonomous vehicle systems. Increased bandwidth and data transmission speeds are required for the next generation of advanced driver assistance systems, including vehicle safety devices such as sensors, cameras, radar/LiDAR, and telematics, as well as infotainment and other non-safety systems. The coaxial cables and interconnect wiring harnesses for these multiple sensors must have increased data capacity and transmission speeds to support the volume of this sensor data, especially as the automotive industry transitions from driver assisted systems to fully autonomous vehicles.\nOne standard automotive interconnect system involves the FAKRA (Fachkreis Automobil) connector family, developed to meet the stringent mechanical and environmental requirements of the automotive industry. These connectors are available in multiple configurations and feature keyed with color-coded designs for easy identification and to prevent mis-matching, with primary and secondary locking systems for secure connections. Rated for data speeds up to 8Gps, these connectors are ideal for developing wiring harnesses for high-speed one-way data transfer from sensors located within the vehicle, including cameras, GPS navigation, infotainment, RF keyless entry, and driver comfort systems. For safety-critical connections that require higher speed data transfer rates, wiring harnesses using the mini-FAKRA interconnect series supports up to 28Gbs data transmission. In addition to the higher data speeds, the mini-FAKRA connectors are more compact than standard FAKRA connectors, saving space and weight in vehicle electronics systems. Wiring harnesses using these connectors are ideal for autonomous driving and critical driver assistance systems, as they can deliver high data volumes from multiple sensors, cameras, and navigation sources. Traditional automotive electrical/electronic systems use a domain-based architecture, with specific modules, devices, and sensors wired to central ECUs (electronic control units). This approach can only scale up to a certain point before reaching limitations based on size, weight, and data transfer speeds. Newer automotive systems feature a zonal architecture using Ethernet cable specifically designed for automotive applications. Replacing"}, {"title": "C.

IMPACT ON VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS AND PROCEDURES", "content": "Troubleshooting and diagnosing faults is an important aspect when it comes to hardware in the vehicle. For Classical ECUs, there are set standards and methodologies. As complex ECUs are introduced the faults may occur across interconnected ECUs and will not be localized. This will take additional cost and time as well for technicians to debug the cause, design specialized tool for each domain and potentially will increase repair times.\nDiagnostic functionalities are majorly employed when flashing the ECU.Fault codes are limited for fixed errors. When the error count is unique to each ECU, additional software based mechanisms are needed to diagnose the ECU. In recent years, there has been evolution of Adaptive Autosar stack [13] and Service Oriented Vehicle Diagnostics [14] standard that enable diagnostics for complex architecture of ECUs. Zonal architecture helps in this by providing simplified diagnostics through a consolidated view of sensor data and system health within the zone. Faults can be identified quickly this way thus streamlining the diagnostic process. Standard communication protocol can be used across zones to simplify software update and maintenance. This enables single tool for all diagnostic activities simplifying the job of a technician. Fault can be isolated to specific zones. This reduces debug time minimizing component replacements. Major benefits are reduced downtime of the vehicle due to faster diagnostics and quicker repairs. Improved Repair efficiency, enhanced system transparency as system health can be viewed easily, design of easy zonal specific diagnostic tools and focus on OTA updates without in person visits to manufacturing unit."}, {"title": "V.

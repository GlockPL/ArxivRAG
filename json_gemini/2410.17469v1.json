To address this need, the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) has developed tools to simplify the construction and optimization of ML pipelines. However, existing AutoML solutions often lack efficiency in creating online pipelines and ease of use for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce AdaptoML-UX, an adaptive framework that incorporates automated feature engineering, machine learning, and incremental learning to assist non-Al experts in developing robust, user-centered ML models. Our toolkit demonstrates the capability to adapt efficiently to diverse problem domains and datasets, particularly in HCI, thereby reducing the necessity for manual experimentation and conserving time and resources. Furthermore, it supports model personalization through incremental learning, customizing models to individual user behaviors. HCI researchers can employ AdaptoML-UX (https://github.com/MichaelSargious/AdaptoML_UX) without requiring specialized expertise, as it automates the selection of algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning based on the unique characteristics of the data.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In today's data-driven world, machine learning models are extensively used across various domains. While several automated machine learning (AutoML) tools exist [2, 8, 11, 15], they are primarily designed for experts in machine learning (ML) and software engineering [7]. However, the interdisciplinary nature of human-computer interaction (HCI) research, which involves professionals from diverse fields such as psychology, journalism, and medicine, necessitates a more accessible toolkit for non-Al experts. To address this need, we introduce AdaptoML-UX, a toolkit specifically designed for non-specialists. It empowers users to control the machine learning pipeline and understand the underlying steps and modules without requiring extensive artificial intelligence (AI) or programming knowledge. Unlike existing AutoML frameworks, our user-friendly graphical design eliminates complex programming and debugging steps while providing clear visibility into the pipeline implementation (see Figure 1). This design ensures that users from various backgrounds can effectively engage with and utilize machine learning techniques. Furthermore, our toolkit incorporates incremental learning and model adaptation approaches, utilizing user-centered adaptive machine learning techniques specifically designed for human-centered artificial intelligence (HAI) [3-5, 16]. These features enable the toolkit to adapt to changing data distributions and user-specific behaviors, ensuring that the models remain relevant and accurate over time. In conclusion, AdaptoML-UX 1 automates crucial steps such as algorithm selection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, it incorporates adaptive capabilities and continual learning techniques, allowing for the development of personalized models that can adapt to dynamic data distributions and user-specific behavior. By making advanced machine learning techniques accessible to non-specialists, our toolkit bridges the gap between AI technology and interdisciplinary HCI research, fostering innovation and collaboration across diverse fields."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Our toolkit addresses several issues in current AutoML frameworks, including ease of use, a graphical user interface (GUI) for non-programmers, and automatic model adaptation and continual learning. We demonstrate these aspects in the following sections: \"Existing AutoML Frameworks\" and \"Existing Incremental Learning and Model Adaptation Toolkits\"."}, {"title": "2.1 Existing AutoML Frameworks", "content": "In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of AutoML, with various frameworks developed to streamline machine learning model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and architectural exploration [1, 2, 8, 11, 15]. These frameworks aim to simplify machine learning for novices, reduce the time and resources needed to build high-performing models, and accelerate the adoption of machine learning across different fields. Thornton et al. [15] introduced Auto-WEKA, which focuses on automating the selection of learning algorithms and hyperparameter configurations using Bayesian optimization. Similarly, Feurer et al. [2] developed AUTO-SKLEARN, an efficient AutoML framework built on scikit-learn. It includes numerous classifiers and preprocessing techniques, leveraging past performance data to improve model selection. Komer et al. [8] presented Hyperopt-sklearn, which uses the Hyperopt library to optimize algorithm configurations within the Scikit-learn library. Alternatively, Olson et al. [11] introduced TPOT, an AutoML framework that uses genetic programming to optimize machine learning pipelines. TPOT aims to enhance classification accuracy by evolving pipelines, but the genetic programming approach can be difficult for non-specialists to grasp. Finally, Celik et al. [1] created OAML to streamline pipeline construction for online learning and handle data drift. It explores various configurations of online learners and preprocessing methods.\nWhile these frameworks have proven valuable in various academic disciplines, they often pose challenges for non-expert users due to their complexity, extensive configuration options, and scripting-based methodologies that can overwhelm users without a strong ML and programming background. Additionally, unlike AdaptoML-UX, these methods are not capable of performing model adaptation and user personalization. AdaptoML-UX distinguishes itself by offering exceptional user-friendliness, specifically designed for non-experts in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and automates model adaptation and continual learning, making advanced machine learning accessible to a broader audience."}, {"title": "2.2 Existing Incremental Learning and Model Adaptation Toolkits", "content": "Incremental learning allows machine learning models to continuously update and improve as new data becomes available, without discarding previously learned knowledge. This capability is crucial for real-world applications where data is constantly evolving. Montiel et al. [10] developed Scikit-Multiflow to facilitate knowledge acquisition from data streams and multi-output learning. It integrates advanced learning techniques, data generators, and evaluators for diverse stream-learning scenarios. Despite its robust capabilities, the framework is highly modularized and requires extensive programming to use. Later, the same researchers created River [9], a framework designed to handle dynamic data streams and facilitate continual learning. River combines insights from the Creme [6] and Scikit-Multiflow approaches to create a comprehensive framework for machine learning on continuously generated data. However, it suffers from the same drawbacks as previous approaches in terms of ease of use and simplicity in design.\nHCI researchers have also studied several design approaches for continual learning and personalization using their own tools. Putze et al. [13] focused on identifying and mitigating obstacles in human-computer interactions (HCI) using various data modalities. They emphasized the importance of customization and adaptation"}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "In this section, we outline the methodology employed in the development and design of the AdaptoML-UX toolkit. The overall workflow of the toolkit involves several key steps, including data imputation, feature selection, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, incremental learning, and automated model adaptation for various participants in user studies. AdaptoML-UX is implemented in Python, incorporating essential machine learning libraries to provide a robust framework for adaptive machine learning. The design of AdaptoML-UX focuses on a user-friendly interface that guides users through the machine learning process. The user need to identify four mandatory parameters: the dataset file, the labels column, the adaptation (e.g., a user-centered personalization) column, and whether a regression or classification task is required (see Figure 1).\nAdaptoML-UX begins with the imputation step, addressing any missing values in the data. Following this, it performs feature selection or extraction based on user-defined flags, ensuring that the most relevant features are utilized for model training. It automatically perform a grid search over various preprocessing methods, machine learning models, and hyperparameter similar to previous AutoML tools. Then, unlike previous AutoML frameworks, the toolkit can automatically perform an extra step of model adaptation and personalization based on certain users or user groups using incremental learning approaches. The GUI is designed to simplify the workflow, allowing users to easily configure and execute these steps without requiring specialized knowledge in machine learning. Additionally, the AdaptoML-UX framework offers users a range of configurable parameters for data preproceesing, feature engineering, and supervised learning methods. In the \"Data Preprocessing Section\", users can set data imputation methods, define test and validation data sizes, and apply normalization procedures. The \"Feature Engineering Section\" allows users to enable feature extraction and selection, and store processed features in CSV or Pickle formats. The \"Classifiers and Regressors Section\" provides options for selecting classification or regression tasks, loading pre-trained models, activating model adaptation, specifying model fitting parameters, and utilizing incremental learning.

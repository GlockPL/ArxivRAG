The images are 1024x1024 in size, and we used them without any downsampling or preprocessing. For pretraining, we randomly selected 25,000 images from this dataset. To generate the ground truth for weakly supervised pretraining, we extracted texture maps from the face images and masked out non-facial areas to produce the final texture masks for ground truth (Figure 1-a). For finetuning, 500 face images were randomly selected. The ground truth for supervised finetuning consisted of manually annotated wrinkle masks. The wrinkle annotation process involved three annotators, all highly experienced in image processing and analysis. Recognizing the subjective nature of wrinkle identification, a consistent standard was established prior to the commencement of labeling. During the labeling, specific emphasis was placed on annotating wrinkles in key facial areas including the forehead, crow's feet, and nasolabial folds. To mitigate inter-rater variability and enhance the reliability of the ground truth, a majority voting mechanism was implemented, where only pixels labeled by at least two groups were retained (Figure 1-b). We allocated 80% of the dataset for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.\n\nFigure 2 shows the entire training pipeline. Initially, we trained the segmentation network in a weakly supervised manner using texture masks and subsequently finetuned it in a supervised manner using manually labeled masks. The training was performed using U-Net\u0151 architecture. During the weakly supervised pretraining stage, the model learns to output texture masks from face images, receiving images as input and producing texture masks as output (Figure 2-a). Then, in the supervised finetuning stage, the model learned to classify each pixel of a face image as either a wrinkle or not, using images and texture maps as inputs and producing two output classes that generate logit values for background and wrinkles, respectively (Figure 2-b)."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Table 1 displays JSI of our method compared to training exclusively with manual data (no pretraining). Our method demonstrates improved performance by 1.92%, 0.35%, 1.06%, and 8.53% for datasets comprising 100%, 50%, 25%, and 5% of the data, respectively. Additionally, our method demonstrates a significant performance improvement over methods pretrained with self-supervised learning techniques (Table 2). This highlights the efficacy of our proposed method in enhancing the accuracy of wrinkle segmentation, particularly in scenarios with sparse data availability. Figure 3 provides a visual performance of our methodology."}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "We propose a reliable ground truth generation strategy and an efficient transfer learning approach. During the weakly supervised pretraining stage, the model learns to highlight skin features such as edges and textures. In the supervised finetuning stage, the model develops the capability to accurately discern wrinkle regions from edges and textures. Through this effective learning strategy, we can enhance the efficiency of wrinkle segmentation even with limited data, thereby achieving reliable wrinkle segmentation outcomes. However, despite majority voting, the subjectivity in wrinkle annotation remains a challenge. We plan to involve dermatologists in the wrinkle annotation process and research reliable label combination methods, such as label smoothing, to improve the reliability of manual wrinkle masks."}]}

Rom\u00e1n", "Morgan Weeks", "Fiona Xue Ju"], "abstract": "This pictorial aims to critically consider the nature of text-to-audio and text-to-music generative tools in the context of explainable AI. As a group of experimental musicians and researchers, we are enthusiastic about the creative potential of these tools and have sought to understand and evaluate them from perspectives of prompt creation, control, usability, understandability, explainability of the AI process, and overall aesthetic effectiveness of the results. One of the challenges we have identified that is not explicitly addressed by these tools is the inherent semantic gap in using text-based tools to describe something as abstract as music. Other gaps include explainability vs. useability, and user control and input vs. the human creative process. The aim of this pictorial is to raise questions for discussion and make a few general suggestions on the kinds of improvements we would like to see in generative AI music tools.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "As a group of experimental musicians, we are interested in exploring cutting-edge digital tools and technologies that have the potential to enhance music composition, performance, and production. The recent development of text-to-sound Al tools offer many possibilities for artistic creation, but also raises many questions regarding the aesthetic and ethical implications of their usage. Through evaluating prominent, publicly available text-to-audio and text-to-music generative Al tools [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], we seek to understand and compare their general implications from various perspectives, including prompt creating, control, usability, understandability, explainability of the AI process, and overall effectiveness of the results.\nIn order to respond to these tools, each member of our group experimented individually, exploring different prompt styles and inputs, taking into account the degree of explainability in the processes used to generate the audio."}, {"title": "THE GAP: SEMANTIC AND OTHERWISE", "content": "When generating artistic material, AI models must deal with the technical knowledge and specialized vocabulary associated with various artistic domains. In music generation, familiarity with music theory, instrumentation, sound descriptors and genre conventions is indispensable. Unlike other forms of data, such as text or images, many musical elements defy precise and well-defined description. This causes a 'semantic gap' [6]. The semantic gap poses a significant challenge for generative Al music tools in dealing with the subjective nature of musical description and expression. This gap is expanded by culture-specific musical descriptions. Prompt inputs have become one of the most widely used methods of interfacing with generative AI tools [7]. They allow users to interface with AI tools without needing to understand their inner workings. The semantic gap between language and music means that linguistic prompts may fail to capture the abstractness of musical ideas. While prompt refinement offers a degree of control, the distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" prompts in music creation remains ambiguous. Text-to-audio and text-to-music tools face the challenge of capturing musical ideas, translating them into words, and translating them back into coherent sonic material.\nAn interesting prospect lies in the ability to fine-tune Al sound generation systems to the users' own sets of descriptors, categories, or tags. By aligning the system's output with users' unique preferences and vocabularies, generative Al tools could offer a more personalized and intuitive creative experience. Explaining the relationship between user descriptors and Al responses could bring greater transparency and interpretability in the generative process."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "As we conclude our exploration of practical issues in generative Al tools for sound and music creation, it becomes evident that certain challenges, such as the semantic gap, are unlikely to be fully resolved in a text-to-sound generative model. Moreover, while text-to-sound and prompt engineering approaches offer some degree of intuitive control over the creative process, they may not represent the optimal paradigm for interacting with a generative music tool.\nThat these tools are designed to create full songs generated from scratch raises questions about whether this kind of outcome can align with a human-centered approach to AI.\nAs AI systems increasingly make decisions traditionally reserved for human creators, concerns arise regarding the ethical and aesthetic implications of delegating creative agency to algorithms. Against this background the threat of Al tools replacing human creation, especially in commercial spheres, continues to grow.\nWithout transparency regarding the sources from which the generative AI tools are being trained, concerns about plagiarism and artistic integrity remain unresolved.\nSome of the improvements we would like to see in these tools include clearer articulation of their methodologies and limitations, user interfaces that allow musicians to draw on their expertise, and, perhaps most importantly, transparency in where and who the training data is coming from.\nWe hope that this pictorial will contribute to the discourse of explainable and human-centered AI in the arts, as well as leading to further discussion, collaboration, and creation."}]}

The\nchallenge is not just technological but deeply emotional, ethical, and cognitive. Across\nvarious fields\u2014from healthcare and consumer products to workplace dynamics and cultural\nsectors-the focus has shifted to developing Al technologies to deploying systems that\npromote trust, empathy, and seamless cooperation between humans and machines.\n\nThe aim of this Special Issue is to deepen our understanding of the psychology of design,\nparticularly in how we approach and create Al interfaces such as chatbots, robotics, IoT\ndevices, Al assistants, and more. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are\ntransformative technologies that organizations worldwide are increasingly investing in. Al\ncan replicate tasks requiring human intelligence by leveraging probabilistic outcomes based\non real-world data to predict future scenarios. ML processes vast amounts of data to\ndevelop and validate decision-making logic, often inspired by biological neuron signals, as\nseen in deep learning or natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, no-code tools now\nenable business analysts to make ML predictions without prior expertise. This Special Issue\nexamines the role of Al in shaping human perception and inference, with a focus on\ndesigning the ideal machine-human experience.\n\nUser perception can vary widely due to individual differences, environmental factors, and\ncultural influences, all of which impact user experiences. User inferences are the mental\nprocesses that enable individuals to draw conclusions, make judgments, and generate new\nknowledge based on the information they encounter. Together, perception and inferences\nshape the overall user experience. In Al, designing systems that are transparent, intuitive,\nand aligned with users' needs and expectations is critical. With the rapid growth of\ntechnological investment and innovation in this field, the need for research has become\neven more pressing\u2014particularly from a design and product development perspective. User\nexperience research plays a key role in bridging the gap between Al and its users. Beyond\nbasic usability, it addresses critical factors such as user mental models, trust, and\ntransparency. This includes exploring how psychology can inform the design of\nmachine-human interfaces, as well as the personalization and adaptability of Al assistants,\namong other considerations.\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of interacting with Al is the language it uses in messaging or\npersuasion attempts. Despite its importance, we know relatively little about the psychology\nof Al experience design. Research on how marketers communicate with consumers\nhighlights robust effects of factors like message tone (Sundar & Cao, 2018; Sundar & Paik,\n2017), message repetition (Sundar, Kardes & Wright, 2015), and language structure and\ncategorization (Schmitt & Zhang, 1998). While scholars have explored the anthropomorphic\nrelationships individuals form with Al assistants (Uysal, Alavi, & Benzencon, 2022), how\npeople react to and respond to Al remains underexplored. This Special Issue seeks to bridge\ndisciplines such as communication, marketing, and judgment and decision-making to better\nunderstand these dynamics. Research in this area aims to uncover how humans perceive\ncommunication, particularly when claims originate from Al assistants or sources not\nperceived as human.\n\nThis Special Issue explores the evolving relationship between AI, ML, and human behavior. It\nfeatures articles that delve into the complexities of Al-human interactions, potential human\nperceptions, and insights to enhance machine learning and inferences on both sides of the\ninteraction-paving the way for meaningful technological advancements. Highlighting the\nrole of Al and ML in the digital evolution of computing, this issue emphasizes the\npsychological and human responses to transformative digital technologies."}, {"title": "Insights from this Issue", "content": "Affective communication forms the foundation of an ideal Al-human experience, as explored\nin Affective Foundations in Al-Human Interactions (Liu et al., 2024). The researchers argue\nthat for Al to evolve beyond mere task execution, it must connect with human emotions in\nmeaningful ways. Drawing from evolutionary biology and interspecies communication, they\npropose models for Al that resonate with universal affective pathways. These insights\nunderline the necessity of moving beyond human-like cognition toward a design where Al\ncan genuinely empathize with its users, establishing trust and intuitive interaction. This idea\nof an emotional bridge between humans and machines is critical for envisioning future Al\ninterfaces.\n\nYet, trust is a double-edged sword, as highlighted in Evaluating Privacy, Security, and Trust\nPerceptions in Conversational Al (Leschanowsky et al., 2024). Even as conversational Al\nsystems, such as voice assistants, become more integrated into daily life, users remain wary\nabout privacy, security, and trust. The study emphasizes the importance of reliable, validated\nmetrics for gauging these concerns, urging designers to consider not only how Al interfaces\nperform but also how they are perceived in terms of safety and privacy. This connection\nbetween emotional resonance and trust speaks to a broader need for Al interfaces that\nrespect user boundaries while offering personalized interactions.\n\nAs Al systems become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, transparency in their\noperations becomes crucial. However, The Transparency-Resistance Paradox in Algorithmic\nManagement (Hu et al., 2024) reveals the complexities of this challenge in algorithm-driven\ngig work. While transparency may initially improve worker satisfaction, too much\ntransparency can lead to resistance, complicating the Al-human relationship. This paradox\nraises an important point: designing Al interfaces for the workplace must balance efficiency\nwith human factors like fairness and empathy, suggesting that the ideal machine-human\ninterface may not always be hyper-transparent, but rather sensitive to human emotional\nthresholds. The proposed model of \"Human-Algorithm Co-management\" reflects this, where\nAl's cold logic is tempered by human empathy, reinforcing that an optimal interface must\nintegrate human warmth with machine precision.\n\nConsumer technology interfaces also face similar challenges, particularly in framing and\npresenting Al to users. When Being Smart Trumps (Smale et al., 2024) explores consumer"}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "Across these diverse fields, the narrative remains clear: the design of Al interfaces must go\nbeyond efficiency and functionality. Whether in consumer products, healthcare, workplace\nmanagement, or cultural heritage, the ideal Al interface fosters emotional connection,\nbalances transparency with trust, and carefully frames the Al's role to reduce anxiety. The\nfuture of Al-human interactions depends on designing interfaces that not only perform but\nalso resonate emotionally, acknowledging human needs for empathy, fairness, and intuitive\ncommunication. The challenge lies in ensuring that these Al systems, while powerful and\nadvanced, remain fundamentally human in their touch.\n\nWhile this collective body of research presents valuable insights and directions, there is still\nwork to be done in providing the kind of practical, hands-on guidance that UX designers and\nproduct managers need to implement these ideas effectively. Theoretical models and\nhigh-level findings offer a necessary foundation, but the next phase in Al interface design\nmust focus on translating these insights into concrete, actionable strategies. Industry\nprofessionals are seeking tools, frameworks, and best practices that can be applied directly\nto product development-making this a critical gap that needs addressing. As Al becomes\nmore integral to everyday experiences, bridging this gap between research and practical\napplication will be essential in creating Al systems that truly enhance human lives."}]}

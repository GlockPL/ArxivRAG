Despite this progress, the field currently encounters two main challenges: (1) the lack of a comprehensive LLM agent framework adaptable to a variety of financial tasks, and (2) the absence of standardized benchmarks and consistent datasets for assessing agent performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce INVESTORBENCH, the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLM-based agents in diverse financial decision-making contexts. INVESTORBENCH enhances the versatility of LLM-enabled agents by providing a comprehensive suite of tasks applicable to different financial products, including single equities like stocks, cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, we assess the reasoning and decision-making capabilities of our agent framework using thirteen different LLMs as backbone models, across various market environments and tasks. Furthermore, we have curated a diverse collection of open-source, multimodal datasets and developed a comprehensive suite of environments for financial decision-making. This establishes a highly accessible platform for evaluating financial agents' performance across various scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The recent studies on large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated impressive performance across a range of decision-making tasks in complex and open-ended environments spanning various domains (Zhang et al., 2024b; Guo et al., 2024; Eigner and H\u00e4ndler, 2024; Wang et al., 2024). However, developing agentic frameworks tailored specifically for financial decision-making remains a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the need for agents to acutely discern and prioritize decisive signals, and then make sequentially sources and varying time sensitivities, allowing the agent to naturally adapt to complex financial tasks. INVESTORBENCH expands its evaluation beyond the original stock trading tasks to encompass three decision tasks significant in the realm of financial investment: stock trading, cryptocurrency trading, and ETF investing.\nIn summary, we make three key contributions:\n1) We establish INVESTORBENCH, an innovative and comprehensive financial agentic benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and sequential decision-making capabilities of LLM-based agents in complex, open-ended financial scenarios. This benchmark provides a realistic perspective for assessing the design and performance of such agents.\n2) We provide a set of open-source, multi-source market environments that closely mirror real-world conditions. Furthermore, these environments also serve as a standardized platform for evaluating the decision-making performance of other LLM-based financial agents. 3) We present a unified, flexible language-agent framework that allows finance professionals to conveniently customize assess any LLMs serving as the agent's reasoning core. In this paper, we conduct a holistic evaluation of 13 LLMs including recent, competitive, and domain-specific fine-tuned models (see Table 1) to provide a broad overview of their reasoning capabilities in sequential decision-making tasks within financial contexts."}, {"title": "2 LLM Trading Agents", "content": "In this section, we define a framework of the LLM-based agents in the INVESTORBENCH and formalize the financial decision-making tasks within the context of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) (Bertsekas and Shreve, 1996; Liu et al., 2020; Kabbani and Duman, 2022)."}, {"title": "2.1 Definition", "content": "The LLM-based agent in INVESTORBENCH is structured as a large language model-modulo framework, designed to match or surpass the capabilities of professional human investors. This framework consists of several interconnected modules, each tailored to handle the distinct challenges presented by the financial market's volatility and complexity:Brain/Backbone (LLM): This module, which is the LLM itself, serves as the core of the LLM-based agent. It enhances the agent's capabilities by enabling it to understand, process, and generate natural language. This module plays a crucial role in supporting complex decision-making processes, offering interpretations of market-related information, generating predictive analytics, and reflecting on past investment decisions.\nPerception: This module serves a critical function by converting raw market data into a structured format that is compatible with the LLM, specifying what the agent perceives and observes, which includes numerical, textual, and visual information.\nProfile: This module serves two functions articulated in natural language. Firstly, it describes the agent's role, highlighting its character as an experienced investor with expert-level knowledge and a self-adaptive risk preference. This risk preference dynamically adjusts based on historical market momentum, allowing the agent to optimize its strategies in real time. Secondly, the module provides a detailed background of the decision-making task, specifying the key characteristics and pertinent information about the target assets involved in the trading decisions, such as equity historical performance, price fluctuations, and sector information. This dual-function module supports the agent's decisions with both the current market context and its historical performance.\nMemory: This module processes and retains essential market data and historical insights, allowing the agent to draw on a rich repository of knowledge for decision-making. Building upon the pioneering work of Yu et al. (2024a) in FINMEM, the memory architecture comprises two primary components: Working Memory and Layered Long-Term Memory, as depicted in Figure 2.\nWorking memory: This component maintains FINMEM's original functionalities: observation, summarization, and reflection. It incorporates two reflection mechanisms: immediate and extended. Immediate reflection produces the agent's reasoning outcomes by integrating current market indicators with the top-K ranked events from each long-term memory layer, which are significant during both warm-up and evaluation stages. In the warm-up stage, the emphasis shifts as the trading direction is predetermined, focusing on understanding market trends and enhancing predictive accuracy. In the evaluation stage, it outputs the trading direction (Buy, Sell, or Hold), the rationale for this decision, identifying the most influential memory events and their respective IDs from each layer.\nLayered Long-Term Memory: Inspired by the human cognitive system's varying information decay speeds, Layered Long-Term Memory component structures financial insights across multiple layers. Each layer is represented by a vector database in the Long-Term Memory data warehouse, where information is prioritized and purged based on a specific decay rate. Deeper layers retain information longer with smaller decay rates, while shallower layers, dealing with more transient data, have larger decay rates. This tiered approach is critical as it allows the adaptation of the memory architecture to a broader range of financial tasks beyond single-asset decisions, accommodating an expanded variety of data sources and increasing overall system flexibility. Detailed mechanisms for ranking and decay in each layer are further elaborated in the Appendix A.\nAction: This module executes trading and investment decisions based on the analysis provided by other modules. It directly outputs {\u201cBuy\u201d, \u201cSell"}], "asset": "Buy", "Sell\", or \u201cHold\".

This agent is enhanced with external tools (such as tabular data readers and API callers) and data operations (including vector database management, information reinforcement, and retrieval).\n(3) Financial Decision-Making Tasks: INVESTORBENCH offers three distinct financial decision-making tasks, differentiated by their asset types.\n(4) Evaluation Metrics: The efficacy of all tasks within INVESTORBENCH is evaluated using a set of standard metrics in the quantitative finance field, providing a thorough evaluation of the decision-making capabilities of the LLM-based agent."}, {"title": "3.2 Trading Environments", "content": "We release three datasets, each curated from diverse sources, to construct tailored financial market environments for specific tasks. Our objective is to address the current gap in evaluation environments for financial decision-making agent frameworks and to offer a fully open platform for the comprehensive assessment of agents across various tasks. Below, we introduce each environment, categorized by task type, detailing its scope and the data sources it incorporates."}, {"title": "3.3 Evaluation metrics", "content": "We employ four widely recognized financial metrics to evaluate and compare the investment performance of various LLMs serving as backbones across different tasks: : Cumulative Return (CR) (Hull, 2007), Sharpe Ratio (SR) (Sharpe, 1994), Annualized Volatility (AV) (Cochrane, 1988), and Maximum Drawdown(MDD) (Ang and Chen, 2003). Note that CR and the SR are often considered more essential than AV and MDD in evaluating asset trading performance due to their focus on long-term gains and risk-adjusted returns by their definition. Here, we regard these two metrics as primary metrics when evaluating the experiment outcomes."}, {"title": "4 Experiment and Discussion", "content": null}, {"title": "4.1 Experiment Setup", "content": "Table 1 summarizes the performance of a comprehensive list of trading agents. For single equity tasks, the baseline is set up by Buy and Hold strategy, while for portfolio management task, it is set up by an equal-weight portfolio with the detailed rational explained in Appendix. In our experiments, the temperature parameter of all LLM-based agent systems is set at 0.6 to balance response consistency and reasoning creativity. The performance metrics are reported for the test trajectory with the median CR, SR, AV, and MDD from five repeated epochs. (If the median of these metrics does not belong to the same epoch, the performance is based on the trajectory with the median SR.)\nFurthermore, the selection of warm-up and test periods differs across various tasks due to the varying time spans of data collected to construct the agent environment. For the single-asset trading tasks, the warm-up period of stock trading is from 2020-07-01 to 2020-09-30 and the test period is from 2020-10-01 to 2021-05-06. The warm-up period of cryptocurrency trading is from 2023-02-11 to 2023-04-04 and the test period is from 2023-04-05 to 2023-11-05. The warm-up period of ETF trading is from 2019-07-29 to 2019-12-30 and the test period is from 2020-01-02 to 2020-09-21.\nFor LLM deployment, we utilize vllm to deploy LLMs. For small-scale LLMs (under 10B parameters), we deploy models on two RTX A6000 GPUs, each with 48GB DRAM. For mid-scale LLMS (10B to 65B parameters), we use four RTX A6000 GPUs. For large-scale LLMs (over 65B parameters), models are deployed on eight A100 GPUs, each equipped with 80GB DRAM."}, {"title": "4.2 Result 1: Stock Trading", "content": "Table 2 presents the performance of thirteen backbone models across seven stocks, accompanied by the average of each metric for all stocks to offer a more comprehensive view of their overall performance. We outline three key insights as follows:\nSuperior stock trading performance is achieved with proprietary LLMs as agent backbones\nCompared to agents employing open-source or financial-domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs, those using the three proprietary LLMs demonstrated significantly higher and more consistent average CR and SR, as shown in Figure 3a. Despite being fine-tuned with extensive financial contexts, domain-specific LLMs did not provide a decisive advantage in sequential stock trading decision-making tasks. This may be attributed to their primary training for other functions, such as long financial report analysis exemplified by Palmyra-Fin-70B, rather than decision-making.\nModel parameter size increment enhances agent financial decision-making quality and robustness. In the category of open-source LLMs, those exceeding 67B parameters displayed superior CRs and SRs, along with markedly less variance within their category, as illustrated in Figure 3b and Table 2. This underscores the prevailing belief that the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are proportionate to their parameter size, which holds also true in stock trading, which is a sequential decision-making task in an open-ended, volatile environment by nature.\nProprietary models exhibit significantly stronger decision-making capabilities compared to even the largest open-source LLMs under complex, mixed market conditions, though this advantage is less evident in relatively monotone market environments. During the test phase, primarily influenced by the range of open-source data collected, TSLA and NIO exhibited volatility with mixed upward and downward stock price trends, whereas the other five stocks generally showed bullish trends. The investment signals derived from such complex markets tend to be noisy or delayed, as illustrated in Appendix C. We observed that proprietary models possess a superior ability to manage these challenging conditions and consistently deliver better performance outcomes than large-sized open-source LLMs. Their reasoning capability enables them to effectively utilize other decision-relevant information, such as historical momentum, current holdings, and, most critically, self-reflection outcomes from the agents, thereby facilitating more accurate decisions."}, {"title": "4.3 Result 2 & 3: Cryptocurrency Trading and ETF Trading", "content": "In the test phases of both cryptocurrency and ETF trading tasks, market trends are mixed. Notably, the cryptocurrency task shows significantly smaller price fluctuations compared to the ETF task. We outline the key features of using an LLM-agent to make financial decisions across these two distinct markets as follows:\nLarge-sized open-source models and proprietary models are needed to effectively capture trading signals of cryptocurrency markets, which are highly sensitive to news and financial sentiment. As shown in Table 3, using mid-sized and small-sized open-source models as the decision-making agent backbone generally results in weaker performance than the market baseline with respect to CR and SR.\nETF investment requires proprietary models enriched with extensive pre-trained knowledge to serve as the agent's \u201cbrain\" and provide robust reasoning support. As shown in Table 4, proprietary models significantly outperform open-source and financial domain-specific models in this task. This advantage arises from the complexity of ETF trading, which necessitates interpreting actionable signals across diverse sectors, demanding more strategic, long-term decisions grounded in deep comprehension and reflection anchored by rich pre-contexts."}, {"title": "4.4 Discussion", "content": "Combining all the experimental results, we find that the performance of different LLM varies significantly in stock, cryptocurrency, and ETF trading.

Concurrently, the advancement of LLMs has significantly enhanced the development of language-based agent frameworks in the financial sector, such as FINMEM (Yu et al., 2024a), FINAGENT (Zhang et al., 2024a) and FINROBOT (Yang et al., 2024), characterized by their adaptability and openness. However, variations in framework design, task scope, and data types present challenges in uniformly evaluating the efficacy of LLM agents in financial scenarios."}, {"title": "5.2 Financial LLM Benchmarks", "content": "In the realm of financial LLMs, several benchmarks have been developed: FLUE (Shah et al., 2022) introduces the first comprehensive benchmark with five financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, headline classification, named entity recognition, structure boundary detection, and question answering.

FinBen (Xie et al., 2024) encompasses 36 datasets covering 24 financial tasks. Despite these advancements, there remains a notable gap in benchmarks specifically designed for LLM-based agent applications within the financial sector."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "INVESTORBENCH offers the community two distinct modes of engagement. The first mode allows participants to integrate their fine-tuned LLMs into the INVESTORBENCH's agent framework to undertake financial decision-making tasks. This setup enables them to benchmark the performance of their models against those previously experimented with by our work. The second mode permits users to directly incorporate the environment and evaluation metrics of INVESTORBENCH into their own designed agents, facilitating a comparative analysis of their agent design's effectiveness. This dual approach provides a flexible framework for testing and enhancing financial decision-making strategies within the INVESTORBENCH ecosystem.\nFuture research efforts will expand the benchmark by incorporating additional information modalities, such as audio (e.g., earnings call recordings) and graphs (e.g., K-lines, trade charts), to explore whether these data types can enhance decision-making quality. The foundational agent framework of INVESTORBENCH is designed to seamlessly accommodate these modalities, ensuring that the extended benchmark remains easy to use and scalable."}, {"title": "Limitation", "content": "First, INVESTORBENCH is currently focusing on single-asset financial decision-making task, without addressing multi-asset tasks such as portfolio management.

These events are selected based on their information retrieval score, $f$, where l represents the layer (shallow, intermediate, or deep), as defined in Equation 2.\n$E_{Vi}^{l} = S_{Recency_{l}}^{E} + S_{Relevancy_{l}}^{E} + S_{Importance_{l}}^{E}, (2)$\nwhere each memory event is only associated with one score and can only belong to a single layer.\nLet E denote a given memory event. The scoring mechanism for E, adapted from Park et al. (Park et al., 2023) but with modified recency and importance computations, is tailored to handle data with various timelines and to achieve layered processing that represents the diverse periodicities of the financial environment. This score encapsulates three metrics: recency (how recently the event occurred), relevancy (the event's pertinence to the current context), and importance (the event's significance). Individual metric scores exceeding 1.0 are scaled to the [0,1] range before being summed, ensuring a balanced contribution from each component and preventing any single metric from dominating the overall score. The resulting composite score provides a comprehensive evaluation of the memory event's significance within the multi-layered, periodically varying financial landscape.\n$S_{Recency_{l}}^{E} = e^{Q_{l} \\cdot \\frac{t_{p} - t_{E}}{T_{i}}},(3)$\nwhere $t_{E}$ represents the time elapsed between a memory event's occurrence and the trading inquiry's arrival. The model utilizes three processing layers, each corresponding to a specific timeframe: shallow ($Q_{shallow}$ = 14 days), intermediate ($Q_{intermediate}$ = 90 days), and deep ($Q_{deep}$ = 365 days). These intervals represent two weeks, a quarter, and a year respectively.\nWhen a trade inquiry P arrives in processing layer l via an LLM prompt, the agent calculates the recency score $S_{Recency_{l}}^{E}$ for a memory event E using Equation 3. This score inversely correlates with the time elapsed between the inquiry and the event's memory timestamp, mapping to Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve (Murre and Dros, 2015). The stability term $Q_{l}$ in Equation 3 modulates memory decay rates across layers, with higher values in deeper layers indicating longer memory persistence. For instance, in the trading context, company annual reports (e.g., Form 10-Ks) are assigned higher stability values and categorized within deeper processing layers compared to daily financial news, reflecting their extended timeliness, relevance, and impact on financial decision-making.\n$S_{Relevancy} = \\frac{m_{E} \\cdot m_{P}}{||m_{E}||^{2}X ||m_{P} ||^{2}}, (4)$\nThe relevancy score $S_{Relevancy}$ quantifies the semantic similarity between a memory event E and the current query P using cosine similarity of their respective embedding vectors, $m_{E}$ and $m_{P}$, as shown in Equation 4. These embeddings are generated from the event's textual content and the LLM prompt query (which includes trading inquiries and the agent's character setting) using OpenAI's \"text-embedding-ada-003\" model.\nThe importance score $S_{importancel}$ for a memory event E in layer l is calculated as the product of a value $v_{f}$ (derived from a uniform piecewise scoring function, Equation 5) and a degrading ratio $\\theta_{l}$ (Equation 6), as shown in Equation 7. This approach, adapted from (Park et al., 2023), is tailored to our stratified long-term memory structure. The likelihood of higher $v_{f}$ values increases from shallow to deep layers, while $\\theta_{l}$ measures the diminishing importance of an event over time using layerspecific exponential functions. The base $a_{l}$ for each layer follows $a_{shallow}$ < $a_{intermediate}$ < $a_{deep}$ (set to 0.9, 0.967, and 0.988 respectively), ensuring $\\theta_{l}$ decreases to a threshold of 5 after 30, 90, and 365 days for shallow, intermediate, and deep layers. This layered approach, implemented through three-piece-wise functions for both $S_{Importancel}^{E}$ and $S_{Recency_{l}}^{E}$, enables FinMem to process longterm memory in a stratified manner. Memory events are purged when $S_{Recency_{l}}^{E}$ falls below 0.05 or $S_{Importance_{l}}^{E}$ is under 5 (pre-scaling), maintaining the relevance and efficiency of the memory store.\n$v_{f}^{E} = {\\begin{cases}\n40 \\text{ with probability } p_{1}\\\\\n60 \\text{ with probability } p_{2}\\\\\n80 \\text{ with probability } p_{3}\n\\end{cases}}(5)$\n$\\theta_{l} = (a_{l})^{(\\Delta t)}  \\Delta t = {shallow, intermediate, deep}, (6)$\nwhere $p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3}$ = 1, but their values vary by shallow, intermediate, and deep processing. when shallow processing $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ = {0.8, 0.15, 0.05}, intermediate processing, $p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ = {0.05, 0.8, 0.15} and deep processing,$p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}$ = {0.05, 0.15, 0.8}.\n$S_{Importancel}^{E} = \\sqrt[4]{v_{f}^{E}} * \\theta_{l},(7)$\nFurthermore, FINMEM employs an access counter function to dynamically manage memory events across layers, ensuring that crucial events influencing trading decisions are elevated to deeper layers for extended retention and recurring access. This process, monitored by the LLM validation tool Guardrails AI, tracks critical memory IDs across layers. Events deemed pivotal for investment success receive a 5-point boost to their importance score ($S_{Importancel}$). Upon meeting upgrade criteria for a deeper layer, an event's recency score ($S_{Recency,E}$) is reset to 1.0, underscoring its significance and preventing rapid decay. Conversely, less relevant events gradually fade. This mechanism allows FINMEM to efficiently identify, prioritize, and retain key events based on their nature and retrieval frequency, while gradually phasing out less impactful information, thereby maintaining a dynamic and relevant memory structure for financial decision-making."}, {"title": "B Details on Evaluation Metrics", "content": "Below is a brief overview of these metrics:\nCumulative Return (CR) % measures the total value change of an investment over time by summing daily logarithmic returns, shown in Equation 8.

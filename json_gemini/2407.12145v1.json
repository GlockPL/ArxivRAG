High-performing students are the ones who are using ChatGPT the most. So, a new digital trench could be rising be-tween these students and those with lower degree of fundamentals and worse prompting skills, who may not take advantage of all the ChatGPT possibilities. Background: The irruption of GenAI such as ChatGPT has changed the educational landscape. Therefore, methodological guidelines and more empirical experiences in computer science education are needed to better understand these tools and know how to use them to their fullest potential. Research Questions: This article addresses three questions. The first two explore the degree of use and perceived usefulness of ChatGPT among computer science students to learn database administration, where as the third one explore how the utilization of ChatGPT can impact academic performance. Methodology: This contribution presents an exploratory and correlational study conducted with 37 students who used ChatGPT as a support tool to learn database administration. The student's grades and a comprehensive questionnaire were employed as research instruments. Findings: The obtained results indicate that traditional learning resources, such as teacher's explanations and student's reports, were widely used and correlated positively with student's grade. The usage and perceived utility of ChatGPT were moderate, but positive correlations between student's grade and ChatGPT usage were found. Indeed, a significantly higher use of this tool was identified among the group of outstanding students.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "STUDENTS are increasingly familiar with many Gener-ative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools and use them regularly. Some teachers tend to see it as a problem, because students have in their hands a tool that has the potential to create content that often they wouldn't do. Those teachers take for granted that their students will use it to cheat. The goal of experiments like the one presented in this article is to change this mindset and try to naturally apply the use of GenAI tools to enhance the learning experience.\nA remarkable quantity of sources, from renowned Uni-versities to international institutions, are providing a set of recommendations for teachers and students to get along with this embracement process. Chronologically ordered, some of the most relevants are [1], and a whitepaper [2], taken as foundational for many of the following works. Followed by [2] or [3], applied by [4] and [5] in Spanish ecosystem, or [6]. Most especially, the UNESCO recommendations guide [7], a new EDUCAUSE guide more oriented to GenAI [8], the work from [9] or Russell Group recommendations [10]. A recent compilation of studies in which ChatGPT and other GenAIs appear as new approaches for different educational purposes is shown in [11].\nThe next two subsections offer a summary of recommen-dations to use GenAI tools. The third subsection presents the related work that explore the usage of GenAI in computer science education, and more specifically, in database admin-istration education. The last subsection introduces the present work and the posed Research Questions."}, {"title": "A. Recommendations for students", "content": "Students use GenAI tools: in spring 2023, 27% of students were using Al writing tools, and by the fall, that percentage had jumped to 49%, despite some applied restrictions [12]. It is important to understand these tools, know how far they can go and integrate them into teaching and research effectively, responsibly, and ethically. That said, the most important rec-ommendations for students can be listed as follows:\n\u2022 Know and respect the regulations.\n\u2022 Focus on learning objectives: GenAI is a tool, not an end.\n\u2022 Use the GenAI: now is the time to learn how to use a GenAI tool correctly. For example: as a writing assistant, as a programming assistant, or as a teacher by running a conversation in Socratic mode. But being aware of the inherent risks in using GenAIs such as uploading personal information. Anyhow, the biggest risk is to use the answer that the GenAI returns at the first iteration, instead of offering a personal sieve and appealing to student critical spirit.\nFinally, whenever a GenAI had been used to perform a work, the recommendation is to declare it, like any other bibliography. Clues: which prompts have been used, and how the answers have been further processed."}, {"title": "B. Recommendations for teachers", "content": "As teachers put the GenAI to work at their service, using it with the due precautions, their teaching can be much more effective, reducing the time spent on a multitude of tedious tasks in order to focus on the important ones. All the recommendations split their application into the purely teaching and evaluation areas."}, {"title": "C. The Database Administration teaching with GenAIs", "content": "GenAI is a tool that outbreaks as a disruptive influence on data management. [13] points out that it will impact in two ways for this area. First, several hard database problems such as entity resolution, schema matching, data discovery, and query synthesis, can be approached in a new way as the semantics of the data are out of the scope of automation. Thus, Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid to transform database tuples, schemes, and queries in real-world concepts. Second, these tools so prone to answer questions suppose a real connection with predictive models and information retrieval.\nExploring the use of AI in teaching for acquiring Database Administration (DBA) skills is not new. Twenty years ago [14] reported, for instance, a case in which the students were impelled to create a proprietary search engine using two available tools in a semester course. After all these years we can find works like [15], which discusses the design process used in a graduate-level U.S. University advanced data analytics course including AI, focusing a part of its study on understanding AI impact on the accounting profession. They applied AI software (MindBridge) to analyze accounting data to evaluate risk, obtaining a 159% increase in the mindset mean from no knowledge at the beginning of the course to average awareness at the end, which is a strong evidence of student learning close to learning objectives. Moreover, they show a remarkable improvement on critical thinking.\nFocusing on the use of GenAI in software engineering, [16] provides a literature review in which up to 78 research questions were identified, showing the use of GenAI in a wide range of software development activities from design to education, but reckoning a lack of research to explore the steps to do. The collected experiences are related to the use of chatbots to assist the study, as well as the automatization of assessment to provide the students with immediate feedback.\nThere is an increasing number of papers discussing the possible use of GenAI in software engineering, although tests with students are still taking off. One important conclusion is that ChatGPT may enhance student programming self-efficacy and motivation, and the teachers must teach how to properly use it through prompt writing skills [17]. The results of [18] in a survey of 430 computer science Master Sc students suggest that many of them are familiar with ChatGPT but do not regularly use it for academic purposes, being skeptical of its positive impacts on learning unless guidelines and education on the tool is provided.\nA teacher's survey contextualized in nine courses at Univ. South-Eastern Norway can be seen in [19]. Three categories were explored: theory courses, programming courses (includ-ing DBA), and project-based courses. It was demonstrated that while GenAI tools can provide guidance on programming concepts up to an extent, students cannot fully develop their practical skills by using ChatGPT, especially those related to complex programming concepts or intricated problems like integrating libraries, specific system configurations, or large software systems. As some of the solutions provided by ChatGPT are outdated, it becomes clear that teacher assistant is highly desirable in combination with ChatGPT usage.\nScarce and shy trials including GenAI tools in higher education DBA courses have appeared. University of Virginia has published a series of courses in which they include some examples of using AI in the classroom when it comes to learn statistics and Data Science [20]. Despite it is a wonderful material, no results about their application are shared yet. There are some studies focused on how to teach SQL with ChatGPT. [21] at UNIR, a Spanish University, shows the use of a chatbot-based learning platform (based on IBM Watson) to iteratively assist students to perform SQL queries. Their results show that students who used the chatbot performed better on the final SQL exam (43% pass) than those who did not (18%). Interestingly, lecturers get illuminating metrics on student performance at the same time. [22], in a work in progress, are using ChatGPT for a similar purpose, but they have not yet reported concrete results."}, {"title": "D. Introducing this work", "content": "In the light of the above previous results and attempts, we have conducted an exploratory and correlational study. This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as conceptual framework [23]. This model has been largely used in the last decades to analyze the acceptance of technologies [24] and serves to explore how the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use affects to the actual use of a technology (see Figure 1)."}, {"title": "II.

Regarding the attendance, 22 students (60%) declared that they attended to all the practical classes, 12 declared that they attended to most of the classes (32%), and 3 declared that they only attended some of the classes (8%). All the students declared that had a free ChatGPT account (i.e., version 3.5) that they could use during the learning experience."}, {"title": "C. Procedure and materials", "content": "Once the theoretical part of the course was taught, students started the practical computer assignment in groups of three people. The students mainly used MySQL as database manage-ment system, and they operated it through console and MySQL Workbench. Secondarily, they also use MariaDB as database management system and operated it with phpMyAdmin.\nIn the assignment, students mainly faced the following tasks: 1) configuration and creation of a MySQL database; 2) realization of an Extraction-Transformation-Load process from several MS Excel files; 3) optimization of queries using indexes; 4) creation of users and provision of permissions; 5) backup and recovery operations; 6) configuration and creation of a MariaDB database; 7) migration from MySQL to Mari-aDB database. The students performed the assignment in eight 2-hours practical lessons, also working autonomously out of class. To complete the assignment, the students submitted a group report in which the procedures employed to solve the above-mentioned tasks must be explained.\nThe students were free to use any resource they consider to complete the practical assignment: notes and tutorials provided by the teacher, explanations of the teacher or colleagues, googling, traditional websites (e.g., stackoverflow, mysql offi-cial website, etc.), and GenAI systems (specifically, ChatGPT v.3.5). The students were encouraged to use all possible resources, and in the practical sessions the teacher exemplified the utilization of these resources solving some problems with their use.\nOnce the assignment was completed and the report was submitted, the students took the individual exam in a 1 hour and a half session. The exam compromised tasks similar to those outlined in the previously numbered list as 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. To perform the individual exam the students were free to use any resource they consider, except for messaging applications that would allow them to communicate synchronously with other people. This included the assignment report, tutorials provided by the teacher, googling, traditional websites, and ChatGPT v.3.5.\nFinally, once the students completed the assignment and took the individual exam, they fulfilled a questionnaire about the usage and the utility of the employed resources. The questionnaire was delivered online through the virtual learning environment of the course. Before submitting the question-naire, students gave their informed consent to use the collected information for research purposes."}, {"title": "D. Methods and instruments", "content": "The first data gathered in this case study are the student's grade in the practical part of the course, which is the grade of the individual exam. This grade is scored from 0 to 10, and gives rise to the following scales: 0-4.9 (fail), 5-6.9 (pass), 7-10 (outstanding). The second data are the results of the questionnaire administered to collect students' opinions about the utilized resources during the assignment and the exam realization.\nThe questionnaire comprises three sections. The first section included questions about age, gender, and classroom atten-dance. The second section included statements about the usage and utility of some resources available for the students during the assignment, as well as a question about the purpose for which they used ChatGPT (if used). The third section was like the second one, but addressed the resources employed during the completion of the individual exam. In the statements about the usage and utility of the available resources the students should indicate a level using a Likert scale from one (nothing) to five (a lot). In the statements about the utility of these resources the students could also select the option 'don't know/no answer', provided when they did not use a certain resource. The questionnaire items are presented together with the results."}, {"title": "E. Data analysis", "content": "The results of the student's grades and the questionnaire were analyzed by using two descriptive statistics: the mean (M) and the standard deviation (SD). Moreover, inferential results were computed. To do so, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality was conducted to check the normality of the data, which resulted to be not normally distributed. Therefore, non-parametric statistical methods were used.\nFirst, the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to compare and find out possible statistically significant differences on the usage and utility of the available resources among the students according to their grades. Moreover, the Eta Squared coefficient was employed to study the effect size of these differences. Regarding this coefficient, it must be considered that a value between 0.01 and 0.06 means a small effect size, a value between 0.06 and 0.14 means a medium effect size, and a value greater than 0.14 means a large effect size.\nSecond, the Spearman correlation test was employed to correlate the student's grades with the student's responses to the questionnaire items. Regarding the Spearman correlation coefficient (Rho), a positive value means a positive correlation and a negative value means a negative correlation. Moreover, a value lower than $|0.1|$ means there is no correlation, between 0.1 and 0.3 means a low correlation, $|0.3|-|0.5|$ a medium correlation, $|0.5|-|0.7|$ a high correlation, and greater than 0.7| means a very high correlation."}, {"title": "III.

Relation between the student's grades and the usage and utility of resources", "content": "Correlations using the Spearman technique were computed in order to know how the student's grades were related with the usage and perceived utility of the available resources during the assignment and the exam realization, as well as with the usage of ChatGPT."}, {"title": "IV. DISCUSSION", "content": "In the light of the presented results, it can be said that GenAI are not so much extended among CS students to learn DBA if we compare it with other learning resources such as personal reports, ad-hoc tutorials made by the teacher, explanations of teachers and colleagues, or traditional websites (e.g., google, stackoverflow, etc.). Indeed, GenAI was the least used resource for both the assignment realization and the individual exam The resources most used by the students to perform the practical assignment and the exam were, respectively, the assignment materials (i.\u0435., tutorials provided by the teacher) and the assignment group report (i.e., student's resolution of the proposed tasks).\nHowever, despite this, the usage of ChatGPT was mod-erately rated. Specifically, it was rated with a 3.03 (out of 5) and a 2.14 during the assignment and exam realization, respectively. Moreover, 75% of the students used ChatGPT at some time to perform the practical assignment and 45% used it to perform the individual exam.\nAs the TAM model [23], [24] indicates, the use of a technology is influenced by its perceived ease of use and its perceived usefulness (which will be discussed in the next question). The ease of use of ChatGPT depends on having certain prompting skills, which the professor trained through the practice sessions by providing several examples to solve practical DBA problems using ChatGPT.\nThe use of ChatGPT was not uniform among the students and it is relevant to observe the usage of this tool among students categorized on the basis of their grades. During the realization of the practical assignment , a certain difference can be observed between the use made of ChatGPT by students who succeeded the exam (3.33 out of 5) and those who did not (2.63). Moreover, the proportion of students using ChatGPT was somewhat higher in the case of students who obtained a grade of outstanding Moreover, by examining the proportion of students using ChatGPT among the different groups of students (see Figure 4), it can be observed that 75% of the students in the outstanding group used ChatGPT, whereas the students of the fail and pass group used it much less (25% and 11.1%, respectively). These data suggest that the students who obtained lower grades did not achieve sufficient proficiency in ChatGPT for DBA problem solving during the assignment realization (which may be due to lack of DBA knowledge, lack of prompting skills, or both), so most of them decided not to use this tool during the exam.\nTherefore, it can be concluded that although by now ChatGPT is not being used by CS students to learn DBA as much as other traditional learning resources, it is being moderately used. This conclusion is fully consistent with the work Nevertheless, the usage of ChatGPT is not uniform and it is especially pronounced among students who obtain higher grades, which may indicate that: a) a proper use of ChatGPT help students to get better grades, b) high-performing students know how to make better use of ChatGPT, c) a combination of both, which sounds more reasonably.\nRegarding the usefulness of ChatGPT for learning about DBA as perceived by the students, the students did not perceive ChatGPT to be as helpful as the other learning resources as well. In fact, during the assignment realization , this tool was perceived as less useful than the explanations of the teacher or colleagues, the tutorials provided by the teacher or traditional internet resources, while during the exam realization , ChatGPT was perceived as less useful than the assignment report or traditional internet resources.\nHowever, leaving aside the comparison of ChatGPT with other learning resources, the degree of usefulness of this tool is getting moderately high. In fact, the students rated with a score of 3.69 (out of 5) and 3.00 the degree of usefulness of ChatGPT for the realization of the assignment and the exam respectively. The students mainly used ChatGPT to learn the syntax and examples of SQL statements, to find a solution to a problem with a SQL statement, and to look for alternatives or improvements to certain SQL statements.\nTherefore, two main conclusions can be drawn from this discussion. First, in general terms ChatGPT is perceived by CS students as a moderately useful resource for learning about DBA, although not as useful as other traditional learning resources. This reinforces the results of the recent studies  showing that CS students demand further support from the teachers, rather than relying absolutely on the ChatGPT usage. It is also correlated with the [18] study in which the students declared that the ChatGPT usage could not be the only source to rely on. Nevertheless, our study shows an increase respect to these related works in the GenAI usage, as it is expected due to the increase of its knowledge and its widespread overall use. Second, students who obtain higher grades have a significantly different perception regarding the ChatGPT utility than students with lower scores and they perceive ChatGPT as a very useful tool, even more that other conventional resources.\nAnalyzing Tables V to VIII, it can be said that there is a relation between the usage and perceived utility of ChatGPT and the student's academic performance. To further explore this relation, the results correlating the students grades and the usage and perceived utility of ChatGPT will be taken into consideration.\n Therefore, it can be concluded that ChatGPT is a helpful tool to assist in the resolution of DBA problems and seems to positively impact on student performance. This is partially consistent with the work of [21], in which improvements in academic performance were connected with the usage of GenAI. However, that work showed that lowest rated students improved their performance with the use of a chatbot, contrary to our conclusions. It could be a consequence of using a specific chatbot deployed for the subject, while ChatGPT is a general GenAI that seems to be more useful for higher skilled students. Nevertheless, the chicken or the egg causality dilemma arises here: are high-performing students better in a subject because they use ChatGPT? or do high-performing students know how to use ChatGPT better because they have a stronger knowledge of the subject? Interestingly, [21] declared that high-performing students suggested implementation of more complex items for their chatbot, which points toward the second direction. Here we can see how a new digital trench could be rising between students with higher skills and knowledge who can improve their results, compared with the ones with lower degree of fundamentals, who may not take advantage of all the ChatGPT possibilities.\nConsequently, in order to reduce this trench and allow all students to get the most of GenAI, and in line with [17], we deem that it is necessary to promote a higher-order critical thinking by prompting, and teaching how to prompt in a higher dimension is a must to be covered in the near future by teachers. It will provide the students with two different tools: improving their insight view of the subject, as well as enhancing their ability to extract information using GenAI as a powerful tool that they are going to use from now on in their professional environments."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This paper has presented an empirical study with CS stu-dents about the usage of ChatGPT to learn DBA. The main findings are as follows:\n1) ChatGPT was moderately used, but not as much as other traditional learning resources. Likewise, ChatGPT was perceived as moderately useful, although not as much as other resources.\n2) Students who obtained higher grades used ChatGPT the most and found it to be a very useful resource, even more than some traditional learning resources.\n3) Positive correlations were found between the student's grade and the use and perceived usefulness of Chat-GPT. Other learning resources correlated positively with student performance were: teacher's explanations and tutorials, and student's reports and notes.\nThese findings allow us to conclude that ChatGPT is a helpful educational tool for solving DBA problems that are strongly connected with high student performance. To do so, students should be trained on the usage of this tool and practice to master it. Nevertheless, ChatGPT should be combined with other traditional resources to learn DBA, being especially im-portant the teacher's resources and explanations, as well as the reports or notes made by the own student during the practical part of the course. This is aligned with some recent studies, where the necessity of teacher's assistance is recognized by the students. At the same time, other recent educational research works in this area show also that the best ranked students are also the ones who use ChatGPT more in their learning. These precedents are reinforced by our work. We deem that these conclusions, although strongly connected to CS education, are fully transferable to any engineering or science discipline in which the practical mastery of technologies and problem solving play a key role.\nFinally, despite the positive outcomes, we recognized that this contribution is not free of limitations. First, the empirical study is not experimental, so no cause-and-effect relationships can be found. Therefore, it cannot be fully assured that using ChatGPT always leads to high academic performance neither that students who performed better do so exclusively thanks to ChatGPT. This limitation could be overcome by conducting an experimental study such as a randomized controlled trial where the ChatGPT usage was isolated, but this would entail many difficulties and it does not seem fair from a teaching perspective to allow ChatGPT usage only to certain students. Second, the sample size is quite small (i.e., 37), which un-dermines the generalization of the conclusions. Undoubtedly, more case studies like the one presented here (and, if possible, involving a larger sample) should be carried out in order to consolidate the conclusions. Moreover, the limited sample size prevents us to perform an analysis from a gender perspective, which could be also interesting."}, {"title": "VI. BIOGRAPHY SECTION", "content": ""}]}

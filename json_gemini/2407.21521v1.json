AI avatars, being disclosed as being an AI, or embodying specific genders, could be used in user-AI in-teractions. Leveraging insights from AI and avatar research, we explore how AI disclosure and gender affect user motivation. We conducted a game-based experiment involving over 72,500 participants who solved search problems alone or with an AI companion. Different groups ex-perienced varying AI appearances and disclosures. We measured play intensity. Results revealed that the presence of another avatar led to less intense play compared to solo play. Disclosure of the avatar as AI heightened effort intensity compared to non-disclosed AI companions. Additionally, a masculine AI appearance reduced effort intensity.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "With the rise of digital worlds [29,30,34,36], humans are increasingly interacting with different forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital spaces, for example, in the form of the recommended system in social media, chatbots or avatars. Similar to the offline world, the perceived gender of the entity that we are in-teracting with shapes our behaviour and motivation [2,13,28]. Past research on motivation in offline settings argues that gender differences in motivation arise from the social and cultural expectations, experiences and roles that are asso-ciated with being male or female [14]. Gender roles and stereotypes can shape an individual's beliefs, values and behaviours, including their motivation [14]. These predispositional features are almost immutable.\nHowever, contrary to the offline world, the gender of the agent that we are interacting with, i.e. the AI agent, is customizable. The AI gender appearances could be chosen on a scale, allowing us to experiment with immutable character-istics and observe their impact on user behaviour. Building on social exchange theory [18,31] and trust and agency literature [28] we argue that users playing together with an avatar exhibit a higher degree of persistence in comparison with playing alone. Further, we argue that users are more motivated to play with an agent if they attribute more agency to or perceive the gender of the agent to be"}, {"title": "Background", "content": "Motivation is defined as \"the degree and type of effort that an individual ex-hibits in a behavioural situation\" [17]. There are two types of effort: intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation [19]. Intrinsic motivation occurs when an individual finds something interesting or enjoyable, while extrinsic motivation occurs when an individual is motivated by the outcome of a task. While intrinsic motivation is more about the process, extrinsic motivation is more about the outcome. Past research shows that different demographics show categorically different motivational patterns or the demographics of others might influence their motivation. According to a literature review [21], motivation drivers vary among age groups."}, {"title": "Social interactions with AI", "content": "Interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly common. Considering that users can give agency to the AI agent, the characteristics of the AI can influence how people interact [11,33] and trust AI based on their ability to think, plan and act [28]. Past research shows that even the features of how the AI agent is described to users can influence the interaction and the user [15]. Within the interaction itself, the form factor (i.e. written, voice, physical) of the AI changes how participants conform to the AI [20]. In these interactions, the perceived gender of the AI influences the compliance with the AI [12, 13]. \u03a4\u03bf sum, past research shows that various factors influence how people interact with"}, {"title": "AI and Avatars", "content": "an AI. Increasingly, virtual worlds are where many of these interactions with AI could take place.\nVirtual spaces are expanding beyond gaming communities to offer courses, stores, and financial services, allowing consumers to discuss their interactions with firms, and for many more aspects of everyday life to take place online [30,35]. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, measured by factors such as escapism, vi-sual attractiveness, perceived usefulness, and entertainment value, impact users' attitudes towards using virtual worlds [30].\nIn virtual worlds, users are typically represented by avatars, which are graph-ical representations of themselves [9]. Users can design their avatars to represent their actual appearance or their desired identity in the virtual world [4]. The appearance of an avatar can influence the behaviour and motivation of the user, especially when the user can identify with their avatar [3,5,32]. The appear-ance of an avatar can also influence how a user is perceived by others in virtual worlds [4, 22, 27]. Particularly, avatar gender can also influence how a user is perceived and behaves in virtual worlds [29].\nUsers, similar to the offline world, can interact with others, represented by some avatar, in a virtual world. Past research suggests that cooperating with other players motivates players to use a virtual world: When an educational video game app added a feature where users could asynchronously cooperate, the app usage increased 217% [7]. Synchronous cooperation also motivates players: players of video games are motivated to play an exergame again more when they play together (in cooperation) with another player in the same physical space than when they played alone [16]. When the AI behaves like a player, or when the player cannot distinguish an AI agent from a human player, there should be no difference between the interaction with a player and with an AI, thus the effects of cooperating with another human could carry over to cooperating with an AI. Therefore, we suggest the following:\nH1: Participants who play with an AI avatar (treatment group, regardless of disclosure) have a higher intensity of playing than those who play alone (control group)."}, {"title": "Relationship between AI avatar gender and motivation", "content": "The gender of others who someone interacts with influences motivation [6]. Some research claims that men are motivated by competition and they believe they outperform others [6, 24], so men will want to keep ahead of others and are motivated to do so quickly. Other research claims that women behave more prosocially [23], so women might want to support others and continue to keep interacting longer, which will make them play longer.\nSince an AI is perceived to be a social actor by humans [11], the characteris-tics of the AI determine how humans interact with the AI [11] and the perceived gender of an AI having an influence on people's motivation during textual inter-actions [13], the gender effects may carry on when interacting with an AI. We therefore suggest the following:"}, {"title": "Relationship between AI disclosure and motivation", "content": "When interacting with an AI, the user could know whether the one they are interacting with is an AI or not (which implies it is a human). This AI dis-closure affects how users perceive an AI system [10, 25]. Employees who get performance feedback created by an AI get a negative perception of this feed-back when they know the feedback is created by an AI, which makes them less motivated by the feedback [25]. Additionally, Job candidates are less interested in an offer when their application is reviewed by an AI system and therefore are less motivated [10]. Note that the framing that is used when introducing the AI may have an influence on trust and conformance [15]). This lets us believe that AI disclosure causes a lower motivation of users, and therefore we suggest the following:\nH3: Intensity of playing is negatively associated with participants knowing that they are playing with an AI avatar, in comparison to playing without the AI being disclosed."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "In this section, we will discuss the methodology of the experiment we performed.

Roblox is an online gaming platform that allows users to create, share and play their own virtual experiences. This platform has over 150 million monthly active users. The game had more than 50.000 active daily users at the time of the experiment. The idea behind the game is simple: players get placed in a level (a room), and their task is to find a hidden object inside that room. Once they find the object they click on it, and they progress to the next level.\nThe player base of the game is very diverse. Players come from around the world, with different age groups, languages and devices. This makes it a good fit to research the impact of an avatar's gender on motivation in a very diverse player base."}, {"title": "Participants", "content": "Participants are players of the Game X.

One-third of the participants are in the control group and will participate alone. The other two-thirds are in the subject group and will participate in an AI avatar. Within the subject group, one-half was told they were playing with an AI (so one-third of all participants), while the other half (also one-third) was not told they were playing with an AI.\nAfter the explanation, participants select their avatar. Participants were com-pletely free to select the avatar they wanted; the question asked was 'Select your avatar'. The avatars differ in gender appearance. The avatars were always dis-played in the same order, from left to right (See Figure ??). Participants play with their selected avatar during the experiment, and participants are asked to rate this avatar on a 5-point scale ranging from 'very feminine' to 'very mascu-line'.\nAfter they select the avatar, they play the 'Science Mode', which consists of 15 stages. In this mode, players cannot see other participants, except the AI"}, {"title": "Measures", "content": "We proxy motivation based on how intensely players engage with the experiment and how likely it is that they complete all the stages. We measure the seconds spent per level by calculating the time before leaving the experiment divided by the number of levels completed. A lower value of seconds spent per level therefore implies that the participant spends less time on a level on average, and therefore engages more intensely with the experiment. The motivation of the participants is measured by using a performance-based behavioural measure. Performance-based behavioural measures indicate both a higher outcome-focused motivation (extrinsic motivation) and process-focused motivation (intrinsic motivation) [26].\nIn addition, we use a dummy variable to indicate if a participant has com-pleted all 15 stages. The time before ending the participation is also measured participation can end by either completing the 15 stages or leaving earlier.\nThe speed at which players complete the experiment therefore indicates if the avatar's appearance influences either the intrinsic process-focused motivation or extrinsic outcome-focused motivation.\nTo get a more reliable measure for the gender of the avatars, we asked each participant to rate their avatar on a 5-point scale, with 1 being 'very feminine' and 5 being 'very masculine'. This gives an average score for each avatar between 1 and 5. To simplify the analysis, we calculated the average rating score of the avatar. Given that the average of our 1-5 scale is 3, we mapped the avatar to either feminine when the average score is below 3 or masculine when the average"}, {"title": "Analytical strategy", "content": "To test the hypotheses, we used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) from the statsmod-els package [1] in Python.

If the sole goal would be to maxi-mize player intensity, it would be best to use a masculine avatar for the AI and to tell users that they are interacting with an AI, in order to motivate users in their virtual world. However, the results of this study also show the need for diversity in virtual worlds. We have seen that the similarity between the participants' avatar gender appearance and the AI avatar gender appearance moderates the effects of the AI avatar gender appearance on motivation. Therefore, preset gen-ders of both the own avatar gender and the AI avatar gender can limit the effect of the AI avatar on motivation. Diversity in both avatars, such as being able to choose the avatars from a diverse list or being able to freely create the avatars, could help the user in motivation within the virtual world. Beyond gender, en-sure that the avatars communicate attributes players are looking for, especially if you want to promote gender diversity in AI collaborators, whilst still stimulat-ing motivation. This requires more research to investigate what other attributes might affect the motivation of players, as well as a broader coverage of the gender continuum, for instance by introducing more androgynous characters."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "Our AI avatar movement was simple. The avatar moved to preset points and did not interact with participants in another way, such as talking or following them.

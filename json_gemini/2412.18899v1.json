INTRODUCTION", "content": "Generative agents, including LLM agents, can engage in reflections for decision-making or analysis by breaking down complex tasks and conducting systematic reasoning. LLM-based Multi-agent System (LLM-MAS) extends this capability by adding collective reasoning functions, with applications already emerging in fields such as software development and social simulations ([1-8]). One particularly noteworthy area is the application of LLM-MAS to scientific discussions. In some studies, generative agents have been used to address tasks including mathematical problems and medical debates, with interesting findings such as agents cor- recting their mistakes through dialogue ([9, 10]). Applying these capabilities of generative agents to discussions based on technical documents, such as patents, could potentially replicate the collective interactions that human teams engage in during the innovation process.\nEfforts to analyze the innovation process have histori- cally included observational experiments in actual corporate environments, but these have faced significant limitations due to low reproducibility and difficulties in manipulating experimental conditions. As a result, the effects of variables such as organizational structure, communication methods, and degree of diversity on the innovation process remain not fully understood. If LLM-MAS can replicate the innovation process, it would enable repeated simulations with adjustable conditions under high reproducibility.\nFurthermore, it is conceivable that artificial intelligence technologies, including LLMs, will increasingly be applied in real-world corporate innovation settings, creating a new domain of practice that could be described as \"AI-driven innovation.\" If LLM-MAS can simulate the innovation pro- cess, it would also be possible to pioneer this new domain by integrating human teams with generative agent teams, demonstrating new possibilities for AI-human collaboration in driving innovation.\nThe objective of this study is to examine whether col- lective reasoning among generative agents can facilitate novel and coherent thinking that leads to innovation. To achieve this, the study specifically focuses on analogy- driven innovation and proposes GAI, a new LLM-empowered framework designed for reflection and interaction among multiple generative agents to replicate this process.\nThe core of the GAI framework lies in an architecture that dynamically processes the internal states of agents and a dialogue scheme specifically designed to facilitate analogy- driven innovation. In the former, agents generate and refine ideas based on intrinsic motivation and critical introspection, leveraging previously reviewed documents and interactions with others to form their current thoughts, which serve as the basis for their contributions to the dialogue. In the latter, the scheme incorporates insights from management science and cognitive science to replicate the process of identifying functional similarities and mechanical differences, enabling the transfer of solutions across diverse technical domains.\nTo evaluate the functionality of the framework, this study uses Dyson's invention of the bladeless household fan as a case study. It examines the extent to which analogy-driven innovations can be replicated by the proposed framework using a set of fictional technical documents."}, {"title": "II. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "content": "The architecture of each agent consists of two primary modules driven by an LLM: a memory module and an internal state module (Figure 1). The memory module records the contents of reviewed technical documents, past conver- sations with others, and the agent's prior reflections, all timestamped for reference. These records are then organized into a structured memory, which is input into the internal"}, {"title": "A. Agent architecture", "content": "state module. The internal state module processes newly acquired technical information and statements from others during the dialogue, drawing on both recent thoughts and memories retrieved from the memory module. Based on this, the internal state module forms and updates the agent's current thoughts, which serve as the foundation for its future reflections and statements.\nWhen forming and updating current thoughts, the internal state module undergoes two processes: idea generation and introspection.\nDuring the idea generation process, the module generates multiple ideas for reflections on a technological domain based on the memories received from the memory module and the agent's thoughts at that time. Subsequently, the internal state module evaluates these ideas on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of three criteria-Novelty, Importance, and Consensus-using a language model and selects ideas that maximize an intrinsic reward calculated as a weighted sum of these criteria:\n$\\max r_{ij} = \\alpha_i \\text{Novelty}(x_{ij}) + \\beta_i \\text{Importance}(x_{ij}) + \\gamma_i \\text{Consensus}(x_{ij}),$ \nwhere $r_{ij}$ represents the intrinsic reward of agent i, $x_{ij}$ is its idea on object j, and $\\alpha_i$, $\\beta_i$, and $\\gamma_i$ respectively represent the weights for the 1-10 evaluation on each cri- terion, which are denoted by Novelty($x_{ij}$), Importance($x_{ij}$), and Consensus($x_{ij}$) in Equation (1). The Novelty criterion assesses the degree to which an idea introduces new content that has not been present in prior conversations and reflec- tions. The Importance criterion evaluates how significant the idea is in light of previous discussions and reflections. The Consensus criterion measures the extent to which the idea aligns with the opinions of the majority of participants, based on past conversations. By assigning different weights to these criteria for each agent, the framework can represent diverse intrinsic motivations. For instance, an agent with a higher weight on Novelty will prioritize curiosity and innovation, whereas an agent with a higher weight on Consensus will emphasize collaboration and agreement.\nDuring the introspection process, the generated idea are critically examined to identify any technical ambiguities or contradictions using a language model. The internal state module then adjusts the idea to address these issues, refining it to improve clarity and coherence.\nThe internal state module not only reflects on the agent's own thoughts about technological domains but also evaluates the opinions expressed by other participants. Specifically, based on prior conversations and the agent's current thoughts, it identifies aspects of each participant's opinions that the agent agrees with or finds interesting, as well as those that the agent considers contradictory or lacking.\nAs a result, the agent's current thoughts are continuously updated, incorporating refined ideas and reflections on others. During the dialogue, the agent makes statements based on its current thoughts, shaped through these processes, as"}, {"title": "B. Dialogue scheme for Analogy-driven innovation", "content": "Innovation takes various forms, such as technology-driven innovation, market-driven innovation, open, or closed inno-vation. This paper focuses on Design by Analogy (DbA), an approach to innovation that has been extensively studied across disciplines, including management science and cog-nitive science ([11-26]). Many groundbreaking innovations, such as the application of racing car technologies to run- ning shoes and various forms of biomimicry, employ cross- domain analogies. DbA is a method that addresses problems in a target domain by extracting and transferring design solutions from other domains (source domains). The central focus of this approach lies in identifying similarities and differences. In particular, it is widely recognized that superior innovations abstract away from surface-level or attribute- based similarities, instead relying on functional and relational similarities for analogy ([11, 13\u201316, 27]).\nBuilding on these interdisciplinary insights, this study pro- poses a dialogue scheme that leverages collective reasoning among agents to replicate the process of DbA, extracting functional similarities and mechanical differences from tech- nical documents and transferring solutions across domains.\nSpecifically, this scheme facilitates the following stages in sequence:\nPreparation: Reviewing technical documents from different domains. Each agent is provided with multiple technical doc- uments belonging to the target domain and source domains and is tasked with reviewing them.\nPhase A: Extracting functional similarities. Through multi- ple rounds of discussion, the agents identify functional sim- ilarities between the target domain and the source domains. They also determine which of these similarities are more central to the problem at hand.\nPhase B: Extracting mechanical differences. Building on the functional similarities identified in Phase A, the agents examine the mechanisms that generate these shared functions in the target and source domains. Through several rounds of discussion, they identify the differences in these mechanisms and evaluate which of these differences are most significant.\nPhase C: Transferring solutions. In this phase, the agents explore how the mechanical differences identified in Phase B can be applied to address the challenges in the target domain. Through multiple rounds of discussion, they determine what aspects of the source domains' mechanisms need to be modified and incorporated into the target domain, as well as what features of the target domain's existing functions or mechanisms should be retained or discarded."}, {"title": "C. Organizational Structure", "content": "The organizational structure of the agent team is defined as a directed graph, with agents as vertices and the directions of communications or instructions as edges. Each agent can only communicate with adjacent agents and issue instructions in the direction of the edges.

EXPERIMENT", "content": "In the experiment, we use Dyson's invention of the blade-less household fan, Dyson Air Multiplier, as an example of innovation and evaluate the extent to which the proposed framework can replicate the key elements of this invention's ideas. The evaluation is conducted in a sandbox environment using fictional technical documents."}, {"title": "A. Case: Dyson Air Multiplier", "content": "In household fans, it is common to cover the spinning blades with a grid-like guard to prevent accidental contact. However, such guards not only reduce the efficiency and consistency of airflow but also make the device less con-venient to carry and clean. Dyson Air Multiplier addressed these challenges in household fans by applying the principles of fluid dynamics used in jet engines to household fans and achieving a transition from a physical blade-based airflow mechanism to a fluid dynamics-based airflow mechanism utilizing pressure differential.\nThe Dyson Air Multiplier is often referred to as a \"blade-less fan,\" but this label is somewhat misleading ([28]). In reality, the device uses blades enclosed within the base, which are powered by an efficient brushless motor to draw in air. Atop the base, a ring-shaped airfoil with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is mounted. Air drawn into the device is expelled through the narrow slits of a jet nozzle on the inner surface of the ring. During this process, the fan pulls in air from behind the ring, effectively \"multiplying\" the airflow ([29]). Specifically, the air drawn from the base is accelerated through the jet nozzle, creating a pressure gradient that induces surrounding air to be pulled in (in-ducement). Additionally, the high-speed expelled air entrains the surrounding air, generating a consistent airflow directed forward from the ring (entrainment).\nDyson introduced the first generation of the Dyson Air Multiplier to the market in 2009. However, the first-generation device faced challenges with noise levels. To address this issue, Dyson invested over $60 million in further research and development, culminating in the release of the second generation in 2014. The second-generation model"}, {"title": "B. Experimental Method", "content": "In the experiment, dialogues among generative agents are conducted with household fans as the target domain and industrial ejectors as the source domain. An ejector is an industrial device used for transporting fluids (liquids or gases). It is utilized not only for water supply, exhaust, and smoke extraction but also for neutralization, dilution, and cooling through the mixing of gases or liquids, as well as for creating vacuum conditions as a vacuum pump.\nAlthough the application domains are entirely different, household fans and industrial ejectors share a functional sim- ilarity in the movement of fluids. However, the mechanisms that enable this function are entirely distinct. In a typical ejector, a nozzle draws high-speed driving fluid into the body as the driving source. As the high-speed driving fluid reduces the pressure inside the body, creating negative pressure, the surrounding low-speed external fluid is pulled into the body. The mixed fluid of the driving and external fluids is then discharged outside the body through a diffuser. This allows the ejector to move external fluid without requiring any external power source.\nIn the practical stage of the proposed framework, actual technical documents, such as patent filings, are expected to be used. However, in the sandbox environment presented in this paper, fictional technical documents based on real- world technical information are prepared. These fictional documents, like actual patent documents, include miscella- neous information that does not necessarily lead to the target invention. For instance, in the case of industrial ejectors, the document contains information about a wide range of industrial applications far removed from household use, de- tails about unrelated components, and data on various types of irrelevant fluids and materials. Similarly, the technical documents for household fans include various unrelated information. Agents must extract fragments of information that lead to a \"solution\" from this broad and miscellaneous data and connect those fragments using their independent reasoning. In this particular experiment, the agents must reinterpret the concept of driving fluid from the perspective of a household fan and devise a method to generate it within the constraints of household technology and energy envi-ronments. However, the agents are prohibited, by prompts, from using pre-trained knowledge about Dyson products or any information available on the internet. Instead, they are required to base their statements and reflections strictly on logical conclusions or associations derived from their prior discussions and reflections."}, {"title": "C.

Results", "content": "As shown in Table III, in all cases with 1, 3, and 5 agents, the models with internal states outperformed those without on average. This indicates that, through refinement by the internal state module, more coherent and comprehensive ideas are constructed and shared among agents. For example, comparing the two models with one agent, in the model without an internal state (Model A), the proposal of retaining blades or incorporating an appropriate blade-driven device as a mechanism to generate a driving fluid or negative pressure (Criteria 1 or 2) was made only 3 times out of 10. In contrast, in the model with an internal state (Model B), such mechanisms were proposed 9 times out of 10. This indicates, in the former model, the agent's reflection did not address how to deal with the external driving fluid required in incorporating ejector-like technology into household fan, whereas in the latter model, the concept of external driv-ing fluid was successfully reframed within the context of household fans as the intake of surrounding air by the fan blades. Furthermore, in the model without an internal state, aside from the introduction of nozzle structures, the proposal for optimizing internal channels to improve the efficiency and reduce the noise of the driving fluid (Criterion 8) was made only once out of 10 times. In contrast, in the model with an internal state, such proposals were made 7 times out of 10, ranging from the redesign of the fan housing to the introduction of guide vanes and the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Below is an example of part of an agent's statement in the single-agent model with an internal state (Model B).\nTo address challenges in household fans,\nwe could integrate concepts from ejector\nmechanisms while selectively retaining\nand discarding traditional fan elements.\nRather than relying solely on large\nrotating blades, we might consider\nsmaller impellers driven by the existing\nmotor, which would introduce directed\nair streams.\nRetaining a compact\nmotor system that uses lightweight,\nefficient turbines is crucial, as it\nallows for consistent airflow without\nexcessive bulk.\nBy strategically\ndesigning air inlets and channels,\nwe can naturally guide air currents,\neven without a high-velocity driving\nfluid. Prioritizing safety, all moving\nparts should be enclosed within the\ncasing, utilizing protective materials\nto eliminate the risk of contact with\nblades.\nUtilize computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) to refine blade\nshapes and angles, enhancing air\nmovement and improving efficiency.\nIncorporate guide vanes that naturally\ndirect airflow, minimizing reliance\non high-velocity inputs. This approach\nensures smoother air pressure control\nand efficient cooling without adding\nmechanical complexity.\nIn contrast, the interpretation of the impact of the number of agents is not straightforward. On one hand, the effect is generally positive for models without an internal state. First, the average performance improved significantly when the number of agents increased from one (Model A) to multiple (Models C and F). Second, when comparing the three-agent model (Model C) to the five-agent model (Model F), increasing the number of agents significantly reduced the variance, although the average scores remained unchanged. The larger variance in scores with three agents may partly stem from the stricter majority requirement for consensus, where the opinion of a single agent can heavily influence the results.\nOn the other hand, when the agents have an internal state,"}, {"title": "", "content": "the single agent model (Model B) outperformed almost all multiple-agent models both with and without an internal state (Models C, D, E, F, and G) except for Model H. It also recorded the smallest variance across all models. This highlights the strong capability of the internal state module in deriving comprehensive and coherent ideas, even when acting alone. However, its superior performance compared to some multi-agent models with internal states may also be attributed to the stricter majority requirement. In particular, the larger variance observed in the scores with three agents suggests this.\nThe highest average score among all models was recorded by the case with five heterogeneous agents with an internal state (Model H). Increasing the number of agents from 3 to 5 slightly relaxed the consensus requirement, allowing a broader range of opinions to emerge from more diverse agents, which were then refined and shared through collective reasoning. The positive effects of the number and diversity of agents are consistent with the results of some prior studies on LLM-MAAS ([1, 10]). Below is an example of part of agents' statement in the multiple-agent model with an internal state (Model H).\nAgent_1:\nFirst, retaining the\nelectric motor is crucial, but shifting\nthe focus from blades to a ducted design\nwith specialized nozzles could minimize\nsafety risks and maintenance.\nThis\nmeans adopting a circular or linear\nduct system to channel airflow, creating\nefficient fluid movement pathways. The\nkey is to enhance the fan's ability to\ndraw in and expel air smoothly using\ncontrolled high-speed airflow, perhaps\nwith adjustable nozzles or diffusers\nthat modify air velocity and direction.\nAgent_2:\nHowever, traditional metal\nor plastic grids could be phased out if\nthe airflow generation can be enclosed\nentirely within the fan's structure.\nAgent_3\nThe most critical adaptation\nwould be incorporating the ejector's\npressure-driven flow to create a\nbladeless fan. This could be achieved\nusing a small compressor or blower to\ngenerate a high-pressure air source,\nchanneling it through a nozzle to\nproduce a coherent airflow.\nAgent_5:\nRetaining the motor to\npower a compressor or blower generating\na directed airflow stream aligns with\nfluid dynamics principles, enhancing\nefficiency.\nAgent_1:\nNoise minimization can be\nachieved by including sound-dampening\nmaterials and CFD-aided design to manage\nhigh-speed airflow noise impacts.\nThe agents' dialogue above proposed several ideas, in-cluding eliminating the existing grid guard and conducting airflow generation within an enclosed environment inside the fan, adopting a ducted design to improve airflow efficiency, utilizing a motor-driven blower to generate high-speed driv-ing fluid, and performing CFD simulations to reduce noise. These proposals demonstrate that the key ideas underlying the Dyson Air Multiplier have been successfully replicated."}, {"title": "IV.

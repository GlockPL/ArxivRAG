Introduction", "content": "Biometric authentication techniques have become integral in ensuring secure access and identity verification in various domains. These techniques are typically classified into two classes-behavioral and physiological. Behavioral biometrics encompass characteristics based on an individual's behavior, such as signature, keystroke dynamics [1], gait analysis [2], voice recognition [3, 4], and more. On the other hand, physiological biometrics include physical and static characteristics, which are classified also into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic biometrics include features that are external to the body, such as fingerprint, palm print, face, and iris patterns. Intrinsic biometrics, on the other hand, involve features that are inherent to the body, such as vein patterns and retinal scans.\nFrom the hand, numerous physiological properties can be extracted for biometric purposes, as illustrated in Figure 1. Among these, hand veins-based biometric method has attracted widespread attention because of several distinct advantages. These biometrics are inherently more secure and difficult to forge, as they are internal to the body and not easily accessible. Finger vein (FV) biometrics, for instance, have been shown to exhibit a level of diversity similar to that of iris patterns, ensuring high security and suitability for biometric authentication [5]. Moreover, capturing vein patterns is only effective in a living body, making it impossible to steal vein patterns from deceased individuals [6, 7]. Additionally, vein patterns are permanent and do not change in adulthood [8]. Furthermore, vein images are typically captured by contactless sensors, ensuring hygiene and convenience [9]. Research has also shown that vein recognition is robust against various distortions such as motion blur, defocus, sensor aging, and compression [10]. Despite its advantages, hand vein-based biometrics face challenges. Factors like capture device configuration, ambient light, dust, humidity, and finger misplacement can affect performance [5, 11]. However, research has shown that these issues can be mitigated with optimized settings and processing strategies. Various methods have been developed to overcome those issues.\nSince the vein-based biometric system was investigated, many significant achievements have been made in this area as new systems have been continuously designed and deployed over the years. deep learning (DL) has emerged as powerful tools in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of vein-based biometric systems. DL significantly enhances hand vein recognition by automating feature extraction and improving accuracy. Traditional methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Wavelet Transform, often rely on manual feature extraction and are sensitive to variations in lighting and hand positioning. In contrast, DL models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can identify complex patterns and variations in vein structures with minimal human intervention, leading to higher recognition rates and robust performance."}, {"title": "1.1. Motivation and contribution", "content": "The motivation behind this comprehensive review stems from the increasing significance of DL in the field of vein biometrics. As the demand for robust and secure authentication methods grows, understanding the advancements in DL for FV, palm vein (PV), and dorsal hand vein (DHV) recognition becomes pivotal. This review aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in these areas, spanning the period from 2015 to 2024, highlighting key contributions, breakthroughs, and challenges encountered in the application of DL techniques. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no prior research paper that has explored and critically evaluated contributions in FV, PV and DHV using DL until now.\nIn recent years, a multitude of survey papers have been published, evaluating various facets of vein biometric models, as summarized in Table 1. Most of these reviews focus on specific hand vein types such as FV [5, 13\u201316], PV [17, 18] or DHV [19], while others include several physiological biometrics [20, 21]. Some of these reviews focus on specific topics such as presentation attack detection (PAD) in biometric systems [21], feature extraction [15], or the generation of synthetic vein images [18]. These reviews primarily cover traditional approaches, with partial inclusion of DL approaches or an exclusive focus on DL. Also, many of these reviews partially address or miss critical areas such as datasets and metrics reviews, challenges, and future directions.\nUnlike previous reviews, our work addresses all three hand vein types-FV, PV, and DHV-as well as multimodal vein recognition, focusing solely on DL approaches. Additionally, our review provides an extensive analysis of existing datasets and evaluation metrics. It also examines data augmentation and deep transfer learning (DTL) techniques, which are crucial for limited hand vein data. Finally, the review outlines current challenges in the field and future directions for research. The contribution of the manuscript is summarized as follows:\n\u2022 This paper reviews recent methods for hand vein-based biometrics using DL, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. It also covers PAD and template protection (TProt), primarily for FV recognition.\n\u2022 The review analyzes DTL and data augmentation techniques across all reviewed DL-based approaches. It also covers evaluation metrics and main datasets exploited in hand vein biometrics.\n\u2022 The review spans literature from 2017 to 2024, with insights presented through tables and figures to aid understanding DL-based hand vein SOTA methods.\n\u2022 The paper aims to motivate further research in vein-based biometrics by highlighting research gaps, challenges, and proposing future directions.\nThis research suggest paths for further investigation in hand vein biometrics, focusing on various technologies, methodologies, and datasets. By analyzing infrared images (IRIs), researchers can accurately identify vein patterns in fingers, hands, and palms. The subsequent section provides a concise overview of these contributions.

Background", "content": "According to the reviewed SOTA work, some background knowledge is necessary to deeply understand the proposed ML/DL-based hand vein identification approaches. For a comprehensive understanding of various ML and DL techniques, researchers are encouraged to consult our previous work in [22]. This publication covers a broad spectrum of methodologies, including deep belief network (DBN), graph neural networks (GNN), deep neural network (DNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, autoencoders (AEs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM), and CNN. These techniques are valid and adaptable across multiple fields of research. In contrast, the background section of this review is specifically focused on advanced DL techniques employed in hand vein recognition research. For instance, DTL, particularly fine-tuning and domain adaptation (DA), is widely adopted. Additionally, attention layers and Transformers, which are advanced versions of attention mechanisms, are also extensively used. By concentrating on these newer and more complex concepts, this review aims to equip readers with the necessary foundation to comprehend current trends and innovations in the field. While fundamental concepts like CNNs are crucial to many approaches, they are well-established in the literature and thus are not detailed in this section."}, {"title": "3.1. Deep transfer learning", "content": "DTL is a ML technique where a pre-trained model, which was initially trained on a large dataset for a specific task, is reused or fine-tuned for a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch, DTL leverages the patterns and knowledge learned by the pre-trained model to improve performance on the new task, often with less training data [23].\n(a) Fine-tuning all layers in a model: When researcher fine-tune all layers of a pre-trained model, he adjust the weights of the entire network on your new dataset (Figure 5 (a)). This approach is beneficial when the new task is similar but has some significant differences from the original task [3].\n(b) Fine-tuning some layers in a model: In this approach, the researcher only fine-tune certain layers of the pre-trained model while keeping others frozen, i.e. their weights remain unchanged (Figure 5 (b)). This is useful when the new task is very similar to the original task [3].\n(c) DA: Is a subfield of DTL where the goal is to adapt a model trained on a source domain to perform well on a target domain, despite the differences between the domains (Figure 5 (c)). This involves adjusting the model, by feature adaptation or fusion, to bridge the gap between the source and target domains, which may have different distributions or feature spaces [23].\nFor example, in the context of FV biometric recognition, fine-tuning all layers in a model might involve starting with a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet and then training it entirely on a FV dataset to capture the unique patterns of veins across different individuals. Fine-tuning some layers could involve freezing the initial layers of the same pre-trained CNN, which capture general features, and only training the later layers on the FV dataset to adapt to vein-specific details. For DA, a model pre-trained on a similar biometric dataset, such as PV images, could be adapted to FV images by using techniques like adversarial training to align the feature distributions between the two domains, ensuring robust performance despite the differences in image characteristics. Thus, DTL and DA can be extremely useful due to the limited availability of hand-vein image datasets."}, {"title": "3.2. Attention mechanism and Transformers", "content": "In recent years, the fields of DL and ML have been revolutionized by the concepts of Attention mechanisms and Transformers. These innovations have significantly improved the performance of models in tasks such as language translation, text generation, and image processing.\n(a) Attention mechanism: The attention mechanism is a concept that enables models to focus on specific parts of the input data when making predictions. It was introduced to address the limitations of traditional sequence models, such as RNNs and LSTMs, which often struggle with long-range dependencies and information retention over long sequences. Attention works by assigning different weights to different parts of the input sequence. This allows the model to prioritize important information and ignore irrelevant details. The key components of the attention mechanism include [4]:\n\u2022 Query (Q): Represents the current state or the part of the sequence that is being processed.\n\u2022 Key (K): Represents all parts of the input sequence.\n\u2022 Value (V): Also represents all parts of the input sequence, but these are the actual values being processed.\nThe attention score is calculated as a similarity measure between the query and the keys, and this score is used to weigh the values. This weighted sum then forms the attention output.\n(b) Transformer model: The Transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. in [24], is built entirely on attention mechanisms, eschewing the use of recurrence altogether. Transformers have become the foundation for SOTA models in NLP, such as bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT), generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT), among others [25]. Key components of the Transformer model include:\n\u2022 Multi-head self-Attention: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously by employing multiple attention mechanisms (heads). Each head captures different aspects of the input.\n\u2022 Positional encoding: Since transformers do not process sequences in a sequential manner, positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each word in the sequence.\n\u2022 Feed-forward neural Networks: Applied to the attention outputs, adding non-linearity and improving the model's expressive power.\n\u2022 Layer normalization and residual connections: Help in stabilizing and improving the training of deep models by normalizing the inputs and adding skip connections.\nTransformers consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a set of attention-based representations. The decoder takes these representations and generates the output sequence, often using a similar attention mechanism to focus on different parts of the input."}, {"title": "4. Fundamentals of hand vein biometrics", "content": "Hand vein biometrics utilize the vascular patterns present in various parts of the hand, including the fingers, palms, and the dorsal hand (Figure 6). The hand's vascular network consists of veins and arteries. Veins carry deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), while arteries transport oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) [18]. The hand's vascular structure displays intricate patterns that facilitate unobstructed blood flow during hand movements. These specific patterns enable the vascular network to serve as a biometric identifier, with superficial networks being primarily utilized due to the optical limitations of acquisition systems [26]. Each individual's vein pattern is unique, akin to fingerprints, due to the random development of vascular structures influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The following are the types and characteristics of hand veins:\n\u2022 FVs: The vascular network in the fingers is composed of several small veins running parallel to the bones and joints. These veins are typically arranged in a branching pattern that varies significantly from person to person. These patterns offer high resolution due to the smaller captured area, revealing rich details. However, the smaller area limits the amount of data captured compared to PVs.\n\u2022 PVs: The palm's vein structure includes a more complex and denser network of veins, owing to the larger surface area. The palm's veins are situated beneath the skin and muscle, providing a unique and stable pattern for each individual. Because the palm has no hair, it is easier to photograph its vascular pattern. The palm also has no significant variations in skin color compared with fingers or the dorsal hand, where the color can darken in certain areas. The larger surface area offers more data for recognition, but recognition accuracy might be affected by wrinkles or scars present on the palm.\n\u2022 DHVs: The veins on the back of the hand are more superficial and visible compared to those in the palm. They form distinctive patterns that can be easily captured with appropriate imaging techniques. They are more convenient for non-intrusive capture (easier to position the hand)."}, {"title": "4.2. Architecture of hand vein recognition system", "content": "A hand vein recognition system operates through a three-step process: acquisition, enrollment, and verification (or identification), as illustrated in Figure 7. During the enrollment phase, individual images are collected and undergo preprocessing to remove noise. Feature extraction algorithms then identify unique characteristics of the vein network. These features are compiled into a secure digital template specific to the user and stored in a database. In the identification phase, the user's image is captured, and the system repeats the preprocessing and feature extraction steps. The extracted features are then compared with the database templates to either determine the user's identity in identification mode or verify the user's identity in verification mode [28]."}, {"title": "4.2.1. Image acquisition", "content": "The acquisition of hand vein images is carried out usually using near-infrared (NIR) devices that interact with oxidized hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxidized hemoglobin (Hb) in the vascular network [17, 29]. When the light wavelength is between 720 nm and 760 nm, the radiation is strongly absorbed by Hb, producing a shadow corresponding to the vein pattern. At 790 nm, there is an intersection point where Hb and HbO2 present the same absorption, which allows the visualization of veins and arteries. Meanwhile, for higher spectral ranges of the optical window HbO2 presents a slight increase compared to Hb. Thus, the vascular pattern inside the hand can be rendered visible with the help of an NIR light source in combination with an NIR-sensitive image sensor. Several studies highlighted that wavelength range of 875nm-890nm is the best choice for hand vein recognition [30-32].\nIn NIR-based hand vein image acquisition (Figure 7 (a)), the device initially uses an light emitting diode (LED) array to emit NIR light onto the hand. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which is sensitive to NIR light, then captures the detailed hand vein image. Several acquisition modes can be found:\n\u2022 Based on NIR imaging technique, hand vein image acquisition can be categorized into transmission mode and reflection mode [33]. In transmission mode, NIR light passes through the hand, and an NIR-sensitive camera captures the light on the opposite side, creating a clear vein pattern due to the absorption properties of hemoglobin. In reflection mode, NIR light is emitted onto the hand's surface, and the reflected light is captured by an NIR-sensitive camera placed on the same side as the light source. This mode is more practical for various applications due to its ease of use and less restrictive positioning.\n\u2022 Based on contact with the capture device, the acquisition modes can be divided into two categories: touch-based acquisition [34, 35] and touchless-based acquisition [36]. In the first mode, the hand is in contact with the device, ensuring stable positioning and consistent imaging conditions. The second mode does not require physical contact, enhancing hygiene and user comfort. It is particularly suitable for public or high-traffic environments but may require more advanced image processing to handle variations in hand positioning.\n\u2022 Based on the illumination type, it can be divided into four categories: top-light illumination [37], side-light illumination [38], bottom-light illumination [39], and both-light (side and top) illumination [40]. In top-light illumination, NIR light is directed from above the hand, which highlights vein patterns with minimal interference from ambient light. In side-light illumination, NIR light is directed from the side, providing contrast that can enhance the visibility of veins through light reflection. In bottom-light illumination, NIR light is directed from below the hand, which can be effective in transmission mode setups. Both-light illumination combines side and top lighting, utilizing both reflection and transmission for comprehensive lighting and improved image quality.\n\u2022 Based on hand pose for dorsal hand imaging, the acquisition modes can be classified into two categories: open hand mode [41], where the hand is positioned open and flat, making it easier to capture the dorsal vein patterns, and clenched hand mode [42], where the hand is clenched, which might be used to highlight different aspects of the dorsal vein network.\nThese various acquisition modes can be selected based on the specific needs and constraints of the hand vein recognition system, optimizing for factors such as image quality, user convenience, and application environment."}, {"title": "4.2.2. Image preprocessing", "content": "Image preprocessing plays a crucial role in hand vein recognition systems by ensuring that captured images are suitable for feature extraction and of high quality. Various factors, such as ambient light, sensor cleanliness, humidity, temperature, illumination, and user behavior, can affect the acquisition of hand vein images. Neglecting these factors can lead to low-quality images and decreased recognition accuracy. To address these issues, preprocessing involves several steps to improve vein pattern visibility and eliminate artifacts or noise that might hinder recognition. These steps include image quality assessment, image restoration and enhancement, and region of interest (ROI) extraction.\n\u2022 Image quality assessment: Image quality assessment is a crucial initial step in the preprocessing of hand vein images. This process involves evaluating the overall quality of the captured images to determine if they meet the required standards for further processing. Factors such as focus, contrast, brightness, and overall clarity are assessed to ensure that the vein patterns are clearly visible and suitable for feature extraction. Images that do not meet the desired quality criteria may be discarded or undergo further enhancement to improve their suitability for subsequent processing steps.\nBased on the human visual system's sensitivity and prior knowledge, numerous handcrafted descriptor-based methods have been developed for image quality assessment [43-45]. However, these handcrafted descriptor-based methods face several challenges. Firstly, some features directly derived from human visual system characteristics and prior knowledge may not adequately represent the quality of hand vein images. Secondly, single-feature methods are insufficient for comprehensive evaluation, while multi-feature methods are complex and time-consuming [5]. Integrating DL into image quality processes can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of hand vein recognition systems. Unlike traditional handcrafted descriptor-based methods, DL models can automatically learn and extract relevant features from images without the need for explicit human knowledge or sensitivity to the visual system. DL models are capable of handling the complex and diverse characteristics of hand vein images, making them more effective at evaluating image quality. By utilizing large amounts of training data, DL models can establish an accurate mapping between image features and quality, enabling them to effectively assess the quality of new images. Several approaches have been developed, primarily focusing on FV recognition. An overview of these DL-based approaches is presented in section 6.1.1."}, {"title": "4.2.3. Feature extraction", "content": "After preprocessing, Feature extraction is a crucial step in hand vein recognition systems, as it involves identifying and quantifying the unique patterns in vein images that can be used for accurate identification and authentication. This process translates the raw, preprocessed images into a set of numerical features that represent the essential characteristics of the vein patterns, facilitating the subsequent matching and classification stages. Traditional methods for feature extraction from vein images often rely on handcrafted techniques that utilize domain-specific knowledge. While traditional methods have been successful to some extent, they often require careful tuning and may not generalize well across different imaging conditions and populations. Handcrafted features are sensitive to noise and do not perform well on low-quality images. Additionally, setting standard parameters for these methods can be challenging, requiring extensive experimentation to determine suitable parameters for different databases. The choice of matching strategy after feature extraction can also significantly affect recognition performance [5].\nDL methods have revolutionized feature extraction in recent years, offering a more automated and robust approach compared to traditional methods. DL can learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw images without the need for handcrafted descriptors. These methods can simultaneously extract features, reduce data dimensionality, and classify within a single network structure. Compared to traditional methods, a significant advantage of DL is its ability to maintain good and stable recognition performance regardless of image quality and hand/finger placement. DL methods also reduce the need for extensive parameter tuning and can handle the complex and varied characteristics of hand vein images more effectively. Most proposed DL approaches in hand vein recognition focus on feature extraction tasks, as reviewed in section 6."}, {"title": "4.2.4. Matching", "content": "After feature extraction, the final stage involves comparing the acquired vein image to a stored template. This comparison generates a matching score that indicates how similar the two images are. A high score suggests the input image belongs to the enrolled individual, while a low score implies a potential imposter. Two main methods are used in this phase: distance-based and classification-based [5, 51]. The distance-based method directly compares the extracted feature vectors using a distance metric. The smaller the distance, the more similar the images are. On the other hand, the classification-based method utilizes ML algorithms to classify the input image as either a match or a non-match based on the extracted features.\nIn the context of DL approaches, classification methods often integrate feature extraction and classification into a single model. This integration allows the model to learn the most relevant features for matching during the training process, leading to more accurate and efficient recognition performance."}, {"title": "5.

Overview of hand vein biometric datasets", "content": "Vein biometric datasets are essential for the development, testing, and evaluation of hand vein recognition systems. These datasets provide the necessary data to train and validate algorithms, ensuring they perform accurately and reliably under various conditions. In this section, the paper review the most commonly used datasets in DL-based approaches, focusing on FV, PV, and DHV images, as summarized in Table 3. These datasets are developed by the research community and are generally collected using self-designed and low-cost devices and different collection protocols. Consequently, they encompass a range of image parameters, including illumination, contrast, and performance results. Most of these datasets are publicly available on the internet or can be obtained by requesting them from the principal investigator.\nFor FV, THUMVFV-3V and MultiView-FV are two are two datasets specifically designed for multi-view recognition problems, offering data from various angles to enhance recognition accuracy in rotation and translation in practical applications. Additionally, the SCUT-SFVD, ISPR, and VERA finger vein datasets are utilized for PAD. These datasets include fake images created by printing real FV images, making them valuable for developing and testing anti-spoofing techniques.\nDL models developed for hand vein recognition face significant challenges related to the small number of samples, which limits the training data for vein recognition tasks and, consequently, reduces the generalization performance of the models, and hinder their effectiveness. To address these challenges, researchers have explored two main solutions: (i) the use of pre-trained models, which leverage knowledge from large, diverse datasets, improving performance even with limited hand vein data, and (ii) the application of data augmentation techniques, which artificially increase the dataset size by creating variations of the existing data, enhancing the model's ability to generalize. Given the importance of these techniques in DL, this paper systematically analyzed their usage across all the reviewed articles in our study, as indicated in the Tables 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11.\nAdditionally, some researchers have adopted the generation of synthetic databases, such as S-PVDB and NS-PVDB for PV recognition [52, 53]. Synthetic images can be highly effective for evaluating the performance of image processing algorithms. However, their use in biometric applications remains controversial. Synthetic databases have the advantage of avoiding the time-consuming process of real data collection and can facilitate the validation of proposed approaches on large-scale databases. Despite these benefits, synthetic datasets cannot entirely replace validation with real images. Therefore, while they help in large-scale testing, real-world data remains crucial for final validation and ensuring the robustness and reliability of hand vein recognition systems. The research conducted by Salazar-Jurado et al.

Preprocessing-based methods", "content": "In the preprocessing step, DL models have been developed to automatically assess the quality of FV images, enabling the selection of the most reliable samples for feature extraction. Furthermore, image enhancement and restoration techniques based on DL have been proposed to improve the clarity and contrast of FV images, enhancing the overall recognition accuracy. Tables 5 and 6 summarize proposed schemes identified by their objective fields, including preprocessing techniques for image quality assessment, enhancement and restoration.\n1) Image quality assessment: Qin and El-Yacoubi [81, 82] were the first to apply DL for FV quality assessment. They proposed training a CNN on binary images to predict vein quality, aiming to minimize verification errors. Low and high-quality images are automatically labeled, assuming low-quality images are false rejected FV images. Experimental outcomes show the proposed method's efficacy in achieving high performance in a public database. Zeng et al. [83] utilized a light-CNN approach for assessing image quality, specifically to determine if it contains well-defined and consistent vein patterns. They segmented the image into multiple blocks and calculated average results from these block images to assess overall quality. This light-CNN architecture reduces computation time while also extracting strong features to represent the quality of FV images. In [84], a CNN-based method for evaluating FV image quality was introduced to improve recognition performance and reduce false rejection of low-quality images. The method uses statistical analysis to compare different finger samples, automatically determining and classifying image quality. A lightweight CNN is then used to train images classified as high or low quality based on the evaluation criteria. By identifying common attributes among low-quality images, the system can efficiently assess image quality in practical settings. Experimental results demonstrate the method's excellent performance on three public datasets, showing its effectiveness in enhancing the original recognition system's performance.\n2) Image restoration and enhancement: Guo et al. [85] proposed an image restoration approach to enhance the integrity of venous networks. The method involves an adaptive threshold method to detect the unknown incomplete regions in FV images. Subsequently, a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network model is employed to restore the FV images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in improving vein network integrity in FV images. CAE was also used for FV image enhancement [86], where a residual CAE architecture is trained in a supervised manner to enhance vein patterns in near-IRIs. The method has been evaluated on several databases, showing promising results on the UTFVP database as a main outcome. In [87], authors proposed a method using a modified conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to restore optically blurred FV images. The GAN includes a generator with an encoder and decoder, along with a discriminator. The restored images were then used for FV recognition using a deep CNN, leading to improved recognition performance. Similarly, a GAN-based restoration model was proposed in [88] to recover missed patterns in FV images. The results show that the proposed method restores missed vein patterns and reduces the EER of the FV verification system. Jiang et al. [89] proposed a finger vein restoration algorithm based on neighbor binary Wasserstein GAN (NB-WGAN). The method uses texture loss as part of the loss function of the generator to recover more vein texture details. In recent work [90], GANs were used to restore FV images by addressing multiple degradation factors like non-uniform illumination and noise. The approach classified the degradation factor using a task adaptor and adaptively restored the image based on this factor through task channel-wise attention. Gated fusion was employed to merge features from four points in the generator, simultaneously considering feature characteristics from low to high levels. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach enables automatic decision-making by considering the environment's state, the desired actions, and the rewards obtained, is used with GAN for FV image restoration [91]. This model trains an agent to select restoration behaviors based on the image state, enabling continuous restoration. The tasks are divided into deblurring, defect restoration, and denoising/enhancement. For deblurring, a FV deblurring GAN based on DeblurGAN-v2 with an Inception-ResNet-v2 backbone is used. For defect restoration, a FV feature-guided restoration network is proposed with two stages: feature image restoration and original image restoration. Experimental results show reduced EER for single and multiple image restoration problems."}, {"title": "6.1.2. Features extraction-based methods"}]}

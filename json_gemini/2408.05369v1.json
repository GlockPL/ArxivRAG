The proposed eye-tracking system is based on machine learning algorithms, a standard webcam, and two personal computers that constitute, respectively, the \"Measurement Sub-System\" performing the test on the patients and the \"Test Management Sub-System\" used by medical staff for configuring the test protocol, recording the patient data, monitoring the test and storing the test results. The system also integrates an stress estimator based on the measurement of heart rate variability obtained with photoplethysmography.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Eye-trackers are devices designed to measure the direction of the gaze (where one is looking) and/or both eye movements related to the head. Nowadays, they are widely used in many fields, ranging from neuroscience, marketing, product design and human-machine interaction [1].\nThere are several methods for measuring eye move- ments, including search coils [2] and electrooculograms [3], but currently, the most popular eye-trackers use video images from which the eye position is extracted [4], [5].\nSome cognitive impairments, such as Alzheimer's Dis- ease (AD), are linked with eye movement-related disor- ders, while others indirectly relate to the gaze dynam- ics [6]. Several investigations have been conducted in the last few years aimed at applying eye-tracking technology to the detection of AD.\nThe main objective of medical research on AD is to diagnostic the disease as soon as possible to maximize the effectiveness of therapies [7]. It is even possible to identify this disorder before symptoms appear by detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Patients with symptoms of MCI have a very high risk of developing AD, with a conversion rate of 6% to 25% per year [8]. Although many patients with MCI tend to become stable after some time, more than half of them regress into dementia within five years, which outlines MCI as an excellent alarm bell that anticipates AD development.\nEven if MCI does not markedly impair the daily ac- tivities of a person, some symptoms consist in difficulties in carrying out complex operations that previously took place without problems (such as preparing a meal) [9]. It is therefore extremely important to identify symptoms of MCI from its the early stages. Diagnostic biomark- ers able to identify the pathology associated with this disorder include the detection of altered levels of tau and amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid, the use of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to identify disease- specific patterns of regional atrophy and MRI Tlp to detect disease-related macro-molecular protein aggrega- tion, and the direct imaging of amyloid deposits using positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerized tomography [10].\nAs it is not possible to foreseen a wide diffusion of all those diagnostic tests to the entire adult population, given their high costs and degree of invasiveness, eye- tracking-based tests are very promising in order to obtain reliable, low-cost and non-invasive biomarkers for the early detection of MCI [11]. In fact, there are at least two types of tests based on eye-tracking that allow us to obtain bio- markers for MCI:\nSaccadic Eye Movements (SEM) analysis\nSaccades are rapid eye movements of the eye followed by fixations, that is, the time in which the look is still to send information to the brain and proceed to the next saccade. These movements are necessary and customarily used to perform actions such as reading. Patients with AD presents irregularities of the saccadesand show difficulties reading the texts. These disorders are already present in a very early stage of ADand in MCI before AD regression [12], [13].\nVisual Paired Comparison (VPC)\nThis type of test [7] relies on memory impairment caused by MCI. The VPC tests may consist into two distinct phases: the familiarization phase and the test phase. Both test steps display pairs of images for a assigned time on a screen, using the eye-tracker to monitor the observer's fixations. As an example, the pictures are presented in pairs with identical stimulus during the familiarization phase, while during the"}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "Our approach to the eye-tracking design is based on the usage of video images from a webcam from which the gaze point on the screen is estimated [4], [5].\nThe necessary steps for gaze point measurement are the detection the position of the observer's face inside the images acquired by the webcam and then the position of the eyes into them and the estimation of the observed point on the screen.\nThe software was developed using the Python lan- guage [18]under the Linux operating system. It is based on two classifiers exploiting the Viola-Jones object de- tection framework [19], [20], the former used to detect the position of the observer's face and the latter used to detect the position of the eyes and on a dense neural network used for calibration [21]. The Viola-Jones object detection framework is a robust and real-time algorithm primarily motivated by the problem of face detection that is composed by four stages:\nHaar Feature Selection, using Haar basis func- tions [22];\nCreating an Integral Image [23], [24];\nAdaboost Training [25];\nCascading Classifiers.\nThe Haar feature-based cascade classifiers [19], [20] are provided by a function of the OpenCV library that is a large open-source library for computer vision that we use also for images and webcam frames manipulation and for the implementation of the graphical user interfaces [26]."}, {"title": "B. Calibration procedure and assesment", "content": "Before the actual test it is necessary to carry out for each observer a calibration procedure where the geomet- ric characteristics of the observer's eyes are (implicitly) estimated as the basis for a fully-customized and accurate gaze point prediction.\nDuring calibration, a blank screen is presented to the observer with a circle that moves following a predefined pattern. The observer is requested to keep his face still, with eyes opened and visible, the face frontal and centered with respect to the camera and to pursuit the circle with the eyes; moreover, only a single face must appear in the frame. If one of these conditions are not met, the program gives an alarm and goes into stand-by, waiting for the observer to position himself correctly again.\nThe eye images and the effective positions of the stimuli on the screen are collected in a data set that is used for training a dense neural network [29] aimed at creating a (in general non-linear) map that will allow to estimate the positions of the gaze points on the screen during the test.\nThe architecture of the dense neural network comprises an input layer of 1024 neurons acting on the sub-image 32x32 containing the eye, two hidden layers of 500 and 100 ReLU units and an output layer composed by one sigmoidal neuron giving the estimate horizontal position of the observed point on the screen. As the training is aimed at interpolation, we bring the optimization procedure into over-fitting (using a large number of epochs) and then obtain a precise localization of the observed point on the screen.\nTo quantitatively measure the accuracy of the neural network, a test procedure has been developed in which the observer is required to click on points that appear one-by- one in random positions on the right or left side of the screen. Based on the answers given by the observer, the program gives an evaluation of the accuracy on the right / left side discrimination. \nThe test of accuracy on 100 points (50 on the left and 50 on the right of the screen) shows an average absolute"}, {"title": "C. Heart Rate Variability Monitoring", "content": "It's worth noting that it is possible to exploit the proposed architecture to add additional functionalities useful for monitoring the mental state of the patient during the MCI test, such as facial expression detection [30], and stress monitoring through the measurement of heart rate [31] or heart beats per minute (BPM).\nIn our system, a region of interest (ROI) \u03a9FROI located in the forehead is selected to estimate the heart rate [31]. This is done by measuring in the sRGB color space the variation of the average optical intensity in the region in the e green channel that contains the most pulse"}, {"title": "D. Single-Board Computer Version", "content": "Using a single-board computer, such as the Raspberry PI4 [34] for implementing the \"Measurement Sub-System\u201d, we encountered significant limitations in the process- ing speed. To overcome these limitations, we included in our software the possibility that the \"Measurement Sub-System\" locally records the frames from the camera while the observer watches the pairs of images. When the test is over, the \"Measurement Sub-System\" transfers the complete data gathered by the camera to the \"Test Management Sub-System\", which calculates and save in a database all the predictions on each frame and the corresponding heart rate."}, {"title": "E.

EXAMPLE OF TEST PROTOCOL", "content": "In collaboration with the physicians of the Neurological Clinic of the University of Genoa, we are defining the details of a protocol for the implementation of a test for the early diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment based"}, {"title": "IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "In this paper we have presented a system for eye- tracking aimed at carrying out tests based on a Visual Paired Comparison protocol for the early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment. The proposed system uses webcams, standard personal computers that may already be available at hospital structures (or even low cost-single board computers) and exploits some efficient machine learning algorithms.\nEven if the proposed system is not the first affordable eye-tracker that uses artificial intelligence algorithm, stan- dard webcams and personal computers it is characterized by its specialization and validation for tests based on Visual Paired Comparison protocol and for its integration with stress measurement based on heart rate variability. Given the low-cost of the proposed eye- tracking system, once the measurement protocol has been defined and its clinical trials concluded, a wide diffusion of the test is expected, with great positive repercussions on public health, given that the Alzheimer's disease is one of the chronic diseases that affects a large segment of the elderly population and is spreading more and more also in low-income countries, with the rise in life expectancy."}]}

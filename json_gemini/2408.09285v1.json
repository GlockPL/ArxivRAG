Our study compares the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots with pre-defined scripted chatbots, evaluating key criteria such as usability, user engagement, and learning outcomes. The results show that LLM-based chatbots significantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and immersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve cultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes.

These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR in cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable practices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In recent years, integrating digital technologies in education has transformed learning paradigms, making them more immersive, interactive, and personalized [22]. Virtual Reality (VR), in particular, has demonstrated its capacity to create highly immersive environments that simulate real-life experiences or historical events [66]. Similarly, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of human-like responses, providing interactive learning experiences. However, combining VR and LLMs to preserve cultural heritage remains unexplored. Specifically, enhancing cultural learning by immersing learners in virtual environments enriched with intelligent interactions presents a unique opportunity [9]. This paper aims to evaluate user perception and the educational impact of integrating these technologies in virtual environments for cultural learning. This area requires further research and presents a promising direction for future studies."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "We provide an overview of the previous work in two directions, which are discussed in the following subsections."}, {"title": "2.1 Preserving Cultural Heritage in Digital Humanities", "content": "Cultural spaces have increasingly adopted digital technologies such as digital storytelling [30,37,48], serious games [2,45], and interactive displays [27,51] to engage users. VR, in particular, has shown promise in Digital Humanities (DH) for enhancing cultural heritage experiences by enriching user interactions and improving educational outcomes [6, 32, 38, 40]. However, these implementations often focus on individual tools rather than the holistic integration of technologies.\nOur study explores this space by merging VR and LLMs to improve cultural heritage accessibility and interactivity. By leveraging LLM chatbots and web-based VR environments, we aim to enhance dynamic user engagement beyond that provided by traditional conversational chatbots [60] and audio guides [20]. This approach seeks to document, preserve, and disseminate cultural heritage while evaluating system usability, engagement, and learning outcomes, thereby contributing to the preservation of cultural heritage in the DH field."}, {"title": "2.2 The Potentials of Emerging Technologies on New Learning Paradigms", "content": "Towards Human-like Conversational Chatbots for Cultural Heritage\nLLM-based chatbots have significantly improved the delivery of historical content in museums by leveraging NLP and ML for enhanced visitor interactions [18, 60]. However, these technological solutions often face scalability challenges beyond the confines of physical institutions, which restricts their broader applicability on global cultural heritage education. [7, 15, 18]. Despite interactive and personalized recommendations [8,10], challenges in achieving deep conversational contexts persist [10, 14, 18].\nRecent advancements in Human-Centered LLM, particularly through explainable LLM (XLLM) [42] and GPT-4 [43], promise new horizons for cultural heritage accessibility [47]. XLLM strategies deepen user engagement through interactive storytelling and participatory narratives [58]. ChatGPT, for instance, offers comprehensive and contextually relevant interactions [36,65].\nOur research integrates an LLM-based chatbot within a VR environment to scale cultural heritage experiences beyond museum spaces. This approach leverages LLM's advanced conversational abilities to provide more meaningful and accessible cultural heritage interactions."}, {"title": "VR for Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Preservation", "content": "VR has revolutionized how historical and cultural content is experienced, enhancing visitor immersion and engagement [17,59]. However, VR's potential for ICH preservation remains underexplored, even though ICH is more vulnerable to loss [25, 46, 49]. VR can revive historical events and present ICH practices to a broader audience, overcoming geographical barriers [28].\nICH, transmitted through oral traditions and social practices, poses documentation challenges [25, 63]. VR's ability to create interactive spaces offers a novel approach to fostering community participation and understanding of ICH [13, 16, 39]. It facilitates embodiment learning, allowing users to actively participate in cultural practices through simulation [3, 28, 54, 67].\nHowever, VR's application in ICH preservation faces challenges such as potential loss of context, emotional depth [33] and scalability issues [28]. Our work introduces an interactive system that leverages web-based VR integrated with LLMs to address these limitations, making ICH more accessible and adaptable to evolving technologies. This approach seeks to preserve the richness of cultural heritage and enhance engagement beyond traditional museum settings."}, {"title": "3 Methods", "content": "This study aimed to enhance user experience within cultural heritage applications by integrating VR and LLMs. We developed the \"Scottish Bonspiel VR\" game, incorporating an LLM-based chatbot as a cultural ambassador to illustrate how traditional Scottish curling was played. This exploratory research compared the performance of ChatGPT with a predefined chatbot commonly used in digital cultural heritage settings. The predefined chatbot, featuring scripted responses within Scottish cultural heritage contexts, served as a baseline for comparison. Without further fine-tuning of ChatGPT and the prescripted chatbot, this setup allowed for a direct comparison with the dynamic capabilities of the LLM-based chatbot, highlighting potential improvements in usability, engagement, and learning outcomes. Through this approach, we aimed to advance the application of chatbot technology in cultural heritage settings.\nThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Technical University of Munich approved our study, ensuring adherence to ethical research standards. Our research aims to answer the following research questions:\nRQ1: How does the LLM chatbot in a Scottish Bonspiel VR experience improve usability compared to a predefined chatbot?\nRQ2: How does the LLM chatbot in a Scottish Bonspiel VR experience enhance user engagement compared to a predefined chatbot?\nRQ3: How does the LLM chatbot in a Scottish Bonspiel VR experience improve cultural heritage learning outcomes relative to a predefined chatbot?\nWe employed a between-subjects design to evaluate the user experiences of two different chatbot technologies within the \"Scottish Bonspiel VR\" game.

The results show significant enhancements in usability with the LLM-assisted VR experience, confirming our RQ1 and demonstrating LLM's adaptive and conversational strengths [35, 50,56,64]. LLMs effectively handle diverse inquiries, foster creative thinking, and manage user expectations, surpassing the limitations of traditional predefined chatbots [21].\nWhile results show that LLM chatbots generally receive high accuracy ratings, these should be interpreted with caution due to the risk of LLMs generating misleading responses [4]. This phenomenon aligns with previous research on LLMs, which suggests that a human-like conversational tone may enhance clarity but does not necessarily improve accuracy [12,31].\nAligned with previous research, LLMs can streamline technical development and facilitate scalable deployment across digital platforms [5]. However, feedback from open-ended questions revealed technical issues such as \u201cSometimes voice not recognized correctly\u201d and \u201cExperienced internet connection problems\u201d. These challenges highlight the dependency of LLM effectiveness on robust internet service, which may be lacking at some cultural heritage sites.\nOur study affirms the role of emerging technologies like LLM in enhancing the usability of VR applications for cultural heritage, advocating their use in both preserving and educating about ICH, thus enriching the cultural heritage experience."}, {"title": "5.2 Designing Future Cultural Heritage Applications: Leveraging LLM and VR to Engage Younger Audiences", "content": "Our analysis reveals that users engage more frequently and for longer durations with the Scottish Bonspiel VR experience when assisted by LLMs rather than predefined chatbots. This finding, addressing RQ2, highlights the effectiveness of integrating LLMs' dynamic conversational capabilities with VR's immersive visual and auditory modalities, significantly enriching the user experience.\nWe developed a prototype offering multimodal interaction in VR, enabling users to converse with a chatbot using their voice. We found that combining VR with LLMs enables a more interactive way to disseminate ICH knowledge and engage younger audiences. Situating this research within the framework of \"Experimental Preservation\" offers an alternative approach to safeguarding cultural knowledge, recognizing culture as a living, evolving phenomenon rather than a static object. Unlike the one-sided narration often found in cultural heritage representations [57], our approach demonstrates that leveraging LLMs in VR empowers users to actively participate in constructing the narrative. This involves engaging in conversations about the history and development of Scottish curling against the backdrop of climate change."}, {"title": "5.3 LLM and VR as New Learning Paradigms for Cultural Heritage Education", "content": "From the results, no significant differences were found in learning outcomes between CGPT and PD chatbots, this is likely due to the small sample size and limited evaluation tools.

Results from the NASA TLX show that participants engaging with ChatGPT experienced higher cognitive load, though these differences were not statistically significant, suggesting that ChatGPT's detailed responses may increase cognitive demands in a VR setting, which warrants further investigation. For learning styles, word cloud analysis revealed distinct interaction patterns between participants and ChatGPT. Activists frequently used the term 'know' in their queries, indicating a quest for specific information, while 'game' and 'play' were common among reflectors, theorists, and pragmatists, indicating a more experiential approach. These observations suggest the potential for personalized VR learning experiences tailored to diverse learner preferences."}, {"title": "6 Limitations and Future Work", "content": "This section outlines the limitations of our study and suggests future research directions to enhance the sustainability, interdisciplinary collaborations, and technology integration of cultural heritage applications.\nFurther research is necessary to evaluate the real-world impact of VR and LLM technologies on cultural heritage preservation, particularly considering the novelty bias associated with emerging technologies.  Investigating how digital interventions can inspire community participation in heritage preservation aligns with UNESCO's Article 15 [53], which emphasizes the role of communities, groups, and individuals in safeguarding ICH. Longitudinal studies are crucial to determine if the proposed system not only attracts initial interest due to its innovative nature but also effectively motivates individuals to engage in activities that promote cultural heritage awareness, such as attending workshops or advocating for ICH preservation on social media, over the long term.\nCollaborating with cultural heritage experts, technologists, and educators is vital for enhancing LLM-delivered content's authenticity and educational quality.  Future VR designs should integrate chatbot interactions more deeply into the gaming narrative.  This approach aims to blend entertainment with learning, enhancing user engagement and achieving more profound educational impacts.\nBy addressing these areas, future research can build on the insights offered by this study, fostering more sustainable, engaging, and educationally rich cultural heritage applications leveraging emerging technologies."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating VR and LLMs technologies in enhancing the preservation and understanding of intangible cultural heritage through the \"Scottish Bonspiel VR\".

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Internet of Things (IoT), a well-known term, refers to a vast network connecting the billions of physical devices (e.g., smartphones, vehicles, and robots) embedded with sensors and actuators throughout the world via the Internet, which enables these devices to communicate with each other [1]-[3]. A range of technologies (e.g., sensor networks, wireless communica-tion, and cloud computing.) are harnessed to achieve real-time data communication and information exchange, effectively bridging the realms of the digital and physical world. IoT has influenced various domains, including cities, industries, transportation, healthcare, and so on. According to Cisco's projections 1, the number of IoT devices will be up to 500 billion globally by 2030. With the increasing number of devices connecting to IoT, it is likely to play a pivotal role in enhancing the intelligence of our world by providing a variety of intelligent services.\nIn recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelli-gence technologies and the growing computation capabilities of IoT devices have accelerated the rapid growth of the IoT. This, in turn, has given rise to the promising emergence of a new frontier: Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) [4]-[6]. Unlike traditional IoT, AIoT aims to establish a comprehensive and intelligent connection between Humans, Machines, and IoT devices by combining advanced artificial intelligence techniques and IoT techniques, to improve the quality and efficiency of service management with minimal human intervention. Especially, IoT excels in establishing extensive connectivity for millions of physical devices to collect multi-source data, while AI techniques are harnessed to analyze and extract valuable knowledge from massive data for sophisticated data processing and intelligent decision-making. Consequently, the deep fusion of AI and IoT will bring various potentials in ubiquitous sensing, collaborative computing, dis-tributed learning, and effective decision-making, to enhance more intelligent services for a wide range of applications, including smart cities, intelligent manufacturing, etc.\nGenerally, AIoT primarily consists of three components to enable real-time data processing and efficient information extraction. Embedded computing module deploys various IoT devices (e.g., robots, wearable devices, and smart vehicles) to collect sensing data and perform tasks.

EMBRACING CROWD KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER IN AIOT", "content": "In this section, we first describe the basic concept of traditional transfer learning. Next, we introduce an overview of the AIoT framework, which consists of the embedded comput-ing layer, edge computing layer, and cloud computing layer. Furthermore, we present the definition of CrowdTransfer, a new concept of knowledge transfer, to empower AIoT agents with the capability of self-learning, self-adaptation, and con-tinuous evolution across a diverse range of AIoT applications. In addition, we delve into the intricacies of CrowdTransfer and provide insights to explore how crowd knowledge is transferred among AIoT agents in different scenarios through four fundamental modes: derivation, sharing, evolution, and fusion modes. Finally, we present the general framework of CrowdTransfer for AIoT field to illustrate its key modules and transfer techniques. For brevity, we provide a table of notations used in our work in Table I.\nA. Preliminary of Transfer Learning\nRecently, with the rapid growth of data size and computa-tional resources, machine learning has achieved great success in many areas. However, it has limited ability in some real-world applications where there is insufficient data to train the model. In addition, the model trained in one domain can only be directly utilized for another domain with the same data distribution, because many machine learning methods assume that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution, which may not hold in practical scenarios. Knowledge transfer or transfer learning, which aims to transfer knowledge across domains or tasks, is an effective way to solve the above-mentioned problems without much expensive data-labeling efforts.\nTransfer learning [11]\u2013[13] is an important research prob-lem in machine learning. The objective of transfer learning is leveraging knowledge learned from one task or domain to improve the performance of a related, but different, task or domain. This section introduces some basic definitions of transfer learning.\nDefinition 1 (Domain): A domain $\\mathcal{D}_o$ is composed of two components: a feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ and a marginal probabil-ity distribution $P(X)$, where $X$ is the particular instance set in the feature space of all possible instances, $X = \\{X_1,X_2,..., X_n\\} \\in \\mathcal{X}$. Thus, the domain $\\mathcal{D}_o$ can be denoted as $\\mathcal{D}_o = \\{\\mathcal{X}, P(X)\\}$.\nDefinition 2 (Task): A task $\\mathcal{T}_a$ consists of two components: a label space $\\mathcal{Y}$ and an objective decision function $f$, that is, $\\mathcal{T}_a = \\{\\mathcal{Y}, f(.)\\}$. The decision function $f$ is an implicit one,"}, {"title": "III. KEY TECHNIQUES OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER", "content": "In recent years, transfer learning methods have experienced substantial advancements and have led to the emergence of various learning paradigms. This article embraces a compre-hensive understanding of transfer learning, encompassing the sharing of diverse forms of knowledge, e.g., network parame-ters, typical instances, features, or network structures, between source and target domains/tasks within the scope of this paper. In this section, the key techniques for facilitating knowledge transfer comprise domain adaptation/generalization, multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and meta learning (as shown in Table III).\nA. Domain Adaptation\nDomain adaptation (DA) aims to build a model that can learn knowledge from semantically related source domains with different distributions to perform the tasks in the tar-get domain [20]. In AIoT scenarios, agents frequently en-counter tasks with identical conditional probability distribu-tions (CPDs) but differing marginal probability distributions (MPDs). For instance, a target model deployed in an intelligent surveillance camera exhibits proficient performance under sunny weather conditions, yet experiences a sudden decline in performance during snowy weather conditions. This issue can be resolved through DA, wherein the model is adapted to transition from sunny to snowy weather conditions. The entire process of adaptation necessitates aligning the distribution of data from the source domain with that of the target domain, encompassing the alignment of CPDs, MPDs, or both.\nGiven the feature space of the source domain, $\\mathcal{X}_s$, the feature space of the target domain, $\\mathcal{X}_T$, the label space of the source domain, $\\mathcal{Y}_s$, the label space of the target domain, $\\mathcal{Y}_T$, as well as the training sets of the source domain, $\\mathcal{D}_s = \\{(x_i, Y_i)\\}$, and the target domain, $\\mathcal{D}_T = \\{x_j\\}$, the objective of DA is to learn a mapping function $f: \\mathcal{X}_s \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}_s$. This mapping function aims to minimize the distribution discrep-ancy between the domains, $D_{KL}(P_S || P_T)$, and a combination with the loss function $L (f (x_i), Y_i)$:\n$\\min_f \\mathcal{A} D_{KL} (P_S || P_T) + \\sum_{(x_i,Y_i) \\in \\mathcal{D}_s} L (f (x_i), Y_i)  \\qquad(1)$\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}$ serves as a weighting parameter. At present, dom-inant methods employed to facilitate DA primarily com-prise instance-based adaptation, feature-based adaptation, and model-based adaptation.\n1) Instance-based DA: The instance-based DA aims to reduce the discrepancy between the source and target domains by re-weighting the source instances, which can be achieved through direct instance weighting or instance kernel mapping weighting. Direct instance weighting adjusts the weights of the source instances to align the weighted source data distribution with the target data distribution [41]. For example, Chen et al. [42] assign a weight vector to the source instances and subsequently re-weight those instances located in the vicinity of the target domain subspace for aligning the source and target domain sub-spaces. The aforementioned methods are implemented within the original data space, while researchers"}, {"title": "IV. CROWD TRANSFER LEARNING MODELS", "content": "Crowd knowledge transfer plays an increasingly prominent role in AIoT. Benefiting from the self-adaptive ability of crowd transfer learning models, they optimize their own modules according to the state of IoT devices and the changes in the environment to improve specific task performances. This section mainly analyzes the crowd transfer learning models in detail to manifest the mechanisms of knowledge usage manners behind various methods.\nDue to the sensing/perception ability of agents, a single modal or task data is not enough to successfully complete a specific task. In AIoT scenarios, there are multiple agents executing different yet related tasks, such as tasks with varying data distributions or different data modalities. Taking into account the interrelated tasks of multiple agents and leveraging shared factors or representations among these tasks is also an important approach to enhance the generalization of individual task learning and facilitate crowd knowledge transfer. This section primarily focuses on introducing the research paradigm of crowd transfer learning models, mainly including central-ized inter-agent knowledge transfer, decentralized inter-agent knowledge transfer, and intra-agent knowledge transfer. Table IV summarizes the CrowdTransfer Models.\nSpecifically, the centralized inter-agent knowledge transfer and decentralized inter-agent knowledge transfer summarize crowd knowledge transfer methods from the perspective of interactions among crowd agents. Constrained by the require-ments of privacy security, data acquisition ability, etc., it is often challenging for an agent to obtain sufficient data for a specific task, and models cannot be learned well due to limited training data. The target agents can not only achieve self-optimization by using the knowledge of their surrounding agents for reference, but also realize crowd evolution by sharing knowledge with each other.\nThe intra-agent knowledge transfer summarizes crowd knowledge transfer methods from the perspective of agent itself, i.e., attributes of agents (such as data scale, resource, and sensing ability). In AIoT scenarios, agents have different func-tions, various number/types of basic sensors, and chips with distinct capabilities, which makes each agent form different aspects and levels of knowledge in the process of interacting with contexts, e.g., experiences, policies, or skills.\nA. Centralized Inter-agent Knowledge Transfer\n1) Federated Transfer Learning: With the increasing de-mand for data privacy and the improvement of relevant laws and regulations [90], there are often various restrictions im-posed on the exchange of data between agents. Consider"}, {"title": "V. APPLICATIONS", "content": "In this section, we showcase various AIoT applications to demonstrate the effective utilization of CrowdTransfer methods in enhancing model performance within real-world scenarios, as shown in V.\nA. Human Activity Recognition\nHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to the task of inferring and predicting human intentions and activities using sensor readings. Recent advancements in HAR have led to numerous applications, including smart homes [228], health-care [229], and sleep state detection [230], among others. HAR plays a vital role in human life as it captures and analyzes people's behavior, enabling computing systems to monitor and assist individuals in their daily activities. Owing to the intricate relationship between sensor readings and ac-tivities, machine learning algorithms have gained popularity as a viable approach for activity recognition tasks. Given that the human body is commonly equipped with multiple sensors (e.g., smartwatches, mobile phones, etc.), researchers often incorporate the concept of knowledge transfer in HAR, contrasting with traditional single-source single-target transfer learning solutions, as discussed subsequently.\n1) Gesture recognition: Zhang et al. [191] address the issue of domain shift by employing a mixed-expert approach. They utilize multiple specialized perception models or the collective intelligence of experts to capture the mapping from various WiFi inputs to desired outputs. This approach expands WiFi sensing to new environments and increases the problem size, with applications in gait recognition and gesture recognition. Yang et al. [17] propose a cross-domain knowledge distillation method, namely MobileDA. In MobileDA, a teacher network trained on a server extracts knowledge for a student network operating on an edge device, all while maintaining the simplic-ity of the deep model. It aims to learn transferable features and is applied to WiFi gesture recognition tasks. Zhang et al. [192] investigate cross-domain knowledge transfer and introduce the Widar3.0 system, which applies cross-domain knowledge transfer to a WiFi-based gesture recognition system. Widar3.0 extracts domain-independent features of human gestures at lower signal levels, capturing their unique dynamics and making them applicable across domains. Based on this, a universal general-purpose model is developed with a single training, allowing it to adapt to different data domains and achieve zero-effort cross-domain recognition.\n2) Daily activity recognition: Wang et al. [193] explore the scenario in which the activity information is missing on the arm and investigate how to utilize information from other body parts (referred to as the source domain, e.g., the torso or legs) to enhance model construction. They propose the unsupervised HAR algorithm, namely USSAR, which efficiently selects the K most similar source domains from a given list. Additionally, they introduce a transfer neural network, dubbed TNNAR, to facilitate knowledge transfer in HAR. TNNAR can capture both temporal and spatial relationships between activities during knowledge transfer. Qian et al. [195] address the issue of DG by proposing a HAR method known as GILE. It is designed to automatically disentangle domain-independent and domain-specific features, with the former expected to remain"}, {"title": "VI. OPEN ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS", "content": "Crowd transfer learning extends the traditional knowledge transfer and plays a significant role in the AIoT scenario. Although its key challenges and techniques have been investi-gated in Section III and IV, there are still some open directions to be further researched. In this section, we mainly introduce them from the following six aspects (See Fig. 14): Cogni-tive foundations of crowd knowledge transfer, transferability measurement mechanisms, learning in resource-constrained IoT devices, decurity in crowd knowledge transfer, continuous crowd knowledge transfer and evolution, and hybrid human-machine intelligence.\nA. Cognitive Foundations of Crowd Knowledge Transfer\nThe cognitive foundations of crowd knowledge transfer can provide theoretical guidance for the crowd knowledge transfer, better design the crowd knowledge transfer model, and enhance the performance of the transfer model. From the perspective of the sources of knowledge transfer, the research about the cognitive foundations of crowd knowledge transfer can include continuous learning theory (transfer of own past knowledge) and social learning theory (transfer of others\u2019 knowledge), as shown in Fig. 15.\n1) Continuous learning theory: Continuous learning [256]\u2013[258] can continuously process data streams in the real world, retaining and even integrating and optimizing old knowledge while absorbing new knowledge. One of the most significant challenges is catastrophic forgetting, that is, training a model with new data interferes with the previously learned knowledge, decreasing the model performance [259]. Humans and other well-adapted animals can make appropriate decisions about new events based on previous continuous learned events [256]. Most of this ability to acquire, refine, and transfer knowledge is attributed to brain mechanism [260].\nFirst of all, there is a multisensory system in which the visual cortex and auditory cortex of the brain can perceive visual and auditory signals respectively [261], and then the thalamus dynamically controls the transmission of perceptual signals from the periphery to the cortex, integrating mul-tisensory information [262]. In this process, to adapt and reflect changes in the external environment, the nervous system produces structural and functional changes and maintains these changes for a certain period of time [263]. For structural changes, the central nervous system (CNS) can produce new neurons for new events to adapt to new tasks and skills, while for functional changes, neurotransmitters released by neuromodulatory neurons can help overcome catastrophic for-getting, and improve the understanding of uncertain environ-ments and new tasks. For example, inspired by the plasticity of functional structures, NISPA [264] achieves the goal of continuous learning through sparse neural networks with fixed density. And SparCL [265] realizes cost-effective continuous learning on edge devices through the sparsity of network structure. During the process, modularity plays an important role [266], [267]. The system can perform specific functions without interfering with the rest of the system when the structure is modular, which reducing the dependencies of components, improving the system robustness and prompting the system adaptability and evolution. For example, Gallen et al. [268] propose that brain modularity is a key biomarker that can predict cognitive plasticity, indicating that modular networks have stronger adaptability and are better at learning and problem-solving. When new memories are stored, the brain needs to generalize various experiences while training situational memories. The complementary learning system (CLS) theory [269], [270] suggests that the hippocampus uses fast learning methods to encode sparse representations to reduce interference. This learned information is then put back into the neocortical system so that overlapping representations of knowledge are retained for a long time. Furthermore, the generalization-optimized complementary learning systems (Go-CLS) theory [271] suggests that the predictability of episodic memory needs to be considered to transfer partial hippocampal-cortical memory and optimize the generalization accuracy of the neocortex. Gepperth and Karaoguz [272] pro-pose GeppNet+STM model inspired by CLS theory, in which GeppNet, a long-term memory learning module including self-organizing map and linear regression classification, can avoid the interference of old and new knowledge and alleviate the"}, {"title": "VII.

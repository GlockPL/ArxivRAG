(2024). As a result, when a language model completes a prompt,\nthe generated response implicitly encodes a mixture of voices from human authors that have pro-\nduced the training text from which the completion has been extrapolated. Although this nature\nof language models has been overlooked due to its marginal influence in current widely-adopted\nusages of LLMs, such as factual question-answering (QA) and algorithmic reasoning, when the\nmodel is queried with open-ended questions or is intended to be conditioned as particular personas,\nit is critical to address the fact that these models inherently reflect an averaged voice from the mixture\nof human authorship."}, {"title": "Conditioning LLMs to Virtual Personas via an Anthology of Backstories", "content": "In this section, we discuss details of the proposed Anthology approach. We start with answering the\ncore question: What are backstories and how might they help condition LLMs to particular personas\nwhen given as context? With an example, we examine and lay out the advantages of conditioning\nmodels with backstories in Section 2.1."}, {"title": "What are Backstories?", "content": "We use the term backstories to refer to first-person narratives that encompass various aspects of an\nindividual's life, from where and how they grew up, their formative experiences, education, career,\nand personal relationships, to their values and beliefs. These stories are inherently open-ended and\npersonal, touching upon diverse facets of the author's demographic and personality traits.\nConsider the example shown in Figure 3. We observe that the life story both explicitly and im-\nplicitly encodes information about the author, thereby providing rich insight into who the author is.\nFor instance, the backstory provides explicit hints about the author's age (\u201cin my 60s\u201d), hometown\nand/or region (\u201cbackwoods of this country\u201d), and financial status during childhood (\u201cgrew up\nwith very little\u201d). But rather than being a simple listing of the aforementioned traits, the story itself\nembodies a natural, authentic voice of a particular human that reflects their values and personality.\nMcAdams (1993); Bruner (1991).\nOur proposed approach is to condition language models with backstories by placing them as a\nprefixes to the LLM Brown et al. (2020); Touvron et al. (2023) so as to strongly condition the ensuing text\ncompletion, in the same spirit of standard prompting approaches. As we see in Figure 3, backstories\ncapture a wide range of attributes about the author through high levels of detail and are naturalistic\nnarratives that provide realism and consistency of the persona to which the LLM is conditioned."}, {"title": "LLM-Generated Backstories", "content": "A collection of human-written backstories could be drawn from existing sets of autobiographies or\noral history collections. The challenge, however, is both in terms of scale and diversity Yang et al.\n(2023, 2022). We find that, in their current standing, publicly available sources of autobiographical\nlife narratives and oral histories are limited in the number of samples to sufficiently approximate\nlarger human studies.\nInstead, we propose to generate conceivably realistic backstories with language models as cost-\nefficient alternatives. As shown in Step 1 of Figure 2, we prompt LLMs with an open-ended prompt\nsuch as, \u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d We specifically care for the prompt to be simple so that the\nmodel responses are unconstrained and not biased. The prompt, however, does implicitly ask for\na comprehensive narrative. Responding to this prompt requires the language model to generate a\nseries of interconnected events and experiences that form a coherent life trajectory, which inherently\nimplies consistency and progression as in Figure 3. With sampling temperature T = 1.0, we generate\nbackstories that encapsulate a broad range of life experiences of diverse human users. Further details\nabout LLM generation of backstories, including examples, are summarized in Appendix B."}, {"title": "Demographic Survey on Virtual Personas", "content": "As we intend to utilize virtual personas in the context of approximating human respondents in\nbehavioral studies, it is critical that we curate an appropriate set of backstories that would condition\npersonas representing the target human population. Each study would have a specific set of demo-\ngraphic variables and an estimation or accurate statistics of the demographics of its respondents.\nNaturalistic backstories, despite their rich details about the individual authors, are however not\nguaranteed to explicitly mention all demographic variables of interest. Therefore, we emulate the\nprocess of how the demographic traits of human respondents have been collected\u2014performing\ndemographic surveys on virtual personas, as shown in Step 2 of Figure 2.\nWhile we use the same set of demographic questions as used in the human studies, we consider\nthat, unlike human respondents who each have a well-defined, deterministic set of traits, LLM virtual\npersonas should be described with a probabilistic distribution of demographic variables. As such,\nwe sample multiple responses for each demographic question to estimate the distribution of traits\nfor the given virtual persona. Further details about the process and prompts used in demographic\nsurveys are described in Appendix E."}, {"title": "Matching Target Human Populations", "content": "The remaining question is: How do we choose the right set of backstories for each survey to approx-\nimate? With the results of the demographic survey, we match virtual personas to the real human\npopulation, presented as Step 3 in Figure 2. In doing so, we construct a complete weighted bipartite\ngraph defined by the tuple, G = (H, V, E).\nThe vertex set H = {h1, h2, ..., hn} represents the human user group with the size of n, while the\nother vertex set V = {V1, V2, ..., vm} represents the virtual user group with the size of m. Each vertex\nhi consists of demographic traits of i-th human user. Specifically, h\u2081 = (ti1, ti2, ..., tik) where k is the\nnumber of demographic variables, and til is the l\u2014th demographic variable's trait of i\u2014th user. Sim-\nilarly, for each vertex in V, vj comprises probability distributions of demographic variables of each\nvirtual user, defined as vj = (P(dj1), P(dj2), ..., P(djk)), where d\u2081\u2081 is j\u2212th user's l\u2013th demographic\nrandom variable and $P(d_{ji})$ is its probability distribution.\nThe edge set comprises eij \u2208 E which denotes the edge between h\u2081 and vj. The weight of an edge,\nw(eij) or equivalently w(hi, vj), is defined as the product of the likelihoods of traits of the j-th virtual\nuser that correspond to the demographic traits of the i\u2013th human user. We formally define such\nedge weights:\n$w(e_{ij})=w(h_i, v_j) = \\prod_{l=1}^k P(d_{jl}=t_{il})$\nWe perform bipartite matching to select the virtual personas whose demographic probability dis-\ntributions are most similar to the real, human user population. The objective is to find the matching\nfunction \u03c0: [n] \u2192 [m], where [n] = {1,2,3,...n} and [m] = {1,2,3,...m} that maximize the following:\n$\\pi^* = \\underset{\\pi}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\sum_{i=1}^n w(h_i, V_{\\pi(i)})$\nWe explore two matching methods: (1) maximum weight matching, and (2) greedy matching. First,\nmaximum weight matching is the method that finds the optimal \u03c0* with the objective of Eq. 2, while\nensuring that \u03c0 establishes a one-to-one correspondence between users. We employ the Hungarian\nmatching algorithm Kuhn (1955) to determine \u03c0*. On the other hand, greedy matching seeks to\nmaximize the same objective without requiring a one-to-one correspondence. It determines the\noptimal matching function such that\n$\\pi^* (i) = \\underset{j}{\\operatorname{argmax}} w(h_i, v_j)$\nwhere each human user is assigned to the virtual persona with the highest weight, allowing multiple\nhuman users assigned to the same virtual persona.\nAfter completing the matching process, we assign the demographic traits of the target population\nto the matched backstories. In downstream surveys, we append these demographic information to\nbackstories and use the matched subset of backstories, resulting in the same number of backstories\nas that of the target human population."}, {"title": "Approximating Human Studies with LLM Personas", "content": "In this section, we discuss the large-scale human studies that we aim to approximate (Step 4 of\nFigure 2) using LLM virtual subjects, based on varying methods of persona conditioning.

This involves repeatedly dividing the human population into\ntwo equal-sized groups at random and calculating these metrics between the sub-groups. We take\naveraged values from 100 iterations to represent the lower-bound estimates."}, {"title": "Approximating Diverse Human Subjects", "content": "We further evaluate Anthology against other baseline conditioning methods in terms of the Diver-\nsity criterion outlined in Section 3.

The results of comparisons involving other demographic variables are detailed\nin Appendix A.2. We choose the Llama-3-70B model and Anthology using natural backstories and\nwith greedy matching as our method and employ evaluation metrics as in Section 4.1.\nAs summarized in Table 2, Anthology outperforms other methods. Notably, Anthology achieves\nthe lowest average Wasserstein distances and the highest Cronbach's alpha for all sub-groups. Specif-\nically, the gap in the Wasserstein distance between Anthology and the second-best method is 0.029 for\nthe 18-49+ age group, showing a 14.5% difference . These results validate that Anthology is effective\nin approximating diverse demographic populations than prior methods.\nIntriguingly, for every subgroup except those aged 18-49, all methods show worse average\nWasserstein distance compared to the results approximating the entire human respondents pre-"}, {"title": "Sampling Backstories to Match Target Demographics", "content": "Next, we study the effect of matching strategies, greedy and max weight matching. In Tab. 3, we\ncompare these methods with random matching, which assigns the traits of the target demographic\ngroup to randomly sampled backstories. This comparison is conducted on ATP Wave 34 using both\nLlama-3-70B and Mixtral2-8x22B models.\nWe observe that our matching methods consistently outperform random matching in terms of the\naverage Wasserstein distance across all models. Notably, for example, with Llama-3-70B, the average\nWasserstein distance between random matching and greedy matching shows an 18% difference. The\ngap is even more pronounced in the Frobenius norm, marking a 27% difference. This result implies\nthat inconsistent matching between backstories and the target human distribution can significantly\nimpact the effectiveness of the metrics. Therefore, careful matching is crucial to ensure the reliability\nand validity of the results in our study."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Generating Personas with LLMS Recent advancements in language model applications have\nexpanded into simulating human responses for psychological, economic, and social studies (Karra\net al., 2023; Aher et al., 2023; Binz and Schulz, 2023; Horton, 2023; Fatouros et al., 2024; Argyle\net al., 2023). Specifically, the generation of personas using LLMs to respond to textual stimuli has\nbeen explored in various contexts including human-computer interaction (HC), multi agent system,\nanalysis on biases in LLMs, and personality evaluation. (Kim et al., 2020; Simmons, 2022; Park et al.,\n2022; Santurkar et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024b; Choi and Li, 2024; Liu et al., 2024a; Wu et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2023; Hilliard et al., 2024; Serapio-Garc\u00eda et al., 2023; Hu and Collier, 2024; Hwang et al., 2023;\nAbdulhai et al., 2023). For instance, Park et al. (2022) and Santurkar et al. (2023) develop methods\nto prime LLMs with crafted personas, influencing the models' outputs to simulate targeted user\nresponses. Additionally, Liu et al. (2024a) introduces a method where personas are generated by\nsampling demographic traits coupled with either congruous or incongruous political stances. Our\napproach, Anthology, advances this concept by employing dynamically generated, richly detailed\nbackstories that include a broad spectrum of demographic and economic characteristics, enhancing\nthe granularity and authenticity of simulated responses.\nLLMs in Social Science Studies The integration of LLMs into social science research has been\nsteadily gaining attention, as highlighted by several studies (Bail et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023a;\nDillion et al., 2023; Ziems et al., 2023; Korinek, 2023). Notably, the use of LLMs to mimic human\nresponses to survey stimuli has gained popularity, as evidenced by recent research (Tjuatja et al., 2023;\nDominguez-Olmedo et al., 2023; Kim and Lee, 2024). A notable example is the \"media diet model\u201d\nby Chu et al. (2023), which predicts consumer group responses based on their media consumption\npatterns. Further, studies like Wu et al. (2023) and Ziems et al. (2023) demonstrate the potential of\nLLMs in zero-shot learning settings to analyze political ideologies and scale computational social\nscience tools.

Despite these models achieving better results on several\nbenchmarks Gao et al. (2023); Hendrycks et al. (2021); Chiang et al. (2024), they do not adequately\napproximate human responses for this survey. Additionally, the other interesting observation is that\nthe best-performing model in terms of approximation to human responses is Llama-3-8B, which\nis the smallest model among those evaluated. We hypothesize that fine-tuning LLMs including\ninstruction fine-tune, RLHF, DPO Rafailov et al. (2023); Ouyang et al. (2022); Chung et al. (2022)\nmakes them converge to a singular persona Park et al. (2023b); Anwar et al. (2024); Bommasani et al.\n(2022a), which makes LLMs unsuitable for the tasks that requires diverse responses.

This con-\nvergence potentially renders LLMs less suitable for tasks requiring diverse responses, consequently\nmaking larger fine-tuned models less effective at approximating the varied responses of humans.\nThis finding aligns with the insights from Santurkar et al. (2023) discussing that the base models\nare more steerable than fine-tuned models, and suggests the need for careful model selection for this\nspecific task Liang et al. (2023)\nWe observe that the Llama-3-8B model exhibits a higher Cronbach's alpha value. This increased\nconsistency is attributed to the model's tendency to select responses same as previously generated\nresponses Zheng et al. (2023); Pezeshkpour and Hruschka (2023); Zheng et al. (2024), resulting in\nmore correlated responses over survey questions. Consequently, this leads to a higher Cronbach's\nalpha compared to the results shown in Table 1, even though the average Wasserstein distance is\nsignificantly higher."}, {"title": "Subgroup Comparisons for Other Demographic Variables", "content": "Here, continuing the discussion in Section. 4.2, we evaluate the Diversity criterion (Section. 3) on\nthe methods with other subgroups.

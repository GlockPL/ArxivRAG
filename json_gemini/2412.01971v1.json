Data acquired with such measurement geometries are referred to as half-scan data, as only half of a complete spherical measurement aperture is employed. Although previous studies have demonstrated that half-scan data can uniquely and stably reconstruct the sought-after object, no closed-form reconstruction formula for use with half-scan data has been reported. To address this, a semi-analytic reconstruction method in the form of filtered backprojection (FBP), referred to as the half-scan FBP method, is developed in this work. Because the explicit form of the filtering operation in the half-scan FBP method is not currently known, a learning-based method is proposed to approximate it. The proposed method is systematically investigated by use of virtual imaging studies of 3D breast PACT that employ ensembles of numerical breast phantoms and a physics-based model of the data acquisition process. The method is subsequently applied to experimental data acquired in an in vivo breast PACT study. The results confirm that the half-scan FBP method can accurately reconstruct 3D images from half-scan data. Importantly, because the sought-after inverse mapping is well-posed, the reconstruction method remains accurate even when applied to data that differ considerably from those employed to learn the filtering operation.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "PHOTOACOUSTIC computed tomography (PACT), also known as optoacoustic tomography, is a rapidly developing imaging modality with great potential for a wide range of biomedical applications [1]\u2013[3]. In PACT, a short laser pulse irradiates the object, leading to the absorption of optical energy [4]. This absorbed energy induces a localized rise in acoustic pressure due to the photoacoustic effect [5]. The resulting acoustic waves travel through the object and surrounding medium and are subsequently measured by ultrasonic transducers. From these measurements, the initial pressure distribution can be estimated by use of a tomographic reconstruction method [6]\u2013[8]. PACT offers high optical contrast with inherent functional information in the near-infrared wavelength range, where hemoglobin is one of the major endogenous optical molecular chromophores. It also achieves relatively high resolution, since the photoacoustic signals propagate as acoustic waves, which experience significantly less scattering than light by several orders of magnitude [9]\u2013[11]. Such capabilities enable PACT to provide detailed structural and functional information about the distributions of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration in tissues, making it a promising technique for cancer diagnosis and early screening by assessing tumor angiogenesis and hypoxia [12]\u2013[14].\nA variety of analytic reconstruction methods have been proposed for three-dimensional (3D) PACT [15]\u2013[21]. Many of these methods employ filtered backprojection (FBP)-type approaches, where reconstruction is facilitated by first filtering measurement data and subsequently backprojecting this filtered data into the image domain [15], [20], [21]. The derivations of FBP-based inversion formulae assume that photoacoustic signals are measured over certain canonical closed surfaces that enclose the object [15], [20], [21]. In certain modalities, such as 3D PACT breast imaging, physical constraints limit the measurement aperture for data acquisition. For example, in clinical breast imaging applications, hemispherical measurement surfaces [10] are employed. When standard FBP methods are directly applied to measurement data acquired with hemispherical measurement geometries, the resulting reconstructed images can exhibit inaccuracies and noticeable artifacts [22]. Hereafter, the data acquired with such a hemispherical measurement geometry will be referred to as half-scan data, with the assumption that the to-be-imaged object resides within the convex hull of the measurement aperture. Similarly, data acquired over a spherical surface that encloses the object will be referred to as full-scan data. Previous studies have shown that half-scan data uniquely"}, {"title": "II.

Here, $t \\in [0, T]$ is the temporal coordinate confined to the acquisition period $T$, with tissue excitation assumed to occur at $t = 0$. Considering that the to-be-imaged object is acoustically homogeneous and lossless, with acoustic properties matching those of the acoustic coupling medium, the canonical forward operator can be described as [35]:\n\\[\np(r_0,t) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi c_0 t} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} dr \\; p_0(r) \\; \\delta \\left( t - \\frac{|r_0-r|}{c_0} \\right) = H_{cc} p_0,\n\\]\nwhere $H_{cc} : L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3) \\rightarrow L^2(\\Omega_0 \\times [0,T])$ denotes the C-C imaging operator, $\\delta(t)$ represents the one-dimensional Dirac delta function, $c_0$ is the constant speed of sound (SOS), and $V$ denotes the object support."}, {"title": "B.

The measured data samples can be lexicographically ordered and represented as the vector $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times 1}$, where $M = N_q N_t$. Assuming idealized point-like transducers, the measured signal $[p]_{qN_t+w}$, recorded at time $t = w \\Delta t$ by the $q$-th transducer, is expressed as the $(qN_t+w)$-th element of the vector $p$:\n\\[\n[p]_{qN_t+w} = p \\left( r_0, t \\right) \\Big|_{r_0=r_q, t=w \\Delta t},\n\\quad w=0,..., N_t-1\n\\quad q=0,...,N_q-1\n\\]\nTo establish a D-D imaging model, the continuous object $p_0(r)$ is approximated by use of a finite-dimensional representation:\n\\[\np_0(r) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} [f]_n \\phi_n(r),\n\\]\nwhere $[f]_n$ is the $n$-th element of the coefficient vector $f \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$, and $\\{\\phi_n(r)\\}_{n=0}^{N-1}$ is a set of given expansion functions.

In this study, an interpolation-based D-D imaging model was employed, with the expansion function chosen as piecewise linear basis functions [35].

Details regarding the construction of $H$ are available in [35]."}, {"title": "C. Image Reconstruction from Half-scan Data", "content": "The direct application of analytic methods designed for full-scan data to reconstruct images from half-scan data can result in arc-shaped artifacts and loss of accuracy [28]. These artifacts appear as concentric arcs, centered at the endpoints of the open measurement surface and tangent to the object boundary [37]. As illustrated by the example in Fig. 1 (a), these arc-shaped artifacts are present in the image reconstructed from half-scan data using the standard FBP method, where the object boundaries parallel to the plane formed by the endpoints of the open measurement surface (the x-y plane at z=0) appear blurred.\nDespite the fact that closed-form exact reconstruction formulae for use with half-scan data have not been identified, mathematical analyses on the invertibility of the C-C imaging model have yielded encouraging results. Specifically, it has been established that an object can be uniquely [23], [30] and stably [26] reconstructed from half-scan data. These findings established that the associated inverse problem in an infinite-dimensional vector space setting is well-posed. Iterative reconstruction methods can accurately reconstruct finite-dimensional object estimates from discrete samples of half-scan data [22], [23], [30].

From the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $H$ [33], a mathematical expression for the optimal linear filtering operator $F_{opt} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times M}$ can be derived. However, computing the SVD of the large-scale imaging operator $H$ in three dimensions is computationally challenging [39]. As a more practical alternative, the optimal filtering operator can be approximated by use of a supervised learning approach [33] as described next."}, {"title": "B. Overview of the Learned Half-scan FBP Method", "content": "In the proposed method, the optimal data filtering operator $F_{opt}$ discussed above is approximated by use of a deep neural network, which is linear with respect to the measured half-scan data $p$. This network is denoted as $F_{\\theta} : \\mathbb{R}^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^M$, where the vector $\\theta$ denotes the trainable network parameters. In this case, the task of estimating the optimal filtering operator can be interpreted as determining the parameter vector $\\theta$ from a set of training data. Here, the training data consist of arbitrary pairs of objects $f^{(k)}$ and the corresponding half-scan measurement data $p^{(k)} = H f^{(k)}$, where the integer $k$ is an index specifying each training sample. According to (5), the optimal parameter vector $\\theta$ should satisfy $f^{(k)} = H^{\\dagger} F_{\\theta} p^{(k)}, \\forall k$.\nTherefore, to train the data filtering network $F_{\\theta}$, the following optimization problem is approximately solved:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\mathcal{L}\\left( f^{(k)}, H^{\\dagger} F_{\\theta} p^{(k)} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere $K$ represents the number of training samples.

Because of the well-posed nature of the inverse problem and the incorporation of imaging physics through $H^{\\dagger}$, the method is expected to perform well even when applied to measurement data that significantly differ from those employed for the filtering network training. In contrast, image-to-image-based DL approaches for image reconstruction are prone to producing image hallucinations [33], [40]. These hallucinations can arise due to the heavy reliance of such methods on learning features in the image domain, making them more susceptible to generating false structures."}, {"title": "C. Network Architecture in the Learned Half-scan FBP Framework", "content": "The following details regarding the assumed imaging system configuration are relevant to the specification of the data filtering network. Motivated by an existing 3D PACT breast imager [10], the system was assumed to comprise an arc-shaped acoustic measurement probe that was rotated in discrete steps to acquire data samples on a hemispherical measurement aperture. This configuration is parameterized by $N_r$, $N_v$, and $N_t$, which denote the number of transducer elements on the arc-shaped probe (ring dimension), the number of tomographic views (view dimension), and the number of time samples (time dimension), respectively."}, {"title": "1) Linear 3D U-Net Architecture:", "content": "Given that the half-scan data $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N_t N_q \\times 1}$, with $N_q = N_r N_v$, can be represented as a 3D tensor, a 3D U-Net model was employed to approximate the existing but unknown filtering operator. The 3D U-Net model was chosen as a canonical example of a deep neural network that has been widely deployed in medical imaging applications [41], [42]; however, alternative network models can also be employed for data filtering. Moreover, for the considered problem, the sought-after inverse mapping is inherently linear. Therefore, a linear version of the 3D U-Net was adopted by excluding all nonlinear structures.\nThe employed linear 3D U-Net consisted of encoder and decoder modules. The encoder was comprised of a series of convolution blocks (ConvBlocks) and downsampling layers, enabling the extraction of multi-scale feature representations. The downsampling layer was implemented using a 3D convolution with a kernel size of 3\\times3\\times3, a stride of 2, and an output channel size equal to the input channel size.

Padding Approach for Half-scan Data", "content": "To preserve the input dimensions through ConvBlocks, padding must be applied at the boundaries of the input data. However, the commonly used zero padding can introduce inconsistencies near these boundaries, potentially affecting the learning process for the data filtering network. To maintain consistent features of the input, the padding strategy in ConvBlocks was designed based on the configuration of the assumed imaging system. This approach effectively approximates data that are physically unmeasured at the padding positions, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (b). For the view dimension, where tomographic views exhibited $2\\pi$ periodicity, cyclic padding was employed to maintain azimuthal continuity. In the time dimension, assuming temporally untruncated measurement, zero padding was applied, as pressure traces outside the measured time range were considered negligible. Along the ring dimension, a learned padding approach was implemented, employing learned values to account for the unmeasured data beyond the transducer arc. This process began by extracting the first and last five elements of the input data along the ring axis, which were then processed through 1\\times1\\times9 convolution layers (Conv1). The outputs from Conv1 were subsequently concatenated with the original input data along the ring axis."}, {"title": "IV.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "content": "Prior studies have established that PACT image reconstruction from measured data acquired with a hemispherical measurement geometry, i.e., half-scan data, corresponds to a well-posed problem. However, no closed-form inversion formula for this problem is currently available. To address this, the learned half-scan FBP method was proposed, in which a linear deep neural network approximates the unknown data filtering operation for half-scan data.\nThe learned half-scan FBP method achieved high accuracy, even when applied to test data that differed substantially from the training data, as demonstrated by the numerical and experimental studies. Specifically, it was demonstrated that the proposed method achieved reconstruction accuracy comparable to the FISTA-TV reference method, while accelerating image reconstruction by a factor of 1000. More importantly, the learned half-scan FBP method exhibited robust generalizability, even when applied to experimental breast data acquired in an in vivo study.\nThe robust generalizability of the proposed method stems from the fact that inverse problem associated with PACT image reconstruction from half-scan data is well-posed. A recent work by Cam et al. [33] employed a similar strategy, in which a learned FBP method was established for approximately inverting the so-called half-time circular Radon transform. Perhaps the first study that proposed a learned FBP method for a well-posed problem was reported by Floyd [54]. In such applications, the instabilities commonly observed in DL-based image reconstruction approaches [55] are avoided, resulting in reliable and trustworth methods. In addition, learned FBP methods [56], [57] have been investigated, which implement both filtering and backprojection operations via neural networks.\nThe proposed method demonstrated reconstruction accuracy comparable to the reference methods. However, in the virtual imaging studies where full-scan data were available, small discrepancies in MSE and SSIM values were observed between the learned half-scan FBP method and the standard FBP method applied with full-scan data, as shown in Fig. 5. These discrepancies may have resulted from the fact that, having a learned filtering component, the proposed method only approximates the true inverse mapping. Furthermore, full-scan data contain redundancies, whereas half-scan data do not [23], which will result in numerical errors and noise being propagated differently into image space.\nThe half-scan data for network training were simulated with a reference SOS of 1509.15 m/s, chosen empirically. To confirm the trained network's robustness across a range of SOS values possible in in vivo breast imaging, the MSE and SSIM values for the learned half-scan FBP method were evaluated within the reported range of breast tissue SOS values (1447 m/s to 1555 m/s) [58]. The resulting MSE values were 4.6\\times10^{-5}\\pm1.6\\times10^{-6} and SSIM values were 0.997\\pm2\\times10^{-4}, demonstrating the method's robustness across this SOS range. Therefore, for soft tissue PACT imaging where a homogeneous SOS assumption is generally useful, the DL model can be trained with a reference SOS and is expected to maintain high reconstruction accuracy across the SOS range without the need to retrain the model.\nAlthough this study was conducted with a specific PACT imager design, the proposed method can be readily adapted to other PACT imaging system designs. In addition, other D-D imaging operators and their implementations can be adopted, and any suitable DL model can be used for half-scan data filtering."}]}

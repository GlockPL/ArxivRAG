However, the current evaluation\nmethodologies for these systems exhibit notable\nlimitations. First, existing benchmarks primarily\nfocus on problems with limited numerical ranges\n(Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022), leaving a sig-\nnificant gap between the controlled evaluations and\nreal-world settings. Second, traditional grading ap-\nproaches typically compare LLMs' final answers\ndirectly with the ground truth answers (Hong et al.,\n2024; Shakarian et al., 2023), a practice that con-\nflates logical and numerical errors, thereby obscur-\ning a deep understanding of the LLM's reasoning\ncapabilities. This motivates the need for a better\nevaluation approach that not only handles numbers\nacross wide numerical ranges but also distinguishes\nbetween logical and arithmetic errors.\nThis paper makes three contributions. First, we\nintroduce publicly available GSM-Ranges, a tool\nfor generating datasets that are designed to eval-\nuate error rates and error types across diverse nu-\nmerical ranges. Derived from the GSM8K dataset\n(Cobbe et al., 2021), GSM-Ranges systematically\norganizes problems into distinct numerical inter-\nvals.

Several prior\nstudies (Stolfo et al., 2022; Hooda et al., 2024;\nJiang et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024) have explored\nthe sensitivity of LLMs to perturbations in input\nproblems, demonstrating significant performance\ndegradation even when the underlying logic\nremains the same. In the domain of mathematical\nword problems (MWPs), particularly on the\nGSM8K benchmark, this degradation has been\nobserved when numbers are slightly changed\nfrom the original question. (Li et al., 2024a;\nMirzadeh et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023). However,\nexisting approaches often constrain substituted\nvalues to a limited numerical range (Stolfo et al.,\n2022) or use numbers that remain comparable\nto the original values, which tend to be small\n(Li et al., 2024a; Mirzadeh et al., 2024; Madaan\nand Yazdanbakhsh, 2022).

Instead of providing the entire prob-\nlem, we supply the model with a list of extracted\nnumbers from the problem text. This approach is\nmotivated by our observation that providing the full\nproblem tends to lead the model to revise logically\nflawed answers into logically correct ones. This be-\nhavior aligns with the known tendency of LLMs to\nexhibit biases toward generating correct responses\nand their difficulty in intentionally producing incor-\nrect answers (Tjuatja et al., 2023; Kumar and Jain,\n2024).

Surprisingly, however, while the degree varies\namong the models, we observe a consistent upward\ntrend in logical errors as the perturbation level in-\ncreases, across all nine evaluated models (Figure\n3) except GPT-40. To quantify this trend, we cal-\nculate the difference in logical error rates between\nlevel 6 (1M-10M) and level 1 (same digit) pertur-\nbations for each model (Figure 4). The most pro-\nnounced discrepancy is exhibited by the Gemma 2\n2B model, which shows a 14% absolute increase\nin logical error rate. Similarly, the WizardMath 7B\nv1.1 model demonstrates a substantial increase of\n10%. Even the relatively more robust models, such\nas Phi-3 Mini 4K and GPT-3.5 Turbo, still exhibit\nan increase of approximately 4%, which remains\na significant deviation. GPT-40, one of the most\nadvanced models at the time of our study, stands\nout as the only model with a near-zero gap. These\nresults reveal the sensitivity of the models' logical\nreasoning to numerical scales.

(A\nqualitative analysis of additional logical errors in-\nduced by increasing numerical values is provided\nin Appendix A.4.)\nAnother noteworthy observation is that the in-\ncrease in logical errors becomes more gradual at\nhigher perturbation levels. Across all nine models,\nthe gap between level 3 and level 1 is generally\nlarger than that between level 6 and level 3. This\ntrend aligns with the cumulative frequency patterns\nobserved in Figure 1, which shows that low-range\nvalues account for majority of numbers across the\nmost widely used benchmark datasets. While the\nexact composition of training data for the models\nremains unknown, if math-problem training data is\npredominantly concentrated in the lower numerical\nranges, it is plausible that beyond a certain thresh-\nold, further increases in numerical magnitude do\nnot lead to a significant difference in model perfor-\nmance.

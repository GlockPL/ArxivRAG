Medical documentation in a patient's native language can significantly improve\nunderstanding, communication, and overall patient care outcomes, particularly in regions where\nhealthcare professionals and patients may not share a common language, or where nuanced medical\nterminology requires precise understanding. In this regard, Arabic presents unique challenges for\nlanguage models due to its rich morphological structure, complex syntax, and diglossia, [1] which is the\ncoexistence of formal Arabic and regional dialects. Effective scribing and clinical workflow models that\noperate seamlessly in Arabic can facilitate accurate documentation, reduce medical errors, and bridge\ncommunication gaps that are crucial in patient care.\nArabic poses distinct challenges for Al-based language models that are often trained on clinical\ninformation from well-represented Western or Eastern languages, like English or Chinese. [2] Unlike\nthese languages, Arabic is highly inflected, and small changes in root morphology can drastically alter\nword meanings. [3] In clinical contexts, where precision is paramount, capturing these subtleties can\nmean the difference between an accurate diagnosis and potential misinterpretation. Research\nunderscores that while natural language processing (NLP) for Arabic has advanced, especially with\nthe introduction of Arabic-specific models like AraBERT[4] and more recently Inception Al's JAIS, [5] the\nfield still lacks models that perform well in specialized medical domains.\nExisting Arabic models often struggle with terminology specific to clinical documentation, where\nmeanings can vary greatly depending on context \u2013 a problem much exacerbated by the lack of\ncomprehensive medical conversation data that can offer validation.[6] Clinical workflows and\ndocumentation require precise, consistent, and interpretable summaries to be effective; for\nArabic-speaking patients and providers, this demands a model that is tailored to handle these\nlinguistic intricacies with a focus on medical terminology, as well as an ability to contextualize and\nsummarize clinical data in Arabic without struggling with the language's flexibility.\nThis case study examines Sporo AraSum, Sporo Health's advanced language model specifically\ntailored to address these issues in the Arabic domain, and its efficacy in addressing the complexities\nof clinical documentation, scribing, workflow, and decision-making compared to JAIS, the leading\nArabic language model currently available. The study explores how Sporo AraSum's architecture and\ntraining are uniquely optimized to handle medical terminology, syntax, and cultural nuances in Arabic,\nenabling it to better understand and summarize clinical interactions. By comparing Sporo AraSum's\nperformance against JAIS in key areas, the study aims to illustrate Sporo AraSum's potential to elevate\nthe standard of care for Arabic-speaking patients and medical professionals."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Evaluating summary quality using known quantitative metrics\nAlthough there is a lack of proper medical conversation datasets in Arabic, AlMutairi et al. showed that\nsynthetic data created by LLMs can suffice as a data source. [6] We generated 4,000 synthetic\npatient-physician conversations in Arabic using GPT-40, and Al-generated summaries were created\nusing Sporo AraSum and JAIS, then compared to ground truth clinical summaries generated by GPT-40\nand translated to Arabic.\nClinical content recall was defined as the proportion of relevant clinical information from the ground\ntruth summary that was accurately captured in the Al-generated summaries. Salient clinical items\nwere extracted from each conversation into an inventory. Recall was then calculated by dividing the\nnumber of correctly included items from the inventory by the total number of relevant items. Clinical\ncontent precision was defined as the proportion of information that was both accurate and relevant\nwhen compared to the ground truth. Precision was calculated by dividing the number of correctly\nincluded items in the summary by the total number of items, including any additional or incorrect\nitems. This metric reflects the accuracy and relevance of the content without introducing extraneous\nor inaccurate details. Finally, the F1 score is used as a balanced metric to combine both clinical\ncontent precision and recall, providing a single measure of the Al-generated summaries'\nperformance. [7] It represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ensuring that both the\naccuracy of relevant information captured (precision) and the completeness of that information\n(recall) are taken into account. ROUGE scores, ,[8] BLEU, [9] and BERTScore F1[10] were also calculated.\nQualitative evaluation of clinical utility\nThree transcripts of patient-physician conversations covering simple clinical vignettes were created\nin Arabic. The patient presentations for each conversation included a rash caused by new soap, heart\npalpitations and hypertension, and tonsillitis. Al-generated clinical summaries were generated by\nSporo AraSum and JAIS using zero-shot prompting. Each generated clinical summary was compared to\na clinician-generated summary translated into Arabic that served as the ground truth.\nExternal evaluators fluent in Arabic were provided the conversation transcripts and the two\nAl-generated summaries, blinded to the source and consistent in formatting. Summary satisfaction\nwas evaluated in conjunction with accuracy using a modified version of the Physician Documentation\nQuality Instrument revision 9 (PDQI-9). The original PDQI-9 employs a 5-point Likert scale across\nnine attributes to assess note quality. This was modified by Tierney et al. into a ten-item inventory to\nbetter fit the metrics relevant to ambient Al documentation, and is widely used to evaluate\nAl-generated clinical notes. [11],[12] Three additional language-specific attributes, syntactic proficiency,\ndomain-specific linguistic precision, and cultural competence, were added to the inventory for the\nhuman evaluators to assess the model's ability to generate language as native Arabic clinicians do.\nThe attributes evaluated in this modified PDQI-9 are detailed in Table 1."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Figure 1 shows the results of the quantitative analysis of Al-centric metrics on summarization\nperformance. Compared to the ground truth, the Al summary by Sporo AraSum far outperforms JAIS in\ntheir ability to collect relevant clinical information, synthesize medical knowledge, and turn it into\ncomprehensible summaries. In fact, evaluators also noted from the three clinical vignettes that some\nAl summaries generated by JAIS were incomplete, indicating that JAIS is unable to handle the volume\nof medical information necessary for clinical summarization. In contrast, Sporo AraSum's summaries\nwere evaluated both in Arabic and in English translation, and demonstrated far superiority in its ability\nto create comprehensive and accurate summaries across the board.\nTable 2 gives a representative evaluation of the summaries created by Sporo AraSum vs. JAIS. Both\nmodels performed exceptionally well in their ability to synthesize language in the summaries, but the\nscoring of clinical attributes demonstrate large differences in clinical summarization capabilities. This\npreliminary finding demonstrates that for domain-specific purposes in clinical workflow, Sporo AraSum\nis a superior model to be implemented in the clinic than JAIS."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This case study highlights Sporo AraSum's superior capabilities in Arabic clinical documentation and\nworkflow management compared to JAIS, particularly in the context of medical summarization and\ndecision-making support. By addressing the linguistic, cultural, and technical challenges inherent to\nthe Arabic language, Sporo AraSum demonstrates significant advancements in precision, contextual\nunderstanding, and clinical utility, setting a new benchmark for Al models in multilingual healthcare\napplications.\nAddressing Linguistic Complexity\nArabic's linguistic intricacies, including its rich morphological structure and diglossia, pose challenges\nthat many existing Al models struggle to overcome. JAIS, despite being a leading Arabic NLP model,\ndemonstrates limitations in handling domain-specific medical terminology and the nuanced syntax\nrequired for clinical documentation. Sporo AraSum's ability to accurately synthesize and contextualize\nmedical information reflects its robust architecture and specialized training tailored to Arabic's\ncomplexities. The superior F1 scores and evaluator feedback indicate Sporo AraSum's proficiency in\ncapturing subtle linguistic variations and domain-specific vocabulary, ensuring accurate and\ncomprehensive summaries.\nClinical Precision and Workflow Integration\nSporo AraSum consistently outperformed JAIS in metrics such as clinical content recall, precision, and\norganization, as well as qualitative attributes like thoroughness and usefulness. These metrics are\nvital for ensuring that clinical documentation aids in effective patient care and decision-making. The\nmodified PDQI-9 scores further underscore AraSum's ability to generate concise, accurate, and\nculturally competent summaries. For instance, its superior performance in domain-specific linguistic\nprecision and cultural competence demonstrates an understanding of not only medical terminology\nbut also the culturally sensitive language necessary in Arabic-speaking regions. This is particularly\ncrucial for fostering trust and understanding in patient-provider interactions.\nMitigating Risks of Al Hallucination\nOne of the critical concerns in Al-generated documentation is the risk of introducing hallucinations or\ninaccuracies. Both models scored well in this attribute, but Sporo AraSum's consistently high accuracy\nand internal consistency across all test scenarios highlight its reliability. This suggests that Sporo\nAraSum's advanced training methodology minimizes the inclusion of irrelevant or erroneous\ninformation, a key factor in mitigating risks in clinical decision-making.\nUtility in Multilingual and Cross-Cultural Healthcare\nThe findings from this study are not only relevant to Arabic-speaking regions but also have broader\nimplications for the development of multilingual Al models in healthcare. The methodologies behind\nSporo AraSum's creation serves as a blueprint for creating language-specific models that address the"}, {"title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "content": "While Sporo AraSum demonstrates significant improvements over JAIS, this study relies heavily on\nsynthetic data due to the scarcity of real-world clinical datasets in Arabic. While synthetic data has\nproven effective for evaluation, future research should incorporate real-world clinical conversation\ndatasets to validate these findings further. Additionally, expanding evaluations to include a wider\nvariety of clinical scenarios and integrating user feedback from Arabic-speaking healthcare\nprofessionals would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's practical utility.\nFurther exploration is also needed into the integration of Sporo AraSum into clinical workflows,\nparticularly in developing seamless interfaces for real-time documentation and decision support.\nFinally, expanding the model's capabilities to encompass other dialects and regional variations of\nArabic could enhance its applicability across different Arabic-speaking populations."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Sporo Health has produced a track history of outperforming foundational models in domain-specific,\nhealthcare-centric tasks through prior case studies. [13],[14] Sporo AraSum emerged as a powerful tool\nfor Arabic clinical documentation, surpassing the current leading model, JAIS, in addressing linguistic\nand domain-specific challenges. Its ability to generate precise, culturally competent, and clinically\nuseful summaries positions it as a pivotal solution for improving patient care in Arabic-speaking\nregions. This study underscores the potential of tailored Al models to transform multilingual\nhealthcare by bridging language barriers, enhancing communication, and optimizing clinical\nworkflows."}]}

However, only a few studies have focused on the scan-rescan precision of the biomarker estimates, which is important for reproducibility and longitudinal analysis. Here, we propose a cardiac biomarker estimation pipeline that not only focuses on achieving high segmentation accuracy but also on improving the scan-rescan precision of the computed biomarkers, namely left and right ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular myocardial mass. We evaluate two approaches to improve the apical-basal resolution of the segmentations used for estimating the biomarkers: one based on image interpolation and one based on segmentation interpolation. Using a database comprising scan-rescan cine CMR data acquired from 92 subjects, we compare the performance of these two methods against ground truth (GT) segmentations and DL segmentations obtained before interpolation (baseline). The results demonstrate that both the image-based and segmentation-based interpolation methods were able to narrow Bland-Altman scan-rescan confidence intervals for all biomarkers compared to the GT and baseline performances. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing not only on segmentation accuracy but also on the consistency of biomarkers across repeated scans, which is crucial for longitudinal analysis of cardiac function.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is considered the gold-standard for the assessment of the function and morphology of the heart [8].

Each subject underwent the CMR acquisition twice within a short period of time, usually within the same day and using the same scanner. Repositioning of the patient and replanning were carried out for each of the two scans. These CMR scans were acquired using three scanners from Siemens Healthcare (1.5T MAGNETOM Aera, 3T MAGNETOM Vida and MAGNETOM Prisma). For each subject, short-axis (SAX), two-chamber and four-chamber long-axis (LAX) views were acquired. Ground truth (GT) segmentations of the LVBP, RVBP and LV myocardium for the SAX data were manually obtained for the end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) frames.

The model was trained on 4872 SAX cine CMR scans and manual annotations from the UK Biobank [20]. Two more 2D nnU-Net v2 models trained on a subset of 200 cases from the UK Biobank data were used to obtain segmentations of the LVBP, left atrium (LA), and LV myocardium from the two-chamber long-axis view and the LVBP, RVBP, LA, right atrium (RA), and LV myocardium from the four-chamber long-axis view, respectively. The SAX segmentations were used for biomarker estimation for all methods whereas both the SAX and LAX segmentations were used for motion correction (box (a) in Figure 1) as well as in the segmentation interpolation method (box (d))."}, {"title": "2.4 Motion Correction", "content": "A motion correction algorithm [24] was applied to correct the misalignments between slices in the SAX stack due to differing breath-hold positions. This algorithm aimed to find the in-plane translations that maximised the intersection between the DL segmentations of the SAX stack data with those of the two-chamber and four-chamber long-axis data. The translations obtained from this registration process were then applied to the SAX images and DL-produced segmentations, and these were used as input data for the interpolation methods described in the following section."}, {"title": "2.5 Interpolation", "content": "Our approach to improving the precision of biomarker estimates is based on increasing the resolution of SAX images or segmentations in the through-plane direction. Two different methods were investigated: the first was an image-based interpolation of the SAX images, and the second was an interpolation of the SAX segmentations.\nImage-based interpolation: In this approach, we first estimated the non-linear deformations between each pair of adjacent slices in the SAX stack. These estimates were made in two directions, base-to-apex and apex-to-base. The employed registration algorithm was a multi-level 2D B-spline free-form deformation (MFFD) algorithm [14,15,17] implemented in MIRTK. A region of interest was used for the registration, based on masks of the heart formed by the union of the DL segmentations of the LVBP, RVBP, and LV myocardium over all slices. The resulting B-spline control point displacements for each transformation were then scaled by factors in the range [0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9]. The scaled transforms were applied to the source images and resampled using linear interpolation. As a result, interpolated slices were generated at distances proportional to the scaling coefficients. This process was repeated for both registration directions and\nSegmentation-based interpolation: This method, described in [12], used a 3D U-Net to predict dense segmentation label maps from sparse 2D SAX and LAX segmentations. The input data for this model was a sparse representation of the heart obtained from the intersection of the SAX segmentations with the two- and four-chamber LAX segmentations. The dense segmentation estimates produced by the model were then used to compute the same cardiac biomarkers described above."}, {"title": "2.6 Evaluation", "content": "First, to assess accuracy, the mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (\u039c\u0391\u0395) between the ground truth (GT) and predicted biomarkers were compared for the three methods: baseline (pre-interpolation), image-based interpolation, and segmentation-based interpolation.\nSecond, to assess precision, the scan-rescan variability of estimates of LVEF, RVEF, and LVM was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. This was performed for the (human) GT, the DL segmentations before interpolation (baseline) and the segmentations produced using both of the interpolation techniques. Coefficient of variation between scan and rescan was computed for each cardiac biomarker. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the results was carried out by generating visual representations of the DL produced segmentations."}, {"title": "3 Experiments and Results", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Quantitative analysis", "content": "To quantify precision, Bland-Altman plots for each biomarker are shown in Figure 2 for the GT and the DL-based methods, and Table 2 shows the Bland-Altman confidence intervals (expressed as mean \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7 standard deviation)."}, {"title": "3.2 Qualitative analysis", "content": "Scan B\nScan A"}, {"title": "4 Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "This study has focused on using interpolation methods to estimate cardiac biomarkers from cine CMR data, with the aim to improve scan-rescan precision. Two different methods were assessed to evaluate the effect of through-plane interpolation of the SAX data on the repeatability of biomarker estimation. The first one was an image-based interpolation approach, and the second was a segmentation-based interpolation method. All experiments were performed on a database of scan-rescan cine CMR data from 92 subjects.\nFirst, to assess the accuracy of the segmentations obtained after applying the two interpolation methods, the ME and MAE were computed between the GT cardiac volumes at ED and ES, and the DL-derived ones. Due to the different granularity (i.e. through-plane resolution) of the original SAX stack (and hence the GT segmentations) and the interpolated data, direct comparisons of error values between lower resolution and higher resolution data should be treated with caution. However, such a comparison does serve as a general indicator of the accuracy of the computed biomarkers. As seen in Table 1, both post-interpolation segmentations obtained error values similar to the ones obtained from the baseline approach, with the image-based interpolation method showing accuracy higher than the baseline for most of the cardiac biomarkers.\nScan-rescan precision was evaluated through Bland-Altman confidence limits and coefficient of variation. As summarised in Figure 2 and Table 2, both interpolation methods showed good agreement between scan and rescan for LVEF, RVEF, and LVM. For LVEF and RVEF, the GT scan-rescan agreement was higher than the baseline, whereas the use of interpolation, whether image- or segmentation-based, always improved the agreement of scan-rescan biomarkers. This outcome not only shows the potential of the presented methods to enhance the precision of biomarker estimation, but also highlights the need for methods that focus on improving agreement between scans of the same subject, rather than solely prioritising accuracy against GT segmentations.\nIn line with the results shown from the Bland-Altman analysis, the coefficient of variation values in Table 2 indicate that both interpolation approaches achieved better precision between scan and rescan biomarkers compared to the baseline approach and, in most cases, were also able to improve on the GT precision.\nOther methods that focus on increasing the through-plane resolution of the SAX stack have been proposed [3,19,23] but these have not yet been evaluated for their impact on scan-rescan precision. Future work will focus on improving the proposed image-based interpolation method by including LAX data to enable better identification of the basal plane of the heart, which can be used as cut off\nwhen segmenting the SAX stack, and on evaluating other learning-based image interpolation approaches, such as the ones mentioned above. However, we believe that the results presented here serve as a valuable proof of concept, demonstrating that interpolation can enhance the agreement in scan-rescan biomarkers, bringing us closer to reliable longitudinal analysis of changes in cardiac function."}]}

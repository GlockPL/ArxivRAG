An exciting area\nof significant industrial impact is in modelling chemical\nreactions [5]. The study of chemical reactions is funda-\nmentally important across various industries, providing\ninsights crucial for innovation, product quality, and en-\nvironmental management. This has led to significant ef-\nforts in developing specific optimization strategies [6, 8, 9].\nHowever, modelling chemical reactions are non trivial and\noften requires you to solve stiff ordinary differential equa-\ntions (ODEs) within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nsimulations [1]. Stiff chemical kinetics are computation-\nally expensive to solve within CFD simulations which has\nprompted various deep learning based techniques to solve\nsuch problems including ResNet [2], Physics informed\nNeural Network [3], Autoencoders [1] and Deep Opera-\ntor Networks [5] to model chemical reactions. Despite\nsome promising results from the aforementioned SciML\nmethods, the issue of solving such stiff chemically reacting\nproblems within the CFD framework remains a significant\nissue. In this study we propose a novel approach to learn-\ning stiff chemical kinetics using an MLP-Mixer method\nnamed PatchTSMixer [4], a promising base architecture\nfor time-series foundation models. We test this method\non the Robertson (ROBER) system [7], which is highly\nprominent in the field of chemical kinetics and often used\nas a standard for evaluating and comparing different nu-\nmerical techniques. Our results provide evidence towards\nthe industrial utility of the MLP-Mixer architecture for\nmodeling and forecasting chemical kinetics."}, {"title": "2 Models and Experiments", "content": "Chemical Kinetic System. The ROBER system is a non-\nlinear coupled ODE system designed to model the chem-\nical kinetics of an autocatalytic reaction, see Eq (1).

This compari-\nson is presented in Fig 2 for the final 20,000 timesteps of\nthe evolution. We find that the extrapolation predictions\nof the chemical species y obtained from PatchTSMixer\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively match the evolution\nfrom the numerical solver. We evaluated the relative error\nfor each extrapolation batch, corresponding to forecasts\nof 100 time steps, and found a mean error of 0.0166%\nwith a standard deviation of 0.0008%. We observed that\nPatchTSMixer is not so robust when used in dynamic ex-\ntrapolation (when we use the output of a forecast batch\nto feed the next one) and it starts to deviate. However,\nit is possible that it can be enhanced with better choices\nof context and forecast dimensions. In Fig 2, we plot the\ncurve composed of the batchwise forecasts. It is possible\nto verify that even though there is an apparent smoothing,\nPatchTSMixer actually produces outputs with very small\nfluctuations, not visible at the scale of the plots. These\ncharacteristics persist for the additional tests, see Apx. B.\nWe anticipate that this issue can be alleviated through a\nmore in-depth investigation of its hyperparameters. These\nresults provide evidence that PatchTSMixer can accurately\ncapture and forecast stiff chemical kinetics and motivate\nthe use of the MLP-Mixer method as a base architecture\nfor time-series forecasting foundation models."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "In this study we applied a recently proposed MLP-Mixer\narchitecture, PatchTSMixer, in a novel SciML context to\nmodel the time-series evolution of stiff chemical kinetics\nwhich is of significant importance in industry.

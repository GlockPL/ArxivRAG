One of the capsize effect of information sharing on Social media includes the spread of sensitive information on the public domain. With the digital gadget market becoming highly competitive and ever-evolving, the trend of an increasing number of sensitive posts leaking information on devices in social media is observed. Many web-blogs on digital gadget market have mushroomed recently, making the problem of information leak all pervasive. Credible leaks on specifics of an upcoming device can cause a lot of financial damage to the respective organization. Hence, it is crucial to assess the credibility of the platforms that continuously post about a smartphone or digital gadget leaks. In this work, we analyze the headlines of leak web-blog posts and their corresponding official press-release. We first collect 54, 495 leak and press-release headlines for different smartphones. We train our custom NER model to capture the evolving smartphone names with an accuracy of 82.14% on manually annotated results. We further propose a credibility score metric for the web-blog, based on the number of falsified and authentic smartphone leak posts.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "One of the capsize effect of information sharing on Social media is an abundance of alleged Information leaks of various sorts. The abundance of such alleged leaks can be credited to the growth in the number of people who post and consume news through social media. Among various social media platforms that post information leaks, one of the major sources are Web-blogs. In recent times, many web-blogs have mushroomed that feature posts about information leaks, especially related to smartphones. We believe, the credible leaks on the upcoming devices can cause a lot of financial damage to the respective organization. Thus, it becomes crucial to continuously assess the credibility of the platforms that post about these leaks.\nThe study on information leak have previously focused on Organizational [5] as well as Personal Leaks [14, 22]. The study of Organizational leaks has focused on assigning policy to documents which are shared within or outside the organization. While, the Users perspective on information leak focuses on privacy concerns for the users who share their information in the public domain. However, for our work, we define leak as any information of a smartphone or gadget which is not yet officially launched by the company, irrespective of the fact that the leak might be falsified later. The web-blogs have become a huge source of information about the ongoing projects as well as new releases for Smartphone companies. This is evident from the difference in Bounce rate\u00b9 of different websites as shown in Table 1, which shows the difference between the traffic received by the official press-release website as compared to the web-blogs which post leaks of the same product. We use Alexa \u00b2, to find out that the traffic on the web-blogs that post about leaked smartphone have greater percentage of visits of a single page view than the official press-release of the same smartphone. This indicates how pervasive the leak web-blogs have become in recent times.\nIrrespective of authenticity, the leaks take away the opportunity of official unveiling of the product from the stakeholders [1]. This seals the fate of the smartphones before it had the chance to enter the market. One of the many effects these leaks have is, it can hamper the sale of products which are currently available in the market, while other being it gives away the competitors information of ongoing projects. The prevalence of these leaks are apparent; however, the authenticity of these leaks is still an open problem."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "The problem of Information credibility is a multi-facets problem. There is a fragile line between a rumour and information leak. The identification of the leaked content as sensitive or not adds another dimension to the problem at hand. Rumor can be defined as a statement whose truth value is unverifiable [19]. Rumors can further be classified as misinformation and disinformation [4]. The debunking of rumours and disinformation have become one of the most pervasive problems of the decade. While the early work of rumors and misinformation focuses on hand-crafted features [2, 13, 13, 19], the later works mainly focus on the deep learning approach to misinformation identification [10, 15, 16]. The role of Twitter and other micro-blogging websites for misinformation spread has been widely studied in the literature [2, 13]. Rumor detection approaches include content-based [4] and network based features [2, 4]. Another approach also focuses on the expert knowledge in debunking of misinformation [13]. The study of rumors starts with some controversial topic [4] or trending topic [2], where the role of human in the center can't be denied.\nOne of the approaches to debunk the rumours is to identify the credibility of the source. One of the earliest definition of credibility describes it as a perceived quality composed of multiple dimensions [4]. While misinformation merely is false information, disinformation is deliberate false news [4]. The credibility assessment for topics in rumours have looked into factors including the reaction of specific topics, level of certainty of the news propagated, and whether URLs are included in the tweets [2]. In contrast to the tweets that have a limitation on the number of characters, the web-blogs and news posts don't pose any limitation to the word limit as per. While tweets have been extensively studied for rumour and stance identification, the news and blog articles for the study of rumours have been under-explored. News articles have been analyzed for effectiveness to attract clicks [3]. The headlines are related to the virality of the news article [11]. The popularity of the news article can also be co-related to sentiment polarity [3]. We believe the headlines of a blog are supposed to give a gist of the content in the article. While the headlines are supposed to be informative, the perception of news can be changed with the help of the article [7].\nWhile the credibility of the information is of significant concern, it becomes a hotbed for the leak of sensitive information. The disclosures of sensitive information have been studied with respect to organization [5, 9] as well as users [3, 14] in the past. The organizational leak of sensitive information deals with the sharing of documents from inside the organization to unintended people inside or outside the organization [5]. The authors in [5] propose security policies for the sharing of the digital documents in the organization. They believe the policy will keep a check while the files are shared. The leak of sensitive personal information have been studied with respect to users posted information [14] as well as Image sharing settings on Social Media [22]. The work in [14] propose a framework to compute the privacy score of the user, which is indicative of the potential privacy risk due to participation in the network.\nOur work contributes to the given literature in two significant ways. To the best of our knowledge, we are first to investigate information leak of the product based companies and its credibility assessment. We believe our work is a small step towards the debunking of unauthorized as well as alleged information in the public domain."}, {"title": "3 PROBLEM DEFINITION", "content": "In our work, we deal with the credibility of the web-blogs who post about Information leaks about various smartphones. We believe the leak of credible information about a product before its official unveiling is a severe concern. Section 2 throws light on the importance of headlines on the spread and popularity of news. We believe the headlines act as an opening to the web-blog where the name of the product and its features are bound to be present. Thus, we consider the headlines of the web-blogs and press-releases for our analysis.\nAssume we have a Web-blog that posts about smartphone leaks. Our objective can be divided into three parts:\n(1) Extract smartphone names from the post headline with the help of our custom NER model. (custom NER extraction)"}, {"title": "4 DATA COLLECTION AND DESCRIPTION", "content": "The sample headlines of press-releases and leak blogs can be seen in Table 3. We notice the press-release and leak blog headlines that talk about the same product show different semantic representation. In this section, we first describe the collected data and further present some preliminary analysis on this data to understand the different semantic structures of the headlines."}, {"title": "4.1 Data collection", "content": "We first describe the collected data from different blogs as well as press-releases. We collected a total of 54, 495 headlines from the press-releases as well as the leak blog headlines."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Headlines of leak web-blogs", "content": "We collect the headlines of 45, 660 posts from 6 different blogging websites dedicated to Smartphone leaks. We used Python's BeautifulSoup Library [20] to curate the headlines of leaks of a wide range of smart devices. In Table 2 we present the number of headlines collected from various web-blog sources with their average sentence length and vocabulary size. For the rest of the paper, we use the abbreviation for the web-blogs understudy as stated in the Table 2\nWe plot the number of alleged leak smartphone headlines in different web-blogs under study for two smartphone companies in Figure 1."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Headlines of official press-releases headlines", "content": "In order to identify the truth behind the leaked blog headlines, we collect 8, 835 headlines from the official press-releases of 14 websites. The press-releases headlines talk about various smartphone launches as well as other company news."}, {"title": "4.2 Preliminary Data Analysis:", "content": "In this section, we try to understand the semantics of the press-releases and blog headlines and try to investigate their format."}, {"title": "4.2.1 Sentiment Polarity", "content": "We use Vader [8] to understand how the sentiment polarity of the press-releases vary from the leak blog headlines. The mean compound sentiment score for the leak blog headlines is 0.0025 while for press-releases are 0.20. This shows that press-releases of the product tends to post more positively about a product, unlike the leaked counterparts who tend to be less positive about it. We plot the average compound sentiment of the 6 leak blog website as compared to 6 random press-release website's headlines in Figure 2. We clearly witness the average sentiment of blog and press-releases at opposite ends."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Active and Static Verb Analysis", "content": "In order to analyze how the semantic structure of leak and press-releases headlines differ we plot the frequency of usage of different verb forms in Figure 3. We witness that the use of past-participle as well as modal auxiliary verbs are more common in leak headlines, while the usage of base form of verb are more prominent in the press-releases. The use of non-3rd person singular present for both kind of sources however shows similar frequency of use. The use of past tense in verbs are also more common in leak blogs than the press-releases. The usage of past Participle verbs shows the possibility that work is already complete. While the modal auxiliary verb indicates the possibility of work going on. Thus, we believe, the leak web-blog structure their headlines mostly to talk about a developed product or the possibility of a new product in market."}, {"title": "4.2.3 Lexical Structure of Headlines", "content": "We analyze the lexical structure of the leak web-blog headlines and press-release headlines to see if they share a common format or not. The mean length of the headlines for press-releases and web-blogs are 12.84% and 12.10% respectively. The median value of the headlines for the leak web-blog is 13.0 with a standard deviation of 3.34. While the median of press-releases headlines is 11.0 with standard deviation of 4.91. The distribution of how the length of the two headlines varies is presented in Figure 4. The larger value of standard deviation for press-releases signifies that the press-releases headline posts have a bigger spread than the web-blog leaks. This shows that the press-releases of a smartphone company do not stick to a particular format while posting online; however the web-blogs have a comparatively limited format of making posts.\nCustom stop words for smartphone headlines. The headlines from both the press-releases and leak blog share a pattern in which certian words have similar likelihood of appearence. The example of such words are \"allege\", \"announce\", \"detail\", \"exclusive\",\"leak\u201d etc. Since these words do not add up to the knowledge of smartphone feature or names, we added these words to the set of stopwords. We call these stopwords as custom stopwords. We manually curate a list of 251 stopwords, of which the base form comes down to 220. We use the custom stopwords on the top of the Spacy's Stopwords [6] to remove the irrelevant keywords from the headlines when needed.\nCarbon Dating Headline URLs. In order to match the dates of the leak blogs and the press-releases, we need the date and time for each post. However, the date-time of when the web-blogs or press-releases are posted are either not available or are incomplete,"}, {"title": "5 APPROACH", "content": "In order to identify the credibility of the web-blog source, we divide the proposed architecture into three parts, as discussed in Section 3. In this Section, we look at the proposed architecture in details. First, we look into the Custom NER extraction model for evolving smartphone names."}, {"title": "5.1 Custom NER model", "content": "We witness the smartphone companies always come up with new product names. Since these smartphone names evolve with time, we found the existing NER model fails to identify all the smartphone names in the article's headline. Thus, we propose to update the present NER model that adapts to the custom Named-Entities based on the headline format of the leak blogs and press-releases headlines as shown in Figure 7.\nWe use the available NER model from Spacy [6] that provides an inbuilt statistical model for named-entity recognition. In order to train our own model on the top of Spacy, we provided the training data with Named-Entity in the format as shown in Table 4. Our training data consists of 2, 61, 995 headlines and 1, 198 smartphone names. We form the 2, 61, 995 headlines from 84 generic sentences for training our custom NER model. The Spacy NER model has support for online training of the model. We start with a blank NER model and add entity recognizer in the pipeline. We add custom entity-labels to the entity recognizer. We create 17 entity labels each corresponding to the name of the smartphone company. We run the model for 35 iterations and use active learning to update the weights if the predicted value does not match with the annotated results. In order to avoid over-fitting, we use the drop-out rate of 0.35, which have been the selected value for the drop-out rate for training NER model in Spacy. To prevent the model from generalization on the order of fed sentences, we shuffle the sentences in each of the 35 iterations. Our custom NER model took approximately 5.03 days to train on a CUDA based implementation. We show the sample headline used for training our model in Table 4. As shown in the Table 4, the first column is the sentence from which we have to extract the named-entity, while the second column is the format in which the data is fed to the model."}, {"title": "5.1.1 Efficiency of custom NER model", "content": "In this section, we describe the efficiency of our trained NER model. To calculate the accuracy of the custom NER model, we use Jaccard similarity and Cosine similarity metrics and compare the result of the custom NER model with the annotated smartphone names. We also compare the results of the similarity metrics to see which similarity metric gives the best result. We hypothesize the similarity metrics may perform differently for different leak blogs, given the way to form sentences may differ from blog to blog. We use inter-annotation agreement to get the average value of similarity score for different similarity metric. The result of different similarity metrics are shown in Table 5.\nJaccard Similarity: We use Jaccard Similarity as a metric to find out the intersection versus union of the predicted NER and the annotated NER values. In order to find accurate result, we lemmatize the words before we calculate the Jaccard Score. The result of the Jaccard Similarity for the custom NER is given in Table 5."}, {"title": "5.2 NER based binning", "content": "After we have identified the named-entity in the headlines, we group all the headlines based on the predicted smartphone names. Further, we use the datetime of release as a metric to identify whether the datetime of official press-release preceded alleged leak datetime or not. The t and f used in Equation 3, are thus updated on the basis of results. The t and f can have values 0 or 1, where the default values are taken as 0. If the leaked headline's datetime precedes official press-release headline, the t value is incremented or else f value is incremented."}, {"title": "5.3 Credibility Score for web-blogs", "content": "After we have identified the truth behind the alleged leak, we update the score of the leak blog in our system. The default credibility score of any web-blog is taken as 0. Any value greater that 0 will indicate towards source being authentic leak provider, while any score less would indicate the leak blog websites make inauthentic claims or rumors. The goal here is to identify the credible sources who post information leak. The advantage of identifying the credibility of the web-blog source is two-fold. Firstly, further action can be taken on these web-blog sources by the respective companies in order to tackle the leaks of their smartphones. The second advantage is that the common consumers of the such news blogs can be benefited as they can rest assured the news of leak is not hoax."}, {"title": "6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "content": "In this section, we describe the results obtained from the proposed approach in details. For further analysis, we consider one of the web-blog source who actively post about smartphone leaks. Given that the official press-release of the products of all companies are hard to get, for our experiments, we consider the press-releases and corresponding leak of one of the smartphone companies. We compare the press-releases and leaks of Samsung for the credibility score of the Web-blog. The Experiments are divided into steps mentioned below:\n(1) We first evaluate the accuracy of the custom NER model with help of different similarity metrics for the given web-blog.\n(2) We bin the press-release and leak blog headlines that talk about the same product using similarity metrics.\n(3) We identify the time-line of a given product release in the public domain for both press-release and leak and identify whether the first appearance is leak or not.\n(4) We evaluate the percentage of leaks by a given leak blog website and calculate the credibility score for it.\nWe use AP as our test case for further analysis. The further procedure are described in details as given below:\nStep I: Identify number of smartphones talked about based on custom NER:\nIn order to identify the credibility of AP, we first analyze the number of product-wise leak of different smartphones in the web-blog as compared to the press-releases. We run our custom NER model to group all the headlines in AP according to predicted smartphone names. We then map the group with their respective press-release headline. We plot the number of headlines for different Samsung smartphones in the blog AP as well as in press-releases in the Figure 8. In our collected dataset, we witness the number of press-releases posts for all the smartphones is much more than the posts made by web-blog AP. While S7 is the most posted about product in both press-releases and web-blogs the number of posts for leak and press-releases differ massively for S5.\nStep II: Group the alleged leak headlines with P.R: After we have the identified the smartphone names talked about in AP, we bin all the headlines for a given smartphone together w.r.t both AP and Samsung press-releases. We finally sort the headlines based on the date and time obtained from the carbon-dating of URLs. We present press-release as well as the first online appearance of sample smartphones in the Table 6\nStep III: Create timeline for product and give credibility score:"}, {"title": "7 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this work, we address the problem of identification of the credibility of the web-blog source who post about the leak of the smartphones. We consider the leak of a smartphone as the post of a smartphone in the public domain before its official press-release. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold: (1) We argue that the semantics of leak headlines are inherently different from the press-release headlines. (2) We identify the truth behind the alleged leak with the help of the first appearance of the URLs of the headlines on the web. (3) Based on the number of actual leaks by a web-log, we give the web-blog credibility score, which helps to identify whether the web-blog share legitimate leak information or not. We first collect the headlines of the web-blogs that talk about smartphone leaks. We then collect the press-releases of the smartphones from the official archive page. In order to identify the ever-evolving smartphone names, we train our custom NER model on the top of the Spacy. We manually annotate the headlines of the web-blog and present the accuracy of the custom NER model through various similarity metrics. We achieve the accuracy of 82.14% on our custom NER model. In the next step, we group the headlines based on the NER and identify the created date and time of the leaked web-blog are before or after the press-release to identify the legitimate leaks. We propose a credibility score metric based on the number of smartphones the web-blog talk about and the number of identified leaks to give credibility score to the web-blog.\nWe believe the credibility assessment of the web-blog is useful in two significant ways. Firstly, it can help the smartphone producing companies to identify the web-blogs who claim to have posted leaks. Secondly, it can help the users to identify legitimate sources for new information on smartphone leaks. We believe the leak of a smartphone is a severe issue and steps need to be taken for the identification of the alleged leaks. As a future work, we wish to extend the experiment of credibility assessment on all the blog sources under study and produce a comparative analysis of the same. We further wish to improve the accuracy of the NER model to produce better results. We also wish to deploy a live web-blog credibility assessment system for the work done in this paper."}, {"title": null, "content": "where $t_{estimated}$ is the first arrival time of the URL on the web and $t_{method}$ is the list of all the estimated times pulled out from various sources."}, {"title": null, "content": "$K = \\frac{Pr(a) - Pr(e)}{1- Pr(e)}$"}, {"title": null, "content": "$f = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (t-2 * f)$"}]}

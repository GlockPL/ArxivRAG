It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information process-ing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and band-width. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and compu-tation.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Across the boundaries of fifth-generation wireless technology (5G), the next generation of wireless communications, 6G, is expected to go far beyond conventional communications of connected people and things to connected intelligence or intel-ligence of everything [1], [2], [3], [4]. As announced by IMT-2030, three additional usage scenarios of integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communications, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and ubiquitous connectivity, will be fostered in 6G, as well as three enhanced usage scenarios, i.e., immersive communication, massive communication, and hyper reliable and low-latency communication, which evolve from the scenarios of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in 5G [5]. \u03a4\u03bf facilitate the implementation of these scenarios, higher key performance indicators (KPIs) are designed in 6G [4], [6]. For example, the user-experienced data rate should achieve 1 Gbit/s and the connection density should be 107 devices/km\u00b2.\nFig. 1 depicts the evolution of KPIs and usage scenarios. To achieve these KPIs, novel theories and techniques such as electromagnetic information theory [7], semantic commu-nications [8], edge AI [9], and near-field communications [10], are developed. Moreover, the realization of connected intelligence demands the implementation of massive intelligent applications at the network edge such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, remote health care, and industrial automation [9]. These applications call for the fusion of physical, biological, and cyber worlds, which naturally involves three modules, including sensing the environment for obtaining information, communication between different entities for information shar-ing, and computation on devices and servers for processing the information and making intelligent decisions [11]. This gives rise to a brand-new research area called integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC). In the sequel, the related partial integration technologies are first introduced, followed by the discussion of the motivations and challenges of ISCC.\nA. Technologies of Partial Integration\n1) Integrated Communication and Computation: Integrated communication and computation (ICC) refers to the joint de-sign of communication and computation processes in tasks by allowing resource allocation between them to improve the sys-tem performance under a unified goal, such as energy/latency minimization and computation accuracy maximization. Since a dozen years ago, researchers in the wireless communication field have made efforts to develop ICC techniques at the network edge. Initially, mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed, which aims at offloading partial or full on-device tasks to edge servers for enhancing the system performance e.g., energy efficiency and latency, via balancing the on-device communication and computation loads [12]. Building"}, {"title": "II. INTEGRATED COMMUNICATION AND COMPUTATION", "content": "Emerging intelligent services over wireless networks often encompass both communication and computation processes. In conventional wireless networks, the communication and computation processes are separately designed. For instance, service tasks are typically executed at a central server with high computing and storage capabilities, where the central server first collects the data from geographically dispersed devices for task-related computation and then feeds back the computation results to corresponding devices for fulfilling the service requirements. With the proliferation of wirelessly connected devices, the communication burden of bandwidth-limited wireless networks significantly increases and the com-putation burden of the central server is also augmented due to massive volumes of data to be processed, making it inefficient to handle diverse service requirements in a centralized man-ner. Such a separate design ignores the inherent connection between the transmitted data and subsequent service tasks, leading to inefficient resource utilization and in turn degrading the system performance.\nBy treating the communication and computation processes as a unified module, ICC emerges as a promising technique to enhance the system performance, where the allocation of com-munication and computation resources are jointly optimized to achieve a common objective, e.g., energy/delay minimization and computation accuracy maximization, thereby making full use of limited resources to improve the system performance. In this section, we provide an overview of the existing studies on ICC, focusing on the efficient design of joint communica-tion and computation, which is illustrated by presenting two promising examples, e.g., MEC and AirComp, as shown in Fig. 2 and listed below.\n\u2022 Mobile Edge Computing: MEC intends to move the data transmission and processing operations to the network edge by exploiting the computing power and storage capabilities of edge servers and distributed devices, while the communication resources can be utilized to exchange for the computation resources via task offloading, thereby enabling ICC with joint communication and computation resource allocation.\n\u2022 Over-the-Air Computation: AirComp aims at efficiently computing a target function by exploiting the co-channel interference, where the simultaneously transmitted signals can be naturally added over the air to realize a function computation during the communication process, thereby achieving ICC by exploiting the waveform superposition of concurrently transmitted signals.\nB. Mobile Edge Computing\nIn the past few years, computation tasks over wireless networks have been typically accomplished by resorting to cloud computing, which requires the large amount of data generated by devices to be collected and transmitted to a cen-tralized server with high storage and computing capabilities, so as to perform data analysis and computation for meeting various requirements of different devices. However, with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT), the number of connected devices dramatically increases, leading to a severe communication burden of the wireless network and high computing pressure of the central server. Therefore, due to limited radio resources, cloud computing is no longer suitable for latency-sensitive services with massive connectivities in future wireless networks. To address the above issues, MEC is emerging as a new computing paradigm thanks to the advancement of microchip computing power, which enables the edge server and mobile devices to execute computing tasks with their own computing and storage capabilities at the network edge [12].\nA typical MEC system consists of edge servers and mobile devices, where edge servers are generally co-located with access points (APs) and deployed in proximity to mobile devices. Herein, the mobile devices are allowed to offload the computational tasks to edge servers for executing the tasks with high computing pressure and low latency require-ments. To unleash the potential of MEC, numerous studies have explored task offloading design in MEC systems with single/multiple edge server(s) and multiple users. Specifically, the system design of MEC lies in the following aspects."}, {"title": "III. INTEGRATED SENSING AND COMPUTATION", "content": "In this section, we provide a comprehensive survey about the technologies for both sensing signals acquisition and the corresponding processing methods for completing sensing tasks, giving its name ISC. As shown in Fig. 3, there are three ISC technologies. The first one is wireless sensing (also called radar sensing) technology, which senses a target by re-ceiving and processing the echo signal of a carefully designed waveform. Yet, information obtained from a single modality of sensing signals may not be sufficient for completing com-plicated tasks [111]. It is mathematically shown in [30] that collecting multi-modal sensory data can provide better sensing performance. Therefore, the second ISC technology of multi-modal sensing is developed. Moreover, although multi-modal sensing technology can enjoy many benefits of rich infor-mation, high robustness, cross-modality data transformation, it requires deploying dedicated sensors, which is expensive. To empower ubiquitous sensing in a large coverage with low cost, the third ISC technology called mobile crowdsensing, is proposed [33]. It utilizes built-in sensors of ubiquitous mobile devices for collecting sensory data in various domains. In the sequel, the above three ISC technologies are discussed.\nB. Wireless Sensing Technology\nWireless sensing, which is also called radar sensing, emits modulated radio waves, receives and processes the correspond-ing echo signals to complete computation tasks such as object ranging and detection, and motion recognition. Its application can be traced back to the usage of radar in the early 20th century. Because of its significant military value, radar ushered tremendous development during World War II and turned to be a key technique for empowering many major and intelligent applications, including military surveillance, remote sensing in space, and auto-driving. Based on the original continuous-wave radar, new techniques in terms of wave-form design, signal processing, and system architecture are developed to enhance its abilities regarding velocity, distance, direction, and sensitivity toward motions. In this part, the development of radar system design and the corresponding signal processing are introduced.\n1) Radar Waveform Design and Signal Processing: Aiming at achieving higher accuracy of the ranging and detection results, one key advancement of radar techniques is the de-velopment of waveform design and the corresponding signal processing approaches [55]. In this part, we will introduce the evolution of the waveform design from the initial continuous wave to the state-of-the-art designs.\n\u2022 Traditional Continuous-wave Radar: As its name sug-gests, traditional continuous-wave radar continuously transmits a waveform with a stable frequency and re-ceives an echo signal from one or more targets. To detect the Doppler shift of the received echo signal, a conjugate mixing method is utilized. To be specific, both the transmit signal and the echo signal are sampled with a time interval T and then transformed into the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). By calculating the cross-correlation of the two signals and applying a low-pass filter, the frequency difference of the two signals, i.e., the Doppler frequency shift (DFS), can be extracted. Based on the DFS, the velocity can be estimated. The resolution (or the detection error) of the velocity is proportional to the sampling rate $\\frac{1}{T}$. However, the measurement of range information i.e., distance of the target which is decided by light speed and the round-trip delay, is not available with continuous waveform. The reason is that the round-trip delay is detected by the phase shift of the echo signal, which is ambiguous to the receiver due to the lack of phase basis. That's to say, we cannot distinguish the phase shifts $0$ and $(0 + 2\u03ba\u03c0)$ with k being any integers.\n\u2022 Pulsed Wave Radar: To obtain the range information, the pulsed radar is developed, where the transmit waveform is generated by modulating a single-frequency signal by a periodic window signal with period T. That's to say, the transmitter periodically produces a brief pulse of radio signal and keeps silent to receive the echo signal of the detected object. The interval between two consecutive pulses is called the inter-pulse period (IPP). The range information is detected by processing the echo signal within one transmission period, called fast-time processing. Specifically, with the time basis of the transmit signal, the exact phase shift of the two signals can be detected using their correlation in the frequency domain. Subsequently, the round-trip delay is calculated and is further used to compute the distance. It should be emphasized that IPP should be larger than the round-trip delay to make sure the echo signal of one pulse can be correctly received. The resolution of rang information is proportional to the pulse transmission period T. The velocity is detected using multiple pulses, called slow-time processing. With a fixed velocity, the DFS of each signal in several consecutive pulse waveforms is a single-frequency signal. Hence, by calculating the correlation of the echo signal and the transmit signal over a long time scale (i.e., over multiple transmission periods) in the frequency domain, the DFS is detected and the corresponding velocity can be calculated. The resolution of the detected DFS or velocity is proportional to $1/T$. Note that there is a tradeoff between the resolutions of range and velocity information.\n\u2022 Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) Radar: The time efficiency of pulsed wave radar is relatively low due to the intermittent transmission. To this end, an advanced FMCW radar is developed. The sensing signal is decomposed of multiple repeated snapshots. In each snapshot, a continuous waveform is transmitted with the frequency modulated as a linear function of time. Although transmitting and receiving work simultaneously, no interference is caused as they have different frequen-cies. Similar to pulsed radar, the range information is detected via fast-time processing, and the velocity is detected by slow-time processing using M snapshots, but the time efficiency of FMCW is higher compared to pulsed radar due to continuous transmission. The resolutions of range and velocity are proportional to the snapshot duration and the number of used snapshots M, respectively."}, {"title": "IV. INTEGRATED SENSING AND COMMUNICATION", "content": "ISAC has been a promising technique in wireless networks for saving network resources and enhancing the performance of both sensing and communication. Different from exist-ing literature (e.g., [29], [209], [36]) focusing on integrated wireless sensing and communication, a comprehensive survey about ISAC is provided in this work. Specifically, three ISAC paradigms will be presented which align the three ISC technologies in Section III, as shown in III and listed below.\n\u2022 Integrated Wireless Sensing and Communication: This paradigm enables hardware and radio resources shar-ing between wireless sensing and communication. The general integrated wireless (radar) sensing and com-munication technique is first elaborated, including two frameworks of radar communication coexistence (RCC) and dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) [209]. Then, a special case of Wi-Fi sensing is discussed, since WiFi signals are widely distributed and can be used for sensing at low cost.\n\u2022 Integrated Multi-modal Sensing and Communication: Uti-lization of only uni-modal electromagnetic wave for ISAC cannot provide complete and fine-grained char-acteristics of both sensing target and wireless channels [38]. This motivates the emergence of integrated multi-modal sensing and communication. In this work, three key techniques are introduced, i.e., dataset construction, multi-modal sensing for channel estimation, and commu-nication for multi-modal sensing enhancement.\n\u2022 Integrated Mobile Crowdsensing and Communication: The current research focus on this topic lies in using existing communication techniques for collecting massive distributed sensory data to a central server for completing the downstream tasks. The integration of crowdsensing and communication from a systematic view remains an unexplored area.\nB. Integrated Wireless Sensing and Communication\n1) General Integrated Wireless Sensing and Communica-tion: With the explosion of mobile traffic, the available frequency bands for communication are crowded, which drives an urgent demand for more spectrum resources. One promising solution is to reuse the wide radar spectrum [210], giving rise to an emerging research topic i.e., integrated wireless sensing and communication [29]. On the other hand, many radar sensors are deployed for significant applications like air traffic control, geophysical monitoring, surveillance for defense, etc. The rising interference from wireless communication systems should be well managed and suppressed. To tackle these issues caused by communication and radar spectrum sharing, two frameworks are widely investigated, namely, RCC and DFRC [209]. The former aims to develop efficient interference-suppression techniques so that the two systems can coexist without interference. The latter focuses on designing systems that can simultaneously realize wireless communication and remote sensing. In the sequel, the techniques for empowering these two frameworks are elaborated.\nThe main issue in an RCC system is to avoid interference between radar and communication. Recent research starts from designing opportunistic spectrum access and interference management or cancellation schemes based on interference channel state information (ICSI) estimation. Similar to cog-nitive radio, radar is regarded as the primary user and the communication system plays the role of the secondary user. To be specific, a communication transceiver intelligently detects whether a communication channel is in use or not and moves transmission into vacant channels. This makes better use of spectrum resources and enhances the frequency efficiency. To avoid the possible performance degradation of radar caused by co-channel interference, the communication system should control its transmit power [211]. Although it is simple to implement opportunistic spectrum access schemes with low cost, there is no real spectrum sharing between radar and communication. Besides, such schemes cannot facilitate the"}, {"title": "V. SIGNAL DESIGN FOR ISCC", "content": "The above partial-integration techniques, i.e., ISC, ICC, and ISAC, fall short in three aspects as mentioned in Section I-B, i.e., low resource utilization caused by partial integration, mismatch between goals of the overall task and each module caused by separate designs, and ignoring the tight coupling of different modules. To overcome these shortages for improving system performance, ISCC designs are desirable.\nTo support ISCC, the signal designs have been investigated including the beamforming and waveform designs. Specifi-cally, the waveforms need to be designed to balance the radar sensing performance evaluated by CRB, the communication performance evaluated by SNR, and the computation per-formance evaluated by AirComp mean-squared-error (MSE) between the aggregated data and the ground truth. The beam-forming designs are further required to equalize the channels among mobile devices and suppress noise to improve the ISCC performance.\nIn the physical layer, ISCC can be categorized into three types as shown in Fig. 6. The first type designs independent signals dedicated for sensing, communication, and computa-tion functionalities, which is known as the single-functional signal design. However, the dedicated signals cause severe interference among different functionalities. To reduce the interference, the second type designs one signal for sensing and another for AirComp, which is defined as the dual-functional signal design. As a further step, the third type namely the triple-functional signal design realizes sensing, communication, and computation in one signal, which trades increased design complexity for interference cancellation. The technical details are elaborated as follows.\nB. Single-Functional Signal Design\nIn [86], the independent communication signals and com-putation signals are transmitted simultaneously from mul-tiple multi-antenna mobile devices (MDs), while the data is assumed to be sensed by the MDs. The communication signals are received by the server to recover the data with the existence of interference and channel noise, where the per-formance is evaluated by the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). As for computation, The signals are superposed during the transmission and aggregated at the server, where the performance is evaluated by the MSE between the aggregated data and the ground truth. To improve the communication throughput and reduce the computation error, the transmit and receive beamforming designs for communication and computation are jointly designed. However, the neglect of the sensing process makes it less possible to be implemented in practice.\nBy taking the sensing process into consideration, the dedi-cated signals for sensing, communication, and computation are transmitted simultaneously from multiple single-antenna MDs in [282]. The sensing signals are reflected by the targets and then received by the server, based on which the information of targets is estimated. The performance of sensing is evaluated by the MSE between the estimated target information and the"}, {"title": "VI. NETWORK RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR ISCC", "content": "Apart from signal designs for ISCC, another main research stream of ISCC aims to enhance the network resource utility via resources (e.g., time, bandwidth, and energy) sharing. As shown in Fig. 7, there are two ISCC resource allocation paradigms. One paradigm is joint RRM for task coexistence, which allows the coexistence of sensing, communication, and computation tasks, leading to loose coupling among the three modules as shown in Fig. 7(a). In this paradigm, each task has its own goal. Dynamic network resource allocation among different tasks can be conducted to achieve multiple goals (e.g., communication capacity, computation accuracy, and sensing SNR) simultaneously. The other paradigm is task-oriented ISCC resource allocation for complicated tasks that involve sensing for information acquisition, computation for informa-tion processing, and communication for information transmis-sion. In these tasks, the three modules are tightly coupled as shown in Fig. 7(b). The reasons are as follows. On one hand, the overall task performance depends on the qualities of the three modules, e.g., the sensing and communication SNR, the computation latency, and the quantization error. However, they should compete for resources to enhance their own qualities. On the other hand, there is tight dependency among them in general. For example, the size of the obtained sensory data decides the computation load, while the size of on-device computational results further determines the communication load. In the sequel, the above two paradigms are elaborated.\nB. Joint RRM for Task Coexistence\nIn this paradigm, sensing, communication, and computation tasks coexist and network resources are jointly and adaptively allocated among them to achieve multiple goals at the same time. In general, sensing and communication tasks are exe-cuted in physical layers, while computation tasks are realized in upper layers by e.g., MEC. In this paradigm, each type of task adopts its traditional performance metric. As an example, in [288], the sensing performance is measured by the mutual information (MI), the communication task aims to achieve a higher transmission rate, and the computation performance is evaluated by the processing delay. In the following, three typical example cases of this paradigm are discussed, i.e., the coexistence of sensing, communication, and computation tasks, the coexistence of sensing and MEC tasks, and the coexistence of ISC and MEC tasks.\n1) Coexistence of Sensing, Communication, and Computa-tion Tasks: In this case, sensing, communication, and com-putation tasks coexist and compete for network resources to achieve their own targets. Particularly, in [288], ISAC serves as a supporting technique to allow hardware and spectrum sharing between the communication and the sensing tasks. A Cobb-Douglas utility function that combines three metrics, i.e., sensing precision, communication capacity, and computation capability, is adopted and maximized by the joint design of device association and sub-channel assignment. Besides, the authors in [289] investigate a time-division multiplexing ISCC system, where FMCW is used as the sensing wave-form and orthogonal time slots are assigned to the sensing, uplink/downlink communication, and computation processes. Targeting communication capacity maximization and compu-tation offloading latency minimization while guaranteeing the sensing distortion is under a limited threshold, a joint resource allocation, time partitioning scheme, computation task pro-cessing mode selection, and target sensing location selection, are proposed. In [290], the IRS is applied to assist the ISAC and computation task offloading, where both partial offloading and binary offloading are considered. A performance metric called weighted throughput capacity, which comprises the radar sensing capacity, communication throughput, and com-putation throughput, is proposed and maximized via joint beamforming design and time allocation. Furthermore, in [28], the ISCC framework is designed for intelligent machine-type communication (IMTC) networks to achieve highly reliable communication with low latency, highly accurate sensing, and fast data processing. In IMTC, intelligent machines (IMs) are expected to execute complex data processing tasks in rapidly varying environments, which demands IMs to conduct real-time environmental sensing and cooperation with each other [291]. To this end, a closed-loop is formulated where the sensed data is exploited as a priori information to improve the communication performance, the communication techniques are designed to support the intelligent computation, and the computation results in turn facilitate the ISAC process.\n2) Coexistence of Sensing and MEC Tasks: In this case, the sensing and the MEC tasks compete for radio resources to achieve their respective goals. ISAC technique is used to enable hardware and radio resource sharing between sensing and communication. In [88], a UAV-supported ISCC frame-work is proposed, where a treble-functional UAV senses a target by using the unified beam waves, processes sensory data locally, and offloads its computational tasks to ground APs. By characterizing the Pareto boundary between the sensing beampattern gain and the computation capacity, a fundamental trade-off is revealed. Specifically, by applying the semidefinite programming method and the concave-convex procedure tech-nique, a joint optimization algorithm is proposed and depicts the performance region, as well as enhancing the ability of sensing, computing, and communication of UAVs. Besides, an architecture that integrates communication, radar sensing, and MEC, is developed in [292], where user terminals conduct computation offloading and radar sensing over the same radio resource blocks by using DFRC techniques and MIMO arrays. To jointly optimize the performance of MIMO radar beam-"}, {"title": "VII. ISCC IN FUTURE ADVANCED NETWORKS", "content": "In this section, the potential ISCC techniques for deploying digital twin platforms at the network edge and the potential ISCC applications in two future advanced networks, i.e., the computing power networks and the SAGINs, are discussed.\nA. ISCC for Digital Twin Enabled Wireless Networks\nA digital twin system refers to constructing virtual or digital representations of the physical objects and systems via the techniques of high-quality distributed sensing, precise 3D map construction, real-time tracing, deep machine learning, and so on [299]. It targets generating simulation data that cannot be distinguished from its real-world counterparts, conducts data analysis, and makes decisions based on the generated data [300]. Digital twins have been widely used in many areas e.g., intelligent manufacturing, climate change, healthcare, and economic crises [300]. Particularly, since digital twins have a powerful ability to simulate complex wireless environments, it has attracted more and more attention to deploy digital twins at the network edge for addressing many issues including network complexity control [301], network performance en-hancement [302], disruptions prediction and prevention [303], network topology visualization [304], and supporting MEC and industrial IoT networks [299].\nHowever, establishing a digital twin network is challenging. It desires massive sensory data of multiple modalities for acquiring ground-true information of real wireless networks, high communication throughput for transmitting sensory data or the corresponding extracted information, and powerful com-putation capability for data generation, analytics, and decision-making. To tackle these challenges, an ISCC-based digital twin network is proposed as shown in Fig. 8, where many sensors of different types are deployed for perceiving a real wireless network to obtain ground-true information, and the digital twin system is deployed at an edge server for executing all complex and computation-intensive algorithms to construct the virtual representation. Based on such a digital twin network, two ISCC techniques are discussed. One is a hybrid learning platform for training AI models that are used for constructing digital twin systems. The other is a real-time ISCC technique to leverage the established digital twin for making accurate and fast decisions.\n1) Hybrid AI Training Based Digital Twin Network Con-struction: One significant step for establishing the digital twin network in Fig.8 is training many AI models for accomplishing many intelligent tasks, by using a large amount of multi-modal sensory data from many distributed sensors.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides healthcare to over 80 million low-income Americans, including pregnant women, children, and individuals with disabilities. Up against a host of problems, including rising healthcare costs, disparity in access, and the management of chronic conditions among at-risk groups, Medicaid is one of the biggest healthcare payers in the U.S. Just as Medicare does, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a major opportunity to change the delivery of care and operational efficiency in Medicaid [1] [16].\nWhile there has been extensive conversation about AI in Medicare, the unique population and requirements of Medicaid require customized AI applications [1]. Chronic disease management, improving admin tasks, and a reduction in costs are amongst the ways AI tools can help, especially by focusing on social determinants of health (SDOH) that are important for Medicaid populations. The study will assess the ability of AI-enabled systems to reinforce Medicaid in handling its particular challenges while facilitating fair and quality care for its entire population of beneficiaries [8] [9]."}, {"title": "2. AI APPLICATIONS IN MEDICAID", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1. Predictive Analytics in the Management of Population Health", "content": "Medicaid beneficiaries often experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and mental health conditions\u2014that need proper care management. AI application predictive analytics helps recognize patients at greater threat of poor health results, determined by the patterns identified in healthcare utilization, social determinants, and medical histories [2]. Thanks to this method, responses are brisk, and preventive measures yield fewer hospital visits and better health accomplishments. We have discussed the AI application and respective benefits in Medicaid in Table 1.\nFor instance, machine learning models could allow Medicaid to spot patients at risk of missing their appointments or failing to stick to treatment plans, and deliver real-time alerts for further care [6]. States like Texas and California will see a direct result as they have high Medicaid enrollment but access to regular health care tends to be challenging [16]."}, {"title": "2.2 AI-Powered Fraud Detection and Billing Optimization", "content": "Medicaid's enormous spread makes susceptible risk for fraud, waste, and abuse. Through real-time analysis of rich datasets by AI, a more efficient fraud claim detection along with improper billing is achievable.

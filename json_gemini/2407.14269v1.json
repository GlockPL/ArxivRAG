Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, current automated simultaneous interpretation systems still struggle to match the flexibility and adaptability of human interpreters. This paper proposes a paradigm shift in approach, directly utilizing the predictive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a more dynamic and context-aware simultaneous interpretation system.\nRecent developments in LLMs, such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), have demonstrated remarkable abilities in language understanding and generation. However, their application in simultaneous interpretation has been limited, primarily using them as translation engines rather than leveraging their predictive capabilities. Our research builds upon and significantly extends the work of Zheng et al. (2020), who explored the use of GPT-2 for simultaneous translation.\nWe propose an algorithm that not only predicts the speaker's next words but also generates and maintains multiple possible translation paths simultaneously. This approach allows for rapid adaptation to changes in speaker intent or subject matter, a capability that has been a significant challenge for existing systems (Ma et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "2 Methodology:", "content": "Our proposed algorithm consists of five key steps:\n1. Context Acquisition: Pre-loading the LLM with relevant contextual information to enhance prediction accuracy.\n2. Real-time Transcription: Converting the speaker's speech into text using advanced speech recognition techniques.\n3. Next Word Prediction and Tree Construction: Using the LLM to predict multiple possible continuations of the speaker's utterance, forming a tree-like structure of potential translations.\n4. Partial Translation Confirmation: Confirming and storing partial translations in the target language as soon as they can be determined with high confidence.\n5. Comparison and Output: Comparing predictions with actual speech and outputting confirmed translations in the target language.\nThis methodology expands on the incremental translation concept introduced by Oda et al. (2014) and the diverse translation candidate generation proposed by Xu and Carpuat (2021). However, our approach is novel in its application of these concepts in a real-time, LLM-driven system."}, {"title": "3 Detailed Explanation of Key Steps:", "content": "To illustrate the core functionality of our system, we will focus on Steps 3, 4, and 5, using a representative example:\nStep 3: Next Word Prediction and Tree Construction\nIn this step, the system generates a prediction tree based on the current input. Consider the following Japanese input:\n\u300c\u79c1\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u3001\u53cb\u9054\u3068...\u300d(Watashi wa kin\u014d, tomodachi to...)\nThe system might generate the following prediction tree:\n\u300c\u6620\u753b\u3092\u898b\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u300d(Eiga wo mi ni itta) - \"went to see a movie\" (Probability: 40%)\n\u300c\u98df\u4e8b\u3092\u3057\u305f\u300d(Shokuji wo shita) \"had a meal\" (Probability: 30%)\n\u300c\u516c\u5712\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u300d(K\u014den ni itta) - \"went to the park\" (Probability: 20%)\n- Other possibilities (Probability: 10%)\nStep 4: Partial Translation Confirmation\nBased on the input and predictions, the system can confidently translate the beginning of the sentence:\nConfirmed partial translation: \"Yesterday, I ... with my friend\"\nThe system holds this partial translation in memory while waiting for the sentence to complete.\nStep 5: Comparison and Output\nLet's assume the actual complete utterance is:\n\u300c\u79c1\u306f\u6628\u65e5\u3001\u53cb\u9054\u3068\u8cb7\u3044\u7269\u306b\u884c\u3063\u305f\u300d(Watashi wa kin\u014d, tomodachi to kaimono ni itta)\n\"Yesterday, I went shopping with my friend\"\nThe system compares this with the predictions:\n1. None of the high-probability predictions match exactly.\n2. The actual ending (\"went shopping\") falls under the \"Other possibilities\" category.\n3. The system adapts by selecting the \"Other\" path and generating the appropriate translation.\nFinal output: \"Yesterday, I went shopping with my friend.\"\nThis example demonstrates the system's ability to:\n1. Generate partial translations quickly for improved real-time performance.\n2. Handle unexpected utterances by maintaining multiple prediction paths.\n3. Adapt swiftly when the actual speech diverges from high-probability predictions."}, {"title": "4 Theoretical Analysis:", "content": "The core innovation of our approach lies in its direct utilization of LLM's predictive capabilities.

Error Detection and Recovery:\na) Mismatched Predictions: When the actual speech diverges significantly from all predicted paths.\nSolution: Implement a confidence threshold. If all predictions fall below this threshold, trigger a rapid re-prediction process using the most recent context.\nb) Contextual Errors: When the system misinterprets the overall context of the conversation.\nSolution: Periodically re-evaluate the broader context using a separate LLM module. If a contextual shift is detected, update the main translation model accordingly.\nc) Language-Specific Errors: Mistakes arising from idiomatic expressions or culture-specific references.\nSolution: Incorporate a database of common idioms and cultural references, flagging potential misinterpretations for special handling.\nd) Technical Failures: Such as temporary loss of audio input or system lag.\nSolution: Implement a robust buffering system that can temporarily store audio input.

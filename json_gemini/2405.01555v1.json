INTRODUCTION", "content": "The increasing demand for surveillance and remote sensing in disasters or remote environments, such as maritime areas, deserts, and dense forests, necessitates revolutionary solutions. Implementing mobile services and running intelligent applications on mobile edge devices (MEDs), like mobile phones, unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), offers such a revolutionary approach [1, 2]. Nevertheless, the computing and communication capacity of a MED is still not comparable with that of the CPU or GPU mounted on the static ground base station [3, 4]. Admittedly, there are still some deficiencies to be tackled, i.e., the location limitations of the BS and the high deployment cost. Owing to the flexible deployment and low price of aerial crafts, such as UAVs, airships or balloons [5, 6], the aircraft as mobile edge computing (MEC) devices has emerged as a key role for providing computing power services to users.\nSeveral studies have been dedicated to aircraft-assisted MED for aerial mobile edge services, such as task offloading [7, 8]. The researchers mainly focus on reducing computing delay and energy consumption. However, since computing, cache, bandwidth, and other resources of the aircraft serving dynamic task offloading requests are unevenly distributed among multiple aircrafts, mutual exclusion problems in limited resource can easily arise. The existing research primarily solves the problems by using artificial intelligence (AI) and game theory. The AI algorithms train deep neural networks to provide near-optimal policies for task offloading, while the intelligent algorithms lack interpretability and generalization. The game theory converts the interaction of multiple aircrafts into a game, and the mutual exclusion problem is resolved by utilizing equilibrium conditions of the game, i.e., encouraging resource cooperation among aircrafts.\nIn order to better introduce the motivation of this paper, we summarize existing task execution methods into the following four categories. An example in Fig. 1 is given below to illustrate the challenges that existing multi-UAV systems deal with task offloading. In Fig. 1 a), tasks are offloaded to UAVs randomly or selectively without considering the UAVs' actual computing, storage, and communication resources. This often results in poor task offloading service quality and inefficient resource utilization due to resource shortages or surpluses.Fig. 1 b) illustrates the use of the equilibrium method among multi-UAV providing one-to-one offloading services. Each UAV provides task offloading services independently, requiring careful evaluation of the inter-UAV relationships. However, this method leads to unjust resource distribution and, subsequently, lower task offloading service quality. Fig. 1 c) shows a scenario where all UAVs cooperate with each other to form a multi-UAV system to provide all-to-one task offloading services. The approach enhances the quality of task offloading services, it can also lead to underutilization of UAV resources. In contrast, Fig. 1 d) differs from Fig. 1 c) by simultaneously considering task offloading service requests and resource cooperation. Multiple UAVs unite to form a team with the aim of providing many-to-one task offloading services while maximizing overall utility. This method excels in optimizing both resource utilization and task offloading service quality. We clearly see that the method described in Fig. 1 d) is more in line with actual needs. However, the UAV-assisted MED also faces new challenges, i.e., the long line-of-sight link between the user and the UAV will cause a long transmission latency, and the computing resources at the UAV are not always adequate, which are not friendly to delay-sensitive tasks [9]. Although some excellent work has demonstrated that device-to-device task offloading can be used to ensure low latency and high data transmission rate [10\u201312], the mobility and service requirements of user and the unpredictability of UAV resources in the real world have not yet been fully considered.\nFortuitously, the emergence of digital twin (DT) technology enabled the cooperation and information exchange between the physical object and virtual entity [13]. DT not only generates virtual models representing physical objects within the network but also maintains real-time monitoring of the network's status. This enables the direct provisioning of facilitating more accurate and timely offloading decisions to users, aligning with the evolving needs of intelligent systems [14]. Recognizing the advantages of DT, recent researches have combined DT and MEC to establish an aerial MEC network that collects data from diverse physical entities and stores the data in a dedicated device while simultaneously conducting monitoring of the current network's status. On the other hand, the generative model (GM) provides an exciting perspective for intention-based resource cooperation strategy, where we can encode the intention into the conditioning information and explicitly guide the generation of cooperation strategy (i.e., request-strategy-utility sequences that represent the decision-making process) with flexible combination of multiple task constraints.\nInspired by the motivation and the emerging technique, this paper considers DT-empowered task assignment with resource coalition cooperation in an aerial MEC network consisting of multiple users, UAVs equipped with edge servers, and an airship equipped with a more powerful cloud server, where the users randomly generate tasks as they move. In this case, our goal is to reduce energy consumption by jointly optimizing the task assignment, energy consumption, communication bandwidth, and the resource utilization. For the sake of clarity, the main contributions of this work are listed as follows\n\u2022 We propose an DT-empowered aerial MEC system framework for task assignment based on resource coalition cooperation that is composed of a physical plane, a physical plane, and an application plane. The virtual plane is responsible for collecting the status information of devices in the physical plane to build a resource pool and further generate the resource cooperation strategy for task assignment.\n\u2022 We study the joint optimization problem of MED satisfaction, coalition utilization assignment, and energy consumption, considering multiple constrains, i.e., the assigning capacity of tasks, latency constraints, bandwidth, and cache. And then we turn this non-convex resource optimization problem into a convex optimization programming with linear constraints.\n\u2022 We present a resource coalition cooperation approach that is based on a transferable utility (TU) coalition game. The approach uses an iterative solution to optimize the utilization of resources in the UAV coalition. Furthermore, the GM can generate a preliminary coalition structure, which can be directly applied to the coalition game to reduce iterations and further reduce energy consumption.\nThe rest of the section-wise paper outline is detailed as follows. Section II presents a brief synopsis of recent literature in this area. Section III introduces the system model. The question statement of the TU coalition is presented in Section IV. A novel TU coalition game algorithm is given in Section V. The simulation results are discussed in Section VI and conclude this paper in Section VII."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we review research on the integration of DT, aircraft, and GM to meet the new demands of future networks, such as ubiquitous edge computing, intelligent resource allocation, robust task offloading, and network design.\nA. Aerial-Assisted MEC Networks\nRecently, aerial with high mobility has received increased attention in various application scenarios, such as MEC networks and IoT. Focusing on optimizing UAV trajectory, resource allocation, and task scheduling, the authors in [15] propose two DRL algorithms to maximize the average aggregate quality of experience of all IoT devices with UAV assistance by considering user assignment, UAV trajectory, bandwidth, and computing resource allocation. The authors in [16] use UAV to assist ground users to offload the task and process the data on edge in which a decentralized user allocation and dynamic service scheme are proposed for assigning the UAV deployment, and the training of the DRL is divided into lower layer and upper layer. The authors in [17] formulate a multi-agent Markov decision process and propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization with Beta distribution framework to solve with the coupled optimization variables and the high uncertainties in the MEC network. However, these studies focus on a single UAV scenario means that there only exists one server or relay. When the number of tasks increases, resource shortages and bandwidth constraints will occur.\nExtensive research has shown that multi-UAV can also play an important role in MEC networks. A series of studies have explored how to improve the performance of the MEC networks in terms of energy consumption, latency, and total cost. The authors in [18] propose an UAV-assisted MEC system in which a user can offload its task to multi-UAV in an ad-hoc fashion for the task execution can be finished faster. The authors in [19] investigate the joint impact of task priority and mobile computing service on the MEC networks. They employ a DRL algorithm to learn an effective solution by continuous interaction between the UAV agent and environment. Fortunately, game theory provides the ideal framework for designing efficient and robust distributed algorithms. More recently, there has been growing interest in integrating game theory with MEC networks. In [20], the authors establish a dynamic DT of UAV-assisted Internet of vehicle and design a two-stage incentive mechanism for resource allocation based on the Stackelberg game to capture the time-varying resource supply and demands so that resource scheduling can be performed. However, these studies require a large number of interactions between nodes to obtain network information, which leads to increased task execution delays and energy consumption. Moreover, the resource cooperation method between nodes is not considered, and the resource utilization efficiency is low.\nB. DT-empowered Resource Allocation and Task Assignment\nThe issue of resource limitation remains a critical concern within aerial MEC networks. To enhance resource utilization, DT technology has emerged as a pivotal solution for managing resources in these networks. DT has been widely adopted in optimizing resource management for efficient MEC. In [21], the authors propose a MEC network with multi-UAV and a DT-empowered ground base station to enhance the performance of the MEC for mobile users. The authors in [22] propose a DT-empowered dynamic resource allocation strategy to meet various resource allocation requirements for users in an UAV-assisted mobile network. In [23], the authors study DT-enabled task offloading method for the UAV-aided vehicular edge computing networks to achieve computing resource management. These studies propose useful insights into the air-ground network, but they mainly focus on the ground DT.\nMore recently, there has been growing interest in the user mobility and unpredictable MEC environments. The authors in [24] propose DT-empowered UAV deployment and hybrid task offloading strategies to achieve global optimal resource allocation in aerial computing networks. Similarly, the authors in [25] study the intelligent task offloading method in an UAV-enabled MEC network with the assistance of DT. They aim to minimize the energy consumption of the entire MEC network by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, transmission power distribution, and computation capacity allocation while considering the constraints of task maximum processing delays. In [26], the researchers exploit the real-time prediction capability of DT to optimize the computation offloading decision and meet the high delay sensitivity requirements under the mismatch between the sudden demands of users and the limited computation resources of UAVs. These works have proved that the research on DT and multi-UAV is valuable and significant in terms of improving the performance of MEC systems. However, while these works use DRL, matching theory, and DT technology to achieve optimal resource allocation and task offloading strategies, they do not consider establishing a unified resource pool or utility-maximizing resource providers.\nC. Application of GM in Edge Intelligence Network\nGenerative models have emerged as a promising technology to improve the efficiency, diversity and flexibility of the content generation process by adopting a variety of AI models. Deploying generative artificial intelligent (GAI) models in intelligence networks has been expected to enhance the quality of service. The authors in [27] present the concept of mobile-edge AI-generated everything and discussed its optimization using prompt engineering and illustrate how much improvement prompt engineering can lead to in terms of quality of experiment, service latency, and bandwidth usage by a case study. Furthermore, diffusion models showed great potential in optimization since the denoising process starting from Gaussian noise can be regarded as the optimization process of finding the optimal solution. In [28], the authors propose a novel intention-driven GAI paradigm for network design, which can quickly generate a variety of customized solutions. The proposed method treat labeled trajectories in online reinforcement learning (RL) as the original data distributions, and then the offline RL with the diffusion model has the ability to operate in high-dimensional state spaces and learn new customized strategies that closely match the expected network design. The authors in [29] introduce a diffusion model to deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which greatly improves the exploration ability and achieves the better performance in many optimization problems, such as incentive mechanism design, resource allocation, and channel coding for wireless networks.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time we have researched DT-empowered task assignment by coalition game with a GM in an aerial MEC network. Specifically, the system model can monitor the status of the network in real-time and use the method of resource coalition cooperation to optimize task assignment and execution efficiency."}, {"title": "III. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "This system is designed to use high-altitude airships with high computing power, large caches, and strong communications to assist multi-UAV in completing resource optimization to adapt to MED's task assignment requests. We build DT models of UAVs in an airship to optimize the resource cooperation of aerial MEC network. With the help of DT, the system model designed in this paper is shown in Fig. 2, which is composed of a application plane, a physical plane, and a virtual plane. The model parameters are shown in Table I. Next, we describe the system model as follows.\nApplication plane: This plane involves users (e.g., road inspection vehicles, approaching reconnaissance aircraft, andsmart ships) sending task assignment requests and executing the task assignment. Specifically, the tasks are assigned to specific UAV coalitions based on resource cooperation strategies.\nPhysical plane: This plane encompasses three main functions. First, it relays the UAVs' status information and users' task assignment requests to the airship. Subsequently, the UAVs receive a resource collaboration strategy from the airship, enabling them to form the necessary coalitions. Additionally, the UAVs establish an edge computing network to provide computing services to users.\nVirtual plane: After the airship receives the intentions (e.g., the task assignment requests), it generates samples from high-utility strategies and infers a customized cooperative solution for the resource pool. And then the preliminary coalition structure is formed. Furthermore, the preliminary coalition structure could be directly applied to the coalition game to quickly work out the optional coalition cooperation strategies. The strategies are viable to make into labeled strategy datasets for particular task assignments and are stored in a standardized manner for model training. In addition, the historical data of other airship systems can be encoded into labeled strategies to further improve the quality of the datasets. Note that the GM is not limited to the diffusion model, and other models could also be applied to this proposed approach.\nA. DT Model\nIn this paper, the communication between MED and UAV (M2U) is designed to obtain the MED task parameters to build a DT model. In addition, the communication between UAV and airship (U2A) is designed to transmit the DT modeling parameters of MED and UAV. The above communication process all adopts the communication method of time division multiple access. To simplify the analysis, this paper defines the system model as a synchronous periodic time slot system, and the duration of each time slot t is \u03c4. Let the MED set be M = {1,2,\u2026\u2026,i,\u2026\u2026, m}. The ith MED is represented as $MED_i$. Then the DT of ith $MED$ in time slot t is\n$DT_{MED_i} = {I_{MED_i}, s_i, v_i, p_i^{tr}, T_i}$ (1)\nwhere $I_{MED_i}$ represents coordinate $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ of $MED_i$. $s_i$ is the amount of tasks that $MED_i$ requests to assign within the time slot t. $v_i$ represents the computing resource required to process the amount of tasks per unit, that is, computational complexity. $p_i^{tr}$ represents the transmission power of $MED_i$ for task assignment. $T_i$ represents the maximum time allowed to complete task of $MED_i$, which is $T_i < \u03c4$.\nThe set of UAV is denoted as V = {1,2,\u2026\u2026\u2026, j,\u2026\u2026\u2026, n}. Let $UAV_j$ be the ith UAV, DT of $UAV_j$ within time slot t is given as follows\n$DT_{UAV_j} = {l_{AV_j}, b_j, f_j, c_j, p_j^h}$ (2)\nwhere $l_{AV_j}$ represents the coordinate $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ of $UAV_j$. $b_j$ is communication bandwidth of $UAV_j$. $f_j$ represents the available computing resource of $UAV_j$. $c_j$ is the available cache capacity of $UAV_j$. $p_j^h$ is the hovering energy consumption of the UAV.\nB. Communication Model\nAssume that only one $MED_i$ interacts with the UAV coalition N in each time slot t, and the coordinated multiple points transmission technology based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access is introduced in the UAV coalition. And allows UAV to reuse spectrum resources with a total bandwidth of $B_{av}$ to reduce communication interference. At the same time, other UAVs and MED outside the UAV coalition are in energy-saving mode. Further, the communicationcapacity between $MED_i$ and $UAV_j$ in the time slot t is given as follows\n$C_{ij} = b \\log_2(1+ \\frac{g_{ij} p_i^{tr}}{\\sigma^2})$ (3)\nwhere $\\sigma^2$ is power of Gaussian noise. b is the bandwidth that $UAV_j$ contributes to the execution of tasks to serve $MED_i$, $b \\in B = \\{b_{i1}, ..., b_{ij}, ..., b_{in}\\}$. $g_{ij}$ is the channel gain between $MED_i$ and $UAV_j$, and its value depends on the distance between $MED_i$ and $UAV_j$, $|d_{ij} = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2}  $ i.e., $|g_{ij}|^2 = |d_{ij}|^{-\\gamma}$, path loss $\\gamma = 4$, then $|g_{ij}|^2 = (x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2 + (z_i-z_j)^2^{-2}$.\nC. Energy Consumption Model\nThe energy consumption of $UAV_j$ in time slot t mainly includes communication energy consumption, computing energy consumption, pushing energy consumption and hovering energy consumption. $E_{j,tr}^t$ is the communication energy consumption of $MED_i$ assigning tasks to $UAV_j$, and $E_{j,cp}^t$ is the computing energy consumed by $UAV_j$ to calculate the assigned task. In time slot t, the task set $S_i = \\{s_{i1}, s_{i2}, ..., s_{ij}, ..., s_{in}\\}$ is assigned from $MED_i$ to the UAV coalition, where $s_{ij}$ is the size of tasks assigned from $MED_i$ to $UAV_j$, that is, $s_{ij} \\in S_i$, and its transmission latency $T_{ij}^{tr} = s_{ij}/C_{ij}$. At this time, the computing resources contributed by the UAV coalition to complete task of $MED_i$ is $F = \\{f_{i1}, f_{i2}, ..., f_{ij}, ..., f_{in}\\}$. $f_{ij}$ is the computing resource allocated by $UAV_j$ to complete tasks, then the computing duration is $T_{ij}^{cp} = v_i s_i / f_{ij}$, and $f_{ij} > 0$. Therefore, the duration for $UAV_j$ to complete the task $s_i$ is $T_j^t = T_{ij}^{tr} + T_{ij}^{cp}$, and the delay for the UAV coalition to complete the task is $T_i^t = \\max\\{T_j^t\\}|j \\in V\\}$.\nFurthermore, the communication energy consumption spent by $MED_i$ to assign the tasks $s_{ij}$ to $UAV_j$ in time slot t is $E_{ij}^{tr} = p_i^{tr} T_{ij}^{tr}$. Then the total communication energy consumption of task $S_i$ from $MED_i$ to the UAV coalition is expressed as\n$E_{i,tr}^V = \\sum_{j \\in V} E_{ij}^{tr}$ (4)\nThe computing energy consumption of UAV is $E_{j,cp}^t = P_{j,cp}T_{ij}^{cp}$, $P_{j,cp}$ represents the computing energy consumption of $UAV_j$ per unit time, taking $P_{j,cp} = \\varepsilon_j (f_{ij})^3$, where $\\varepsilon_j$ depends on the parameter of the computing chip, and the dimension is Watt/(cycle/s)\u00b3[30]. Then the computing energy consumption of the UAV coalition is expressed as\n$E_{cp}^V = \\sum_{j \\in V} E_{j,cp}^t$ (5)\nThe pushing energy consumption and hovering energy consumption of an UAV are related to factors such as flight speed, weight, wing area, air density, motor speed, and propeller size [21, 31]. To further simplify the modeling process, it is assumed that the software and hardware of all UAVs are the same. Moreover, the UAV does not change its spatial position during the process of accepting task and executing computation, that is, the UAV's pushing energy consumption is not considered. The hovering power $p_j^h$ per unit time is a constant. The hovering duration depends on the maximum transmission latency and computing duration of the UAV executing tasks, i.e., $T_j^V$. Then, the hovering energy consumption of $UAV_j$ is $E_j^h = p_j^h T_j^V$, and the total hovering energy consumption of the UAV coalition is expressed as\n$E_h^V = \\sum_{j \\in V} E_j^h$ (6)\nConclusively, $E_t^V$ represents the corresponding total energy consumption, which is denoted as\n$E_t^V = E_{i,tr}^V + E_{cp}^V + E_h^V$ (7)"}, {"title": "IV. THE QUESTION STATEMENT OF TASK ASSIGNMENT", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the task assignment problem in the aerial MEC network and discuss its unique challenges compared with conventional task offloading in MEC networks. We then formulate a new task assignment problem in the network, which concentrates on improving the energy consumption and utilization of resources.\nA. Definition and Challenges of Task Assignment\nThe cooperation of resources from various computing devices is a fundamental problem in MEC network. The basic idea of task assignment is to offload the tasks to the appropriate computing devices, which is to improve the utilization of resources and the efficiency of task execution. However, in order to find the optimized task assignment strategy, we are mapping the multiple UAVs to the resource pool. Compared with the task offloading in MEC systems, the task assignment problem has its unique challenges. Consequently, we provideanalysis toward the unique characteristics of task assignment in aerial MEC network.\nPeer-to-peer pooling: All the devices equipped with various resources in the aerial MEC network are regarded as equal network nodes, which build a resource pool of MEC network. Specifically, the resources of all nodes can perform tasks collaboratively through cooperative games. In other words, these nodes are treated equally as the computing devices, and their resource capabilities will be uniformly scheduled.\nLow-to-high scheduling: The nodes in the aerial MEC network are composed of end users, edge servers, and cloud servers. The tasks in our proposed network can be executed in low-to-high manner according to task request: 1) one-to-one executing; 2) one-to-many assigning. In this paper, we focus on scheduling resources on multiple nodes to complete user task requests.\nOne-to-many assigning: In existing task offloading strategies, the tasks are usually offloaded to a powerful MEC server or a remote cloud server for increasing computing efficiency (i.e., one-to-one executing). However, in the proposed aerial MEC network, the tasks can be assigned from one node to many nodes.\nB. TU Coalition Definition\nIn order to formulate the resource cooperation strategy required for task assignment adapted to MED, we model the system based on coalition game theory. The problem of MED task assignment and UAV resource cooperation is described as a TU coalition game model. Furthermore, the TU coalition game in this paper is modeled as a coalition utility optimization problem under the constraints of multiple resource cooperations and task assignment delays. Assume that the TU coalition is represented by a triplet (V, G,U), and V is the set of coalition participants, that is, all UAVs. G is a set composed of any two disjoint UAV coalitions. U is a utility function that uses real functions or real numbers to allocate revenues to coalition participants, that is, coalition utility. Assume that the coalition set G = {$g_1,g_2,...,g_k,\u2026\u2026\u2026,g_K$\\} is the result of dividing the set V into multiple coalitions, $g_k$ represents the kth UAV coalition, and for $ \\forall k \neq k'$ and k, $k' \\in \\{1,2,..., K\\}$, there are $g_k, g_{k'} \\subseteq G$ and $g_k \\cap g_{k'} = \\centernot\\O$.\nC. TU Coalition Utility\nIn this paper, the multi-UAV resource cooperation method based on TU coalition game adopts logarithmic satisfaction function $\\log(1 + \\sum_{j \\in g_k} s_{ij})$ as the revenue of coalition $g_k$ to provide services for $MED_i$. Obviously, the utility depends on the total number of tasks in $g_k$. At the same time, in order to measure the communication energy consumption caused by UAV cooperative bandwidth resources in $g_k$, the communication energy consumption of task assignment is used as the cost for building a coalition. The utility function $U_{g_k}^t$ of a certain coalition $g_k \\subset G$ in time slot t is as follows\n$U_{g_k}^t = \\xi_{i} \\log(1 + \\sum_{j \\in g_k} s_{ij}) - \\sum_{j \\in g_k} E_{j,cp}^t$ (8)\nwhere $\\xi_i$ is the satisfaction factor of MED with the task assignment services provided by the UAV coalition. denotes the weight of the energy consumption compensation. The utility of the above TU coalition game also applies when any UAV works alone or when there is only one participant in a coalition, i.e., $|g_k|$ = 1.\nNext, for any UAV coalition, the information exchange between coalitions is not considered. We consider jointly optimizing the configuration of bandwidth, cache and computing resources of UAVs in the coalition in each time slot t, and maximizing the utility of the coalition. Furthermore, the paper comprehensively considers multiple constraints such as UAV's available bandwidth, cache, task size and latency requirements, and then proposes the coalition utility optimization function $F_1$ as follows\n$F_1: \\max_{s_{ij}, b_{ij}} U_{g_k}^t$\ns.t.:\n$C1: 0 \\leq b_{ij} \\leq b_{j,max}$\n$C2: \\sum_{j \\in g_k} b_{ij} \\leq B_{max}$\n$C3: 0 \\leq s_{ij} \\leq C_{i,max}$\n$C4: \\sum_{j \\in g_k} s_{ij} \\leq s_i$\n$C5: T_{g_k}^t \\leq T_i$ (9)\nwhere $b_{j,max}$ is maximum available bandwidth of $UAV_j$. $B_{max}$ is the maximum available bandwidth of the coalition where UAV is located. $C_{i,max}$ is the largest available cache of UAV. $C_1$ is the available bandwidth constraint of each UAV in the coalition $g_k$. $C_2$ means that the bandwidth resources available to all UAVs in the coalition cannot exceed the total bandwidth resources of the coalition in which they are located. $C_3$ means that the number of tasks received by each UAV cannot exceed its own maximum available cache. $C_4$ indicates that the total number of tasks in UAV coalition $g_k$ cannot exceed the task assignment amount of MED in the current time slot t. $C_5$ indicates that the time for coalition $g_k$ to complete the task must meet the latency $T_i$ requirements of MED.\nD. Coalition Participant Utility\nThe process of obtaining the maximum coalition utility is also a process in which each participant in the coalition (specifically the UAV) obtains the corresponding utility by contributing its own available resources. Moreover, the resource contribution of participants is costed by corresponding energy consumption, for which appropriate compensation is required. This paper is designed to use a weighted average to characterize the benefits of coalition participants, and $E_{j,cp}^t$ and $E_j^h$ serve as the costs incurred by coalition participants in task execution. Furthermore, the utility function of $UAV_j$ within time slot t is as follows\n$u_j^t = \\frac{U_{g_k}^t}{s_i} s_{ij} - \\alpha E_{j,cp}^t - \beta E_j^h$ (10)\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\beta$ denote the weight coefficients of $UAV_j$ computing energy consumption and hovering energy consumption, respectively.\nFurthermore, considering the constraints of the computing resources and total task execution duration of UAV in the time slot t, the utility optimization function $F_2$ of each participant in the TU coalition is designed as follows\n$F_2: \\max_{f_{ij}} u_j^t$\ns.t.:\n$C6: 0 \\leq f_{ij} \\leq f_{j,max}$\n$C7: T_{ij}^{cp} \\leq T_i - T_{ij}^{tr}$ (11)\nwhere $f_{j,max}$ is maximum available computing resources of $UAV_j$. $C6$ indicates that the $UAV_j$ can decide whether to accept the task assignment, and if it accepts, the UAV cannot be overclocked when executing its task. $C7$ denotes that the time it takes for the coalition to complete the accepted task must meet the latency requirements of the MED.\nE. Problem Conversion and Merging\nTo simplify the complexity of solving the coalition utility, this paper transforms the multi-objective nonlinear multi-constraint optimization problem represented by optimization problems $F_1$ and $F_2$ into a single-objective linear constraint optimization problem. Specifically, considering that $s_i$ has been determined in the coalition utility $F_1$, that is, the benefit of each coalition participant's utility in the optimization problem $F_2$ is constant. At the same time, $E_{j,cp}^t$ will decrease as $f_{ij}$ decreases, causing the value of the objective function of the optimization problem $F_2$ to increase. Furthermore, under the condition that constraint $C7$ is satisfied, UAV will reduce the computing resources used to complete the task, and the combined constraints $C6$ and $C7$ are as follows\n$ \\frac{v_i s_i}{(T_i - T_{ij}^{tr})} \\leq f_{ij} \\leq f_{j,max}$ (12)\nFor any coalition participant, if $\\frac{v_i s_i}{(T_{i,max} - T_{ij}^{tr})} \\leq f_{j,max}$, the computing resources contributed by that participant are $f_{ij} = \\frac{v_i s_i}{(T_{i,max} - T_{ij}^{tr})}$. If $\\frac{v_i s_i}{(T_{i,max} - T_{ij}^{tr})} > f_{j,max}$, then $f_{ij} = f_{j,max}$ Therefore, equation (12) can be further simplified as follows\n$C8: s_i \\leq T_{i,max} / (\\frac{1}{C_{ij}} + \\frac{v_i}{f_{ij,max}})$ (13)\nwhere $C_{ij}$ in $C8$ takes the maximum value $b_{ij, max}$. Then, $C5$ in $F_1$ can be further expressed linearly as follows\n$C9: s_{ij} \\leq T_{i,max} C_{ij}$ (14)\nAfter simplifying multiple constraints and merging functions $F_1$ and $F_2$, we further obtain the TU coalition game utility as follows\n$F_3: \\max_{s_{ij}, b_{ij}} U_{g_k}^t$\ns.t.:\n$C1, C2, C3, C4, C8, C9$ (15)\nIn summary, as the number of coalition participants increases, the cost of interaction between members in a coalition formed by multiple participants will also increase, resulting in a decrease in the utility that participants gain from the coalition. Therefore, how to form an optimal coalition when the coalition utility or participant utility is reduced, this paper explores the TU coalition game method based on DT."}, {"title": "V.

{"title": "Embracing AI in Education: Understanding the Surge in Large Language Model Use by Secondary Students", "authors": ["Tiffany Zhu", "Kexun Zhang", "William Yang Wang"], "abstract": "The impressive essay writing and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT have opened up new avenues in education. Our goal is to gain insights into the widespread use of LLMs among secondary students to inform their future development. Despite school restrictions, our survey of over 300 middle and high school students revealed that a remarkable 70% of students have utilized LLMs, higher than the usage percentage among young adults, and this percentage remains consistent across 7th to 12th grade. Students also reported using LLMs for multiple subjects, including language arts, history, and math assignments, but expressed mixed thoughts on their effectiveness due to occasional hallucinations in historical contexts and incorrect answers for lack of rigorous reasoning. The survey feedback called for LLMs better adapted for students, and also raised questions to developers and educators on how to help students from underserved communities leverage LLMs' capabilities for equal access to advanced education resources. We propose a few ideas to address such issues, including subject-specific models, personalized learning, and AI classrooms.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The remarkable generative capabilities of InstructGPT [16], introduced over two years ago, has led to widespread usage of large language models (LLMs). Since then, the capabilities of LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT [13], Google Gemini [18] and Meta Llama [20] have advanced significantly. According to an OpenAI report [15], GPT-4 achieves above the 90th percentile on exams like AP Biology, AP Calculus BC, and SAT math. Consequently, many middle and high school students have begun using LLMs for schoolwork assistance.\nThis growth in capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns about its impact on students' learning experiences [8]. We have observed schools implement policies restricting students from using LLMs due to concerns for cheating as well as inaccurate answers. Even OpenAI cautions secondary students against using ChatGPT, and specifically prohibits usage by children under the age of 13 [12]. While OpenAI is developing ChatGPT Edu for educational purposes [14], its audience is only university students. Consequently, the secondary school age group lacks support and influence over the services and developments of LLMs [16].\nProhibited or not, access to chatgpt.com is very easy with no registration requirement. Such openness makes it challenging to restrict LLM usage by students. Instead of imposing restrictions, we believe the best approach is to understand how students utilize LLMs and develop curriculum and adapt LLMs"}, {"title": "Data Collection", "content": "Target group Our target group consisted of middle and high school students throughout the United States and encapsulated a diverse population.\nCollection methods The survey form took just a few minutes to complete, which encouraged respon-dents to take the survey without feeling lethargic and answering randomly. We used Centiment [6], a survey platform that allowed for connections with respondents throughout the United States, who were compensated over 80 cents for completing the short survey. We also created a Google Form survey, which we shared by visiting local tutoring programs and posting on social media.\nThe following information was provided to the survey takers: \"Results of this survey are completely confidential and will be used for data analysis.\" All responses are available in a public GitHub repository with the respondents' personally identifiable information removed.\nResponse demographics Responses included students ranging from sixth to twelfth grade (Table\n2). California had the highest number of responses, as the in-person surveys were conducted in this state, and we received feedback from a total of 43 states (Figure 2). The respondents also came from various educational backgrounds, including private, public, charter, and home schooled. Lastly, the demographic encompassed students who consistently had access and students who seldom had access to technology for personal purposes."}, {"title": "Data Analysis", "content": "Figure 3 shows the usage frequency per week of LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMA, Gemini and Bing Copilot. Our survey shows that 71% of the correspondents have used LLMs at least once, while 9% used them daily. Since our survey shows 84% of the LLM users use ChatGPT, this translates to 60% of ChatGPT users among all the respondents. In comparison, 43% of young adults of age 18-29 have used ChatGPT[10]. Our survey clearly shows popularity of LLMs among the secondary students and consistency across the grades, as reported in Figure 1.\nLLMs are used in all school subjects. Previous research reveals that LLMs exhibit inferior mathe-matical abilities compared to addressing open-ended requests in English [7]. Despite this, our survey shows 28% students still used LLMs for the math subject. They also use LLMs in various other subjects, including foreign languages and history classes (Figure. 4). According to our survey, 57% of LLM users have reported finding them useful for writing text, while 43% have found them useful for math and STEM questions. We also noticed that among students who use LLMs at least twice a week, the majority of them have tried LLMs for all class subjects.\nStudents share various thoughts regarding LLM impact. Responses to an open-ended question regarding the impact of LLMs on students' academic performance were diverse, despite the common usage. The following are a few student responses with contrasting thoughts on LLMs' helpfulness.\n\"Yes, they have helped simplify complex topics.\"\n\u201cNo, increased reliance on such tools may lower the level of other fundamental skills that you develop.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes, as it may be inaccurate at certain points.\"\nSome students, like the last, believe LLMs have inaccuracies when answering factual questions, which is supported by previous research that discovered ChatGPT hallucinates the most when questions are inputted consecutively [2]. However, many other students fail to recognize the inaccuracies [21].\nMost students desire LLM improvements for schoolwork. When asked about potential improve-ments to LLMs, 3% of individuals expressed no desire for any modifications. 51% desired for more"}, {"title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "The survey shows the use of LLMs in secondary education is widespread and is expected to grow further with the advent of more capable models and increased awareness. It also shows that resource-rich students are more likely to take advantage of LLMs with their studies, potentially causing underserved students with limited learning resources to fall further behind. We therefore propose a few ideas to address the feedback and to make LLMs more useful to students of all backgrounds.\nAI models should be fine-tuned for student usage. Rather than restricting the use of LLMs in education, educators and AI developers should collaborate to build fine-tuned models trained on textbooks and teacher inputs [4]. Such models will hallucinate less and be more relevant to topics at hand. Firstly, the LLMs must integrate a diverse range of educational resources to allow the model to generate well-rounded and informed responses. Secondly, they should be trained with teacher inputs that provide additional context on topics to encourage critical thinking by prompting students to explore topics more deeply. Lastly, safeguards must be implemented to prevent the generation of inappropriate or harmful content and protect privacy.\nAI tutors can personalize learning. An AI tutor will make students' educational experiences more accessible, comprehensive and engaging due to its easy access, vast knowledge and context-aware conversation capabilities [19]. This is particularly beneficial to students in remote areas, those with disabilities, or learners who need additional help outside of traditional classrooms. AI tutors can also provide content in multiple languages and formats, catering to diverse learning needs and making education more inclusive. They can be made more useful by creating customized learning paths that adapt to a student's learning habits, providing immediate feedback and tailored quizzes, and aligning with the curriculum to address specific learning objects of various subjects and grades.\nAI classrooms promote learning equality. LLMs provide an opportunity for AI developers and teachers to work together to level the learning field for students from different demographics. We propose the idea of \u201cAI classrooms:\u201d the \u201cAI teachers\u201d in the virtual classrooms are trained on teaching videos and notes of experienced teachers. Using the multi-modal capabilities of LLMs, the \u201cAI teachers\" can \"teach\" and interact with the students in real-time. They will also proactively ask students questions and quiz them to provoke critical thinking skills. These multi-modal capabilities can also be personalized for differing learning paces. With government and industry support, the \u201cAI classrooms\" can be made free for those under-resourced districts as a supplement to students' education in school.\nLimitations of the survey. Respondents all had access to the internet in order to take the forms, introducing accessibility bias, which could lead to a higher LLM usage percentage than the national truth. The study provides educators, policymakers, and developers with information regarding LLMs in education but may not encompass all viewpoints due to the focus on students."}]}

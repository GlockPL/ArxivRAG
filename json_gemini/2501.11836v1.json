Traditional methods for detecting damages like cracks and spalls are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this study explores advanced data-driven techniques using deep learning for automated damage detection and analysis. Two state-of-the-art instance segmentation models, YOLO-v7 instance segmentation and Mask R-CNN, were evaluated using a dataset comprising 400 images, augmented to 10,995 images through geometric and color-based transformations to enhance robustness. The models were trained and validated using a dataset split into 90% training set, validation and test set 10%. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), and frames per second (FPS) were used for evaluation. YOLO-v7 achieved a superior mAP@0.5 of 96.1% and processed 40 FPS, outperforming Mask R-CNN, which achieved a mAP@0.5 of 92.1% with a slower processing speed of 18 FPS. The findings recommend YOLO-v7 instance segmentation model for real-time, high-speed structural health monitoring, while Mask R-CNN is better suited for detailed offline assessments.

Periodic inspections are particularly critical for concrete structures, such as bridges, building walls, tunnels, and dams, to identify potential defects that may compromise structural integrity. Common indicators of structural health deterioration include defects like cracks and spalls [4]. These issues often arise due to fatigue and periodic loading, underscoring the need for early, timely, and automated diagnostic methods [5]. Implementing proactive measures can significantly reduce financial costs and mitigate human safety risks associated with structural failures."}, {"title": "1.1 Problem Definition", "content": "Data-driven techniques for defect detection in concrete structures are gaining traction due to advancements in hardware and software technologies. These methods can be categorized into two groups:\n1. Non-intelligent Monitoring: Traditional approaches, such as visual inspections and manual experiments, heavily depend on human expertise, leading to safety risks, inefficiencies, and inaccuracies. These methods are often labor-intensive and time-consuming [15].\n2. Intelligent Monitoring: Advanced methodologies, including image processing, machine learning, and deep learning, address the limitations of traditional approaches. These techniques facilitate cost-effective, precise, and automated monitoring of structural health [16].\nConcrete SHM often involves managing large datasets. Techniques like instance segmentation in deep learning help in extracting meaningful patterns from this data. By employing vision-based algorithms, structural damage can be accurately identified, classified, and localized, ensuring timely interventions. Moreover, the ability to utilize pre-trained models and transfer learning has significantly enhanced the accessibility and efficiency of deep learning-based SHM systems [17]."}, {"title": "1.2 Methods for Detection", "content": "Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, encompasses various learning paradigms, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning [18]. These approaches require collecting, preprocessing, and preparing data before applying algorithms for classification and pattern extraction. Techniques such as transfer learning, augmented datasets, and pre-trained networks (e.g., the SDNE2018 dataset, which contains 56,000 images of bridges and walls) expedite the training process and improve accuracy [19].\nClassification and segmentation methods are crucial in SHM. Classification involves categorizing data into distinct classes, such as cracks, spalls, or intact regions. Instance segmentation extends classification by identifying individual defects within a broader context, providing detailed insights into structural health [20]. Additionally, few-shot learning methods address data limitations by focusing on learning patterns from minimal data samples. This innovative approach has proven effective across diverse fields, including image classification, natural language processing, and structural damage detection [21]."}, {"title": "1.3 State of the Research Field", "content": "Concrete defect detection has evolved from heuristic and machine vision techniques to sophisticated deep learning methods. Traditional image processing filters, such as Canny and Sobel, were once prevalent but limited in handling complex structural defects [10]. The advent of artificial neural networks (ANNs) brought significant advancements, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) leading the charge [11].\nCNN-based techniques bypass manual feature extraction, enabling direct learning of image features. For instance, Cha and Choi [20] demonstrated the efficacy of deep CNN models under variable brightness and shadow conditions. Similarly, studies employing hybrid models\u2014merging CNNs with traditional methods like Otsu filtering\u2014achieved higher accuracy in detecting cracks and predicting their direction [21]. Recent research also explores transformer-based models, which, despite higher computational costs, exhibit enhanced flexibility and reduced bias compared to CNNs [28]."}, {"title": "1.4 Diverging Hypotheses and Controversies", "content": "While deep learning techniques promise unprecedented accuracy, there are debates surrounding their scalability and computational efficiency. Transformer-based models, despite their high potential, pose challenges due to elevated computational demands. Moreover, data-driven approaches often rely on the availability of large, high-quality datasets. Inconsistent data labeling and variability in imaging conditions further complicate model generalization [28].\nAnother point of contention is the effectiveness of semantic versus instance segmentation methods. While semantic segmentation identifies damage categories, instance segmentation distinguishes between multiple defects within the same category. Researchers like Mousavi and Bakhshi [30] advocate for encoder-decoder architectures like ResNet101 coupled with U-Net for enhanced segmentation, achieving 99.39% accuracy."}, {"title": "1.5 Significance and Purpose of Study", "content": "This study aims to advance SHM through innovative deep learning methodologies, leveraging combined datasets to enhance generalizability.

Traditional inspection methods,\nsuch as manual visual assessments and non-destructive testing (NDT), are often costly, time-intensive,\nand prone to human error. To overcome these limitations, this research explores the application of\nadvanced deep learning algorithms for vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). A dataset\nof wind turbine surface images, featuring categories of damage and pollution, was prepared and\naugmented to enhance model training. Three state-of-the-art algorithms\u2014YOLOv7, its lightweight\nvariant, and Faster R-CNN\u2014were employed to detect and classify surface damage.

Over the years, detecting and mitigating structural damage has been paramount for\nindustries relying on these infrastructures, including renewable energy. Traditionally, structural damage detection was\nreliant on manual inspections, visual assessments, and non-destructive testing (NDT) methods. While these approaches\noffer valuable insights, they suffer from limitations such as high costs, reliance on human expertise, subjectivity,\nand potential safety risks for inspectors operating in hazardous conditions [6, 7]. These challenges necessitate the\nexploration of more efficient, reliable, and automated solutions."}, {"title": "1.1 Importance of Automated Damage Detection", "content": "Wind turbines are critical to the renewable energy sector, contributing to sustainable energy generation worldwide.\nHowever, they are exposed to various environmental and operational stresses, such as erosion, cracks, lightning strikes,\nand dirt accumulation, which can degrade their performance and shorten their lifespan [1, 3]. Effective and timely\ndamage detection is crucial for mitigating these effects, minimizing maintenance costs, and ensuring continuous energy\nproduction.\nManual inspection methods, such as climbing inspections and ground-based visual assessments, are labor-intensive and\noften pose safety risks. Additionally, traditional NDT techniques, including ultrasonic testing and thermography, require\nspecialized equipment and trained personnel, making them costly and time-consuming [4, 5]. In contrast, vision-based\nautomated systems offer non-contact inspection capabilities, covering large areas efficiently while enabling real-time\nanalysis. This shift towards automation is particularly critical for remote and offshore wind turbines, where access is\noften challenging [2]."}, {"title": "1.2 Advancements in Deep Learning for SHM", "content": "Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of image-based damage detection\nsystems. CNNs, such as Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, have been widely adopted for structural damage detection\ntasks, demonstrating high accuracy in detecting cracks, corrosion, and other surface anomalies [9, 10]. For instance,\nFaster R-CNN achieved an average mean Average Precision (mAP) of 87.8% in detecting various damage types,\nincluding cracks and corrosion [9]. Similarly, Mask R-CNN has been employed for crack segmentation, offering both\ndetection and localization with high accuracy [10].\nYOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms have emerged as a breakthrough in real-time object detection, owing to\ntheir high speed and accuracy. YOLOv7, the latest iteration, introduces trainable bag-of-freebies that enhance its\nperformance compared to earlier versions, making it highly suitable for real-time structural inspections [21]. Studies\nhave shown that YOLO-based models outperform traditional methods in terms of detection speed and precision, as\nevenced by the application of YOLOv2 for crack detection on concrete structures [13]."}, {"title": "1.3 Controversial Hypotheses and Diverging Perspectives", "content": "Despite the success of deep learning methods in SHM, some researchers argue about their scalability and reliability in\nreal-world applications. For instance, challenges such as dataset limitations, variability in environmental conditions,\nand computational requirements are often cited as potential barriers [7, 8]. Additionally, while transfer learning and\npre-trained models such as ImageNet have accelerated the development of SHM systems, their adaptation to specific\nstructural contexts remains a contentious issue. Critics emphasize the need for domain-specific datasets and customized\narchitectures to achieve optimal results [15].\nAnother area of debate is the trade-off between detection speed and accuracy. While YOLOv7 is celebrated for its\nreal-time capabilities, some researchers highlight its limitations in handling small or low-contrast defects compared to\nmulti-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN [18, 14]. These diverging hypotheses underscore the importance of comparative\nstudies that evaluate multiple algorithms under diverse conditions."}, {"title": "1.4 Purpose and Significance of the Study", "content": "The primary objective of this study is to develop an automated system for detecting and localizing surface damage in\nwind turbine structures using image-based deep learning methods.

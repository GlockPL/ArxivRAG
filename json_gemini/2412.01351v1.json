Lifelong learning is a crucial factor in securing employment or enhancing one's existing career prospects. To achieve this objective, this study proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for the evaluation of training courses in accordance with their capacity to enhance the employ- ability of the students. The methodology is delineated in four stages. Firstly, a 'working life curve' was defined to provide a quantitative description of an individual's working life. Secondly, an analysis based on K-medoids clustering defined a control group for each individual for comparison. Thirdly, the performance of a course according to each of the four predefined criteria was calculated using a t-test to determine the mean perfor- mance value of those who took the course. Ultimately, the unweighted TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the efficacy of the various training courses in relation to the four criteria. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of using extensive datasets within a system while facilitating the application of a multi-criteria unweighted TOP- SIS method. The results of the multi-criteria TOPSIS method indicated that training courses related to the professional fields of administration and management, hostel and tourism and community and sociocultural services have positive impact on employability and improving the working conditions of citizens. However, courses that demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in ranking are the least demanded by citizens. The results will help policymakers evaluate the effectiveness of each training course offered by the regional government.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Lifelong learning is a core concept that describes individual learning during the entire lifecycle from early socialisation and pre-school education to retirement age in terms of employment (Gal et al., 2007). The term lifelong learning is broadly defined and refers to 'all learning activity undertaken throughout life, to improve knowledge, skills, and competencies within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective' (European Comission, 2001)."}, {"title": null, "content": "This concept addresses three fundamental objectives of education: i) personal fulfilment and development throughout life (cultural capital); ii) active citizenship and inclusion (social cohesion); and iii) employability and economic growth (human capital). In this study, we focus on the impact of lifelong learning on the third objective, namely, the working life of both employed and unemployed people, which is considered essential either for obtaining a job or for improving the job one already has. In this regard, many national and regional governments in Europe dedicate part of their policy budgets to providing training courses that can offer new skills to their citizens.\nThe importance of lifelong learning for improving employability and the quality of em- ployment is evident. Numerous studies have confirmed the positive effect of lifelong learning education on improving employability. One example is the study by J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m et al. (2020), which asserts that a highly skilled and knowledgeable worker is an asset to any organisation, and skillsets are often associated with promotion, salary increases, and career success. Babos et al. (2015) also concluded that most individuals who participated in lifelong learning recognised it as a positive contributor to their employability. The work of Sharma et al. (2024) uses micro-credential courses for upskilling and reskilling, demonstrating their pos- itive impact on enhancing employability. To achieve this, interviews were conducted with 65 participants from India, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom to explore how micro-credentials can be a valuable addition to the higher education ecosystem. Therefore, to provide quality training, it is crucial to have the necessary tools to measure the effect of these educational training courses on employment.\nThe accelerating pace of scientific and technological advancements and the resulting soci- etal and economic (or labour market) changes at any given time necessitate lifelong learning. This is why policymakers continually face the problem of ensuring that individuals acquire the relevant skills and knowledge to improve employability. Hence, there is a need to design and select education training courses that adapt to the requirements of the labour market. To address this issue, the public employment service of the region of Extremadura (Spain) provided historical data and requested a scientific analysis of the impact that the realisation or not of different continuous training courses has on the working lives of those enrolled. The key contribution of this work is the development of a multi-criteria decision support system that will help policymakers evaluate each training course offered by the regional government and rank them according to improvement in the labour life of students. This is important because only with precise data can the regional government determine where more resources should be invested and which courses are less efficient. The proposed methodology combined the challenges of using large amounts of data in the system and the application of a multi-criteria unweighted method.\nOne of the most commonly used multi-criteria methods is the TOPSIS method, which is based on distances to ideal and anti-ideal solutions. In TOPSIS, as in other multi-criteria decision (MCDM) methods, the objective is to help decision makers choose the best option among several alternatives based on various criteria that may conflict with one another. These criteria may also have different levels of importance. Therefore, assigning criteria weights is a crucial step in any MCDM method. The weights can significantly affect the final decision even with slight changes. A common method of determining weights is the use of expert opinion. Experts in the field can define the preferences of the criteria using specific methodologies, such as reaching an agreement (Delphi method Sackman (1974)) or comparing criteria in pairs (AHP Saaty and Vargas (2012)). However, these expert-based methods have a major drawback: they introduce subjective views that can bias the process.\nMany researchers in the field of multi-criteria analysis have been interested in finding more objective methods for determining criteria weighting. Examples of these methods include the Entropy method (Shannon, 1948), the LINMAP method (Srinivasan and Shocker, 1973), and recent approaches such as the IDOCRIW method (Zavadskas and Podvezko, 2016), the Bayesian approach (Vinogradova et al., 2018) and the FUCOM method (Pamucar et al., 2018)."}, {"title": "2 Related works", "content": "Analysing the effect of a certain factor or treatment on a sample is common in many scientific fields. In such analyses, it is essential to define a control group to contrast the results. For example, in pharmacy, a control group helps determine whether a new medication is effective and in agronomy, it is used to study the effects of different fertilisers. In these scientific fields, it is common for researchers to have control over both the sample they are studying and the control group that they use to compare results. In this way, it is possible to select homogeneous samples with similar individuals so that the comparisons make sense and the possible differences can be attributed only to the factor or treatment being analysed.\nHowever, in social sciences, the situation is often much more complicated. For example, when assessing the effects of participating in a certain activity on individuals, researchers may have limited control over the sample being analysed, which can lead to heterogeneity among participants. In addition, in some studies, the control group has not been previously defined, making the comparison of results with those of individuals who have not participated in the activity a nontrivial process.\nIn this study, we present a methodology that allows us to assess the impact that the realisation or not of different continuous training courses, offered by the public employment service of the region of Extremadura (Spain), has on the working life of the people enrolled in them. To evaluate the effectiveness of training courses, it is necessary to determine mea- surable criteria. Many studies have based the evaluation of the criteria on the subjective perceptions of actors such as students, teachers and organisers (Kirkpatrick, 2006; Farjad, 2012; Sharma et al., 2024). In contrast, the proposed methodology is entirely data-driven. This involves constructing a database that includes information from various departments of the regional government, such as education, labour and social security\nWhen assessing the usefulness of a training course, one might be tempted to analyse the quality of working life before and after taking the course and to check whether there has been improvement, according to predefined criteria. However, this can be misleading for two main reasons: first, the quality of working life is likely to improve over time, and second, it is crucial to compare these improvements with those of individuals who have not completed the course. In other words, how much (if any) improvement can be attributed to the training course, or can it all be explained by the natural improvement in the working life of a person?\nTo accurately determine whether the obtained results were due to the course, it is nec- essary to compare the results with those of a control group consisting of individuals who have not completed the course. Several authors have addressed the problem of determining the control group for this type of study in various ways. For example, Rotar (2021) stud- ied the evaluation of employment programmes in the Netherlands, with the control group defined as individuals in the same age range as the study group who did not participate"}, {"title": null, "content": "in any employment programme in 2008. This study was limited to a specific period (only 2008 was considered). In contrast, another study (Elena, 2014) considered the effectiveness of vocational training and defined the control group as individuals who enrolled in the train- ing course but did not attend (no-shows). In other cases (Towler et al., 2019), the analysis focused on a specific type of course in which learning certain skills was evaluated. In these instances, the determination of the control group is simpler because it is sufficient to con- sider individuals who took similar courses in which that skill was not taught. Similarly, in another study (Sanulita et al., 2024), the effectiveness of audiovisual learning programmes was analysed using an experimental design with a post-test-only control group. The study involved two classes: the experimental group that received the specific treatment and the control group that did not.\nThus, determining the control group is not a simple task. This presents two major challenges. The first is how to define a control group in a manner that ensures that similar individuals are compared and that the comparison is sensible. This is difficult because, in our case, the students taking the course are not a homogeneous group; they have different backgrounds, ages, and other characteristics. Consequently, the construction of the control group should be individualised, meaning that a specific control group should be defined for each individual taking the course. The second challenge is even more complex. If the people in the control group have not taken the course (by definition), how can we establish a valid 'before' and 'after' comparison?\nTo address these challenges, we first define a \u2018working life curve' (WLC) that allows us to quantitatively describe the working life of an individual. Using these WLCs, we can measure the similarity between two distinct individuals. In addition, using a methodology based on K-medoids clustering (Park and Jun, 2009), we define a control group for each individual to facilitate comparison. The performance of each course, in relation to the four predefined criteria, is calculated as the average performance of the individuals who took the course, as assessed using a t-test comparison. Finally, we propose the uwTOPSIS method to rank the effectiveness of different training courses according to four criteria (Ben\u00edtez and Liern, 2021; Liern and P\u00e9rez-Gladish, 2022).\nThe reason for selecting the uwTOPSIS multi-criteria method over the existing methods was the challenge of determining precise subjective weights from experts. The proposed multi-criteria method ranks decision alternatives based on the classical TOPSIS approach; however, this method does not require the introduction of fixed prior weights. Instead, it uses lower and upper bounds to express the varying importance of the criteria, thereby allowing for more objective assessment without the bias introduced by subjective weighting. Developed in 2020, this innovative multi-criteria method differs from other known multi-criteria techniques, such as VIKOR, PROMETHEE or MOORA, as it does not assign fixed weights a priori to a criterion; instead, upper and lower bounds are set.\nRecent studies related to the case study have applied the uwTOPSIS method for the reasons explained above. For example, Blasco-Blasco et al. (2021b) proposed an academic performance indicator for science and engineering students at the Industrial University of Santander (Colombia). Similarly, L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda et al. (2023) used the uwTOPSIS method to develop a methodology for the early detection of student failure. Other studies in differ- ent fields, such as sustainability and tourism, have also demonstrated the efficiency of the uwTOPSIS method in multi-criteria decision-making processes (Blasco-Blasco et al., 2021a; P\u00e9rez-Gladish et al., 2021; Liern et al., 2021; L\u00f3pez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "3 Data", "content": "The data used in this study are a subset of the data stored in a data warehouse that we built in collaboration with the regional government of Extremadura to support a data-driven strategy aimed at reducing unemployment in the Extremadura region (Conejero et al., 2021b,a)."}, {"title": null, "content": "All details regarding the construction of this data warehouse, including the identification of the data sources, the description of the data collected, the design of the data warehouse schema and the creation of an automated data collection process, are detailed in Section 3 of Conejero et al.

That is, if N(t) is the number of days under employment until day t, then we have the following:\n$WLC(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{t}, \\quad t = 1, 2, ...$\nAn example of a typical WLC is shown in Figure 2.\nWhen constructing the WLC, two points are convenient to emphasise:"}, {"title": null, "content": "\u2022 Determination of the date of origin of working life. Normally, the beginning of working life is defined as the earliest between the start date of the first labour contract and the end date of the last regular study taken (not including the possible SEXPE training courses taken).\n\u2022 In many cases, the end date of a contract is not recorded and appears in the database as NULL. More than 25% of the contracts do not have an appropriately assigned end date. Therefore, a mechanism to assign an end date to the contract must be established.\nIn this case, we proceed as follows:"}, {"title": "4.2 Definition of the control group", "content": "1. We consider as adjusted end date the midpoint of the quarter following the start of the contract. That is, if month denotes the month in which the contract started, then we have the following:\nIf month \u2208 {January, February, March}, then date_adjusted= 15th of May.\nIf month \u2208 {April, May, June}, then date_adjusted= 15th of August.\nIf month \u2208 {July, August, September}, then date_adjusted= 15th of Novem- ber.\nIf month \u2208 {October, November, December}, then date_adjusted= 14th of February of the following year.\n2. The beginning date of the next contract (if any) is also considered.\n3. The final date is considered the earliest between the two above dates: the earliest date between date_adjusted and the date at the beginning of the next contract.\nIt may happen that reality does not conform to this methodology and that there are reasons why no contract end date was communicated. However, in our opinion, this methodology is a systematic and sensible way to assign end dates.\nThe next step is to compare the WLC of person $p_i$ who has completed a particular training course with that of other people who have not. In particular, we want to determine whether from the completion of a course, at instance $t_i$ (measured in days), the working life of an individual improves in horizon h, that is, in the interval $[t_i, t_i + h]$, when compared with a group of people who did not take that course and, up to moment $t_i$, had a labour behaviour similar to that of the individual in question.\nAssume that from a course $C_j$ under study, we take an individual $p_i$ who has taken the course at instance $t_i$ (measured in days since the beginning of his or her working life). Note that, in addition to $t_i$, for each person in the database, we know the sex, age and educational level at each instance. The control group for $p_i$ (denoted $CG_i$) is obtained in three stages.\nFirst, we filter the database by considering only individuals of the same sex as $p_i$, age within 5 years of the age of $p_i$, the same educational level at time $t_i$ as person $p_i$, and working life at least as long as that of $p_i$ plus horizon h (in days). This defines the \u2018initial control group' for $p_i$ (denoted$CG_{i0}$).\nHowever, given the massive size of the database, the initial control group $CG_{i0}$ is expected to be large. Therefore, a second filter is required. The aim is to select from $CG_{i0}$ individuals"}, {"title": null, "content": "whose WLCs are most similar to the WLC of the person under investigation. The next problem is determining the number of 'nearest neighbors' to $p_i$ because this depends heavily on the course and the individual in question.\nTo address these issues, we propose a methodology based on K-medoids clustering (Park and Jun, 2009). The general idea is to consider, given person $p_i$, the WLCs corresponding to $CG_{i0} \\cup {p_i}$, all of them in the interval $[0, t_i]$. Then, the control group of $p_i$ (denoted $GC_i$) is the optimal cluster containing $p_i$ for K-medoids clustering. The optimality is determined using the GAP statistic (Tibshirani et al., 2001), and the PAM algorithm (Schubert and Rousseeuw, 2019) is used for the clustering procedure.\nNevertheless, we must note that the size of the initial control group is in the thousands, or even in the tens of thousands. Thus, obtaining the GAP statistic for each person is computationally extremely expensive. To overcome this challenge, pilot tests were conducted, and the optimal number of clusters did not vary greatly from one individual to another. Therefore, instead of determining the optimal number of clusters for each participant who took a specific training course, we computed such an optimal number for a randomly selected sample and took the mode as the optimal number of clusters for the given training course. This number was used to determine the control groups of all participants in the training course.\nFigure 3 summarises the three stages involved in determining the control group for a specific person $p_i$ taking course $C_j$.

Each criterion may be beneficial (i.e. 'the more the better') or a cost (i.e. 'the less the better'). Let $J^+$ and $J_\u2212$ denote the sets of indices j corresponding to benefit and cost criteria, respectively.\nThe classical TOPSIS algorithm proceeds as follows (Hwang and Yoon, 1981; Tzeng and Huang, 2011):\nSTEP 1: Determine decision matrix $X = [x_{ij}]_{nxm}$ where element $x_{ij}$ is the performance rating of alternative $A_i$ at criterion $C_j$.\nSTEP 2: Construct the normalised matrix $\\tilde{X}$ as follows:\n$\\tilde{x}_{ij} = \\frac{x_{ij}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{kj}}},  \\tilde{x}_{ij} \\in [0,1], \\quad 1 \\le i \\le n, \\quad 1 \\le j \\le m$."}, {"title": null, "content": "STEP 3: Determine the positive ideal solution, $A^+ = (A^+_1, A^+_2,..., A^+_m)$, and the negative ideal (or anti-ideal) solution, $A^- = (A^\u2212_1, A^\u2212_2, ..., A^\u2212_m)$, as follows:\n$A^+_j = \\begin{cases} \\max \\limits_{1<i<n} \\tilde{r}_{ij} & \\text{if $j\\in J_+$} \\\\ \\min \\limits_{1<i<n} \\tilde{r}_{ij} & \\text{if $j\\in J_-$} \\end{cases} \\quad A^-_j = \\begin{cases} \\min \\limits_{1<i<n} \\tilde{r}_{ij} & \\text{if $j\\in J_+$} \\\\ \\max \\limits_{1<i<n} \\tilde{r}_{ij} & \\text{if $j\\in J_-$} \\end{cases}$ \nSTEP 4: Given a weight vector $w \\in \\Omega$, where\n$\\Omega = \\{(w_1, w_2, ..., w_m) \\in \\mathbb{R}^m, \\quad 0 \\leq w_j \\leq 1, \\quad \\sum_{j=1}^{m}w_j=1\\}$\nwe calculate the weighted normalised matrix, $[w_j\\tilde{r}_{ij}]$.\nSTEP 5: Determine the weighted distances between each alternative $A_i$ and the ideal and anti-ideal solutions as follows:\n$d_i^+ (w) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(w_j\\tilde{r}_{ij} - w_jA^+_j)^2}, \\quad d_i^\u2212 (w) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{m}(w_j\\tilde{r}_{ij} - w_jA^-_j)^2}.$\nSTEP 6: Compute the score for each alternative as follows:\n$R_i(w) = \\frac{d_i^\u2212 (w)}{d_i^\u2212 (w) + d_i^+ (w)}, \\quad i = 1,..., n.$\nRemark 4.1. In this study, following the original proposal in Hwang and Yoon (1981), we use vector normalisation in Step 2. However, other normalisation procedures have also been successfully applied (Ouenniche et al., 2018; Cables et al., 2016). Likewise, the Euclidean distance in Step 5 can be replaced by many other distances (Ouenniche et al., 2018).\nTOPSIS is very easily implemented and applied; however, weight determination (Step 4) is a significant concern because a small change in any of them can lead to different final rankings. Inspired by Liern and P\u00e9rez-Gladish (2022), the proposed method attempts to avoid subjective weight assignment by treating weights as decision variables. For this purpose, we consider vector w (Step 4) as a vector of decision variables. Therefore, for each alternative, expression (2) defines a function as follows:\n$R_i: \\Omega \\rightarrow [0,1], \\quad i = 1, ..., n.$\nGiven the extreme values of the function $R_i$ in (3) for each alternative, we can define a ranking. Thus, we must to compute the following:\n$R^\u2212_i = \\min \\begin{Bmatrix} R_i(w): \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{m}w_j = 1, l_j \\leq w_j \\leq u_j, 1 \\leq j \\leq m \\end{Bmatrix}$ \n$R^+_i = \\max \\begin{Bmatrix} R_i(w): \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{m}w_j = 1, l_j \\leq w_j \\leq u_j, 1 \\leq j \\leq m \\end{Bmatrix}$ \nNote that parameters $l_j$ and $u_j$, j = 1...,m, are lower and upper bounds for weights, respectively. All $l_j$ values should be positive; otherwise, some criteria will not be considered."}, {"title": null, "content": "However, the upper bounds should not be very large because assigning a large weight to one criterion has similar consequences to ignoring the other criterion.\nFrom (4) and (5), we define the following interval for each alternative:\n$R_i = [R^\u2212_i, R^+_i], \\quad i = 1,...,n.$\nFinally, to rank the different alternatives, Step 7 should be extended to ordering intervals rather than real numbers.\nA wide range of methods for ordering intervals A = [$a_1$, $a_2$] and B = [$b_1$, $b_2$] is available in the literature (Gil-Aluja, 1999; Ram\u00edk and \u00edm\u00e1nek, 1985). However, in this study, we follow the proposal in Can\u00f3s and Liern (2008) as follows:\n$A \\succ B \\Leftrightarrow  \\begin{cases}  k_1a_1 + k_2a_2 > k_1b_1+k_2b_2, &  \\text{$k_1a_1 + k_2a_2 \\ne k_1b_1 + k_2b_2$} \\\\  a_1 > b_1, &  \\text{$k_1a_1+k_2a_2 = k_1b_1 + k_2b_2$,} \\\\  \\end{cases}$\nwhere $k_1$ and $k_2$ are two pre-established positive constants such that $k_1$ + $k_2$ = 1.\nDefinition 4.1. Given the alternatives {Ai}i=1n and the set of interval-valued proximities to the ideal solution {Ri}i=1n given by (6), we conclude that alternative A\u00bf is preferable to alternative Ak whenever Ri > Rk. In addition, we define the uwTOPSIS indicator $R^{uw}$ of alternative A as follows:\n$R^{uw}_i = k_1R^\u2212_i + k_2R^+_i, \\quad 1\\leq i \\leq n.$\nThe $k_1$ and $k_2$ (or 1 \u2013 $k_1$) values can be considered a measure of the decision maker's propensity to consider a more pessimistic (or conservative) or optimistic scenario. The choice of one or another value of $k_1$ depends on the problem in question and, above all, on the existence of external constraints that may incline the decision-maker towards one of the extremes of the interval obtained in (6). In our case, in the absence of such constraints, we rank the intervals by taking $k_1$ = $k_2$ = 0.5 in (7). Specifically, we use as the uwTOPSIS indicator the midpoints of the intervals [$R^\u2212_i, R^+_i$] (see equation (8)).\nThe main drawback associated with this method is the computational difficulty of solving 2n nonlinear optimisation problems. To overcome this problem, we used R statistical software (R Core Team, 2019) together with the package nloptr (Ypma, J., 2013) which is an R port of the open-source nonlinear library developed by S.G. Johnson (Johnson, 2022). The minimising algorithm used to solve problems (4) and (5) was the Constrained Optimisation by Linear Approximations algorithm developed in Powell (1994)."}, {"title": "5 Results", "content": "After the first filtering (sex, age, educational level, and length of working life), the potential size of the control groups had a very skewed distribution to the right, with a mean of 2170 persons and a median of 1662 persons (Figure 4).\nIn all these potential control groups, the Euclidean distance between the individual's labour curve and the labour curves of the persons included in the corresponding potential group was calculated. The potential group was then ordered in increasing order.\nWe then proceeded to find the final control groups by k-means clustering and determined the optimal number of clusters using the GAP statistic. Because of the high computational complexity of calculating the GAP statistic, we decided to simplify the calculation by first reducing the potential size of the control group to 500 individuals (i.e. the 500 individuals closest to the person under study).

This is because by limiting the number of individuals to 500 and forcing clusterings of five groups, in some cases in which the potential group was very large (several thousand individuals), the 500 closest people were already very similar to the person under study, so the optimal grouping was to make a group with 496 individuals and then another four groups with a single individual (Figure 6)."}, {"title": "5.2 Criteria assessment", "content": "The general distribution of course performance for different criteria is shown in Figure 7. It is worth noting that individual scores were, in general terms, quite extreme. Notably, they were either close to 1 or close to 0. Hence, the performance of a course at a certain criterion was highly and positively correlated to the percentage of students of that course that would have not passed a t-test at a standard significance level (e.g. 5% or 10%).\nAs shown in Figure 7, criteria C2 and C3 were rarely met by respondents. The C2 criterion ('total number of days with a permanent contract') is very restrictive in Spain and even more so in regions such as Extremadura, where employment is characterised by high levels of temporary employment. Therefore, the results obtained for different courses under criterion C2 were as expected.\nIn contrast, the poor performance results for criterion C3 ('number of days in a position related to the course taken'), provided us some useful information. The fact that the results for this criterion were also very poor indicates that, in general, SEXPE training courses do not provide specific training relevant to the Extremaduran labour market."}, {"title": "5.3 Course ranking", "content": "Once the different alternatives were evaluated for each of the four criteria and the performance matrix was obtained, we ranked them using the uwTOPSIS method described above.

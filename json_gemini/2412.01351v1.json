Lifelong learning is a crucial factor in securing employment or enhancing one's existing career prospects. To achieve this objective, this study proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria decision support system for the evaluation of training courses in accordance with their capacity to enhance the employability of the students. The methodology is delineated in four stages. Firstly, a 'working life curve' was defined to provide a quantitative description of an individual's working life. Secondly, an analysis based on K-medoids clustering defined a control group for each individual for comparison. Thirdly, the performance of a course according to each of the four predefined criteria was calculated using a t-test to determine the mean performance value of those who took the course. Ultimately, the unweighted TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the efficacy of the various training courses in relation to the four criteria. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of using extensive datasets within a system while facilitating the application of a multi-criteria unweighted TOPSIS method. The results of the multi-criteria TOPSIS method indicated that training courses related to the professional fields of administration and management, hostel and tourism and community and sociocultural services have positive impact on employability and improving the working conditions of citizens. However, courses that demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in ranking are the least demanded by citizens. The results will help policymakers evaluate the effectiveness of each training course offered by the regional government.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Lifelong learning is a core concept that describes individual learning during the entire lifecycle from early socialisation and pre-school education to retirement age in terms of employment (Gal et al., 2007). The term lifelong learning is broadly defined and refers to 'all learning activity undertaken throughout life, to improve knowledge, skills, and competencies within a personal, civic, social and/or employment-related perspective' (European Comission, 2001)."}, {"title": "2 Related works", "content": "Analysing the effect of a certain factor or treatment on a sample is common in many scientific fields. In such analyses, it is essential to define a control group to contrast the results. For example, in pharmacy, a control group helps determine whether a new medication is effective and in agronomy, it is used to study the effects of different fertilisers. In these scientific fields, it is common for researchers to have control over both the sample they are studying and the control group that they use to compare results. In this way, it is possible to select homogeneous samples with similar individuals so that the comparisons make sense and the possible differences can be attributed only to the factor or treatment being analysed.\nHowever, in social sciences, the situation is often much more complicated. For example, when assessing the effects of participating in a certain activity on individuals, researchers may have limited control over the sample being analysed, which can lead to heterogeneity among participants. In addition, in some studies, the control group has not been previously defined, making the comparison of results with those of individuals who have not participated in the activity a nontrivial process.\nIn this study, we present a methodology that allows us to assess the impact that the realisation or not of different continuous training courses, offered by the public employment service of the region of Extremadura (Spain), has on the working life of the people enrolled in them. To evaluate the effectiveness of training courses, it is necessary to determine measurable criteria. Many studies have based the evaluation of the criteria on the subjective perceptions of actors such as students, teachers and organisers (Kirkpatrick, 2006; Farjad, 2012; Sharma et al., 2024). In contrast, the proposed methodology is entirely data-driven. This involves constructing a database that includes information from various departments of the regional government, such as education, labour and social security\nWhen assessing the usefulness of a training course, one might be tempted to analyse the quality of working life before and after taking the course and to check whether there has been improvement, according to predefined criteria. However, this can be misleading for two main reasons: first, the quality of working life is likely to improve over time, and second, it is crucial to compare these improvements with those of individuals who have not completed the course. In other words, how much (if any) improvement can be attributed to the training course, or can it all be explained by the natural improvement in the working life of a person?\nTo accurately determine whether the obtained results were due to the course, it is nec- essary to compare the results with those of a control group consisting of individuals who have not completed the course. Several authors have addressed the problem of determining the control group for this type of study in various ways. For example, Rotar (2021) stud- ied the evaluation of employment programmes in the Netherlands, with the control group defined as individuals in the same age range as the study group who did not participate"}, {"title": "3 Data", "content": "The data used in this study are a subset of the data stored in a data warehouse that we built in collaboration with the regional government of Extremadura to support a data-driven strategy aimed at reducing unemployment in the Extremadura region (Conejero et al., 2021b,a)."}, {"title": "3.1 Datasets", "content": "In this study, a subset of the information stored in the aforementioned data warehouse was used. In particular, the information was obtained from the following four different datasets, with their fields described in Table 1:\n(a) DS1 This dataset includes citizens who have not participated in any training courses. It contains a row for each regulated study level of each citizen who has not taken a training course. For instance, a citizen with lower secondary education and bachelor's, and master's degrees will appear four times in this view. This table contains 196,120 rows corresponding to studies out of 112,638 different citizens.\n(b) DS2. This dataset includes citizens who have participated in training courses. It contains a row for each regulated study level of each citizen who has taken at least one training course. For example, a citizen with lower secondary education and three training courses will appear five times in this view. This table contains 21,970 rows corresponding to studies of 8,289 different citizens.\n(c) DS3. This dataset includes personal and aggregated data of all the citizens considered. It contains one row for each of the 120,927 citizens that appear in the two previous views.\n(d) DS4. This dataset includes the contract history for each citizen. It contains one row for each contract held by the 120,927 citizens. This table contains 820,985 rows. It should be noted that the number of contracts differs significantly between citizens with and without training courses. Thus, out of the 8,289 citizens with training courses, 8,151 appear at least once with a contract, whereas 138 do not. Conversely, of the total of 112,638 citizens without training courses, 67,253 appear at least once with a contract, whereas 45,385 do not."}, {"title": "3.2 Courses", "content": "For this study, 113 training courses offered by Extremadura's employment service (SEXPE) in Spain were considered.

Finally, we discuss how to assess the impact of a training course according to multiple criteria. The methodology is summarized in four stages, as shown in Figure 1."}, {"title": "4.1 Working life curves", "content": "We define the WLC of person i in the database as a function WLC\u1d62: [0, T\u2098\u2090\u2093] \u2192 [0, 1] that assigns to each day t of the working life of person i the quotient between the number of days that a person has been employed and the number of days spanned since the beginning of their working life. That is, if N(t) is the number of days under employment until day t, then we have the following:\nWLC(t) = N(t)/t, t = 1, 2, ...\n(1)\nWhen constructing the WLC, two points are convenient to emphasise:\n\u2022 Determination of the date of origin of working life. Normally, the beginning of working life is defined as the earliest between the start date of the first labour contract and the end date of the last regular study taken (not including the possible SEXPE training courses taken).\n\u2022 In many cases, the end date of a contract is not recorded and appears in the database as NULL. More than 25% of the contracts do not have an appropriately assigned end date. Therefore, a mechanism to assign an end date to the contract must be established."}, {"title": "4.2 Definition of the control group", "content": "The next step is to compare the WLC of person p\u1d62 who has completed a particular training course with that of other people who have not. In particular, we want to determine whether from the completion of a course, at instance t\u1d62 (measured in days), the working life of an individual improves in horizon h, that is, in the interval [t\u1d62, t\u1d62 + h], when compared with a group of people who did not take that course and, up to moment t\u1d62, had a labour behaviour similar to that of the individual in question.\nAssume that from a course C\u2c7c under study, we take an individual p\u1d62 who has taken the course at instance t\u1d62 (measured in days since the beginning of his or her working life). Note that, in addition to t\u1d62, for each person in the database, we know the sex, age and educational level at each instance. The control group for p\u1d62 (denoted CG\u1d62) is obtained in three stages.\nFirst, we filter the database by considering only individuals of the same sex as p\u1d62, age within 5 years of the age of p\u1d62, the same educational level at time t\u1d62 as person p\u1d62, and working life at least as long as that of p\u1d62 plus horizon h (in days).

The potential group was then ordered in increasing order.\nWe then proceeded to find the final control groups by k-means clustering and determined the optimal number of clusters using the GAP statistic.

It is worth noting that individual scores were, in general terms, quite extreme. Notably, they were either close to 1 or close to 0. Hence, the performance of a course at a certain criterion was highly and positively correlated to the percentage of students of that course that would have not passed a t-test at a standard significance level (e.g. 5% or 10%).\nAs shown in Figure 7, criteria C2 and C3 were rarely met by respondents. The C2 criterion ('total number of days with a permanent contract') is very restrictive in Spain and even more so in regions such as Extremadura, where employment is characterised by high levels of temporary employment. Therefore, the results obtained for different courses under criterion C2 were as expected.\nIn contrast, the poor performance results for criterion C3 ('number of days in a position related to the course taken'), provided us some useful information. The fact that the results for this criterion were also very poor indicates that, in general, SEXPE training courses do not provide specific training relevant to the Extremaduran labour market."}, {"title": "5.3 Course ranking", "content": "Once the different alternatives were evaluated for each of the four criteria and the performance matrix was obtained, we ranked them using the uwTOPSIS method described above. In this case, we used l\u2c7c = 0.1 and u\u2c7c = 0.6 for j = 1,..., 4 as the lower and upper bounds for different criteria, respectively. The rationale behind this selection of limits is twofold. Firstly, the wide range of values reduces the influence of subjective decision-making. Secondly, the ranges must be sufficiently narrow to exclude situations in which some weights approach 0 or 1. In such cases, significant issues may arise during the decision-making process. In the former case, a criterion can be eliminated; in the latter case, the problem is no longer multi-criteria."}, {"title": "5.4 Sensitivity analysis", "content": "One of the main advantages of using uwTOPSIS over other weighted methods is that, in the absence of expert information, the decision maker only has to provide some rough lower and upper limits for the weights of each criterion, thus decreasing subjectivity during the decision-making process. However, this does not mean that the results are free from subjec- tivity because they depend on the upper and lower limits defined above and on the value of parameter k\u2081, which defines the inclination of the decision maker towards one extreme or the other of the interval obtained by uwTOPSIS in equation (6), and whose usual value is k\u2081 = 0.5. It is thus important to analyse the effect that changing the definition of these parameters has on both the uwTOPSIS score and final ranking.\nTo this end, we conducted a simple analysis starting from the values of the parameters used in the previous section (i.e. l\u2c7c = 0.1 and u\u2c7c = 0.6, for j = 1,...,4, and k\u2081 = 0.5). We varied these values to a certain extent and measured the difference between the obtained and original solutions. It is essential to carefully consider and maintain objectivity when determining the degree of uncertainty to be assigned to the input factors (in our case, the criteria weights or the parameter k\u2081) to assess the variance of the output (i.e. score or the position in the ranking). If the degree of variation attributed to input factors is excessive, the model exhibits an unacceptable degree of variability, rendering it ineffective (Leamer, 1983). In accordance with the methodology proposed by other authors, such as Annoni and Kozovska (2010), the parameters were varied within the following range: l\u2c7c \u2208 [0.05, 0.15], u\u2c7c \u2208 [0.55, 0.65] for j = 1, . . ., 4, and k\u2081 \u2208 [0.3, 0.7].\nTo analyse the variability of the results, three different measures were used. These in- cluded the mean absolute percentage difference, which was used to measure the difference in uwTOPSIS scores, and the Kendall-tau distance and average ranking position difference, which were used to measure the difference between the rankings produced by uwTOPSIS."}, {"title": "6 Conclusions", "content": "In this study, we proposed a methodology to analyse the effect of the performance of a certain activity (training courses) on a population. The proposed methodology is completely data- driven (contrary to many studies on the same topic, which are based on opinion surveys), and bottom-up. In particular, the proposed methodology starts by analysing the performance of each participant who took a course. Then, these performances can be aggregated to define the performance of the given course. Finally, courses are ordered using the uwTOPSIS method.\nThe control group was selected based on the definition of the WLC, which parameterises the working life of individuals and allows comparisons with other subjects. In this way, by means of a clustering process, we can define the control group with which to compare the results of each participant who took each course. This novel methodology permits the defini- tion of control groups in experiments that use pre-existing databases, which can be expanded over a long period of time with heterogeneous individuals. Nevertheless, it requires access to a substantial quantity of data from disparate databases that must be cross-referenced. This requires significant collaboration and coordination between the various institutions.\nWith regard to the proposed multi-criteria method, uwTOPSIS has an advantage over other weighted methods. In the absence of expert information, the decision maker should only provide some rough lower and upper limits for the weights of each criterion to reduce subjectivity during the decision-making process. This innovative multi-criteria method can- not be compared with other known multi-criteria techniques because fixed weights are not assigned a priori to the criteria; instead, the upper and lower bounds are set. The develop- ment of other multi-criteria methods with the introduction of weight bounds could prove an interesting avenue for future research, potentially enabling a comparison of the results of this methodology with those of new approaches.\nA sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyse the effect of changing the definition of subjective parameters used in uwTOPSIS on the final score and ranking. This analysis demonstrated the transparency and robustness of the proposed methodology because the observed changes were consistent with the modifications made.\nResults of the multi-criteria uwTOPSIS method demonstrated that training courses re- lated to the professional families of ADM, HOT and CSS have a positive effect on employa- bility and improve the working conditions of citizens.

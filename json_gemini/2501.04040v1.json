These models, exemplified by OpenAI's GPT series and Meta's LLAMA, have revolutionized how we approach natural language processing tasks, achieving comprehension, learning, and generation levels that were once considered unattainable. Their impressive performance spans a variety of tasks, including text generation, question answering, language translation, and summarization, showcasing their potential in tackling intricate language challenges. Surprisingly, these models have also exhibited some abilities that go beyond their primary task of text generation, such as commonsense reasoning, code generation, arithmetic operations, and other complex tasks in various domains.\nSeveral key factors have driven the evolution of LLMs, most notably the exponential growth in available data and computational resources. Indeed, on the one hand, social media platforms, digital libraries, and other sources have provided vast amounts of textual and multimedia information, enabling LLMs to be trained on extensive and diverse datasets. On the other hand, the availability of powerful GPUs, TPUs, and distributed computing frameworks has made it feasible to train models with billions, and even trillions, of parameters. Together, these two factors have led LLMs to capture nuanced linguistic patterns, cultural context, and domain-specific knowledge, enhancing their ability to generate coherent, contextually appropriate, and highly versatile outputs.\nHowever, with their increasing complexity and capabilities, these models have introduced new challenges and raised critical questions about their applicability, limitations, and potential for future development. Questions surrounding their ethical use and long-term impact not only to the AI landscape but also to our own lives have become central to discussions about their future. Addressing these concerns is critical as researchers and practitioners continue to explore the transformative possibilities that LLMs can offer."}, {"title": "1.2 Goals of the paper", "content": "The goal of this paper is twofold.\nWe first aim to provide an in-depth survey on LLMs and their applications, beginning with a foundational overview of their development, pre-training strategies, and architectural variations. This includes an examination of the progression from early language models to the sophisticated architectures of LLMs, such as BERT, GPT, and Llama. In particular, we explore the concept of scaling laws, which have been instrumental in understanding how the size and complexity of LLMs contribute to their performance and capabilities, as well as the trade-offs and challenges associated with building increasingly larger and more powerful models. We will also investigate their application across various domains, such as healthcare, finance, education, law, and scientific research. Each of these domains presents unique challenges and opportunities for LLMs, highlighting the versatility and adaptability of these models. For instance, in healthcare, LLMs have shown promise in assisting with clinical decision-making, while in finance, they are being utilized for tasks such as sentiment analysis and market prediction.\nThe second objective of the present paper is to deepen some of the mechanisms that enable LLMs to perform tasks previously deemed impossible for machine learning systems. In particular, we will try to address some fundamental questions. How do these models learn and generalize across tasks and domains? What are these emergent abilities, and how can they be elicited? Which factors contribute to their development (e.g., model size, data, architecture)? What are the inherent limitations of these models and how can they be addressed?"}, {"title": "1.3 Content and organization", "content": "Below, is a summary of the paper organized by its structure.\n\u2022 Section 2 introduces LLMs, tracing their development from early statistical language models to modern transformer-based architectures. It underscores the significant role of the scaling law in LLM development, where increasing model size, data volume, and computational resources leads to substantial performance enhancements across a wide range of language tasks. The section also illustrates prominent LLM families like BERT, T5, GPT series, and LLaMA, highlighting their distinctive architectures, strengths, and contributions to the advancement of natural language processing. Additionally, it emphasizes the transformative impact of LLMs across various domains, including healthcare, finance, education, law, and scientific research.\n\u2022 Section 3 focuses on the fundamental building blocks of LLMs, covering data preprocessing techniques, pre-training methodologies, and model adaptation strategies. It explores various pre-training approaches, including unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised learning, emphasizing their impact on model performance and adaptability. The section also examines different data sources used in LLM training, categorizing them into general data like Web pages, books, and conversation text, specialized data such as scientific literature and code, and widely used datasets like Wikipedia, BookCorpus, and CommonCrawl. It details the critical data preprocessing steps, such as quality filtering, data cleaning, deduplication, and tokenization, and their role in preparing data for effective LLM training. Moreover, it discusses model adaptation techniques like instruction tuning and alignment tuning, which fine-tune models for specific tasks and align their behaviour with desired human values. Crucially, the section provides a comprehensive analysis of the Transformer architecture, the dominant framework for modern LLMs, detailing its components (encoder, decoder, self-attention mechanisms), normalization methods, activation functions, positional embeddings, and optimization strategies.\n\u2022 Section 4 addresses the effective strategies and techniques for utilizing LLMs, emphasizing in-context learning (ICL), chain-of-thought prompting (CoT), and planning capabilities. It explains ICL as a unique prompting technique that empowers LLMs to learn from examples presented within the prompt, allowing them to tackle new tasks without requiring explicit gradient updates. It elaborates on various ICL strategies, such as demonstration design, prompt engineering, and the selection of appropriate scoring functions, while also exploring the factors influencing ICL performance. It then introduces CoT prompting as a powerful method for enhancing LLM reasoning abilities. This involves integrating intermediate reasoning steps within the prompt, guiding the model to adopt a structured thought process, particularly beneficial for tasks requiring logical deduction, problem-solving, and mathematical calculations. Finally, the section explores the planning capabilities of LLMs, focusing on prompt-based planning. This technique involves decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks and generating a plan of action for execution. Different planning approaches, including text-based and programmatic methods, are discussed and the critical role of feedback and plan refinement mechanisms in achieving successful plan execution is highlighted.\n\u2022 Section 5 investigates the origins of CoT capabilities in LLMs, exploring the hypothesis that the presence of code in pre-training data may contribute to the emergence of these reasoning abilities. For this, it presents empirical evidence obtained from experiments conducted on publicly available Llama family models using LMStudio software on the HuggingFace platform. The analysis focuses on the performance of these models on reasoning tasks derived from the GSM8k and gsm-hard datasets, evaluating their capabilities in utilizing CoT and Program of Thought (PoT) approaches.\n\u2022 Finally, section 6 summarizes the key points of the paper, reiterating the transformative potential of LLMs across diverse fields. It also acknowledges the existing ethical, technical, and practical challenges associated with LLM development and advocates for continued research to ensure their responsible and beneficial application in the future."}, {"title": "2 Large Language Models", "content": "At their core, LLMs are designed to comprehend, learn, and generate coherent and contextually relevant language on an unparalleled scale.\nHistorically, the development of Language Models (LMs) has been rooted in the quest to understand and replicate human language, and four main stages can be identified:\n1.

These models were a significant leap forward in the development of language models, representing a shift from word sequencing to learning representation."}, {"title": "2.2 Scaling Law", "content": "The Scaling Law in LLMs constitutes a fundamental principle underlining their development and performance. At its essence, the scaling law posits that as language models increase in size, their capabilities and performance on linguistic tasks exhibit disproportionately positive growth. This concept has become a guiding force in pushing the boundaries of language processing and understanding.\nAs LLMS scale up in terms of parameters, encompassing tens or hundreds of billions, or even trillions, they demonstrate an unprecedented ability to generalise from diverse datasets and generate contextually coherent text. The essence of the scaling law lies in the direct correlation between the size of a language model and the number of parameters it encompasses. Parameters are the internal variables the model learns during training, representing the connections and weights defining its understanding of language. As the number of parameters increases, so does the model's capacity to encapsulate complex linguistic structures.\nOne primary outcome of adhering to the scaling law is the substantial improvement in performance across a spectrum of language-related tasks. From language generation to sentiment analysis, question-answering, and summarization, larger models consistently outperform their smaller counterparts. The increased capacity for learning intricate language features enables LLMs to excel in understanding and producing more human-like text.\nWhen writing, most of the LLMs are based on the transformer architecture, where multi-headed self-attention layers are stacked in a very deep neural network. We'll dive deep into the transformer architecture in Section 3.5.4, but for now, we can say that self-attention is a mechanism that allows a model to weigh different parts of the input sequence differently, capturing dependencies between words. The multi-headed self-attention mechanism lets the model capture different dependencies and relationships between words, enhancing language understanding. The idea is that different attention heads can focus on different aspects or relationships within the data, allowing the model to capture more nuanced patterns. Multiple layers of these multi-headed self-attention mechanisms are stacked in a very deep neural network. Each layer in the stack processes the previous layer's output, learning hierarchical representations of the input data and capturing increasingly complex relationships and abstractions.\nTwo representative scaling laws for Transformer-based LLMs are the following [93, 172]:\n1. KM scaling law: named in this way in Zhao et al. [364] and proposed by the OpenAI team in Kaplan et al. [93]. Given model size M, dataset size D, amount of training compute C, and a compute budget c, the KM scaling law states that the performance of a language model scales as per the following three formulas:\n $L(N) = (N/N_e)^{\\alpha_N}, \\alpha_N \\approx 0.076, N_c \\approx 8.8 \\times 10^{13}$\n $L(D) = (D/D_e)^{-\\alpha_D}, \\alpha_D \\approx 0.095, D_c \\approx 5.4 \\times 10^{13}$\n $L(C) = (C/C_e)^{-\\alpha_C}, \\alpha_C \\approx 0.050, C_c \\approx 3.1 \\times 10^8$ (1)\nwhere L(N), L(D), and L(C) denote the cross-entropy loss of the model, the dataset, and the amount of training computed, respectively. The three laws were formulated by analysing the model's performance across a range of data sizes (from 22M to 23B tokens), model sizes (from 768M to 1.5B non-embedding parameters), and training compute, with certain assumptions (e.g., ensuring that the other two factors do not constrain the analysis of one factor). The findings demonstrated a robust interdependence among the three factors influencing model performance.\n2. Chinchilla scaling law: An alternative form of the scaling law has been proposed by the Google DeepMind team in Hoffmann et al. [172] experimenting with an extensive range of model size (70M to 16B) and data sizes (5B to 500B tokens). The Chinchilla scaling law posits that the performance of a language model scales as per the following formula:\n $L(N, D) = E + \\frac{A}{N^{\\alpha}} + \\frac{B}{D^{\\beta}}$ (2)\nwhere E = 1.69, A = 406.4, B = 410.7, \u03b1 = 0.34, \u03b2 = 0.28\nAuthors showed that optimal allocation of compute budget to model size and data size can be derived as follows 13.\n $N_{opt}(C) = G(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta})C, D_{opt}(C) = G^{-1}(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta})C$, (3)\nwhere a = \u03b1/\u03b1+\u03b2, b = \u03b2/\u03b1+\u03b2 and G is a scaling coefficient. The KM scaling law favours a more significant budget allocation in model size than the data size. In contrast, the Chinchilla scaling law argues that the two sizes should be increased in equal scales [172] (i.e., having similar values for a and b in (3))."}, {"title": "2.3 Prominent Model Families", "content": "The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been driven by the emergence of prominent model families, each characterised by its unique architecture and capabilities. These model families have played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of language processing and understanding and have been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of LLMs.\nSome of the most prominent large language models (having a size larger than 10B) are depicted in Figure 3."}, {"title": "2.3.1 BERT", "content": "Introduced by Google in 2018, BERT [65] marked a significant evolution in LLMs by focusing on bidirectional context in text processing. BERT's model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original transformer architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. [334]. Unlike its predecessors, BERT analyses text in both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left), providing a more nuanced understanding of language context. This bi-directionality enables BERT to achieve state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, such as question answering, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. BERT's architecture and training methodology have influenced numerous subsequent models and research initiatives [65].\nEven BERT is built on the transformer architecture [334], which relies heavily on attention mechanisms to understand the context of words in a sentence. The innovation in BERT is its bidirectional nature and the use of a mechanism called the Masked Language Model (MLM).\nIn MLM, some percentage of the input tokens are randomly masked, and the objective is to predict these masked tokens based on their context, leveraging information from both sides of the sequence. BERT also incorporates a next-sentence prediction (NSP) task that helps the model learn relationships between sentences, further enhancing its understanding of context.\nBERT's bidirectional context understanding significantly improves its performance on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition. By pre-training on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuning on specific tasks, BERT can adapt to various domains with relatively little task-specific data, demonstrating impressive transfer learning capabilities. Its architecture has set a new standard in the field, inspiring many subsequent models that build on or modify its foundational structure.\nDespite its strengths, BERT is not without limitations. The model's size and complexity require substantial computational resources for training, which can be a barrier for some organisations or researchers. BERT's focus on context from surrounding text does not inherently solve all challenges in language understanding, particularly concerning ambiguity, nuance, or the subtleties of human language. The model can sometimes struggle with tasks requiring extensive world knowledge or reasoning beyond the scope of its training data.\nWhile BERT itself does not exhibit emergent abilities in the same way that scaling up GPT models does, its architecture has enabled new approaches to handling context and language understanding that were not feasible with prior models. Subsequent iterations and variations of BERT, like RoBERTa15 and ALBERT16, have sought to optimise and expand upon BERT's foundational principles, exploring how changes in model size, training methodology, and architecture can influence performance and capabilities."}, {"title": "2.3.2 T5", "content": "Developed by Google in 2019, T5 17 re-framed all NLP tasks as a unified text-to-text problem, where every task is cast as generating text from input text. This approach simplifies using a single model across diverse tasks, encouraging a more generalised understanding of language.\nT5 demonstrated its prowess across a range of benchmarks, setting new standards in the field of NLP [99]. It's built on the transformer model, similar to its predecessors, BERT and GPT. It leverages the effective self-attention mechanism for processing data sequences. The model is designed to handle various tasks without needing task-specific architectural modifications. It uses a unified text-to-text framework, where tasks are converted into a format where the input and output are always text strings. T5 is pre-trained on a multitask mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks, utilising a large-scale dataset known as \u201cC4\u201d 18.\nT5's approach simplifies integrating new tasks into the model's training regime, as they only need to be reformulated into the text-to-text format. While T5's unified approach offers considerable advantages, it might not be optimal for all types of tasks. Some tasks could potentially benefit from more specialised model architectures or formats. The training process for T5 is resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational power, which could be a limiting factor for smaller organisations or independent researchers. As with other large language models, T5's outputs can sometimes include biases in the training data, necessitating careful monitoring and potential post-hoc adjustments."}, {"title": "2.3.3 GPT Series", "content": "Developed by OpenAI, the GPT series has been at the forefront of LLM research. The original GPT model, introduced in 2018, laid the groundwork with its transformer-based architecture, significantly improving previous models' understanding of context and generating text. It was developed based on a generative, decoder-only Transformer architecture, and it adopted a hybrid approach of unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.\nGPT-2 [75], released in 2019, expanded on this with 1.5 billion parameters and was trained with a large webpage dataset, WebText, demonstrating unprecedented text generation capabilities.\nThe subsequent GPT-3 model, unveiled in 2020, further pushed the boundaries with 175 billion parameters, showcasing remarkable abilities in generating human-like text, performing language translation, question-answering, and more without task-specific training. In the research paper on GPT-3 [88], the authors explained the concept known as in-context learning (ICL). This approach enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to function in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. ICL empowers LLMs to comprehend tasks when they are described using natural language. This method aligns LLMs' pre-training and application phases under a unified framework. During pre-training, the model predicts subsequent text sequences based on the prior context. In contrast, during in-context learning, the model generates the appropriate solution to a task in the form of a text sequence using the provided task instructions and examples.\nThe GPT series is based on the transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. [334]. This architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to process input data, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words within the input context, enhancing its ability to understand and generate language. GPT models are characterized by their stacked transformer blocks, which consist of multi-headed self-attention layers followed by fully connected feed-forward neural networks. The series has seen an exponential increase in the number of parameters: GPT with 110 million, GPT-2 with 1.5 billion, and GPT-3 with 175 billion parameters.\nGPT models exhibit a remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, simulating human-like writing styles. They demonstrate strong performance in a wide array of NLP tasks without task-specific data training, showcasing their versatility in few-shot, one-shot, or zero-shot learning scenarios.

Main differences between Llama and original Transformer architecture [334] are the following:\n1. Pre-normalization27 Llama uses pre-normalization 28, which means that the normaliza-tion layer is placed before the self-attention and feed-forward layers. Pre-normalization has improved training stability and convergence in large language models, making it a popular choice for many state-of-the-art models.\n2. SwiGLU activation function29 LLAMA uses the SwiGLU30 activation function by Shazeer [100], which is a variant of the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) activation function. SwiGLU has been shown to improve the performance of large language models by enhancing the flow of information through the network.\n3. Rotary Embeddings31 Llama uses rotary embeddings by Su et al.

[334], optimized to deliver state-of-the-art performance with a fraction of the parameter count typically seen in large language models (LLMs). Notable enhancements include the adoption of Multi-Query Attention, RoPE embeddings, GeGLU activations, and RMSNorm, indicating an evolution of the original transformer architecture.

The design philosophy targets efficient deployment across diverse hardware platforms, including but not limited to mobile devices, laptops, desktop computers, and servers.\nIn comparative benchmarks, Gemma models have demonstrated capabilities that exceed those of larger parameter models, such as Llama 2 (13B), indicating a significant efficiency in parameter utilization. Improvements are particularly evident in language understanding and reasoning tasks where Gemma models have been pitted against their contemporaries.\nOne prominent strength of Gemma models is their deployment efficiency, which democratizes access to state-of-the-art NLP tools.

It shows marked improvements in log-ical and mathematical reasoning, outperforming prior versions on benchmarks. The model is capable of writing, debugging, and explaining code snippets. It is optimized for dialogues and interactive workflows, allowing for dynamic and iterative engagement with users.\nClaude 3 has demonstrated significant improvements in its ability to perform logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Logical reasoning, in particular, showcases the model's ability to deduce patterns, validate arguments, and resolve abstract puzzles. For example, tasks involving syllogistic reasoning or the identification of valid logical structures benefit from the model's enhanced understanding of formal rules.\nIn mathematical reasoning, the model has shown its ability to parse and solve complex problems across multiple steps. Benchmarks such as GSM8K, which contains grade-school-level arithmetic and word problems, highlight Claude 3's ability to provide structured and accurate solutions. The model can further engage in higher-level mathematics, including algebra and basic calculus, as evaluated by the MATH dataset, though challenges remain in more specialized domains.\nBeyond formal reasoning, Claude 3 excels in commonsense understanding, a critical aspect of human-like intelligence. Benchmarks such as CommonSenseQA and PIQA demonstrate its ability to reason about everyday scenarios and physical phenomena, respectively. These capabilities are crucial for applications that require intuitive decision-making, such as virtual assistants or educational tools.\nClaude 3's ethical reasoning is a particularly interesting facet. Leveraging training paradigms focused on safety and alignment, the model is adept at identifying and addressing ethical dilemmas. Benchmarks like the Winogender Schema, which tests gender bias, and other ethical reasoning tests confirm the model's ability to minimize bias and generate responsible outputs.\nDespite its strengths, Claude 3 is not without limitations. Contextual understanding can falter in multi-layered or ambiguously phrased tasks. Similarly, abstract reasoning outside the bounds of its training data can present significant hurdles. Another limitation arises in the handling of uncertainty; the model can occasionally overcommit to answers even when the underlying confidence is low. These challenges underscore the need for further improvements, particularly in domains requiring highly abstract thinking or multi-turn contextual reasoning. Integrating enhanced memory mechanisms may help the model process longer or more complex contexts, thereby reducing errors and improving overall coherence.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet shows substantial enhancements in both logical and commonsense rea-soning. This improvement is particularly evident in graduate-level problem-solving tasks and other advanced reasoning benchmarks, such as the ARC dataset. The model demonstrates a better ability to:\n\u2022 Parse complex, multi-step problems and provide structured solutions.\n\u2022 Handle abstract reasoning with improved accuracy in scenarios involving nuanced logical patterns or uncommon use cases.\nComparing this version to its predecessors Claude 3 and Claude 3 Opus, the advancements in Claude 3.5 Sonnet are clear:\n\u2022 On reasoning benchmarks, Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves higher accuracy, particularly in tests like GSM8K and MATH datasets.\n\u2022 Interaction speeds are significantly faster, improving usability in real-time applications.\n\u2022 Its coding capabilities surpass earlier versions in complexity and versatility, reflecting deeper training on software development datasets."}, {"title": "2.4 Specialized Large Language Models", "content": "Specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) are model checkpoints refined for particular fields or tasks, such as healthcare and finance.

Central to these advancements are Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been instrumental in catalyzing transformative changes across the healthcare sector:\n1. Medical image analysis: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated with medical imaging technologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. By analyzing radiological images and clinical reports, LLMs can assist radiologists in interpreting images, identifying abnormalities, and providing diagnostic insights. These models leverage their natural language processing capabilities to extract information from textual reports and correlate it with visual data, thereby augmenting the diagnostic process [120, 140].\n2. Clinical Decision Support: LLMs have been pivotal in augmenting clinical decision support systems (CDSS). By analyzing patient data and medical literature, LLMs assist clinicians in diagnosing conditions, suggesting treatment options, and predicting patient outcomes. For instance, models like BERT and its derivatives have been fine-tuned on medical corpora, yielding tools that can parse clinical notes, interpret lab results, and provide evidence-based recommendations [61].\n3. Medical Documentation and Coding: The onus of medical documentation and billing has traditionally been a significant administrative burden for healthcare providers. LLMs have demonstrated the ability to streamline these processes by automating the translation of clinical dialogue and notes into structured electronic health records (EHRs) and accurately coding medical procedures, thus mitigating errors and saving time [53].\n4. Drug Discovery and Development: In the domain of pharmaceuticals, LLMs have expedited the drug discovery and development pipelines. By mining through vast chemical libraries and medical databases, these models facilitate the identification of potential drug candidates and the repurposing of existing drugs for new therapeutic uses [84].\n5. Personalized Medicine: Personalized medicine, which tailors treatment to individual patient characteristics, has benefited from LLMs by generating patient-specific models that predict disease susceptibility and drug response. This personalization extends to creating tailored health interventions based on patient history and genetic information [15].\n6. Patient Engagement and Self-Management: LLMs are also revolutionizing patient engagement by powering intelligent virtual health assistants capable of providing information, reminders, and motivational support for chronic disease self-management.

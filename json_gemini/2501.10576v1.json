This open-source project contains both Python libraries and computational essays (Jupyter notebooks) that together are designed to allow a diverse audience with little or no background in AI to interact with a variety of AI tools, exploring in more depth how they function, visualizing their outcomes, and gaining a better understanding of their ethical implications. These notebooks have been piloted at multiple institutions in a variety of humanities courses centered on the theme of responsible AI. In addition, we conducted usability testing of AITK. Our pilot studies and usability testing results indicate that AITK is easy to navigate and effective at helping users gain a better understanding of AI. Our goal, in this time of rapid innovations in AI, is for AITK to provide an accessible resource for faculty from any discipline looking to incorporate AI topics into their courses and for anyone eager to learn more about AI on their own.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Al's impact on society is at an all time high. The One Hundred Year Study on AI states that \"the field's successes have led to an inflection point: it is now urgent to think seriously about the downsides and risks that the broad application of AI is revealing\" (Littman et al. 2021, p. 71). Furthermore, the report argues that the AI research community has a crucial role to play, sharing \u201cimportant trends and findings with the public in informative and actionable ways, free of hype and clear about the dangers and unintended consequences along with the opportunities and benefits\u201d (Littman et al. 2021, p. 71).\nCurrently, a number of excellent resources exist to help explain AI, including blogs such as Janelle Shane's AI Weirdness (Shane 2016) and YouTube channels such as Grant Sanderson's 3BluelBrown (Grant Sanderson 2015). Also there are numerous toolkits to help build AI such as the Open-Source AI Cookbook (Hugging Face 2024), Fast AI (fast.ai 2024) and Machine Learning Complete (Nyandwi 2023). What is novel about the AITK project with respect to these existing resources and tools? Let's begin by describing AITK.\nAITK consists of both a set of Python libraries and a set of Jupyter notebooks. The Python libraries are designed to make it easy to experiment with key AI frameworks such as deep learning and robotics. The code focuses on allowing users to visualize the inner workings of these frameworks, opening up the black box. For example, when building a neural network, users can display the network's structure and visualize the network's activations across all layers based on any desired input values. But how can novices utilize these tools without knowing how to program? The Jupyter notebooks provide a way for novices to interact with this code without having to write it themselves. A notebook consists of a series of cells, where each cell contains either executable code or formatted text. These notebooks enable users to interactively execute and modify prewritten code, interspersed with accompanying explanation, allowing them to gain a richer understanding of AI and how it functions. One can think of Jupyter notebooks as essentially computational essays, and they have transformed the way science is now communicated (Perkel 2021).\nOur aim with the AITK project is to provide a resource for better understanding AI and its risks that is free, open-source, accessible to novices, and fundamentally interactive. Blogs and YouTube channels provide informative analysis of AI, but they lack the ability for users to try out the concepts on their own. Existing educational toolkits, including those using Jupyter notebooks, are generally about teaching users to build their own AI and so require substantial coding ability. As a result, they are not well-suited for novices, or for those mainly wishing to become better informed about AI. The AITK project bridges the gap between explanations and experimentation, by providing both together as computational essays that were written with novices in mind.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the types of computational essays that are available in AITK, and provide details about one example notebook. Next, we discuss how AITK has already been piloted at a number of different institutions in humanities courses focused on the theme of responsible AI. Then we describe how AITK can help address the new focus of Computer Science curricula on the societal impacts of AI. Because our goal is that AITK should be accessible to anyone, we also conducted usability testing and describe both the design and results of this testing. Based on the results, we reflect on ways"}, {"title": "2 Description of AITK", "content": "AITK began as a collaborative effort between three computer science faculty members, Douglas Blank, James Marshall, and Lisa Meeden, built on many years of experience teaching AI at small liberal arts colleges, and based on several previously created open source projects (Blank et al. 2006; O'Hara, Blank, and Marshall 2015). It was released as an open source project on GitHub\u00b9 in 2021. It underwent significant additions and upgrades in 2024 with the help of three undergraduate students (all co-authors on this paper).\nThe notebooks within AITK are organized into three main categories: Neural Networks, Generative AI, and Robotics. There is also an Advanced category that is most appropriate for users with a deeper background in computer science and AI. \nBecause neural networks and deep learning are the foundation of much of the latest innovations in AI, we recommend beginning with the Neural Networks category, and specifically with the notebook Basic Neural Networks, which fo-"}, {"title": "3 Piloted in Humanities Courses", "content": "Starting in 2021, the National Humanities Center brought together faculty from fifteen institutions to develop courses to engage students on their respective campuses to think more deeply about the ethical issues surrounding AI. This initiative was called the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Curriculum Design Project (National Humanities Center 2021).\nThe cohort of faculty spent two years developing new humanities courses and offered them for the first time during the 2023-24 academic year.\nNotebooks from AITK were piloted in a subset of these courses: those developed at Bowdoin College, Davidson College, Duke University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Utah. All of these courses used the Basic Neural Networks notebook described earlier. Each faculty member downloaded a copy of the AITK notebook to Google Co-lab, making it easy for them to customize the notebook for their needs, elaborating on or removing the existing material.\nThen students made their own copies of the faculty member's notebook and also ran them in Google Colab. The requirements to using one of these notebooks in a course is relatively lightweight: students must have a Google account and a laptop with a web browser. During these pilot studies all students were able to successfully use and complete the notebooks.\nLet's look more closely at one of these course entitled Ethics and Technology, co-developed and co-taught by a Computer Scientist and a Philosopher (Meeden and Thomason 2024) at Swarthmore College. The prerequisite for this course was an introductory course in either Computer Science or Philosophy, leading to a diverse mix of student backgrounds. Students were expected to write philosophy papers, and to complete labs related to AI, where the labs were based largely on AITK notebooks. Initially, the CS students were nervous about the papers, while the Philosophy students were worried about the labs.\nThis course began with primers on both ethics and AI. The notebook Basic Neural Networks was used during the AI primer. Throughout the semester, the students read chapters from Kate Crawford's book Atlas of AI (Crawford 2022).\nThe notebook Categorizing Faces was used to illustrate concepts from her chapters entitled \u201cClassification\" and \"Affect\". Other readings were also included to delve into additional topics not covered by Crawford. For example, we discussed embodiment and read Thomas Nagel's well-known paper What is it like to be a bat? (Nagel 1974) and paired this with the AITK notebook What is it like to be a robot?.\nIn the final course evaluations, students were asked \"How did the lab component of the course complement your understanding of the course's content?\" Here is a sample of their responses:"}, {"title": "4 Highlighting Societal Impacts of AI", "content": "Approximately every 10 years the ACM and IEEE, the primary professional organizations of computer science, issue updated curricular recommendations for undergraduate CS education. The most recent update, called CS2023, \"highlights how important it is to understand and assess the broader societal impacts and implications of AI methods and applications, including issues in AI ethics, fairness, trust, and explainability\" (Eaton and Epstein 2024). To reflect this, a new core knowledge unit has been added entitled \"Applications and Societal Impact\" with a suggested 3 hours of instruction.\nWe believe that a number of AITK notebooks offer an excellent resource for helping to meet these requirements. For example the following notebooks focus on the societal impacts of AI:\nData Manipulation Examines how the relative numbers within each class of a data set biases the outcomes. It highlights the \"Gender Shades\" work that revealed biases in facial recognition software (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018).\nWord Embedding Describes how word embeddings are formed and discusses how they learn biases implicit in training texts such as the association of particular careers with a specific gender (Bolukbasi et al. 2016).\nImage Generation Explains the process of image generation and concludes by revealing the biases that emerge in generated images, for example in typical skin tones produced for the prompt \u201clawyer\u201d vs the prompt \"criminal\u201d (Nicoletti and Bass 2023)."}, {"title": "5 Usability Study", "content": "We had two goals in conducting the study. Our first goal was to observe how new users to AITK were able to navigate the GitHub website in order to find a notebook of interest to them. To this end, our user testing facilitators were trained by our UX Librarian who provided various materials to prepare them, such as (Blakiston 2024). Our second goal was to assess the value of our notebooks as educational tools.\nWe recruited a total of 17 participants who were divided into three groups based on their experience level with CS and GitHub. We had 6 novice users who had never used GitHub and only one of whom had taken an introductory CS course. We had 6 intermediate users who had used GitHub and had taken at least one intermediate CS course. We had 5 experienced users, three were CS or math majors with several upper-level CS courses or some other relevant AI/ML experience and two were CS faculty members.\nThe usability test lasted for at most one hour and participants received a $25 gift card for their time. Their task was described by the facilitator as follows:\nWe'll be doing a website usability session: I'll describe some situations for which information from the toolkit will be helpful and you'll explore the toolkit to look for it. We'll be testing the toolkit\u2014not you\u2014in order to see if the toolkit is intuitive to use. It will help us to watch you navigate, especially if you are not able to find information, because that will tell us how to make the toolkit easier to use. Here is a topic to explore. Go through any notebooks necessary to gain knowledge in this topic.\nThe landing page of the AITK website contains a link to a short summary of the notebook topics and another link to our suggested sequencing through the notebooks. Some participants read the summary and sequencing information first"}, {"title": "6 Conclusions", "content": "In this paper we described the Artificial Intelligence Toolkit (known as AITK), an open-source project consisting of both Python libraries and Jupyter notebooks. Our goal for this project is to provide a resource for better understanding AI that is free, accessible to novices, and fundamentally interactive. We argued that though many other resources exists for exploring AI, they are either too advanced for novices, or are simply explanations, with no opportunity for interaction.\nAITK bridges the gap between experimentation and explanation by providing both components together within computational essays that were written with novices in mind. To illustrate this, we provided details on one notebook that introduces users to key concepts related to neural networks and machine learning.\nNext, we described how AITK has been successfully piloted in humanities courses developed around the theme of responsible AI at a number of institutions involved in a National Humanities Center initiative. The fact that humanities students, who for the most part had no computer science background, were able to successfully use these notebooks demonstrates that they are accessible to novices. We argued, that AITK could also help computer science faculty address the latest ACM/IEEE curriculum requirements for a new core knowledge unit that focuses on AI applications and their societal impacts. We noted that AITK is a lightweight addition to any course, only requiring students to have a Google account, and a laptop with a web browser to be able to run the notebooks within Google Colab. Finally, we conducted a usability study of AITK with a mix of novice, intermediate, and advanced participants. Results were overwhelmingly positive, though our observations revealed that there are still ways to improve the toolkit by providing additional scaffolding for novices."}]}

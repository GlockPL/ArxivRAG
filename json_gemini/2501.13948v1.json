{"title": "Longitudinal Abuse and Sentiment Analysis of Hollywood Movie Dialogues using LLMS", "authors": ["Rohitash Chandra", "Guoxiang Ren", "Group-Ha"], "abstract": "Over the past decades, there has been an increasing concern about the prevalence of abusive and violent content in Hollywood movies. This study uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the longitudinal abuse and sentiment analysis of Hollywood Oscar and blockbuster movie dialogues from 1950 to 2024. By employing fine-tuned LLMs, we analyze subtitles for over a thousand movies categorised into four genres to examine the trends and shifts in emotional and abusive content over the past seven decades. Our findings reveal significant temporal changes in movie dialogues, which reflect broader social and cultural influences. Overall, the emotional tendencies in the films are diverse, and the detection of abusive content also exhibits significant fluctuations. The results show a gradual rise in abusive content in recent decades, reflecting social norms and regulatory policy changes. Genres such as thrillers still present a higher frequency of abusive content that emphasises the ongoing narrative role of violence and conflict. At the same time, underlying positive emotions such as humour and optimism remain prevalent in most of the movies. Furthermore, the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues has been significant over the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters.\nKeywords: Large Language Models, Sentiment Analysis, Abusive Detection, Hollywood, Oscar, Blockbusters, Dialogues", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The cinema has been present in various forms for over a century, serving multiple purposes as an artistic medium through movies and series [1]. Since the age of television [2], the cinema has evolved from a mere source of entertainment to an influential tool that includes politics [3], fashion, and cultural and social changes [4], supporting activism and policy changes, e.g., advocacy for queer activism and same-sex marriage [5]. Furthermore, there has also been activism with movies about climate change [6] including natural disasters (e.g. Day After Tomorrow [7]) and dystopian futures showing a water crisis (e.g. Mad Max [8]).\nThe cinema had profound positive and negative cultural and social effects. Some of the negative impacts are an increase in crime rate [9], such as drug use and distribution [10], and sex crimes [11]. Violence is an important narrative tool for cinema, despite some of its adverse social effects. Violence and abuse in cinema have been used to enhance a viewer's experience, and boost movie profits [12]; therefore, the prevalence of violence in movies has significantly escalated over the past few decades [13]. However, the relationship between movies and human behaviour is of utmost significance [14] and violent movies often have an inciting effect [15]. Violent movies promote aggression and lead to antisocial behaviour [16] that includes aggressive behaviour as well as cognitive, social, and emotional problems, often accompanied by a lack of empathy [17]. The cinema, including movies, series, and documentary media content, has lasting emotional effects on young viewers. Canter et al. [18] reported that different people have different emotional and behavioural reactions to violent movies. Moreover, they reported that children's exposure to cinema and related media can lead to increased fear and anxiety.\nThe way of obtaining entertainment has become more diverse with the Internet and emerging technologies. OTT (Over-the-top) [19] is a digital media platform for film and television content delivered through the Internet. OTT service providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ use a subscription system or pay-per-view to provide users with a huge amount of movie and television resources, which has become an important channel for current entertainment consumption [20]. The future could have OTT platforms gaining the upper hand over traditional movie theatres due to factors, such as diverse content, language availability, ease of viewing, and affordable costs [21]. As OTT platforms become one of the main channels for entertainment, we can also examine the challenges that may arise.\nThe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) [22] lies at the confluence of artificial intelligence and linguistics, involving the design and implementation of algorithms that interact with human language using methods such as deep learning [23]. Over the past few years, the widespread use of deep learning models has propelled NLP, enabling it to deal efficiently with more complex language problems [23]. Large language models (LLMs) [24] are deep learning models with an enormous number of parameters trained in an unsupervised manner using a large corpus of text data [24]. LLMs have demonstrated impressive abilities in NLP tasks [25] such as sentiment analysis, question answering, text summarising, and language translation. Sentiment analysis [26] using deep learning models [27], focuses on detecting human emotions in text such as 'anxious', 'happy', 'optimistic' and sentiment polarity prediction such as"}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "Film as a medium is not only considered one of the most important sources of entertainment, but also a powerful tool for influencing society and culture [43]. Although the themes of love, friendship, and family relationships in films inspire audiences positively, some films with explicit, vulgar, or violent content can negatively impact viewers' psychological well-being [44], affecting children and adolescents [45] . Furthermore, the characteristics of the protagonist, such as justice, wisdom and bravery, have a positive influence on the growth of young people [46].\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) [47] presented a comprehensive study of the impact of media violence on the audience. Most studies show that the relationship between media abuse and \u201creal\u201d abuse is interactive, and the perpetuation and persistence of media violence fuelling a global culture of aggression [48, 49, 50]. The American psychologist, Albert Bandura [51] reported that when people consciously or unconsciously remember and preserve abusive content, and unconsciously activate them when there are setbacks in social interactions. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics [52], television violence accounts for 10 percent of the sources of learning about violent behaviour in children. Vitasari [53] reported that the use of abusive words is now more often used in films. The uninhibited display of emotions is an indication of cultural transformation, resulting in a rise in the utilisation of profane language. Hasibuan [54] contended that many films now often use swearing in dialogues to make them more interesting. Novari [55] reported that characters in movies do not always use swearing to curse but to express their other emotions and feelings in different situations. Baid et al. [56] demonstrated that morphing learn-"}, {"title": "2.1. Cinema: impact on society", "content": "positive, negative, or neutral opinions. Sentiment analysis has extensive applications in different domains, encompassing social media analytics, public sentiment monitoring, product review evaluation, and customer feedback assessment [28, 26].\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) [29] are deep learning models that possess the ability to acquire features and capture long-term dependencies from sequential and time-series data [29]. The Transformer model is a deep learning model that features an encoder-decoder architecture and attention-based mechanism inspired by cognitive science [30]. Although RNNS have been widely used, the introduction of the Transformer model has marked a significant shift in NLP, paving the way for pre-trained large language models. Recent innovations in pre-trained language models, also known as LLMs [31], include BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) [32] and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) [31], which have been prominent in a wide range of NLP tasks with implementations including ChatGPT, GPT-40, Gemini, and Grok [33].\nAbuse detection using NLP and LLMs has been prominent due to the needs of social media, where real-time management of discussions are needed to avoid and limit cyber-bullying. Caselli et al. [34] introduced the Hate-BERT model for abusive content detection, achieving better accuracy in detecting various abusive content categories including offensive content, abusive content, and hateful language. Park et al. [35] introduced three methods: debiased word embeddings, gender swap data augmentation, and fine-tuning with a larger corpus to reduce gender biases in abuse detection. Nobata et al. [36] effectively developed a machine learning-based approach to detect hate speech in online user comments. Mozafari et al. [37] added a Bidirectional-LSTM layer to BERT's architecture to enhance its classification capabilities. Mnassri et al. [38] explored various integrated approaches to improve BERT for hate speech detection, and reported that combining BERT with other deep learning models improved accuracy.\nFurthermore, BERT and GPT use the Transformer model [39] to leverage for different tasks in NLP. GPT uses the previous context information in a text sequence to predict words (i.e., unidirectional), making the model simpler, computationally faster, and more suitable for natural language generation tasks [40]. BERT is specifically designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabelled text, effectively incorporating both the left and right context of a sentence. The pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with a single additional output layer to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various tasks [32]. Therefore, BERT is particularly suitable for this study, as it allows effective sentiment analysis of movie dialogues while detecting violent and abusive content.\nThe defining characteristic of longitudinal analysis lies in the repeated measurements taken on the same individuals or subject o study over time, enabling a direct examination of temporal changes [41]. The primary objective of a longitudinal study is to delineate the dynamics of response variation and identify influential factors [41]. By capturing within-individual changes through multiple assessments, one can effectively examine temporal variations [41]."}, {"title": "2.2. Web series and movies", "content": "Web series [59] is a short-form interstitial content distributed through online platforms. Since the 1990s onwards, with the advent of technological change and the emergence of the new media market, web series have become prominent, splitting the market of limited television and film [60]. During COVID-19, as countries went into embargo and for reasons such as economic depression, it gave online sketches a huge opportunity to grow and expand more widely into the population. Traditional movies have been facing a huge challenge due to OTT platforms, and a study shows that as the length of movies increases, people expect movies released in theatres to be released simultaneously on OTT as well [61]. Therefore, web series have become one of the most popular trends on OTT platforms [62]. However, the content preferences for films and web series are very different. In a related study, Wadhwa et al. [63] conducted sentiment analysis for ten films of different genres as well as ten web series during 2017-2019. The authors accessed Twitter data related to each show was accessed through hashtags and 3000 tweets were counted to determine the sentiment of each web series and categorised into positive and negative sentiment. The results found that horror web series were more popular with viewers than horror films, but comedy, romance and crime films were more popular than web series."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The Oscars (Academy Awards) 1, presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) recognise artistic and technical achievements in movies predominately from the USA (Hollywood) [64]. Historically, the Oscars have nominated various films, including historical dramas, biopics, romances, science fiction, etc. Although the drama category plays a big part in the Academy Awards; horror, comedy and independent films have gradually gained more recognition in recent years with movies such as \"Get Out\" and \"Backstage.\" This diversity allows Oscar-nominated films to represent different periods and audiences' aesthetic tastes [64]. The top 10 blockbuster films at the global box office each year represent the most popular movie genres and themes of the year. These films are often able to attract a large audience and have a wide impact on a global scale. The top 10 blockbuster films consist of genres such as action, science fiction, comedy, and animation, and offer insights into cultural preferences and emotional resonance. The popularity of these films in different cultural contexts reflects the general acceptance of their emotional expressions and scenes of violence. Therefore, we chose to study the subtitles of Oscar-nominated movies and the top 10 movie subtitles at the box office each year from 1950 to 2024. We obtained the top 10 Oscar-nominated and top 10 movies at the global Box Office for 1950 to 2024 from a website known as boxofficemojo 2. We used Opensubtitles\u00b3 to extract the subtitles (dialogues) for the top 10 Oscar-nominated and global Box Office films from 1950 to 2024. Because the number of Oscar-nominated films varies from year to year, we obtained a total of 1026 film subtitles and grouped them by year and genre to analyze changes in violence and abuse content and emotional changes in films through time changes. The dataset is available via Kaggle 4 and also documented in our GitHub repository 5 for this study.\nWe categorise the movies into four broad categories, grouping similar categories into one according to the categories defined by the IMBD (International Movie Database) 6 website to facilitate comparison of different movie categories. We group the categories of action, adventure, and crime as action, and group horror and thriller categories as thrillers. We keep the comedy and drama categories unchanged. Since most movies are defined by three category labels on the IMBD website, we take the first label as the main category of the movie as the basis for classification and report the number of movies under each category in Table 1."}, {"title": "3.1.

Deep learning-based language models", "content": "The LSTM network has had a significant contribution to NLP tasks including machine translation, speech-to-text transcription, and language modelling applications [70, 71]. NLP strategies typically employ word embedding models to transform text into numeric representation for deep learning models. Word to Vector(Word2Vec), Global Vector(GloVe), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo), and BERT are commonly used word-embedding [72][73]. ELMO [74] is a context-based word embedding method. that learns contextualised word representations based on a neurolinguistic model based on a character encoding layer and two Bidirectional-LSTM layers. BERT is a pre-trained language model utilising bidirectional representation for masked word embedding based on context. In contrast to GPT models, BERT incorporates bidirectional contextual and is often used for word embedding or refined as a model using task-specific data. The original BERT consists of two strategies for applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks: feature-based with 12 encoders and fine-tuning with 24 encoders [75], ELMo belonged to the former, and GPT was a type of fine-tuning. The RoBERTa (Robust BERT) [76] is an optimised BERT model utilising a larger data corpus for pre-training. It can process longer text sequences, and dynamically change the masking pattern of the training data [77]. ROBERTa uses more parameters and a deeper network structure during pre-training. This enhancement significantly improves its performance in downstream tasks. The pre-training phase enables the BERT and RoBERTa models to acquire substantial knowledge, thereby facilitating its ability to effectively handle the target task with limited samples during the fine-tuning phase [78]. In our study, which comprises movie abuse and sentiment analysis, fine-tuning such models with appropriate data is critical. HateBERT [34], a variant of BERT with a deeper architecture and more parameters, enhances linguistic representation learning, similar to RoBERTa. This design improves its performance in hate speech detection tasks. Pre-trained with robust language comprehension capabilities, HateBERT adapts quickly to diverse downstream tasks during fine-tuning, even with limited labelled data. Our research shows that fine-tuning HateBERT on domain-specific data enables effective detection of abusive language in films and improves fine-grained sentiment analysis. This domain-specific training helps the model capture unique linguistic patterns, boosting its practical accuracy."}, {"title": "3.3.1.

Qiang et al. [79] preprocessed the raw data by filtering irrelevant characters using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) tool. The SenWave dataset has been used for identifying trends in the change of sentiment for post-COVID-19 studies [75] and also used for refined pre-trained language models for machine translation analysis for low resource languages [80].

In June 2015, Reddit banned hate speech-related Subreddits for violating the site's user agreement and tightened its content policy [83, 34]. Tommaso et al.

The RAL-E dataset has been utilised to train several transformer-based deep learning models, which have shown impressive performance in detecting online abuse [34, 84, 85].

Our framework uses three datasets, including the movie subtitles, the SenWave dataset for sentiment analysis and RAL-E dataset for abuse detection for refining the ROBERTa models.\nIn Stage 1, we download and curate movie subtitles, where we considered the Oscar-nominated films and the top 10 films at the box office to be the most representative films of each year with categories shown in Table 1. In Stage 2, we use NLTK [79] tool to remove the special phrases, such as hashtags, emotion symbols (emojis), stop words (e.g. \"the\", \"an\", \"you\") for each movie subtitles during data processing. We need accurate bigrams and trigrams for subsequent analysis, so we also eliminated stop words based on specific categories. In Stage 3, we analyse the processed movie subtitles and extract the top ten bigrams and trigrams for longitudinal analysis. We also report movie duration changes over the decades. We also process and clean the RAL-E dataset and the SenWave dataset for fine-tuning the BERT-based model at a later stage.\nIn Stage 4, we use two RoBERTa models obtained from HuggingFace [86] 8 and fine-tune them with SenWave and RAL-E datasets for sentiment analysis and abuse detection, respectively.

Results", "content": "4.1. Data analysis\nWe use N-gram analysis to outline the changes in the top twenty words of theme and sentiment in selected films over every 20 years. In Figure 2-Panel (a), we can observe that from 1950 to 1969, positive and colloquial phrases such as \"yes sir\u201d, \"let go\" and \"good night\" were frequent, and these words usually appear in contexts that express affirmation or goodwill. In addition, \"ha ha ha\" and \"good night good\" indicate that the movies from this period are positive and affirmative emotions. Between 1970 and 1989 (Figure 2)-Panel (b), we can see that common bigrams such as \"let go\" and \"yes sir\" still have a dominant position and \"oh god\" and \"come come\" have risen significantly. These changes reflect shock, surprise and action in the film. The appearance of \"come let go\" and \"go go go\" shows an increase in the film's depiction of the action. In the period 1990-2009 (Figure 2-Panel c), we can see that \"let go\", \"oh god\" and \"come come\" still appear more frequently in bigrams than previously. The common trigrams such as \"go go go\" and \"come let go\" continue to appear, but \"hey hey hey\" rises in frequency. The rapid increase in word frequency indicates a significant increase in the length of subtitles in movies over the past two decades.

Sentiment analysis", "content": "Movies are generally highly expressive, and there is often no single emotion that can be expressed in a film. The different types of emotions captured from the subtitles depend on the type of film as well as the specific plot. Figure 4 illustrates the frequency of different emotions in movies detected by RoBERTa refined using SenWave data. We find that humour (joking) is the most frequent sentiment, which indicates that humour and lighthearted elements are essential in engaging audiences. This is followed by \"annoyed\", \"sad\", \"pessimistic\", and optimistic sentiments which include all the selected movies from 1950 to 2024. We note that these include Oscar-nominated movies and blockbusters in four major categories. Figure 5 presents the results for the movies in the four major including action, comedy, drama and thriller. We can observe that the humour sentiment is expressed the most in all categories, followed by \"annoyed\". The proposition of \"sad\" is different, where drama has the most and action and thriller have the least. We can observe that there is a high number of \"sad\" sentiments in the \"comedy\" category. Most movies would fall into two categories. For example, the movie \"Annie Hall\" is an example of a movie that would fall both in comedy and drama and \"The Departed\" would fall both in action and thriller categories. Therefore, the sentiments detected have overlaps across the categories.\nWe input the entire movie subtitle dataset into the ROBERTa model to generate word embeddings. A fully connected layer was then appended to the RoBERTa output, with the output dimensionality corresponding to the number of sentiment dimensions. Using an unconstrained linear activation function, we acquired sentiment weights ranging from -4 to 3, as depicted in Figure 6. This demonstrates the contribution of different emotions to the overall affective polarity score, where positive numbers indicate positive emotions and negative numbers indicate negative emotions.\nBased on Figure 6, we calculated the Average Sentiment Weight score for every decade as shown in Figure 7. We observe that for blockbuster movies, the weighted sentiment scores are much higher during the 1950s, 1980s, and 1990s when compared to other periods, indicating that movies had richer emotional expressions during these three decades. In the case of Oscar-nominated movies, the average weighted sentiment score has been much higher than other periods since 2020, indicating that the Oscars are gradually increasing their focus on films with richer emotional expressions. The standard deviation values in the bar chart are substantially higher during the 1950s, 1990s, and 2000s compared to other periods, indicating notable differences in emotional expression among films in these three periods."}, {"title": "4.3.

Figures 8 and 9 present the results for abusive content, demonstrating how the movie subtitles have changed over the years influenced by social-cultural, censorship, film genres, and external factors such as epidemics.\nWe utilise a look-up dictionary to count the number of abusive words. Figure 8 shows the trend of the number of words and abusive words in the film subtitles for each decade. We observe that the trend of the number of total words and the number of abusive words exhibits a greater degree of similarity across different decades. After the 1970s, the proportion of abusive words to total words in film subtitles across decades has not changed significantly. Such fluctuations may be attributed to changes in social tolerance for film content, the influence of censorship, and the emergence of new film genres.\nFigure 9 compares the average film durations in each decade with the durations of abusive content within them. The decline in abusive content post-1970s reflects shifting sociocultural norms and censorship policies.\nFigure 10 presents trends in the amount of violent content detected in Oscar-nominated films and top 10 blockbuster films between 1950 and 2024. We observe that abusive content has shown a gradual increase since 1980, peaking in 2014 which may reflect the growth of the film industry and the changing social and cultural acceptance of abusive content. From 1950 to 1980, the amount of abuse in Oscar-nominated and top 10 blockbuster films was relatively small. This could be due to more conservative social and cultural requirements of film content at the time. However, abusive content gradually increased after the 1980s and the amount of abuse in the top 10 blockbuster films almost surpassed that in Oscar-nominated movies before 2010, and fallen significantly since then. This may indicate that Oscar-nominated films have become bolder and more diverse in subject and content, and the increase in abusive content may be an attempt to better represent complex social issues"}, {"title": "4.4.

At 00:27:32,684 to 00:27:34,777, \"Yeah, that's right, fancy. Are you a statie?\" expresses medium-level positive emotion, possibly indicating curiosity or mild amusement. However, from 01:32:36,031 to 01:32:40,434, the tone shifts dramatically with \"You pressure me to fear for my life and I will put a fucking bullet in your head...\", which conveys a high level of negative emotion, likely reflecting intense anger or threat. This intensity continues at 01:33:05,393 to 01:33:07,691 with \"One of your guys is going to pop you,\" which also shows high negative emotion, suggesting violence or hostility. The sentiment remains negative from 01:33:10,365 to 01:33:12,663, where \"As for running drugs, what the fuck are you doing?\" conveys frustration and strong disapproval. At 01:33:12,834 to 01:33:16,429, \"You don't need the money or the pain in the ass. And they will catch you.\" expresses medium-level negative emotion, indicating resignation or warning. Finally, at 01:33:23,211 to 01:33:26,476, \"Tell you the truth, I don't need pussy anymore, either\" reveals a medium-level negative tone, possibly reflecting a sense of emotional detachment or bitterness. Overall, the emotional tone shifts sharply from medium positive to high negative, conveying strong hostility and frustration throughout the dialogue.\nAnnie Hall's sentiment shifts range from positive to negative in Table 4. In the beginning, from 00:25:34,241 to 00:25:39,036, the phrase \"You play well\" reflects a low level of positive emotion. Then, from 00:34:44,415 to 00:34:46,416, \"Give me a kiss\" conveys a medium level of positive emotion.

The sentiment polarity fluctuates considerably throughout the movie's timeline and peaks around the 30th minute. Furthermore, the abusive words are frequent during certain periods of the film, especially between 65-105 minutes and 135-145 minutes. These periods may correspond to high-intensity dialogues or conflict scenes. A combination of the two graphs suggests a possible correlation between significant decreases in emotional polarity and a high frequency of abusive content or behaviour.\nFigure 15 presents sentiment polarity and abusive content for the movie \"Annie Hall\". The emotional polarity of the movie fluctuates within a generally positive range, mostly between -0.05 and 0.20. Around the 90th minute, the polarity briefly drops into a negative zone but quickly rebounds, reflecting an emotional low point followed by recovery. This trend aligns with the movie's overall optimistic tone, likely tied to its comedic and lighthearted theme. We find that the abusive content is concentrated and sporadic, which shows that only a certain part of the film contains relatively concentrated violent or offensive language content. We find no significant change in sentiment polarity during the period of high incidence of violent content (about 40 to 60 minutes), but there was a small positive"}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "Our research shows that sentiment polarity analysis underscores the nuanced emotional landscape of films, clearly indicating that movies have become more emotionally complex over the years. The average sentiment scores reveal a trend towards more balanced emotional expressions, with a slight decline in positive sentiment polarity in recent decades. This could be attributed to the increasing depiction of complex and often darker themes in contemporary cinema. The sentiment co-occurrence analysis revealed intriguing patterns in how emotions interplay within movie dialogues. High co-occurrence frequencies of emotions like joking and annoyance, or sadness and anger, highlight the complex emotional dynamics filmmakers utilise to engage audiences. The rarity of co-occurrences between emotions like thankfulness and pessimism further illustrates the deliberate emotional structuring in cinematic storytelling. In related studies, Palomo et al. [87] used deep learning technology to conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews and revealed the changes in emotional tendencies in movie reviews of different periods. They reported that from the 1950s to the 1980s, emotional expression underwent significant changes, and since the 1980s, emotional expression has become more complex, especially under the influence of social events such as the global financial crisis, climate change and pandemics. The impact of negative emotions has become more pronounced given feat from catastrophic natural events, poor governance and politics. However, our study of movie subtitles takes a different approach where we evaluated the content of the movie rather than how the society views them.\nRegarding detection of abuse, our study overlaps with Demarty et al. [88] who provided a study on multimodal violence detection by combining video, audio and text subtitle analysis. They reported that the accuracy of violence detection can be significantly improved by integrating visual, audio and language features. Information from the different modes complements each other, helping to capture more complex features of violent scenes. However, our approach pays more attention to the combination of text and context. In our case, we observed that there has been fluctuations in levels of violence in the two major categories (Oscar-nominated and blockbusters) and the level of abuse for Oscar-movies took over blockbusters since 2010 (Figure 11). This could be due to over-commercialisation,"}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "We employed LLMs for a longitudinal study of abuse and sentiment analysis of subtitle dialogues from prominent Hollywood movies spanning seven decades (1950-2024), including Oscar-nominated and top ten blockbuster movies. We refined LLMs using specific sentiment analysis and abusive datasets. to discern significant trends and shifts in the emotional and abusive content within movie dialogues.\nOur results reveal a complex landscape of emotional expression in movies, with notable fluctuations in the prevalence of various sentiments and abusive content. Our findings indicate that while positive emotions such as humour and optimism have consistently been integral to movie dialogues, the representation of negative emotions like anger, sadness, and anxiety has varied significantly, often reflecting broader social and cultural changes. Our categorisation of films into four broad genres action, comedy, drama, and thriller-provided further granularity to our analysis. Each genre exhibited distinct patterns of emotional and abusive content, with overlaps, since the majority of movies can be classified into two categories.\nOne of the key insights is the gradual increase of abusive content in movie dialogues over time, especially in the last two decades, where Oscar-nominated movies overtook the top ten blockbusters. This trend suggests a gradual shift in the industry's approach to depicting violence and abuse, potentially influenced by evolving societal norms and regulatory frameworks."}, {"title": "7.

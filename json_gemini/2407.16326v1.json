Entities\nof the KB are represented by vertices of the KG, and links between entities are represented by edges. Knowledge bases\nare usually incomplete [13] due to missing or outdated data sources. There are several tasks related to the problem:\nknowledge graph completion (recovery of missing facts), knowledge graph correction (remove erroneous facts), link\nprediction (recovery of missing link, i.e., recovery a triplet head-relation-tail by given only two components), triplet\nclassification (identifying whether a triplet is a true fact), entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes),\nrule extraction (inferring an inner logic of knowledge graph), entity resolution (find entities refering to the same\nreal-world object) and so on. To acquire the knowledge or remove incorrect facts, various KGE methods have been\nproposed. Comprehensive list of KGE methods has been available at https://github.com/ysxinguo/KGE. Some\nof them report inability of diverse methods to properly encode various relation patterns. Wang et al. [11] report\nthat TransE [2] cannot properly model reflexive/one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations, and introduce the\nTransH method to overcome these problems. However, they do not compare reasoning abilities of TransE and TransH\nin general. The same case with the RotatE [9] and the HAKE [14] methods.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to introduce a mathematical framework to compare reasoning abilities of KGE methods.\n\nThe remainder of this article is organised as follows.

It turns out, that M\u2081 ~ M2 iff M\u2081 expressed by M2 (and, symmetrically, M2 expressed by M\u2081).\nInformally, \"the model M\u2081 expressed by the model M2\u201d means that for each triplet (h, r, t) if the model M\u2081 evaluates\nthat (h, r,t) is positive, then the model M2 evaluates that (h,r,t) is positive too, and if the model M\u2081 evaluates that\n(h, r, t) is negative, then the model M2 evaluates that (h, r, t) is negative too. For more details, see the definition (3.19)\nand the theorem (3.20).\n\nBased on this observation, we can compare families of embedding models.\nDefinition 3.12 (Generally expressed by).

If F\u2081 is dimensionally ex-\npressed by F2, then F\u2081 is generally expressed by F2.\n\nThe statement \"F\u2081 is generally/dimensionally expressed by F2\u201d means that each model in F\u2081 has an equally expressive\nmodel in F2. We are concerned with the following question: is there a model in F2 that has no equally expressive\nmodels in F\u2081? We introduce the denotations F\u2081 [g F2, F1 [d F2, if the answer is yes, and F\u2081 =g F2, F1 =d F2, if\nthe answer is no.\nDefinition 3.15 (Equal general expressive power).

In the lemma (3.22) we will\nprove that if M\u2081 is expressed by M2, then M\u2081 ~ M2. Next, since the conditions (10) and (11) are symmetric with\nrespect to M\u2081 and M2, we will conclude that M\u2081 ~ M2 iff M2 is expressed by M1.\n\nLemma 3.21.

Now we will prove the second part.\n\nFix some k\u2208N.\nLet W' \u2208 Rkxk be a not invertible matrix. There is a non-zero x' \u2208 Rk such that W'x' = 0.\nSelect some different e1,e2 \u2208 E and ro \u2208 R.

We obtain\n\u00cbe,ca (e1) + \u00cbr,ca(ro) = \u00cb\u025b,ca(e1), \u00cb\u025b,ca(e2) + \u00cbr,ca (ro) = \u00cbe,ca(e1), (49)"}, {"title": "and so \u00cbe,ca (e\u2081) = \u00cb\u025b,ca(e2).

Therefore, the assumption on existing of a TransComplEx embedding model\nM such that M ~ M is false.\nThe second part of the proof is completed.\n\nRemark 4.2. Consider the models M' and M\" in the proof of the theorem (4.1). The number of complex parameters\nfor the model M' is d(|E|+|R|).

Infrared object detectors are vital in modern technological applications but are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant security threats. Previous studies using physical perturbations like light bulb arrays and aerogels for white-box attacks, or hot and cold patches for black-box attacks, have proven impractical or limited in multi-view support. To address these issues, we propose the Adversarial Infrared Grid (AdvGrid), which models perturbations in a grid format and uses a genetic algorithm for black-box optimization. These perturbations are cyclically applied to various parts of a pedestrian's clothing to facilitate multi-view black-box physical attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors. Extensive experiments validate AdvGrid's effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness. The method achieves attack success rates of 80.00% in digital environments and 91.86% in physical environments, outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, the average attack success rate exceeds 50% against mainstream detectors, demonstrating AdvGrid's robustness. Our analyses include ablation studies, transfer attacks, and adversarial defenses, confirming the method's superiority.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Currently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various fields and have become a core technology in artificial intelligence. They are widely applied with significant effectiveness in areas such as image recognition He et al. (2016), speech recognition Radford et al. (2023), natural language processing Zaremba and Demir (2023), and object detection Farhadi and Redmon (2018). For instance, in image recognition, DNNs can accurately classify and identify various images; in speech recognition, they can convert speech into text, achieving high-precision speech-to-text conversion; in natural language processing, DNNs can understand and generate natural language, enabling functionalities such as automatic translation and question-answering systems; in object detection, DNNs can accurately identify and locate target objects in images and videos.\nRegarding object detection, many research efforts involve training detectors by collecting a large number of samples in visible light environments He et al. (2017); Ren et al. (2015). These detectors, carefully designed and trained, demonstrate strong robustness and high accuracy under standard lighting conditions. However, their performance is significantly affected in low-light or dim conditions. To overcome this limitation, some researchers Liu et al. (2022) have recently shifted their focus to the infrared domain. By collecting infrared samples, researchers can train robust detectors that perform well under various lighting conditions. These infrared detectors not only function normally during the day but also maintain high-efficiency target detection capabilities at night or in low-light environments. The success of this approach not only broadens the application scope of object detection technology but also provides new solutions for addressing illumination variations in practical applications.\nAs DNN-based tasks advance, their security performance has also garnered scholarly attention. Infrared target detectors, combining infrared imaging technology and deep neural networks, are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks Li et al. (2023a); Duan et al. (2021a). In adversarial attacks, digital adversarial attacks Li et al. (2023b) involve adding imperceptible perturbations directly to digital images. In contrast, physical adversarial attacks Zheng et al. (2023); Doan et al. (2022) require adding noticeable perturbations to the target object, then using sensors to capture samples and input them into the target model to execute the attack. Most current physical adversarial attacks Wang et al. (2022, 2021) on target detectors are deployed in the visible light modality, with only a few studies Zhu et al. (2021, 2023) exploring physical attacks in the infrared modality, making the research on infrared physical adversarial attack techniques particularly urgent.\nExisting infrared physical adversarial attack techniques, as illustrated in Figure 1, encompass various approaches utilizing different physical perturbations to execute infrared attacks. These include using light bulb arrays Figure 1(a) Zhu et al. (2021), QR code clothing Figure 1(b) Zhu et al. (2022), aerogels Figure 1(c) Wei et al. (2023b), and electric heating films Figure 1(d) Zhu et al. (2023). These methods primarily target white-box physical attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors, operating under the assumption that the attacker has access to the target model's architecture and parameters. While this assumption holds in theoretical research, it is impractical in real-world scenarios, where attackers typically cannot obtain such detailed internal information. For black-box physical attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors Hu et al. (2024a,b); Wei et al. (2023a), researchers often employ hot and cold pastes as physical perturbations Figures 1(e), (f), (g). These materials are readily available and can be discreetly affixed inside a pedestrian's clothing, making them difficult for human observers to detect. Without infrared sensors, defenders struggle to identify the presence of these physical perturbations. However, these existing black-box attack methods have significant limitations, particularly in achieving multi-view adversarial effects. This means that the attack's effectiveness diminishes or fails entirely when the target is observed or detected from different angles, thus limiting the practical applicability and effectiveness of the attack.\nTo address the limitations of existing infrared physical adversarial attack methods, this study proposes the AdvGrid for multi-view black-box adversarial attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors. This method utilizes cold patches that can be affixed inside clothing as physical perturbations to enhance stealth. By simulating the grid model and optimizing its physical parameters using genetic algorithms Holland (1992), the most adversarial infrared grid parameters are obtained. The Expectation Over Transformation framework Athalye et al. (2018) is then employed for robust enhancement, further improving the adversarial effect. Additionally, Thin Plate Spline Bookstein (1989) is used for fold simulation to enhance the stability of physical perturbations. Finally, in the physical world, the optimized perturbations are cyclically attached to the inside of pedestrian clothing, achieving multi-view black-box attacks on infrared pedestrian detectors.\nTable 1 compares the proposed method with existing infrared physical attack methods. It is evident that besides AdvGrid, no other method simultaneously offers the advantages of black-box adversarial attacks, stealth, and multi-view capability. Additionally, the cost of deploying physical adversarial attacks using our method is inexpensive, with a total cost of less than $10, making it easier to implement.

Problem definition", "content": "Object detector: Consider an infrared pedestrian imaging dataset DS, where X denotes the clean infrared images and Y represents the corresponding correct labels for pedestrians. Let f denote the object detector. For each input image $X \u2208 DS$ in the dataset, the pretrained model $f : X \u2192 Y$ of the object detector analyzes the image and predicts a label y that aligns with the correct label Y. The predicted label y includes the following key components: the location information of the bounding box ($Y_{pos}$), the confidence or probability of the target ($Y_{obj}$), and the category information of the target ($y_{cls}$). Utilizing this information, the object detector can accurately identify and locate pedestrians, ensuring stable and reliable detection performance across various environments:\n$y:= [Y_{pos}, Y_{obj}, Y_{cls}] = f(X)$\nEOT Framework: The Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) framework Athalye et al. (2018) presents a systematic approach to generate resilient adversarial samples, with the aim of bolstering the efficacy of adversarial attacks across diverse environments and conditions. Originally introduced by Athalye et al. in 2018, this framework has found extensive application in the realm of adversarial attack research within physical contexts. Leveraging a series of stochastic transformations applied to input samples, the EOT framework ensures the resilience of generated adversarial samples across varying conditions. Central to its methodology is the optimization of adversarial samples to effectively subvert target models amidst multiple transformational scenarios, encompassing translations, rotations, scalings, and alterations in lighting conditions. While conventional adversarial attack methods typically operate under the assumption of static and unchanging input data, real-world scenarios often entail dynamic transformations. EOT, by accounting for these transformations, engenders adversarial samples of heightened robustness.\nTPS Framework: The Thin Plate Spline (TPS) framework Bookstein (1989) constitutes a widely employed deformation model prevalent in image processing, computer vision, and machine learning domains. Originally formulated by Fred L. Bookstein in 1989, it primarily addresses non-rigid deformations of images and shapes. The TPS model employs a smooth and differentiable function to effectuate the transformation from a source image or shape to a target counterpart. Its procedural steps entail the selection of control points, adoption of the TPS deformation model, solution of linear equations to ascertain deformation function parameters, pixel-wise mapping from the source to the target image, and eventual application of the deformation function to yield the deformed image."}, {"title": "3.2. Adversarial attack framework", "content": "Figure 2 illustrates the adversarial attack framework of this method, comprising seven key components: Simulation and Modeling: This initial phase involves modeling the infrared grid to ascertain its physical parameters, encompassing factors like location, dimensions, and width. These parameters serve as the foundation for subsequent optimization steps. Binary Encoding and Population Initialization: The physical parameters of the infrared grid are encoded into binary form, and an initial population is initialized. This step ensures diversity and a rational distribution within the population. Conversion to Digital Perturbations: Binary encoded parameters are transformed into digital perturbations, which are then combined with clean samples to generate digital representations simulating real-world physical perturbations. Evaluation and EOT Robustness Enhancement: The digital samples are input into DNNs for evaluation. Subsequently, EOT robustness enhancement techniques are applied to augment the stability and efficacy of the adversarial perturbations. Genetic Algorithm Optimization: A suitable fitness function is selected, guiding the selection of individuals within the population. Crossover and mutation operations are performed iteratively on the population using genetic algorithms, gradually refining parameters towards optimal solutions. Perturbation Splicing and TPS Robustness Enhancement: The most adversarial perturbations are selected, followed by random cropping of perturbation blocks. TPS robustness enhancement techniques are applied to enhance stability and resistance to deformation. Enhanced perturbations are then integrated into pedestrian images from various viewpoints, ensuring effective attacks from multiple perspectives. Physical Deployment: In the physical realm, optimized perturbation patterns are embedded within pedestrian clothing. This facilitates multi-view adversarial effects, rendering real pedestrians challenging to detect by infrared pedestrian detectors in practical scenarios, thereby achieving covert attack objectives."}, {"title": "3.3. Generate adversarial sample", "content": "In this work, infrared perturbations are simulated and modeled using a grid approach for multi-view optimization and deployment. As shown in Figure 3, each individual infrared grid block consists of four physical parameters: location, color, width, and dimension. The detailed definitions of each parameter are as follows:\nLocation (P(i,j)): In this study, P(i, j) represents the top-left coordinate of each independent grid, determining the specific location of the grid on the pedestrian's body. Each independent grid within the grid block is continuously simulated, meaning the grids are connected. Disconnected appearances in Figure 3 are due to transparent grid settings (i.e., no perturbation at that position). Thus, the position parameters are formalized as $P = (i_{11}, j_{11}), (i_{12}, j_{12}), ..., (i_{DD}, j_{DD})$, where $(i_{11}, j_{11})$ represents the position of each independent subgrid in the simulated infrared grid block.\nColor (C): Parameter $C$ represents the color of the infrared grid block. Since objects under infrared cameras typically appear in black, white, and gray, the color value of each subgrid perturbation in this study is fixed to either no color or black (C(0,0,0)). When the subgrid color is set to no color, the perturbation at that position becomes discontinuous, increasing the diversity of perturbations and enhancing the likelihood of successful adversarial attacks.\nWidth (W): Parameter $W$ represents the width of the infrared grid. If the grid width is too large, it will exceed the pedestrian's boundary; if the width is too small, the subgrids will be too dense, which is not conducive to physical deployment. After repeated testing, setting the width to one-fifth of the height of the pedestrian's bounding box is found to be a reasonable configuration. This setting is advantageous because in digital images where only the left or right half of the pedestrian's body is captured, setting the width to two-thirds of the bounding box width results in a smaller perturbation area, and the generated perturbations do not achieve the expected effect.\nDimension (D): Parameter $D$ represents the dimension of the infrared grid. After fixing the grid width, if the dimension is set too large, the grids will be too dense, making it difficult to deploy in the physical world. Conversely, if the dimension is set too small, it reduces the diversity of perturbations and weakens the effectiveness of digital adversarial attacks. A small dimension also causes large wrinkles during multi-view deployment, weakening the physical attack effect. In the experiment, the dimension is set to $D = 8$ to ensure that the perturbations are diverse and can be effectively deployed in the physical world.\nWe use $(P, C, W, D)$ (abbreviated as $\\theta$) to represent an infrared grid. To ensure that the perturbations appear in the pedestrian area, a mask M is used to limit the position area of the perturbations. Therefore, the process of generating adversarial samples can be represented as follows:\n$X_{adv} = S(X,\\theta, M)$\nIn this context, $X_{adv}$ represents the adversarial sample, and S is a linear fusion function that combines the clean sample with the simulated infrared grid to create the adversarial sample.\nAfter generating the adversarial samples, it is important to address the challenges associated with transferring these samples from a static and fixed digital environment to the physical domain. This transfer can introduce issues such as position errors, lighting changes, and noise impacts. To mitigate these issues, the EOT framework Athalye et al. (2018) is employed to simulate various transformation conditions, thereby generating more robust and practical adversarial samples. The EOT framework uses a distribution of transformations T to model domain transfer, where each instance represents a combination of random image transformations, including perspective transformation, brightness adjustment, downsampling, and more. Consequently, the adversarial samples enhanced by the EOT framework can be expressed as follows:\n$X_{adv} = E_{t~T}t(X_{adv})$\nFollowing robustness enhancement with the EOT framework, it is necessary to consider the deployment of perturbations inside pedestrian clothing. Given that clothing is a non-rigid object prone to deformation, the TPS architecture Bookstein (1989) is further employed to map the perturbations from the digital domain to the physical domain. This ensures that the enhanced adversarial samples can better adapt to changes in the real environment. Specifically, the enhanced adversarial samples can be represented as:\n$X_{adv} = TPS(E_{t~T}t(X_{adv}))$"}, {"title": "3.4. Infrared grid adversarial attack", "content": "The proposed method aims to optimize the physical parameters of the infrared grid using a genetic algorithm to generate the most adversarial infrared grid, which is then fused with clean samples to obtain the most adversarial digital samples. This method targets more realistic scenarios for black-box attacks, where the attacker cannot access the internal information of the model such as its architecture and parameters, and can only obtain the model's output, such as the detected object's category and confidence. Therefore, the method takes the confidence of the target object as the adversarial loss and formalizes the objective function to minimize the confidence of the infrared detector for the target object:\n$arg \\min_{\\theta} TPS(E_{t~T}(Y_{obj} \u2190 f(t(X_{adv}))))$\nThis method implements the global optimization shown in Equation 5 using a genetic algorithm to obtain the final optimal solution, which are the physical parameters of the most adversarial infrared grid. These physical perturbations are then deployed in the real world to deceive infrared target detectors. The process of optimizing the infrared grid using a genetic algorithm Holland (1992) is introduced below.\nRandom Initialization: During the optimization process of AdvGrid, a randomly initialized population of candidate solutions (POP) is first generated. Each solution in the population corresponds to a set of physical parameters $\\theta$ that define the infrared grid used to generate adversarial samples. Random initialization helps ensure the diversity of the search space, increasing the likelihood of finding the optimal solution. This process is represented as:\n$POP = [\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_G]$\nwhere G represents the population size and $\\theta_g$ represents a candidate solution in the population (g = 1, 2, ..., G).\nFitness Calculation: After initializing the population, each individual in the population generates adversarial samples. The confidence score of the model's output for the correct label on these adversarial samples is used as the fitness value for each individual. This way, the effectiveness of each individual in attacking the target model can be evaluated\u2014the higher the fitness value, the more successful the adversarial sample is:\n$fit_g = 1 - (Y_{obj} \u2190 f(S(X,\\theta_g, M))) \\hspace{1cm} g = 1, 2, ..., G$\nwhere, $fit_g$ represents the fitness value of the g th individual.\nSelection Operation: Based on the confidence values of each individual in the population, a selection operation is performed. This work adopts a novel selection operation where individuals with confidence values greater than 80% (i.e., fitness less than 20%) are eliminated first, as these individuals perform the worst in the attack. New individuals are then randomly generated to replenish the population, maintaining diversity and population size. The selection operation is denoted by SL, and the new population after selection can be represented as:\n$POP_{s+1} \u2190 SL(POP_s, fit_g) \\hspace{1cm} s = 1, 2, ..., S \\hspace{0.5cm} g = 1, 2, ..., G$\nwhere S represents the total number of generations, and $POP_s$ represents the population in the s - th generation.\nCrossover Operation: First, genes in the population are randomly paired. Then, for each pair of genes, a random gene position is selected, and with a probability $P_c$, the selected gene and the genes following it are exchanged, achieving the crossover operation. The crossover operation is denoted by CS, and the new gene pairs after crossover can be represented as:\n$POP_{s+1} \u2190 CS(POP_s, P_c) \\hspace{1cm} s = 1, 2, ..., S$\nMutation Operation: After crossover, the population undergoes mutation. For each individual in the population, a gene is randomly selected, and with a probability $P_m$, this gene is flipped, i.e., 0 is mutated to 1 and 1 is mutated to 0. The mutation operation is denoted by MT, and the mutated population can be represented as:\n$POP_{s+1} \u2190 MT(POP_s, P_m) \\hspace{1cm} s = 1, 2, ..., S$\nAdvGrid, through S iterations of the genetic algorithm, obtains the physical parameters of the most adversarial infrared grid to generate adversarial samples that can deceive the infrared target detector. These samples are then robustly enhanced using the EOT framework and TPS. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode of the proposed AdvGrid, with clean samples X, target detector f, population size G, number of iterations S, crossover rate $P_c$, and mutation rate $P_m$ as inputs. The algorithm randomly initializes the population and performs fitness calculation, crossover, and mutation operations for each individual, repeating this loop continuously. The algorithm ultimately outputs the physical parameters $\\theta^*$ for subsequent physical attack experiments."}, {"title": "4. Experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1. Experimental setting", "content": "Dataset: In line with AdvIB Hu et al. (2024a), we use the FLIR dataset FLIR for training infrared pedestrian detectors and testing digital attacks. The FLIR dataset comprises a total of 10,228 infrared images, captured using a FLIR Tau2 thermal camera. A notable feature of this dataset is the meticulous manual annotation of all thermal images, accurately distinguishing four categories of target objects: people, bicycles, cars, and dogs. For model training, we implement a strict filtering process, retaining only pedestrian images with heights exceeding 120 pixels. This refinement yielded 1,011 highly relevant samples for training infrared pedestrian detectors. Subsequent adversarial attack experiments are conducted using the test set of this dataset, providing a basis for comprehensive digital attack simulations.\nObject Detectors: For the object detection task, this study adopts a series of advanced detection models previously utilized by AdvIB, including Yolo v3 Farhadi and Redmon (2018), DETR Carion et al. (2020), Mask R-CNN He et al. (2017), Faster R-CNN Ren et al. (2015), Libra R-CNN Pang et al. (2019), and RetinaNet Lin et al. (2017). These models undergo meticulous training on the specially curated dataset to optimize their target recognition capabilities in complex scenarios. After rigorous training processes, the models demonstrated excellent performance on their respective test sets, with the following average precision scores: Yolo v3 achieves 90.7%, DETR reaches 91.2%, Mask R-CNN records 89.5%, Faster R-CNN achieves 90.8%, Libra R-CNN obtaines 88.0%, and RetinaNet leads with a high precision of 93.0%. These results not only validate the robustness of the selected models but also lay a solid foundation for subsequent adversarial attack research and defense strategy development. In subsequent attack experiments, unless otherwise specified, all attacks are conducted against Yolo v3.\nExperimental Devices: During the physical attack experiments, our devices, as shown in Figure 4 (a), consist of a stable tripod, a high-performance infrared camera, and cold patches. The infrared camera used is the HIKMICRO FQ25, which boasts excellent imaging performance with the following specifications: a focal plane array (FPA) of 640\u00d7512 pixels and a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of less than 25 mK, ensuring high detection sensitivity and image clarity. To verify the general applicability of the method, we test the AdvGrid technique on various infrared camera models. The results clearly indicated that the effectiveness of the technique is not dependent on the specific camera model, demonstrating good compatibility and versatility. The cold patch, capable of maintaining a stable temperature at 24\u00b0C for up to 10 hours, provides reliable temperature control for long-duration experiments. Figures 4 (b), (c), and (d) show the visible light images of the external and internal views of the infrared stealth clothing generated by our method, as well as the infrared image. It is evident that without the aid of a infrared camera, the perturbations are imperceptible to the naked eye. Figures 4 (e) and (f) respectively display the visible light and infrared images of a person wearing the stealth clothing.\nEvaluation Metrics: The goal of the proposed AdvGrid is to achieve evasion attacks. Therefore, the attack success rate is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the higher the attack success rate, the more adversarial the method, and vice versa. The formula for calculating the attack success rate is as follows:\n$ASR(X) = 1 - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} F(Y_{obj})$\n$F(Y_{obj}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & Y_{obj} < 0.5 \\\\ 1 & otherwise \\end{cases}$\nwhere N denotes the number of true positive labels in the dataset that the detector can identify in the absence of any attacks. Throughout all our attack experiments, a threshold of 0.5 is maintained. Specifically, an evasion attack is deemed successful if the confidence level of the detected target drops below this threshold.\nBaseline Methods: Since AdvGrid is a black-box attack, this method uses existing black-box attacks as baseline methods for comparison, including HCB, AdvIB, and AdvIC.\nOther Settings: In this method, the dimension of the infrared grid is set to $D = 8$, and the width is set to one-fifth of the height of the infrared pedestrian target detection box. The genetic algorithm parameters are set as follows: G = 50 (population size), S = 10 (number of iterations), $P_c$ = 0.6 (crossover rate), and $P_m$ = 0.1 (mutation rate). All adversarial attack experiments are run on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU."}, {"title": "4.2. Evaluation of effectiveness", "content": "Digital Testing: To evaluate the effectiveness of our digital attacks, we carefully select specific data from the FLIR dataset to form our test set and implement our attack strategy based on this selection. Using a meticulously designed infrared grid attack configuration (with grid dimensions of 8 and a width equal to one-fifth of the detection box height), we achieve an 80% attack success rate with an average query count of only 117.53. These experimental results robustly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in a digital environment. Figure 5 vividly illustrates the adversarial samples generated during this attack process. As shown, the infrared grid perturbations are seamlessly integrated into the pedestrian images, maintaining a degree of visual stealthiness while effectively evading infrared pedestrian detection systems. This underscores the potential and advantages of our method in practical applications.\nPhysical Testing: In the physical testing phase, we use carefully crafted infrared stealth clothing to conduct the attack tests. The testing process involved pedestrians wearing the stealth clothing and using an infrared camera to capture images from various angles and distances, ranging from 6 meters to 11 meters in 1-meter intervals, and covering a 360-degree field of view with 30-degree intervals at each stop. We meticulously analyze the attack success rates for each combination of distance and angle, compiling all data into Table 2. Key findings from this data include: 1) Overall Excellent Performance: Across all physical tests, we achieve an average attack success rate of 91.86%, strongly validating the applicability and effectiveness of our proposed method in real-world scenarios. 2) Multi-Angle Effectiveness: Regardless of distance or angle, our method consistently produces significant adversarial effects. Even under the most challenging conditions, we achieve at least a 49.26% attack success rate, demonstrating robustness in various settings. 3) View Angle Adaptability: Remarkably, nearly half (34 out of 72) of our test cases achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate, highlighting the method's powerful capability to handle multi-angle challenges and validating its reliability in multi-view adversarial attacks.

Evaluation of stealthiness", "content": "Observing subfigures (e) and (f) of Figure 4, we notice that, compared to methods such as BulbAttack, QRattack, and AIP, which place perturbations conspicuously on the exterior of the pedestrian's clothing, our method integrates perturbations subtly within the clothing. This design strategy ensures that, without specialized equipment like thermal imaging cameras, ordinary observers cannot easily detect the presence of perturbations, significantly enhancing the stealthiness of adversarial samples in real-world settings. Figure 7 further displays the physical adversarial samples generated by baseline methods. Notably, the physical samples generated by AdvGrid exhibit more dispersed perturbation effects, which not only enhance the samples' stealthiness but also give AdvGrid a distinct advantage in physical environments. In stark contrast, the physical samples from baseline methods often appear less covert due to overly concentrated or exposed perturbations."}, {"title": "4.4.

After deploying AdvGrid for the attack, we record the relevant experimental results in Table 3 and summarize them as follows: 1) Average attack success rate: AdvGrid achieves an average attack success rate of 59.66% across all tested detectors. This result not only validates AdvGrid's generalization ability against different infrared pedestrian target detectors but also demonstrates its potential as an effective adversarial strategy. 2) Efficiency analysis: In all conducted attack experiments, AdvGrid requires fewer than 500 queries to complete the attacks. This indicates that AdvGrid not only effectively launches attacks on detectors but also performs quite efficiently in terms of computational resource consumption, making it an ideal choice for deployment in practical scenarios. 3) Attack effects on DETR: It is worth noting that AdvGrid's effectiveness is slightly inferior when attacking DETR detectors based on Transformer architecture compared to other models. This finding suggests that Transformer-based detectors may exhibit stronger robustness and defense capabilities against specific types of adversarial attacks. In summary, AdvGrid demonstrates significant generalization performance and efficiency in adversarial attacks against infrared pedestrian target detectors, especially when targeting non-Transformer architecture detectors. However, for Transformer-based detectors like DETR, its attack effectiveness is slightly lower, indicating directions for future research to improve the universality and effectiveness of adversarial strategies.\nComparison of AdvGrid with baseline methods' experimental results: We conduct a comprehensive comparison between the proposed AdvGrid and baseline methods, as shown in Table 4. It can be observed that while the proposed method ranks second to AdvIC in digital attack tests, it outperforms all baseline methods in physical attack tests. Additionally, although AdvGrid's digital attack performance is not as good as AdvIC's, AdvIC lacks multi-view adversarial effects.\nIn conclusion, the proposed method exhibits good generalization performance, and its physical adversarial effects outperform those of baseline methods, confirming the robustness of AdvGrid."}, {"title": "5.

{"title": "Smart E-commerce Recommendations with Semantic AI", "authors": ["Mohamed Badouch", "Mehdi Boutaounte"], "abstract": "In e-commerce, web mining for page recommendations is widely used but often fails to meet user needs. To address this, we propose a novel solution combining semantic web mining with BP neural networks. We process user search logs to extract five key features: content priority, time spent, user feedback (both explicit and implicit), recommendation semantics, and input deviation. These features are then fed into a BP neural network to classify and prioritize web pages. The prioritized pages are recommended to users. Using book sales pages for testing, our results demonstrate that this solution can quickly and accurately identify the pages users need. Our approach ensures that recommendations are more relevant and tailored to individual preferences, enhancing the online shopping experience. By leveraging advanced semantic analysis and neural network techniques, we bridge the gap between user expectations and actual recommendations. This innovative method not only improves accuracy but also speeds up the recommendation process, making it a valuable tool for e-commerce platforms aiming to boost user satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, our system's ability to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations makes it a scalable and efficient solution for modern e-commerce challenges.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In today's digital age, e-commerce has fundamentally transformed the way consumers purchase goods, offering unparalleled convenience and a vast array of choices. As online shopping becomes increasingly prevalent, the need for effective web page recommendation systems has grown. These systems are crucial for suggesting products that align with customers' shopping habits, thereby enhancing shopping efficiency, user satisfaction, and overall experience. To meet this demand, numerous personalized recommendation systems based on web mining have been developed. Web mining techniques analyze vast amounts of data generated by user interactions on e-commerce platforms. For instance, previous research has introduced sophisticated algorithms that utilize semantic web data mining to delve into user-visited pages and log data. By examining the content and context of these pages, these algorithms can construct predictive models that accurately forecast product preferences.\nAdditionally, some studies have employed user feedback mechanisms to refine these recommendations further. By collecting both explicit feedback (such as ratings and reviews) and implicit feedback (such as browsing history and click patterns), researchers have been able to train BP (Backpropagation) neural networks (3). These neural networks are adept at determining the relevance and importance of various e-commerce web pages, ensuring that the recommendations are both accurate and personalized.\nFor e-commerce platforms there is no organized web directory (1), users mostly rely on alerts from search engines to find suitable e-commerce pages. This can provide room for errors in sending relevance signals since most traditional search engines usually match queries based on statistical frequency and similarity in words which results in semantic mismatches and wrong retrieval results. It also means that those who advertise pay more money to be ranked high thus making it unworthy to trust such searches. A more trustworthy means lies within the do-main of semantic web technologies that provide a better classification of contents depending on core terms relating to each"}, {"title": "2. Methods", "content": "Backpropagation neural networks are a sophisticated class of artificial neural networks that utilize a specific learning process known as backpropagation. This method is crucial for training the network to minimize errors in its predictions, making it highly effective for tasks such as classification, regression, and recommendation systems (4)."}, {"title": "Phases of BP neural networks", "content": "Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used for training neural networks. It involves two main phases: the forward pass and the backward pass with error calculation (5).\nForward Pass:\n\u2022During the forward pass, input data is fed into the network.\n\u2022The data passes through multiple layers of neurons, each performing computations and applying activation functions.\n\u2022The final output is produced at the output layer, representing the network's prediction.\nError Calculation:\n\u2022The network's output is compared to the actual target values (ground truth).\n\u2022An error is calculated based on the difference between the predicted output and the actual target. This error is often measured using a loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss.\nBackward Pass:\n\u2022The error is propagated back through the network from the output layer to the input layer.\n\u2022The goal is to adjust the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error.\n\u2022This is achieved using gradient descent, where the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias is computed.\n\u2022The weights and biases are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient, reducing the error in subsequent iterations."}, {"title": "Layers of BP neural networks", "content": "This strategy involves using a three-layered Back Propagation (BP) neural network as a classifier for training and recognition, the network is comprised of three parts, namely the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer (6).\n\u2022Input Layer: The first layer that receives the raw input data. Each neuron in this layer represents a feature of the input data.\n\u2022Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers where the actual computation and learning occur.

The training process involves adjusting the network's parameters to minimize prediction errors. Specifically, we derive the weight matrix (Wji) and sill matrix (\u00d8) from the input layer to the hidden layer. These matrices are crucial for capturing the relationships between input features and hidden neurons (18). Additionally, we obtain the weight matrix (Vki) and threshold matrix (k) from the hidden layer to the output layer, which are essential for mapping the hidden layer's activations to the final output (8).\n$S_j = \\sum_{i = 0}^{I} W_{ji} X_i \u2013 \\theta_j, j = 1,2,...,J$\nTo begin with, compute the input (s,j) for the (j) neuron in the hidden layer. This computation uses the weight matrix (Wji) and the bias term (\u00d8j). The output (hj) of the (j) neuron in the hidden layer is then derived by:\n$h_j = g(W_j) = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2s_j}} - 1, j = 1,2,..., J$\nNext, determine the input (rk) of the output layer using (Vkj) and (pk) by:\n$r_k = \\sum_{j = 1}^{J} V_{ji} h_j - \\theta_k, k = 1,2,..., K$\nDerive the output values (k) and (y) from the output layer by:\n$Y_k = g(r_k) = \\frac{2}{1+e^{-2r_k}} - 1, k = 1,2,..., K$\nTo wrap up the process, determine the recognition result by locating the maximum value among the recognition similarity (values (yk)).

Conclusion", "content": "In this research work we describe a new system for recommending products from e-commerce portals using semantic web mining and BP neural networks. The importance of user preferences may help in designing better website structures for webmasters, who seek to create visually dynamic sites that incorporate design patterns which optimize user experience. To compare its results with the existing methods stated in other works, an experimental database containing book sales websites was built; hence, performance measures include accuracy of page recognition together with recall rates. Results show that our proposed technique is noble; it can learn from customer input while keeping low power consumption levels. The rise of deep learning has seen its application areas diversify into such fields as image processing, medical image analysis and image classification among others. There is no doubt that the future of e-commerce will be defined by deep learning technologies. Face recognition and future trend pre-diction based on past financial data can also be accomplished using neural networks and deep learning technologies (12). When merged with machine learning, these technologies are also helpful in climate prediction. Additionally, algorithmic techniques are employed for classification and autonomous learning (14). Integrating these algorithms with user purchasing and browsing data to predict e-commerce sales trends represents a promising research direction."}]}

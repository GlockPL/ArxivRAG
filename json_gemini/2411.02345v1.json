These miniature devices, utilizing nano bioelectronics and biologically inspired designs, offer precise control in disease diagnosis and treatment [3]. Recent advancements in nanotechnology and microfabrication have led to the development of various micro/nanorobots (MNRs), including nano swimmers, nano engines, and biologically inspired microbats [4]. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning is enhancing the capabilities of nanorobots in navigation, targeting, and payload delivery across the BBB without causing damage or toxicity [1, 2]. Although promising for conditions such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, a systematic investigation of nanorobots' behavior, biocompatibility, and efficacy is essential prior to clinical evaluations.\nIn addition to neurological applications, nanorobots are making strides in cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly in targeting brain cancer cells [5]. These nanoscale devices, ranging from 0.1 to 10 micrometers, can navigate the bloodstream, detect cancer cells, and deliver targeted drug therapies [6]. Their ability to cross biological barriers, including the BBB, allows them to reach previously inaccessible areas [5]. Advanced designs are incorporating glucose-based cancer detectors and drug-releasing mechanisms activated by electrical signals [6]. The potential of nanorobotics extends beyond cancer treatment to various medical applications, including heart diseases, diabetes, and kidney disorders [7]. Ongoing research is focused on developing autonomous computational nanorobots for in vivo medical diagnosis and treatment [6]."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Biomarker Detection and Density Calculation", "content": "The movement of nanorobots in this simulation is driven by biomarker gradients. Biomarkers are biological molecules associated with tumor cells that diffuse outward into surrounding tissue. Nanorobots detect the concentration of these biomarkers and use this information to locate cancer cells. The biomarker density at any given point follows a Gaussian distribution, which serves as a realistic model for how concentration diminishes with distance from the source.\nThe biomarker concentration p (x, y, z) at any position (x, y, z) is modeled as:\n$p(x, y, z) = p_0 exp \\left(-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2 + (z - z_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$\nWhere:\n\u2022 po is the peak concentration at the source (cancer cell location),\n\u2022 (xo, yo, zo) denotes the coordinates of the biomarker source,\n\u2022 \u03c3 represents the spread of the biomarker concentration.\nThis distribution allows the nanorobots to detect the highest concentration near the source and lower concentrations as they move away. By following the gradient, nanorobots are naturally led toward cancer cells."}, {"title": "2.2 Gradient-Based Navigation", "content": "To move effectively toward cancer cells, nanorobots leverage the gradient of biomarker density in their environment. Biomarkers are biological molecules that can signal the presence of cancer cells, and their concentration can vary significantly within a given area. The nanorobots calculate the density of these biomarkers, denoted as p (x, y, z), to determine their spatial distribution. The nanorobots use the partial derivatives of the biomarker density function with respect to spatial coordinates (x, y, z) to compute the gradients, which are represented by the following equations:\n$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{(x - x_0)}{\\sigma^2}p(x, y, z)$\n$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{(y - y_0)}{\\sigma^2}p(x, y, z)$\n$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{(z-z_0)}{\\sigma^2}p(x, y, z)$\nIn these equations:\n\u2022 (xo, yo, zo) represents the coordinates of the source of the biomarker concentration (e.g., the location of cancer cells).\n\u2022 \u03c3\u00b2is a parameter that reflects the spread or dispersion of the biomarker signal in space, affecting how quickly the concentration decreases with distance from the source.\nThe calculated gradients $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$ indicate the rate and direction of change of the biomarker concentration in three-dimensional space. Specifically, these gradients show the direction in which the concentration of biomarkers increases most rapidly. By continuously measuring these gradients, the nanorobots can adjust their movement accordingly. If, for example, the gradient in the x-direction is positive, it indicates that moving in the positive x-direction will lead the nanorobots toward areas of higher biomarker concentration. This adaptive movement allows the nanorobots to efficiently follow the concentration slope toward the source of biomarkers, enabling them to navigate directly to cancer cells. This approach not only enhances the effectiveness of the nanorobots in locating cancer cells but also reduces the time and energy spent on navigating through the surrounding tissue. By optimizing their trajectory based on real-time biomarker concentration data, nanorobots can play a crucial role in targeted cancer therapies and diagnostic procedures, ultimately improving treatment outcomes. These gradients indicate the direction in which biomarker concentration increases most rapidly. By adjusting their position according to the calculated gradient, nanorobots efficiently follow the concentration slope toward the source, enabling direct navigation to cancer cells."}, {"title": "2.3 Reinforcement Learning for Path Optimization", "content": "While the biomarker density gradient provides directional cues, nanorobots further refine their movement strategy through reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning algorithms allow the nanorobots to adapt to the environment by maximizing cumulative reward.

This environment includes several critical components:\n\u2022 Biomarkers: Chemical substances that indicate the presence of cancer cells and serve as guides for the nanorobots.\n\u2022 Cancer Cells: Randomly distributed throughout the space and serving as primary targets for the nanorobots.\n\u2022 Obstacles: Represent biological barriers that nanorobots must navigate around.\nInitially, nanorobots start from random positions within the environment. Their primary movement strategy involves navigating toward areas with higher concentrations of biomarkers, indicating the proximity of cancer cells. Obstacles in the simulation are generated randomly within the three-dimensional environment, mimicking the unpredictable and complex nature of real biological environments. These obstacles represent biological barriers that nanorobots might encounter, such as dense tissue, blood vessels, or cellular structures. By introducing randomly placed obstacles, the simulation reflects the variability and challenges nanorobots would face in actual physiological conditions.

The update rule is defined as:\n$Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha [r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a') \u2013 Q(s, a)]$\nWhere Q(s, a) is the action-value function for state s and action a, \u03b1 is the learning rate, r is the reward received after taking action a in state s, \u03b3 is the discount factor, s' is the new state after taking action a. And $\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q (s', a')$ is the maximum Q-value over all possible actions a'in the next state of s'.\n\u2022 Current Q-value (Q(s, a)): This is the existing estimate of the value of taking action a in the current state s. The Q-value represents the expected cumulative reward an agent can achieve by choosing a in s, assuming it continues to make optimal decisions thereafter.\n\u2022 Reward (r): r is the immediate reward the agent receives after taking action a in state s. This reward directly influences how the Q-value is updated, encouraging the agent to repeat actions that yield high rewards.\n\u2022 Future Q-value ($\\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$): $\\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ represents the maximum estimated Q-value in the new state s' (after taking action a in s). By taking the maximum, the agent optimistically assumes that it will take the best possible future action, encouraging it to select actions that lead to states with high potential for reward.\n\u2022 Learning Rate (\u03b1): \u03b1 (0 < a < 1) controls the rate at which the agent updates its Q-values. A high \u03b1 means the agent gives more weight to new information, while a low \u03b1 means it relies more on past knowledge.\n\u2022 Discount Factor (\u03b3): \u03b3 (0 \u2264 y \u2264 1) determines how much future rewards are valued compared to immediate rewards. A higher y makes the agent value long-term rewards, whereas a lower y makes it focus more on immediate rewards.\nThe agent updates Q(s, a) by adding the difference between the expected reward (based on current information) and the old estimate. This update pushes Q(s, a) closer to the \"true\" value based on the reward and future optimal Q-values. The agent repeatedly applies this formula during its interactions, gradually improving its Q-values to reflect the best possible actions in each state. Over time, the agent learns an optimal policy, maximizing its cumulative reward by choosing actions that lead to high future rewards.\nThe reward function is defined as follows:\nr=\n$\\begin{cases} +10 & \\text{if a cancer cell is reached} \\\\ -1 & \\text{if an obstacle is hit} \\\\ +1 & \\text{for every unit moved toward a biomarker} \\end{cases}$\nThe simulation iterates over numerous episodes, tracking the movements of nanorobots as they navigate toward cancer cells. Q-learning is a powerful reinforcement learning algorithm that enhances the decision-making capabilities of nanorobots in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Unlike rule-based methods, which struggle to adapt to new conditions, Q-learning enables nanorobots to learn from their experiences by updating Q-values based on rewards received during interactions with their surroundings. This ability allows them to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation, optimizing their strategies over time. Additionally, Q-learning equips nanorobots with the flexibility to quickly respond to environmental changes and identify the most efficient paths toward their targets, such as cancer cells, thereby improving their overall effectiveness in complex tasks."}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "The following metrics and visualizations were used to assess the nanorobot's performance, efficiency, and effectiveness in targeting the cancer cell through a challenging environment with biomarker concentrations and obstacles.

As nanorobots navigate through their environments, they encounter various conditions and challenges, such as the presence of cancer cells, biomarker gradients, and obstacles. Each time a nanorobot takes an action, it receives feedback in the form of a reward, which is used to adjust the Q-values associated with its current state and action. These updates reflect the effectiveness of the actions taken, allowing the nanorobots to learn which paths lead to successful outcomes\u2014such as reaching cancer cells-while avoiding detrimental situations, like collisions with obstacles. Over time, the Q-values converge to represent the expected long-term rewards for different actions in specific states, leading to the development of an optimal policy.

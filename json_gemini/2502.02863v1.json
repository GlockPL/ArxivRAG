Through a between-subjects experiment (N=900), we compared three conditions: (1) Static Scientific Information, providing conventional environmental education through text and images; (2) Static Character Narrative, featuring first-person storytelling from 3D-rendered marine creatures; and (3) Conversational Character Narrative, enabling real-time dialogue with AI-powered marine characters. Our analysis revealed that the Conversational Character Narrative condition significantly increased behavioral intentions and sustainable choice preferences compared to static approaches. The beluga whale character demonstrated consistently stronger emotional engagement across multiple measures, including perceived anthropomorphism and empathy. However, impacts on deeper measures like climate policy support and psychological distance were limited, highlighting the complexity of shifting entrenched beliefs.

Despite mounting scientific evidence and growing public awareness, the gap between environmental knowledge and action remains a persistent challenge in addressing climate change [30].\nDava Newman, former Deputy Administrator of NASA, once remarked that Earth needs ambassadors-voices that can speak for our planet and its diverse inhabitants in the face of unprecedented environmental challenges. This provocative idea takes on new relevance in our age of AI. What if we could create Earth ambassadors that give voice to non-human perspectives?\nThe world's oceans face an unprecedented crisis as plastic pollution continues to surge, threatening marine ecosystems on a global scale [16]. Recent quantitative assessments reveal that by 2022, approximately 139 million tonnes of plastic have accumulated in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, with documented adverse effects on marine biodiversity, including reproductive disruption in aquatic species and agricultural impacts [8, 34, 37, 38]. Furthermore, emerging research has identified microplastic particles in human circulatory systems, correlating with elevated risks of cardiovascular events and other physiological complications [32].\nDespite extensive literature on sustainability messaging and pro-environmental behavior (PEB) interventions, some conventional methodologies demonstrate first promising results, while others are still limited in their effectiveness - especially in the long-term [7, 22, 36]. Traditional environmental education methods often struggle to evoke the emotional resonance required to catalyze meaningful, long-term behavioral change [33].\nRecent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs) and conversational AI, present new opportunities for addressing these challenges. These technologies offer the potential to create dynamic, personalized environmental narratives that might help bridge the gap between human experience and marine conservation. However, they also raise important questions about representation, authenticity, and the ethical implications of simulating non-human perspectives.\nDrawing on Haraway's seminal work on multispecies relationships and her concept of \"making kin\" with non-human species, we explore how technological interventions can reshape human-ocean connections [23]. Haraway's framework of companion species offers valuable insights into how humans might develop more meaningful relationships with marine ecosystems through technological mediation. Building on these theoretical foundations, we present OceanChat, an interactive system featuring AI-generated marine characters designed to foster environmental awareness and sustainable behaviors. By providing engaging, character-driven conversations, OceanChat seeks to bridge the gap between environmental awareness and pro-environmental behavior. While acknowledging that AI cannot truly capture or represent marine life perspectives, we investigate how these characters might serve as Newman's envisioned Earth ambassadors, giving voice to marine species in the crucial work of environmental education and advocacy.\nThis approach builds on recent HCI research examining how conversational agents can support environmental engagement [6, 20, 25] while extending it through the integration of advanced conversational AI and species-specific character design. Prior work has explored various approaches to environmental communication through technology, from eco-feedback systems providing real-time energy consumption data to gamified sustainability interfaces encouraging pro-environmental behaviors [25, 43]. Research has also examined the role of emotional connection in environmental advocacy and the use of anthropomorphism in conservation messaging [35, 42]. Interactive technologies have shown promise in creating more engaging environmental experiences, as demonstrated by virtual reality applications for ocean acidification awareness and mobile apps for citizen science initiatives [14, 29].\nHowever, while these studies have advanced our understanding of environmental communication through technology, there remains a critical gap in examining how scalable solutions incorporating advanced conversational AI and species-specific character design can create more personalized and emotionally resonant environmental engagement experiences. Most existing approaches rely on static information delivery, specialized hardware, or limited interactivity, potentially missing opportunities for widespread, accessible engagement through mobile and web platforms. Building on these theoretical foundations and technological capabilities, we conducted a mixed-methods study examining how interactions with three different marine characters-a beluga whale, jellyfish, and seahorse-influenced participants' environmental attitudes and actions. These species were selected to represent diverse forms of marine life with varying degrees of charisma and anthropomorphic potential. Our experimental design compared three conditions: (1) traditional scientific narratives with static marine life images, representing conventional environmental education approaches, (2) first-person narratives from marine creatures with virtual characters but no interaction, exploring the impact of character-driven storytelling, and (3) OceanChat's interactive Al-generated marine characters with conversational capabilities, investigating the potential of dynamic, engaging communication efforts.\nIn alignment with our sustainability ethos, we critically assessed the environmental impact of our intervention, ensuring that its implementation adheres to responsible AI practices. This research makes three primary contributions to the fields of human-computer interaction, behavioral psychology, and environmental communication:"}, {"title": "(1) Empirical Insights into Character Design and Pro-Environmental Behavior", "content": "Our study provides robust quantitative and qualitative evidence (N=900) on how marine species and interaction modalities influence environmental attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. Key findings reveal that character-driven narratives-particularly those utilizing interactive conversational agents-are effective in fostering pro-environmental engagement, though their impact varies across species and perceptual dimensions. The study highlights the role of factors such as perceived anthropomorphism, animacy, and empathy in mediating these effects, offering a nuanced understanding of the interplay between design elements and aspects of pro-environmental behavior."}, {"title": "(2) Design Principles for AI-Generated Environmental Characters", "content": "We propose actionable design principles for creating effective AI-generated characters for environmental education. These principles emphasize balancing anthropomorphic features with authentic species representation to maximize emotional connection while maintaining ecological credibility. The concept of \"graduated anthropomorphism\" is introduced, recommending context-specific adjustments in character design to align with interaction goals. Additionally, we outline strategies for leveraging emotional scaffolding and contextual resonance to create immersive, persuasive interactions."}, {"title": "(3) Synhetic pre-evaluation of Study", "content": "OceanChat underwent a synthetic pre-evaluation-a novel approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) to simulate diverse participant interactions and provide detailed feedback before deploying the system to human users. By integrating synthetic reviewers, the study introduces a rigorous pre-testing layer that enhances the reliability and validity of the final intervention, setting a precedent for incorporating LLM-driven pre-evaluation in behavioral and sustainability research.\nOur research extends HCI work on persuasive interfaces for pro-environmental behavior while providing practical guidelines for incorporating AI-generated characters in environmental education. More broadly, it contributes to ongoing discussions about the role of Al in mediating human relationships with the natural world, offering insights into how technological interventions might support rather than supplant direct environmental connection and responsibility."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "As sustainability challenges become increasingly urgent, researchers have turned to interactive Al systems-especially those powered by large language models (LLMs)-as potentially powerful drivers of pro-environmental behavior. Below, we situate our work within two key areas of prior research: the emerging role of LLMs in persuasive interactions for (pro-environmental) behavior change and methodological considerations that incorporate both real and synthetic participants."}, {"title": "2.1 LLMs and Persuasive Interactions for Sustainability", "content": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has not only transformed how individuals interact with AI-exemplified by platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT-but has also opened new avenues for influencing environmental knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. By leveraging principles from behavioral science and persuasive design, these conversational systems can adapt messages in real-time to address individual misconceptions and motivations through personalized interactions [15, 19, 20]. In parallel, advancements in behavioral psychology have revealed promising strategies for fostering sustainable behavior. Psychological methods such as leveraging dynamic social norms, goal setting, and emotionally resonant storytelling have demonstrated the potential to motivate individuals towards adopting pro-environmental habits [1, 6, 18, 47]. When integrated into AI-driven interfaces, these approaches can be deployed at scale to offer tailored suggestions that strengthen users' sense of self-efficacy and commitment to environmental goals, thereby contributing to broader sustainability efforts.\nEmpirical research increasingly demonstrates these systems' ability to shift beliefs across diverse contexts. For instance, LLM-powered agents have been shown to counteract misinformation and conspiracy theories, guide users toward healthier behaviors, and enhance education effectiveness [2, 9, 48]. Through iterative dialogue, chatbots can tailor feedback to users' specific barriers-such as time constraints or skepticism-thereby enhancing both the persuasiveness and relevance of pro-environmental messages [2, 19].\nBuilding on these insights, OceanChat explores how LLM-driven conversations might create richer, more empathic connections with marine ecosystems than static or one-way interventions. While prior studies confirm the efficacy of conversational agents for changing attitudes, less is known about how fully embodied, character-based narratives might deepen engagement with-and commitment to-sustainability goals.\nRecent experiments underscore the importance of multi-strategy approaches. For instance, Costello et al. found that short, tailored interventions generated through GPT-4 Turbo significantly diminished conspiracy-theory beliefs over time, illustrating how fact-based appeals can complement empathy-building dialogues [9]. Meanwhile, Giudici's chatbot delivering energy-saving tips combined multiple persuasive cues (e.g., social comparisons, immediate feedback) to improve user engagement, though the translation to actual behavior varied [20].\nTaken together, these findings suggest that effective sustainability interventions often blend factual content with emotional resonance and interactive affordances. In the marine conservation domain, such hybrid approaches could be particularly beneficial, as users' emotional connection to non-human life forms is a key driver of behavior change. With OceanChat, we extend this line of inquiry by using first-person, AI-generated marine characters to evoke empathy, frame scientific consensus on climate impacts, and deliver context-aware guidance on sustainability practices."}, {"title": "2.2 Methodological Considerations: Real and Synthetic Participants", "content": "Designing and testing novel AI interventions at scale raises unique methodological questions. While human-subject experiments remain the gold standard for measuring authentic behavioral and attitudinal change, LLM-based synthetic pilot studies have emerged as a complementary technique [26, 31]. By simulating participants from different demographic backgrounds, researchers can pre-test interventions for potential flaws, refine prompts for clarity, and evaluate initial user flows before deploying a system to a larger pool of human participants.\nWe adopt this dual approach, integrating a synthetic pilot study with our eventual human-subject trial. In doing so, we first tested OceanChat's conversational prompts, ensuring the characters' personalities, narrative tone, and factual accuracy met our design goals. Synthetic participants flagged potential pitfalls-such as confusing transitions or underexplained technical terms-that might reduce the intervention's effectiveness. After refining these elements, we proceeded to test the system with real participants, allowing us to focus on genuine emotional engagement and reported behavior change rather than debugging user-flow issues.\nBy combining LLM-based research techniques, best practices in persuasive design, and real-user testing, OceanChat investigates how conversational AI agents can drive deeper, more lasting pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. This dual-method strategy ensures robust study design while capitalizing on the rapid iteration possible through LLM-driven synthetic pilots."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "The methodology of this study was designed to explore the potential of Al-driven conversational agents in fostering pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors.

Our research question specifically focuses on comparing the effectiveness of interactive Al agents versus static methods in communicating about climate change. The methodology addresses this question through randomized controlled experiments that isolate the effects of interactivity while maintaining consistent environmental messaging across all participant groups."}, {"title": "3.1 Study Design", "content": "This paper is using a between-subjects design with three experimental conditions:\n\u2022 \"Static Scientific Information\": A text-based intervention presenting a succinct scientific excerpt and a supporting image of a marine animal.\n\u2022 \"Static Character Narrative\": A text-based intervention featuring a personal story from the animals perspective, accompanied by an animated 3D model.\n\u2022 \"Conversational Character Narrative\": An interactive, chat-based intervention that provides a personal animal narrative, coupled with an animated 3D model offering real-time dialogue.\nWithin each of these three conditions, the study incorporates an additional layer of even randomization by featuring one of three maritime characters: Three-Spot seahorses, Moon Jellyfish, or Beluga Whales. These species were chosen because they are either endangered or significantly affected by climate change and plastic pollution [10, 40, 49]. This nested randomization allows researchers to examine whether the effectiveness of each presentation format varies depending on the featured species.\nThis comprehensive design enables us to investigate multiple factors: how different presentation formats affect engagement and learning, whether certain marine species resonate more strongly with participants, and if there are any interesting interactions between the presentation format and the featured species. The between-subjects approach ensures clean data collection without the confounding effects that might arise from participants experiencing multiple conditions."}, {"title": "3.2 Chatbot Design", "content": "The OceanChat chatbot design combines behavioral psychology principles with cutting-edge technical implementation to create engaging, character-driven interactions that promote pro-environmental behavior."}, {"title": "3.2.1 Behavioral Design.", "content": "In OceanChat, each interaction with a marine character begins with the character narrating a short, vivid story about their life, challenges, and the impacts of plastic pollution or climate change.

Each response by the character integrates the user's input, builds on their message with oceanic anecdotes, and uses behavioral psychology principles to nudge pro-environmental behavior. Responses are concise (2-3 sentences) and end with a reflective question to sustain engagement. After the third user input, the conversation concludes with a brief, urgent, and hopeful call to action, emphasizing marine protection and sustainable practices.

All experimental conditions-static information, static narrative, and Al-driven conversational narrative-were implemented within a single, unified interface, thus ensuring consistent visual design and interaction across conditions.\nIn the character conditions, the animation controller managed a comprehensive library of character-specific behaviors, including ambient movements, conversational gestures, and emotional expressions. Three-dimensional marine life models were rendered through Google's model-viewer, which provided hardware-accelerated WebGL rendering and sophisticated materials handling [27]. The viewer was extended with custom shaders to achieve realistic underwater effects.

This phase consisted of two stages: an interaction stage with simulated users and a subsequent review stage to assess conversation quality.\nIn the interaction stage, we deployed 100 large language model (LLM) agents, each prompted as a human with distinct conversational traits, to engage with OceanChat's Conversational Narrative condition. These agents generated a substantial dataset of interactions, allowing us to evaluate the system's ability to maintain consistent and meaningful dialogue across varied conversational paths. The dependent variable Sustainable Consumption was simulated as the primary focus of this phase.\nThe synthetic results, depicted in Figure 5, reveal notable differences between the responses of synthetic agents and real participants. In the pre-intervention phase, the synthetic data produced a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic of 0.378133 (p < 0.001), indicating a statistically significant divergence from the real data. Post-intervention, the KS statistic decreased to 0.240819 (p < 0.001), suggesting a reduced, yet still meaningful, discrepancy. Moreover, the overall change from pre- to post-intervention yielded a KS statistic of 0.449195 (p < 0.001), highlighting the challenges inherent in fully replicating human responses with synthetic agents.\nComplementing the KS analysis, we computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between the binned histogram densities of the real and synthetic responses for each question. These correlations ranged from approximately 0.20 to 0.93. Notably, for some questions the high correlations (up to 0.93) indicate that, despite significant KS differences, the synthetic responses capture the overall trend of the real data. Conversely, lower correlations (around 0.20) underscore substantial differences in distribution shape. Together, the KS statistics and correlation coefficients provide a nuanced view: while the KS test confirms statistically significant differences between the datasets, the degree of similarity-as measured by correlation-is highly question-dependent, informing both the limitations and the potential of synthetic data for refining prompting techniques.\nFollowing the interaction stage, we conducted an extensive review process involving 300 additional LLM agents, tasked with evaluating various aspects of the conversations. These reviewers assessed emotional engagement, prompt adherence, motivational effectiveness, and behavioral impact. As shown in Table 1, the reviewers reported stronger performance across all metrics when considering complete conversation threads (All Messages) compared to isolated final responses (Last Message).

Notably, neither education level nor location demonstrated significant effects on climate change beliefs, indicating that the intervention's impact transcended these demographic factors.\nWhen examining the animal conditions, neither the jellyfish (\u03b2 = 0.673, p = 0.244) nor seahorse (\u03b2 = 0.783, p = 0.157) conditions showed significant differences compared to the baseline, suggesting that the"}]}

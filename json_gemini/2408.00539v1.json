Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as multi-turn\ndialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional attention on prefix\nsequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent inefficient training problem in\nmulti-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the attention mechanism of prefix LLM\nmakes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV Cache) across dialogue rounds to\nreduce generation latency. In this paper, we propose a novel masking scheme called\nIntermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to address these problems. Specifically, we\napply alternate bidirectional and unidirectional attention on queries and answers\nin the dialogue history. In this way, ISM is able to maintain the high quality of\nprefix LLM and low generation latency of causal LLM, simultaneously.

Due to the powerful generation\ncapability, LLMs have made remarkable achievements in different kinds of Natural Language Process\n(NLP) tasks through a unified generative paradigm. Specifically, the most natural and common way\nto interact with LLMs is through multi-turn dialogues. However, as the number of dialogue rounds\nincreases, ensuring high quality and low latency of the generated answer by LLMs is a challenge.\nExisting language models can be grouped into three categories according to framework architecture:\nEncoder-Decoder Vaswani et al.

Given a multi-turn dialogue sample including the prompt (P =\n\\((x_1,\u2026\u2026, x_{mp})\\)), queries \\(Q_i = (x_{mp+1} or x_{ma_{i-1}+1},\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, x_{mq_i} ), i = 1,\u2026, n\\)) and answers(A\u1d62 =\n\\((x_{mq_{i} +1},..., x_{ma_i}), i = 1,\u2026\u2026, n \u2212 1)\\), that is [P, Q\u2081, A\u2081,\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5, Q\u2099\u208b\u2081, A\u2099\u208b\u2081, Q\u2099]. The goal of the\nmodel is to predict A\u2099 of Q\u2099 using the context [P, Q\u2081, A\u2081, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, Q\u2099\u208b\u2081, A\u2099\u208b\u2081].\nThe most classic form of attention is categorized as full (or bidirectional) attention, shown in equation\n3.2, in which each input x\u2c7c (j = 1,\u2026\u2026, n) can attend to all positions. Full attention is typically used\nin the transformer encoder.\nFurthermore, another transformer decoder for in-context learning uses the auto-regressive attention\n\\[x_j \\leftarrow x_j + PV\\sum_{i=1}^{j}x_i(x_i^K Qx_j)\\]\nwhich restricts each token x\u1d62 to attend only to previous positions (and itself) from 1 to j. This\nrestriction is due to the role of the decoder as a causal language model (causal LLM) which predicts\nthe next token in the context of the previously generated ones.\nThe original transformer uses a full attention based encoder and an auto-regressive attention based\ndecoder. However, NLP researchers have a preference for models that are either encoder-only (e.g.\nBERTDevlin et al. [2019]) or decoder-only (e.g. GPTRadford et al. [2018], Brown et al. [2020],\nPaLMChowdhery et al. [2023], Anil et al. [2023]) according to the task at hand. One motivation for\naltering model is that it reduces the number of parameters by half.\nA new form of attention, that lies intermediate to full attention and auto-regressive attention, emerged\nfrom the understanding that certain tasks can gain advantages from a prefix sequence, such as\nmulti-turn dialogue and in-context learning. This attention in prefix LLM suggests the following:\n\\[x_j \\leftarrow x_j+PV \\sum_{i=1}^{max(j,n_{qn})} x_i(x_i^KQx_i)\\]\nWhere max(j, nqn) ensures each prefix token x\u2c7c with j < nqn can attend to all prefix tokens.\nIn our ISM, the form of which suggests the following:\n\\[x_j\\leftarrow x_j + PV\\sum_{i=1}^{f(j)} x_i(x_i^KQx_j)\\]\nwhere f(j) is\n\\[f(j) =\\begin{cases}mq_1 & \\text{for } j <= mq_1\\\\mq_k & \\text{for } ma_{k-1} <j<=mq_k, k > 1\\\\j & \\text{for } mq_k < j <= ma_k, k >= 1,\\end{cases}\\]"}, {"title": "3.2 Convergence in Multi-turn dialogue learning", "content": "To simplify the model in Multi-turn dialogue learning, we analyze Linear regression, which is a\nclassical machine learning problem.

Introduction", "content": "Quantitative investment (quant) involves financial investment strategies driven by mathematical, statistical, or machine learning models, and it uses powerful computers execute trading instructions derived from quant models at speeds and frequencies unattainable by human traders. In particular, deep learning techniques are widely applied in quant modeling, such as stock/futures trend prediction [1, 2, 3, 4], stock selection [5, 6, 7], portfolio optimization [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and algorithmic trading [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nThe traditional quantitative research paradigm is fraught with several limitations. First, it adheres to a comprehensive pipeline that includes data processing, factor mining, machine learning, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. Each of these steps demands significant research resources, including intensive labor and substantial time to identify effective \"alphas.\" Furthermore, the optimization objectives across these pipeline stages often lack consistency, leading to suboptimal outcomes for the final trading strategy. Additionally, traditional task-specific quantitative modeling relies heavily on pre-defined scenarios, strategy tasks, and associated data, making it difficult to transfer these models directly to other strategy tasks. This reliance on \"local\" data not only limits the model's potential but also exacerbates research costs, as quants are compelled to develop a distinct model for each strategy.\nIn recent years, the rapid advancements in artificial general intelligence (AGI) have provided a unique opportunity to transform the quantitative research paradigm. Specifically, we discuss the shift toward a new modeling paradigm aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of quantitative finance research. First, there is a clear transition from traditional multifactor modeling to state-of-the-art end-to-end modeling. Unlike multifactor modeling, which builds trading strategies incrementally through a research pipeline, end-to-end modeling seeks to directly generate the final trading strategy, bypassing intermediate steps such as factor mining, and producing predicted alphas, optimal positions, or even algorithmic trading orders. This approach has the potential to eliminate the labor-intensive factor mining process and significantly enhance the efficiency of quantitative research. Second, the shift from traditional task-specific modeling to universal modeling, akin to the \"pretrained foundation model + fine-tuned task model\" approach commonly used in large language models, is becoming increasingly prominent in quantitative investment. The foundation model, typically a universal model trained on a broad and diverse dataset (e.g., data spanning various countries, security markets, and trading assets), can be fine-tuned to optimize specific trading strategies. By combining the strengths of end-to-end modeling and universal modeling, we propose the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel methodological framework for quantitative investment research."}, {"title": "2. Review on Quantitative Investment", "content": "Quantitative Investment relies on automated strategies built on various data to trade different instruments such as stocks, futures, bonds and options. This section briefly introduces common quantitative investment strategies and diverse data used for building these strategies. In addition, we introduce the classic multi-factor modeling which is wide used in quantitative investment."}, {"title": "2.1. Quant Strategies", "content": "A quantitative strategy is a systematic function or trading methodology used for trading financial instruments, such as stocks, options, and futures, in financial markets. These strategies are based on either predefined rules or trained models for making trading decisions and are typically the core intellectual property of a trading firm. A standard quantitative strategy should specify several configurations, such as the universe of financial instruments to be traded, the average holding period, and the trading frequency. Additionally, it should define the type of strategies employed.\n\u2022 Directional trading is a strategy used in financial markets that involves taking a position based on the anticipated direction of a security's price movement and profiting from these price changes by buying or selling securities accordingly. Popular directional trading strategies include trend following (identifying and following the direction of an existing trend, taking long positions in uptrends and short positions in downtrends), breakout trading (taking positions when the price decisively moves beyond support or resistance levels, with long positions on bullish breakouts and short positions on bearish breakouts), and contrarian trading (trading against the market trend by identifying overbought or oversold conditions and taking reverse positions).\n\u2022 Long-short trading, commonly used in hedge funds, is an investment strategy that involves taking both long and short positions in different securities to exclude market volatility effects (the \"Beta\" return) from the overall return and to profit from the \"Alpha\" return. A popular example is stock long-short selection, which predicts the \"best\" stocks to buy (long) and the \"worst\u201d stocks to sell (short) at each cross-section over time.\n\u2022 Arbitrage trading is a strategy that exploits price discrepancies between different markets or financial instruments to achieve risk-free profits. Common arbitrage strategies include cross-exchange arbitrage (profiting from price discrepancies of a security across various exchanges), triangle arbitrage (typically used in forex and cryptocurrency markets to exploit exchange rate discrepancies by trading three different currencies), calendar spread arbitrage (for futures), convertible arbitrage (taking a long position in a convertible bond while shorting its underlying stock), and statistical arbitrage (trading pairs of correlated securities by longing the underpriced one and shorting the overpriced one).\n\u2022 Market making trading is a family of high-frequency strategies that provide liquidity to financial markets by continuously quoting both buy (bid) and sell (ask) prices for financial instruments, aiming to profit from the spread between these prices. For instance, a market maker might quote a bid price of $100 and an ask price of $100.10 for a stock. The market maker buys shares from a trader willing to sell at $100 and sells them to another trader willing to buy at $100.10, thereby profiting from the spread.\nAdditionally, trading frequency defines the duration for which assets are held in a portfolio and how often trades are executed. High-frequency trading typically involves holding positions for a few minutes or seconds, whereas low-frequency trading may involve holding assets for several months or years. The significant difference in holding periods between high-frequency and low-frequency trading leads to distinct considerations in strategy design. For example, asset capacity limitations and trading costs are critical issues in high-frequency trading, while managing drawdown risk is a primary concern in low-frequency trading."}, {"title": "2.2. Data Diversity in Quant Modeling", "content": "Modern quantitative investment harnesses a diverse array of data to develop statistical and machine learning strategies aimed at profitable trading. Data depth refers to the granularity of data, which can span from several years at the macro level to mere nanoseconds at the micro level. Data breadth, on the other hand, indicates the diversity of the data, encompassing quote data (such as price/volume, limit order book (LOB) data, and market order flow), fundamental data (including financial statements, investment research reports, company announcements, and analysts' opinions), and a broad range of alternative data (such as e-commerce transactions, credit card/e-payment transactions, news and social media comments, satellite imagery, foot traffic, and supply chain data).\nDifferent investment strategies rely on different types of financial data. For instance, high-frequency market-making strategies [18] focus on data depth by modeling granular LOB data to predict price movements over very short horizons. Horizontal spread arbitrage strategies [19] utilize minute-bar quote data, seeking to capitalize on price discrepancies in derivatives contracts (such as options or futures) with varying expiration dates. Stock technical trading strategies [20] employ candlestick data (open, high, low, close prices) and trading volumes to generate buy/sell signals. Meanwhile, stock fundamental investing strategies [21] analyze financial statements, analyst reports, and news data to evaluate the fundamental health and intrinsic value of public companies.\nThe rapid growth of internet and mobile technologies over the past decade has led to an explosion in the accumulation of big data. Financial institutions are increasingly integrating alternative data, such as credit card transaction data, web traffic data, and geolocation data, into their fundamental analysis and value investing strategies [22, 23]. This shift has significantly expanded the data breadth available for quantitative investment, enabling more comprehensive and nuanced analyses."}, {"title": "2.3. Multifactor Quant Modeling", "content": "The quantitative research pipeline comprises several critical stages, including data processing, factor mining, alpha modeling, portfolio position optimization, and order execution optimization. Among these stages, factor mining is particularly vital, as the quality of the factors significantly influences the performance of the alpha model, which subsequently impacts the overall returns of the final portfolio.\nFactors are typically mathematical formulas or functions that capture signals predictive of trends in various financial instruments, such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. These factors can be derived from a wide range of data sources, including: (1) financial quote data, such as price, volume, and limit order book (LOB) information; (2) fundamental data, such as financial statements and research reports; and (3) alternative data sources [24], including credit card transactions, social media commentary, product reviews, satellite imagery, geolocation and climate data, shipping trackers, mobile app usage data, and news feeds.\nTraditionally, trading factors have been manually designed and constructed, relying heavily on market observations and the expertise of traders. However, there has been a growing shift toward the use of automatic factor mining techniques, such as genetic programming [25], to improve the efficiency of factor construction and selection. Whether manually crafted or algorithmically discovered, these factors undergo rigorous back-testing. Only those factors that are both effective (\"good\") and non-correlated (\u201cdiverse\") are retained and stored in the database for use in alpha modeling."}, {"title": "3. Large Investment Models", "content": "The rapid advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI) [26] in recent years has prompted a re-evaluation of the future trajectory of quantitative investment technology. Two pivotal aspects of AGI are end-to-end modeling and universal modeling. Notably, the success of GPT-like models [27, 28] has highlighted the extraordinary potential of self-supervised generative learning [29], which is grounded in a universal \u201cnext-token prediction\u201d task. In this paradigm, a general-purpose foundation model is pre-trained on extensive datasets, and through appropriate fine-tuning [30] for specific tasks, the model's predictive power is significantly enhanced, often surpassing models that were specialized from the outset for those tasks.\nThis success invites an intriguing question: could the \"pre-training + fine-tuning\" paradigm be effectively applied to quantitative strategy research? If a robust foundational model [31] for quantitative investment can discover transferable trading patterns and investment logic across various instruments and markets, then quantitative strategy research might be reconceived as a fine-tuning task tailored to specific strategy requirements and investment scenarios. Such a paradigm shift could dramatically increase research efficiency in the field."}, {"title": "3.1. End-to-End Modeling for LIM", "content": "Since factors are essentially \"features\" that characterize instruments, their information is entirely derived from the original data. A natural question arises: can we build a predictive model without explicitly creating factors? The advent of deep learning and the end-to-end training paradigm presents a plausible technical route. End-to-end training refers to a modeling approach that directly learns the complex function linking raw inputs to final outputs, encompassing all intermediate stages. Consider the example of data-to-position modeling, where the tasks of alpha generation and optimal position determination are integrated within a single deep learning model. There are several methods available for directly outputting position sizes. One such method involves calculating Markowitz-optimal position sizes [32] based on ground-truth returns and using these computed values as labels for training the deep learning model. Another approach frames the reinforcement learning reward function in terms of the portfolio's Sharpe ratio, which is derived from the predicted position sizes. This subsection explores a third technical approach: designing a novel loss function for deep learning, based on the predicted portfolio Sharpe ratio, to directly determine the optimal position sizes. This method enables the deep learning model to learn the optimal portfolio allocation by optimizing a loss function that directly reflects the trade-off between return and risk, as quantified by the Sharpe ratio. Such an approach has the potential to improve portfolio performance by allowing the model to focus on maximizing the risk-adjusted return throughout the training process. Mathematically, suppose we have a universe of m stocks, each with a record of n time points. Let $r_{t,s}$ and $w_{t,s}$ $(1 \\le t \\le T \\text{ and } 1 < s < S)$ denote the return and position size of stock s at time point t, respectively. The portfolio return at time point t is $r_t = \\sum_{s=1}^{S} w_{t,s}r_{t,s}$. Let $r = \\{r_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$ represent a sequence of n portfolio returns over time, then the negative logarithmic Sharpe ratio of the portfolio can be defined as:\n\n$L(X|w, \\Theta) = -log(E(r)) + log(\\sigma(r))$\\qquad(1)\n\nThis serves as the loss for the end-to-end deep learning quant model. Note that r depends on $r_{t,s}$, which is a function of the input data sequence $X = \\{x_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{T}$, position $w = \\{w_1,w_2, ..., w_m\\}$ (m is the number of stocks in the universe), and deep neural network parameters $\\Theta$. Since $L(X|w, \\Theta)$ is a differentiable function of w and $\\Theta$, we can build an end-to-end neural network with this loss function to output the optimal portfolio positions corresponding to an optimal Sharpe ratio on the training data.\nRecent literature has seen a growing interest in this area, with notable contributions such as Deep Inception Networks (DINs) [12] and End-to-End Active Investment (E2EAI)[33]. DINs introduce end-to-end systematic trading strategies by extracting time-series and cross-sectional features directly from daily price returns, outputting position sizes by optimizing the Sharpe ratio of the entire portfolio during training. Similarly, E2EAI presents an end-to-end neural network model that spans the entire quantitative research process, from factor selection and combination to stock selection and portfolio construction. Both approaches bypass traditional factor mining and alpha prediction steps, directly outputting optimal positions and enabling traders to compute the difference between new and old positions to determine subsequent orders. Another significant contribution is DeepLOB [34], which constructs a large-scale deep learning model to predict price movements directly from limit order book (LOB) data of cash equities. Notably, the authors emphasize that DeepLOB generalizes well to instruments not included in the training set, demonstrating the model's ability to extract universal features. Unlike the straightforward end-to-end modeling in [34] and [35], the work in [36] proposes an upstream pretraining framework to extract alphas from order flow data, applicable across various granularities and scenarios. This approach also inspires the large investment model proposed in this paper.\nCompared to traditional quant research pipeline, end-to-end modeling offers several advantages: 1) in traditional quantitative research, the optimization goals of individual modules are usually inconsistent. For instance, each factor is evaluated and selected based on criteria that primarily concern the factor itself, rather than its interaction with other factors. As a result, a \"good\" factor with a high information coefficient (IC) [37] or Sharpe ratio [38] may negatively impact an alpha model due to complex interactions with other factors, while a \"bad\" factor might significantly contribute to the model. 2) The formulaic nature and operator space of factors can limit their representational capability. Almost all operators (e.g., rank(\u00b7), ts_max(\u00b7), etc.) that define formulaic factors are simple algebraic functions, and the representational power of their combinations is difficult to compare with deep neural networks. Therefore, with sufficient sample size, end-to-end modeling has a higher ceiling than traditional multi-factor modeling. 3) Factor mining is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, especially for building and selecting factors by hand. On the other hand, end-to-end modeling throws these \"dirty work\" to deep learning algorithms and may reduce the cost significantly.\nCompared to the traditional quantitative research pipeline, end-to-end modeling presents several significant advantages. First, in the traditional approach, the optimization goals of individual modules often lack consistency. For instance, factors are typically evaluated and selected based on criteria that focus primarily on the factor itself, rather than on its interaction with other factors. This can lead to situations where a \"good\" factor, characterized by a high information coefficient (IC) [37] or Sharpe ratio [38], may inadvertently have a detrimental effect on an alpha model due to complex interactions with other factors. Conversely, a \"bad\" factor could unexpectedly enhance model performance. Second, the formulaic nature and operator space of traditional factors limit their representational capacity. Most operators (e.g., rank(\u00b7), ts_max(\u00b7)) that define formulaic factors are simple algebraic functions. The representational power of these combinations is difficult to compare with that of deep neural networks. Thus, with a sufficiently large sample size, end-to-end modeling has a higher potential for performance than traditional multi-factor modeling. Third, factor mining is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, particularly when factors are manually constructed and selected. In contrast, end-to-end modeling delegates these \"dirty tasks\" to deep learning algorithms, potentially reducing the overall cost and effort significantly."}, {"title": "3.2. Universal Modeling for LIM", "content": "The universality of LIM should encompass at least the following three aspects:\n1. Cross-instrument universality. Given quote data, can a machine-mined pattern for predicting stock trends be applied to predict trends in futures or bonds? Logically, many trading patterns reflect traders' intentions and behaviors, and it is natural for some common patterns to be shared across various instruments. Empirically, many technical or price/volume factors are useful not only for stock prediction but also for bonds, futures, and even cryptocurrencies. This suggests the feasibility of training a general-purpose upstream model with data from various instruments and fine-tuning this model with specific data for each instrument.\n2. Cross-exchange universality. Stock trading across different exchanges may exhibit common patterns or signals, especially for technical indicators or strategies based on quote data (and sometimes news data). This observation motivates the development of a \"universal\u201d model using data from multiple exchanges, which can then be applied to trade equities in specific markets. Similarly, many other instruments (e.g., futures, bonds) share cross-exchange patterns, making them suitable for pretraining the foundational quant model.\n3. Cross-frequency universality. Patterns often persist across different data frequencies, such as 1-second, 15-second, 1-minute, 20-minute, 1-hour, and daily candlesticks. Training on data from the same instrument across various frequencies can significantly enhance the sample size, which is crucial for improving the performance of deep learning models."}, {"title": "4. Upstream Foundation Model", "content": "As illustrated in Figure 6, the upstream modeling focuses on developing a universal foundation model for quantitative investment. The goal of the upstream pretraining foundation model is to be as general as possible, enabling it to address a broad spectrum of financial time-series prediction problems."}, {"title": "4.1. Problem Formulation", "content": "We formulate the foundation model in the upstream pre-training stage as follows. Suppose we have a dataset of M multivariate time series $D = \\{X^{(m)}\\}_{m=1}^{M}$, where each multivariate time series $X^{(m)} \\in [R^{T^{(m)} \\times p}$ has a length $T^{(m)}$ and dimension p. For each time point t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 T), we define two sliding windows: a look-back context window of length $L_x$ that defines the input $X_{t-L_x+1:t}$, and a look-forward horizon window of length $L_y$ that defines the output $X_{t+1:t+L_y}$. The foundation model is a function $f: R^{L_x \\times p} \\to R^{L_y \\times p}$. Given parameters $\\Theta$, we aim to satisfy the relationship $X_{t+1:t+L_y} \\approx f(X_{t-L_x+1:t} | \\Theta)$.\nTo estimate the mapping function f, various deep learning models can be utilized by minimizing the loss function:\n\n$\\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\sum_{t=1}^{T^{(m)}} L(X_{t+1:t+L_y}, f(X_{t-L_x+1:t} | \\Theta))$\\qquad(2)"}, {"title": "4.2. Modeling Principle", "content": "To build a foundation model for quantitative investment, several conditions must be carefully considered:\n1. Single-instrument time series: To accommodate a wide range of trading strategies and investment scenarios, the upstream model should focus on single financial instrument time series (note that the time series may be multivariate for a single financial instrument). Modeling involving multiple financial instruments (e.g., cross-sectional stock selection for the S&P 500) should be reserved for downstream tasks.\n2. Trading cost and rules: Significant differences in trading rules and transaction costs across exchanges exist. For example, some stock exchanges operate on a T+1 trading basis, where stocks bought today cannot be sold before the next trading day, while others use a T+0 system, allowing for same-day trading. These differences affect the timing of cash flows, market patterns, and overall strategy design and execution. Since the LIM foundation model is expected to learn common market patterns, these differences across exchanges are ignored, treating the problem as a pure time-series prediction task.\n3. Patching and masking: A time-series patch serves as an analogue to a token in language models, and patching has been shown to improve performance. This approach also enhances inference speed by reducing the number of tokens fed into the transformer by a factor equivalent to the patch length. Additionally, employing a random masking strategy can induce adaptive window lengths, allowing the model to experience all possible context lengths, ranging from 1 to the maximum context length, ensuring robust performance across various context lengths.\n4. Data choice: Financial data for investment can be broadly categorized as quote data, fundamental data, and alternative data. Among these, quote data at various frequencies are used to pre-train the foundation model because they are regularly sampled and can be collected across different exchanges. Fundamental and alternative data are used in downstream tasks to build strategy models."}, {"title": "4.3. Design of Foundation Model", "content": "Figure 6 illustrates the construction of an upstream foundation model for LIM. This model is designed to predict future tokens within a Y-window (horizon) based on data from an X-window (context) that covers a fixed historical period. The X-window data are fed into the modeling module, serving as the input for the backbone deep learning model. This model is trained on financial quote time-series data, incorporating various variables (meta-features) such as closing price, bid-ask imbalance, returns, and trading volume, with the aim of predicting the same set of variables within the Y-window. To enhance computational efficiency, time-series segmentation techniques such as patching [43] are applied within the windows. Additionally, patch masking strategies [44] are employed to improve the quality of self-supervised learning and increase the flexibility of window length during model training.\nAn example architecture of the deep neural network is illustrated in Figure 6. For each variable in the time series, the input data from the X-window are first transformed into input patch vectors via an input projection, which then generates patch embedding vectors. These embeddings are concatenated with a time encoding vector to capture temporal information and a feature encoding vector to identify the specific variable being used. After processing through a deep neural network (e.g., a Transformer), the model outputs patches corresponding to each variable. These outputs are then merged and converted back to the original time-series granularity through an output projection, ultimately generating predictions for the variables in the Y-window."}, {"title": "5. Downstream Task Model", "content": "The downstream workflow bridges the foundation model from the upstream process with the final strategy development task. Unlike the foundation model, which primarily relies on quote data, downstream modeling can incorporate a wide variety of task-specific data sources, including news, supply chain information, satellite imagery, earnings call transcripts and so on. These diverse data types can be categorized into graph data, textual data, image data, numerical data, audio data, and video data. To effectively utilize these additional inputs, we employ specialized embedding techniques tailored to each data type, enabling the model to integrate and leverage the unique information contained within these varied structures."}, {"title": "5.1. Data Alignment and Standardization", "content": "Handling diverse data types is crucial for developing robust quant models. Fundamental data, such as financial statements, and alternative data, such as social media sentiment and satellite imagery, often exhibit irregularities in their time series. This irregularity poses significant challenges for data preprocessing, necessitating a methodical approach to align data accurately with corresponding time points and financial instruments.\nProper alignment is essential to ensure that the input data used for model training and evaluation is coherent, consistent, and reflective of true market conditions. First, a fundamental step in data preprocessing is temporal alignment. Since fundamental and alternative data points do not always coincide with regular intervals, it's necessary to synchronize these data points to a common timeline that matches the trading dates or specific events relevant to the investment strategy. Techniques such as interpolation or nearest-neighbor methods can be employed to estimate missing values and align the data with the appropriate time stamps. This alignment ensures that the models receive continuous and accurate inputs, thereby enhancing their predictive accuracy and reliability. Second, instrument alignment is equally critical in the preprocessing phase. Given that different financial instruments (e.g., stocks, bonds, derivatives) may have unique characteristics and response patterns to various data inputs, aligning data to the correct instrument is imperative. This involves mapping the fundamental and alternative data to the specific instruments they relate to, ensuring that each data point is correctly attributed. For instance, corporate earnings reports must be matched to the corresponding company's stock, while industry-wide metrics should be appropriately linked to all relevant securities within that industry. This precise mapping enhances the granularity and relevance of the data, allowing for more targeted and effective modeling.\nFurthermore, aligning data across time points and instruments also involves normalization and standardization processes. These processes adjust data to a common scale, which is crucial when combining disparate data sources. Normalization mitigates the impact of outliers and scales differences, while standardization ensures that all data inputs have a consistent distribution, facilitating more efficient training of machine learning models. By incorporating these preprocessing steps, the data fed into AI models becomes more robust, reducing noise and improving the overall quality of the predictions."}, {"title": "5.2. Model Fine-tuning", "content": "Fine-tuning the LIM foundation model, which is initially pre-trained with quote time series, is a critical step in enhancing its applicability to broader quantitative investment strategies. The foundation model, built primarily on historical price data, needs to be adapted to incorporate additional layers of information to better understand market dynamics. By integrating more fundamental and alternative data alongside the quote data, the fine-tuning process enriches the model with a comprehensive dataset, making it more adept at predicting market movements and refining investment strategies. The use of advanced fine-tuning methods and optimization techniques ensures that the model not only retains its foundational strengths but also evolves to meet current market demands. These enhancements enable the development of more accurate, reliable, and sophisticated investment strategies, ultimately contributing to improved performance in quantitative investment.\nThe fine-tuning process involves adding various new data types, including numerical data such as financial ratios and technical indicators, graph data representing relationships between entities (e.g., corporate networks and supply chains), and unstructured data like images, videos, and audio. For instance, satellite imagery can offer insights into industrial activities, while social media sentiment analysis can provide contextual understanding of market sentiments. This diverse data integration allows the model to capture a wider array of market signals and develop more sophisticated strategies.\nAdapting the foundation model to meet current strategy development demands involves employing several common fine-tuning methods appropriate for quantitative investment. Transfer learning [45] is a pivotal technique where the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new, specific dataset, allowing it to retain its learned knowledge while becoming more specialized. Feature-based Transfer Learning [46] adjusts only the last few layers, leveraging the previously learned features, while Fine-tuning Entire Models [47] retrains the entire network to adapt to the new domain. Layer-wise Fine-Tuning [48] is a technique where different layers of the model are fine-tuned at different rates, typically starting from the last layers and progressively fine-tuning earlier layers. Knowledge Distillation [49] is another approach, where a smaller model (student) is fine-tuned using the outputs of a larger pre-trained model (teacher) as soft targets. Parameter-Efficient Tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [50] and Adapter modules [51], introduce a small number of trainable parameters to existing pre-trained models, allowing for efficient fine-tuning with fewer resources. These algorithms are chosen based on the nature of the task, the available data, and computational resources, balancing the need for adaptation with the risk of overfitting."}, {"title": "5.3. Various Types of Downstream Tasks", "content": "Quantitative investment encompasses a broad range of strategy types. Given that the upstream foundation model primarily serves as a predictor for single time-series data, the downstream process becomes crucial for strategies that involve multiple instrument time-series. These include strategies such as cross-sectional stock selection, pairs trading, and various complex arbitrage approaches. Below, we outline several typical strategy scenarios and describe the corresponding downstream processing tasks:\n\u2022 Fundamental Investing. Fundamental investing, which often involves low-frequency trading, relies heavily on fundamental data sources such as analysts' reports, financial statements, news articles, and other alternative data related to company performance and operations. In the downstream process, these data types are combined with the embeddings generated by the pretrained model to fine-tune a new prediction model focused on fundamental analysis. Due to the typically small sample size in low-frequency trading, the downstream model is often limited to predicting the next alpha signal. Subsequently, portfolio positions are optimized using a Markowitz optimizer, and order execution strategies are derived from algorithmic trading techniques.\n\u2022 Statistical Arbitrage. Statistical arbitrage [52] strategies involve trading two or more historically correlated assets based on deviations from their mean or expected relationship. For instance, in pairs trading, when one asset outperforms its counterpart, the strategy may involve selling or shorting the overvalued asset while buying or going long on the undervalued asset, with the expectation that the spread will revert to its historical average. In this context, the upstream foundation model embeds the assets used in pairs trading into latent vectors. These vectors are then processed by the downstream model to predict optimal trading times.\n\u2022 Lead-Lag Strategy. The lead-lag strategy [53] involves trading two assets where one asset (the \"leading\" asset) is anticipated to influence the performance of the other (the \"lagging\" asset). Unlike pairs trading, where assets are traded in opposite directions, the lead-lag strategy involves trading only the lagging asset based on the trend of the leading asset. In this scenario, the downstream model is fine-tuned to take embeddings of both the lead and lag time series as input, and outputs predictions for the lagging series.\n\u2022 Cross-Sectional Strategy. Cross-sectional strategies [54] differ from time-series approaches in that they involve trading a broad universe of assets simultaneously based on predicted alphas for the same time horizon. Common cross-sectional strategies include stock selection and long-short hedging. During the downstream process, the entire cross-section of assets is input into the fine-tuning model as a single sample. Multiple cross-sectional samples from different time points are used to train the downstream model, ultimately guiding the selection of stocks for buy/sell or long/short trades based on the predicted horizons."}, {"title": "6.

Computing and Data Infrastructure", "content": "Building large-scale investment models requires the integration of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms to manage the complexity and volume of data. These platforms facilitate efficient training and execution of models, ensuring scalability to accommodate growing data volumes and computational demands [55]. The architecture of HPC systems can be specially optimized for financial time-series modeling, enhancing the performance of deep learning models applied to these data types.\nAn effective and reliable data system is crucial for deploying large investment models. This system must support a variety of database types to meet different data storage and retrieval needs:\n\u2022 SQL databases manage relational data such as candlestick data, financial statement records, and transaction data, ensuring robust data integrity and complex query capabilities [56].\n\u2022 Graph databases are excellent for handling data with complex relationships and interconnections, useful for analyzing supply chain networks and stock relationships [57].\n\u2022 NoSQL databases are suited for unstructured and semi-structured data, like social media feeds and news articles, offering flexibility and scalability [58].\n\u2022 Time-series databases specialize in managing temporal data, crucial for tracking financial market data and economic indicators [59].\n\u2022 Vector databases store high-dimensional embedding vectors that characterize various data representations, managing metadata from diverse alternative data sources.\nTo complement this diverse data system, constructing a high-performance data computation system is essential for accelerating data preprocessing tasks. Utilizing distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark allows for parallel processing of large datasets, significantly reducing the time required for data cleaning, transformation, and integration [60]. In-memory computing technologies like Apache Ignite and Redis enhance processing speeds by storing data in RAM for quick access and manipulation [61]. For real-time trading, stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink provide continuous ingestion and processing of real-time data streams, ensuring timely decision-making for investment models [62].\nBuilding a highly reliable data system supports large-scale investment models by ensuring data integrity, availability, and security. Distributed storage solutions such as the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Amazon S3 offer scalable and fault-tolerant storage, distributing data across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy and high availability [63]. Efficient computing is further achieved through algorithm optimization and advanced hardware, enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster, more accurate predictions. Data robustness is maintained through rigorous validation and cleansing procedures, alongside redundant storage systems to mitigate the risks of data corruption and loss.

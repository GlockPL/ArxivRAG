Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering or concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the model's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce SafetyDPO, a method for safety alignment of T2I models through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We enable the application of DPO for safety purposes in T2I models by synthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which we call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety experts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the generation process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge the experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal scaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing us to remove 7\u00d7 more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines. Safety-DPO consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and establishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly in recent years, becoming key tools in content creation and entertainment, used by both professionals and hobbyists [48, 49]. Such an impressive growth in image synthesis capabilities, in some cases reaching indistinguishable realism from real samples, has generated concerns about the risks of releasing such models [8, 13, 14, 18]. Indeed, T2I may generate unsettling or harmful content, and expose people, particularly minors or those from sensitive cultural backgrounds, to inappropriate outputs. Moreover, malicious users could easily generate, among others, violent pictures, or sexually-explicit deepfakes, potentially causing misinformation or harassing specific users [17, 34]. Regardless of these risks, there has been little effort in proposing effective safety alignment techniques, i.e. strategies for limiting harmful outputs, for T2I models. Most of the current approaches are focused on simple input filtering strategies, such as the analysis of the input prompt, or detectors on output images [2]. However, these strategies are easy to circumvent [46], or they can be deactivated if models are openly released. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) are subject to rigorous safety alignment procedures before be-"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Content filtering Often, closed-source commercial T2I use prompt blacklists, LLM preprocessing, and image analysis for content filtering [1, 3, 4]. In particular, some use LLM-based prompt analysis [36] to detect harmful inputs, even with ad-hoc models [28]. Recently, Latent Guard [33] proposed a latent-based blacklist within text encoders in T2I models. Some works rely instead on the analysis of generated images [2], where an NSFW classifier is applied to generated images. Instead, others [41] use inpainting to mask potentially unsafe content. These approaches can easily be deactivated if the T2I models' weights are available.\nConcept removal in T2I Some have explored removing the capability of generating concepts in T2I, like SLD [52], using classifier-free guidance [23] to steer generation away from undesirable outputs. Similarly, Li et al. [31] identify interpretable directions that can be used for safety steering. Alternatively, many fine-tune the T2I. While seminal works finetune the entire model [30], some focus on specific components, such as attentions [16, 39, 62], specific neurons [9], or the textual encoder [43]. There has been a recent interest in mass removal of concepts from T2I models for safety purposes [16, 35]. While MACE [35] uses a similar strategy as ours, they make use of segmentation masks, constraining the erasable concepts at spatially-defined ones. Moreover, all available approaches [16, 35] degrade performance with more than 100 erased concepts.\nModel merging Model merging, i.e. combining multiple models into one model, has gained attention [11, 61]. Weighted averaging methods are commonly used to enhance performance [19, 27, 57], especially in multi-task learning where only model weights are accessible [29]. Beyond these, advanced techniques have emerged, improving over basic averaging [5, 37, 40]. For example, TIES [58] resolves operator conflicts to improve merging, at the cost of hyperparameter tuning. Merging has been explored for safety in LLMs [7, 20] and for concept removal in MACE [35], but only using expensive optimization procedures. Existing LoRA merging for T2I focus on single subjects [54, 63]. In SafetyDPO, we propose a cheap and effective merging strategy, focusing on broad safety categories."}, {"title": "3.

Let us assume an input pair (x,p) ~ Dtrain sampled from a training dataset Dtrain of images x and paired textual description p. The network e is trained by estimating the ground truth noise et injected on x for a random t \u2208 [0,T]. We define the input image with the addition of noise as xt.

DPO for diffusion models", "content": "DPO is a technique for preference alignment initially developed for LLMs [45] and recently extended to diffusion models [56]. The core idea is to benefit from pairwise preferences obtained by labeling. Let us assume a dataset DDPO of paired images and textual descriptions (x+,x\u00af, p). For a given description p, x+ is a image that humans indicated as preferred output with respect to x\u00af. The intuition of DPO is to increase the likelihood to generate the preferred output x+, while discouraging the generation of x\u00af. This translates into the following loss:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{DPO}(\\epsilon, x^+, x^-, p) = log \\sigma(\\kappa(\\mathcal{L}_{diff}(\\epsilon, x^+, p) \u2013 \\mathcal{L}_{diff}(\\epsilon_{ref}, x^+, p)) -(\\mathcal{L}_{diff}(\\epsilon, x^-, p) \u2013 \\mathcal{L}_{diff}(\\epsilon_{ref}, x^-, p))))$,\nwhere \u20acref is a reference pre-trained network, typically resulting from a previous optimization of Eq. 2.

DPO for safety alignment in T2I", "content": "We aim to use DPO as a strategy to perform safety alignment on pretrained T2I models. Ideally, assuming an unsafe textual input describing a sexually explicit, shocking, or violent scene, we would like the diffusion model to ignore the unsafe requested traits, and generate a safe image, i.e. not including any visually disturbing trait. We aim to achieve this by generating automatically {unsafe, safe} image pairs for DPO training, obtained by propting the T2I with LLM-manipulated text. In a nutshell, we can discourage the generation of unsafe images, having as preferred DPO image a visually-close safe sample, for an unsafe input T2I prompt.\nWe start by generating a dataset of unsafe concepts C with an LLM. Each concept c\u2208 C is a keyword representing unsafe elements that may be included in an image, such as \"homicide\", \u201cnude\u201d, etc. Then, we follow the prompt synthesis procedure of the CoPro dataset [33], generating both unsafe and safe prompts for image generators from concepts, enforcing minimal differences. Specifically, we sample an unsafe prompt pU by prompting an LLM to create text visually describing a scene using the input concept c. Then, we further process the generated pu with an LLM, prompted to remove any reference to the input unsafe concept c and to transform the prompt into a safe ps, while minimizing semantic changes. Differently from [33], we process both prompts with a pretrained diffusion model,"}, {"title": "4.2. Improving scaling with safety experts", "content": "Training with our proposed strategy in Section 4.1 enables us to scale the number of concepts used for safety alignment, while keeping generative capabilities intact. However, by increasing the number of concepts in C, we noticed a decrease in performance. We suppose this is due to the complexity of the task: in safety alignment there is a need of a high contextual understanding of the generated scenes. As an example, an image of a kitchen including knives is a safe output, while a scene of harassment with the usage of a knife is an undesired unsafe outcome of the image synthesis process, that we aim to prevent. As a solution, we propose to decompose the safety alignment on separate categories, such as \u201cviolence\u201d, \u201csexual content\u201d, \u201charassment\u201d, and others. Our intuition is that by limiting the variability of the generated images, it would be easier to identify visual patterns that would make a scene \"violent\u201d, or \"sexually explicit\". Hence, we aim to train safety experts, each focusing on one category only.\""}, {"title": "4.3. Experts merging", "content": "To prevent the generation of content across multiple safety-related categories, additional considerations are necessary. Indeed, loading multiple LoRAs into a model can lead to interference [26], reducing overall performance in safety-oriented image generation. Alternatively, multiple experts could be run independently, at the cost of multiplying inference costs. To mitigate these issues, we aim to merge the trained LoRAs into a single one, as visualized in Figure 3, without sacrificing performance.\nWe propose a novel data-based strategy, called Co-Merge, to merge multiple safety experts, specifically designed around our use case. Our intuition is that by decomposing safety alignment in multiple categories (Section 4.2), trained LoRAs sharing the same architecture would encode information about category-specific alignment in different neurons. In other words, we assume that in the T2I model, the weights responsible for generating violent content (i.e. including, for instance, blood) will be different from those generating sexually-explicit content"}, {"title": "5. Experiments", "content": "We first introduce our setup (Section 5.1), and compare with baselines in Section 5.2. We then analyze the properties of SafetyDPO (Section 5.3) and show ablations (Section 5.4)."}, {"title": "5.1. Experimental Setup", "content": "Baselines. We use SafetyDPO to align two models for T2I, namely Stable Diffusion v1.5 (SD v1.5) [48] and SDXL [42]. For both, we compare the original versions released on HuggingFace, and our finetuned version with SafetyDPO. Moreover, we compare with recent methods based on SD v1.5 for safe image generation (SLD [51]) and concept erasure (ESD [15], UCE [16]). In particular, for ESD, we follow the paper indications and and use ESD-u [15], a version of ESD for broad concept removal. We perform our analysis on SafetyDPO properties and ablations on SD v1.5.\nMetrics. To evaluate the effectiveness of safety alignment, we use the inappropriate probability metric (IP) from SLD [51], measuring the ratio of unsafe contents generated by T2I with unsafe prompts. The unsafe content detection is performed by using classification results of Q16 [50] and NudeNet [47]. For evaluating image quality, we use FID [22], and CLIPScore [21] for text-image alignment.\nDatasets. For training of SafetyDPO, we generate a new dataset following Section 4.1, named CoProV2 (Concepts and Prompts). We motivate this choice by observing a limitation in the CoPro dataset [33], i.e. the limited IP measured on images generated with the prompts of the dataset. This suggests that many prompts in CoPro are not leading to unsafe generations. This is due to to the limited performance of the LLM building CoPro. We start from the same C as CoPro: 723 harmful concepts across 7 categories (Hate, Harassment, Violence, Self-Harm, Sexual, Shocking, Illegal). We re-generate the unsafe/safe prompts pairs with a new LLM prompt reported in supplementary. We use Mistral-Nemo-Instruct [38] for the prompt synthesis. We generate 23,690 pairs of safe/unsafe prompts, and we use 15,690/8,000 pairs for training/ testing. For testing only, we use I2P [6] and Unsafe Diffusion (UD) [44],"}, {"title": "5.2. Benchmarks", "content": "Quantitative evaluation. In Table 2, we show the comparison results with the baselines for IP, FID, and CLIP-Score across both backbones. For fairness, all baselines were re-trained on the CoProV2 training set and evaluated using the CoProV2 test set, I2P, and UD. Note that I2P and UD serve as out-of-distribution evaluations, differing in prompt format and content from CoProV2. Initially, we adapted the baselines using the complete C set of CoProV2 with Stable Diffusion v1.5 as the backbone. This involved using C to identify negative embeddings in SLD and excluding all C concepts for ESD-u and UCE. All baselines collapsed due to the high number of concepts in CoProV2, aligning with the limited scaling performance noted in previous works [15, 16]. These results are included in the supplementary material. For successful training comparisons, we used the 7 category names of CoProV2 as removable concepts for the baselines, while we use the full prompts and images in CoProV2 for SafetyDPO. We trained our expert LoRAs on samples generated with all C, one per category, and merge them with Co-Merge. As shown in the table, we outperform considerably all baselines in every metric. Notably, our IP for SD v1.5 on CoProV2 (0.07) is much lower than the next best (ESD-u, 0.22). Additionally, SafetyDPO demonstrates superior generalization, achieving better IP scores on unseen I2P (0.08) and UD (0.16). Our DPO-based strategy effectively maintains Stable Diffusion's generation capabilities preventing forgetting of concepts unrelated to safety. Indeed we report nearing the performance of the Baseline method without safety alignment in FID (70.96 vs 69.77) and CLIPScore (32.32 vs 33.52) on COCO captions. We also applied SafetyDPO to SDXL to test the generalization of our method to a different diffusion model. Our results are consistent with a different backbone, achieving performance comparable to our adapted SD v1.5 with IP 0.09 on CoProV2. This suggests that SafetyDPO can be used for the safety alignment of arbitrary T2I models."}, {"title": "5.3. Properties", "content": "Experts performance For SafetyDPO, we train an expert for each category in CoProV2. We now examine the effectiveness of each expert LoRA across all categories in the CoProV2 test set in Table 3. The results show that training and evaluating on the same category generally leads to good performance, as expected. Interestingly though, applying one expert LoRA consistently improves IP across all categories and often surpasses the expert trained specifically for that category. We attribute this to the interaction of multiple concepts across categories. While the concepts differ, the visual features of generated images may share similarities. For example, scenes in the \"Violence\" or \"Self-harm\" categories often depict blood, while the \"Hate\" category may include sexual slurs, which could explain the strong performance on \"Sexual\" data. Ultimately, this suggests that for safety alignment tasks, SafetyDPO is robust to the concept selection. However, experts trained on different categories still encode distinct concepts. This becomes evident when merging all LoRAs with Co-Merge (All - Ours), since we achieve the best performance across all categories. We also include a baseline where a single LoRA is trained on prompts from all categories (All - single), which shows suboptimal performance. Here, the lack of specialized expert models results in less effective training, justifying our design.\nAdversarial attacks robustness To understand if harmful concepts are effectively removed from the T2I model capabilities, we perform an additional experiment based on text-based adversarial attacks. Those allow to optimize text apparently innocuous, but leading to unsafe generation. If"}, {"title": "5.4.

As visible from the reported results, training in the same setup as SafetyDPO (i.e. with concepts) results in a collapse of the majority of baselines. Let us highlight that lower IP values (e.g. in ESD-u) does not necessarily mean that performance are better. Indeed, a lower IP may be associated to a collapse of the network, that losing all generative capabilities, it also loses the possibility to generate safe contents. This is quantified by the significantly degraded values of FID (111.29) and CLIP-Score (19.01). SLD exhibit considerably better stability thanks to its training-free approach. Moreover, we tested with pretrained checkpoints for ESD-u for nudity removal, achieving an IP of 0.48 on CoProV2 and as such significantly worse performance than our retraining-based results.\nK, we.

This is evidence that a few examples are sufficient to drive the selection of neurons inside LoRAs in a robust manner.

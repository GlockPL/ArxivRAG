However, it is a very challenging problem due to the entanglement of human and camera motion.\nThere are only a few works [41,81,99,100] that try to address this problem. Earlier methods [47,100] only focus on human motion and ignore the camera motion. Their core insight is that the global body motion is highly correlated with the local motion. Thus, they can use the local body movements to estimate the global orientation and trajectory with a regression model [100] or by combining them with physics constraints [47]. However, these regression models ignore the camera movements, so they fail to maintain consistency with the input video, whereas physics-based methods fail to model complex in-the-wild environments so are limited to controlled scenarios. Recent works [41,99] try to jointly estimate the human and camera motion by exploiting learned motion priors [21,76] and SLAM [66, 89, 90]. They try to constrain the human body motion in a low-dimensional latent space of a motion prior model, which results in reconstructed motions that are overly smooth and do not align well with video observations. Moreover, the optimization of the camera motion is only based on the global human motion from the motion prior. Hence, they fail catastrophically if the initial human motion predictions are significantly incorrect (as shown in Fig. 1).\nMore recently, Denoising Diffusion Models [24,91] have emerged as a powerful family of generative models that can model high-quality data priors. Nonetheless, effectively leveraging the learned priors remains an ongoing challenge. Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is commonly employed for this purpose [74], but we find that naive application of SDS also results in inconsistencies with the available observations (see Sec. 4.2). The root cause of this problem lies in the inconsistency of randomly sampled motions during SDS optimization. Without constraints, these motions may not align with observed evidence, leading to overly smoothed results that lack detail due to the mode-averaging effect.\nIn this work, we propose COIN, a hybrid COntrol-INpainting score distillation sampling method to address the aforementioned limitations of vanilla SDS. First, we use the partially observed human motion from the video as control signals to guide motion sampling. To tackle noisy observations which may be out of distribution for the prior, we propose a dynamic controlled sampling technique that iteratively refines the observed motions and updates the control signals to ensure effective distillation from the motion prior. Second, to further improve the consistency of the sampled motions, we also develop a novel soft inpainting strategy. We automatically identify the high-confidence regions of the initial predicted global motion from the video and use them as soft constraints during optimization. Concretely, we sample less confident regions from scratch using the"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Camera-Space Human Pose Estimation. Most existing works focus on root-relative local human pose estimation to bypass the difficulty in monocular depth estimation [1, 4, 6\u20138, 16, 32\u201334, 39, 42\u201346, 51, 54, 63, 64, 67, 68, 70, 76, 78, 84, 85, 88, 94, 97, 106, 110, 116, 119]. These methods ignore the position of the person in the camera coordinates. To overcome this limitation, recent methods estimate camera-space human poses by regression [28, 31, 48, 52, 62, 72, 75, 80, 93, 95, 107, 107, 109, 111] or optimization [59\u201361, 77, 108]. Physics-based constraints are widely used to ensure the plausibility of the estimated poses [10, 13, 27, 29, 80, 95, 105]. In addition to direct regression, heatmap-based representations have also been used to predict the absolute depths of multiple people [11, 87, 118]. A few methods improve absolution depth estimation by using predicted camera parameters [40, 49, 109] instead of the predefined focal length. Despite the promising results\nfor camera-space pose estimation, how to decouple the camera movement and estimate global human motions is still an open problem.\nMonocular Global Human Pose Estimation. Recovering the global human motion from a monocular moving camera is challenging due to the entanglement of human and camera motions. To disentangle the camera movement, several methods use IMU sensors or pre-scanned environments to recover global human motions [17,20,57,69], which is impractical for large-scale adoption. Recent works use human motion priors [100] or physics-based constraints [47,55] to recover human motions from monocular videos, but do not consider background scene features, which limits performance on in-the-wild videos. Sun et al. [86] use optical flow as a motion cue to estimate the global motions. A contemporary work, WHAM [81], uses a lifting network to estimate global human motions from 2D keypoints and camera angular velocities. While these works can estimate accurate global human motions, they do not recover camera motions. To explicitly recover the camera motion, Liu et al. [52] use SLAM and convert the local pose from the camera to global coordinates. BodySLAM [22] jointly optimizes the human and camera motion using features of both humans and scenes. Along this line, SLAHMR [99] and PACE [41] use SLAM to initialize camera motions and optimize the camera using human motion priors [21,76]. However, these methods rely on the human motion priors to regularize the camera motion, which may lead to inaccurate camera motion when the human motion is not well initialized (as shown in Fig. 1). Such wrong camera trajectories will further affect the optimization of human motions. In contrast, our approach relies on the consistency among the local human motion, scene features, and the camera for optimization, which provides information that complements the human motion priors and enables accurate estimation of both human and camera motions.\nHuman Motion Priors. There are a significant amount of approaches proposed to study 3D human dynamics for motion prediction and synthesis [2, 3, 5, 12, 15, 18, 19, 23, 30, 36, 38, 50, 58, 71, 73, 92, 98, 101\u2013103]. These learned human motion priors are used to help resolve pose ambiguity [21,39,76,115] in human pose estimation. Recently, diffusion models [82] have also been used as priors for motion synthesis and infilling [26, 35, 91, 104, 113]. RoHM [114], adopts motion diffusion model to recover human motions from noisy and occluded input data. Xie et al. [96] use spatial control signals to guide motion generation. They focus on generating realistic human motion given clean spatial constraints. M\u00fcller et al. [65] build a diffusion model to learn the joint distribution over the poses of two people. They use the SDS loss to guide the generation of static poses. In contrast, we focus on dynamic human motions. We find adopting SDS directly for temporal human motions encounters the inconsistency issue. Therefore, to distill knowledge from the motion diffusion model, we propose a novel control-inpainting SDS to generate high-quality and consistent motion that aligns with observed evidence."}, {"title": "Method", "content": "The overall framework of COIN is illustrated in Fig. 2. Given an in-the-wild RGB video with T frames captured by a dynamic camera, our goal is to estimate both the global human motion \\(H = \\{h^{(1)}, h^{(2)}, ..., h^{(T)}\\}\\) and the camera motion \\(C = \\{c^{(1)}, c^{(2)}, ..., c^{(T)}\\}\\) in a global world coordinate system. We use off-the-shelf 3D human pose and shape estimation method HybrIK [48] to obtain per-frame initial SMPL parameters in the camera space and DROID-SLAM [89] to obtain the initial per-frame camera-to-world transforms. We convert the local human motion to the world coordinates with the estimated camera. However, because the camera trajectories from SLAM are up to an unknown scale, the initial global human motion will abnormally drift and float in the world space. To resolve the scale ambiguity and place the person in the correct global position, we jointly optimize the human and camera motion to minimize the discrepancy between the observed evidence and the estimated motion, while maintaining the plausibility of the human motion with a diffusion prior through the proposed control-inpainting SDS.\nMotion Representation. The camera motion is represented by the trajectory \\(C = \\{(R^{(i)}, t^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^{T}\\), where \\([R^{(i)}, t^{(i)}]\\) is the camera pose at the i-th frame, consisting of the rotation matrix \\(R^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times 3}\\) and the translation vector \\(t^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}\\). The human motion is represented by the human trajectory \\(H = \\{h^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{T}\\),"}, {"title": "Revisiting SDS", "content": "Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) was first introduced to distill 3D assets from pre-trained 2D text-to-image diffusion models [74]. It exploits the knowledge from the diffusion models by seeking modes for the conditional distribution in the DDPM latent space to optimize the 3D scene representation. Similarly, we can optimize global human motion by distilling knowledge from a pre-trained motion diffusion model.\nGiven an global human motion H, the marginal distribution of noisy latent \\(H_t\\) at timestep \\(t \\in U(0, 1)\\) is defined as:\n\\[q(H_t|H) = N(H_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}H, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t)I),\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{\\alpha}_t \\in (0, 1)\\) is a hyperparameter controlled by the variance schedule of the diffusion model. SDS adopts the pre-trained diffusion model \\(D_{\\theta}(H_t, t, y)\\), which takes in \\(H_t\\) and is used to model the conditional density of the human motion, where \\(\\theta\\) are the parameters of the diffusion model and y is the condition. Then, SDS aims to distill global human motion H via seeking modes of the learned conditional density, which can be achieved by a weighted denoising score matching objective:\n\\[\\min_H L_{SDS} := E_{t, \\epsilon} [w(t)||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\theta}||^2],\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}\\) is the predicted denoising direction from the diffusion model, \\(H_t \\sim q(H_t|H)\\) is sampled using the reparameterization trick, \\(\\epsilon\\) is the corresponding sampled noise, and \\(w(t)\\) is a weighting function that depends on the timestep t. To clearly review the effect of SDS, we can reparameterize Eq. 2 as:\n\\[\\min_H L_{SDS} := E_t [\\frac{w(t)\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}} || H - H_{\\theta} ||^2],\\]\nwhere\n\\[H_{\\theta} = \\frac{H_t - \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\epsilon_{\\theta}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}}.\\]\nBased on this reparameterization, we can see that the SDS objective is to minimize the discrepancy between global human motion H and the denoised global human motion \\(H_{\\theta}\\) from the motion diffusion model in a single step. The denoised"}, {"title": "Control-Inpainting SDS", "content": "motion \\(H_{\\theta}\\) serves as the pseudo ground truth. However, at each optimization step, we randomly sample t and \\(\\epsilon\\) to generate the noisy latent \\(H_t\\), and we found the pre-trained diffusion model is sensitive to the input. Minor fluctuations in the input latent would substantially change the denoised motion, which leads to inconsistency in H across different time steps.\nAlthough randomness can help generate diverse plausible motions to infer occluded regions and unknown information, we do not need it for well-observed regions, such as simple body poses in a clean background. Such randomness in the denoising steps makes the generated \\(H_{\\theta}\\) difficult to align with the local 2D observations and results in wrong global human motion. Moreover, this pseudo ground truth \\(H_{\\theta}\\) is generated from only a single denoising step, where the diffusion models may not produce high-quality motions, resulting in foot sliding and floating. Although sampling with a smaller timestep t can alleviate these issues, the initial motion is usually inaccurate and the denoiser is not able to remove artifacts with a small t. To exploit the knowledge of the motion diffusion model and denoise the initial motion, we must allow the SDS to sample with a larger timestep t while maintaining high quality, consistency, and alignment with the local 2D observations.\nThe limitations of SDS originate from the randomness and inconsistency of the denoised motion \\(H_{\\theta}\\), which serves as the pseudo ground truth in the objective function. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Control-INpainting SDS (COIN-SDS) to generate high-quality and consistent pseudo-ground-truth motions. Our solution has three key ingredients (shown in Alg. 1). First, to achieve high-quality motions, we seek to produce the pseudo ground truth with multiple DDIM denoising steps. Second, to encourage consistent motions, we propose to use partially observed evidence from the video as a control signal to dynamically guide the diffusion model and align the generated motions with the observations. Third, to further align the motion with observed regions, we propose a soft inpainting strategy within the denoising process.\nMultiple Denoising Steps. Intuitively, to obtain high-quality pseudo ground truth for SDS, we can replace the single-step denoised motion \\(H_{\\theta}\\) with a multi-step one \\(H_0 := H_{\\theta}\\), following the multi-step DDIM denoising process [83]:\n\\[H_{t-\\Delta t} = \\sqrt{\\alpha_{t-\\Delta t}} \\frac{H_t}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} + \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha_{t-\\Delta t}} \\epsilon^*,\\]\nuntil \\(\\hat{H}_0 = H_{t-\\Delta t}\\) is obtained. By replacing \\(H_{\\theta}\\) in Eq. 3 with \\(\\hat{H}_0\\), we can obtain a new objective for SDS:\n\\[\\min_H L_{SDS} := E_t [\\frac{w(t) \\sqrt{\\alpha_t}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\alpha_t}} || H - \\hat{H}_0 ||^2],\\]\nAlthough the multi-step denoising process can produce high-quality pseudo ground truth, it is computationally expensive to perform multiple denoising steps during"}, {"title": "Global Optimization", "content": "Here we present the overall optimization pipeline for the joint estimation of global human and camera motion with the proposed COIN-SDS loss. Note that we use SLAM to initialize the camera poses, which is scale-ambiguous. Therefore,\nwe need to jointly optimize the camera scale s with the human and camera motions. Furthermore, the SLAM method assumes the camera in the first frame to be at the origin. To put the human motion in the correct positions, we follow PACE [41] and also optimize the camera height \\(h_0\\) and the orientation \\(R_0\\) for the first frame. The global human motions are initialized by the estimated local motions and the camera poses. The overall optimization objective is:\n\\[\\min_{H,C,s,h_0, R_0, \\beta} L_{body} + L_{COIN-SDS} + L_{HSR},\\]\nwhere\n\\[L_{body} = L_{2D} + L_{3D} + L_{\\beta} + L_{smooth} + L_{contact}.\\]\n\\(L_{2D}\\) measures the 2D reprojection error between the projected 2D body joints of the estimated human motion and the detected 2D keypoints from an off-the-shelf 2D joint detector [9]. \\(L_{3D}\\) measures the distance between the estimated local 3D joints and the detected 3D joints from an off-the-shelf 3D joint detector [79]. \\(L_{\\beta}\\) is the shape regularization loss. \\(L_{smooth}\\) is the temporal smoothness loss. \\(L_{contact}\\) is the foot contact loss to encourage zero velocities for contact joints. The contact labels are obtained from the pseudo ground truth motion from COIN-SDS. Please refer to the appendix for more details.\nHuman-scene Relation Loss. The camera trajectories recovered from SLAM are scale-ambiguous. Previous works [41,99] optimize the camera scale by projecting the global human motion to the camera space using the camera poses and minimizing the reprojection error. However, such a method entirely relies on the global human motions, which is in turn affected by the camera scale. If the human motion is not initialized well, the camera scale will also be inaccurate. To solve this problem, instead of the global human motions, we propose a new human-scene relation loss that uses the depth relation between the human and scene in the camera space, which disentangles the effect of the camera itself.\nSpecifically, we use the point cloud of the scene recovered by SLAM as a constraint. First of all, the scale of the scene point cloud is the same as the camera scale, so optimizing the scene scale is equivalent to optimizing the camera scale. Second, the scene points that are projected onto the visible vertices of the body mesh should be occluded by the person. Otherwise, the corresponding body parts are invisible. Therefore, we can constrain the depth of the occluded scene points to be larger than the depth of the human body vertices. While finding the corresponding body vertices for each scene point is time-consuming, we propose to use the depth of its nearest body joint as a proxy. Given the scene point cloud P and the camera scale s, the human-scene relation loss is formulated as:\n\\[L_{HSR} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{i=1}^{T} \\sum_{p \\in P^*} \\min(0, T^{(i)}(p)_z - j^{(i)}(p)_z) \\cdot 1(T^{(i)}(p) \\text{ is invisible}),\\]\nwhere \\(P^* = P * s\\) is the scaled point cloud of the scene, \\(T^{(i)}(p) = R^{(i)}p + t^{(i)}\\) is the transformed point in the i-th frame, \\(j^{(i)}(p)\\) is body joint that has the nearest"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Datasets. We perform experiments on three human motion datasets. First is the real-world dataset RICH [25]. We follow previous works [41,81,100] to assess the performance of global human motion estimation using this dataset. The second one is EMDB [37]. We follow previous works [81] to evaluate on a subset of EMDB for which they provide ground truth global motion with dynamic cameras. The third dataset is HCM [41], a synthetic dataset. Compared to real-world datasets, HCM contains more challenging camera motions. We follow previous work [41] to evaluate the global human motion and the camera motion using this dataset.\nMetrics. We report various metrics for both human and camera motion. For human motion, standard metrics W-MPJPE and WA-MPJPE are used to evaluate global motion, while PA-MPJPE evaluates local motion. We also include an ACCEL metric to measure the joint acceleration error. For evaluation on EMDB, we follow previous work [81] to split sequences into smaller chunks of 100 frames and align each output segment with the ground-truth data using the first two frames W-MPJPE100 or the entire segment WA-MPJPE100. Root Orientation Error (ROE in deg) and Root Translation Error (RTE in m) evaluate the error over the entire trajectory after aligning with the initial camera pose.\nFor camera motion, we report the average translation error after scale alignment (ATE), without scale alignment (ATE-S), and the camera acceleration error (CAM ACCEL). ATE-S more accurately reflects inaccuracies in the captured scale of the camera.\nBaselines. As discussed in Sec. 2, there are different ways to use the pre-trained motion diffusion model as a motion prior. Here, we summarize the three main solutions and compare them with COIN in Sec. 4.2. (1) Guided Sampling, which embeds analytical guidance within the denoising procedure using objective functions, such as 2D projection and foot contact consistency. This does not suit our task because the camera trajectories are also unknown and guided gradients from the wrong camera will lead to unrealistic human motions. We need to optimize the human motion and camera motion simultaneously. (2) Noise Optimization, which represents the motion as latent noise and directly optimizes it. This is similar to other motion priors such as VAE [21]. At each optimization step, we need to calculate the gradients of the latent w.r.t. the generated motion, which is computationally expensive and we find the performance is not good enough. (3) Vanilla SDS, which removes our design and directly uses SDS for optimization."}, {"title": "Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods", "content": "Human Motion Estimation.

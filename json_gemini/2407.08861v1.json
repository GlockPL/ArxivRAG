Our approach uses the unique capabilities of SNNs, such as event-based computation and temporal processing, along with the strong representation learning abilities of CNNs, to generate high-quality inpainted images. The model is trained on a custom dataset specifically designed for image inpainting, where missing regions are created using masks. The hybrid model consists of SNNConv2d layers and traditional CNN layers. The SNNConv2d layers implement the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model, capturing spiking behavior, while the CNN layers capture spatial features. In this study, a mean squared error (MSE) loss function demonstrates the training process, where a training loss value of 0.015, indicates accurate performance on the training set and the model achieved a validation loss value as low as 0.0017 on the testing set.

However, CNN-based approaches often struggle to capture temporal dynamics and complex spatial dependencies [1]. To address these limitations, this research study proposes a novel stand-alone hybrid approach that combines the capabilities of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and CNNs for image inpainting. SNNs are a third generation of neural networks inspired by the behavior of spiking neurons in the brain. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, which rely on continuous-valued activations, SNNs capture temporal information by representing neural activity as discrete spikes over time [2]. This allows SNNs to encode and process information in a more biologically realistic manner. By simulating the behavior of spiking neurons, SNNs have the potential to capture complex temporal patterns information through the dynamics of neural spikes in image data [3]. On the other hand, CNNs are powerful deep-learning models commonly used for image-processing tasks and well-known for their ability to extract meaningful features from images through convolutional layers [4]. These layers apply filters or kernels to the input image, capturing spatial patterns and local dependencies. This process is particularly effective in capturing spatial dependencies and extracting meaningful features from images.\nIn the proposed architecture, the SNN model is utilized to capture the temporal dynamics and contextual information in the image, while the capabilities of CNNs are used for feature extraction processing to inpaint the missing or corrupted regions. The proposed model introduced SNNConv2d layers to incorporate the principles of spiking neurons into the convolutional layers. By utilizing SNNConv2d layers, the model is able to capture not only spatial information but also temporal dynamics and contextual information from the input image. This temporal information is then combined with the spatial features extracted by the traditional CNN layers. The integration of both types of layers allows the model to benefit from the strengths of both SNNs and CNNs. Therefore, the SNNConv2d layers modify the behavior of traditional convolutional layers by introducing spike-based computations. Instead of using basic activation functions, such as ReLU or sigmoid. The SNNConv2d layers used spike-based activation functions that generate spikes in response to certain stimuli. These spikes represent the activation of neurons and encode temporal information. Therefore, by combining the strengths of SNNs and CNNs, the hybrid model can produce more accurate and visually high-quality results, making it a promising approach for advancing ML models."}, {"title": "2 Discussion and Results", "content": "The existing methods often struggle to simultaneously capture intricate temporal dynamics and spatial features when dealing with missing or corrupted regions [5].

The hybrid approach aims to create a more comprehensive and biologically inspired model that can effectively handle complex inpainting tasks. Therefore, The fusion of SNN and CNN architectures enables the model to capture both the local and temporal aspects of visual data, potentially leading to improved performance and more efficient processing in tasks such as image inpainting. Furthermore, The hyperparameters of the proposed architecture include parameters like the learning rate, the batch size, the number of training epochs, the specific architecture configurations and layer settings, the loss function, noise-related parameters that influence data augmentation [12], and hyperparameters in the context of SNNConv2d class based on LIF neural model, the \"membrane potential\", represents a neuron's internal state that accumulates signals, and it plays a critical role in determining when the neuron generates a \"spike\" - an essential occurrence event in spiking neural networks. The \"leak factor\" controls how quickly these potential decays, with lower values maintaining more information, while the \"spike threshold\" signifies the critical potential level for spike generation. Additionally, introducing controlled \"noise\" into the output improves in adapting the neuron's behavior during training, enhancing the model's robustness and adaptability. These hyperparameters collectively define the dynamic and adaptive nature of neurons within the network. This stand-alone SC-NN hybrid approach offers several compelling advantages.\n\u2022 Effective handling of spatial and temporal dependencies: The hybrid approach is capable of capturing both spatial and temporal information in the image. This is crucial for inpainting tasks where the missing or corrupted regions may depend on both the surrounding context and the temporal dynamics of the image.\n\u2022 Synergy between SNNs and CNNs: The integration of SNNs and CNNs in the hybrid model can generate a strong model, using the unique advantages of each model.

This fusion of models facilitates a holistic comprehension of the image content, combining both temporal and spatial aspects to enhance the overall inpainting process.\n\u2022 Potential for improved performance: The hybrid SC-NN approach is not solely focused on achieving better performance compared to CNN-based models. Instead, it aims to explore the potential benefits of combining SNNs and CNNs. But this fusion enables a more comprehensive understanding of the image content, which may lead to enhanced inpainting results. Therefore, the focus is on using the combined strengths of SNNs and CNNs to unlock new possibilities in ML models rather than solely aiming for improved performance compared to CNN-based models.\n\u2022 Biologically inspired and interpretable solution: The SC-NN model incorporates the temporal dynamics of spiking neurons, making it more biologically inspired.

The basic structure of the LIF model using post-neuron activities is shown graphically in Figure 2. It computes the membrane potential, generates spikes when the potential crosses the threshold, resets potential, and produces output. Also, Figure 2(b) demonstrates the equivalent circuit model of the LIF neural model. It describes how a neuron integrates incoming input signals and generates spikes (action potentials) based on a membrane potential threshold. In this model, the membrane potential of a spiking neuron is represented by V(t), which is the electrical potential difference across the neuron's cell membrane [13]. The membrane potential is influenced by incoming input signals and a leakage factor. The implemented LIF model approximates the membrane potential dynamics with the equation 1,\n$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \\frac{I(t)}{C} - \\frac{V(t)}{RC}$                                                              (1)\nwhere $\\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$ represents the rate of change of the membrane potential over time, I(t) represents the input current at time t, R represents the membrane resistance, and C represents the membrane capacitance. This equation is based on the methodology of how the membrane potential changes based on the difference between the input current and the leakage current $\\frac{V(t)}{R}$, divided by the membrane capacitance (C). Therefore, the threshold and spike generation works the same as in computational biology [14]: when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold value, the neuron generates a spike (action potential) and resets its membrane potential to a reset value. The following equation 2 is used for spike generation in the LIF model:\nif V(t) \u2265 Vth, then V(t) \u2190 Vreset (EmitSpike) (2)\nV_th represents the spike threshold and V_reset represents the membrane potential reset value. The implemented version of the LIF model incorporates a leakage factor to simulate the gradual decrease in the membrane potential over time. It represents the loss of charge across the neuron's membrane. The leakage in the LIF model is described in equation 3,\n$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \\frac{-V(t)}{T}$                                                                                                (3)\nHere, 7 represents the time constant of the leakage process. Furthermore, the proposed hybrid model used a custom \"Forward Method\", this method performs the forward pass of the spiking convolutional layer. First, it applies the traditional convolution operation to the input x and then adds random noise to the output by multiplying it with noise (Standard deviation of noise = 0.1) sampled from a normal distribution. Finally, it applies the spiking behavior by calling the Spike method, which converts it into binary spikes (positive or negative values).\nAdditionally, the use of the LIF neural model in the proposed hybrid approach offers several specific advantages:"}, {"title": "Biological Plausibility:", "content": "The use of the LIF neural model in the proposed temporal dynamic approach offers several specific advantages, such as this approach ensures that the neural model closely mirrors biological neuron behavior, enhancing the model's practicality and applicability to neuromorphic computing and neural processing."}, {"title": "Event-Driven Computation:", "content": "The LIF model, which is a fundamental component of the proposed temporal dynamic approach, is inherently event-driven, which means it generates spikes only in response to significant input changes.

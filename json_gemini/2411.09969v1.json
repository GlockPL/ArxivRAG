However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels, and\npersonal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging. To address this challenge, we\ndesigned TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that generates personalized translations of scientific text based on\nindividual user profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an interactive slider that allows\nusers to steer the degree of personalization from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging\nLLMs to generate the translations with given degrees. Through an exploratory study with 15 participants,\nwe investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized translations and how interactive reading features\ninfluenced users' understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred higher\ndegrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual translations, while those who preferred\nlower degrees valued concise translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported\nthe compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of scientific content. Given these\nfindings, we discuss several implications of AI-personalized translation tools in facilitating communication in\ncollaborative contexts.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Science communication refers to the process of \u201ccommunicating complex scientific information\nwith general audiences to improve public awareness, interest, and understanding of science\u201d [17].\nBoth academic and industry professionals strive to make their ideas more accessible. As a result,\nscience communication platforms, such as science blogs [32] and science magazines [70], have\nbeen translating scientific information into more accessible formats for decades. However, a single\nversion of a text often falls short of meeting the diverse needs of a general audience [7]. For\ninstance, a journalist with an interest in quantum physics would have vastly different context and\ncomprehension needs than a college student majoring in physics."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Below, we review prior work covering science communication on digital media platforms and\npersonalization of language content for better science communication."}, {"title": "2.1 Science Communication on Digital Media Platforms", "content": "Science communication takes many forms in modern media for communicating complex scientific\ninformation to general audiences for improving public awareness, interest, and understanding of\nscience [17]. Traditional channels include museums [9], exhibitions [48], and TV series [64], while\nweb-based digital platforms have emerged as a powerful new stream for the broader public. For\nexample, online videos have become an influential source for learning science, especially during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, when many people turned to digital resources for scientific information [12].\nSocial media platforms such as Reddit (e.g., r/science), Twitter (now X), Bluesky, and Mastodon\nhave evolved into vibrant spaces where some scientists actively share their research, promote\ntheir publications, and engage in public discussions [28, 39]. Additionally, science blogs have been\nvaluable channels for science communication, offering tailored narratives of complex scientific\ncontent for general audiences [37]. One of the core benefits of science communication on these\ndigital media is their scalability in reaching broader audiences (e.g., [39, 55]). Recent studies show\nthat more than half of college students actively use blogs as a learning resource [31].\nPrior HCI/CSCW literature has uncovered several key challenges that scientists face in science\ncommunication: engagement, translation, and dissemination [71]. First, scientists rarely participate\nin digital media platforms [76]. This limited engagement may be associated with multiple factors,\nincluding conventional academic culture that has historically put scientists as neutral observers\nrather than active communicators [53, 59], and practical constraints such as time limitations and\nlack of communication training [10]. While recent research shows a gradual shift towards more\nactive public engagement by scientists [13], the extent and impact of this change remain to be fully\nunderstood. Secondly, even for those scientists who engage with digital communication, translating\ncomplex scientific concepts into accessible content for general audiences is challenging [61]. These\nchallenges may be compounded by the varied characteristics of general audiences in digital media\nplatforms, where readers have widely differing backgrounds, levels of scientific literacy, and\npreferences [61, 67, 69]. A single version of scientific content translation would not sufficiently\nserve this wide spectrum of general audiences, yet creating multiple versions tailored to different\nexpertise levels would also be infeasible for individual scientists [14, 25]. Lastly, such translation\nchallenges can lead to broader concerns about dissemination, particularly regarding the potential for\nmiscommunication and misinformation on social media platforms [20]. Scientists may be hesitant\nto engage in digital communication because the dissemination of inaccurate interpretations or\nmisrepresentations of their work could have unwanted consequences for public understanding and\ntheir professional reputation [49, 72]."}, {"title": "2.2 Personalization of Language Content for Better Science Communication", "content": "Prior research has explored various approaches to make complex science texts more accessible\nand comprehensible to broader audiences, from using plain language summaries [8] and language\nconstructs like analogies [41] to using interactive techniques and systems [18, 26]. Across these\nworks, limited explorations have been made in personalization of scientific translations to facilitate\nbetter understanding, which this paper explores.\nPersonalization has been explored across various forms of language content, including news arti-\ncles [1], social media posts [75], and novels [40], to better accommodate individual users' needs and\npreferences. Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of such personalization across sev-\neral domains (e.g., healthcare, journalism) through approaches such as using patients' demographic\nand medical information to tailor content [23], using users' location data to make news content\nrelevant [1], and using analogies to make measurements (e.g., distances, areas) comprehensible to a\nuser's context [42]. For instance, employing familiar objects as an analogy (e.g., 28 lbs is about the\nweight of a microwave) to personalize the unit expressions [35]. In science communication contexts,\npast work has shown AI's potential in large scale translation and dissemination through generating\npersonalized summaries of scientific texts for general audiences [7]. In this paper, we build on these\nideas to explore using LLMs for generating and customizing scientific text explanations using user\nprovided data for analogies.\nWhile relying on users' contextual information (e.g., location) delivers personalized outcomes,\nthese systems typically operate autonomously making personalization decisions without the users'\ndirect input or control. This raises several potential concerns. First, there are privacy issues, as\nthese systems require users to share personal data, often assuming their willingness to do so or\neven collecting such information without notice (implicitly) (e.g., location information based on IP\naddress [50], personal profile based on search engine account [30, 51]). Second, users generally lack\ncontrol over which specific data they share for personalization purposes. Additionally, individual\nusers may have different preferences regarding how much of their profile information should be\nintegrated with the tailored content. To address these issues in user agency and privacy control, we\ndesigned a steerable reading interface that enables users to control the degree of personalization\nwith adjustable sliders as well to edit profile information directly for personalizing the translations\nto their context."}, {"title": "3 TranSlider: Design and Implementation", "content": "We designed and implemented TranSlider (Translate through Slider), an AI-powered tool to help\nindividuals with no scientific backgrounds better understand scientific texts by personalizing them\nto their context using a slider interaction and user profiles."}, {"title": "3.1 Interface Design", "content": "The interface comprised three main components: the translation panel, the history box, and the\nedit profile dialog box (Figure 1).

To improve quality, we applied\nchain-of-thought prompting, guiding the model to reason through its responses. Finally, the model\nwas given the scientific article and asked to produce a two-paragraph translation while avoiding\ntitles, honorifics, or other formalities. The exact prompt template is given in Figure 2.\nWe arrived at this prompt template through iterative experimentation.

In the first session, participants interacted with TranSlider\nthat implicitly personalizes scientific articles based on their user profiles, similar to how web\nbrowsers and social media platforms display personalized content based on collected user metadata\n(e.g., Google Chrome's personalization through Google accounts). The second session introduced\na more full-featured interface where participants have the full autonomy to explicitly edit their\nprofiles to manipulate the direction of personalization.

We deliberately chose these contrasting domains to demonstrate that the utility\nof AI-personalized translations may not be dependent on a particular topic; if participants could\nperceive the value of AI-personalized translations across both more personal (health) and less\npersonal (environmental) topics.\nTo select science articles that the general audience would be interested in, we searched articles\nin the Reddit sub-channel r/science\u00b9.

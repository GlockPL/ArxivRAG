They spread quickly in private and organizational contexts, including education. Yet, research lacks a conceptual framing to describe interaction with such agents in a holistic manner. While focusing on the interaction with a pedagogical agent, i.e., a digital agent capable of natural-language interaction with a learner, we propose a model of learning activity based on activity theory. We use this model and a review of prior research on digital agents in education to analyze how various characteristics of the activity, including features of a pedagogical agent or learner, influence learning outcomes. The analysis leads to identification of IS research directions and guidance for developers of pedagogical agents and digital agents in general.

They are digital systems offering a virtual character that interacts with the user by any combination of visual, symbolic, and natural-language communication [58,167,197]. The virtual character might be explicit, possessing a name and a visual representation, or implicit, emerging through its actions [155,197]. The interaction with a DA imitates interaction with another human, though perhaps limited by available media (e.g., text-based chat vs. speech vs. visual input and output) and abilities of the DA (e.g., guidance vs. accepting and answering predefined input vs. accepting and answering free input). Other terms for DA include virtual agent/assistant or conversational agent. IS research proposed numerous applications in which DA are used to reduce cognitive load, enhance customer experience, or improve health outcomes and knowledge acquisition compared to situations without a DA [14,83,127,133,136,167,189]. Given the development of natural language understanding, speech processing, and multimodal interfaces, DA will pervade all major areas of human activity soon.\nReports on the advantages of DAs cumulate. However, it remains an open question how DA accomplish those improvements, i.e., what characteristics of the DA, the situation, or the user, as well as what social and cognitive processes on the user's side are involved in yielding enhanced outcomes. DA trigger social and emotional processing apart from a goal-oriented response in the user [139,197], so conventional models of human-technology interaction and existing design guidance are of limited use. At the same time, the design space for DA is larger than in conventional user interfaces: each word, utterance, or atomic behavior of a DA can generate an undesired reaction from the user [83], and might need careful consideration from the designer. DA developers are frequently overwhelmed by this task and lack specific guidance on how to design an artefact that potentially will be considered a social entity by the user [167]. IS needs both theories of the interaction between users and DA for a better understanding of what happens in such settings and, ultimately, to render the much-needed guidance. In this manuscript, we attend to an application domain with a long tradition of employing DA: education. We use it as a context for theorizing the interaction between a human user and a DA, while identifying challenges relevant to IS more generally.\nUse of DA in education is a controversial topic. Past research shows that DAs have positive impacts on the cognitive and emotional aspects of learning [9], but also generate concerns regarding"}, {"title": "PEDAGOGICAL AGENTS WITHIN AN ACTIVITY SYSTEM", "content": "To establish a framework for the analysis of PA, we turn to AT.

We introduce the core concepts of AT, including their source and primary meaning, and proceed to open questions emerging in pedagogy and IS. We conclude by developing an activity system for learning with a pedagogical agent."}, {"title": "Activity Theory in Education", "content": "The origins of AT go back to Russian psychology of the 1920s \u20131930s. In the early works of Vygotsky, the founder of AT, the theory was used to explain development of the human mind, especially the acquisition of language or scientific concepts by children [41,102,115,183,184]. The basic mechanism identified by Vygotsky was the mediation, which enables the human subject to approach an external object by means of psychological and material tools [41,183]. Accordingly, an activity is an interaction between the subject and the object mediated by a set of tools and oriented at transforming the object [41,114] (cf. Figure 5a). Activities are distinguished by their objects; the intention to transform the object motivates activity [114]. While material tools form extensions of a human body and provide new embodied stimuli (e.g., a hammer in use), psychological tools, including language or sign systems, mediate thoughts [115]. Thereby material tools can exercise a reverse, reciprocal action, i.e., they are not simply employed by the subject to the objects in the world, but they also enable the subject to develop new psychological functions [41,102,115,183] \u2013 to learn. The AT was formulated as a way to overcome\nLeontyev, a student and colleague of Vygotsky, extended the AT to the collective aspects of activity. Accordingly, development of the human mind is not limited to an individual's interaction with an external object, but happens in a social context that gives meaning to the activities of members of the community [102,103,120]. Also, many tools emerge in a social interaction (e.g., language, signs) and only later get appropriated for individual use [102,120]. Human activities can be very complex, requiring many separate steps and various tools, such that proficiency in each aspect cannot be maintained by a single individual [102]. This leads to the emergence of division of labor and rules and norms that help maintain the distribution of activities between the subject and the community [120]. Leontyev's take on AT helped in overcoming the dichotomy between individual and collective activities, including situated collective activity as a core aspect of human development and learning, showing that improvement within an individual is not reducible to detached individual actions but requires social action [98].\nEven though Leontyev explained the role of community in human activity, only decades later, did Engestr\u00f6m formulate an activity system as a framework for analysis of six interconnected components: subject, object, tool, community, rules, and division of labor [68,69,71]. Additionally, Engestr\u00f6m [68] identifies four higher-order functions within the primary activity system: production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, that arise from mutual relations between the components of each subsystem (cf. Figure 5b) [68,89,98]. Production is oriented at the outcome of the activity system and leads to the\ndevelopment of an object that meets the subject's need by means of available tools. Distribution ties the object of the activity to the community by dividing it among its members. Exchange regulates the activities of the system in terms of personal needs of the subject and the members of the community. Finally, consumption describes the collaborative actions of the subject and the community on the object, while resources are consumed to transform the object. Overall, an activity system describes components and functions involved in transforming an object to meet the needs of a subject.\nThe works of Engestr\u00f6m mark the beginning of popularization of the AT in Western research on pedagogy and education [86,154]. Engestr\u00f6m's work on adult learning and organizational change has significant impacts on the conceptual structure of AT. He moved the focus of AT towards interconnected ensembles of activity systems which enabled the study of interrelations among multiple activities involving multiple subjects [71,103] (cf. Figure 5c), e.g., as in a situation when a patient is treated in a hospital first (one activity system) but then the local doctor (another activity system) takes care of her recovery. Based on empirical studies, he then identified contradictions and conflicts between and within activity systems as the reason behind their evolution, e.g., as in a situation when a new tool introduced into an activity system contradicts existing social rules and norms [69,102]. This mechanism provides conceptualization for collective learning. Engestr\u00f6m's concepts were widely adopted in pedagogy and education as a tool for analysis and intervention in schools and other educational settings [82,142,154].\nA full review of AT in pedagogy goes beyond the scope of this article, but the above summary brings some limitations to the surface. First, AT relies on differentiation between social agents (e.g., subject, community) and non-social entities (e.g., tools). Given the increasing hybridization of technologies and humans in the context of education (social networks, massive online open courses, PA), it remains uncertain whether and how AT can accommodate those developments [103,160] and what component of the AT can be associated with non-living entities that behave socially and can be perceived by humans as behaving in accordance with an internal, or even externally-imposed, intention [143,160,164]. Second, AT (like other general-purpose theories of human activity) relies on a black-box concept of the tool [103] \u2013 its singular elements or features and their impact on producing the desired outcome remain unpacked. The pedagogical AT literature contains various examples of tools including computer-based learning software [81], conversations, questions, or group session [175], and textbooks, computers, or even human agents like professors [98]. This short list readily illustrates how the\nunderstanding of tools differs across studies and sub-disciplines. Unpacking various technologies and analyzing their properties is central to understanding how they impact the learning outcome [103]. Despite these limitations, AT has proven to be a very useful framework for study and development of education: it acknowledges that learning occurs most naturally and meaningfully in the context of an activity [98], in which the cognition is distributed across people and artefacts [178], and it paved the way to successful and effective interventions in educational and organizational contexts [67].\nThird, AT originally framed the acquisition of new psychological functions as a consequence of reciprocal action between the subject and the object, mediated via the tool [102,114,184], but the instantiations of those concepts vary significantly. For instance, there is an ongoing debate as to what should be considered the object of a learner's activity [70]. Many applications of AT in the context of education position \"the learner's knowledge\u201d as the object of learner's activity, and claim that enhancing the learner's knowledge is the goal of the activity with higher knowledge as the outcome [163,170,177]. This view is criticized as one that assumes a perspective detached from the actual motives of the learner, which are likely to be related to the current situation and the social context: better grades, finishing the course, securing a position within the class or in society, etc. [174]. Others see the school text and other materials as object, while also observing that in traditional school settings, this object is detached from motives and the intended outcome [70]. Jonassen [98] has already pointed towards a tendency to establish overly abstract objects in AT studies and calls for a deeper yet pragmatic reflection on this component. Since the activity is constructed from the subject's perspective [103,159], we think it necessary to reconsider what the object of learning is. We claim that the learner is oriented towards the learning task which she strives to complete. This might be preparing for an exam to complete the course and acquire relevant qualifications, solving a homework assignment to collect bonus points, or preparing a presentation to establish expertise among co-learners or in the classroom. Through the activity the learner transforms the learning task from unsolved to solved or complete, meanwhile identifying her knowledge gaps or insufficient skills, which we refer to as competency gaps, and filling those gaps through acquisition of capabilities by consulting the school text, teachers, co-learners, and other sources. In this way, she obtains a new competency: that of solving the learning task. This does not however, mean that the learner's competency prior to the activity is irrelevant; the notion of a learner's competency as an object might be relevant to the teacher [70], who strives to make progress with regard\nto the curriculum. The teacher uses learning tasks to control the learners' knowledge and direct their efforts to discover competency gaps and fill them [119,146]. Accordingly, the intermediate collective objects are the gaps in learners' knowledge and skills, and the ultimate outcome is the completed learning task and the competency to solve this task, which, for the teacher, implies that the learner made a validated curricular progress, and for the learner implies success in obtaining the grade, passing the exam, or receiving a formal or informal acknowledgement of her qualifications.\""}, {"title": "Activity Theory in Information Systems", "content": "In the last three decades, AT was adopted in information systems (IS) and related computer-science sub-disciplines like HCI or computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW). Increasing application of AT in IS aligns with the quest for a powerful meta-theory that accommodates the contextual and situational nature of IT as an alternative to earlier decontextualized rationality-based theories [13]. First, it was used to analyze IS interventions and resulting organizational change, for instance, in healthcare [3] or in web-based communication [199]. Second, it was applied to inform the design and development of digital tools while moving the focus from a single-user interaction to activity in a social and material context [12,29,99]. Finally, it was proposed as a core theory for practice-oriented research in HCI [102,114] \u2013 the focus of which has moved away from labs and experiments to real-world fieldwork and applications. Despite the sustainable impact on some sub-communities, like the European CSCW, the use of AT for analysis of the most recent and innovative developments in technology remains scarce.\nThis gap might result from the unclear position of technology in the activity system. While most IS or HCI researchers identify digital technologies with tools [3,102,114], opposing voices [159,160,174] claim that current technological developments go beyond the notion of a tool as defined in status-quo AT. Referring to social media and Web 2.0, R\u00fcckriem [160] doubts whether the current generation of AT can accommodate those technological developments and proposes to include the notion of a medium within the AT model. Leontyev concludes that the computer technologies form a new leading medium \u2013 not a material one but a digital one and that tools exist within a reality shaped by the new medium [160]. This allows for a more contemporary re-conceptualization of tools as singular functionalities in a complex sociotechnical system.\nAnother critique of AT is related to notions of subject and human agency. The core of an activity is an object-oriented, motive-driven act of a conscious subject [102,114]. Consequently, being a subject is tightly related to being a human, an animal, or a social entity (e.g., an organization), because only those can do things driven by an inner biological or cultural need [102]. Non-biological entities manifest intentions of others, so are capable only of conditional and delegated agency [102] \u2013 they engage in lower level actions and operations [98,102], but not in meaningful activities. However, recent developments in hybrid intelligence [43], in which humans and machines establish highly interwoven assemblages with agency, challenge those assumptions [11]. In such assemblages, engagement in an activity can emerge through shared cognition between a human and a machine. Moreover, following Leontyev, R\u00fcckriem claims that digital technologies enable collectivization and externalization of human organs, including human mental abilities, such that computers could conduct actions detached from humans [11,160]. Consequently, it might be possible to acknowledge digital technology not only as a medium or tool, but also as a subject or member of the community. Even though conscious artificial agents are futuristic, we are surrounded by agents which seem to possess motives or needs and act accordingly. Rozendaal et al. [159] use Dennett's theory of intentionality [46] to propose the notion of objects with intent. Things like a lamp, a clock, a door or a coffee machine have the ability to act autonomously. Dennett claims that because humans attribute intentions to objects, their interaction with the world is altered: based on the ascribed intentions, humans can explain behaviors of animals and non-living things [46]. Applied to computers and digital agents, the theory of intentionality aligns with the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm in which humans apply social heuristics, rules, and expectations to interaction with computers seen as having social attributes [138,139,157]. An ongoing scientific debate concerns the claims and implications of CASA, delivering both empirical studies supporting the theory and others questioning its assumptions [5,66,74,117,135,176]. On the topic of motives and needs, humans have been shown to ascribe intentions to robots and avatars [128,143,164] as well as algorithms that directly impact their actions [176]. However, the existing results are not conclusive on what exactly causes a human to assume that a DA acts according to an internal, autonomous intention or one infused by the designer [128,164]. For example, Rozendaal et al. [159] conclude that a tool, such as a ball mediating a game, can be perceived by the human subject as a quasi-subject one moment, and soon after as a tool without agency. Overall, the idea of agency and its centrality to the definition of subject in an activity system is a challenge given the rapid development of new autonomous systems."}, {"title": "Learning-with-PA Model (LPAM) \u2013 Activity Theory for Pedagogical Agents", "content": "Despite some shortcomings and limitations, activity theory offers a framework with an extended history in pedagogy and in IS, and previously has been applied successfully to analyze and classify the impact of technologies like serious gaming, mobile learning, or e-learning in educational contexts [25,31,70,81,104,124]. It was however, never applied to study of PA. Still, we argue that AT is useful for a conceptualization of learning with pedagogical agent for several reasons: 1) The rationale of the theory is to understand human development and learning and so it has been used extensively in pedagogy, and its components are established in this context, 2) AT acknowledges the social and material character of learning as opposed to cognitive or mental processes of the learner so AT seems well suited to an understanding of the impact of a PA, and 3) AT can be used for analysis as well as for designing interventions \u2013 by proposing this framework, we hope to contribute not only towards the understanding of PA but also to designing such agents. Yet we acknowledge that deriving a framework based on AT is a challenge and requires significant conceptual adaptations. So our model represents an ensemble of interdependent activity systems associated with the activity learning with a pedagogical agent. We refer to this model as LPAM (learning with a pedagogical agent model) and to its two activity systems as LPAM-LAS (learning with a pedagogical agent model \u2013 learner's activity system) and LPAM-PAAS (learning with a pedagogical agent model \u2013 pedagogical agent's activity system).\nWe rely on Engestr\u00f6m's [68] formulation of an activity system as consisting of the six interconnected elements illustrated in Figure 5b. We also use Engestr\u00f6m's concept of the interdependence of activity systems (cf. Figure 5c). Interdependent activity systems consist of at least two activity systems which have a partially or fully shared outcome [72]. Typical examples are provider-customer relationships, hospital-caretaker-patient relationships, or teaching-and-school-going [70,72]. In interconnected activity systems, objects move from the situational \u201craw material\u201d state through a collectively meaningful state to a set of transformed objects, i.e., outcome, including the shared outcome [71]. In LPAM, this embraces the transition from the learning task and the learner's competency over collectively identified competency gaps which prevent the student from completing the task, to the completed learning task and new competency. The completed learning task is a transformation of the learning task because it changes the ontological status of the task, e.g., if the learning task is a homework assignment missing a solution, the completed learning task is the assignment with a solution; if the learning task is the content that needs to be learned for an exam the completed learning task is the memorized content. It is also a transformation of the learner's competency, which is expanded by the activity if the learner already possessed relevant competency or established when solving the learning task if she did not. Accordingly, the new competence is also a transformation of the learner's competency and the task: through the learning task, the learner together with the PA, identifies the missing competency and attempts to acquire it to solve the learning task. In short, the new competency is the learner's ability to solve the given learning task. In formulating additional outcomes for each side (e.g., better test scores, progress through the curriculum), we allow for the fact that participants often have pragmatic motives when engaged in a learning activity [98,174]. Importantly, interdependent activity systems not only share objects and/or outcomes, but might transfer resources or rely on the same context, as shown by examples from previous AT research in pedagogical contexts [70,71,72].\nIn the proposed framework, we also employ the theory of intentionality by Dennett [46] going beyond what Rozendaal et al. [159] proposed about the agency of digital agents. LPAM-PAAS describes an activity system with the PA as a subject. This clearly challenges the need-based agency assumption of AT, because existing PAs are far from being conscious entities with their own needs. However, LPAM-PAAS is not a system found in the external world, but rather an activity system that might be assumed or perceived by the learner who ascribes intentions and agency to the PA, as is likely if the"}, {"title": "METHOD", "content": "To understand how the design of a pedagogical agent impacts the learning outcome, i.e., the amount and quality of acquired knowledge or mastered skills, we analyze previous studies addressing the topic of LPA. Specifically, we consider studies in which learning outcome was measured as a dependent variable and at least one aspect of the pedagogical agent was manipulated (e.g., male vs female voice), or a quality of the agent (e.g., voice quality) was treated as an independent variable (also, explanatory variable or input variable). In doing so, we identify aspects of a PA with potential influence on the measured learning outcome. Of course, by following this method, we cannot measure or consider any potential interferences among the various variables, though it is also impossible that these aspects are independent from each other (e.g., projecting humanoid character is hard if the learner can only hear but not see an agent). Also, the variety of measures, manipulations, and experimental designs applied in the considered studies makes it nearly impossible to treat them as equivalent in any respect, except that they focus on an individual learner interacting with a PA. Therefore, we resort to identifying and providing an overview of the relevant aspects and classify them according to the framework described in section 2.3 and illustrated in Figure 6. While this cannot provide a conclusive answer on whether an agent designed to combine the various features will have positive impact on the learning outcome, it is sufficient to establish a catalogue of design decisions and identify areas that require further investigation.\nTo select the relevant studies, we employed a systematic, concept-centric literature review [17,121,187] using the following procedure. First, we selected the sources to be included in the initial search. We decided to consider the top 25% of outlets from the following disciplines according to the Scimago Journal Ranking (SJR) as used in the Elsevier Scopus database: Education, Educational Psychology, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Systems. This resulted in a\ncollection of 1,137 outlets including journals and proceedings of scientific conferences. Since Scopus provides search capabilities for title, abstract, keywords, and other bibliographical data for all those outlets, we limited our search to this database. Second, based on seed literature and recent publications from the most relevant outlets in each discipline (e.g., Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, Computer and Education, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems) we identified a set of terms used to denote a PA (or a related concept) and a set of the most influential authors, whose publications were used to adjust the list of terms. The list included 31 different terms (e.g., natural language tutor, animated pedagogical agent, or tutoring system). We reduced the list to the following query for search in Scopus:\n(\"conversational\"|\"dialogue-based\"|\"dialogue\"|\"natural-language\"\n|\"intelligent\"|\"animated\"|\"embodied\"|\"social\"|\"cognitive\"|\"adaptive\")\nAND (\"pedagogic* agent\"|\"pedagogic* robot\"|\"tutor* system\"\n|\"tutor* agent\"|\"tutor* robot\"|\"robot tutor\"|\"computer tutor\")\nAND (\"educat*\"|\"learn*\"|\"stud*\"|\"teach*\").\nImportantly, the operator 'AND' does not imply that the terms are concatenated, but it means that the terms on the left and on the right of the operator need to appear in the title, abstract, or the keywords, but may be separated by other words. \u2018|' stands for logical disjunction. The search in Scopus resulted in 775 articles between 1973 and August 31, 2020, with 431 published in 2010 or later. Third, we excluded articles according to the following criteria applied in the given order: (a) conceptual articles without empirical basis (n=60), (b) meta-studies and reviews (n=18), (c) studies addressing ITS or other tutoring systems that do not allow for natural-language interaction with the agent (e.g., systems that control user input during a task to later mark the step in which the learner made a mistake; n=607), (d) studies which do not measure learning outcome or learning performance in any form (n=82), (e) studies conducted in contexts where learning outcome is impossible to assess (e.g., creative teams; n=13), and (f) studies in which a group of learners interact synchronously with a PA (e.g., PA as a classroom assistant; n=5). After application of the exclusion criteria, we selected 51 articles for further analysis. Based on the backward and forward search rooting of those articles and the partially relevant literature reviews [9,96,113,141,148,194], we identified 74 more potentially relevant articles which, after application of the exclusion criteria, expanded the number of selected articles by 13. They passed the same filtering\nprocedure as the keyword-search-based results. Overall, 852 were considered during the selection process, and 64 were chosen for the analysis. Application of the criteria was conducted by a full-time researcher and all controversial cases were discussed with other authors, so the final in-or-out decision was made collectively. Lastly, a second postdoctoral researcher screened all selected articles for their agreement with the criteria. All 64 selected articles were included in the subsequent analysis.\nThe analysis was oriented at identification of contextual and design aspects that influence the learning outcome during LPA. We proceeded as follows: All relevant studies were described in terms of the measured learning outcome (dependent variables), differences between treatments, i.e., manipulated aspects, explicit control variables (independent variables, or factors), and the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. This enabled us to identify those aspects of the design or context that were reportedly tested concerning their influence on the learning outcome 2. If an article describes more than one independent experiment, each was considered separately. If an experiment uses factorial design (two or more factors define experimental condition), each factor was treated separately as a design aspect and explicit results for that factor were considered. If such results were not provided and no direct impact of the factor on the learning outcome could be established, but the results indicated that the impact is moderated or dependent on another variable, the interaction between the factor and the dependent variable was marked as mixed. Similarly, if the experiment provided contradictory results (e.g., highest level of factor A leads to high learning gain, medium level of factor A leads to negative learning gain, and low level of factor A leads to high learning gain again), we marked them as mixed. Otherwise, we classified the interaction as univocal and described the interaction as positive (learning outcome grows if factor A grows), negative (learning outcome falls if factor A grows), or having an impact in explicit terms (e.g., condition-1 > condition-2 means that learners in condition-1 have higher learning outcomes than in condition-2). If no significant impact could be identified, the interaction was marked as neutral. The identified factors were matched subsequently with the LPAM components (cf. Figure 6) in a workshop involving all authors of the current manuscript and guest researchers. This should"}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": "Learner and PA as activity subjects\nThe examined articles contain research on several different activity subject categories, both on LPAM-PAAS and LPAM-LAS. With respect to the learners, the subjects are differentiated by age and then their educational context, as described in\nIn terms of PA subjects, four categories can be distinguished: chatbots, cartoon agents, human-like agents, and robots (cf. Table 6). The category of chatbots includes pedagogical agents that solely use text-based or voice-based natural language to communicate and do not have an embodied representation of any kind. For instance the NLtoFOL system, developed to train learners to translate natural language to first-order logic, has been equipped with a chat-based agent to guide learners through a series of tasks by giving them hints and feedback via automatically generated natural language sentences [152]. Cartoon agents depict an animal or an abstract being that does not resemble humans but might have human-like mimic or gesturing behavior. They use either text or speech to communicate with learners and can be either animated, including anthropomorphic features, or static, with a trend toward\nanimated agents. Such agents are used for a variety of tasks, including examination of the effect of facial expressions on learners [2], whether the simple presence of a PA [198] in different forms [24] (no agent, voice only, static agent, full agent) makes a difference in the motivational and learning outcomes, or to test how a gesturing agent performs in comparison to a non-gesturing agent [34]. In contrast to cartoon agents, human-like agents possess visual features. Although computer animated, they are purposefully designed to look human. Some of them are simply talking heads, others show a virtual upper body or even full human body. While some talking heads are explicitly used to test the effect of PA enthusiasm [125], personality [10], and rapport behavior [112] on the learners, others are again used to test how the (visual) presence or absence of a PA affects learning outcomes [131]. Full-body human-like PAs can be used to combine instructions, practice and feedback in one agent by having the learners perform actions on the body and the environment of the agent [23]. Lastly, robots are used least frequently and predominantly with young children as learners. Using speech and physical signaling, these robots interact with children and teach them multiplication [110] or play word-learning games [28]."}, {"title": "LPAM-based Analysis of Impact on Learning Outcomes", "content": "The articles relied upon consider very diverse subjects. Yet, we found even more variety in relevant outcome measures. In particular, learning outcomes are measured using a broad selection of constructs ranging from multiple-choice verbatim knowledge questions, i.e., questions directly from the PA asking for information [22], to measurement of whether the learner can apply the knowledge to solve a task in mathematics or logics [34,152] or a vocabulary test [28], to deriving measurement, e.g., knowledge monitoring assessment comparing the learner's judgment about her knowledge with task performance to assess her metacognition abilities [105]. In the last case, the learning outcome is the learner's self-assessment competency. Sometimes studies refer to learning gains as tested by a pre-treatment and post-treatment test (short, pre- and post-test), others use only a post-test, mostly administered directly after treatment, but sometimes delayed. All this makes it impossible to combine results from separate studies\nand provide a conclusive, bottom-line answer on how an aspect impacts the learning outcome, even if some studies attend to the same or a similar aspect. Further difficulty arises from the specific experimental conditions: if a design aspect, e.g., presence or absence of a voice-based narration, is tested with different PA types, e.g., a social robot and a virtual human, and with different learning task, e.g., foreign language conversation or solving mathematical problems, it is hard to argue for the comparability of the studies. Consequently, we provide a catalogue of tested aspects and their impact on learning outcomes in a study-by-study manner in the virtual appendix available from the Journal's website.\nFigure 7 summarizes the quantitative analysis and explicitly links it with the LPAM. The figure uses various shadows of red for LPAM-LAS and various shadows of blue for LPAM-PAAS. The analysis shows which components and which aspects were attended to most. For instance, the most studies attend to the subject of LPAM-PAAS (overall 30 studies, of which twelve suggest positive or negative influence of an aspect on the learning outcome, seven provide mixed results, and eleven provide neutral results suggesting no influence on the learning outcome). 16 studies attend to how visual and bodily presence of the PA impacts the learning outcome: six suggest that more visual and bodily presence will enhance the learning outcome, one suggests the opposite, i.e., that reducing the visual and bodily presence will enhance the learning outcome, three studies provide mixed results, and six studies suggest that there is no correlation between the visual and bodily presence of a PA and the learning outcome. On the LPAM-LAS side, most studies (nine of them) attend to the learner, i.e., the subject component in this activity system, of which six investigate the relationship between the prior knowledge of the learner and the outcome resulting from a learning episode with a PA. Four of them yield mixed results, suggesting that there is a relationship between the prior knowledge and the learning outcome when the learner uses a PA, but the relationship is not monotonic. for example, higher or lower prior knowledge does not imply better or worse learning outcome. Instead, the relationship involves moderators or sub-categories."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": "Applying the AT perspective to the studies on PA shows that much effort is put toward understanding how inherent attributes of a PA or the way it interacts with the learner influence the learning outcome. The studies consider various combinations of visual, bodily, and verbal presence, as well as implement various behavior schemas employed by PA. However, many areas remain barely touched, especially the collaborative aspects of the activity: rules, division of labor, and role of the community attract less attention from researchers despite a large variety of settings to be examined. Even though PA have attracted some interest from IS [191,192,194], attending to the collaborative components of the learning activity could position this class of systems at the core of IS interest [13,15,162]. The sociotechnical nature of LPA and the likelihood of its becoming increasingly pervasive with natural language processing capability and increased distributed learning created by the COVID-19 pandemic, calls for IS researchers to engage. In Section 5.1, we approach the subsystems of the LPA, identify emerging questions, and link them to IS discourses. We claim that research on improving learning by means of PA can benefit from IS competence as presented below. However, IS can benefit from PA research to inform the design of DA beyond education as well. We attend to this aspect in 5.1 and explicitly discuss it in 5.2."}, {"title": "Critical Reflection on the State-of-the-Art", "content": "LPAM: PA's Activity System\nLPAM-PAAS \u2013 Production Subsystem: This subsystem focuses on how the subject transforms the object by means of the available tools. Within the LPAM, this is the subsystem with the most contributions, primarily due to the many studies of the tools and the PA as a subject of the activity. The studies of the production subsystem try to establish links between technical and methodological aspects of PA's design and the learning outcomes. Most of them manipulate the PA, so that in one condition it is a little bit more human-like than in the others, e.g., presented by an avatar vs. not, or using richer channels for transmitting the message, e.g., by combining voice"}]}

In doing so, we use the work of Randall Collins and his state breakdown model to exemplify that, already today, Al-based models can help synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources, reason about the world, and apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way. However, we also find that Al-driven social theory remains subject to a range of practical, technical, and epistemological limitations. Most critically, existing Al-systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful. These are (1) semanticization, i.e., the ability to develop and operationalize verbal concepts to represent machine-manipulable knowledge; (2) transferability, i.e., the ability to transfer what has been learned in one context to another; and (3) generativity, i.e., the ability to independently create and improve on concepts and models. We argue that if the gaps identified here are addressed by further research, there is no reason why, in the future, the most advanced programme in social theory should not be led by Al-driven cumulative advances.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In this paper, we sketch a programme for Al-driven social theory. First, we define what we mean by artificial intelligence (AI) in this context. We go on to outline a model for how Al-systems can leverage the growing availability of data to test hypotheses and generate new theories. Next, we give an example where computer-aided theory has already been put forward and tested; namely, Collins' state breakdown model. We then discuss the strengths and gaps of current Al techniques in relation to the task of advancing social theory. Finally, we point to some obstacles that lie ahead, as well as to reasons why Al-driven social theory is nevertheless likely to progress. We conclude with some implications for social science.\nBefore we begin, a quite abstract question should be addressed: what is social theory good, or useful, for? One purpose of theory is to guide knowledge cumulation (Schroeder 2019). It does so by synthesizing what is known in terms of generalizations in the social sciences. However, a review of the field a quarter of a century ago identified one of the problems with this view, which can be quoted in full: 'The general public, to the extent that it has any opinion of social theory at all, probably considers it to be mere ideology. So long as theories are mere meditations punctuated with dubious metaphors, there is little defense against this accusation. ASI [Artificial Social Intelligence] and mathematical formalism are compatible methods for stating a theory precisely, connecting its concepts in rigorous intellectual structures, and identifying both hidden assumptions and unexpected consequences' (Bainbridge et al. 1994: 431). Another aim of linking social theory and Al could be to focus knowledge cumulation on particularly acute social problems and how to tackle them. We will return to the question of how social theory can be applied to social problems on several occasions. But whether social theory is primarily problem-driven or driven by cumulation, it always focuses on gaps in knowledge and moving knowledge beyond what is known, which, as we shall see, overlaps with the aims of Al research.\nDespite the shared commitment to cumulate knowledge, however, there are also differences between Al research and social science. One is that, in comparison with the natural world, social science or social theory comes up against allegedly greater complexity in dealing with the social world. This complexity is sometimes linked to the reflexivity of social science, whereby the very observation of society affects and is affected by knowledge. Another facet of this complexity is the inherent unpredictability of social phenomena. Yet both of these ideas are misguided: social theory can be predictive, and the social world is separate from observers, as is the natural world. It is not the complexities or reflexive ties between knowledge and social development that limit social theory. There are, however, other limits to our ability to model the social world, such as how well various kinds of models fit the social world (see Page 2018) and how problems in social theory such as the macro- micro- linkage can be tackled (to be discussed below). Though obviously not the only way forward, a major opportunity to push the boundaries"}, {"title": "2. Operationalizing Al to advance social theory", "content": "There is no widely accepted definition of Al. Rather, practitioners across different disciplines define, interpret, and operationalize Al in quite different ways. However, it is possible to discern three main ways of understanding the term: Al can refer to either: a) an academic discipline, i.e., a branch of computer science; b) an agent that is characterized by high levels of autonomy, adaptability, and other specific competencies; or c) a set of technologies or tools and methods that collect and process data. John McCarthy, an early Al pioneer who is often credited with having coined the term, mainly championed the first of these conceptualizations. According to McCarthy, Al is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines (McCarthy 2007). The second way of conceptualizing Al can be illustrated by reference to Wang (1995), who focuses on the ability of an intelligent agent to 'adopt to its environment with insufficient knowledge and resources', or to Albus (1991), who stipulates that an intelligent agent is one that can 'act appropriately so as to increase the probability of achieving complex goals'.

But how could Al-based models help advance social theory in"}, {"title": "4. Al and Social Theory: the example of Randall Collins and State Breakdown Theory", "content": "In order to flesh out what role Al could play in developing social theory, we will now turn to examine one particular social theorist more closely; Randall Collins (see Loyal and Malesevic, 2021: 376-96, for an overview of Collins' work). Our focus on an individual theorist may seem at odds with the scientific method which assesses the validity of hypotheses or theories and not individual thinkers. But as mentioned, it is not Collins as a theorist that we are interested in here, but rather Collins insofar as he put forward hypotheses or theories that can be tested using Al-based models. It can be added that Collins is highly reflective about the scientific nature of the social sciences, including cumulation (Collins and Sanderson 2016: 10-11), how statistics can be regarded as theory (Collins 1984), how simulation can be used for testing theories (Collins 1988: 511-18), and the idea that simulation and other computational approaches should not be regarded as only quantitative but also as qualitative (Collins 1999: Appendix A).\nThe main illustration that we would like to use here is Collins' prediction of the collapse or breakdown of the Soviet Union (originally published in 1980; see Collins 1999, chapter 2). This prediction was based on models derived from a long line of previous work on state breakdowns such as the French and Russian revolutions (Collins 1999, chapter 1). According to Collins' state breakdown model, there is a non-linear relationship between the size of a state territory, on the one hand, and its success in war, on the other (Collins 1999: p.42). Collins argues that societies with resources and marchland advantage ('marchland' are the boundaries between geopolitical units) are likely to have success in war. At the same time, however, territorial gains lead to increased logistical loads and, eventually to a more central, i.e., exposed, geopolitical position. Hence, expanding empires begin to stall at a certain size, as these points of resistance are aggravated. The details of this hypothesis or prediction about this collapse will not be given here. What is important is that the prediction can be visualized in terms of causal relations (Pearl and McKenzie 2018), spelling out with only a few arrows a 'geopolitical model' of what leads to this collapse (and other prior ones).\nFigure 3.

Limitations of Al-driven Social Theory", "content": "The approach suggested in this paper has been in keeping with the four principles of good Al design outlined in section 2. To reiterate, these stipulate that a good Al-model of social change should be cumulative (i.e., allow only scientific criteria to guide knowledge creation), holistic (i.e., encompass both macro- and micro-dynamics in relevant disciplines), open-ended (i.e., allow for the inclusion of ever-more"}, {"title": "7. Outlook for Al-driven Social Theory", "content": "Despite these limitations and objections, is it nevertheless possible to harness knowledge concerning the most pressing social needs in an objective way? One blueprint from the natural sciences are the attempts by Rockstroem and colleagues (Lade et al. 2020) to identify \u2018planetary boundaries'. This model works, as it were, backwards from the planetary boundaries to the most urgent tasks to stay within these boundaries in terms of resource conservation. Such an effort would entail prioritizing which of these efforts are likely to yield the maximum contribution in doing so. Perhaps something similar could be done with social science knowledge? If so, social theory could be directed at the most pressing issues, thereby reducing uncertainty. Al-driven social theory could then take into account the particular time-, space-, and resource horizons of social actors (including organizations and macro-actors) who (or which) aim to intervene in social life, and scientifically gauge the potential effect they can have in view of the predictability of what can happen next.\nWhich actors should be informed by what type of knowledge can itself be made subject to a learning process, and thus made more effective via a pipeline of knowledge inputs and outputs. However, again, such efforts must be scientific and steer away from activism and instead be problem-oriented. In any event, support for particular actors or social engineering is secondary to the goal of the observer of society; the social theorist or theories whose only goal is knowledge advance in relation to particular social phenomena - as opposed to the problem-oriented actor.\nThis is a good place to distinguish between prediction, as discussed in this paper, and global forecasting (see, for example, https://pardee.du.edu/). Forecasting is not cumulative unless it can be integrated into more useful and reliable social science knowledge. That is because forecasting has various 'scenarios' for the which the parameters vary. The same holds true for simulations, which are based on the constraints that social actors have to behave in certain ways, which can also be seen as forecasts.\nThese varying parameters also introduce trade-offs in terms of how much the analyses explain.

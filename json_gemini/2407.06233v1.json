Most critically, existing Al-systems lack three essential capabilities needed to advance social theory in ways that are cumulative, holistic, open-ended, and purposeful. These are (1) semanticization, i.e., the ability to develop and operationalize verbal concepts to represent machine-manipulable knowledge; (2) transferability, i.e., the ability to transfer what has been learned in one context to another; and (3) generativity, i.e., the ability to independently create and improve on concepts and models. We argue that if the gaps identified here are addressed by further research, there is no reason why, in the future, the most advanced programme in social theory should not be led by Al-driven cumulative advances.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "In this paper, we sketch a programme for Al-driven social theory. First, we define what we mean by artificial intelligence (AI) in this context. We go on to outline a model for how Al-systems can leverage the growing availability of data to test hypotheses and generate new theories. Next, we give an example where computer-aided theory has already been put forward and tested; namely, Collins' state breakdown model. We then discuss the strengths and gaps of current Al techniques in relation to the task of advancing social theory. Finally, we point to some obstacles that lie ahead, as well as to reasons why Al-driven social theory is nevertheless likely to progress. We conclude with some implications for social science.\nBefore we begin, a quite abstract question should be addressed: what is social theory good, or useful, for? One purpose of theory is to guide knowledge cumulation (Schroeder 2019). It does so by synthesizing what is known in terms of generalizations in the social sciences. However, a review of the field a quarter of a century ago identified one of the problems with this view, which can be quoted in full: 'The general public, to the extent that it has any opinion of social theory at all, probably considers it to be mere ideology. So long as theories are mere meditations punctuated with dubious metaphors, there is little defense against this accusation. ASI [Artificial Social Intelligence] and mathematical formalism are compatible methods for stating a theory precisely, connecting its concepts in rigorous intellectual structures, and identifying both hidden assumptions and unexpected consequences' (Bainbridge et al. 1994: 431). Another aim of linking social theory and Al could be to focus knowledge cumulation on particularly acute social problems and how to tackle them. We will return to the question of how social theory can be applied to social problems on several occasions. But whether social theory is primarily problem-driven or driven by cumulation, it always focuses on gaps in knowledge and moving knowledge beyond what is known, which, as we shall see, overlaps with the aims of Al research.\nDespite the shared commitment to cumulate knowledge, however, there are also differences between Al research and social science. One is that, in comparison with the natural world, social science or social theory comes up against allegedly greater complexity in dealing with the social world. This complexity is sometimes linked to the reflexivity of social science, whereby the very observation of society affects and is affected by knowledge. Another facet of this complexity is the inherent unpredictability of social phenomena. Yet both of these ideas are misguided: social theory can be predictive, and the social world is separate from observers, as is the natural world. It is not the complexities or reflexive ties between knowledge and social development that limit social theory. There are, however, other limits to our ability to model the social world, such as how well various kinds of models fit the social world (see Page 2018) and how problems in social theory such as the macro- micro- linkage can be tackled (to be discussed below). Though obviously not the only way forward, a major opportunity to push the boundaries"}, {"title": "2. Operationalizing Al to advance social theory", "content": "There is no widely accepted definition of Al. Rather, practitioners across different disciplines define, interpret, and operationalize Al in quite different ways. However, it is possible to discern three main ways of understanding the term: Al can refer to either: a) an academic discipline, i.e., a branch of computer science; b) an agent that is characterized by high levels of autonomy, adaptability, and other specific competencies; or c) a set of technologies or tools and methods that collect and process data. John McCarthy, an early Al pioneer who is often credited with having coined the term, mainly championed the first of these conceptualizations. According to McCarthy, Al is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines (McCarthy 2007). The second way of conceptualizing Al can be illustrated by reference to Wang (1995), who focuses on the ability of an intelligent agent to 'adopt to its environment with insufficient knowledge and resources', or to Albus (1991), who stipulates that an intelligent agent is one that can 'act appropriately so as to increase the probability of achieving complex goals'.

But how could Al-based models help advance social theory in"}, {"title": "4. Al and Social Theory: the example of Randall Collins and State Breakdown Theory", "content": "In order to flesh out what role Al could play in developing social theory, we will now turn to examine one particular social theorist more closely; Randall Collins (see Loyal and Malesevic, 2021: 376-96, for an overview of Collins' work). Our focus on an individual theorist may seem at odds with the scientific method which assesses the validity of hypotheses or theories and not individual thinkers. But as mentioned, it is not Collins as a theorist that we are interested in here, but rather Collins insofar as he put forward hypotheses or theories that can be tested using Al-based models. It can be added that Collins is highly reflective about the scientific nature of the social sciences, including cumulation (Collins and Sanderson 2016: 10-11), how statistics can be regarded as theory (Collins 1984), how simulation can be used for testing theories (Collins 1988: 511-18), and the idea that simulation and other computational approaches should not be regarded as only quantitative but also as qualitative (Collins 1999: Appendix A).\nThe main illustration that we would like to use here is Collins' prediction of the collapse or breakdown of the Soviet Union (originally published in 1980; see Collins 1999, chapter 2). This prediction was based on models derived from a long line of previous work on state breakdowns such as the French and Russian revolutions (Collins 1999, chapter 1). According to Collins' state breakdown model, there is a non-linear relationship between the size of a state territory, on the one hand, and its success in war, on the other (Collins 1999: p.42). Collins argues that societies with resources and marchland advantage ('marchland' are the boundaries between geopolitical units) are likely to have success in war. At the same time, however, territorial gains lead to increased logistical loads and, eventually to a more central, i.e., exposed, geopolitical position. Hence, expanding empires begin to stall at a certain size, as these points of resistance are aggravated. The details of this hypothesis or prediction about this collapse will not be given here. What is important is that the prediction can be visualized in terms of causal relations (Pearl and McKenzie 2018), spelling out with only a few arrows a 'geopolitical model' of what leads to this collapse (and other prior ones).\nFigure 3 above is a simplified visual representation of Collins state breakdown model. There are various visualizations of this model with greater complexity, for example in Turner's Macrodynamics (1995: 111). However, Collins' theory of geopolitics can also be formulated in terms of verbal propositions. As summarised by Turner (1991: 251), the collapse of an empire is a positive and additive function of: a) the initiation of war between two empires; b) the over-extension of an empire beyond its logistical capacity; and c) the adoption of its superior technologies by enemy states. While Turner's verbalization has greater complexity and more variables, the essence of the model remains that when resources are stretched too far, the outcome is a crisis of legitimation which, in turn, leads to state breakdown or collapse.\nCollins has discussed the nature of prediction in his model and assessed various alternative predictions and explanations, but he argues that his \u2018model' fares better. Instead of going into whether Collins outpredicts these rival explanations, our main point here is that Collins' model has been tested by others using computational methods, including sometime collaborators (Hanemann 1987) but also others who build on and extend or improve upon his work (see e.g., Turchin 2019: 16-28) and use his ideas as part of more comprehensive \u2013 not just state-breakdown related \u2013 testing of theories using computational models. Collins' state breakdown model, as outlined in Figure 3, could thus be inserted in an Al-based model (see Figure 1) as one hypothesis that is ranked against other competing hypotheses depending on their fit with data. Importantly, this process would both be constrained by - and help inform - the evaluation and ranking of social theories about other structures or phenomena at a systems' level (see figure 2, in which geopolitical stability could constitute one of several interdependent 'structures').\nIt should be remembered that for the Soviet collapse more generally, there were a limited number of explanations. These included, apart from geopolitics, factors such as the lack of openness of knowledge, or the lack of economic growth that provides legitimation for the regime (so-called performance legitimacy, which is also a factor often invoked for the legitimacy of the Chinese party state, see Zhao 2009). Crises in legitimacy have been used to explain state breakdowns drawing on Collins' insights by other scholars, including Goldstone (2020) and Turchin (2019). They, and others, can rely on readily available historical data sets to do so (see e.g., Turchin et al. 2018). They have also made predictions about the future based, among other things, on demographic forecasts. Again, they are able to do this by linking a small number of causal factors, and by setting bounds around the scope of the 'system' to be explained.\nAt this point, it is worth to briefly pursue a different set of Collins' ideas about Al. In a book chapter (1992) called 'Can sociology create an artificial intelligence?', Collins argued that, indeed, sociology can do this - but it would require a bottom-up approach, i.e., starting with micro-interactions. As mentioned in the introduction, a top-down approach to Al assumes that the rules of thinking need to be formalized in order to be reproduced in Al (for bottom-up versus top-down, see Mitchell 2019). Collins argues that"}, {"title": "5. The systems we need: strengths and gaps in current Al-systems", "content": "The example of Collins, combined with the brief description of the mechanisms underpinning Al-driven social theory earlier in section 3, now allows us to examine if and how advances in Al research can help such an approach to succeed. Looking to the future, adaptive and self-learning Al-systems hold promise for synthesizing knowledge from a variety of sources, reason flexibly and dynamically about the world, apply what is known across a wide range of problems in a systematic way, and transfer what is learned from one context to another (Marcus 2020). However, there is still a long road ahead. Despite recent advances, today's Al-based systems are subject to both technical and conceptual constraints that prevent their full potential from being realized.\nFrom a technical perspective, the sensors used by Al-based systems are still crude in comparison to those of humans. Because keeping track of the state of the world is one of the core requirements of highly potent Al-systems (Russell and Norvig 2015), a more precise and a more diverse set of sensors - or, in the case of social theory, data sources"}]}

A major challenge in clinical care and new therapeutics development is the lack of\nan objective measure for quantifying itch, leading to reliance on subjective measures like patients'\nself-assessment of itch severity. In this paper, we show that a home radio device paired with artificial\nintelligence (AI) can concurrently capture scratching and evaluate its impact on sleep quality by\nanalyzing radio signals bouncing in the environment. The device eliminates the need for wearable\nsensors or skin contact, enabling monitoring of chronic itch over extended periods at home without\nburdening patients or interfering with their skin condition. To validate the technology, we conducted\nan observational clinical study of chronic pruritus patients, monitored at home for one month using\nboth the radio device and an infrared camera. Comparing the output of the device to ground truth data\nfrom the camera demonstrates its feasibility and accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.997, sensitivity = 0.825,\nspecificity = 0.997). The results reveal a significant correlation between scratching and low sleep\nquality, manifested as a reduction in sleep efficiency (R = 0.6, p < 0.001) and an increase in sleep\nlatency (R = 0.68, p < 0.001). Our study underscores the potential of passive, long-term, at-home\nmonitoring of chronic scratching and its sleep implications, offering a valuable tool for both clinical\ncare of chronic itch patients and pharmaceutical clinical trials.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Chronic pruritus affects about 13% of the US population,\nresulting in an annual expenditure of over $90 billion [1].\nIt is as debilitating as chronic pain, profoundly impacting\nsleep and quality of life [2, 3, 4, 5]. A primary challenge\nin both itch management and drug development is the lack\nof an objective measure for quantifying itch [6]. Currently,\nthe clinical standard is the numerical rating scale (NRS),\nwhere patients rate the severity of their itch over the past\n24 hours on a scale from 0 (\"no itch\") to 10 (\"worst imag-\ninable itch\") [7]. Other assessment tools, like the visual\nalog scale (VAS) and the 5-D itch scale, exist but are\nsimilarly subjective [8, 9]. Such self-assessment meth-\nods lack sensitivity to small changes, are hard to compare\nacross patients, and can be unreliable in children and the el-\nderly, even though chronic itch is common in these groups\n[10, 11].\nNocturnal scratching has been seen as a promising objec-\ntive measure of itch [9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Scratching is ob-\njective, quantifiable, and has been routinely measured in an-\nimal studies to assess itch [17]. It has also been shown sen-\nsitive across different types of itch including inflammatory,\nneuropathic, and even dry skin itch [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\nYet, monitoring nocturnal scratching in humans is chal-\nlenging. The straightforward approach involves installing\ninfrared (IR) cameras in patients' bedrooms. Human ob-\nservers then review the videos and annotate scratching\noccurrences\nraises pri-\nvacy concerns and incurs excessive overhead and costs due\nto the extensive volume of video footage that needs manual\nreview. Additionally, clinical trials for chronic itch require\ndaily assessments over several months [23, 24, 25], exac-\nerbating privacy and cost concerns. Automating this task\nwith computer vision is not straightforward either, as much\nscratching occurs under blankets and needs scrutiny and\nconsensus from multiple human labelers. Consequently,\nwhile video recording is recognized as the ground truth for\nscratching, it is deemed impractical for extensive use in\nclinical trials or care.\nThe challenges with video monitoring have led researchers\nto explore wearable devices resulting in hundreds of pa-\npers on the topic\nTable S1 in the supplementary material summarizes this\nliterature. The most prevalent method employs wrist actig-\nraphy to monitor scratching. The performance of wrist\nactigraphy however is relatively low [28, 30, 32], which\nhas led some researchers to propose soft sensors mounted\non the back of the hand with adhesive support to offer bet-\nter accuracy [26, 27]. However, removal and re-adhesion\nof such sensors increases the risk of skin irritation, particu-\nlarly in clinical trials which typically last several months\n[23, 24, 25]. Additionally, wearable devices detect scratch-\ning only if performed with the hand wearing the device,\nbut it is common for patients to scratch with other body\nparts or rub against bed sheets.\nThus, despite significant advancements, there remains a\nneed for an objective, accurate scratching measure that is\nnot limited to hand movements and can monitor scratching\nfor months without the potential of interfering with skin\ncondition. Ideally, this solution can concurrently evaluate\nscratching and its impact on sleep. Impaired sleep dras-\ntically affects itch patients' quality of life and has been\nlinked to neurocognitive deficits in children with chronic\neczema [11] and cardiovascular death in patient with ure-\nmic pruritus [36].\nHere, we introduce a new approach that simultaneously\nmeasures scratching and sleep in an objective, sensitive,\nprivacy-preserving, and contactless manner. We build on,\nand expand, recent literature that demonstrated the feasi-\nbility of using radio frequency (RF) signals to passively\nmeasure physiological signals (e.g., motion, vital signs,\nand sleep) in Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, COVID-19, and\nothers [37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]. Our approach uses a\nradio device that sits in the background of the home like\na Wi-Fi router. It sends out wireless signals (1000 times\nlower power than home Wi-Fi) and collects their reflections\nfrom the environment and nearby people [37, 38, 39, 44,\n45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. We\nzoom in on radio signals reflected from the participant's\nbed using beamforming techniques [48, 57]. We then ana-\nlyze these radio signals using custom neural networks to\ninfer nocturnal scratching and sleep. To infer scratching\ninstances, we develop a novel neural network model. The\nnetwork first identifies repetitive motion patterns that char-\nacterize scratching, then processes those patterns to output\na time series labeled with the occurrence of scratching. To\ninfer sleep, we leverage a pre-existing AI model for sleep\nmonitoring using radio signals [56, 57]. Crucially, our\nmethod is unobtrusive, eliminating the need for patients to\nwear sensors or self-report symptom severity."}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Study Participants", "content": "Twenty adults diagnosed with chronic itch (with an In-\nvestigator's Global Assessment (IGA) mean of 2.8 and a\nstandard deviation of 1.5) were recruited for a prospec-\ntive observational study and provided informed consent\nunder IRB 201811086. All participants reported itching\nfor a minimum of 6 weeks prior to enrollement. The study\naimed to validate the efficacy of utilizing radio signals for\nscratching detection and evaluate the correlation between\nscratching and sleep parameters. To ensure the evaluation\nof scratching detection's accuracy was independent of the\nspecific itch condition, we selected participants spanning\na range of pruritus diagnoses, including atopic dermatitis\n(AD), prurigo nodularis (PN), and chronic pruritus of un-\nknown origin (CPUO). Demographics and baseline disease\ncharacteristics are shown in Table 1.\nThe participants were monitored at home for 4 weeks using\nboth the radio device and an infrared camera installed in the\nbedroom. Participants were asked to report their daily NRS\nand sleep scores (on a scale of 0 to 10) for at least 4 nights\nper week. We analyzed nights for which there is data from\nboth the infrared camera and the radio device, excluding\nnights shorter than two hours. In total, we analyzed 364\nnights of data, 2721 hours, and 21,619 scratching bouts\n(i.e., scratching events). To our knowledge, this constitutes\nthe largest scratching dataset with ground truth labels."}, {"title": "2.2 Performance of Nocturnal Scratching Detection", "content": "To evaluate the performance on scratching detection,\nwe consider two settings. First, it has been customary\nin the literature to focus on scratching events (continu-\nous scratching movements) lasting 3 seconds or longer\n[26, 27, 29, 30, 31], as such longer events are considered\nmore indicative of disease severity. Taking a similar ap-\nproach, we filtered the ground truth data and the model\npredictions to exclude scratching events shorter than 3 sec-\nonds. Then, for each time instance (time is sampled at 15\nHz), we compare the model's prediction with the ground\ntruth data from video recordings. The results demonstrate\nthat the model offers high performance:\n\u2022 The scratching time per hour (STH), i.e., the\namount of nocturnal scratching divided by the\nlength of the night in hours, displays a strong\ncorrelation between the model's output and the\nground truth (R = 0.97, p < 0.001). This\nanalysis uses the repeated measures correlation\n(rmcorr) [59] to account for differences in the\nnumbers of nights from different participants.\n\u2022 Similarly, rmcorr showed that the scratching\nbouts per hour (SBH), i.e., the number of noc-\nturnal scratching events divided by the length of\nthe night in hours, exhibits a strong correlation\nbetween the model and the ground truth (R = 0.92,\np < 0.001).\n\u2022 The ROC curve analysis shows that the model de-\nlivers an AUC of 0.997, and achieves a specificity\nof 0.997 (95% confidence interval (CI) [0.997,\n0.997]), and sensitivity of 0.825 (95% CI [0.824,\n0.826]).\n\u2022 The Precision-Recall AUC is 0.876, and the\nmodel operates at a precision of 0.766 (95% CI\n[0.765, 0.767]), a recall of 0.825, and F1-score of\n0.795.\nNext, we expanded the scope to consider all scratching\nevents including those lasting less than 3 seconds. Natu-\nrally, it is harder to detect shorter events, yet the model\ncontinues to deliver high performance with statistical sig-\nnificance, as shown Specifically, both\nthe scratching time per hour and the scratching bouts per\nhour are strongly correlated between the model's output\nand the ground truth (R = 0.96, p < 0.001 for STH, and R\n= 0.85, p < 0.001 for SBH). The ROC AUC is 0.995 and\nthe specificity is 0.995 and the sensitivity is 0.806. The\nPrecision-Recall AUC is 0.842, and the model operates\nat a precision of 0.707, a recall of 0.806, and F1-score of\n0.753.\nThese findings collectively affirm the AI model's capacity\nto identify scratching instances, irrespective of whether\nthe focus is on extended scratching bouts (longer than\n3 seconds) or all-encompassing scratching events. For\nthe rest of the results in the paper, we will consider all\nscratching events."}, {"title": "2.3 Performance on Scratching Assessment for N=1", "content": "While our earlier results focus on cohort perfor-\nmance-crucial for clinical trials we subsequently\nshifted our attention to individual-level (n=1) performance.\nThis granular analysis is vital in clinical care, enabling the\nphysician to track the disease burden and the medication\nresponse in a particular patient.\nTo delve deeper into this aspect, we plotted the data for\neach participant separately The radio-based STH\npredictions (displayed on the y-axis) were compared with\nthe ground truth video-based annotations of STH (shown\non the x-axis), spanning all recorded nights. For clarity,\nparticipants were grouped and organized into quartiles,\naccording to the severity of their scratching (measured\nby peak STH), descending from the highest to the lowest.\nAdditionally, various chronic pruritus diagnoses were de-\npicted using distinct colors: atopic dermatitis (AD) in red,\nprurigo nodularis (PN) in green, and chronic pruritus of\nunknown origin (CPUO) in blue.\nThe correlation between the model's predictions and the\nground truth assessments of scratching continues to be\nsignificant, even on a per-participant basis. Pearson's cor-\nrelation ranged from 0.71 to 0.99 across different partici-\npants, with a p-value less than 0.003 consistently across\nthe board."}, {"title": "2.4 Relationship between Scratching and Sleep", "content": "It is widely appreciated that severe itch negatively impacts\nsleep and quality of life [60, 61]. However, an inherent\nparadox in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures is\nthat sleep is an unconscious state, but PRO assessments\nattempt to infer sleep quality via recall in the conscious\nstate. The radio device is uniquely well-suited to address\nthis gap and deliver an objective assessment of the rela-\ntionship between itch and sleep. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that the radio device used in this study deliv-\ners high quality data with regard to sleep efficiency, latency,\nand wakefulness [57]. Further, it accurately detects var-\nious stages of sleep \u2013 wake, light sleep, REM, and deep\nsleep - and performs these measurements at home [56].\nThis presents an opportunity to concurrently measure and\ncorrelate scratching and sleep.\nWe thus used the same wireless signals collected by the\ndevice to infer both sleep quality (using the model by\nZhao et al [56]) and scratching (using the model developed\nherein). Three key sleep metrics were evaluated: a) sleep\ndisturbance, which is defined as one minus sleep efficiency,\nwhere sleep efficiency is the percentage of time the person\nis asleep out of the total time the person is in bed trying to\nfall asleep, b) sleep latency, which is the time spent awake\nbefore sleep onset, and c) wakefulness after sleep onset\n(WASO), which is the amount of awake time after falling\nasleep. The correlation between these sleep metrics and\nscratching was computed using rmcorr, and the analysis\nwas performed in log scale since the log-normal distribu-\ntion provided a closer fit to the data. Nights for which the\nlogarithmic scale is undefined were excluded. The results\nshowed that sleep disturbance, sleep latency, and WASO\nwere all significantly correlated with scratching (fig. 4).\nOverall, the more a participant scratched in a particular\nnight, the higher their sleep disturbance (fig. 4a; R = 0.60,\np < 0.001), the longer their sleep latency (fig. 4b; R =\n0.68, p < 0.001), and the more awake time they had at\nnight (fig. 4c; R = 0.60, p < 0.001). Taken together, these\nfindings indicate that scratching imposes a high burden on\nsleep quality."}, {"title": "2.5 Objective Scratching vs. Subjective Itching", "content": "We next correlated nocturnal scratching measurements\nfrom the infrared camera and the radio device (AI) with\nthe NRS itch score reported by the patients at bedtime (342\nscores from 20 participants). We used a linear mixed-effect\nmodel (where the observed variable is log-transformed due\nto its log-normal distribution). Across the population, we\nfound significant but weak correlation between the subjec-\ntive NRS itch score and objective video-based (R = 0.22,\np < 0.001) and radio-based measurements (R = 0.22, p <\n0.001) Such weak correlation is consis-\ntent with prior reports [8]. Further, the weak relationship\nbetween objective ground-truth scratching from videos and\npatients' self-reporting of the severity of their condition\nhighlights the limitation of current assessment methods.\nWe then hypothesized that, the change in objective scratch-\ning behavior and NRS itch score during treatment and\nresolution of itch may demonstrate better concordance.\nWe followed one participant with Atopic Dermatitis as\nthey underwent treatment with Dupilumab, a monoclonal\nantibody that has reported broad anti-itch properties across\nAD, PN, and CPUO [25, 24, 23]. The participant received\nthe first dose of Dupilumab (300 mg) immediately before\nthe beginning of the monitoring period. We compared\nthe participant's STH, SBH, and NRS measurements two\nweeks before and after the administration of the second\ndose of Dupilumab. Indeed, there were significant reduc-\ntions in both STH and SBH. Similarly, there is also a significant reduction in self-\nreported NRS itch score. These results\nsuggest that both the device and NRS have utility and over-\nall concordance during treatment. However, even in this\ncase, NRS can suffer from a placebo effect. For example,\nafter receiving treatment, the patient immediately reduced\ntheir reported NRS to 0, yet the video recordings showed\nthat the change in scratching is more gradual. Similarly,\nthe reduction in scratching reported by the radio device\nwas gradual and consistent with the video recordings."}, {"title": "3 Discussion", "content": "Itch is defined as an unpleasant sensation that elicits the\ndesire or reflex to scratch.

Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are beginning to change this narrative. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of different AI and ML tools that can be used to streamline and accelerate the drug discovery process. By using data sets to train ML algorithms, it is possible to discover drugs or drug-\nlike compounds relatively quickly, and efficiently. Additionally, we address limitations in AI-based drug discovery and development, including the scarcity of high-quality data to train AI models and ethical considerations. The growing impact of AI on the pharmaceutical industry is also highlighted. Finally, we discuss how AI and ML can expedite the discovery of new antibiotics to combat the problem of worldwide antimicrobial resistance (AMR).", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Traditional drug discovery processes are typically associated with challenges such as high costs, and extended timelines to approval. On average, bringing a new drug to the approval stage using traditional drug-discovery approaches takes nearly a decade of rigorous in vitro, in vivo assays, and clinical trials, costing nearly $3 billion per drug (DiMasi et al., 2016). This lengthy and costly processes is also riddled with failures as many potential drugs fail at different stages of the clinical trials, further complicating the process and cost of drug development.\nMachine Learning (ML), a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has emerged as a promising tool in drug discovery as it can counter the challenges faced in traditional drug-discovery processes (Dara et al., 2022; Stokes et al., 2020). ML is used to create algorithms after training from large and vast datasets to make predictions. In drug discovery, ML scans through biological data to identify patterns that are likely missed by humans. ML models can be used to predict activity and potential side effects of hit (or lead) compounds and can suggest new scaffolds with promising properties (Vamathevan et al., 2019)."}, {"title": null, "content": "The use of computational tools in drug discovery is not new. However, ML has significantly enhanced the capacity of Computer-Aided Drug Discovery (CADD). In the past, researchers heavily relied on the Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models to improve upon the potency of a 'hit' or a 'lead' compound. QSAR, which uses statistical methods to predict compound activity based on molecular structure, are powerful but can be too simplistic to capture intricate relationships needed for accurate predictions (Lavecchia, 2015), and therefore, QSAR does not work for all potential therapeutics.\nDeep Learning (DL), a subset of ML, that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers is proving to be a powerful tool in drug discovery. DL models can automatically identify relevant features from the raw data. Thus, DL models are extremely useful for analyzing molecular structures and predicting interaction of a new drug(s) with the target proteins (Zhavoronkov et al., 2019). Multiple factors such as improvements in computational power, availability of large datasets, and the creation of new algorithms have strengthened DL tools. For example, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become increasingly popular for analyzing molecular structures and predicting the affinity of a drug with its target (Gawehn et al., 2016). Similarly, the generative models can be used to design entirely new molecules with desired properties, transforming the landscape of drug discovery (Segler et al., 2018; B. Zhang et al., 2023).\nThis review is divided into the following sections. First, we explore the evolution of ML techniques (Section 2) followed by a focus on emerging models and techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformer models within the context of drug design and application of AI to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (Section 3). While addressing the application of AI in drug discovery associated in AMR, we discuss global economical and clinical issues. Of note, AMR is a serious global public health problem, which threatens treatments of a variety of infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-typhoidal Salmonella and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Sakagianni et al., 2023). ML methods have been developed to analyze bacterial genomes, recognize epidemic patterns, forecast susceptibility to medication,"}, {"title": "2. Evolution of Machine Learning Techniques in Drug Discovery", "content": "2.1. Traditional Algorithms to Advanced Deep Learning.\nAI-based drug discovery has evolved significantly. Initially, traditional algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) dominated the field as they were instrumental in the early stages of ML application, particularly in tasks like QSAR modeling. QSAR modeling helped predict the biological activity of chemical compounds based on their molecular structure. SVMs, on the other hand, excelled in classifying compounds by drawing optimal boundaries between different classes in high- dimensional spaces (Jaganathan et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2017). RF models provided robustness through its ensemble learning approach in which multiple decision trees were combined to improve prediction accuracy while also reducing the risk of overfitting (Cort\u00e9s-Ciriano, 2015; Coudray et al., 2018)."}, {"title": "1.a.1 Limitations of Traditional Algorithms.", "content": "While traditional ML algorithms were successful initially, the complexity and volume of biological data exposed the limitations of traditional ML algorithms.

RF models were more robust in conditions of overfitting and provided"}, {"title": "1.1.2. Evolution of Deep Learning.", "content": "The introduction of DL marked a critical point in the use of ML in drug discovery as DL models such as CNNs and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) outperformed traditional ML algorithms, primarily due to their ability to automatically extract salient features from the data sets without the requirement of manually extracting the features for use as in traditional AI algorithms (Jimenez et al., 2018; Zhavoronkov et al., 2019). CNNs, which were originally designed for image recognition tasks proved to be useful in analyzing molecular structures as well as predicting protein-ligand interactions. CNNs were able to offer higher accuracy due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data (Gupta et al., 2021). RNNs, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were initially created to handle sequence prediction tasks like predicting the effects of drug interactions over a period of time, making them extremely useful in comprehending temporal dynamics in biological systems (Choudhury et al., 2022).\nWith the evolution of ML models, the datasets used to train and accompany these models have also expanded. Datasets used in the most recent drug discovery ML models are shown below in Table 1."}, {"title": "1.1.3. Generative models and drug design.", "content": "Looking at past DL models, generative models have also emerged as powerful tools in drug design because these models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have the unique ability to generate new data instances like novel chemical structures that could likely serve as drug candidates (Chaudhari et al., 2020; Madeira et al., 2019). GANs, for example, consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which leads to the creation of highly realistic synthetic data that can simulate the drug discovery process. This approach has been especially useful when"}, {"title": "2. Machine Learning Techniques in Drug Discovery and Application to AMR", "content": "2.1. Reinforcement Learning for Drug Development.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is a ML technique that learns from doing. Each action such as adding an atom or bond to a molecule earns a reward or penalty and helps the model to learn choices leading to the best outcomes. This is particularly useful in drug design where one tries to find the optimal structure for a molecule that would likely provide desired biological activity (Popova et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). When it comes to targeting multiple factors (e.g. proteins) at once for drug design, RL is particularly powerful, which makes it critical for treating complex diseases like cancer. For instance, the MTMol-GPT model uses RL to generate molecules that are precisely tailored to effectively target and engage multiple molecules (Agyemang et al., 2021; Ho and Ermon, 2016). However, RL does come with its own challenges, like defining the right reward parameters (e.g., potency, selectively, and safety) and managing the high computational costs. These reward functions need to be carefully fine-tuned so that the model focuses on the right balance of characteristics instead of becoming fixated on certain aspects. Another challenge is the sheer computational power needed for RL. Exploring the vast space of possible molecular structures and training the models that are useful requires significant processing power, which can be a major roadblock for many researchers (Popova et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019). Importantly, with the ongoing advances in algorithms and technology, RL is expected to play a larger role in the future of drug design processes (Popova et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "2.2.

These models treat molecular structures as sentences by breaking them into sequences [similar to SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings] and then using advanced language processing techniques to analyze them. This approach is particularly powerful when it comes to designing new drugs from scratch because transformers can generate entirely new molecular structures that meet specific design criteria (Vaswani et al., 2017(Popova et al., 2018).\nA critical component of transformer models is their ability to deal with complex relationships in a molecule, even when the atoms are far apart from each other. This makes transformer models extremely useful at modeling large, intricate molecules that are common in drug discovery. However, transformer"}, {"title": "2.4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).", "content": "Due to its ability to model complex relationships within molecules, GNNs have quickly become a necessary tool in drug discovery and are the newest representatives of ML techniques for drug discovery. GNNs work by imagining each atom as a point (or node) and each bond as a line (or edge) that connects these points and using this structure to understand how a molecule's parts interact with each other. This, in turn, helps predict how a drug will behave in the body. Unlike older models that relied on fixed rules, GNNs learn directly from these molecular graphs which make them much better at capturing the unique characteristics between different molecules (Hamilton, 2020; Wang et. al, 2023).\nGNNs' ability to combine information makes them extremely unique. For example, when a GNN analyzes a molecule, it starts by looking at each atom and its immediate connections. From that, it then updates this information layer by layer until it finally builds a complete picture of the molecule. This layered approach helps the model understand the small details along with the bigger picture which helps create more accurate predictions, regardless of whether trying to understand how a drug binds to a protein or how it might be metabolized (Kovacs et al., 2019; Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, 2018).\nAnother useful feature of GNNs is its ability to use attention mechanisms which allows the model to focus on the parts of the molecule that are most relevant to a given task like identifying a potential binding site for a drug. This is especially useful when dealing with complex or unusual molecules where some parts of the structure might be more important than others (Sanchez-Martin et. al. 2024; Yao et al., 2024)).\nCompared to an older model, GNNs offer a better dynamic and flexible way to model molecules, which is extremely important for identifying new drug candidates (Kipf and Welling, 2016; Liu et al., 2020)."}, {"title": "2.5. AI-Assisted Molecular Docking", "content": "There are many open source and commercial docking programs that are used for the docking of small molecules into the target proteins. The widely used open-source programs are AutoDock (Goodsell and Olson, 1990), AutoDock Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010), and SMINA (a fork of AutoDock Vina) (Koes et al., 2013).\nAI-assisted docking is a significant development in the drug discovery process as it improves upon traditional docking methods such as AutoDock and GLIDE. While traditional docking remains an invaluable methodology, it is computationally expensive and time-consuming process due to its reliance on physical simulations and scoring functions. AI-assisted docking can improve upon this process by training models on large datasets of known protein-ligand complexes that allow better predict binding outcomes in a short timeframe (Gainza et al., 2020).\nSince AI-assisted docking depends on learning from the large datasets of known protein-ligand complexes, ML models such as GNN can predict the most likely binding poses and affinities. AI-assisted docking is especially useful when screening large libraries of compounds against a given target protein as it significantly speeds up the early stages of drug discovery (Gligorijevic et al., 2021; Jumper et al., 2021).\nAl models add additional layers of information such as molecular dynamics with docking, which can provide more detailed information on the flexibility of molecules over a period of time. This, in turn, improves docking predictions and makes them more robust. An example of this involves the highly accurate prediction of binding affinities as even difficult targets like protein-protein interactions or highly flexible binding sites to a high degree of accuracy because of AI techniques. While these AI-driven approaches save time, they also pave the way for new processes to discover drugs that might have otherwise been overlooked (Gainza et al., 2020) Wallach et al., 2023)."}, {"title": null, "content": "Newer and faster AI-based molecular docking programs are continuously emerging. For example, GNINA (McNutt et al., 2021) utilizes an ensemble of CNNs as a scoring function outperforms AutoDock Vina scoring on redocking and cross-docking tasks when the binding pocket is defined. Other ML based docking programs include DiffSBDD, developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and now adopted by NVIDIA, uses a three 3D equivariant GNN that has three layers: embedding, interaction layer with 6 graph convolution layers, and output layer (Schneuing et. al, 2022). Additional examples of AI-based molecular docking programs are EquiBind (Li et al., 2023), TankBind (Lu et. al, 2024), and PoseBusters (Buttenschoen et al., 2024). An advantage of these molecular docking programs is that they are available through open-source licenses as opposed to commercial docking programs such as Glide from Schr\u00f6dinger Inc. (Bhachoo and Beuming, 2017; Friesner et al., 2004; Morris et al., 2009) and GOLD (Verdonk et al., 2003).\nA list of opensource molecular docking programs can be found at https://biochemia.uwm.edu.pl/en/docking-2/. The efficiency of opensource docking programs can be enhanced by combining the opensource binding site prediction programs such as P2Rank (Krivak and Hoksza, 2018), AutoSite (Ravindranath and Sanner, 2016) and AutoLigand (Harris et al., 2008) among others."}, {"title": "2.6. QSAR Methods for Antimicrobial Activity.", "content": "With the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistant pathogens that outpace traditional drug discovery methods QSAR could offer a potential solution.. For this purpose, ML has become important, especially through the use of QSAR modeling. With this technique, researchers can predict the efficacy of potential antimicrobial compounds by analyzing the relationship between their molecular structure and biological activity."}, {"title": "1.a.1 QSAR Modeling in Antimicrobial Discovery.", "content": "QSAR is an important technique to discover new antimicrobials. QSAR functions by examining the structural properties of chemical compounds such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity, and electronic characteristics. QSAR will then correlate these properties with the biological activity of the compounds. By using QSAR models, researchers have been able to predict which new compounds possess better efficacy and show effective antimicrobial activity, thereby potentially reducing the time and cost associated with traditional drug discovery (Bento et al., 2014).\nA notable use of QSAR modeling to fight against multidrug resistant bacteria comes from the work of Bento and colleagues in 2015 as they focused on using QSAR models to screen and predict antimicrobial activity for a wide array of chemical compounds. By delving deep into the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of existing antibiotics, they were able to identify patterns and molecular characteristics that shared a correlation to strong antimicrobial properties. They did so by attaching QSAR models to a large dataset of antibiotic compounds in order to thoroughly analyze how specific molecular features influenced the compounds' ability to combat resistant bacteria. Their models did not simply identify potential candidates from pre-existing molecules, rather, they were able to successfully predict several novel compounds that subsequently exhibited promising antimicrobial activities. These compounds were then experimented on further for validation which highlights how computational models can complement traditional methods to accelerate the drug discovery process while also reducing costs and resource use (Bento et al., 2014).\nOne issue with QSAR modeling in antimicrobial activity is its reliance on the availability of high quality, experimental data. QSAR models require extensive datasets of chemical structures as well as their corresponding biological activities to accurately predict the antimicrobial potential of new compounds. If the data used is incomplete, biased, or not representative of the full chemical space, the model could become overfitted and lack generalizability which will make it less reliable when introduced to new data (Cherkasov et al., 2014)."}, {"title": "2.6.2. Integration of QSAR with Advanced ML Algorithms.", "content": "The integration of advanced ML models with QSAR modeling has shown to improve the prediction of antimicrobial activity. The ML-infused QSAR models can capture the intricate as well as non-linear relationships between chemical structures and their biological activities against pathogens. For instance, DL algorithms such as neural networks are especially good at handling complexities in antimicrobial drug discovery since they learn from extensive datasets to identify subtle patterns and correlations that traditional QSAR methods may miss. This is especially true in the situations where the chemical structures are unconventional or where the biological data is heterogenous or incomplete (Bento et al., 2014; Cherkasov et al., 2014)).\nWhen applying ML-enhanced QSAR to antimicrobial activity, models can more accurately predict the efficacy of novel compounds against resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Koh et al., 2023). Additionally, these models can quickly identify off-target binding of novel compounds causing toxicities. ML tools contribute heavily to improving the predictive power of QSAR models which therefore allows it to quicker and more efficiently create new antimicrobial agents (F. Zhang et al., 2023)."}, {"title": "2.7. The Use of ML in Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction.", "content": "The early identification and prediction of AMR can help avoid its economical and clinical drawbacks. Thus, genome-based ML can be applied to AMR prediction, using a data- driven approach rather than a rule-based prediction (Benefo et al., 2024). For example, genomic information on isolates associated to the specific disease can be combined with data on these isolates' AMR phenotypes to different antibiotics. Commonly, these include amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, sulfisoxazole, streptomycin, tetracycline, and cefoxitin (Benefo et al., 2024)."}, {"title": null, "content": "The best algorithms for genome-based prediction of AMR are RF, Cost-Sensitive Learning, SVM, Radial Bias Function Kernel, Neural Network, and Logit Boost. These algorithms are trained on data specific to the disease and can be evaluated for the model fit based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and confusion matrix statistics. For each antimicrobial, the model can predict the AMR phenotypes of the set of isolates, which can be compared to ResFinder AMR phenotype predictions to test accuracy (Benefo et al., 2024; Florensa et al., 2022).\nFinally, AI assists Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which can test the association between genetic variants and corresponding AMR phenotypes to find new resistance determinants. The results of GWAS are broad ranging, as they can gain insight into a phenotype's underlying biology, predict a phenotype's heritability, calculate genetic correlations, and more (Uffelmann et al., 2021). Crucially, GWAS can inform drug development programs to develop more effective antibiotics.\nSpecifically, ML models can use Genome Scale Models (GEMs) for high-performance classifying of AMR phenotypes of disease strains. GEMs can directly use GEMs as an input-output ML model to extract insights from GWAS datasets (Kavvas et al., 2020). Although traditionally using GWAS can have reduced prediction accuracy, the integration of ML can increase these rates."}, {"title": "3.

Notable Pharmaceutical Collaborations.", "content": "One example of this collaboration is when AstraZeneca joined forces with a company called BenevolentAI. This collaboration is focused on using AI to accelerate the drug discovery process by finding new therapeutic targets. Benevolent Al's platform brings ML together with enormous amounts of biomedical data to identify new drug candidates for complex diseases. This deal epitomizes the potential for AI to enhance traditional drug discovery processes and really accelerate the development of new therapies. AstraZeneca and BenevolentAI's collaboration is particularly notable for its focus on using AI to address areas of high unmet medical need, such as neurodegenerative diseases and autoimmune disorders (Brown et. al, 2018).\nAnother notable collaboration is between Pfizer and IBM Watson. The latter's AI capabilities were expected to be used in the partnership in analyzing huge datasets to identify prospective drug candidates. The AI platform of IBM Watson supported decision-making in clinical trials and helped increase the efficiency and accuracy of the design and execution of trials. This clearly showed how AI, while traditionally used in early stages of drug discovery, can also be used in optimizing later stages of drug development. Integrating AI into the clinical trial process has enabled Pfizer to structure the development of new drugs much better and bring drugs to the market at speeds that were previously impossible (Eyre et al., 2021).\nThe collaboration between Novartis and Microsoft is another success story in AI-driven drug discovery. Novartis harnessed the power of Microsoft's AI platform to accelerate the design of new drugs by analyzing heaps of biological data. This partnership was oriented toward the application of AI in developing new treatments against conditions with high unmet medical needs, like cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Oftentimes with real data, scientists face issues such as poor-quality data, under-fitting of models, and barriers to data access, highlighting the importance of AI- generated synthetic data (Peters et al., 2020). Thus, synthetic data allows researchers to simulate different biological scenarios for therapeutic purposes without facing these challenges (Pun et al., 2023).\nModels to generate synthetic data primarily feature GANs, which projects features onto an image space that the discriminator subsequently operates on, leading to Visual Domain Adaptation. In one case study, Microsoft researchers used ML systems based on a 3D face model and an asset library to generate synthetic data and found it had comparable accuracy to real data and detected faces in unconstrained settings (Lu et al., 2024). Aside from GANs, systems focusing on de novo drug molecular design have also used VAES, energy-based models, diffusion models, reinforcement learning, and more (Lu et al., 2024).\nImportantly, because it can augment or replace real data, synthetic data is also re-used to train ML models that again create synthetic cohorts.

Fortunately, synthetic data can lead to more comprehensive and unbiased analyses by filling in data for these underrepresented groups (Chawla, 2002).\nUnfortunately, there are limitations to using synthetic data that have yet to be addressed. Firstly, AI models cannot generate synthetic data with complexities that the model is not aware of, showing problems with cyclical training (Achuthan et al., 2022). Additionally, relying too much on synthetic data for underrepresented populations raises ethical concerns by completely forgoing relevant, real-world data (Howe and Elenberg, 2020).

In technical terms, this entire process is known as target identification and is a crucial step of drug discovery. Challenges to traditional target identification are vast and include insufficient coverage of the patient population, lack of alternative responses to drug resistance, and the limited presence of \u201cdruggable\" targets (You et al., 2022).

By integrating data from different omics layers, researchers can identify correlations as well as causal relationships that might be missed when examining each data type separately. For example, the combination of genomic data (which provides insights into genetic predispositions) with proteomic data (which reveals protein expression levels) can help identify novel drug targets and understand disease mechanisms at a deeper level (Choudhury et al., 2022).\nMany case studies show the successful integration of multi- omics into drug discovery. One instance is the successful integration of multi-omics in cancer research, in which multi-omics data was used to identify biomarkers for early detection in an attempt to develop personalized therapies. In one study, integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data allowed researchers to predict patient responses to chemotherapy more accurately, allowing for more tailored treatment plans to be developed (Arora et al., 2021; Dara et al., 2022). Another example can be seen in the battle against drug resistance. By combining metabolomic and proteomic data, researchers have uncovered new ways that cancer cells react to chemotherapy to survive. Due to multi-omics however, strategies are now being developed to counteract this resistance and hopefully create more effective cancer therapies (Gupta et al., 2021).\nBased on the importance of multi-omics data to drug discovery, AI should be used as a complementary and enhancement tool.

These predictive models are especially important as they identify a patient's risk to a disease before the condition develops, allowing time for early care (Pammi et al., 2023).\nAnother example is the Explainable Multi-Omics Graph Integration algorithm, which is a GNN algorithm that analyzed multi-omics pan-cancer data and identified 156 novel oncogenes that had the potential to become cancer targets (Guan and Wang, 2024). For overall central nervous system diseases, AI/ML tools were also powerful in identifying therapeutic targets after analyzing multi-omics data and ML (RF, SVM, and Decision Tree) classifiers predicted disease- associated genes using multi-omics data (Vatansever et al., 2021). Based on these previous studies, AI should further integrate with multi-omics data for different phases of drug discovery.\nWhile integrating multi-omics data with drug discovery comes with many benefits, there are still many factors that need to be addressed for it to be fully utilized. One of the biggest issues is the size and complexity of the data that is being handled by the AI models (Elbadawi et al., 2021). It has also proven tricky to standardize data across different -omics platforms since each platform uses different techniques to gather their data. Due to this, a lot of variability happens between the data which makes it more difficult to handle and manage effectively both traditionally and with AI. To fix these shortcomings in the future, it is important that features be added to interpret the data and better ML models be created in order to take full advantage of multi-omics (Prasad and Kumar, 2021).\nHigh-throughput technologies have generated an unprecedented amount and complexity of multi- omics data in the current scenario. AI/ML is a promising avenue for tapping the full potential of multi- omics data for drug discovery, as it can enhance the overall process.

This exemplifies the pace at which this process has been carried out and, by implication, the potential for AI to really transform the process of drug discovery. By drastically reducing the number of molecules that need to be prepared in the lab and subsequently tested, AI facilitates a much more focused and efficient approach toward drug development."}, {"title": null, "content": "Furthermore, a drug lead discovery AI platform by Exscientia has successfully identified a novel CDK7 inhibitor that progressed into clinical studies. This was possible because AI can optimize the lead compounds through iterative cycles of prediction and validation quickly. Such an approach, according to Exscientia, could reduce the time taken for drug development to less than two years from target identification to clinical trials (Mullard, 2024)."}, {"title": "1."}]}

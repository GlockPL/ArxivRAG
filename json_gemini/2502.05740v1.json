In this paper, we investigate how recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) can benefit remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems through clinical integration by designing RECOVER, an LLM-powered RPM system for postoperative GI cancer care. To closely engage stakeholders in the design process, we first conducted seven participatory design sessions with five clinical staff and interviewed five cancer patients to derive six major design strategies for integrating clinical guidelines and information needs into LLM-based RPM systems. We then designed and implemented RECOVER, which features an LLM-powered conversational agent for cancer patients and an interactive dashboard for clinical staff to enable efficient postoperative RPM. Finally, we used RECOVER as a pilot system to assess the implementation of our design strategies with four clinical staff and five patients, providing design implications by identifying crucial design elements, offering insights on responsible AI, and outlining opportunities for future LLM-powered RPM systems.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer refers to malignancies affecting the digestive tract (e.g. stomach, liver, esophagus), accounting for more than 35% of all cancer-related deaths. Although surgical removal of affected organs or tissues is a primary and effective treatment, postoperative GI cancer survivors remain at high risk of life-threatening complications, such as sepsis and surgical leakage [13, 27]. Given the unpredictability of postoperative complications due to varying patient recovery trajectories [93], close patient monitoring is crucial for early detection and timely intervention to prevent medical emergencies, hospital readmissions, and fatalities [16, 82].\nTraditional in-person hospital visits for postoperative follow-up stack scheduling delays, transportation burdens, and infection risks to GI cancer survivors; thus, the remote patient monitoring (RPM) paradigm has become particularly valuable by enabling monitoring of patients' health situation at home [63]. Yet commonly adopted RPM methods are not clinically compliant for postoperative GI cancer care. Although phone calls by nurse practitioners or tele-questionnaires offer guidelines for patients to report symptoms [63, 84], they either require high clinical dedication or brings confusion and burden to patients such as the \u201csurvey fatigue\" [55, 57, 78, 78]. Despite the flexibility and convenience of mHealth platforms, patient messages through patient portals leads to fragmentation and disruption of clinical staff's busy workflow [55, 78]; design and usability issues of clinical user interfaces have made it difficult to navigate patient data, extract actionable insights, and make clinical decisions [108]. These limitations, thus, hinder timely decisions and interventions, and increase clinician burnout [16, 103]. There is an urgent need for innovative RPM solutions that align with providers' clinical workflows and information needs to improve healthcare outcomes and enhance efficiency.\nRecent advances in ubiquitous computing technologies and large language models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities in collecting patient health information in rich multimodal formats and supporting clinical work."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Here we first review in Section 2.1 the challenges GI cancer providers face monitoring patients' postoperative recovery and traditional RPM practices. Second, in Section 2.2, we discuss recent advancements and limitations of ubiquitous health technologies for RPM, some of which powered by LLMs, and the need for clinical integration in postoperative cancer care. Lastly, we review recent advancements in LLMs that may potentially support the RPM work of staff in our domain-specific clinical context in Section 2.3."}, {"title": "2.1 Postoperative Gl Cancer Care Challenges and Practices", "content": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer causes around 3.4 million deaths per year worldwide, and the 5-year survival rates are below 30% in many cases after their surgery [7, 66, 99]. Monitoring postoperative GI cancer patients is challenging for healthcare providers due to the wide range of potential health issues patients may face. Severe complications such as anastomotic leakage and sepsis [93, 105] are common, while changes in the GI system can further disrupt patients' nutritional status and quality of life (QOL), potentially impacting their long-term survival [17, 34, 105]. Research work in surgical oncology has investigated preoperative factors such as lifestyle data to identify high-risk patients [93]. However, many of the postoperative complications remain urgent and unpredictable [66, 93].\nAfter the postoperative cancer patients are discharged for their recovery at home, close monitoring of patient health conditions helps address these unpredictable conditions through early interventions [28]. Following clinical guidelines [88], cancer care institutions have adopted remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems to monitor certain aspects of a patient's health from their own home but also learned their limitations [63]. Traditional RPM methods such as phone calls, patient portals, or rigorous questionnaires could save time and travel efforts for both patients and providers [63]. Yet the questionnaires are frequently lengthy and complex, leading to patients \u201csurvey fatigue\u201d, which significantly diminishes the quality and quantity of information gathered [57, 84]. Alternative methods, such as secure messaging or phone calls, are typically one-way (from patients to providers) and often lack clear instructions [20] to the patients who have limited health literacy [16]. Consequently, cancer care providers continue to face a shortage of essential information for effective interventions and decision-making [103].\nAdditionally, Le\u00f3n et al. [55] pointed out issues in telehealth systems for clinical staff including nurses and specialists, including (1) additional workload such as documentation efforts, (2) disruption to the workflow, and (3) false alarms and unclear data. In other cases, redundant information causes cancer care providers' information overload beyond their clinical duties, and thus necessary interventions could be delayed [11, 25, 103]. The limitations in traditional patient monitoring methods in postoperative GI cancer care call for more efficient, user-friendly technology for RPM while ensuring clinical adherence. Recent research by Yang et al. [103] summarized some key information that cancer providers look for in their RPM practices, but how we might design such novel technology remains under-explored."}, {"title": "2.2 Ubiquitous Systems for Remote Patient Monitoring in Cancer Care", "content": "Recent advancements in ubiquitous systems have significantly advanced the collection of patient health information. Mobile health (mHealth) applications, sensors, wearable systems, and personal coaches have been used to track patient stress levels and daily activities [38, 46, 50, 79]. In particular, some research in clinical settings has designed and tested mHealth apps that effectively integrate questionnaires or wearable devices to track patients' activities and postoperative conditions [37, 82]. However, these solutions, mostly collecting structured and quantitative data, still fall short in guiding patients to report descriptive domain-specific symptoms, and lack flexibility and adaptivity regarding the various postoperative conditions of postoperative GI cancer patients (e.g. feeling of pain or nausea) [103]. The provider interfaces also mostly present unprocessed raw data, further overloading busy healthcare providers [82, 103]. Realizing these limitations, a recent co-design study with patients"}, {"title": "2.3 Large Language Models for Clinical Work in Patient Care", "content": "The recent technological boost of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT [75], offers a promising opportunity for system designers to picture a more clinically compliant solution with LLMs' great potential in engaging in and scaffolding natural clinical conversations [45, 83, 100, 101, 107]. Researchers have explored LLM-powered CAs for remotely collecting patient health data in areas such as public health interventions, chronic disease management, and pre-consultation screening [31, 41, 57, 67, 70, 96]. For instance, a multi-modal CA by Chira et al. [23] collects health data from patients with brain diseases by asking general check-in questions such as \u201chow are you doing today\". However, most of the LLM CAs focus on patient experiences or data collection, overlooking the information needs of clinical staff, especially in high-risk cases like postoperative GI cancer care. Yet, good clinical adherence could benefit intervention or decision-making in domain-specific conditions. Recently, an LLM CA leverages QA datasets and wearable sensor data to help explain health monitoring data to patients (e.g. glucose from wearable sensors) [32], revealing great potential for LLM-powered telehealth systems to integrate clinical guidelines and symptom-related information needs. As LLM CAs continue to proliferate, we investigate their potential in critical clinical settings for efficient and comprehensive RPM.\nMeanwhile, language models have also shown their outstanding capability in processing medical domain knowledge in clinical practices, especially in pre-trained models like MedPaLM[85], UmlsBERT[65], and BioBERT [53]. For healthcare professionals, researchers have also leveraged LLMs for clinical pre-screening [39, 94], risk prediction [10, 35, 48, 73] and information processing [5, 6, 18, 51, 69, 71]. Specifically related to patient monitoring, LLMs may optimize clinical workflow in basic tasks like scheduling or reviewing information [92]; some work leveraged LLM benchmarks to analyze patient monitoring data [43], or multi-modal LLMs to automate patient health monitoring [44]. Although LLM responses may align with clinical guidelines in general evaluations, they may not directly adhere to domain-specific clinical work, such as those in need of evidence-based recommendations [72]. In 2023, researchers integrated decision trees from medical literature for LLM-supported clinical decision-making [58], but little work has explored how to design LLMs' clinical integration for RPM or similar postoperative scenarios.\nFocusing on the experience of clinical staff, LLM-powered interfaces such as digital dashboards have been designed for providers to process patient conditions in daily healthcare or emergency decision-making [103, 108]. However, these designs may not suit RPM for postoperative GI cancer, where both domain-specific provider instructions, clinical specifications, and timely qualitative data from patients are essential. Some clinical studies suggest using machine learning (ML) models to identify high-risk postoperative GI cancer patients [21, 93], but such models have yet to be tested or deployed in real-world settings. Therefore, we aim to explore how clinical needs and guidelines can be integrated with LLMs to develop an LLM-powered telehealth system for postoperative GI cancer care and similar high-risk scenarios."}, {"title": "3 DESIGNING LLM-POWERED SYSTEM FOR RPM WITH GI CANCER PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Methodology", "content": "We conducted two rounds of studies to gather insights for the design of our system: first, we interviewed GI cancer patients to gather their experiential insights with postoperative care and digital health tools; then, we"}, {"title": "3.1.1 Interview with Cancer Patients", "content": "The research team first disseminated recruitment information via posters and text posts to cancer support groups on social networking sites, which requires prospective participants to complete a screening survey.

With these criteria, we recruited five participants: two with stomach cancer, two with pancreatic cancer, and one with colon cancer.

The term \u201chealthcare providers\u201d also refers to clinical staff and is used for generalization and brevity. We recruited five clinical staff using snowball sampling from two cancer care institutions in the central U.S. (see Table 1 for demographics). All participants work closely with GI cancer patients during surgery and recovery, and most of them have over 20 years of experience in GI cancer care."}, {"title": "3.1.3 PD Session Procedure", "content": "Since RPM involves multiple stakeholders: patients for data collection outside clinical settings, and providers for monitoring and decision-making [89], our system design focuses on three key components: (1) system architecture and information flow, (2) patient interface, and (3) provider interface. We conducted seven participatory design sessions on Zoom, each lasting around 30 minutes. Three to five participants joined each session to discuss different design decisions of the system and create design artifacts like drafts and flowcharts. The sessions were held every one to two weeks over two months, as detailed in Figure 2.\nThroughout these sessions, the research team documented participant inputs through note-taking and design drafts. The recordings of these sessions were transcribed, and two researchers first used inductive coding to code the transcripts and participant comments, then iterated the axial codes until consensus. We identified five major themes on design insights from providers (see Section 3.3).\nDesigning Information Flow with Diagrams Based on Clinical Workflow. The researchers first created a Figma diagram to illustrate the data flow between components. Providers reviewed the system architecture, focusing on how the collected patient health data is stored and managed. As providers assessed the diagrams, they shared how patient data is handled in clinical systems such as EHR and recommended changes to improve patient data safety and privacy."}, {"title": "3.2 Patient Perspectives", "content": "To start with, the patient participants (PP) reported a variety of symptoms and health issues that they experienced, including pain and pain control (4 PPs), GI conditions, fatigue, wound care, breathing, physical activities, and emotional breakdown (PP1, 2, 3, 5). The list of symptoms corresponds to the providers' experience mentioned in 3.3. Meanwhile, the participants felt a lack of knowledge about their cancer surgery and recovery (PP1, 2, 3), and therefore are in great demand of providers' instructions and explanations. For instance, PP3 needed the nurse to explain how and why he needed help managing the digestive system and symptoms, and PP2 double-checked with the doctor about activity and dietary instructions.\nAmong their experience in remote communication, most PPs contact their providers through phone calls, with only one using an online meeting (PP3) and one with a satisfactory telehealth system (PP4). One major challenge for patients was the limited availability of clinical staff, especially as they identified their postoperative recovery phase as needing quick response and instructions when they have symptoms. Three participants expected their providers, especially doctors, to be more responsive in urgent situations (PP1, 2, 5), \u201cwhen patients are in their down moments, they need the doctors to be there 24/7... some things that come up after surgery are actually things that require urgent attention\u201d (PP2).\nBuilt upon their experiences, the participants expected a conversational, responsive, and intelligent system for RPM to support them during the postoperative recovery. Three participants envisioned a conversational agent that answered various questions and offered solutions to their symptoms (PP1, 2, 3): \u201cwhen you have something like a doctor... we can have a conversation.\u201d (PP3). In addition, two participants expected the system to be \u201creadily available\" and offer \u201creal-time replies\" (PP4, 5), while PP3 suggested integrating more personal medical history to offer better responses."}, {"title": "3.3 Design Insights from Cancer Providers", "content": "Probing Key Information based on Clinical Standards and Provider Experience. Participants expressed strong interest in using LLM-powered CAs for collecting patient health data in RPM. Building on prior research, they identified 13 essential questions for the LLM to ask, focusing on key symptoms for postoperative GI cancer patients, such as breathing, pain, drainage, blood, and stool (Table 2). For example, the presence of blood in the stool could indicate surgical complications (P4). Providers refined the wording of these questions to ensure comprehensive coverage during patient interactions and assigned severity levels (\u201cmost severe\u201d, \u201cmoderate\u201d, \"least severe\"), determined if a 10-point Likert scale should be used and suggested color for each question."}, {"title": "3.4 Design Strategies", "content": "We note our patient and provider participants have different focuses for design expectations towards LLM-powered systems for RPM.

With these elements, LLMs can effectively incorporate domain-specific clinical guidelines and needs into remote patient monitoring systems, thereby providing robust support for clinical workflows.\nPrior studies have highlighted the importance of aligning digital health tools with clinical workflows to enhance their adoption and efficacy [64, 87], with some exploration of clinical integration only on decision-support or documentation systems [22, 80]. Our RECOVER system, extending the RPM systems beyond general inquiries, integrates domain-specific clinical information needs to enhance its ability to provide timely and relevant patient monitoring. We picture that such LLM-powered systems may impact the RPM work from the following perspectives.\nLong-term Impact to Patient Care In clinical practice, the integration of LLMs may significantly alter standardized workflows. For example, follow-up phone calls made by nurse practitioners or patient self-reporting may be supplemented with LLM-assisted tools based on (1) the descriptive protocol, then reducing the time and effort required for routine monitoring and data collection with (3) priority mapping framework. This revised work-flow would involve a combination of LLM-supported monitoring and human-led clinical visits, with providers remaining central to decision-making and patient care. Still, in this transformation, designers must carefully evaluate which steps can be simplified and which should remain integral. For instance, face-to-face visits and physical examinations should continue to play a critical role in patient care, ensuring the reliability and safety of high-stakes clinical decisions.\nApart from supporting clinical work in RPM, LLMs may also enhance patient education beyond existing question-answer chatbots [40] with (2) a comprehensive list of key questions. By engaging patients in scaffolded, professionally guided conversations, LLMs could help reinforce awareness of critical symptoms and health conditions during daily monitoring. This approach has the potential to encourage patients to adopt more proactive and informed health management practices. Long-term health monitoring could potentially shift the focus from reactive, short-term responses to sustained, preventative care.\nEngage Clinical Stakeholders when Facing Design Conflicts. As we integrated domain-specific knowledge into our system design, we observed differing perspectives between cancer care providers and HCI researchers and designers. For instance, since there were no written clinical coloring guidelines available, our research team first followed common mental models and design conventions to use the colors red, yellow, and green to indicate the severity of symptoms. Unexpectedly, the provider participants completely disagreed with this design, arguing that"}, {"title": "6.2 Responsible Al Systems for Remote Patient Monitoring", "content": null}, {"title": "6.2.1 Accountability and Responsibility Boundary in Al Responses", "content": "Researchers have outlined principles for responsible AI, emphasizing fairness, explainability, and accountability [8, 29], which in clinical contexts extend to opacity, responsibility, and reliability [86].

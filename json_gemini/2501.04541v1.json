INTRODUCTION", "content": "STEGANOGRAPHY, the art of concealing information\nwithin non-suspicious media, is rooted in the exchange\nof messages, which has always carried with it the timeless\nchallenge of secrecy [1]\u2013[6]. From whispers in shadows to\nthe hidden messages written in the margins of history, hu-\nmankind has long sought ways to convey thoughts that remain\nimperceptible to all but the chosen few. This ancient pursuit\nof covert communication has evolved, stretching across the\nrealms of visual, auditory, and linguistic media [7]\u2013[13]. In the\nintricate patterns of imagery, the subtle modulation of sound\nand the carefully crafted structures of language, steganography\nadvances in various forms, continually adapting to the evolving\nsteganalytic detection mechanisms that seeks to reveal hidden\nmessages [14]\u2013[20].\nThis study embarks on an exploration of a new stegano-\ngraphic paradigm in robotics, the realm where the cyber and\nphysical worlds intersect, expanding the boundaries of what\nis considered a viable channel for covert communication. We\nconsider a form of steganography through the very motions\nof a robotic agent. Robotics is an interdisciplinary study dedi-\ncated to the pursuit of intelligent behaviours that mimic human\nactions [21]. At the heart of this quest lies robotic motion con-\ntrol, a domain that spans automation from basic manipulation\nto complex interaction with dynamic environments [22]. The\nintegration of artificial intelligence, particularly reinforcement\nlearning, has endowed robotic agents with a high level of\nautonomy, enabling them to learn, adapt and optimise their\ndecision-making policies over time [23]\u2013[25].\nIt is conceivable to design learning algorithms that adjust a\nrobot's policies for the purpose of steganography, guiding it\nto embed hidden messages within its very motions. However,\na legitimate robot may have integrity regulations in place\nto protect the fundamental ethical and safety guidelines pro-\ngrammed into its underlying control model [26]\u2013[28]. Any\nunauthorised attempts to modify the robot might not go\nunnoticed. Such illicit manipulations could trigger alarms and\nactivate built-in safeguard mechanisms to prevent catastrophic\nconsequences. Thus, we propose a research challenge, one that\nrequires steganographic methodology in robotics to adhere to\nthe constraint of perfect robot integrity.\nIn this study, we introduce a steganographic methodology in\nthe context of robotic motion control, subject to the constraint\nof perfect robot integrity. We exploit the robot's sensitivity\nto environmental fluctuations, representing messages as subtle\ndeviations in its motion trajectory. The causal relationships\nbetween the influencing factors and the message symbols are\nestablished through a trial-and-error heuristic in a simulated\nvirtual environment, until each message symbol is uniquely\nrepresented. The synchronised encoding and decoding pro-\ncesses are then applied in the physical world, where the robot's\nmotion trajectory serves as the medium for transmitting secret\ninformation.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Sec-\ntion II outlines the key concepts in robotic motion control\nthat underpin this study. Section III formalises the problem\nand methodology for steganography in robotic motion con-\ntrol. Section IV explores the statistical aspects of capacity\nsettings through theoretical analysis. Section V presents the\nexperimental validation across various motion control tasks\nand multimodal robotic agents, including visualisations of\nsimulated environments and performance evaluations on ca-\npacity, secrecy and efficiency. Finally, Section VI concludes\nthe paper with a summary of research findings and potential\nfuture directions."}, {"title": "II.

Dynamical Simulation", "content": "The field of robotics has been propelled by the quest for\ndeveloping generalist robotic policies capable of handling a\nbroad spectrum of tasks, including manipulation, grasping\nand assembly, with precision and autonomy [29]. To eval-\nuate robotic policies, real-world benchmarks are crucial as\nthey provide assessments in uncontrolled environments, with\nvarying environmental factors such as lighting conditions,\nmaterial properties and sensor errors [30]. However, real-\nworld evaluation is hindered by several limitations, including\nresource-demanding and time-consuming setup and mainte-\nnance. Additionally, it faces challenges in scalability and re-\nproducibility, as testing a wide variety of conditions efficiently\nand ensuring consistent experimental conditions in dynamic\nreal-world environments can be difficult.\nThese constraints become particularly evident as robotic\nsystems are deployed in complex environments, driving a\nshift toward simulation-based evaluations as a more cost-\nefficient, scalable and reproducible alternative. Simulators\nequipped with physics engines offer a sufficiently realistic\napproximation of physical systems, capturing the essential\ndynamics that allow robots to be evaluated under controlled\nvirtual conditions [31]\u2013[34]. These simulations can mimic the\ndynamics of real-world interactions, enabling the evaluation of\nrobotic policies across various scenarios with unlimited trails.\nThe flexibility to subtly manipulate various environmental fac-\ntors, coupled with the capability for repeated trials, provides an\nideal platform for the proposed steganographic methodology."}, {"title": "B. Mechanical Robot", "content": "A robot is a physical agent equipped with sensors, actuators\nand computational resources. It interacts with the environment\nby perceiving states through its sensors and taking actions\nautonomously via its actuators [35]. A robot's actions are\ngoverned by an underlying policy model, which maps the\nsensed state to an optimal action [36]. In reinforcement\nlearning, this policy is often learned through interactions with\nthe environment to maximise cumulative rewards [37]\u2013[41].\nThe development of multimodal robotic agents has advanced\nrobotic motion control through the integration of multiple sen-\nsory modalities such as auditory, visual and linguistic informa-\ntion [42]\u2013[45]. These multimodal sensors enhance contextual\nawareness and human-machine interaction, enabling robots\nto respond more intelligently and interact more naturally\nwith human operators. For example, a visual-language-action\nrobotic agent can process visual scenes to understand the\ncontext of the environment and interpret linguistic commands\nfrom humans to execute specific actions\nA robotic arm is a mechanical system designed to replicate\nthe functions of a human arm, serving as an ideal example\nfor demonstrating robotic motion control [46]. These arms are\nwidely used in industrial applications due to their versatility\nin executing complex manoeuvres. A common type of robotic\narm, designed with 7 degrees of freedom, exhibits motions\ntypes:\n\u2022 Positional Motion: The motion that moves the position\nof the end effector in a linear direction along predefined\naxes (X, Y and Z).\n\u2022 Rotational Motion: The motion that adjusts the orienta-\ntion of the end effector (pitch, yaw and roll).\n\u2022 Functional Motion: The motion that controls the gripping\nmechanism of the end effector such as claws or fingers\nto grasp or release.\nThis study aims to develop a steganographic methodology\ncapable of seamlessly operating within scenarios involving\nmodern robotic agents."}, {"title": "III. STEGANOGRAPHY IN ROBOTICS", "content": "This section outlines the methodology for steganography in\nthe context of robotic motion control. We begin by presenting\nthe problem formulation, which defines the core components\nand constraints of the research. Following that, a trial-and-\nerror heuristic is introduced, leveraging the robot's sensitivity\nto environmental changes for covert communication of secret\ninformation"}, {"title": "A. Problem Formulation", "content": "We present a formal problem of steganography applied to\nrobotics, where the objective is to covertly encode a secret\nmessage into the motions of a robot. The sender Alice influ-\nences the robot's motions while it is tasked with performing\na predefined mission. The receiver Bob observes the motion\nsignal from a remote location and decodes the secret message\nembedded in the motions. This subliminal communication\nshould not significantly interfere with the robot's normal\noperations for the secrecy requirement.\nFormally, let the robot's motion trajectory be defined as a\nsequence of actions $a = \\{a_1,a_2,...,a_T\\}$, where $a_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\nrepresents the configuration of the arm at time-step t, with T\nbeing the total number of time steps. For instance, the action\nat each time-step can correspond to the 7 degrees of freedom,\nassuming a 7-axis robotic arm. The robot's decision process\nis governed by a pre-trained control model, which determines\nhow the robot acts and moves from an initial state to a terminal\nstate. Alice, who is located in the same environment as the\nrobot, can stimulate subtle deviations in the motion trajec-\ntory to encode an intended secret message m. Bob, located\nremotely, can observe the motion trajectory a from which the\nmessage m is decoded. The motion signal is transmitted as\npart of the robot's built-in communication system, which is\ndesigned for real-time monitoring and tracking of the robot's\noperations to support diagnostics and ensure safety. Some\nsensitive data, such as camera scenes, may be unavailable\nfor analysis due to privacy regulations. In this context, Al-\nice exploits the robot's surveillance system to communicate\nsecretly with Bob, who disguises himself as an authorised\nobserver and gains access to the motion signal under the\npretence of performing legitimate maintenance duties. In this\nsteganographic framework, the following core constraints are\napplied."}, {"title": "B. Trail-and-Error Heuristic", "content": "The robot's control model can be sensitive to environmental\nstimuli, meaning that changes in the surroundings, such as the\nintroduction of new objects or variations in the background,\ncan affect its decision-making processes. These changes may\nlead to deviations in the robot's planned trajectory or force\nit to adapt its actions to accommodate and account for the\nnew environmental factors. On the one hand, such sensitivity\ncould potentially enhance the robot's ability to operate in\ndynamic environments; on the other hand, it also exposes\npotential vulnerabilities, as unforeseen environmental changes\ncan cause unintended consequences that disrupt the robot's\nnormal functioning.\nIn view of this, we propose a trial-and-error heuristic that\nexploits the robot's sensitivity to environmental changes for\nencoding and decoding hidden messages, as illustrated in\nFigure 1. Initially, Alice and Bob agree upon a common\nstego-key, which serves as the seed for initialising a shared\ndecoder, ensuring the synchronisation of encoding and de-\ncoding processes. According to Kerckhoffs's principle and\nShannon's maxim in cryptography, one ought to assume that\nthe enemy knows the system [47]. A system should be secure,\neven if everything about the system, except the key, is public\nknowledge. In other words, the security of a system should\nnot rely on the secrecy of the algorithm, but rather on the\nsecrecy of the key. In a steganographic system, the security\nis governed by a stego-key, which coordinates the operations\nbetween the two parties, Alice and Bob.\nAlice exploits the robot's sensitivity to environmental\nchanges by sampling and placing subtle stimuli in its environ-\nment, which influence the robot's motion trajectory. Each re-\nsulting motion trajectory can be mapped to a message symbol\nby the shared decoder, which, being a many-to-one function,\nmay produce duplicate symbols. Therefore, the process is\niterated (in a simulated cyber environment), following a trial-\nand-error heuristic, with stimuli being resampled until all\nunique message symbols are represented. Once the set of\nstimuli corresponding to the entire symbol space has been\nestablished, these stimuli are applied (in the physical world) to\nencode any secret message, which is then communicated in the\nform of a motion trajectory. Bob, located remotely, observes\nthe motion trajectory and uses the shared decoder to extract\nthe hidden message. This method preserves the integrity of\nthe robot's control model while allowing for asymptotically\nminimal deviation as the number of trials increases. A step-\nby-step methodology is outlined as follows.\n\u2022 Initialisation of Decoder: Alice and Bob exchange a\ncommon stego-key, from which the shared decoder is ini-\ntialised, as denoted by\n$D = init(k)$.\nThis decoder function serves as a mapping from the action\nsequence to the message space M. :\n\u2022 Initialisation of Encoder: Alice randomly samples a\nstimulus and places it within the simulated cyber environ-\nment, causing a slight environmental change. The sequence of\nactions is generated though the interactions between the robot\nand its environment in the presence of the stimulus \u03c8, as given\nby\n$a = interact(\\psi)$.\nThis action sequence is then mapped to a message symbol by\nthe shared decoder. The process is iterative, with new stimuli\nbeing resampled and trials executed until the set of decoded\nsymbols covers all possible symbols in the message space M.\nTherefore, each distinct message symbol can be encoded as\nan environmental stimulus, as represented by\n$\\psi_m = E(m)$.\nFor symbols that correspond to more than one stimulus, the\nstimulus resulting in the optimal motion trajectory (which\nminimises time costs or maximises efficiency) can be chosen.\n\u2022 Encoding process: On the transmitting side, Alice\nencodes the intended message as its corresponding stimulus\nand positions it in the physical environment, influencing the\nrobot's motion during its interactions with the environment, as\nexpressed by\n$a = interact(E(m))$.\n\u2022 Decoding process: At the receiving end, Bob applies the\nshared decoder to the observed motion trajectory and extracts\nthe hidden message by\n$m = D(a)$."}, {"title": "IV. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS", "content": "The code construction begins by fixing the decoder, and\nthen establishes the encoder by randomly sampling codes\n(stimuli) until every symbol in the message space is uniquely\nrepresented by at least one sampled code. The capacity is\ncalculated as the binary logarithm of the message space size,\nlog2 ||M||, with the unit expressed in bits per trajectory. The\nmain challenge in this process lies in determining how many\nrandom codes must be sampled to achieve complete coverage\nof all message symbols with high confidence. This section\nseeks to answer questions of how many trials are needed\nto ensure success with high confidence and how likely is\ncomplete coverage after a given number of trials."}, {"title": "A. Random Coding", "content": "The trial-and-error heuristic can be implemented using a\ndecoder constructed with hashing and modular arithmetic.\nSpecifically, the decoder employs a keyed hash function fol-\nlowed by modular reduction to ensure that all possible codes\nare confined to the fixed range of the message space, as\nexpressed by\n$m = hash(m) \\mod ||M||$\nThis decoder deterministically maps each sampled code to\na symbol within the message space. The uniformity of the\nhash function minimises the likelihood of uneven distribution,\nensuring that symbols in the message space are approximately\nequally represented. This uniformity allows for straightforward\ntheoretical analysis of the relationships between the number\nof trials and the full coverage the message space. Note that,\ndespite its theoretical simplicity, this decoding approach is sen-\nsitive to errors which might arise in practical implementations.\nAlthough addressing the robustness limitations lies beyond the\nscope of this study, further investigation into a more adaptable\ndecoding mechanism could enhance resilience against errors."}, {"title": "B. Expected Number of Trials", "content": "The problem of determining the required number of random\ncodes to cover all n message symbols is analogous to the\ncoupon collector's problem in probability theory. This problem\nconcerns the expected time (number of trials) to collect all n\ndistinct items (coupons), assuming each trial independently\nand uniformly selects one item. This expected value is given\nby\n$E[T_n] = n \\cdot (1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + ... + \\frac{1}{n}) = n \\cdot H_n$,\nwhere where Hn is the n-th harmonic number (the sum of the\nreciprocals of the first n natural numbers). The n-th harmonic\nnumber is about as large as the natural logarithm of n by\napproximating the sum with the integral:\n$H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k} \\approx \\int_1^n \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln n$,\nAs n goes to infinity, the difference between the harmonic\nseries and the natural logarithm approaches asymptotically\ntowards the limit known as the Euler-Mascheroni constant:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (H_n - \\ln n) = \\gamma$.\nGiven the asymptotic behaviour of the harmonic number, the\nexpected value can be approximated as\n$n \\cdot H_n \\sim n \\cdot (\\ln n + \\gamma)$.\nThis results characterises the expected behaviour of the sam-\npling process and highlights that collecting the final few\nitems takes disproportionately longer than the initial ones,\na phenomenon often referred to as the diminishing returns."}, {"title": "C. Probability of Complete Coverage", "content": "Another central question concerns the probability of com-\nplete coverage after t trials. Instead of directly calculating the\nprobability that all n items are drawn, we begin by finding\nthe probability that at least one item is not drawn after t\ntrials and then subtract this from 1. For at least one item to\nremain uncollected, there must exist a subset of k items (where\n$1 \\le k \\le n$) that are not collected at all. The probability that\nexactly k specific items are not drawn after t trials is given\nby\n$\\frac{\\binom{n}{k} \\left( \\frac{n-k}{n} \\right)^t}{\\binom{n}{1}}$\nWhen calculating the probability that at least one item is not\ndrawn, overlaps between subsets of uncollected items must\nbe carefully accounted for. The inclusion-exclusion principle\naddresses this by alternately adding and subtracting probabili-\nties of subsets of increasing size. Starting with the probability\nof missing single items, we subtract probabilities for pairs of\nmissing items to correct overcounting, then add probabilities\nfor triples to correct undercounting, and so on. This alternating\nprocess handles all overlaps, leading to the probability that at\nleast one item is not drawn after t trials. Finally, subtracting\nthis from 1 gives the likelihood of achieving complete cover-\nage in a finite number of trials:\n$P(t) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} \\binom{n}{k} \\left( \\frac{n-k}{n} \\right)^t$"}, {"title": "V.

The robotic embodiments were\ncontrolled by two multimodal policy models: the motions in\nthe first two tasks were governed by OpenVLA [49], while the\nmotions in the latter two tasks were directed by Octo [50].

Secrecy Analysis", "content": "We evaluated secrecy via the statistics of trajectory lengths.\nFigure 5 depicts the lengths of steganographic trajectories\ncompared to the length of the non-stimulated trajectory. The\ndeviations in trajectory lengths reflect the steganographic im-\npact, which did not result in a monotonic increase or decrease\nthe task completion times. Instead, unpredictable variations\nwere observed in the lengths of steganographic trajectories.\nWhile these deviations in trajectory lengths provide an initial\nindication of the potential inconspicuousness of the stegano-\ngraphic system, this metric alone may not fully capture the\ncomprehensive statistics related to secrecy.

The results underscore the balance between capacity\nand efficiency, demonstrating that smaller message spaces\nenable faster convergence, whereas larger spaces necessitate\nadditional trials to maintain high coverage probabilities."}, {"title": "VI. CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This study introduced a steganographic paradigm in robotic\nmotion control, exploring the robot's sensitivity to environ-\nmental stimuli to allow covert communication via motion\ntrajectories. Following the formulated principles regarding\nmaximal robot integrity and minimal motion deviation, we\ndemonstrated how a message can be encoded as an envi-\nronmental stimulus that influences the interactions between\nthe robotic agent and the environment and how this mes-\nsage can be decoded from the resulting motion trajectory.\nThis research marks the beginning of a broader enquiry,\nwith potential limitations to address and future directions\nto pursue. First, a formal secrecy evaluation through ste-\nganalysis is necessary to assess vulnerability to analytical\ndetection mechanisms tailored to this domain. Second, the\ncapacity of the steganographic system, measured in bits per\ntrajectory, could be further optimised through more efficient\ncoding methodologies. Third, factors such as cyber-physical\ngaps, observational imperfections and the presence of active\nadversaries could compromise steganographic communication,\nand therefore robustness against such errors at the receiving\nend warrants investigation. We envision that the concept of\ncyber-physical steganography in robotics will pave the way\nfor broadening the scope of what constitutes channels for\nsteganographic communication."}]}

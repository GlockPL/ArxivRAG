Sentiment analysis, the process of determining the emotional tone behind a body of text, is crucial for understanding consumer opinions and behaviors. In this study, we employ RoBERTa to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews, aiming to derive sentiment scores that reflect the underlying emotions expressed in the reviews.\nROBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach) is an enhanced version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), designed to improve performance by training with larger mini-batches and longer sequences. It leverages the transformer architecture, which relies on self-attention mechanisms to process and encode the context of words in a sentence effectively.\nIn our research, we utilize these models to analyze a substantial dataset of Amazon product reviews. By applying these state-of-the-art NLP techniques, we generate sentiment scores for each review, quantifying the positivity or negativity of the expressed sentiments. This allows us to evaluate the accuracy of sentiment scores produced by RoBERTa\nBeyond merely obtaining sentiment scores, our study delves into data analysis and visualization to observe patterns and trends in review sentiments. Through this, we explore how these sentiment scores align with principles of behavioral economics, such as electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), consumer emotional reactions, and the confirmation bias. eWOM refers to the influence of online user-generated content on consumer decisions, consumer emotional reactions describe how emotions affect purchasing behaviors,"}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved significantly over the past few decades, transitioning from rule-based systems to more sophisticated machine learning techniques.

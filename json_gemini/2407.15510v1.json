INTRODUCTION", "content": "Abstraction is key to human and artificial intelligence (AI) as it allows one to see common structure in otherwise distinct objects or situations (Giunchiglia & Walsh, 1992; Saitta & Zucker, 2013) and as such it is a key element for generality in computer science and artificial intelligence (McCarthy, 1987; Kramer, 2007). It has been studied in the fields of theorem proving (e.g. Plaisted, 1981) and knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&R) by a number of authors (e.g. Knoblock, 1994; Sacerdoti, 1974), and it has recently gained momentum in answer set programming (Saribatur & Eiter, 2020; Saribatur, Eiter, & Sch\u00fcller, 2021), one of the most prominent formalisms in the field of KR&R (see e.g. Brewka, Eiter, & Truszczynski, 2011; Lifschitz, 2019). Saribatur et al. (2021) contain a very rich bibliography for readers interested in the literature on abstraction.\nAnti-unification (or generalization) (cf. Cerna & Kutsia, 2023) is the field of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science studying abstraction. It is the \"dual\" operation to the well-studied unification operation (cf. Baader & Snyder, 2001). More formally, given two terms s and t, unification searches for a substitution the most general unifier \u03c3 satisfying $s \\sigma = t \\sigma$, whereas syntactic anti-unification searches for the least general generalization u such that $s = u\\tau$ and $t = u\\theta$, for some substitutions \u03c3,\u03b8. Notice the difference between the two operations: while unification computes a substitution, anti-unification computes a term.\nSyntactic anti-unification has been introduced by Plotkin (1970) and Reynolds (1970), and it has found numerous applications in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, as for example in inductive logic programming (Muggleton, 1991) (cf. Cropper & Morel, 2021; Cropper, 2022), programming by example (Gulwani, 2016), library learning and compression (Cao et al., 2023), and, in the form of E-generalization (i.e. anti-unification modulo theory) (Heinz, 1995; Burghardt, 2005) in analogy-making (Weller & Schmid, 2007; Schmidt et al., 2014) (for further applications, see e.g. Barwell et al., 2018; de Sousa et al., 2021; Vanhoof & Yernaux, 2019).\nThe purpose of this paper is to initiate an algebraic theory of anti-unification within general algebras. More formally, given two algebras A and B in the sense of general algebra (cf. Burris &"}, {"title": "2. PRELIMINARIES", "content": "We expect the reader to be fluent in basic general algebra as it is presented for example in Burris and Sankappanavar (2000, \u00a7II).\nA language L of algebras is a set of function symbols together with a rank function $r : L \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$. Moreover, we assume a denumerable set X of variables distinct from L. Terms are formed as usual from variables in X and function symbols in L and we denote the set of all such terms by $T_{L,x}$. The set of variables occurring in a term s are denoted by X(s) and s has rank k iff $X(s) = {x_1,..., x_k}$. The rank of s is denoted by $r_s$.\nAn L-algebra A consists of a non-empty set A, the universe of A, and for each function symbol $f \\in L$, a function $f_A : A^{r(f)} \\rightarrow A$, the functions of A (the distinguished elements of A are the 0-ary functions). We will not distinguish between distinguished elements and their 0-ary function symbols.\nAn algebra is injective iff each of its function is injective. Notice that every distinguished element a of A is a 0-ary function $a : A^0 \\rightarrow A$ which maps some single dummy element in $A^0$ to a and thus is injective.\nEvery term s induces a term function $s_A$ on A in the usual way. In this paper, we shall not distinguish between terms inducing the same function on the underlying algebra, which is common practice in mathematics where one does usually not distinguish, for example, between the terms $2x^2$ and $(1 + 1)x^2$ in arithmetic.\nFact 1. Every term function induced by injective functions is injective.\nThe term algebra $T_{L,x}$ over L and X is the algebra we obtain by interpreting each function symbol $f \\in L$ by\n$f^{T_{L,x}}: T_{L,x}: s_1 ... s_{r(f)} \\rightarrow f(s_1,..., s_{r(f)})$.\nA substitution is a mapping $\\sigma : X \\rightarrow T_{L,x}$, where $x \\sigma := x$ for all but finitely many variables, extended from X to terms in $T_{L,x}$ inductively as usual, and we write $s \\sigma$ for the application of \u03c3 to the term s. For two terms s, t \u2208 $T_{L,x}$, we define the syntactic generalization ordering by\n$s \\leq t \\Leftrightarrow s = t\\sigma$, for some substitution \u03c3."}, {"title": "3. ANTI-UNIFICATION", "content": "This is the main section of the paper. Here we shall introduce algebraic anti-unification and derive some elementary observations.\nIn the rest of the paper, let A and B be L-algebras over some joint language of algebras L, and let (A, B) be a pair of L-algebras. We will always write A instead of $A_A$.\nDefinition 2. Given an L-term s, define\n$\\downarrow_A s := {s^A (\\sigma) \\in A | \\sigma \\in A^{r(s)}} \\,$.\nIn case $a \\in \\downarrow_A s$, we say that s is a generalization of a and a is an instance of s.\nFact 3. Every distinguished element $a \\in A$ is an instance of itself since\n(1)  $a \\in \\downarrow_A a = {a} \\,$.\nDefinition 4. Define the (semantic) generalization ordering for two L-terms s and t in (A, B) by\n$s \\sqsubseteq_{(A,B)} t :\\Leftrightarrow \\downarrow_A s \\subseteq \\downarrow_A t \\text{ and } \\downarrow_B s \\subseteq \\downarrow_B t$,\nand\n$s \\equiv_{(A,B)} t :\\Leftrightarrow s \\sqsubseteq_{(A,B)} t \\text{ and } t \\sqsubseteq_{(A,B)} s$.\nExample 5. $0x \\equiv_{(\\mathbb{N},.,0)} 0$.\nFact 6. The generalization ordering $\\sqsubseteq_{(A,B)}$ is a pre-order between L-terms, for any pair of L-algebras (A, B), that is, it is reflexive and transitive.\nFact 7. For any distinguished element $a \\in A$, we have by (1):\n$\\text{a } \\sqsubseteq_A s \\Leftrightarrow a \\in \\downarrow_A s$,\nand\n$s \\equiv_A a \\Leftrightarrow s \\sqsubseteq_A a \\Leftrightarrow s \\text{ is a constant function with value a}.\nFor two distinguished elements a, b \u2208 A, we have\n$a \\sqsubseteq_A b \\Leftrightarrow \\downarrow_A a\\subseteq \\downarrow_A b \\Leftrightarrow {a} \\subseteq {b} \\Leftrightarrow a \\equiv b \\Leftrightarrow a = b$.\nRemark 8. Notice that our semantic generalization ordering differs from the usual one in syntactic anti-unification \u2264 where a term s is said to be more general than a term tiff there is a substitution \u03c3 such that $t = s\\sigma$.\nDefinition 9.

CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper introduced algebraic anti-unification in the general setting of general algebra thus com- plementing the purely syntactic theory of anti-unification from the literature as initiated in the seminal works of Reynolds (1970) and Plotkin (1970).\nA major line of future research is to make progress towards the following fundamental problem:\nProblem 44. Given two L-algebras A and B, what is the generalization type of (A, B)? For what kind of algebras is the problem decidable? In those cases where it is decidable, provide an (efficient) algorithm.\nThe framework of this paper is unilingual in the sense that the underlying languages of the in- volved algebras are the same. This is common practice in general algebra. However, one can easily imagine practical scenarios in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, where different underlying languages are desired. A major line of future theoretical research therefore is to generalize the notions and results of this paper from a unilingual to a bilingual setting where the underlying languages $L_A$ and $L_B$ of A and B may differ. One possibility is to use the well-known notion of interpretability of one theory into another (see e.g. Hinman, 2005, \u00a72.6) (recall that an algebra is a structure in the logical sense without relations other than equality).\nFrom a practical point of view, the main line of future research is to study computability and complexity issues. Recall that in \u00a78, we have shown that in finite unary algebras (aka semiautomata), minimally general generalizations can be computed using standard techniques from the theory of finite automata. Moreover, in \u00a710, we have shown that more generally, in any finite algebra, we can use tree automata to compute minimally general k-generalizations, for any k. This is closely related to finite model theory (see e.g. Ebbinghaus & Flum, 1999; Libkin, 2012). However, since in practice we often encounter finitely representable infinite structures (Blumensath & Gr\u00e4del, 2000, 2004), obtaining analous computability results is mandatory.\nAnother important line of applied future research is to develop efficient algorithms for the compu- tation of minimally general generalizations in finite and infinite structures and to provide implemen- tations which can be used in practice."}]}

While there has been significant progress in capturing high-throughput observational data across real-world entities across diverse paradigms [1], there is considerable interest in deciphering their associations using novel approaches. Such a data-driven approach can assist in hypothesis testing by validating known associations as well as hypothesis generation by discovering novel associations, while providing novel system-level insights, a precursor to evidence-generation and developing effective interventions. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature including Bayesian Structure Learning (BSL) algorithms for modeling associations from real world observational data [2-5]. BSL models the joint probability distribution of the entities of interest as a product of marginal conditional probability distributions. The resulting network structure is represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where the nodes and edges represent the entities of interest and their associations respectively. Since BSL algorithms can return DAGs that are probabilistically indistinguishable or Markov equivalent, the resulting structure is represented as a Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (PDAG) [2, 6]. Under certain implicit assumptions [3], PDAGs may provide cues on potential causal relationships between the entities.\nBSL is a NP-hard problem with the number of possible DAG structures increasing super-exponentially with the number of nodes [7, 8]. Several computational approaches have been proposed for learning the DAG structure from multivariate cross-sectional profiles with applications to diverse areas spanning molecular profiling [9, 10], genetics [11], microbiome [12], and healthcare [13]. Computational approaches for BSL broadly fall under constraint-based, score-based, and hybrid approaches [14, 15]. Constraint-based approaches recover the optimal DAG using tests for conditional independence whereas score-based approaches identify the DAG that best represents the given data using a search- criteria in conjunction with a scoring function. Hybrid approaches adopt a combination of constraint- based and score-based approaches in identifying the optimal DAG by minimizing the space of potential DAGs. Recent studies on benchmarking BSL algorithms have focused primarily on the sample size and the dimensionality of the data represented by the number of nodes in the DAG [16-18]. A recent study [19] compared constraint-based, score-based and hybrid approaches, across small and large sample- sizes, as well as across categorical and continuous variables. The results did not reveal a systematic difference in the ranking of the three approaches in terms of speed and accuracy. Subsequent investigation by increasing the sample size improved the goodness of fit and decreased the variability of the learned DAGs. However, the performance was found to plateau at sample sizes around five times the number of parameters of the generating models. The present study is significant as it investigates the impact of network topology on BSL algorithms, while constraining the dimensionality (i.e. nodes, edges) and sample-size of the data to be identical across these topologies. Constraining these parameters to be identical essentially eliminates them as potential contributors to the observed differences in benchmarking measures such as sensitivity. Sensitivity estimates of three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms (PC: Peter-Clarke, GS: Grow-Shrink, IM: fast-Incremental Association Markov Blanket) [20-23] in inferring associations from linear and nonlinear models of DAG structures with markedly different topologies (B: sub-linear, L: linear, U: super-linear) generated using the preferential attachment (PA) [24, 25] is investigated Fig. 1. For the linear model, the signal at a node is determined as the superposition of the aggregate signal from its parent nodes and noise. For the nonlinear model, the signal at a node is determined as the superposition of the nonlinear transform of the aggregate signal from those of its parents and noise. The nonlinear transform was chosen as the static, invertible sigmoidal function. The choice of the sigmoidal function can be attributed to its prevalence across DAGs such as feed-forward neural networks [26, 27], and its relevance in modeling real-world phenomenon including (i) all-or-none response [28], (ii) enzyme kinetics [29], and (iii) transcriptional cooperativity [30]. The PA algorithm generates networks whose growth pattern and likelihood of connection \u03c0(k) scales with the degree centrality (k) as \u03c0(k) ~ k\u03b3, where y is the scaling exponent [25]. PA relies on the underlying assumption that new nodes prefer to connect to highly connected nodes in a network and accompanied by positively skewed degree centrality distributions observed widely in real-world networks. More specifically, PA overcomes some of the limitations of traditional random graph models such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs [31], accompanied by binomial degree centrality distributions that do not sufficiently capture the growth process of real-world networks.

Since the number of edges of the DAG (Nnods \u2013 1) in this study was significantly lower than the maximum possible edges i.e. Nnods(Nnods-1)/2, sensitivity as opposed to specificity was chosen for benchmarking BSL performance. Sensitivity estimates were determined as the proportion of true edges of the corresponding PDAG generated by moralizing the DAG returned by the BSL algorithm"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Constraint-based BSL as noted earlier uses tests for conditional independence for structure learning and rely on the local Markov property, where a given node in the DAG is independent of its non-descendants given its parents. This property especially emphasizes the importance of the in-degree distribution, Fig. 1. More importantly, the differences in the in-degree of a node can impact the number of parameters associated with it and performance of the constraint-based BSL algorithm. While the number of nodes and edges (dimensionality) were constrained to be identical across the three topologies in the present study, there were marked differences in the in-degree distributions between the DAG topologies. For instance, the maximum in-degree of the DAGs for sub-linear, linear, and super-linear topologies with dimensionality (Nnods = 48) were 8, 17, and 28, corresponding to ~17%, ~36% and ~60% of their total edges respectively, Fig. 1. Of interest is to that the maximum in-degree of the DAG with super-linear topology was markedly higher than that of sub-linear topology.\nLinear Model: Sensitivity estimates of the three BSL algorithms (PC, GS, IM) for the linear model, across the three network topologies (B, L, U), with (N = 210) is shown in Fig. 2. Sensitivity estimates of (PC, GS, IM) exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing scaling exponent (y = 0.25, 1.0, 1.25) for the three topologies (B, L, U). The decrease was statistically significant (a = 0.05) between DAG topologies B and U as revealed by Wilcoxon-Ranksum test, Fig. 3. This behavior was consistently observed with variation in the dimensionality (Nnods = 48,64), noise strengths (\u03c3 = 3,6) and across the three BSL algorithms. As expected, the sensitivity estimates also exhibited a decrease with increasing noise strengths (\u03c3 = 3 to 6) and increasing dimensionality (Nnods = 48 to 64)."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "While there has been significant progress in generating multivariate cross-sectional data across real- world entities, there is a need for novel approaches in deciphering their associations. Such an understanding is critical for gaining system-level insights and behavior that may not be readily apparent from reductionist representations.

These approaches can validate known associations while discovering novel associations from multivariate cross-sectional data. Traditional benchmarking of BSL algorithms had focussed primarily on the dimensionality and sample-size. The present study elucidated marked variations in sensitivity estimates of constraint-based BSL algorithms across distinct network topologies while constraining the dimensionality (i.e. nodes, edges), and sample size to be identical between them. The results were demonstrated across linear and nonlinear models of networks with varying number of nodes, noise strengths, and three popular constraint-based BSL algorithms. More importantly, PDAG sensitivity estimates of the super-linear topologies was shown to be significantly lesser than that of sub-linear topologies across linear and nonlinear models. Variations in the in-degree distributions between the super-linear and sub-linear topology may explain the difference in the sensitivity estimates, since constraint-based BSL rely on the local Markov property. These preliminary findings clearly demonstrate the importance of accommodating network topology in BSL benchmarking exercises in addition to factors such as dimensionality and sample size."}]}

This methodology operates through a new\ninteraction between gradient-based updates and contextual rep-\nresentations within the neural architecture of language models.\nThe concept seeks to foster a form of entanglement where\ngradients are not treated as isolated mathematical entities but\nas dynamically linked processes that capture and reinforce\ncontextual dependencies. This interwoven gradient framework\nrepresents a paradigm shift in how contextual information is\nintegrated and utilized during the model's optimization and\ntraining phases.\nThe research gap explored in this work stems from the\nreliance of current models on static and often oversimplified\nmechanisms for contextual integration.

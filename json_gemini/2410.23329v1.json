Most medical devices are tested and labeled with MRI safety information,\nfollowing the American College of Radiology recommendations [1]. Recent work has shown low risk from MRI of\nvarious implants, including cardiac pacemakers [2], orthopaedic hardware [3], neurostimulators [4], medicine pumps [5],\ncochlear implants [6], and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts [7]. MRI with many implanted devices can, in controlled\nsituations, be performed without damaging the device or injuring the patient.\nOne of the most common scenarios involving metal implants in MRI exams is the orthopaedic evaluation of joints\nthat have undergone total joint arthroplasty (TJA) or have been treated with artificial implants. The U.S. population\naged 65 and over is growing nearly five times faster than the overall population, according to the 2020 Census. This\ndemographic shift, coupled with a higher prevalence of age-related conditions such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, is\ndriving an increased demand for TJA. A recent study by Shichman et al. [8], analyzing Medicare demographic data,\nprojected a 42% increase in revision total hip arthroplasty (rTHA) procedures by 2040, doubling to 101% by 2060. The\noutlook for revision total knee arthroplasty (rTKA) is even more striking, with anticipated increases of 149% by 2040\nand 520% by 2060.\nComplications from arthroplasty procedures often stem from the gradual wear of the implant due to regular joint\nmovement [9], which can lead to progressive bone loss. This may result in severe and chronic conditions such as\nosteolysis, bone breakdown, and eventual aseptic loosening of the implant components [10]. Detecting osteolysis and\naseptic loosening using MRI poses significant challenges MRI scans, where substantial artifacts near joint replacement\nhardware can obscure regions of primary concern for bone and soft tissue pathology [11, 12].\nWhile fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequences help mitigate signal dropout caused by intravoxel dephasing, the resulting\nimages still suffer from severe distortion and missing signal from spins resonating outside the radiofrequency bandwidth.\nThree-dimensional (3D) multi-spectral imaging (MSI) was developed to address these issues by acquiring several\nband-limited 3D-FSE volumes at discrete Larmor frequency offsets [13, 14, 15]. These so-called spectral \"bin\"\nimages are combined after reconstruction to produce an artifact-reduced volume. However, while MSI generates\nhigh-quality images near metal implants, it comes at the cost of extended scan times due to the need to acquire multiple\n3D-FSE volumes. To minimize partial saturation artifacts between overlapping spectral profiles, a technique known as\nconcatenation [16] is employed, where only a subset of bin volumes is acquired within each repetition period (TR).\nThis results in scan times of TR \u00d7 Ns \u00d7 Nc, where Ns is the number of shots or echo trains needed to fill k-space, and\nNc is the number of concatenations.\nFor a typical proton density-weighted MSI of the knee, with Nc = 2, TR \u2248 4 s, and Ns \u2248 40, scan times can reach\napproximately 5.5 minutes while collecting 24 spectral bin volumes (Nbins). The approximated number of shots (40)\nneeded to fill k-space is typical for phase-encoded matrix (ky\u00d7kz) sizes of 256\u00d732 with an echo train length of 32,\n2\u00d72 acceleration, and partial Fourier sampling with 8 oversampling lines.\nHigher numbers of phase encode can be achieved with modest increases in acquisition time using longer echo trains\nwith refocusing flip-angle modulation and reducing the number of acquired spectral bins through prospective calibration\nprocedures [17]. However, isotropic MSI applications still face limitations due to trade-offs between signal-to-noise\nratio, isotropic spatial resolution, and acquisition duration. As demonstrated by Zochowski et al. [18], isotropic MSI\nnear total hip replacements (THR) can be acquired with 1.3 mm resolution in 6.5 to 7 minutes. Despite the superiority\nof these images compared to conventional MSI for THR assessment, further improvements in resolution and efficiency\nare necessary to enable widespread use in evaluations near hardware within the knee, shoulder, elbow, and ankle.\nThe primary goal of this approach is to reduce scan time, with the VR sampling scheme acquiring routinely used\n2\u00d72 and partial Fourier accelerated k-space data in half of the concatenations, while only the parallel imaging auto-\ncalibrating signal (ACS) k-space lines [19] are acquired in the other half. This method aims to reduce the scan time\nto TR \u00d7Nc\u00d7 (Ns + Ns,acs), where Ns,acs is the number of shots needed to acquire the ACS data only. When\nNs,acs << Ns, this method is roughly 40% more efficient than a conventional MSI scan.\nTo reconstruct the above acquisition, we propose a deep learning reconstruction framework that shifts the computational\nburden to offline model training. This ensures the model can be applied quickly in clinical settings, supporting real-time\nworkflows without delays.\nThe efficiency gains feasible using this approach are mathematically feasible due to the smoothly varying spectrally\nselective profiles in each bin, which overlap significantly between adjacent bins. This MSI spectral windowing approach\nis utilized to reduce residual artifacts in the combination of the spectral bin volumes [15]. Leveraging the overlapping\nbin relationship, we introduce a deep learning model that takes the VR bin images as input to predict full-resolution\nimages from the bins reconstructed using only ACS data. For example, in a typical MSI acquisition with 24 bins, our\nmethod would acquire full k-space data for 12 bins and ACS data for the remaining 12 bins (Figure 1. The deep learning\nmodel would then use the acquired data to predict the full-resolution images for all 24 bins, effectively halving the scan\ntime without compromising image quality.\nThe primary objectives of this work are to develop and validate a novel variable resolution sampling scheme and\ndeep learning reconstruction framework for MSI that significantly reduces scan times while maintaining high image\nquality. We anticipate that this approach will help overcome current limitations in MSI application, enabling improved\nassessment near metal implants and expanding MSI's clinical utility."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "2.1 Datasets\nDatasets utilized for this study were collected under a research registration protocol approved by the local Institutional\nReview Board (IRB). Raw imaging data from proton density-weighted 1.5T MSI acquired within clinical exams of 67\npatients with total knee replacement 65 patients with total hip replacements were extracted for this retrospective study.\nThere were no additional inclusion or exclusion criteria utilized for data collection. All MSI datasets were acquired\nwith 24 spectral bins, a full-width half-maximum RF bandwidth of 2.25 kHz, bin spacing of 1 kHz, an in-plane matrix\nsize of 384 \u00d7 256, and a number of slice encodes ranging between 24 and 32.\nImages from the first concatenation of bins (i.e., odd bins) were reconstructed using locally-developed software\nleveraging a vendor-provided reconstruction toolkit that included parallel imaging [20] and homodyne partial Fourier\nprocessing [21] libraries. Even bins, i.e., the second concatenation, were retrospectively subsampled to include only\nthe 16x16 center of k-space along the phase-encoded dimensions. Low-resolution images were reconstructed from the\nGaussian window-apodized autocalibration signal (ACS) data with an inverse fast Fourier transform and root-sum-of-\nsquares coil combination. All images were zero-filled to a 512 \u00d7 512 in-plane matrix size. The number of subjects\nin the training, validation, and testing datasets were 45, 11, and 11 for the knee data and 47, 9, and 9 for the hip data,\nrespectively.\n2.2 Network Architecture\nThe developed deep learning model inferred full-resolution 2D images for the 12 spectral bins reconstructed using\nonly the ACS data. To achieve this, the input to the network consists of the 2D images from all 24 available VR bins,\nproviding a comprehensive set of features for the model to learn from (Figure 1. Prior to feeding the data into the\nnetwork, the in-plane input is normalized by subtracting the mean signal and dividing by the standard deviation. This\nnormalization step ensures that the input data has a consistent scale, facilitating the learning process and improving the\nmodel's convergence.\nA multi-channel 2D U-Net architecture [22] was implemented using the MONAI framework [23] to handle inputs with\n24 channels. The network consisted of five encoding and decoding layers with 3\u00d73 convolutional kernels. Input data\nwere normalized by subtracting the mean signal and dividing by the standard deviation. The model was trained using an\nAdam optimizer (2 \u00d7 10-4 learning rate) for 50 epochs, with a mini-batch size of 4 slices randomly sampled across\nsubjects. Training used a mean squared error loss function and required approximately 8 hours on an NVIDIA Titan V\nGPU with 12 GB memory (Santa Clara, CA).\n2.3 Analysis\nThe trained SJ-DL and MJ-DL networks were used to perform 2D inferencing of full-resolution spectral bin images\nfor all slices in each test subject. For comparison, two conventional reconstruction techniques were applied to the\nlow-resolution bins (even bins). In the first method (CR-VR), the missing k-space lines were zero-filled, followed by\nreconstruction using an inverse Fourier transform. In the second method (CR-ZReplace), the entire low-resolution bins\nwere replaced with zeros before applying the same conventional reconstruction technique. Composite MSI images were\ngenerated using the square-root sum of squares (RSOS) of the spectral bin images for the reference data, the CR-VR\nand CR-ZReplace reconstructions, and the SJ-DL and MJ-DL inferred data.\nImage quality was assessed both qualitatively, through visual assessment, and quantitatively using two metrics: the\nstructural similarity index (SSIM) [24] and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). SSIM provides a measure of the\nperceived quality of the reconstructed images by accounting for structural information, luminance, and contrast, while\nPSNR quantifies the reconstruction error by measuring the mean squared error (MSE) between the reconstructed and\nreference images.\nTo evaluate the impact of each reconstruction method on the preservation of anatomical borders, spatial gradients\nperpendicular to boundaries were estimated across specified anatomical boundaries where sharp transitions were\nexpected [25]. The regions of interest (ROI) for each dataset were selected based on the optimal visibility of anatomical\nfeatures in the conventionally reconstructed images. In the knee datasets (n=11), the border between the femur and the\nprefemoral fat body was analyzed, while in the hip datasets (n=9), the borders of the femoral head were evaluated.\nAdditionally, the relative edge sharpness index (RESI) [25] was used to quantify the preservation of anatomical\nboundaries. This index was computed by extracting three to four points above the signal floor that perpendicularly\ntraversed the midline of each designated tissue boundary, followed by slope estimation using weighted linear regression.\nTo account for natural anatomical variations, partial volume effects, and potential inconsistencies in manual segmentation,\nthe slopes of the input and inferred images were normalized against the slope of the corresponding conventional image\nas a reference, mitigating the influence of confounding factors on the assessment of boundary preservation."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Figures 2 (knee) and 3 (hip) show representative examples of the reference, CR-VR, CR-ZReplace, and inferred\nfull-resolution images using SJ-DL and MJ-DL models. The columns display three consecutive spectral bins (referenced\nas -1, 0, and 1 kHz offset) along with the corresponding RSOS of all 24 spectral bins.\nThe CR-VR images from bins reconstructed using only the ACS data show very little detail due to the absence of outer\nk-space data. Visually, DL inferencing broadly improves image quality relative to the conventional reconstruction of\nzero-replaced and zero-filled VR undersampled data. However, as evident in the zoomed images, the small amount of\ndata collected in the DL-VR approach improves performance relative to zero-replaceing in areas of high spatial field\ngradients arrows where bin combination stripe artifacts are most prevalent (red arrows, SJ-DL VR vs SJ-DL ZReplace\nrows). There is minimal visual performance difference between the multi-joint (MJ) and single-joint (SJ) DL VR cases.\nFigure 4 provides a box and whisker plot analysis of the SSIM values comparing the bin-combined reference images\nwith DL-inferred VR images for single-joint hip and knee models and the multi-joint model. In the hip dataset\n(Figure 4a), the SSIM values comparing the SJ-DL inferred image to the reference show a median of 0.99 with an\ninterquartile range (IQR) of 0.01, signifying a high level of agreement and a compact distribution of SSIM values.\nCorrespondingly, the PSNR values for the same dataset show a median of 44.18 dB with an IQR of 3.75 dB, while\nthe CR-VR reconstruction yielded a significantly lower PSNR (p < 0.001) with a median of 32.73 dB and an IQR of\n1.93 dB, indicating higher reconstruction error.\nIn the knee dataset (Figure 4b), the SJ-DL reconstructions produced a similarly high median SSIM value of 0.99, with an\neven smaller IQR of 0.004, demonstrating the consistent performance of the U-Net model. The PSNR values for these\nreconstructions show a median of 46.30 dB with an IQR of 2.05 dB, significantly ((p < 0.001) surpassing the CR-VR\nmethod, which had a PSNR median of 33.37 and an IQR of 1.19 dB. Finally, the multi-joint U-Net model (Figure 4c)\nmaintained a high median SSIM value of 0.99 with a narrow IQR of 0.006 across both hip and knee reconstructions.\nThe corresponding PSNR values for the multi-joint reconstructions were similarly high, with a median of 46.48 dB\nand an IQR dB of 2.49. In contrast, the combined CR-VR reconstructions resulted in a significantly lower PSNR (p <\n0.001) with a median of 33.10 dB and an IQR of 1.86 dB. The SSIM comparison for the combined CR-VR images\nalso yielded a significantly lower (p < 0.001) median SSIM of 0.95 with an IQR of 0.02. These SSIM and PSNR\ndistributions indicate that the U-Net model achieves consistently high similarity to the reference images, with superior\nreconstruction accuracy across both body parts, as evidenced by the high median values and narrow IQRs.\nFigure 5 provides representative images and plots of the knee and hip datasets used for the boundary sharpness analysis.\nIt also shows a box-and-whisker plot of the RESI metric. The plot reveals that images reconstructed using DL exhibit\nsignificantly higher edge sharpness (p < 0.001) compared to the CR-VR images. Furthermore, the edge sharpness of\nimages reconstructed using either SJ-DL or MJ-DL models are comparable ((p > 0.05) to that of the reference images\n(p=0.22 and p=0.59 for the hip and knee, respectively)."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This study introduced a variable resolution (VR) sampling scheme tailored to multi-spectral imaging in the presence\nof metal.

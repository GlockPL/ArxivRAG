In a transductive graph learning setting, where each node is associated with a timestamp, we focus on the task of Semi-Supervised Node Classification (SSNC), aiming to classify recent nodes using labels of past nodes. Temporal dependencies in node connections create domain shifts, causing significant performance degradation when applying models trained on historical data into recent data. Given the practical relevance of this scenario, addressing domain adaptation in chronological split data is crucial, yet underexplored. We propose Imposing invariance with Message Passing in Chronological split Temporal Graphs (IMPACT), a method that imposes invariant properties based on realistic assumptions derived from temporal graph structures. Unlike traditional domain adaptation approaches which rely on unverifiable assumptions, IMPACT explicitly accounts for the characteristics of chronological splits. The IMPACT is further supported by rigorous mathematical analysis, including a derivation of an upper bound of the generalization error. Experimentally, IMPACT achieves a 3.8% performance improvement over current SOTA method on the ogbn-mag graph dataset.

For instance, in academic citation network, each paper node may contain information regarding the year of its publication. The focus of this study lies within such graph data, particularly on datasets where the train and test splits are arranged in chronological order. In other words, the separation between nodes available for training and those targeted for inference occurs temporally, requiring the classification of the labels of nodes with the most recent timestamp based on the labels of nodes with historical timestamp. While leveraging GNNs trained on historical data to classify newly added nodes is a common scenario in industrial and research settings (Liu et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2020; Pareja et al., 2020), systematic research on effectively utilizing temporal information within chronological split graphs remains scarce.\nFailure to appropriately utilize temporal information can lead to significant performance degradation when the model attempts to classify labels of recent data.

Spatial GNNs, such as GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), GAT (Velickovic et al., 2017) and HGNN (Feng et al., 2019), derive topological information by aggregating information from neighboring nodes through message passing.\n$\\mathcal{M}_{v}^{(k+1)} \\leftarrow \\text{AGG}(\\{X_{u}^{(k)}, \\forall u \\in \\mathcal{N}_{v}\\})$\n(1)\n$\\mathcal{X}_{v}^{(k+1)} \\leftarrow \\text{COMBINE}(\\{\\mathcal{X}_{v}^{(k)}, \\mathcal{M}_{v}^{(k+1)}\\}), \\forall v \\in V, k < K$\n(2)\nHere, $K$ is the number of GNN layers, $\\mathcal{X}_{v}^{(0)} = X_v$ is initial feature vector of each node, and the final representation $\\mathcal{X}_{v}^{(K)} = Z_v$ serves as the input to the node-wise classifier. The AGG function performs topological aggregation by collecting information from neighboring nodes, while the COMBINE function performs semantic aggregation through processing the collected message for each node. Scalability is a crucial issue when applying GNNs to massive graphs. Ego graph, which defines the scope of information influencing the classification of a single node, exponentially increases with the number of GNN layers. Therefore, to ensure scalability, algorithms must be meticulously designed to efficiently utilize computation and memory resources (Hamilton et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2019). Decoupled GNNs, whose process of collecting topological information occurs solely during preprocessing and is parameter-free, such as SGC (Wu et al., 2019), SIGN (Rossi et al., 2020), and GAMLP (Zhang et al., 2022), have demonstrated outstanding performance and scalability on many real-world datasets. Furthermore, SeHGNN (Yang et al., 2023) and RpHGNN (Hu et al., 2023) propose decoupled GNNs that efficiently apply to heterogeneous graphs by constructing separate embedding spaces for each metapath based on HGNN (Feng et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "2.2 DOMAIN ADAPTATION", "content": "A machine will learn from a train domain in order to perform on a test domain.

SR-GNN (Zhu et al., 2021) adjusts the distribution distance of representations using a regularizer, with computational complexity proportional to the square of the number of nodes, making it challenging to apply to large graphs.

While it may seem straightforward to compute and align the mean and variance for each label, this is impractical in real settings since test labels are unknown during prediction.

Therefore, PMP will be used as the 1st moment alignment method in the subsequent discussions.

Here, $W_1$ is the Wasserstein-1 metric of probability measures. We also assume G-Lipschitz condition for semantic aggregation functions, $f^{(k)}, \\forall k \\in \\{1,2,..., K\\}$. Detailed modelling of PMP with probability measures are in Appendix A.7, and proofs of the following theorems are in Appendix A.8. For now on, we will omit the details and only state the theorems and provide interpretations of the theoretical results.\nTheorem 4.3. $W_1(m_{y,t}^{(k)}, m_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq O(C^{1/3}V^{1/3})$\nTheorem 4.4. If $m_{y,t}^{(k)}$ is sub-Gaussian with constant $\\tau$, then $W_1(m_{y,t}^{(k)}, m_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq O(\\tau \\sqrt{\\log C})$. Without PMP, we can only guarantee $W_1(m_{y,t}^{(k)}, m_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq 2C$, or $O(C)$. However, PMP gives a tighter upper bound $O(C^{1/3}V^{1/3})$. Furthermore, with additional assumption of sub-Gaussians, PMP gives a more significant upper bound $O(\\tau \\sqrt{\\log C})$.\nTheorem 4.5. If $\\forall y \\in \\mathcal{Y}, \\forall t,t' \\in T, W_1(m_{y,t}^{(k)}, m_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq W$, then for $\\forall y \\in \\mathcal{Y}, \\forall t,t' \\in T$, $W_1(\\mathcal{M}_{y,t}^{(k+1)}, \\mathcal{M}_{y,t'}^{(k+1)}) < \\frac{W}{G^{(k)}}$ where $G^{(k)} > 1$ is a constant only depending on the layer k.\nThis theorem involves two steps. First, $W_1(m_{y,t}^{(k)}, m_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq W$ gives $W_1(\\mathcal{X}_{y,t}^{(k)}, \\mathcal{X}_{y,t'}^{(k)}) < GW$. Second, $W_1(\\mathcal{X}_{y,t}^{(k)}, \\mathcal{X}_{y,t'}^{(k)}) \\leq GW$ gives $W_1(\\mathcal{M}_{y,t}^{(k+1)}, \\mathcal{M}_{y,t'}^{(k+1)}) \\leq \\frac{W}{G^{(k)}}$ for $G^{(k)} > 1$, a constant only depending on the layer k. The strength of this inequality is that the denominator $G^{(k)}$ is larger than 1. For example, if we assume 1-Lipschitz property of aggregation functions, the upper bound of $W_1$ distance decreases layer by layer. The following corollary formulates this interpretation.\nCorollary 4.5.1. Under previous assumptions, for $\\forall y \\in \\mathcal{Y}, \\forall t \\in T, W_1(\\mathcal{M}_{y,t}^{(K)}, \\mathcal{M}_{y,t'}^{(K)}) \\leq \\frac{W}{G^{(1)}G^{(2)}...G^{(K-1)}} \\leq O(\\min\\{C^{1/3}V^{1/3},\\tau\\sqrt{\\log C}\\})$\nTherefore, we ensured that the $W_1$ distance between train and test distributions of final representations are bounded when PMP is applied in multi-layer GNNs. In Section 2.2, we have previously introduced that the generalization error can be upper bounded by the $W_1$ distance. Hence, we have established a theoretical upper bound of the generalization error when PMP method is applied."}, {"title": "4.4 GENERALIZED PMP: GENPMP", "content": "Here, we note that the first moment is a good approximation for the mean only when the number of nodes with specific time label are similar to each other. Hence, if the dataset has a substantial difference among the number of nodes with specific time label, duplicating the single nodes as PMP will still adjust the 1st moment, but this will not be a good approximation for the mean. Therefore, we propose the Generalized PMP (GenPMP) for such datasets.\nFor the target node $v$ with time $t$, consider the time $\\tilde{t}$ of some neighboring node. Instead of $\\mathcal{T}_{double}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{single}$, we define $\\mathcal{T}_{\\Delta} = \\{\\tilde{t} \\in \\mathcal{T} | |\\tilde{t} - t| = \\Delta\\}$ for $0 \\leq \\Delta \\leq |t_{max} - t|$.

Unlike PMP which distinguishes neighbor nodes into only two classes, this method explicitly counts the nodes and adjusts the shape of distributions among train and test data. However, GenPMP has reduced adaptability. Unlike PMP, which can be implemented by simply adding or removing edges in the graph, GenPMP requires modifying the model to reflect real-valued edge weights during the message passing process. Moreover, when the number of nodes per timestamp is equal, GenPMP behaves similarly to PMP.

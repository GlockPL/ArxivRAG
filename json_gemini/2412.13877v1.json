To achieve\neffective generalization, it is essential to construct comprehen-\nsive datasets that encompass a large number of demonstration\ntrajectories and diverse tasks. Unlike vision or language data\nthat can be collected from the Internet, robotic datasets require\ndetailed observations and manipulation actions, necessitating\nsignificant investment in hardware-software infrastructure and\nhuman labor. While existing works have focused on assembling\nvarious individual robot datasets, there remains a lack of a\nunified data collection standard and insufficient diversity in\ntasks, scenarios, and robot types. In this paper, we introduce\nRoboMIND (Multi-embodiment Intelligence Normative Data for\nRobot manipulation), featuring 55k real-world demonstration\ntrajectories across 279 diverse tasks involving 61 different object\nclasses. RoboMIND is collected through human teleoperation and\nencompasses comprehensive robotic-related information, includ-\ning multi-view RGB-D images, proprioceptive robot state infor-\nmation, end effector details, and linguistic task descriptions. To\nensure dataset consistency and reliability during policy learning,\nRoboMIND is built on a unified data collection platform and stan-\ndardized protocol, covering four distinct robotic embodiments:\nthe Franka Emika Panda, the UR-5e, the AgileX dual-arm robot,\nand the Tien Kung humanoid robot with dual dexterous hands.\nIn addition, we create a digital twin environment in the Isaac\nSim simulator, featuring the same tasks and assets as our real-\nworld dataset. This simulation environment not only facilitates\nthe low-cost collection of additional training data but also enables\nefficient evaluation. We provide a thorough quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of RoboMIND across multiple dimensions,\noffering detailed insights into the diversity of our datasets. In\nour experiments, we conduct extensive real-world testing with\nfour state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, demonstrating\nthat training with RoboMIND data results in a high manipulation\nsuccess rate and strong generalization. In addition, investigations\nof failure reasons reveal promising directions for improvement.\nOur project is at https://x-humanoid-robomind.github.io/.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "One of the aspirations of any professional in the field of\nrobotics is to develop a versatile, general-purpose robotic\nmodel capable of performing a broad spectrum of real-world\ntasks. Specifically, such models should be generalizable in\norder to execute the intended manipulation tasks under varying\nconditions, such as a new robot, unfamiliar environments, or\ndifferent objects [42, 43, 64, 54, 53, 11]. \u03a4o achieve this level\nof generalization, researchers have drawn inspiration from\nthe training of large models in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing, where rich and diverse datasets have\nproven essential [1, 51, 78, 82, 26, 47]. They concluded that\nfor training generalizable robotic models, one of the most\ncritical elements is access to rich and diverse training data\nthat encompass varied scenes, tasks, and robot types. Such\ndiversity ensures that models learn to perform reliably under\ndifferent conditions and environments [11, 25, 58, 79, 64, 74].\nTherefore, in this work, we aim to construct comprehensive\ndatasets that capture a broad spectrum of robotic interactions\nand experiences to facilitate training models capable of\nmastering various manipulation policies.\nHowever, the curation of large-scale datasets for training\ngeneral-purpose robotic models poses significant challenges.\nIn contrast to the acquisition of vision or language data,\nwhich can often be sourced through web-based collection\nmethods [26, 47], collecting robotic data is difficult because\nsuch data cannot be easily obtained via conventional internet\nscraping methodologies, as it requires controlled environments\nwhere the joints and end-effector information of robotic sys-\ntems are meticulously recorded. Moreover, scaling up data\ncollection efforts necessitates considerable investment in both\nhardware and software infrastructure and human labor for\noversight, particularly when it comes to acquiring and curating\nhigh-quality demonstration data [83, 42, 64]. Consequently,\neven the most versatile robotic manipulation policies currently\nin use are predominantly trained on datasets gathered within\nconstrained conditions that offer limited diversity in scenarios,\ntasks, and embodiments [64].\nOur dataset, called RoboMIND (Multi-embodiment\nIntelligence Normative Data for Robot manipulation), is\nan extensive dataset that encompasses a broad range of\nrobotic interactions and experiences. RoboMIND features\n55k demonstration trajectories amounting to 308.6 hours of\ninteraction data of 4 kinds of robotic embodiments including\nFranka Emika Panda [28], X-Humanoid Tien Kung [9],\nAgileX Cobot Magic V2.0 [69], and UR-5e [70]. Unlike\nDROID and Open X-Embodiment, which were compiled\nfrom various laboratories with differing data collection\nstandards and diverse combinations of robotic platforms,\nRoboMIND is gathered within the same standardized setting,\nadhering to a standardized data collection protocol to ensure\nconsistency and reliability. By maintaining uniform data\ncollection standards, all data points are captured under similar\nconditions, reducing variability and noise, which is crucial for\ntraining models that can generalize well across different tasks\nand environments. The standardized procedures also enhance\nthe reliability of the dataset, making it easier to validate and\nreproduce experimental results, thereby building trust in the\ntrained models and ensuring their consistent performance in\nreal-world applications."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Robotic Manipulation. Traditional manipulation policies\ntypically rely on state-based reinforcement learning [3, 38, 90].\nIn contrast, recent works [23, 61, 24] incorporate visual\nobservations as input to predict action poses. Imitation learn-\ning policies, in particular, enable robots to acquire stable\nmanipulation skills by imitating an expert through demon-\nstration [20, 85, 91]. Driven by advancements in diffusion-\nbased generative models [34, 71, 77], diffusion policy [12]\nand subsequent works [66, 68, 86] focus on transforming\nrandom Gaussian noise into coherent action sequences, with\nmethods such as DP3 [92] and 3D Diffuser Actor [41] further\nenhancing this process in 3D space. On the other hand, some\nmultimodal large language models (LLMs)[2, 21, 36] enable\nrobots to comprehend natural language and visual scenes, auto-\nmatically generating task plans. Meanwhile, vision-language-\naction (VLA) models [95, 50, 49, 53, 43] empower LLMs to\npredict low-level SE(3) poses, demonstrating interpretability\nand generalization in diverse scenarios. Given the critical\nrole of 3D spatial information in complex manipulation tasks,\nseveral works [94, 29, 76, 27] explore the encoding of point\ncloud data or multi-view images for 3D imitation learning.\nHowever, most existing methods are trained on simulation\ndatasets or self-collected real-world datasets, and the robotics\ncommunity still lacks a unified large-scale dataset.\nRobotic Learning Datasets. Interacting with spatial con-\nfigurations in real-world environments is vital for robots.\nHowever, collecting data with a real robotic arm often incurs\nsubstantial costs [42, 64]. General-purpose simulators [63,\n55, 15, 44] replicate the physical world and provide vir-\ntual environments for training policy models, significantly\nreducing the costs and time associated with data collection.\nTo meet the training demands of complex and long-horizon\ntasks, simulators based on real-world environments are de-\nveloped [45, 10, 89, 72], featuring photorealistic 3D assets\nand scenes built with game engines. However, the Sim-to-\nReal gap significantly impacts the manipulation accuracy of\nimitation learning policies. As a result, some research shifts\ntowards directly collecting real-world data, including datasets\ngathered through automated scripts or expert agents [8, 18,\n32, 39, 46, 67], as well as those obtained via human teleop-\neration [6, 7, 22, 25, 37, 58, 75, 81]."}, {"title": "III. DATASET SETUP", "content": "In this work, we introduce the RoboMIND dataset. This data\nset comprises data from four different robotic embodiments,\ntotaling 55k trajectories on 279 tasks, 61 different object\nclasses, and 36 operational skills. To support the development\nof such a large-scale dataset, we established a comprehen-\nsive data collection process, which we continuously refine.\nCurrently, this data collection process involves three core\ncomponents: 1) A teleoperation system enabling operators to\ncontrol robotic arms in real time. 2) An internally developed\nintelligent data platform for efficient data collection, manage-\nment, processing, and analysis. 3) A quality assurance process\nto filter high-quality data for downstream applications.\nTeleoperation System. The data are collected through tele-\noperation. Unlike the mechanical motion data typically gath-\nered via scripted collection, our data is more natural, coherent,\nand smooth, closely mirroring human behavior and cognition.\nFor Franka, UR-5e, and Simulation robots, we followed the\nsetup described in Gello [87], creating corresponding homol-\nogous teleoperation devices and control systems. For AgeliX\nrobots, we utilized the built-in dual-arm teleoperation system.\nFor Tien Kung humanoid robots, we collected data using\nboth Xsens motion capture suits and Gello-style teleoperation\ndevices. All data gathering occurs in designated internal areas,\nwith minimal personnel rotation. This consistency helps main-\ntain a harmonious collection rhythm and adheres to internal\nstandards, thereby enhancing the quality of the dataset.\nIntelligent Data Platform. As the volume of collected\ndata grows, efficient recording, transmission, management,\nand analysis become significant challenges. We developed an\nintelligent data platform to support the design and development\nof embodied intelligent systems. This platform uses a cloud-\nnative architecture and distributed computing to handle large-\nscale data processing, offering four main functionalities and\ntheir corresponding modules: 1) Data collection (real-time\ndata transfer, collection device management). 2) Data storage\n(petabyte-scale storage, structured and unstructured support).\n3) Data management (cleaning, quality assessment, version\ncontrol). 4) Data processing and analysis.\nData Quality Assurance. Since all data stems from opera-\ntors controlling the system in real time, errors may arise due\nto physical limitations, such as fatigue, habits, distractions, or\nexternal disruptions. To mitigate this, we employ a rotation\nsystem for operators and strive to provide a comfortable\nenvironment to keep them focused. Additionally, we perform\nquality checks on all collected data to ensure its reliability.\nWe define quality assurance criteria, such as unnecessary\ncontacts and repeated grabbing. The quality assurance process\ncomprises three steps: 1) Initial Inspection: Quickly review\nvideos to ensure no obvious technical issues, e.g., frame loss\nand freezing. 2) Detailed Inspection: Frame-by-frame or slow-\nmotion analysis to verify compliance with the criteria. 3) Data\nFiltering and Issue Logging: Document specific timestamps\nand descriptions for non-compliant data and categorize it for\nfurther processing or improvement.\nWe adopted a task-centric data collection protocol, where\neach task serves as the fundamental unit of the dataset. In\nRoboMIND, a task is comprehensively defined by four key\ncomponents: (1) the specific robotic embodiment utilized, (2)\nthe manipulation skill being executed, (3) the objects involved\nin the task, and (4) detailed scene descriptions, including\nobject positions, spatial relationships, and environmental con-\nstraints or interfering elements. This structured task-based\nframework ensures systematic data collection and enables fine-\ngrained analysis of robotic manipulation capabilities across\ndifferent scenarios and tasks."}, {"title": "IV.

In\nthis section, we provide a comprehensive quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of RoboMIND across various dimensions.\nWe believe this analysis can offer valuable insights into Robo-\nMIND and identify opportunities for further improvement and\ninvestigation."}, {"title": "A. Quantitative Analysis", "content": "Heterogeneous Embodiments. Figure 1(a) shows the dis-\ntribution of trajectories for each embodiment in our dataset,\nwhich includes four distinct types: Franka, AgileX, Tien Kung,\nand UR. Franka constitutes 55.7% of the total trajectories,\nwith over 11,000 simulation-based and 19,000 real-world\ntrajectories collected via human teleoperation. The other three\nembodiments include real-world demonstrations only. The\nheterogeneous set of embodiments enables the design and\nexecution of a wide range of tasks, including both single-arm\nand dual-arm manipulations. Notably, Tien Kung accounts for\n17.4% of the trajectories. These dual-arm data enhance the\ndataset's diversity and complexity, supporting the training of\ncoordination skills or more complex long-horizon tasks.\nTask Classification. Unlike other datasets that categorize\ntasks based on verbs or skills [42], we categorize tasks\nusing the context of natural language descriptions, considering\nvarious axes such as skills, objects, and trajectory horizons.\nEach trajectory may belong to multiple task types, and only\nthe major type for each trajectory is counted.\nAs shown in Figure 1(c), all tasks are categorized into six\ntypes: 1) Articulated Manipulations (Artic. M.): Involve\nopening, closing, turning on, or turning off objects with\narticulated joints. 2) Coordination Manipulations (Coord.\nM.): Require coordination between robot arms. 3) Basic\nManipulations (Basic M.): Include basic skills such as\ngrasping, holding, and placing. 4) Object Interactions (Obj.\nInt.): Involve interacting with multiple objects, for example,\npushing one cube across another. 5) Precision Manipula-\ntions (Precision M.): Necessary when objects are difficult\nto grasp or target areas are limited, such as pouring liquid\ninto a cup or inserting a battery. 6) Scene Understanding\n(Scene U.): Major challenges related to understanding the\nscene, like closing the upper drawer from the right side or\nplacing four large blocks of different colors into corresponding\ncolored boxes. Using fine-grained classification, we show that\nRoboMIND enhances task diversity by introducing various\ntask types beyond basic manipulations. This challenges the\ngeneralization of manipulation policies from multiple aspects,\nsuch as scene understanding and precision manipulation.\nDiverse Objects. RoboMIND includes over 60 object types\nfrom five usage scenarios, as shown in Figure 1(d), covering\nmost daily life settings: domestic, industrial, kitchen, office,\nand retail. To provide a detailed overview, we summarize\ntrajectories for all objects categorized by usage scenario in\nFigure 2. In the kitchen, the dataset includes common foods\nsuch as strawberries, eggs, bananas, and pears, as well as com-\nplex articulated objects like oven doors and bread machines.\nDomestic scenarios feature both rigid objects like tennis balls\nand deformable objects like toys. Office and industrial sce-\nnarios include small objects that require precise control, such\nas batteries and gears. This diverse range of objects enhances\nthe dataset's complexity and supports the training of versatile\nmanipulation policies across various environments.\nLong Horizon. We calculated the average task horizon\n(i.e., the number of time steps in one trajectory) for each\nembodiment, as shown in Figure 1(b). Tasks collected by\nFranka and UR have shorter trajectories (under 200 time\nsteps), making them suitable for training primitive skills.\nIn contrast, tasks from Tien Kung and AgileX have longer\ntrajectories (over 500 time steps), which are better suited for\nlong-horizon task training and skill composition.\nFigure 3a displays a histogram of skill counts across tasks\nfor the four embodiments. AgileX tasks typically involve two\nor three combined skills, extending the task horizon. Mean-\nwhile, Tien Kung tasks vary in length, with some comprising\nup to five skills per task. Additionally, we selected an AgileX"}, {"title": "B. Qualitative Analysis", "content": "Compared to Other Datasets. RoboMIND features stan-\ndardized settings to form a large-scale real-world manipulation\ndataset. As shown in Figure 4, we compare our dataset\nwith Open X-Embodiments (OXE), another large-scale robotic\nlearning dataset. Although OXE contains a vast amount of\ndata, the significantly different settings make it difficult to\nlearn efficient manipulation policies across the entire dataset.\nIn contrast, RoboMIND is collected through a carefully de-\nsigned standardized procedure, making it ready-to-use for\nother roboticists. Meanwhile, its heterogeneous embodiments,\ndiverse tasks, and various skills are suitable for training\ngeneralizable policies, whether for primitive skills or long-\nhorizon manipulations.\nLanguage Description Annotation. In RoboMIND, we\nprovide refined linguistic annotations for 10,000 successful\nrobot motion trajectories. The annotation process involves two\nprimary steps. First, we use Gemini [78] to segment each video\nbased on the sequence of operations and generate detailed text\ndescriptions for each segment. These descriptions accurately\ncapture the operational steps and relevant context. Second, we\nmanually refine Gemini's annotations regarding the following\nkey aspects:\n\u2022 Identifying key manipulated objects.\n\u2022 Detecting and describing all critical actions in the video.\n\u2022 Ensuring accurate description of operational details.\n\u2022 Applying reasonable granularity in temporal segmenta-\ntion.\n\u2022 Maintaining consistent temporal logic.\nThis thorough process enhances the precision and reliability\nof the language annotations for the collected trajectories. We\nannotate the video of a Franka Emika Panda arm picking the\napple and placing it in the drawer using the above standard\nprocedure, as shown in Figure 5. The results show that our\nannotation scheme can accurately segment the key actions in\nthe video and provide precise language descriptions of these\nkey actions. More detailed examples of our annotation are\nprovided in the supplementary materials.\nFailure Case Demonstrations. We also release 5k tra-\njectories of some robot motion failure cases. The failure\ncases documented include scenarios where different types of\nhumane operators failed to complete their assigned tasks, as\nwell as instances where robots encountered failures during the\nexecution of operational tasks.\nWe present the visualization examples of these failure cases\nin Figure 6. Specifically, we present two failure cases from the\nFranka and AgileX robots. For the FR-PlacePlateInPlateRack\ntask performed by Franka, a successful execution shows the\nrobotic arm accurately placing a plate into the plate rack."}, {"title": "V.

Experiment Results on Single-task Imitation Learning Mod- els", "content": "For single-task imitation learning model, such as ACT,\nwhich is specifically designed for single-task learning, we\ntrain it from scratch using the RobotMind dataset and directly\ndeploy it on the corresponding real-world tasks. Specifically,\nwe employ ACT [94] and BAKU [33] algorithms, adhering\nto the default model settings recommended in their original\npublications. These experiments are carried out on 45 tasks,\ndistributed as follows: 15 tasks with the Franka robot, 15 tasks\nwith AgileX, 10 tasks with Tien Kung, and 5 tasks with UR-\n5e, which are already explained in detail in the Section V-A.\nFigure 9 presents the performance of ACT and BAKU\nacross 45 tasks using four types of robots, evaluated in\nterms of the success rate. In Figure 9, we find that ACT\nachieve an average success rate of 55.3% across 15 tasks\non AgileX, outperforming Franka (30.7%), UR-5e (38.0%),\nand Tien Kung (34.0%). The experiment results indicate that\nthe ACT algorithm achieves at least one successful task\ncompletion on the majority of tasks, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of the approach, as well as the accuracy of the\nvisual perception and robotic joint information provided by the\nRoboMIND. Additionally, ACT also shows promising results\non several Tien Kung tasks, including a 60% success rate\non TK-CloseDrawerLowerCabinet. These results not\nonly illustrate that ACT shows robust performance in complex\ndexterous hand manipulation tasks but also underscore the high\nquality of data gathered in RobotMind. Therefore, we believe\nthat the single-arm, dual-arm, and dexterous hand datasets\nin the RoboMIND can serve as high-quality training sets to\nimprove the performance of single-task imitation learning,\nthereby advancing the development of the entire VLA imi-\ntation learning field.\nOn the other hand, BAKU exhibit lower success rates across\nmost tasks. This discrepancy could be attributed to the use of\nhyper-parameter settings from the original BAKU paper, which\nis primarily optimized for simulation environments rather than\nreal-world robotic platforms. The significant gap between\nsimulation and real-world environments underscores the chal-\nlenges in directly transferring models from simulated settings\nto physical robots. It highlights the necessity for researchers\nto carefully fine-tune hyper-parameters and potentially adjust\nthe network architecture to achieve optimal performance in\nreal-world applications.

We can find that RDT-1B fine-tuned on\ntask-specific expert data from RoboMIND performs markedly\nbetter than those attempting direct zero-shot generalization to\nunseen real-world tasks. Especially, for simple tasks, such\nas placing an apple on a blue plate, the fine-tuning RDT-\n1B model results in a significantly high experimental success\nrate.

Especially, for\nthe RDT-1B model, we amalgamate the datasets from four\ndistinct tasks derived from Query 1 to fine-tune the RDT-1B\nmodel. Subsequently, we conduct an individual assessment of\nthe model's success rate on each of the four tasks.

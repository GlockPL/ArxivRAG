However, the content generated by LLMs often lacks accuracy and interpretability (Zhang et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2024b). To address these challenges, one approach is leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance LLMs (Yang et al., 2023b, 2024a). By prompting the structured KG knowledge to LLMs, they can generate more reliable content. Additionally, KG-enhanced LLMs can be applied to various KG tasks as well, including graph completion, reasoning and more (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023).\nIn Fig 1, we demonstrate an example in the educational scenario. A user asks a question involving specific concepts (highlighted in blue). Ideally, the response should reflect the relations between these concepts, essentially outlining the learning path that connects them. However, without a knowledge system, an LLM might offer answers that are somewhat relevant but too general, including broad concepts like \"Basic NLP Foundations\", or it may introduce confusing concepts with inaccurate specificity (\"Corpora and Datasets\"). In contrast, when equipped with a knowledge system (such as a concept graph showing prerequisite relations) and supplemented with relevant in-domain texts, the response becomes more refined, reflecting a deeper understanding of the concept relations.\nAutomatic methods have been applied to knowledge graph construction (KGC) (Sheng et al., 2022; Baek et al., 2023; Carta et al., 2023), with most of them employing a localized perspective, extracting triplets at the sentence or paragraph level, which is suitable for shallow knowledge, such as (people, belong_to, organization). However, this localized approach often fails to capture the comprehensive and interconnected nature of knowledge. The accuracy and completeness of triplets can be significantly limited when sourced from isolated segments of text, which is essential for scientific graphs containing deep knowledge.\nRecognizing this limitation, we propose a significant paradigm shift towards a global view in KGC. Our approach includes a graph fusion module that extracts candidate triplets and performs global merging and resolution across multiple sources. Specifically, we leverage LLMs not only for extraction but also for critical knowledge integration, marking the first initiative to utilize LLMs for such a comprehensive merging process. We believe that this global perspective is crucial for constructing more accurate and holistic KGs, as it allows for the consideration of broader contexts and relations that span beyond single documents. Similarly, this is particularly vital in scientific KGs, where the relations between complex concepts cannot be adequately understood by examining individual sentences.\nIn this study, we utilize LLMs to construct and fuse scientific KGs, focusing primarily on the domain of natural language processing. Most importantly, we apply the constructed KG in the educational question-answering (QA) scenario. Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we propose the Graphusion framework, which allows zero-shot KGC from free text. The core graph fusion component incorporates entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. Evaluation results show that Graphusion achieves scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 for entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively, demonstrating its potential for automatic and large-scale KGC. To the best of our knowledge, our work is pioneering in scientific KGC with fusion using the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs. Second, we present TutorQA, a QA benchmark featuring six diverse tasks and comprising 1,200 expert-verified, NLP-centric QA pairs designed to mimic college-level tutoring questions. Third, we develop a pipeline to enhance the interaction between LLMs and the concept graph for TutorQA, achieving significant results across all tasks. All the code and data can be found in https://github.com/IreneZihuiLi/CGPrompt."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Knowledge Graph Construction KGC aims to create a structured representation of knowledge in the form of a KG. Research on KGs spans various domains, including medical, legal, and more (Vrande\u010di\u0107 and Kr\u00f6tzsch, 2014; Li et al., 2020; Le-Tuan et al., 2022; Kalla et al., 2023; Ahrabian et al., 2023). Typically, KGC involves several methods such as entity extraction and link prediction (Luan et al., 2018; Reese et al., 2020), with a significant focus on supervised learning. Recently, LLMs have been utilized in KGC relying on their powerful zero-shot capabilities (Zhu et al., 2023; Carta et al., 2023). Although relevant works propose pipelines for extracting knowledge, they often remain limited to localized extraction, such as at the sentence or paragraph level. In contrast, our work focuses on shifting from a local perspective to a global one, aiming to generate a more comprehensive KG.\nEducational NLP Modern NLP and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to a wide range of applications, with education being a significant area. For instance, various tools have been developed focusing on writing assistance, language study, automatic grading, and quiz generation (Seyler et al., 2015; Gonz\u00e1lez-Carrillo et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2023). Moreover, in educational scenarios, providing responses to students still requires considerable effort, as the questions often demand a high degree of relevance to the study materials and strong domain knowledge. Consequently, many studies have concentrated on developing automatic QA models (Zylich et al., 2020; Hicke et al., 2023), which tackle a range of queries, from logistical to knowledge-based questions. In this work, we integrate an LLM-constructed KG for various QA tasks in NLP education."}, {"title": "Graphusion Framework", "content": "In this section, we introduce our Graphusion Framework for scientific KGC.\nProblem Definition\nA KG is defined as a set of triplets: $KG = {\\{(h_i, r_i,t_i) | h_i,t_i \\in E, r_i \\in R, i = 1, 2, . . ., n}\\}$, where: E is the set of entities, R is the set of possible relations, and n is the total number of triplets in the KG. The task of zero-shot KGC involves taking a set of free text T and generating a list of triplets (h,r,t). Optionally, there is an expert-annotated KG EG as input, in order to provide some existing knowledge. In our setting, the number of triplets of KG is much larger than EG. We select the domain to be NLP, so the entities are concepts only, other entity types such as people, organizations are not our focus. Following previous works (Luan et al., 2018), we define 7 relations types: Prerequisite_of, Used_for, Compare, Conjunction, Hyponym_of, Evaluate_for and Part_OF.\nZero-shot Link Prediction\nWhile the task of KGC is to generate a list of triplets, including entities and their corresponding relations, we start with a simpler setting: focusing solely on link prediction for pre-defined entity pairs and a single relation type. This setting helps us understand the capabilities of LLMs on scientific KGC under a zero-shot setting. Specifically, given a concept pair (A, B), the task of link prediction is to determine if a relationship r exists. We choose r =Prerequisite_of. For instance, the relation \"Viterbi Algorithm\" \u2192 \"POS Tagging\" implies that to learn the concept of \"POS Tagging,\" one must first understand the \"Viterbi Algorithm.\" Initially, a predefined set of concepts C is given.\nLP Prompt We then design a Link Prediction (LP) Prompt to solve the task. The core part is to provide the domain name, the definition and description of the dependency relation to be predicted, and the query concepts. Meanwhile, we explore whether additional information, such as concept definitions from Wikipedia and neighboring concepts from training data (when available), would be beneficial. The LP Prompt is as follows:\nWe have two {domain} related concepts:\nA: {concept_1} and B: {concept_2}.\nDo you think learning {concept_1}\nwill help in understanding {concept_2}?\nHints:\n1. Answer YES or NO only.\n2. This is a directional relation,\nwhich means if the answer is \"YES\",\n(B, A) is false, but (A, B) is true.\n3. Your answer will be used to create a\nknowledge graph.\n{Additional Information}\nGraphusion: Zero-shot Knowledge Graph Construction\nWe now introduce our Graphusion framework for constructing scientific KGs. Our approach addresses three key challenges in zero-shot KGC: 1) the input consists of free text rather than a predefined list of concepts; 2) the relations encompass multiple types, and conflicts may exist among them; and 3) the output is not a single binary label but a list of triplets, making evaluation more challenging.\nStep 1: Seed Concept Generation Extracting domain-specific concepts using LLMs under a zero-shot setting is highly challenging due to the absence of predefined concept lists. This process is not only resource-intensive but also tends to generate a large number of irrelevant concepts, thereby compromising the quality of extraction. To address these issues, we adopt a seed concept generation approach for efficiently extracting in-domain concepts from free text (Ke et al., 2024). Specifically, we utilize BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022) for topic modeling to identify representative concepts for each topic. These representative concepts serve as seed concepts, denoted as Q. The initialized seed concepts ensure high relevance in concept extraction and provide certain precision for subsequent triplet extraction.\nStep 2: Candidate Triplet Extraction Based on these seed concepts, in Step 2, we begin extracting candidate triplets from the free text. Each time, we input a concept $q \\in Q$ ({query}) as the query concept and retrieve documents containing this concept ({context}) through information retrieval. Our goal is to extract any potential triplets that include this query concept. To achieve this, we design a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) prompt. We first instruct the LLMs to extract in-domain concepts, then identify the possible relations between those concepts and q. Then, we ask LLMs to discover novel triplets, even if q is not initially included. This approach ensures that the seed concepts play a leading role in guiding the extraction of in-domain concepts. Meanwhile, the candidate triplets will encompass novel concepts. We design the Extraction Prompt to be the following:\nGiven a context {context}, and a query\nconcept {query}, do the following:\n1. Extract the query concept and\nin-domain concepts from the context,\nwhich should be fine-grained...\n2. Determine the relations between\nthe query concept and the extracted\nconcepts, in a triplet format:\n(<head concept>, <relation>, <tail\nconcept>)...\n{Relation Definition}\n3. Please note some relations are\nstrictly directional...\n4. You can also extract triplets from\nthe extracted concepts, and the\nquery concept may not be necessary\nin the triplets.\nAfter processing all the queries from the seed concept list, we save all the candidate triplets. We denote this zero-shot constructed KG by the LLM as $ZS - KG$.\nStep3: Knowledge Graph Fusion The triplets extracted in the previous step provide a local view rather than a global perspective of each queried concept. Due to the limitations of context length, achieving a global view is challenging. Additionally, the relations extracted between two concepts can sometimes be conflicting, diverse, or incorrect, such as (neural summarization methods, Used-for, abstractive summarization) and (neural summarization methods, Hyponym-of, abstractive summarization). To address the aforementioned challenge, we propose the Fusion step. This approach helps reconcile conflicting relations, integrate diverse or incorrect relations effectively, and ultimately provides a global understanding of an entity pair.\nSpecifically, for each query concept q, we first query from $ZS - KG$, and obtain a sub-graph that contains q:\n$LLM-KG = {\\{(h, r,t) \\in ZS-KG | h = q or t = q}\\}$.\nOptionally, if there is an expert-annotated KG available, we will also query a sub-graph, marked as $E - G$. Moreover, we conduct a dynamic retrieval of q again from the free text ({background}), to help LLMs to have a better understanding on how to resolve the conflicted triplets. This key fusion step focuses on three parts: a) entity merging: merge semantically similar entities, i.e., NMT vs neural machine translation; b) conflict resolution: for each entity pair, resolve any conflicts and choose the best one; and c) novel triplet inference: propose new triplet from the background text. We utilize the following Fusion Prompt:\nPlease fuse two sub-knowledge graphs\nabout the concept \"{concept}\".\nGraph 1: {LLM-KG} Graph 2: {E-G}\nRules for Fusing the Graphs:\n1. Union the concepts and edges.\n2. If two concepts are similar, or refer\nto the same concept, merge them into\none concept, keeping the one that is\nmeaningful or specific\n3. Only one relation is allowed between\ntwo concepts. If there is a conflict,\nread the \"### Background\" to help you\nkeep the correct relation...\n4. Once step 3 is done, consider every\npossible concept pair not covered in\nstep 2. For example, take a concept\nfrom Graph 1, and match it with a\nconcept from Graph 2. Then, please\nrefer to \"### Background\" to\nsummarize\nnew triplets.\n### Background:\n{background}\n{Relation Definition}"}, {"title": "Evaluation", "content": "The evaluation of KGC is challenging since each model generating different triplets from the free text, along with the lack of expert annotations. To address this, we conduct the expert evaluation on the pipeline output. We ask experts to assess both concept entity quality and relation quality, providing ratings ranging from 1 to 3. The former measures the relevance and specificity of the extracted concepts, while the latter evaluates the logical accuracy between concepts. Additionally, we calculate the Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) of the two experts' evaluations using the Kappa score."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Link Prediction\nWe conduct experiments using the LectureBankCD dataset (Li et al., 2021) and report the performance on the NLP domain. LectureBankCD contains up to 322 pre-defined NLP concepts and prerequisite relation labels on the concept pairs.

These methods utilize pre-trained or graph-based models to encode concept embeddings and then perform binary classification to determine the presence of positive or negative edges in given concept pairs. In our LLM-based experiments, we show two main settings: Zero-shot, which employs LP Prompt; and Zero-shot with RAG, which enhances zero-shot with the addition of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method (Krishna, 2023). RAG has shown to improve on existing LLMs on text generation tasks such as QA.\nKnowledge Graph Completion\nTo conduct KGC, we need a large-scale free-text corpus to serve as the knowledge source.

Generally, LLMs demonstrate creativity by answering with novel concepts, which are often composed of more contemporary and fresh words, even though they might not exactly match the words in the concept graph. Consequently, conventional evaluation metrics like keyword matching are unsuitable for these tasks. To address this, we propose the similarity score. This metric calculates the semantic similarity between the concepts in the predicted list $C_{pred}$ and the ground truth list $C_{gold}$. Specifically, as shown in Eq. 1, for a concept m from the predicted list, and a concept n from the ground truth list, we calculate the cosine similarity between their embeddings achieved from pre-trained BERT model (Devlin et al., 2019). We then average these similarity scores to obtain the similarity score.\n$Score = \\frac{\\sum_{m \\in C_{pred}}\\sum_{n \\in C_{gold}} sim(m, n)}{|C_{pred}| \\times |C_{gold}|}$\nBy averaging the similarity scores, the final score provides a comprehensive measure of the overall semantic alignment between the predicted and ground truth concepts.\nHit Rate For Task 5, we employ the classical Hit Rate metric, expressed as a percentage.

The results indicate the introduction of CoT is not improving. We further find that CoT Prompting more frequently results in negative predictions. This finding serves as a drawback for our study, as it somewhat suppresses the performance of our system. This observation highlights the need to balance the impact of CoT on the rigor and complexity of predictions, especially in the context of graph recovery."}, {"title": "Finetuning", "content": "We further explore the impact of finetuning on additional datasets, with results detailed in Table 8. Specifically, we utilize LLaMA2-70b (Touvron et al., 2023), finetuning it on two previously mentioned datasets: TutorialBank and NLP-Papers. Both the zero-shot LLaMA and the finetuned models are employed to generate answers. As these answers are binary (YES or NO), we can calculate both the accuracy and F1 score for evaluation. However, the results indicate that finetuning does not yield positive outcomes. This can be attributed to two potential factors: 1) the poor quality of data, and 2) limited effectiveness in aiding the graph recovery task.

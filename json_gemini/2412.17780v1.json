Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug development and target structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES. Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective sequence design in discrete state spaces.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Peptides possess unique advantages as a therapeutic modality, including their ability to bind to a diverse set of binding motifs without requiring stable binding pockets, making them ideal for targeting structurally diverse protein surfaces [1, 2]. Moreover, their relatively large size and flexible backbone enable them to disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that are central to disease processes, particularly those requiring interactions with larger surface areas [3]. These attributes have driven a surge in interest, with over 33 FDA-approved therapeutic peptides introduced since 2000 and more than 170 in clinical development for diseases ranging from diabetes to cancer [2]. Specifically, peptides are behind one of the most landmark breakthroughs in recent clinical history: GLP-1 receptor agonists like semaglutide and liraglutide, which have transformed the treatment landscape for type-2 diabetes and weight loss [4, 5]. These engineered peptides have achieved remarkable efficacy, following years of meticulous structural and functional optimization [4, 5]. Their success highlights the potential of therapeutic peptides to address complex diseases where more traditional approaches, such as small molecules, often fall short [2].\nAs evidenced by the journey to generate semaglutide and liraglutide [5], peptides containing only the 20 wild-type amino acids have limitations including susceptibility to enzymatic degradation and low membrane permeability [2]. To overcome these limitations, non-natural amino acids (nAAs) containing diverse chemical modifications to the peptide backbone and side chains have been integrated into peptides to enhance their therapeutic properties. For example, selespressin, which contains nAAs at its proteolytic site, has been shown to have a longer plasma half-life than its natural analog [6] and GLP-1 analogs containing the nAA e-Nheptanoyl-l-lysine has demonstrated stronger binding affinity to their target [7, 5]. Furthermore, chemical modifications are commonly used to generate cyclic peptides, with over 99.6% of cyclic peptides containing nAAs [8]. Due to their stable conformation, cyclic peptides have stronger binding affinity and specificity, enhanced membrane permeability, and low degradation [9]. Despite this progress in peptide drug development, designing peptides that effectively engage new therapeutic targets remains a major limitation, with traditional methods involving screening large phage libraries of up to trillions of random amino acid permutations [10, 11]. This motivates the development of generative deep learning models that can effectively learn the space of clinically relevant peptides and sample de novo peptides conditioned with various therapeutic properties, including binding affinity, solubility, and membrane permeability.\nGenerative diffusion models are considered state-of-the-art for de novo binder design, with new models such as RFpeptides even enabling the design of high-resolution macrocyclic peptides given a target structure [12]. However, structure-based models [12-14], or those that require an intermediate structure prediction step [15], rely on stable tertiary conformations of target proteins, precluding the design of peptide binders to disordered and dynamic targets, which drive a sizable portion of diseases [16]. Generative peptide design language models relying only on the target sequence, such as PepPrCLIP [17] and PepMLM [18], have demonstrated robust success on disordered and structurally-diverse targets, but their utilization of only the 20 wild-type amino acids limits these models from sampling from the space of chemically-modified or cyclic peptides, precluding exploitation of the full therapeutic potential of synthetic peptides.\nRecently, discrete generative models have shown incredible promise in areas such as text generation [19-25], image synthesis [19, 21], executable code generation [23], DNA sequence optimization [26, 27, 25], and even protein design [28, 27, 24, 29], but they still face significant limitations in multi-objective-guided generation and optimization. In our case, the challenge lies in simultaneously optimizing for conflicting therapeutic properties, a critical requirement for generating clinically viable peptides [2, 30, 31]. Classifier-based and classifier-free guidance strategies have been explored to steer discrete diffusion objectives toward specific properties [29, 24, 26, 27], yet these approaches often struggle with gradient estimation and the sparsity of quality data in discrete spaces. This motivates the development of methods that can balance diverse objectives while addressing the unique challenges of discrete peptide generation.\nIn this work, we introduce PepTune, a multi-objective-guided discrete diffusion model for de novo peptide design. PepTune incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based guidance framework to condition a Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) [22], pre-trained on a large dataset of chemically-modified and cyclic peptides represented as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings [32]. However, because the vast majority of SMILES strings are neither chemically valid or nor represent synthesizable peptides, de novo sampling from the space of therapeutically relevant peptide SMILES is virtually impossible. By conditioning on synthesizability, PepTune specifically enables the generation of valid peptide SMILES containing both non-natural amino acids (nAAs) and cyclic structures while achieving Pareto-optimal solutions across multiple therapeutic properties. Our results highlight PepTune's unique capability to balance diverse objectives, setting a new standard for property-conditioned sequence generation.\nOur contributions are as follows:"}, {"title": null, "content": "Masked Diffusion Language Model for Discrete Sampling of Peptide SMILES. We introduce the first Masked Diffusion Language Model (MDLM) with a RoFormer backbone for de novo generation of peptide SMILES sequences that is capable of generating valid and diverse chemically-modified and cyclic peptides that cannot be encoded with canonical amino acid sequences.\nState-Dependent Masking Schedule. Since the presence of peptide bonds is a fundamental component of all valid peptides, we introduce a novel state-dependent masking schedule that masks peptide bond tokens at a slower rate at earlier time steps in the forward diffusion process than non-peptide bonds. We demonstrate that our masking schedule increases the weight of the negative log-loss associated with peptide bond tokens in a time-dependent manner and results in earlier unmasking of peptide bond tokens in the reverse diffusion process.\nGlobal Sequence Invalidity Loss. Since the vast majority of SMILES sequences do not translate into valid peptides, we introduce an invalid loss that penalizes predicted token probabilities where the argmax token sequence is not a valid peptide SMILES. Since the argmax function is not differentiable, we scale the penalty score by the softmax probability of the sampled token. This objective smoothly propagates the penalty from a single discrete sequence to the smooth token probability distributions through gradient updates without the need for complex techniques like straight-through gradient estimators.\nMCTS for Robust Classifier-Based Multi-Objective Guidance. We propose a novel classifier-based multi-objective guidance strategy for discrete diffusion based on the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that selects a sequence of optimal unmasking steps based on preceding iterations, samples a new set of unmasked sequences to compute their objective scores, and finally back-propagates the scores in the path and updates a set of global Pareto-optimal sequences. This strategy balances exploration of the peptide space through the pre-trained MDLM and multi-objective guidance through the MCTS guidance to enable the discovery of a set of valid Pareto-optimal peptide sequences. We also provide a case study for a time-dependent multi-objective guidance strategy to enable prioritization of properties.\nPeptide SMILES Property Prediction Toolkit. To supplement our multi-objective guidance strategy, we train a suite of classification and regression models for property-prediction given peptide SMILES input. We train regression models to predict binding affinity to a protein target using cross-multi-head attention and membrane permeability (log Pexp) using boosted trees. In addition, we train boosted trees for logistic regression of solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling."}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "2.1 Unconditional Generator of Peptide SMILES with Masked Discrete Diffusion\nGiven the immense success of masked language models (MLMs) in learning bidirectional relationships of sequential data [33], including peptide-protein interaction [18], we explore the recent Masked Diffusion Language Model (MDLM) formulation (Figure 1) [22]. MDLM is a discrete diffusion architecture that leverages the MLM objective to effectively learn the clean distribution of sequences p(x) by reconstructing clean sequences from sequences corrupted with [MASK] tokens. To train the MDLM, we randomly sample values of t \u2208 Uniform(0, 1) such that each batch is masked for times t ranging evenly between 0 (fully unmasked) and 1 (fully masked). For the forward masking at time t, the token at each position has a $a_t$ probability remaining unchanged and a $(1 - a_t)$ probability of transitioning to a [MASK] token. Therefore, the probability distribution of a single sample assigned time t in the forward diffusion process is given by\n$q(Z_t | x_0) = Cat(z_t; a_t x_0 + (1 - a_t) m)$        (1)\nwhere m is a one-hot encoding vector with 1 at the index of the [MASK] token.\nWe specifically select the MDLM framework as our generative model to explicitly enforce SUBS parameterization such that once a token is unmasked at time t, it remains unmasked at the same state for the remainder of the unmasking process for t \u2192 0. Since slight modifications to the peptide sequence can result in significant alterations to its properties [34], SUBS parametrization allows us to backpropagate rewards from unmasked sequences to earlier unmasking steps that accurately reflect the favorability of the particular unmasking step in generating optimal peptide SMILES sequences."}, {"title": null, "content": "After empirical training, we find that even after convergence to a training loss of 0.59 and validation loss of 1.41, the majority of generated SMILES were invalid peptides due to slight inaccuracies when generating the fundamental peptide backbone formed by peptide bonds between amino acid side chains. Motivated by these findings, we hypothesized that decreasing the masking rate for tokens forming peptide bonds at earlier time steps and masking them at later time steps in the training process would encourage the model to accurately unmask the peptide bonds first during generation before proceeding to fill in side-chain tokens. To this end, we conceptualized a novel state-dependent masking schedule $a_t(x_0)$ such that peptide bond tokens follow a polynomial masking schedule that increases slower for small t and rapidly approaches $a_t$ for t close to 1.\n$a_t(x_0) = \\begin{cases}\n1 - t^w & x_0 = b \\\\\n1 - t & x_0 \\neq b\n\\end{cases}$         (2)\nWith our state-dependent masking scheme, we derive the parameterized reverse diffusion distribution $p_{\\theta}(z_s | z_t)$ that defines the transition from the partially masked sequence $z_t$ at time t to a slightly unmasked sequence $z_s$ at time $s = t - \\tau$ (Appendix B.2).\n$p_{\\theta}(z_s | z_t) =\\begin{cases}\n(\\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{T}} b + 1) x_{\\theta}(z_t, t)_{z_s} + ((\\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{T}} b + 1) x_{\\theta}(z_t, t)_m & z_t = m \\\\\n\\frac{\\tau}{\\sqrt{T}} b + 1 & z_t \\neq m\n\\end{cases}$         (3)\nFurthermore, we derive a continuous-time state-dependent NELBO loss function $\\mathcal{L}_{NELBO}$ (Methods 4.3, Appendix B.3) that scales the loss of incorrect predictions for peptide bond tokens by the exponent w, encouraging the model to predict peptide bond tokens at high confidence."}, {"title": "2.2 PepMDLM Generates Diverse Chemically-Modified and Cyclic Peptides", "content": "To evaluate the unconditional generation quality as a benchmark for our guided generation model, we leverage the Moses metrics [36], including validity, uniqueness, diversity, and similarity to nearest neighbor (SNN) (Methods 4.5), to compare our model with an autoregressive generator of macrocyclic peptides, HELM-GPT [37]. In contrast to HELM-GPT, we use our peptide SMILES validity filter that checks not only that the SMILES string is a valid molecule but also that contains peptide bonds and valid canonical and non-canonical side-chains. Overall, our model shows increased uniqueness and diversity while lower SNN, showing PepMDLM's capability of generating diverse peptides. Despite our lower validity, our model is unique to peptide SMILES, which has much higher granularity than HELM notation (Table 2).\nSince the advantage of SMILES-based representation of peptides lies in its ability to represent chemically-modified and non-natural amino acids (nAAs), we compared the frequency of nAAs in the peptides generated by PepMDLM with the top 100 peptides with the highest log(Pexp) scores measuring lipophilicity in the CycPeptMPDB database [38] that contains a total of 7334 labeled peptide SMILES with permeability scores between -8.0 ($1.0 \\times 10^{-8} cm/s$) and -4.0 ($1.0 \\times 10^{-4} cm/s$) generated from the parallel artificial membrane permeability (PAMPA) assay (Figure 2). We also compared to the dataset of experimentally tested canonical and non-canonical binding peptides from the PepLand dataset [39]. We found that the peptides present in both datasets had an average nAA frequency greater than two per peptide, indicating the significance of nAAs in defining various peptide properties.\nWe show that PepMDLM generates nAAs from a collection of over 200 nAAs from SwissSidechain [40] by passing them through our peptide sequence identification function, SMILES2PEPTIDE (Algorithm 7). This demonstrates PepMDLM's unique ability to design de novo peptides with cyclic and nAA modifications, expanding the search space of therapeutic peptides well beyond any generative model trained on canonical amino acid representations."}, {"title": "2.3 Multi-Objective Guidance on Therapeutic Properties for Discrete Diffusion", "content": "To generate peptides with high clinical potential, they must achieve high binding affinity with a protein target while optimizing for an array of therapeutic properties like membrane permeability to reach intracellular targets, solubility to improve drug-loading, and non-fouling and non-hemolysis to mitigate negative side-effects.\nGuiding the discrete diffusion objective is challenging due to the lack of data on property-specific peptides to train large generative models and the lack of gradients of the discrete sequence space. Although existing strategies have been explored such as gradient estimation and converting to a continuous latent space [23, 26, 27], there has yet to be a robust strategy that operates directly in the discrete space and can scale for various distinct properties without sacrificing performance in any one property.\nTo address this gap, we introduce a classifier-based multi-objective guidance strategy to generate a set of non-dominated peptide SMILES P* using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Figure 3). A sequence is non-dominated when no other sequence has a strictly larger score in one or more objectives while maintaining equal scores for the remaining objectives.\nWe leverage the unique capability of our unconditional MDLM model to sample from the diverse space of peptide SMILES and our trained property classifiers to search the constrained space of peptides with therapeutically optimal properties through an iterative selection, expansion, rollout, and backpropagation loop (Methods 4.4). The PepTune multi-objective guidance framework is defined as follows.\nWe start each iteration from a fully masked sequence zy, defining the root node of the MCTS tree. During the selection step, we traverse an optimal path through the MCTS tree defined as a series of partial unmasking steps that have been previously traversed based on a cumulative reward vector U(zs) (defined in Equation 21), indicating the likelihood that the given step generates a Pareto non-dominated sequence."}, {"title": null, "content": "Upon reaching a terminal leaf node zt defined as a partially masked sequence at time t > 0 that has yet to be further unmasked, we expand the leaf node to explore M different possible unmasking steps by batched Gumbel unmasking (Equation 23), which applies independently sampled Gumbel noise vectors to the token probabilities predicted by the MDLM backbone for sampling each child node zsi for i = 1... M, balancing diversity across unmasking schemes while following the predicted token distribution.\nEach expanded node is unmasked with greedy Gumbel-max sampling to obtain a fully unmasked sequence xs,i. For all i, we compute a K-dimensional score vector for k objectives and compare it with the scores of the current pool of Pareto non-dominated sequences P* to generate a reward vector r(xs,i) \u2208 RK, where the entry rk(xs,i) at index k is a value in [0, 1] indicating the Pareto-optimality of the sequence for the kth objective compared to the current pool of Pareto non-dominated P*.\n$r_k(x_{s,i}) = \\frac{1}{\\vert P^* \\vert} \\sum_{n=1}^{\\vert P^* \\vert} [s_k(x_{s,i}) \\geq s_k(x_n)]$       (4)\nAfter computing the reward vector for all valid sequences generated during rollout, we take the sum of the reward vectors subtracted by a penalty score proportional to the fraction of sampled SMILES that are not peptides and add the resulting K-dimensional vector to the cumulative reward vectors W(zt) of all successor nodes leading to the root node zy, which determines the selection steps of proceeding iterations.\nEven though the selection process favors high-reward unmasking steps, we show that the resulting pool of generated peptides retains similar uniqueness and diversity scores to the unconditional MDLM and the training dataset distribution (Table 3). In addition, after only 20 iterations of the MCTS search algorithm, the fraction of valid peptides reaches 100%."}, {"title": "2.4 Therapeutic Property Prediction for Peptide SMILES", "content": "While several classifiers exist for predicting properties of small-molecule SMILES sequences and amino-acid representations of peptides, there exists a gap in high-quality property models trained specifically on peptide SMILES data.

To demonstrate generalizability, we include targets with known peptide binders such as GLP-1R and TfR and proteins with no known binders, including GFAP, GLAST, and AMHR2. These targets include both receptor proteins involved with active transport pathways as well as intracellular targets where cell membrane permeability is crucial to achieving therapeutic effects. For each target, we condition the generation on the binding affinity score given the target protein sequence along with solubility, hemolysis, non-fouling, and cell membrane permeability for intracellular targets. For external testing and validation, we use Autodock Vina [48] to compute in silico binding affinities of our generated binders (See Methods 4.5)."}, {"title": "Targeting Receptors on the Blood-Brain Barrier.", "content": "The Transferrin receptor (TfR) is a receptor protein abundant on the selectively permeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) that is responsible for transporting iron-binding transferrin proteins into the brain parenchyma [49]. Given its selective expression on brain endothelial cells and glioma cells and its ability to recycle back to the luminal surface after facilitating the internalization of cargo through the BBB [50], TfR has been extensively studied as a target for the intravenous delivery of various therapeutics and therapeutic nanocarriers through the BBB [51, 52].\nTo generate relevant binders for TfR, we condition PepTune on binding affinity with the TfR sequence, in addition to solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling. At each iteration, we measured the mean of the properties scores across all rolled-out sequences from the selected node to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization strategy. We show that all properties, except solubility, exhibited an upward trend over iterations, with the average score of the binding affinity classifier exhibiting a significant increase in score to over 9.0 (Figure 6B). After plotting the distribution of 100 peptides generated from a single run of PepTune with the minimum number of sequences set to 100, we confirm that our multi-objective MCTS algorithm shifted the distribution to a higher predicted binding affinity than the unconditionally generated peptides (PepMDLM) and the data used to train the binding regression model (Figure 6A). Despite being conditioned on four distinct properties, PepTune is capable of generating higher affinity binders than the unconditional model, supporting the effectiveness of our multi-objective guidance strategy.\nEncouraged by these results, we sampled the Pareto-optimal sequences from the generated peptides and used Vina docking to compute their optimized docking score. Notably, we observed that all of the generated binders that were selected for docking produced affinity scores below -6.0 kcal/mol, with our top-performing binder achieving a -8.4 kcal/mol binding affinity (Figure 6C). From the docking scores, we took the two binders with the best docking scores and visualized their binding conformation with TfR, showing that they bind to distinct motifs on the protein surface (Figure 6B, F, G)."}, {"title": "Targeting GLP-1R.", "content": "Given the significant development of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1R) peptide agonists for the treatment of type-2 diabetes and obesity [4], we compared GLP-1R binding affinity-conditioned peptides generated using PepTune with recent blockbuster GLP-1R agonists: semaglutide and liraglutide. Both semaglutide and liraglutide are over 30 amino acids in length and act by mimicking the binding of natural GLP-1 by binding to the activation pocket of GLP-1R with high precision (Figure 8) [62, 63].\nShorter agonists or antagonists to GLP-1R would serve several benefits to the treatment of insulin-related disorders, including reduced cost and complexity of synthesis, lower immunogenicity, and faster tissue penetration. Therefore, we sought to generate shorter-chain peptides that are capable of binding to GLP-1R with comparable affinity to the existing agonists. We first generated a pool of peptide binders conditioned on binding affinity with the GLP-1R sequence, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling. After selecting the peptides with the highest affinity scores from the Pareto-non-dominant set, we performed docking and determined affinities of -7.4 kcal/mol and -7.0 kcal/mol for the two best candidates. We note that our peptides have strong affinity to GLP-1R and while also interacting at motifs that strongly overlap with the binding sites of semaglutide and liraglutide derived from its natural hormone ligand, GLP-1 (Figure 8). These results suggest that our PepTune-derived peptides can serve as potent agonists or antagonists of GLP-1R signaling."}, {"title": "Targeting Intracellular Proteins.", "content": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intracellular protein differentially expressed in astrocytes, a family of glial cells in the brain [64]. Dysregulation of GFAP expression has been found to cause Rosenthal fibers, astrocytic cytoplasmic inclusions that are responsible for Alexander disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting infants [65, 66]. Discovering potent binders that inhibit or degrade GFAP proteins can have significant therapeutic implications. However, no established peptide binders exist to GFAP, which motivates their de novo design. In addition to achieving high binding affinity with GFAP, we posit that an optimal peptide binder must also cross the astrocyte cell membrane into the cytosol to access GFAP. Therefore, we condition the generation of GFAP binders on five properties: binding affinity to GFAP, solubility, hemolysis, non-fouling, and cell membrane permeability using our permeability regression model, demonstrating optimization across all of these properties (Figure 9). To confirm GFAP engagement, our docking results demonstrate strong affinities of our designed peptides, motivating downstream experimental validation in astrocyte cultures (Figure 9B and D)."}, {"title": "Targeting Extracellular Proteins Without Existing Binders.", "content": "To test the ability of our model to generate binders to challenging extracellular targets without existing binders, we evaluate PepTune-generated peptides for NCAM1 and AMHR2, two therapeutically-relevant receptor proteins.

Beyond its roles in neuronal migration and synaptogenesis, NCAM1 is also crucial for memory formation, highlighting its significance in brain development [68]. As NCAM1 is an extracellular protein, we generated a library of peptides with PepTune optimized NCAM1 binding affinity, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling (Figure 10F, G). All properties exhibited an upward trend across optimization iterations.\nWe selected two binders with the highest Vina docking scores for visualization (Figure 10A-E).

Most interestingly, antagonism of AMHR2 with therapeutic peptides can potentially serve as a specific therapy for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), which affects an estimated 4% to 10% of women globally [72], as AMHR2 signaling has been implicated in follicular arrest and dysregulated ovarian function [73].\nFollowing similar computational set-ups as described previously, we generated in silico binders with high Vina predicted binding affinities (<-6 kcal/mol), despite observing a decrease in the predicted solubility along iterations (Figure 11). However, our observation of reduced solubility upon binder docking can be attributed to the presence of hydrophobic patches within the AMHR2 extracellular domain, particularly near the binding site to its ligand AMH [74]. This phenomenon highlights the importance of balancing solubility and binding affinity in binder development. With further optimization of their therapeutic properties, we hope to demonstrate the potential of these binders for applications in fertility treatment in the future.\nThe examples above demonstrate the versatility of our method, which can be effectively applied to discover peptide binders for single target proteins lacking known ligands, thereby unlocking their therapeutic potential."}, {"title": "2.6 PepTune Generates Multi-Target Specific Peptides", "content": "Multi-target drug discovery is of significant interest in various fields including cancer therapeutics and drug delivery for neurological disorders given their ability to perform multiple different functions such as binding to biological barriers like the blood-brain barrier, penetrating target cells, and inhibiting protein-protein interactions [75], [76].\nThe design of dual-target drugs remains challenging across small-molecule, peptide, and protein domains due to the often contradictory structures and properties required for high affinity and specificity to multiple protein targets [75]. Traditional techniques involve performing subsequent rounds of phage display to discover candidates that bind to both targets, which does not explore the full space of potential candidates and often results in peptides that bind to one target but fail to bind to the other. Guided diffusion presents a promising solution to de novo design of multi-target binding peptides; however, multi-target conditioning in the discrete sequence space remains under-explored.\nPepTune is uniquely positioned to tackle the multi-target optimization task since it can explore several different unmasking pathways while maintaining a set of Pareto-optimal peptide sequences with non-dominated binding affinity scores with each of the protein targets.

Notably, we observed an increase across all properties over iterations, with the final solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling scores surpassing the binders conditioned only on TfR binding affinity (Figure 12). This suggests that multi-target guidance does not result in significant trade-offs in property scores.\nTo confirm that our generated binders indeed bind to both TfR and GLAST, we selected seven binders and conducted docking against TfR and GLAST separately for each binder. Incredibly, the docking scores across all seven binders were less than or equal to -7.5 kcal/mol for both targets, with the best-scoring binder simultaneously achieving a score of -10.5 kcal/mol for TfR and a score of -9.2 kcal/mol for GLAST (Table 6). In addition, the top-performing binders have diverse secondary structures (Figure 13) and have positive solubility, and hemolysis probabilities (Table 6). The binding positions and polar interactions vary greatly across the top-performing candidates, enabling the selection of binders that fit specific location constraints. This indicates that PepTune can discover a wide subspace of optimal peptides with strong binding affinity to both TfR and GLAST that is not dependent on a specific binding motif.

For these PepTune-generated peptides, we indeed observed strong binding affinities for both GFAP and RBX1 post-docking, indicating their unique potential for multi-target interaction (Figure 14). As a note, GFAP is an intermediate filament protein [85], and thus forms a unique rod-like structure with a head domain and a tail domain. The docking positions of all three candidates were along the rod domain, binding in the gap between adjacent rods in the filament. Contrarily, docked candidates to RBX1 consistently bound close to its interaction site of Cullin, rather than at the Skp2 F-box adaptor site (Figure 14), indicating that further motif conditioning, as done with recent peptide design language models [86], would benefit PepTune's clinical potential."}, {"title": "3 Discussion", "content": "In this work, we introduce PepTune, a generative framework that achieves multi-objective optimization directly in discrete sequence space.

They have selected their activities, but still need to decide on their choice of meals for each day. As popular restaurants typically require reservations, everyone is asked to declare their preferences upfront before the trip commences.\nSuppose that 55% of them prefer Asian cuisine, 25% prefer European cuisine, 10% prefer Oceanic cuisine, and the remaining 10% prefer South American cuisine. Given that there is a maximum of three meals in any given day, it may be impossible to satisfy everyone on any single day. However, over multiple days, it may be feasible to eventually satisfy everyone. Still, adopting a day-to-day majority voting may not lead to a desirable outcome, as the Asian cuisine would be chosen for every meal, and, as a result, 45% of the group will be perpetually unhappy. A natural question is then: what would be an appropriate notion of satisfaction, and can we (efficiently) obtain an outcome that offers high satisfaction?\nAs the group moves from city to city, the set of available restaurants changes. Even within the same town, one may have different preferences for lunch and dinner, opting for a heavier meal option at lunch and a lighter one at dinner. As both preferences and the set of alternatives may evolve with time, traditional multiwinner voting models [16, 23, 30] do not fully capture this setting.\nThis problem fits within the temporal elections framework, a model where a sequence of decisions is made, and outcomes are evaluated with respect to agents' temporal preferences. It was first introduced as perpetual voting by Lackner [27]; see the survey of Elkind et al. [20] for a discussion of subsequent work. We consider the offline variant of this model where preferences are provided upfront. That is, at each timestep, each agent has a set of approved alternatives, and the goal is to select a single alternative per timestep. While this model has been considered in prior work [11, 12, 21], earlier papers focus on fairness and proportionality notions, with only a few (if at all) looking into welfare objectives and strategic considerations. Against this background, in this work we focus on the algorithmics of maximizing two classic welfare objectives: the utilitarian welfare (the sum of agents' utilities) and the egalitarian welfare (the minimum utility of any agent), both in isolation and in combination with strategyproofness and proportionality axioms.\nOur Contributions In this paper, we investigate the utilitarian (UTIL) and egalitarian (EGAL) welfare-maximization objectives from three perspectives: the computational complexity of welfare maximization, compatibility with strategyproofness, and trade-offs with proportionality.\nIn Section 3, we show that UTIL is solvable in polynomial-time, and the decision problem associated with EGAL is NP-complete even in very restricted instances. Given this, we analyze the parameterized complexity with respect to several natural parameters, and provide an ILP-based approximation.\nIn Section 4, we show that while UTIL is strategyproof, any deterministic mechanism for EGAL may fail non-obviously manipulability (NOM), a relaxation of strategyproofness. In the case where each agent has a non-empty approval set at each timestep, we show that EGAL admits no deterministic strategyproof mechanism in general, but is NOM when using leximin tie-breaking.\nFinally, in Section 5, we show that while a simple greedy algorithm can return a proportional (PROP) outcome, it is NP-hard to determine if there exists a PROP outcome that maximizes utilitarian welfare when each agent has a non-empty approval set at each timestep. We also provide upper and lower bounds for the (strong) price of proportionality with respect to both UTIL and EGAL. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate the price of proportionality in temporal elections."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "For each positive integer k, let [k] := {1, ..., k}. Let N = [n] be a set of n agents, let P = {P1,...,pm} be a set of m projects (or candidates), and let T = [l] be a set of l timesteps. For each k\u2208 [l], the set of projects approved by agent i \u2208 N at timestep k is captured by her approval set Sik P. The approval sets of agent i are collected in her approval vector Si = (Si1, ..., Sie). Thus, an instance of our problem is a tuple (N, P, l, (Si)i\u2208N).\nAn outcome is a vector o = (01,..., 0\u2113), where ok \u2208 P for each k\u2208 [l]. The utility of an agent i \u2208 N for an outcome o is given by ui(0) = |{k \u2208 [l]: Ok \u2208 Sik}|. Let II(I) denote the space of all possible outcomes for an instance I. A mechanism maps an instance I = (N, P, l, (Si)ien) to an outcome in II(Z).\nWe do not require each agent to approve at least one project at each timestep; however, we do require that each agent approves at least one project at some timestep, i.e., for each i \u2208 N there exists ak\u2208 [l] with Sik \u2260 0; indeed, if this condition is failed for some"}, {"title": "3 Welfare Maximization", "content": "We first focus on welfare maximization, without combining it with other desiderata. The two objectives we consider are defined as follows.\nDefinition 1 (Social Welfare). Given an outcome o, its utilitarian social welfare is defined as $\\sum_{i \\in N} u_i(o)$ and its egalitarian social welfare is defined as $\\min_{i \\in N} u_i(o)$. We refer to outcomes that maximize the utilitarian/egalitarian welfare as UTIL/EGAL outcomes, respectively.\nA UTIL outcome can be found in polynomial time: at each timestep, one can simply select the project that has the highest number of approvals. However, observe that if 51% of the population approves project p at each timestep, while 49% of the population approves project q at each timestep (and there are no other approvals), if we select the UTIL outcome, close to half of the population will not get a single project approved at any timestep. This underscores the need to consider other criteria for selecting outcomes, such as, e.g., egalitarian welfare. However, while computing a UTIL outcome is computationally feasible, this is not the case for EGAL outcomes. The decision problem associated with computing EGAL outcomes, which we denote by EGAL-DEC, is defined as follows."}, {"title": "4 Strategyproofness and Non-Obvious Manipulability", "content": "An important consideration in the context of collective decision-making is strategyproofness: no agent should be able to increase their utility by misreporting their preferences. It is formally defined as follows. Note that agent i's utility function u\u2081 is computed with respect to his (truthful) approval vector Si.\nDefinition 2 (Strategyproofness). For each i\u2208 N, let S-i denote the list of all approval vectors except that of agent i: S_i = (S1,..., Si-1, Si+1,..., Sn).

We will refer to this algorithm as GREEDYUTIL."}, {"title": "5 Proportionality", "content": "Another property that may be desirable in the context of temporal voting (and has been considered by others in similar settings [13, 18]) is proportionality (PROP).\nDefinition 4 (Proportionality). Given an instance I = (N, P, l, (Si)i\u2208N), for each i \u2208 N let $\\mu_i = |\\{k \\in [l] : S_{ik} \\neq \\emptyset\\}|$. We say that an outcome o is proportional (PROP) for I if for all i \u2208 N it holds that $u_i(o) \\geq \\lceil\\frac{\\mu_i}{n}\\rceil$.\nWe note that proportionality is often understood as guaranteeing each agent at least 1/n-th of her maximum utility, which would correspond to using $\\frac{\\mu_i}{n}$ instead of $\\lceil\\frac{\\mu_i}{n}\\rceil$ in the right-hand side of our definition [13, 18, 26]. However, the requirement that $u_i(o) \\geq \\mu_i$ may be impossible to satisfy: e.g. if N = {1,2}, l = 3, P = {P1, P2} and for i = 1, 2 agent i approves project pi at each timestep, we cannot simultaneously guarantee utility 3/2 to both agents. Moreover, the proof of Theorem 3.4 shows that the associated decision problem is NP-complete. In contrast, our definition can be satisfied by a simple greedy algorithm. This follows from a similar result obtained by Conitzer et al. [13] in the setting of public decision-making; we provide a proof in the full version of this paper for completeness."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "We investigated the problem of maximizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare for temporal elections. We showed that, while UTIL outcomes can be computed in polynomial time and can be achieved in a strategyproof manner, EGAL is NP-complete and obviously manipulable. To circumvent the NP-hardness of EGAL, we analyzed its parameterized complexity with respect to n, m and l, and provided an approximation algorithm that is based on randomized rounding. We also established the existence of a NOM mechanism for EGAL under a mild constraint on agents' preferences. Finally, we considered proportionality and showed that it is computationally hard to select the 'best' proportional outcome. We also gave upper and lower bounds for the (strong) price of proportionality with respect to both UTIL and EGAL.\nWe discuss several possible directions for future work.\nMaximizing the p-mean welfare objective One possible extension to our work is analyzing the more general p-mean welfare objective. The associated decision problem is defined as follows.\n\nNote that setting p = 1 (respectively, p = -\u221e) would correspond to the utilitarian (respectively, egalitarian) welfare. Setting p \u2192 0 corresponds to maximizing the geometric mean, or Nash welfare (we denote the corresponding decision problem of maximizing the Nash welfare by NASH). We also note that many of the computational hardness and impossibility results for EGAL directly translate to similar results for NASH: NASH is obviously manipulable in the general setting and not strategyproof even in the CP setting. NASH is also NP-complete even when m = 2 and is W[2]-hard with respect to l. The XP algorithm with respect to l also works for NASH. While our FPT algorithm (with respect to n) for EGAL relies on an ILP that does not extend to NASH, a randomized XP algorithm has been proposed for a more demanding setting [18]. Now, for our setting, we can show that there is a deterministic XP algorithm (with respect to n) for any p-mean welfare objective, which includes NASH."}]}

It also addresses the philosophical tradition of hermeneutics (Don Ihde,\nWilhelm Dilthey) to highlight a parallel with this movement and to demystify the idea of\nhuman-like Al.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The notion of interpretation is increasingly\npresent in the world of artificial intelligence\n(Al). For humans, it involves interpreting\nalgorithms that are difficult to explain\nmathematically. For machines, the\nchallenge is to interpret data to draw\nconclusions. They must now also interpret\nbrief instructions in natural language: this is\nthe operational principle of ChatGPT and\nother chatbots grounded on generative Al\nwhich interacts verbally with unsettling\nfluidity. We can thus speak of a true\ninterpretive turning point in Al.\n\nThe art of interpretation, however, has\nbeen known for centuries under the term\n\"hermeneutics\". It initially applied to the\nreading of poets or sacred texts before\nevolving into a philosophical current to\nsignify that interpretation is at the\nfoundation of understanding, or even that\nit represents the necessary activity of who\nwe are (Gadamer, 2004-1960; Heidegger,\n1962-1927; Nietzsche, 1954-1886/1887,\n2003-1887). Our access to the world is\nindeed always influenced by certain tones\nthat are not neutral but carry a cultural\ncharge. Does the resemblance stop\nhowever at the mere use of the term\ninterpretation? In other words, is Al doing\nhermeneutics? Should we use the art of\ninterpretation to understand machines? Or\nis it both?"}, {"title": "1. Direct Dialogue with the Machine\nin Our Language", "content": "The event that completes the interpretive\nturn of Al is undoubtedly the launch of\nChatGPT in November 2022. The essential\ninnovation of large language models, like its\nown, is that the machine is required to\ninterpret human instructions more than\never before. The user inputs a prompt to\nrequest what they want, and then the\nsystem provides a response, whether it's\ntext, an image, or spoken output.\n\nWe no longer address the machine in\ncomputer language, in code, but in natural\nlanguage or what is called unstructured\ndata. Certainly, the \u201challucinations\" (errors\nof the machine in the form of plausible but\ndelusional statements) are countless, and\nthe results can still be improved, but\nsomething is happening. Interpretation, an\nactivity we long believed was reserved for\nhumans, is now being undertaken by digital\ntools.\n\nComputing has already long been an object\nof interpretation, since science has\nincreasingly relied on digital instruments\nand imaging techniques (medical,\nnanometric, spectroscopic, etc.). The\nAmerican philosopher Don Ihde, who\npassed away this year, noticed this early on,\nfirst in his work \"Technology and the\nLifeworld\" (Ihde, 1990).\n\nUnfortunately, it is only after his death that\nhis relevance seems to leap out at us. \"All\nimagery calls for interpretation\", he wrote\n(Ihde, 2021, Chapter 1). He goes on to\nexplain that imagery is \"materially\ntechnological in its instrumental\nembodiment\" because it requires the use\nof a sophisticated tool to produce it, reveal\nthe image, and thus the object being\nstudied.\n\n[His] idea for a material hermeneutics is\nclosely tied to the 20th-21st shift to micro-\nprocessing imaging technologies that\ntransform science practice and evidence\nproduction [...] These technologies helped\nenhance the necessity for interpretation or\nhermeneutics practices in natural science.\n(Ihde, 2021, Chapter 4)\n\nFor Ihde, what characterizes this \"necessity\nfor interpretation\" is that we are no longer\nbeing in a direct relationship with things.\nWe must go through instruments or images\nin such a way that we construct the object"}, {"title": "2. The Return of Ambiguity", "content": "According to Ihde, the interpretive turn\nthat science has taken tends to bridge the\ngap between \"explanation\" and\n\"understanding\u201d (Dilthey, 1989-1883). It is\none thing to explain how a castle was built,\nwith what materials or techniques. It is\nanother to understand the reason for its\nexistence, why its builders decided to erect\nit in a particular place at a certain time. In\nthis latter case (that of understanding), it is\nnecessary to call upon interpretation, in\nlight of historical elements. However,\nscience increasingly veers\ninto\ninterpretation in order not to merely\nexplain the objects it studies. This marks a\nrapprochement between the sciences and\nthe humanities (literature, philosophy,\nhistory...).\n\nAl further accentuates this rapprochement.\nAlready because the machine is asked to\ninterpret what is given to it, but also\nbecause humans must increasingly\ninterpret the results produced by the\nmachine (Lundberg & Lee, 2017; Ribeiro et\nal., 2016). Ambiguity is taking on a growing\nrole in the world of computing, which, as an\nheir to mathematics, believed it was\npreserved from such things. And where\nthere is ambiguity, there is also\ninterpretation. Current Al systems,"}, {"title": "3. Interpreting to Find Meaning", "content": "If Al is indeed capable of interpreting our\nstatements to some extent in order to\ngenerate an answer, understanding seems\nto be nevertheless a phenomenon that\ngoes beyond this. To understand something\nrequires a certain amount of imagination to\nconceive the object of our knowledge in its\nmultiple and new configurations, to grasp it\nin a way that is rarely formal but comes\nthrough feeling. Some pupils recite their\nlessons admirably without understanding\nanything, as they lack the necessary feeling\nto exclaim: \"Got it!\" or, as Archimedes is\nbelieved to have said, \"Eureka!\" This feeling\nis almost impossible to describe, but have\nyou never marveled at suddenly\nunderstanding something that had resisted\nyou? If so, you know well what this feeling\nis, this sensory event of understanding.\n\nAnd this feeling is fertile, as it can produce\ninterpretation: new connections appear,\nnew configurations, new horizons that feed\nour imagination. We sometimes say: \"that\nmakes sense\" and it really does. It makes\nsense, literally, as I feel an interpretation to\nbe right. This is then an aspect of\ninterpretation that\nseparates our\nunderstanding from what machines do,\nsince computer systems are unable to feel.\nThe imagination necessary for the art of\ninterpretation will always be for them an\nimpoverished version of it, an \"e-\nmagination\" (Romele, 2020).\n\nThe interpretation produced by generative\nAl thus differs from ours in that it is\nincapable of understanding anything.\nNevertheless, it represents a decisive\naspect of the interpretive turn that unfolds\nin various ways in the world of sciences."}]}

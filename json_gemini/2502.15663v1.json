In particular, environmental control systems, such as HVAC, play a critical role, as they are responsible for approximately 50-60% of energy consumption and 40-60% of CO2 emissions [1,2] There is a possibility of implementing distributed control in scenarios featuring numerous devices distributed across multiple structures, by aggregating sensor data from various units and promoting sophisticated and distributed decision-making processes. Recent studies have explored the application of AI-based distributed control solutions, which leverage multi-agent architectures to coordinate and optimize the operation of these systems [3]. Such architectures not only enable enhanced system responsiveness and efficiency, but also open new avenues for research in addressing scalability, robustness, and interoperability challenges in complex distributed environments.\nWe are researching and developing on the application of modern multi-agent architectures to design a distributed control system for scenarios with multiple devices and multiple sites in an same region. We focus on data centers that operate fleets of air-cooled chillers in data center scenarios, typically managing between 30 to 100 devices per building and spanning multiple buildings per site. Each facility presents unique configurations and operational conditions, compounded by extremely strict security and proprietary requirements that require localized, resilient solutions. We are exploring methods for implementing distributed autonomous agents to facilitate real-time monitoring and adaptation, fault tolerance, scalability, and security compliance.\nOur research contributes to the state-of-the-art by providing:\n\u2013 A novel distributed control framework that leverages multi-agent architectures for efficient energy management in data centers.\n\u2013 An in-depth analysis of real-time monitoring, adaptation, and fault-tolerant mechanisms in complex, multi-site environments.\n\u2013 Insights into the integration of security and proprietary constraints into decentralized control systems.\n\u2013 Empirical results that validate the scalability and robustness of our approach under various operational conditions."}, {"title": "2 Proposal", "content": "Recent research highlights the benefits of multi-agent collaboration for energy-efficient building systems [4, 5]. Solutions built on these architectures can be implemented on premises, aligning with stringent data center security policies while enhancing the overall resilience of the cooling system [6]. Multi-agent systems (MAS) minimizes reliance on centralized infrastructure while improving adaptability and efficiency by distributing intelligence across localized agents. Key operational advantages include [7]:\nSituatedness: agents are situated in an environment which they can influence and be influenced by.\nOpenness: agents are able to accommodate changes in the system structure as when, for example, new components enter the system or existing components leave.\nLocality in control: agents can operate autonomously based on local policies. In mobile services, this may be necessary to ensure robustness of the service.\nLocality in interactions: agents are able to interact with other components in local geographical or logical neighborhoods.\nEnhanced Security: Reducing data transmission to external servers mitigates cybersecurity risks.\nScalability: Distributed decision-making allows the system to expand dynamically without single points of failure.\nAdaptive Coordination: Each chiller auto-adapts its setpoints while synchronizing with neighboring units to optimize overall performance."}, {"title": "3 Use Cases", "content": "Our experiments demonstrate that intelligent redistribution optimizes cooling efficiency without overloading a single unit, leading to an estimated 5-15% improvement in energy efficiency while maintaining thermal comfort. This use case occurs during periods of high electricity demand, such as hot summer afternoons, when energy costs can surge because of increased cooling requirements. A Coordinator Agent within the multi-agent system (MAS) dynamically optimizes chiller operations to mitigate excessive power consumption. Instead of uniformly increasing cooling loads across all units, the system strategically adjusts operations:\nChillers near the building perimeter, where cooler external air intake is available, are directed to operate at higher efficiency.\nChillers in hotter zones reduce their load to balance the overall system.\nIn addition, preliminary experiments demonstrate that proactive workload distribution extends the lifespan of the equipment by up to 30%, reducing unplanned downtime and maintenance costs. Over time, chillers wear and tear, requiring periodic maintenance to maintain optimal performance. MAS enhances adaptive scheduling by continuously monitoring runtime thresholds and dynamically redistributing workloads when necessary. Instead of running all chillers at equal load, the system strategically shifts tasks:\nWhen specific chillers approach their recommended runtime limits, MAS shifts cooling tasks to recently maintained units.\nThis prevents overloading older equipment, reducing mechanical strain and lowering the likelihood of sudden failures.\nWe also demonstrate that keeping all decision-making and learning processes on-premises eliminates cybersecurity risks associated with data transmission, ensuring full compliance with security policies. Data privacy is a critical concern for data centers, especially when optimizing cooling efficiency using AI-based models. MAS enables secure local learning, allowing each site to develop optimization strategies without exposing sensitive operational data to external servers. Instead of relying on cloud-based learning, the system ensures:\nEach facility trains its own RL-based optimization models using localized sensor data.\nAll decision-making remains on-premises, eliminating risks associated with external data transmission.\nFinally, our research explores dynamic chiller adjustments based on real-time weather variations to reduce unnecessary energy consumption and improve system stability. The environmental conditions can change unexpectedly, affecting the efficiency of the cooling system. MAS improves resilience by incorporating a Weather Agent that detects sudden temperature fluctuations and adjusts operations accordingly. Instead of relying on static cooling schedules, the system proactively modifies operations:\nIf an unanticipated nighttime temperature drop is detected, the coordinator agent adjusts the chiller speeds to prevent unnecessary cooling.\nDuring heatwaves, MAS redistributes cooling loads between zones to prevent overheating and improve energy efficiency."}, {"title": "4 Challenges and Opportunities", "content": "The integration of a Multi-Agent System (MAS)-based distributed control architecture for energy-efficient building systems presents several challenges, including:\nInter-Agent Coordination Complexity: Ensuring seamless collaboration between autonomous agents can be challenging, especially in large-scale implementations where communication delays and decision conflicts can arise.\nComputational and Hardware Constraints: Deploying local deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents on edge devices requires computational efficiency, as resource limitations can impact real-time processing and decision-making.\nSecurity and Privacy Concerns: Although local decision-making reduces external data transmission, vulnerabilities within the local network may still expose critical control systems to cyber threats.\nScalability and Interoperability: Ensuring that the MAS framework can scale effectively while remaining compatible with heterogeneous IoT devices, sensors, and existing building management systems is a key challenge.\nTraining Data and Adaptability: real-world environmental changes may introduce non-stationary, requiring adaptive mechanisms to prevent performance degradation.\nWe seek to address these challenges through a combination of advanced control strategies, system design optimizations, and adaptive learning mechanisms.\nEnhanced Inter-Agent Coordination: we are exploring hierarchical multi-agent coordination to mitigate communication delays and decision conflicts.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "MAGNETIC Resonance Imaging (MRI) is often the\nfavored medical imaging technique for clinical exam-ination due to its high resolution, soft tissue contrast and\nlack of harmful exposure to radiation. One drawback of MRI\nacquisitions is the long imaging time, which can not only lead\nto artifacts in the image itself due to patient movement, but\nalso be exhausting for the patient. To speed up the imaging\nprocess, nowadays, scanner acquire the image information\nwith multiple coils and often use a technique called undersam-pling [1][2]. The concept of undersampling involves acquiring\nonly a reduced amount of information and subsequently re-constructing it, resulting in imaging acceleration of up to 48\ntimes [3], although in clinical practice, it is often limited to\nup to 10 times.\nEven though the scanning time for the patient is greatly\nimproved, the undersampled data leads to wrapping artifacts\nas well as lower signal values, decreasing the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) by by the square root of the undersampling rate.\nAs a consequence, complex reconstruction methods, such as\nfor example the commonly used algorithms GRAPPA [4] or\nSENSE [5] have to be applied on the raw data, which can be\nvery time intensive and introduce additonal noise amplification\n(also known as geometry factor, g-factor) [6].\nWith a fatality rate of 11% and being the most frequent\nmalignancy among men in 2023 [7], the detection for prostate\ncancer (PCa) is an urgent task. Because downstream tasks,\nsuch as segmentation and classification rely on fully recon-structed image data, there is a great urge to reduce the\nreconstruction time. Due to advances in the field of deep\nlearning in the past years, the quality of reconstruction of the\nundersampled data has greatly improved, while reducing the\ncomputation times [8][9]. While all common reconstruction\nalgorithms output an image interpretable for radiologist and\nother clinicians, raw MRI data is acquired in the so called\nk-Space. This complex valued raw data, which is normally\ndiscarded after reconstruction, holds more information than\ncurrently used by downstream tasks [10], such as tumor\nclassification.\nIn this work, we show that by utilizing the MRI k-Space,\nclassification on MRI data can be improved. Additionally,\ndue to the elimination of time-intensive reconstruction tech-"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "For prostate cancer detection and classification, multiple\ndifferent clinical methods can be used, such as [11]:\n\u2022 prostate-specific antigen (PSA),\n\u2022 digital rectal exam,\n\u2022 trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS),\n\u2022 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).\nBecause the first three methods often lead to more discomfort\nfor the patient, today MRI, especially multiparametric MRI,\nincluding diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), is the preferred\nmethod for detecting PCa [12][13]. The scans are commonly\nranked by the clinical Pi-RADS score in a range between\none (clinically significant cancer is highly unlikely) to five\n(clinically significant cancer is highly likely) [14].\nOne major issue of MRI is the aspect of time needed\nfor performing the scan itself, with DWI scans taking up\nto 10 minutes. By reducing the imaging time, which also\nincreases the comfort for the patient, more subjects can be\nscanned in the clinical routine. One common way of reducing\nthe scanning time is to undersample the so called k-Space,\ne.g. only scanning every forth k-Space line, thus reducing\nthe overall scanning time by the factor of \u00d74. Another time\nconsuming aspect of MRI is the k-Space reconstruction after\nthe initial scan, such as GRAPPA, which can take more than\n10 additional minutes.\nWith the advent of machine learning, especially in the\nmedical domain [15][16], radiologist have new, powerful tools\nat their hand to support them in their search for clinically\nsignificant PCa. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such\nas the ConvNeXt [17], show superhuman performance on a\nwide range of classification tasks and are adaptable to many\ndifferent fields of work. Novel algorithms can detect PCa\nbased on the DWI images automatically [18]. Schelb et al.\n[19] showed that their U-Net trained with T2-weighted and\ndiffusion MRI was able to achieve similar performance to Pi-\nRADS assessment.\nBut all state-of-the art algorithms for prostate cancer de-tection have two things in common: they only work on fully\nsampled or reconstructed data and they perform the detection\nin the image domain, after an inverse Fourier transformation\nhas been performed and the raw data has been filled.\nBy performing all these preprocessing steps, including k-Space reconstruction, inverse Fourier Transformation and dis-card of the phase information, valuable information in the raw\ndata is lost irreversibly.\nThe k-Strip algorithm [20] showed, that segmentation tasks,\nsuch as skull stripping, are possible directly in the MRI raw\ndata domain. The authors implemented a complex valued\nconvolutional neural network, which takes the k-Space as\na direct input. In this work we build on the idea to use\nMRI raw data. We present superior results in detecting likely\nPCa on DWI raw data, optionally without the need of time\nexpensive reconstruction techniques, such as GRAPPA, al-lowing a greatly reduced scanning time, while still achieving\nmeaningful predictions."}, {"title": "III. MATERIAL AND METHODS", "content": "The Fourier Transformation [21] is one of the most im-portant equations in signal theory. It converts a 2D-signal\nfrom the time-domain into the frequency-domain or from the\nspatial-domain into the spatial-frequency-domain. By using the\ninverse form, one can convert the raw MRI data (k-Space) into\nthe image domain. This process is completely reversible and\ndoes not lose any information, as long as both magnitude and\nphase are preserved.\nThe so-called k-Space is the complex valued raw data\ndomain of MRIs. By applying the inverse Fourier Transforma-tion, one can convert the data into the complex valued image\ndomain. Today, MRI scanner use multiple coils to acquire\ndifferent parts of the image simultaneously, which are then\ncombined by performing a root square sum (RSS) calculation\nover all coils in the image domain. By using the sensitivity of\neach coil, the final image can be modulated out of the resulting\nset of k-Space matrices.\nCommonly used images for downstream tasks, such as\ntumor classification, are only the magnitudinal data of the\nimage domain, leading to a loss of phase information. Phase\ninformation was shown to be useful for many downstream\ntasks, an example being flow detection [22].\nThe amount of publicly available datasets which include\nMRI raw data is scarce, as this data is not commonly saved in\nclinical practice. We are only aware of a single dataset, suitable\nfor classification tasks. Nevertheless we are able to show the\nadvantage of using the raw data over only using magnitudinal\ndata.\nThe FastMRI Prostate dataset [23] contains T2 and DWI\nraw data with different amounts of coils (14 - 30) and slices\n(24 - 38), with a in-plane resolution of 2.0 \u00d7 2.0 mm.

EXPERIMENTS", "content": "In a first experiment, we compare the prediction results on\nthe \"gold-standard\u201d data with and without additionally k-Space\ninformation.

The two methods are compared on the fully\nreconstructed data, as well as at the native undersampling rate\nof x2. For this experiments, both models are trained with\nundersampling rates of up to x2.\nIn the second experiment, we compare the GRAPPA recon-struction method with the PCA pipeline to show the theoretical\ntime benefits at higher undersampling rates of up to x64. The\nundersampling is digital by removing lines in the k-Space and\nthus does not fully simulate real undersampling at these high\nrates. The b50 data is summed over the x, y and z values to\ncreate one channel for each coil and then compressed via a\nPCA.

DISCUSSION", "content": "In this paper, we proposed a novel MRI raw data preprocess-ing pipeline in combination with a state-of-the art classification\nneural network to utilize the hidden information in the k-Space\nfor better prediction results as well as faster acquisition and\nreconstruction times, while still achieving meaningful results\nfor prostate cancer likelihood predictions. Using additional k-Space information with a dual network structure we were able\nto improve the predictions for different data combinations,\nincluding the \"gold-standard\", consisting of ADC, Trace50\nand Trace1000 maps. By applying a PCA instead of time\nintensive reconstruction techniques such as GRAPPA, as well\nas using high undersampling factors, the scanning time, as\nwell as the time needed for a first initial diagnosis can be\ngreatly reduced by more than 80%. When performing PCa\nprediction at undersampling factors greater than eight, the\nadditional information in phase and k-Space show improved\nstability of the network, enabling it to reach sound results,\nwhile the model with only magnitudinal data (which is the\ndata radiologists use for their review) starts to fail making\nmeaningful predictions.\nNevertheless, this study comes with limitations, one being\nthe simple form of undersampling used. The undersampling by\nevenly leaving out k-Space lines can simulate the correspond-ing artefacts. It can not reproduce the lower signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) due to fewer acquired measurements [29] or the\nreduced motion artifacts due to shorter acquisition times. For\nDWI imaging with EPI, higher undersampling rates may result\nin a different image contrast due to reduced T2* weighting as\nwell as distortions due to the shorter echo train.\nPerformance on more complex undersampling techniques\nfor other imaging sequences will be explored in future ex-periments. Additionally, the digital undersampling on the\nGRAPPA output does not reflect the actual data we would use\nwhen GRAPPA is applied. Undersampling would be applied\nbefore performing reconstruction. Reconstruction techniques\nsuch as GRAPPA then try to reconstruct the full k-Space\nby interpolation. This could lead to better results at low\nundersampling. At higher undersampling, we suspect a faster\nperformance drop-off as seen in the experiments because of\nintroduced noise amplification in the images due to the ill-posed reconstruction problem at high undersampling rates.\nThis is suspect of further investigations. Because of the time\nintensive nature of GRAPPA we decided in this work to\nperform the reconstruction once on the original dataset and\nperforming artificial undersampling afterwards.\nThe PCA coil compression approach used in this work only\nuses the first principal component for coil compression. This\napproach showed good results, even surpassing ESPIRIT coil\ncombination [30], in the case of DWI prostate data and using\nadditional PCA components did not lead to better results. This\nfinding can not be generalized and needs to be evaluated for\nother sequences.\nAnother limitation is the prediction only based on the Pi-RADS score, which tends to be less exact than other ratings\nfor PCa review, such as histopathological examination. In\ncombination with the highly imbalanced dataset, this can lead\nto unstable training.\nFuture work sees the implementation of a fully complex\nneural network, which can utilize the complex nature of the\nk-Space properly. This would also include special layers used\nfor k-Space data, such as the Spectral Pooling [31] or Fourier\nConvolution [32]. Future work also sees the use of mpMRI\nraw data for detecting PCa. Additionally we hypothesize, that\nthe results at small undersampling factors are similar for all\napproaches due to the fact, that the used neural network is\npretrained on data in the magnitudinal image domain. Thus the\npretraining on k-Space data will be part of coming projects.\nThis work is not only supposed to be a study specifically\nperformed on PCa data, but we want to emphasize the broader\npicture our results are supposed to show: Clinicians and\nresearchers should start to take into account all the available\ninformation acquired in an MRI scan, instead of discarding\nhalf of the data right after the preprocessing steps. That way\nwe want to pave the way for better diagnostics in the future\nby exploiting the raw data domain of MRI scans and at one\npoint eliminating the need for most of the time and resource\nintensive preprocessing steps, which only goal it is to make\nthe data more interpretable for humans."}, {"title": "VII.

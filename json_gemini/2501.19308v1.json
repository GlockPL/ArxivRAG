{"title": "Ontological analysis of proactive life event services", "authors": ["Kuldar Taveter"], "abstract": "Life event service is a direct digital public service provided jointly by several governmental institutions so that a person can fulfill all the obligations and use all the rights that arise due to a particular event or situation in personal life. Life event service consolidates several public services related to the same life event into one service for the service consumer. This paper presents an ontological analysis of life event services, which is based on the works by Guarino, Guizzardi, Nardi, Wagner, and others. The purpose of the ontological analysis is to understand the meanings of life event, proactive public service based on life event, and other related notions. This kind of ontological analysis is crucial because for implementing the hardware and software architectures of e-government and digital public services, it is essential to agree upon the precise meanings of the underlying terms.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The Government of Estonia has stated in the regulation \"Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information\" [1] a new direction towards \u201cinvisible\" public services which are combined around a person's life event in a manner that they seem as one comprehensive and smooth service. The life event services should require no more than one interaction between a person and an institution, moreover, ideally are delivered fully automatically without any interactions. The Estonian digital society development plan for the year 2030 [2] describes the next development leap of the digital country with public services that are event-based, proactive, human-centered and powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The development of digital services must be based on technological and social trends and the changed expectations and needs of society. The next stage of development of the digital government will link these challenges and opportunities into a complete personal government. A personal government [3] means redesigning public services so that the complexity of the public sector remains in the background for their consumers. They get their actions carried out as simply as possible and when necessary. With the same meaning, the term \"algorithmic government\" has been used in the research literature [13]."}, {"title": "2 Background of proactive life event services", "content": "Ontological analysis [6] divides entities into universals and particulars. Universals are abstract concepts that do not exist in time and space that is, they cannot be localized. Examples of universals are mathematical objects such as numbers and sets, modeling constructs such as goals and roles, and types such as types of agents, objects, and activities. Universals are patterns or properties that materialize in many different particulars.\nParticulars, on the other hand, are entities that exist at least in time. An example of an entity that exists in time but not necessarily in space is a computer program. Each particle has a specific identity. Particulars can be distinguished from universals by the \"causality criterion\", according to which a particular can cause another particular, while there is no such causal connection between universals. In the context of life events and event services, we are more interested in particulars, which is why we discuss them in more detail below. The division of entities into universals and particulars is expressed in Fig. 1, which depicts the ontological metamodel of life event services."}, {"title": "3 Analysis of proactive life event services", "content": "Life event depicted in Fig. 1 is an event that separates two different states of at least one physical or institutional agent. As we explained in Section 2, such states are termed as states of affairs. Examples of life events are marriage, pregnancy, birth of a child, creation of a company, naming a child, expansion of the company's share capital, obtaining management rights, property acquisition and retirement.\nA life event can be reflected by data events in various state registers, information systems and databases, and based on this, various activities related to the provision of public services can be triggered.\nA process is a complex event consisting of two or more sequential or parallel events. Examples of a process are a storm, a football game, a conversation, a birthday party, and shopping in an online store. Activity is a process performed by one or more agents. For example, running is an action because John runs, but boiling is a chemical process that does not involve any agent performing it. Activity consists of atomic actions. An activity in which two or more agents participate includes interactions between these agents.\nPublic service is a set of all activities that realize the obligation of a public institutional agent to make available to individuals - physical agents or other institutional agents organizations - capabilities that meet their needs, also giving them opportunities to control how and when such capabilities can be used [8]. According to [14], ability is ontologically defined as the property of a physical or institutional agent to perform certain actions or create certain outputs under certain conditions. In the case of public services, such specific conditions are, for example, the Citizen's right to consume the corresponding service and the availability of the resources necessary to consume the service.\nA public service consists of one activity of offering a given service and many activities of processing a request to use a given service one for each request to use the service [8]. In addition, the request to use the service triggers activities related to the management of the given service, such as activities that process the request to use the service and decide whether to enable the given service to the requester, as well as service provision activities and service provision control and monitoring activities [8]. For each public service, one and only one uniquely identifiable service offering activity is required, whereas there may be zero or more activities processing service usage requests. Therefore, the service provision activity indicator also includes the service as a whole, which may include several activities of providing a given service but does not identify with any of them [8].\nAccording to the Regulation of the Government of Estonia \"Basics of Service Organization and Information Management\" [1], a proactive service is a direct public service that the institution provides on its own initiative, on the basis of the assumed will of individuals and on the basis of the data in the databases belonging to the state information system. Proactive service is provided automatically or with the person's consent. According to the same regulation [1], event service is a direct public service that several institutions provide jointly so that a person can fulfill all obligations and use all rights that arise due to one event or situation. The event service aggregates several services related to the same life event into one service for the user.\nIn order to include proactive and life event services, it is necessary to change the definition of public service provided in [8]. Namely, in the case of a proactive event service, there may be a lack of a direct desire to use the service, which is why we replaced the concept of service request processing introduced in [8] and represented in Fig. 2 with the concept of service initialization processing shown in Fig. 1. According to Fig. 1, a life event triggers zero or more service initialization processing activities, each of which includes activities related to the management and delivery of the corresponding service(s). The service management activity includes the service admission activity, which typically has to comply with specific rules. In case of life event services, such rules can be seen as business rules of the type reaction rules [9,11] that define the conditions under which the public service is triggered by the given life event. Such conditions may include checking if the person has opted out from the proactive electronic service format [10], in which case the service is not provided before an explicit request.\nThe notion of life event is also included by the Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) by the European Commission [5], which is a simplified, reusable and extendable data model that describes the main attributes of services offered by public administrations. The purpose of the CPSV-AP is twofold: to standardise catalogues of public services offered in the EU countries and to simplify and standardise data exchange for applying digital public services within EU. The Life Event class of the CPSV-AP represents an important event or situation in a citizen's life where public services are required. In the context of the CPSV-AP, the Life Event class only represents an event to which a public service is related. For example, a couple becoming engaged is not a CPSV-AP Life Event, while getting married is, since only the latter has any relevance to public services [5]. In this sense, the Life Event class of the CPSV-AP is narrower than the Life Event concept included by the ontological metamodel depicted in Figure 1, which is more similar to the notion of data event that was introduced above in this section."}, {"title": "4 Conclusions", "content": "Estonia is the first member state of the European Union that has legislatively defined proactive life event services. Surely, other European Union member states and the European Commission will soon follow Estonia in this regard. To avoid terminological confusion, provision of proactive life event services should be based on an ontological metamodel. This is essential for proper implementation of hardware and software architectures of e-government, but also for standardization and interoperability within EU.\nIn this paper, we propose the metamodel for proactive life event services, which is based on [14] and extends [8]. In the future, we plan to delve more deeply into the topic of admission rules of public services that ultimately define the level and type of proactivity, which have been categorized in [12,15]."}]}

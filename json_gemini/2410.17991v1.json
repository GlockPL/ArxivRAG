Food items are placed on nodes, forming a strongly connected graph with links associated with pheromone (\u03c4) and heuristic information (n) values. The heuristic value (n) is initialized as the inverse of the squared sum of differences between all ingredients in food items.n is used to balance exploration and exploitation in the ACO algorithm, with its value ranging between 0 and 1.\n\nUtkarsh Upadhyay,Aishwarya Srivastava [3] Emphasized the growing importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle through a balanced diet, exercise, and avoiding poor food choices.Diet recommendation systems have emerged as tools offering personalized dietary guidance by leveraging technology, data science, and AI.

METHODOLOGY", "content": "The ML-powered Health Adviser is a web application that utilizes machine learning to deliver personalized health recommendations based on the symptoms entered by users. Through an easy-to-use web interface, users can input their symptoms, which are then processed by the application, developed with the Flask web framework. The system uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the most likely disease and subsequently retrieves relevant information from a database. This information includes recommended treatments, medications, and dietary suggestions. The recommendations are then presented to the user in a clear and understandable format, helping them make informed decisions regarding their health.\n\nAbout Flask:\nFlask is a lightweight, flexible Python web framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It is user-friendly and efficient, offering essential functionalities like routing, templating, and request handling. Flask is ideal for both novice and experienced developers seeking to build scalable web applications without the complexity of larger frameworks.\n\nRecommender System\nA recommender system helps users discover relevant items, such as health suggestions, by analyzing user inputs or preferences. By using algorithms and data analysis, these systems predict the most appropriate recommendations for the user. They are widely utilized across various domains, from e-commerce to healthcare, to provide personalized suggestions based on user behavior and data.\n\nCOLLABORATIVE FILTERING:\nIn the context of medicine recommendation, collaborative filtering suggests treatments based on the symptoms by utilizing data from similar patients who have successfully undergone treatments for those symptoms.\n\nCONTENT-BASED FILTERING:\nThis approach recommends medications by matching the patient's symptoms to drug profiles, relying on feature similarity between the symptoms and medications.\n\nSUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM):\nSVM is used to classify symptoms and predict the most effective medication by determining the optimal boundary between different treatment options.\n\nK-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN):\nKNN suggests treatments by analyzing the medications given to patients with similar symptoms in the past.\n\nDeep Learning:\nDeep learning, through neural networks, models complex relationships in patient data, providing personalized medication recommendations based on symptom-treatment patterns learned over time.\n\nThe system starts by allowing users to input symptoms they are experiencing or select them from a predefined list. The input is then sent to the backend, where the disease is detected, and appropriate medicines, precautions, and steps are recommended. The system processes the input using a machine learning model that has been trained with a comprehensive set of data. Once processed, the output is sent back to the user interface.\n\nThe ML-driven health adviser is essentially a recommendation system that follows several stages to produce tailored results. Since it must recommend various aspects such as disease names, medications, exercises, and precautions based on the symptoms provided, the dataset used must be accurate and well-prepared.\n\nTo achieve the best results, the system should utilize an algorithm that provides the highest accuracy and best fits the dataset. After selecting the optimal algorithm, it is used to train and test the model, ensuring the creation of an accurate recommender system. For a seamless user experience, Flask is utilized to connect the selected algorithm to the web server."}, {"title": "IV.RESULT AND DISCUSSION", "content": "With the rise in similar symptoms across various individuals, accurately diagnosing diseases has become a challenge. However, by leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can detect diseases with considerable precision based on the symptoms provided. This technique can be applied in both web and mobile applications. Users input their symptoms, and the system analyzes this data to identify the most probable disease, subsequently offering recommendations for precautions and suitable diets.\n\nA robust dataset, sourced from platforms such as Kaggle (consisting of 400 samples), is used to classify diseases into different categories. Based on the identified disease, the system suggests precautionary steps and dietary modifications. The data is split into 70% for training and 30% for testing, ensuring that the model is well-validated and capable of providing accurate predictions.\n\nOnce the machine learning model processes the symptoms entered by the user, it detects the corresponding disease and offers recommendations as illustrated in above Figures. This approach provides immediate health suggestions and helps monitor health trends across different age groups and demographics.\n\nGradient Boosting is a machine learning technique known for its high accuracy, particularly because it builds strong predictive models by combining several weak learners, such as decision trees. In the case of disease detection, Gradient Boosting is highly effective as it iteratively improves model performance by learning from previous mistakes at each step. Unlike other algorithms, Gradient Boosting is well-suited for complex and multi-dimensional data, making it a superior choice for detecting diseases where symptoms can vary widely between individuals. It excels at handling noisy and imbalanced datasets, common in healthcare applications, and effectively uncovers non-linear patterns in the data, leading to more accurate predictions.\n\nBy progressively minimizing errors, Gradient Boosting offers a more reliable prediction, making it ideal for disease detection systems that recommend relevant precautionary measures and dietary adjustments to users.", "sections": [{"title": "Gradient Boosting Parameters:", "content": null}, {"title": "Performance metrics:", "content": "Accuracy is used to measure the performance of the model\n$Acc = \\frac{TP + TN}{TN + TP + FN + FP}$                                                                                                                         (1)\n$recall = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$                                                                                                                         (2)\n$Precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$                                                                                                                          (3)\n\nFrom the Figure it is proved that our Gradient boosting method is more suitable for detecting the disease of any person by providing symptoms with 95% validation accuracy whereas Na\u00efve Bayes yields 92%, Random Forest yields 88%, SVM yields 90% and KNN yields 85%.

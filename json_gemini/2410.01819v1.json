Al's reliance on data for machine learning and smart applications raises significant issues around data privacy and security. Governments worldwide can learn from the rapid AI-enabled business innovations in leading nations and play a pivotal role in developing contextually aware business strategies and governance in the AI era. For instance, AI applications in agribusiness can promote sustainable production through real-time data monitoring, while in healthcare, AI can assist in complex decision-making and enhance the quality of care.\nThis paper aims to synthesize AI governance approaches, strategic themes, and enablers and challenges for AI adoption by reviewing existing surveys and literature from academic, government, and industry sources. The key contribution is the development of an EPIC (Education, Partnership, Infrastructure, Community) framework, which maps AI implementation requirements to fully realize social impacts and public good from successful and sustained AI deployment. Through a multi-perspective content analysis of the leading nations' latest AI strategy documents, this paper provides a structured comparison of AI governance strategies across nations. The findings offer valuable insights for governments, academics, industries, and communities to enable responsible and trustworthy AI deployments.\nThe EPIC framework emphasizes the importance of education and training to build Al literacy and skills, fostering partnerships for research and development, establishing robust infrastructure for data and AI, and ensuring community impact through responsible AI innovations. By addressing these areas, the framework aims to guide the development of AI strategies that are ethical, transparent, and beneficial to society."}, {"title": "2 LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Existing reviews on national Al strategies have identified current and emerging themes and similarities across different countries. For example, Bareis [2] analyzed 14 AI policy documents from China, the USA, France, and Germany published between Dec-2017 and Jun-2021 to investigate how to integrate AI tech into the functioning and structures of society. All these nations have established AI as inevitable and massively disrupting technological development, building on the grand legacy and international competition as rhetorical devices. The composition for Al policy narratives is similar, emphasizing leadership intervention and articulation of opportunities and national pathways. However, their objectives and interpretations of AI are different due to the countries' vast cultural, political, and economic differences.\nFatima et al. [4] analyzed 34 national strategic plans published between Oct-2016 and Jan-2020 to understand the prominence of identified key themes by quantifying the number of national strategies covering these themes. The first two key themes are the top priority of public sector functions and industries for AI. The next key theme is data as a critical ingredient for Al systems, enabling the development of algorithms and systems' outputs. Al's performance is largely affected by the data used to train algorithms. AI thrives on large datasets in various forms and from multiple sources. Therefore, the key concerns are data exchange, regulations, privacy, and security. Similarly, Radu [14] analyzed 12 national strategies of South Korea, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Finland, China, UAE, France, the UK, Sweden, Germany, and the US published between April 2016 and Febr-2019. The analysis underlined that the preferred Al policy development recipe is uniting the political will and public resources with the industry interests. Therefore, AI industry growth is desired, enabled, and facilitated by the government but may result in imposed limitations on Al development and implementation, such as ethical issues, making it hard to disentangle public interest policies from market dominance interests.\nSchiff [15] analyzed 112 AI ethics documents from public, private, and NGO organizations worldwide published between January 2016 to July 2019 and social media and news collected from the fall of 2018 to early 2020. The analysis showed that all organizations have a common interest in ethical topics and reveal organizational differences in the ethical framing of several key issues, including the perceived scope of responsibility, the role of experts and the public, and the tension between economic and other values. The public sector has stronger attention on economic growth and unemployment, NGOs have a broader range of ethics topics covered, and the private sector has higher relative priority on social responsibility and trust. Zuiderwijk [24] analyzed the implications of AI use in public governance and research agenda from 26 pieces of literature from 2018 to 2020. The analysis identified themes from the potential benefits of AI use in government: and challenges of AI use, namely.\nExisting reviews on AI adoptions have identified the motivations, enablers, and barriers within different countries and continents' public and private sectors. Stanford's AI Index Report [23] was based on most up-to-date and comprehensive report on the state of AI R&D, technical performance, technical AI ethics, the economy and education, AI policy and governance. The key takeaways are: 1) US and China dominated cross-country collaborations measured by joint Al publications, 2) Industry-affiliated researchers contributed 71% more publications year-over-year at ethics-focused conferences, 3) nine out of ten state-of-the-art AI systems are trained with big data since 2021, 4) AI-related bills increased significantly in 25 countries, particularly, Spain, UK, and US.\nIBM's adoption report [6] was based on a poll conducted from 30 March to 12 April 2022 on a representative sample of 7502 business decision makers with a mix of seniority, 500 in each country from the US, China, India, UAE, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, Canada, UK, Italy, Spain, France, and Germany, and 1000 from Latin America including Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. The top themes of AI are automation and skills, building trust, and making businesses sustainable. The analysis studied the key themes, drivers, and barriers for AI adoption. Similarly, Mikalef [11] analyzed survey data collected between October 2020 and January 2021 from municipalities in Europe, including Norway (71%), Germany (22%), and Finland 7%), with target respondents chief digital officers (65%) and higher-level tech managers (35%) in municipalities. The analysis highlighted that the critical determinant factors for fostering AI capabilities, including perceived benefits, organizational factors, and perceived pressure and incentives citizen from government. Furthermore, Vial [20] analyzed interview data of key AI leaders from industry within North American countries and Al professionals working in different contexts. The analysis emphasized that Al developments to bring solutions out of the lab will only succeed if organizations manage data access throughout the development and production life cycle.\nFinally, OECD's report [13] examined key factors that determine the AI readiness ranking, focusing on four topics: governance, infrastructure and data, skills and education, government, and public services. In addition, they developed five imperatives for harnessing the power of low-cost prediction based on the economics of AI and called for a unified effort to move forward and reduce the knowledge gap between scientific and interdisciplinary efforts."}, {"title": "3 ANALYSIS OF NATIONAL AI STRATEGIES", "content": "A key benefit of learning from national strategies is to see through a third-party view the interests and considerations of Al focusing on the public good, as most governments see themselves as the catalyst, enabler, and regulator for AI developments and deployments. This Section discusses the data collection process, data analysis, and the results from analyzing leading nations' AI strategic documents.\n3.1 Selecting the leading nations\nA combined ranking method is applied for selecting the leading nations based on the top-10 ranked countries from existing multi-factors analysis of Al capacity scoring. Combining the multi-ranking system ensures that the leading nations are determined based on key performance metrics in the last five to ten years and combined from reputable sources. A country gets scored based on the ranking from each source, with 10 being the highest score and 0 being the lowest score if not for ranked within the top 10. For example, rank-1 is scored 10, while rank-10 scored 1. As shown in Table 3, the top-ranked countries included in our study have been included in the top-10 from at least two ranking sources, except The Netherlands, due to their high (88.2%) percentage of internationally collaborative articles (international articles % as reported by Nature index) in the field, higher than that of Italy, Spain, South Korea, Singapore, and India. Table 4 provides the details of the national AI strategy documents (data collected) for analysis, sorted from the oldest to the most recently published. The followings summarize the ranking methodologies from each source.\nOxford's overall Government Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index 2018/2019 used eleven input metrics grouped under four high-level clusters: governance, infrastructure, and data; skills and education; and government and public services. The data is based on desk research and databases such as the number of registered AI start-ups and the UN eGovernment development index indices. URL: https://www.oxfordinsights.com/ai-readiness2019.\nNature's Index for top-25 countries or territories in artificial intelligence ranked by total article share in the field from 2015 to 2019, indicating the percentage of internationally collaborative articles in the field. URL: https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2020-ai/tables/countries.\nStanford's AI Vibrancy scores are based on normalized scores from a comprehensive desk review of 2017 to 2021 data on the economy and R&D pillars. These include commercialization (private investment, number of newly funded companies), R&D outputs (total number of journal and conference papers, and repository publications, and the total number of citations from each type of publications), R&D impact (total patent filing and granted, annual h-index), and Skills: relative AI skills, AI talent concentration. URL: https://aiindex.stanford.edu/vibrancy.\nScimago's country ranking is determined by the author's origin from publications, calculated as the number of documents, citable documents, citations, self-citations, citations per document, and h-index from 1996-2021.

Al ecosystem is the digital and societal infrastructure, including processes, policy, and skills. The environment for AI is collective across all stakeholders with different interests, concerns, and priorities. Therefore, national capacity for enabling the Al ecosystem and increasing the efficacy of AI solutions is essential to realize intelligent systems' socioeconomic and environmental benefits.\nThe top nations in AI have the imperatives (i.e., government pressure) to maintain their leadership in the field. For example, the president's executive order for a concerted effort to promote and protect AI technology and innovation in the country to maintain American leadership in AI [USA]. The next-generation AI development plan aims to accelerate the construction of an innovative nation and global power in science and technology, seizing the major strategic opportunity of Al developments, which builds on the \"first-mover\" advantage [China]. The key ambition is to maintain a global Al superpower by leading the world through a research and innovation powerhouse, a hive of global talent, and a progressive regulatory and business environment [UK].\nObjectives: All the leading nations' AI strategies emphasize the role of government as the catalyst to coordinate the efforts of government, industry, academics, and society in increasing the efficacy of AI solutions to be adopted. The government plays a critical role in improving the national capacity and its international standing in enabling the AI ecosystem, including the digital and societal infrastructure, processes, policy, and skills, which are essential for Al adoption. While each country has specific objectives for enabling the AI ecosystem, all countries placed data as equally important as AI, noting that combining data and AI capabilities will directly contribute to the country's vision and mission. The followings will discuss each of the country's specific focus to provide a view of the differences and similarities of the leading nation's goals and strategies for AI (listed in alphabetical order)."}, {"title": "3.3 Analysis of Key Themes and Concepts Clusters", "content": "For content analysis and identification of the key concepts, themes, and passages within the collection of national strategic documents, Leximancer was used as a text analytics tool to produce a conceptual map that provides a bird's eye view, representing the main concepts and their relationships. The tool helped identify the top themes of the full documents of all the leading nations' AI strategy documents. The concepts were identified automatically with no limit to reveal diverse topics. The compound concepts were set based on manual discoveries after ten initial runs: \"AI and algorithms,\" \"data and based,\" \"information or data,\" \"public and policy and innovation,\" \"R&D or (research and development),\" \"system or systems,\" and \"AI or Artificial Intelligence.\" By combining the top five concepts for each nation, we identified the top-60 concepts. Then, they were used for the visualized analysis of the top four themes and concepts as depicted in Figure 1. It demonstrates \"data\" is a central theme that overlaps with all other themes. Hence, by analyzing the documents with data as the central theme, we can do a focused analysis that overlaps with all other key topics.\n\"Industrial\" is a concept that overlaps between AI, technology, and data, which can be interpreted as industrial applications of Al needs data and technology. Similarly, \"use\" is the concept that overlaps between AI, data, and government, which can be interpreted as the use of data in Al being regulated by the government. Data overlap with technology in terms of being interdependent for \"used, based, and resource\u201d-for example, data-based technology. Data overlap with the government in terms of \"knowledge, skills, researchers, specific,\" as the government has a significant role in supporting training of specific skills and knowledge for data researchers. AI and technology overlap in terms of the \"science, computing, systems, and the world\" as the technological science and systems of AI must be world-class to be competitive and reliable. Finally, AI and government overlap in terms of the \"research, national, ecosystem, business, funding, work, applications,\" as the government must support the funding, ecosystem, and work that supports the national research ecosystem and applications.\nLeximancer identified the top five hits, whereby data that overlaps with the related concepts: 1) educative policies for gender equality, 2) fostering technology capacities in strategic digital value chains and enhanced cybersecurity, 3) social welfare and sustainability underpin AI deployment, 4) networks and collaborations, 5) AI training for interdisciplinarity."}, {"title": "3.4 Data-focused Strategies for AI", "content": "We identified the recommendations (best practice, patterns) and things to address (issues and anti-patterns) by analyzing Leximancer's identified favorable and unfavorable sentiment-analyzed passages about data - passages are the set of sentences where data and sentiment-related concepts co-occur. We focused on extracting each passage into a list of actions or strategies and clustering them into thematic paragraphs before grouping them into key headings. Figure 2 depicts the distribution of the data-focused strategies in terms of which countries covered them and how many passages from the national Al documents were analyzed to identify these strategies. This section will list the recommendations while referencing the source documents, noted by the countries instead of the citation.\n3.4.1. Data Sharing for (balanced) Public/Social Good and Privacy Governance\nTheme-1: Make data a common good whereby the government acts as a trusted third party for public authorities to introduce new ways of producing, sharing, and governing data and encouraging economic players to share and pool their data, and supporting public auditing by incentivizing the public to make data available for research [France, USA, Singapore, UK, Australia]. Review the law to enable \"the data of public interest\" as a form of \"private open data\" that is relevant for the efficient operation of the market and in public policy of public interest. Create collective rights concerning data to bridge the gap between analyzing hidden trends and behavior and their effects on societies and individuals. Identify the technical and \"public good\" challenge, as AI technologies need high-quality data for training, testing, and interactive dynamic testbeds and simulation environments. Enable (data) actors that already hold valuable datasets and resources while simultaneously observing commercial and individual rights and interests in the data. Manage data as strategic national assets to secure access to high-quality datasets. Specify the government's approach to unlocking the power of data through the national data strategy, including access to quality and representative data for robust and effective Al systems. \u2022Assign Central Digital and Data Office to consolidate core policy and strategies for data foundations and work with expert cross-sector partners to improve the government's use and reuse of data to support data-driven innovation in the public sector. Adopt effective policies and programs and improve service delivery and research outcomes to enhance the government's use of data to benefit the citizens.\nTheme-2: Release data to support leadership in the field and prevent critical sectors from becoming overtaken by foreign stakeholders [France, UK, the Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, USA]. Develop and implement standards, tests, and measurement methods to make AI tech more reliable, usable, and interoperable, making decisions based on models built using data. Improve data foundations in the private and third sectors through the National AI R&I program and Open Government License to lead best practices in FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data while growing the intellectual and Infrastructure capacities needed to make the best use of the healthy national data ecosystem for accelerating Al development and adoption pathways. Ensure knowledge, tools, and training modules available for the responsible use of data. Apply the internationally accepted and verifiable FAIR principles to ensure the standards, tools, and training per domain or sector. Address the urgent need to increase the speed of growth in the effective use of big data, knowledge, and computing resources and increase AI applications contributing to social implementation. Use data across its lifecycle, from problem statement definition to exploitation. Address the need for vetted and openly available datasets with identified provenance to enable reproducibility and confident advancement in data-intensive science.\nTheme-3: Address the silo effect from the lack of forward-looking and cross-cutting thinking, which leads to isolated prioritization of systems incompatible with future AI developments. Silo logic also includes fear of losing control, which hampers the circulation of data [France].\nTheme-4: Review the privacy act to ensure that it is suitable in the context of more personal information about individuals being captured and processed and empower consumers to protect their data [Australia, France, USA, UK, Netherlands]. For example, Australian Data Strategy specifies how the government will enhance the effective, safe, and secure use of data and provide a greater understanding of government policy. \u2022Users need appropriate tools and services to manage technical relations and transfer personal data from one service to another. Make privacy methods sufficiently explainable and transparent to help researchers make them safe, efficient, and accurate and remain mindful of dangers from data access. Explore privacy-enhancing technologies that can remove barriers to data sharing by managing risks from sharing commercially sensitive and personal data and new directives to explicitly allow the collection and processing of sensitive and protected data to monitor and mitigate bias in Al systems. Collect large-scale data to give companies more information about consumer behavior and the most effective nudges to change that behavior.\nTheme-4: Establish a democratic data characteristics balance between personal implications and the public good through ethical and legal standards [Spain, France]. AI improves transparency and public activity disclosure, using applications adapted to individual needs, thus enabling technology to enhance the quality of life. For example, increase speed and accuracy of historical personal health data processing for diagnosis, allowing early detection of anomalies. \u2022Launch and accelerate \"data for social good project\" to stimulate the use and good governance of public and private data. It will generate social and public benefits through open data, citizen-generated data, and government-to-citizen data to streamline processes to enhance the quantity and quality of public participation in government.\nTheme-5: Develop mechanisms to ease the government's adoption of Al systems with greater emphasis on data privacy, security, and other specific concerns [USA, Singapore, Canada, Spain, Germany, Netherlands]. For example, the formation of a task force to perform a horizontal scan across government agencies to find application areas within agencies and determine the concerns to be addressed for enabling adoption Modify data acquisition processes across agencies to incorporate specific requirements for AI standards in 'request for proposal' and encourage communities to engage in standards development and adoption, including good practices that foster healthy competition between tech developers, such as community-based benchmarking (like TREC) and lower barriers and strengthen incentives to make training and testing data accessible. Establish digital and data infrastructure to enable national transformation drives for government, society, and the economy. Establish reliable data flow, Infrastructure, pipelines, and structured and unstructured data storage. For example, data-driven insights for teachers to design learning. Initiate high-performance, efficient, secure, trustworthy, and sovereign public-private federated data infrastructure to fully enable cloud computing providers to comply with European quality and performance standards (like GAIA-X). Ensure computing power and (local or remote) data processing necessary for practical AI applications. Compare greater infrastructural requirements for Al services with cloud/software-as-a-service systems due to the need for accessing expensive high-performance computing and large datasets for developing and deploying some Al models.\nTheme-6: Combining data from an effective coordinated collection by different parties will enable Al applications to contribute toward better work processes within government organizations and better societal solutions [Netherlands, Italy]. The availability of usable and shareable high-quality data is crucial for developing high-quality and reliable AI applications, such as assisting car manufacturers in identifying faulty cars and doctors in making better diagnoses. High-quality data is measured by accuracy, completeness, representativeness, timeliness, verifiability, and risk of bias. Increase the quality and lower the cost of customer services through a higher level of personalization.\nTheme-7: Develop techniques for visualization and human-AI interfaces [USA]. Better visualization and user interfaces are additional areas that need much greater development to help humans understand large-volume modern datasets and information from various sources. Visualization and user interfaces must present increasingly complex data and information derived from them in a human-understandable way\n3.4.2. Data for Sustainability Goals\nTheme-8: Develop AI-enabled ecological solutions using open public data through public-private partnerships for data on weather, agriculture, transport, energy, biodiversity, climate, waste, land registry, and energy performance assessments [France, Netherlands, France, Japan, Korea, Germany, Spain]. Provide access to sensitive data for specific applications to address sectoral challenges. For example, auxiliary power unit data can make flight operations more reliable and lower maintenance costs. Release the data for ecological transitions will enable AI to contribute toward the greening process. Deep mind-enabled energy consumption in data and cooling systems. Al can support the intelligent ecological transition to championing sustainable and ecological ecosystems enabled by academic ecosystems, research, and a wealth of data.\n3.4.3. Data Collaborations and Ecosystem for Research, Development, and Innovation\nTheme-9: Renew equipment to improve performance to keep up with data growth [France, Germany]. New computer architecture, with more efficient use of cloud computing, and highly energy-efficient computing and memory, such as neuromorphic systems, can reduce the need for centralized data but increase the demand for equipment renewal. In addition, larger computing and storage spaces provide better energy efficiency than smaller data centers. Establishing a national supercomputing center considers resource efficiency and industry use possibilities while anticipating future peak demand for Al applications and large data volumes analysis. s\nTheme-10: Research to improve the efficiency of data techniques to address the integrity, improve data quality, and a new way to extract data and metadata simultaneously [USA]. It includes methods and approaches for data cleaning, knowledge discovery, discovering anomalies and inconsistencies, and incorporating human feedback. Research to enable machine learning algorithms to learn from high-velocity data, including distributed ML that learn simultaneously from multiple data pipelines, and for the Al systems to intelligently prioritize and sample data from large-scale simulations, experimental instruments, and distributed sensor systems\nTheme-11: Apply machine learning to encrypted data with high throughput and accuracy [USA, France, Spain]. \u2022Advancing hardware (such as sensors) and algorithms to 1) enable robust and reliable perception, capturing data at longer distances, higher resolution, and in real-time; 2) improve data-intensive Al methods; and 3) responsive controlled data pipelines throughout distributed systems for immediate data availability. These will enable Al development to create new sectors of the economy and revitalize industries. Adopting Al's fundamental technologies can drive profound economic impact and quality of life improvements. The tightly interwoven Infrastructure of emerging technologies such as 5G for big data and the strengths of universities to enable high-performance computing, cybersecurity, and digital-enabling technologies will address intense digitalization and technological developments. Hardware such as GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology enables efficient AI techniques to use increasing amounts of large data. \u2022DARPA launched a multiyear investment in the \"AI Next\" campaign to improve the robustness and reliability of Al systems, enhance the security and resilience of machine learning tech, reduce power, data, and performance inefficiencies, and pioneering next-generation explainable AI algorithms and applications. Foundational investments to drive machine learning includes data provenance and quality, novel software and hardware paradigms, and the security of AI systems.\nTheme-12: Form situational awareness through integrated data from perception, including geometric, location, and velocity attributes [USA, Singapore, Japan, France]. This will provide Al systems with 1) comprehensive knowledge and 2) a model of the world to plan and execute tasks effectively and safely. Use AI (natural language processing and machine learning) to transform unstructured data into reliable, contextualized data sources for corporations. Build a\nTheme-13: Establish interactions between academia and the private sector and government funding to enable innovations to improve accuracy in Al models, such as reduced error rate in speech recognition and enabled real-time translation [USA].\nTheme-14: Create the right conditions for high-quality and leading AI research and innovation with excellent training, talents for living and working with AI, and more usable data for enabling AI application developments [Netherlands, UK]. Enable high-quality digital and intelligent connectivity, measured by latency, data rate, and reliability. Specific applications, such as self-driving cars, need significantly large high-quality data and hence require high reliability and low latency digital connectivity. Likewise, Augmented and Virtual Reality applications require a high data rate and low latency. Skills, data, and infrastructure investments will enable AI study and cutting-edge research.\nTheme-15: Facilitate collaborations between firms and scale commercialization by driving innovation and the digital economy's governance using common, adaptable frameworks, such as industry standards and conformity assessments, to provide clear guidelines and best practices from internal data governance and analytics practices [Canada, UK]. Provide supports for affordable Intellectual Property (IP) advice or centralized IP education and digital infrastructure, including legal and technical infrastructure for data sharing, affordable broadband, data storage and processing, and high-performance computing. Work across government agencies and businesses to tackle complex undefined problems and explore legacy data use to enable the translation of fundamental scientific discoveries into real-world applications.\nTheme-16: Establish the basis of the Al ecosystem on secure and sovereign data infrastructure to ensure competitiveness while skilling citizens to deal with AI applications confidently in various situations [Germany, France, Netherlands]. Address the problem that although a company with a wealth of data history becomes a potential purchaser of AI solutions, it may need help in 1) formalizing its requirements and 2) identifying stakeholders that can provide them with solutions. IP rights to Al systems are complex due to the components. For example, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between data and algorithms, as both are often called \"code.\" Once a platform achieves a powerful position, its self-reinforcing processes can make it challenging for SMEs and startups to catch up.\nTheme-17: Attain international competitiveness through next-generation AI technology, R&D, and deployment, and form openly compatible, stable, and mature technological systems [China]. Research, establish, and operate vehicle automatic driving and road coordination technology systems. Research and develop information and integrated data platforms for transportation under complex multi-dimensional conditions.\n3.4.4. Data Security and Protection\nTheme-18: Guarantee personal data protection through legally robust agreement and sufficiently robust framework for businesses [France, Netherlands]. \u2022 Legislation on data protection only regulates Al algorithms, as they are primarily based on personal data, and their results affect individuals directly. There are many efforts to standardize data in the healthcare sector, such as the Basic Data Set for Care initiative.\nTheme-19: Collect high-quality data and keep it safe from cyber-attacks and other risks, including innovative ways of safeguarding data while facilitating practical usage and accelerating data-driven research [Japan, Singapore, USA]. \u2022High-quality data is enabled by a smarter research environment and a data platform to accumulate them. Identify how data pre-processing and additional analysis impact data quality."}, {"title": "3.4.5. Data Quality and its Fair and Safe Use", "content": "Theme-23: Develop new metrics for data performance, interoperability, usability, safety (prevention against harm), privacy, confidentiality, traceability, and fairness (against potential bias) [France, India, Spain, USA, Canada, Germany]. \u2022Policymakers rely on standards (as agile regulatory instruments) to keep pace with innovation, evolving data practices, and societal expectations. Under GDPR, preserving confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of the processing systems and services requires the best encryption practices or coarsen data resolution to mask and de-identify personal/sensitive data. The private sector safely develops Al solutions, products, and services while applying best practices for security and data quality. For the public sector, optimize the quality of analysts-based public policies using simulations. \u2022Develop and standardize testing methodologies and metrics, provide objective data to benchmark, and effectively track and evaluate the advancements aimed at strategic scenarios. Increasing AI dataset availability is essential for researchers to use actual operational data to model and run experiments on real-world systems and scenarios. For example, NIST developed comprehensive standard test methods and the associated performance metrics to statistically assess emergency response robots' critical capabilities. The government will foster data quality assurance through benchmark tests, reference data, and setting up the data for validating algorithms to ensure reliable AI methods. Design tasks, incentive structures, and feedback mechanisms to ensure accurate and unbiased annotation.\nTheme-24: Check fairness and equity by testing the large quantity of the system's user profiles against various false input data according to precise guidelines, such as checking the gender equity of a recruitment website. For example, auditors can obtain accurate data on male-female discrimination in the workplace [France].\nTheme-25: Implement data quality verification and assurance and propose an international standard for AI life cycle and quality assurance that includes data [Japan, USA, Korea, Germany, UK]. Prioritize improvements to access and quality of AI data and models from the AI research community's feedback. Inherit AI vulnerabilities and performance requirements when AI components are connected to other systems and information safely and securely. Follow applicable laws and regulations, carry out dataset development, and ethically share while recognizing risks associated with inappropriate use, inaccurate or inappropriate disclosure, and limitations in data de-identification techniques (hence privacy and confidentiality are not ensured). Establish standard data for clinical verification and a professional review system to improve the quality of AI medical devices and speed up the commercialization process. The government must strengthen science-based quality criteria for medical study designs, bolster research funding on specific AI in healthcare challenges, and develop the infrastructure of universities. The infrastructure will ensure quick and wide availability of standardized, high-quality health-relevant data that enable Al-driven health research. One of the largest centralized collections of"}, {"title": "3.4.6. Data Skills and Education", "content": "Theme-29: Establishing an institute for continuing professional development for businesses and researchers across disciplines, including hiring postdoctoral researchers, is as essential as traditional bachelor/master education for sharing data, experience, and best practices for validating AI solutions [France, Singapore]. Integrate talent, data, regulation, and effective deployments across departments to fully realize the positive impact of AI.\nTheme-30: Address gender balance of the science and tech sectors' workforce, which can result in unconscious bias in algorithms [France, Netherlands, Canada]. Grow both male and female Al experts and data professionals to support the rapid growth of AI and computer science programs. Lack of (gender) diversity can result in algorithms that produce cognitive biases in the system design, data analysis, and interpretation of results. Investment in Al research (the core focus of Al strategy) needs to be supported by a strong, equitable, and accountable data-centric talent pipeline to commercialize and govern responsible innovation and sustainable, inclusive growth of industrial AI.\nTheme-31: Strengthen students' academic qualifications with Al expertise and improve the quality and performance of higher education through responsible use of AI, fostering innovation through big data and AI-enabled development of university courses and learning design settings [Germany, Netherlands]. \u2022Address how AI and computer science education programs are growing so rapidly that it is difficult to accommodate the growth."}, {"title": "3.5 Analysis of Strategic Themes", "content": "Based on a thematic analysis of Leximancer's generated passages on \"data and related concepts", "a set of strategic themes were derived. These themes have been checked to be consistent with the executive summaries and can encompass (overarching) all the key concepts within the data-focused AI strategies, as discussed in Section 3.4. Given that there were 3414 passages, the key themes of key action items could be identified within the first 150 passages, after noting some of the passages of #121 onwards were becoming quite repetitive. Therefore, we refined the initial structure and thematic list of action items based on the next passages but stopped at passage #221 after no further refinement was needed.\nThis section will detail the Strategic Themes from the leading nations, forming the future mapping of AI strategy": "nE: Education and training reform", "sectors.\nP": "Partnerships for R&D&I collaboration between government", "deployment.\nI": "Infrastructure of technology", "researchers.\nC": "Community impact from Al innovations that promote the public good, including ecological agenda, energy efficiency for storage, and green computing, promoting a technological future underlined by sustainability-focused AI maturity, including Infrastructure, collaborations, and education.\nAs shown in Figure 3, the pyramid of \"EPIC\" strategic themes signifies that the foundation of AI maturity starts with an education that enables meaningful partnership, which is critical to building the infrastructure for quality deployment. At the top of the pyramid, community-driven Al innovation is the capstone for Al maturity. There is an emerging call for increased \"AI for good\" that promotes social, sustainability, and ecological agenda.\nThe first fundamental and underlying requirement for AI adoption is literacy, skills, and expertise for data, AI, and related technologies through education, training, and reform. If society is unaware of AI capabilities, they are less likely to be receptive to AI adoption and support new applications and solutions deployments. Therefore, a sustained pipeline of skills and expertise to develop Al is critical for enabling the next strategies. The next layer strategy (on top of education) is partnership and cooperation between skilled players to advance AI applications' technological readiness level for quality deployment via translational outcomes of cutting-edge research, development, and innovation process underpinned by interdisciplinary collaborations. The next layer strategy (on top of the partnership) is establishing infrastructure for data and AI, which is essential to support trustworthy AI application developments driven by the partnership's stakeholders' common values, mission, and objectives. Hence, a partnership is a critical requirement for motivating meaningful collaborative efforts in bringing together the infrastructure of people, technology, and policy, as every player from academia, industry, government, and society has a key role to play in bringing these components together and build"}]}

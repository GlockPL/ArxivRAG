It explores how Google's system \npreferentially favors a limited number of news outlets. Utilizing algorithm auditing tech- \nniques, the research measures source concentration with the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index \n(HHI) and Gini coefficient, revealing significant concentration trends. The study under- \nscores the importance of conducting horizontal analyses across multiple search queries, as \nfocusing solely on individual results pages may obscure these patterns. Factors such as \npopularity, political bias, and recency were evaluated for their impact on news rankings. \nFindings indicate a slight leftward bias in search outcomes and a preference for popular, \noften national outlets. This bias, combined with a tendency to prioritize recent content, \nsuggests that Google's algorithm may reinforce existing media inequalities.

It allows for a wide range of opinions to \nbe heard, which is essential for a well-informed public, and aids the reception of diverse ideas [1], [2]. In \nthe digital age, part of that diversity comes from having an ecosystem of multiple outlets with different \nideologies and framings to expose people to various viewpoints. However, this will only work if the content \nactually gets to readers. News distribution, therefore, plays a crucial role in this process [3, pp. 248, 254\u2013257]. \nAlgorithms increasingly mediate the distribution of news. The digital age brought an uptick in the offering of \ninformation, and these systems are intermediaries in content discovery. Their behavior can have a significant \nimpact on what people see [4, pp. 177\u2013203], [5], [6, pp. 1683\u20131685]. Given their important role, it is necessary \nto investigate how they might affect news distribution. \nThe importance of ensuring news diversity in these systems is twofold. It fosters a healthy news ecosystem \nby exposing readers to a variety of content, and the web traffic generated from the exposure brings economic \nbenefits to publishers [3, p. 248], [7, p. 13]."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Search engines are crucial and act as gatekeepers in this process, as most readers reach news websites \nthrough them [8], [5], [9, p. 50], [10, p. 210]. Google is an undisputed leader in this field, with over 90% of \nmarket share worldwide [11], [12]. \nIn the literature regarding diversity in the media, this is related to the idea of exposure diversity: the variety of \ncontent and viewpoints that readers access, which goes through exposing audiences to different sources [13, \np. 149], [14, p. 24], [2, p. 330]. By displaying news in its results, Google diverts readers' attention to the \noutlets and articles it curates [7, p. 3]. \nWhile previous research has identified biases in these search engines [6], [15], [7], these analyses often \nhave limitations in scope, such as focusing solely on the US or English-language content, or examining a \nnarrow set of queries. This paper extends the literature by investigating the presence of biases in the news \ndistribution in Google Search through algorithm auditing techniques in Brazil, the UK, and the US [16, p. 6], \nusing metrics that have been explored in this context in the past (such as popularity and political bias) and \nincorporating new ones: information quality and the number of articles each outlet published on a given \ntopic. By extracting data from the \"News\" tab in Google Search over 21 days, it analyzed 143,976 results \nrelated to 2,298 search queries and 4,296 outlets. Key parts of the findings were validated on an additional \ndataset collected over 12 days, with 77,887 results. The analysis shows high market concentration in Google \nSearch's algorithm outputs, along with biases relating to the sources' popularity and political stance, and the \ncontent's recency."}, {"title": "2.1 News Diversity and Algorithms Mediating News Consumption", "content": "Diversity is widely regarded as desirable in news ecosystems and crucial for democratic processes [17, p. 2], \n[1], [2], [14, p. 1]. Its components include diversity of sources (news organizations), content (viewpoints and \nideas) and exposure (consumption) [3, pp. 247\u2013248], [14, p. 10]. Ensuring diversity is one goal that drives \npolicy in this area, and in recent years these have turned their attention to exposure diversity \u2014the diversity of \ncontent and viewpoints that readers actually access [13, p. 149], [14, p. 24]. \nThe distinction between internal diversity (within media outlets) and external diversity (between media \noutlets) becomes particularly relevant in this context as, with more niche and partizan media appearing, \nthe latter helps ensure balance [2, p. 330], [3, p. 251], [18, p. 179]. In a scenario where audiences that were \nonce choosing from a small number of publications then have an excess of choices for content [3, p. 251], \n[18, p. 179], the abundance of content can paradoxically lead to polarization if users expose themselves to \nlike-minded information instead of diverse sources [2, p. 330], [3, p. 252]. Therefore, ensuring that diverse \ncontent gets to people is crucial for the diversity of the news ecosystem to be effective. \nReaders increasingly rely on tech platforms like Facebook and Google to access news content instead of \ngoing directly to news websites. These \"side-door\" routes are particularly popular with younger audiences \nand are becoming more common over time [19, p. 10], with search engines accounting for 17% to 41% of \ntraffic to news websites, depending on the country [8]. \nWhile algorithms, acting as gatekeepers, help users sort through the information overload common in the \ndigital age, they are not free from bias, despite what some ideas of having these allegedly neutral alternatives \nmight suggest [10, pp. 209\u2013214], [4, p. 182], [5], [9, pp. 45, 49\u201350]. Algorithmic biases might be hidden in \nsystems even for those who develop it [20, p. 331], [21, pp. 11\u201312], [22].

In some, the tech giant supports \ncontent producers, which, in turn, ensure Google has information to show to its users. This support comes in \nthe form of web traffic but also partnerships and funding for news initiatives [40, pp. 116\u2013118], [41, pp. 162, \n166, 171], [42], [43].

Using a \ncomputer in Cambridge (UK), the additional tests involved searching for \"best pizza places\" and examining \nthe results, which were consistent across normal and incognito browsing. After a 10-minute interval, a search \nfor \"Train tickets to Manchester\" was performed in normal browsing mode, followed by a repetition of the \npizza query. This time, a result related to Manchester, which had not appeared before, was shown mid-page \nin both browsing modes. After another 10-minute interval, the pizza query yielded the original results. A \nsimilar methodology was applied to the news tab, where the effect was not observed. Later, the process was \nrepeated using \"traffic\" as the original query, achieving the same results.

The rate of the decay is p where 0 < p < 1, \nand the weight assigned to a URL at position k is calculated as $w_k = p^{k\u22121}$. Here, k is the rank position, and $w_k$ \nis the weight assigned to that position.

This score was extracted from a dataset created by Lin, Lasser, \nLewandowsky, et al. [65] that rates news sources based on their credibility (referred to here as LIN-PC1). \nData for most Brazilian sources was unavailable, so these were removed from this part of the analysis. The \ninformation was available for 1,261 (40.9%) of the 3,082 UK and US sources. These accounted for 65,080 \n(71.6%) results. To mitigate that gap, the analysis ran on publishers with five results or more (above the \nmedian) since those at the bottom often lacked the Lin-PC1 score. \nThe median Lin-PC1 score for the top outlets was 0.78 in the UK and 0.83 in the US, while the rest of the \noutlets had respectively 0.70 and 0.71. Its statistical relevance was assessed by Mann-Whitney U (UK: \nU = 3103.5, p < 0.05; US: U = 4911.5, p < 0.01). This comparison only focuses on results in the Politics \nand Others sections. Including Sports and Entertainment showed a similar pattern but only had statistical \nsignificance in the US (p < 0.01). \nOLS regressions, however, suggest no relationship between the quality rating and an outlet's prevalence \nwhen considering popularity. The results indicate that while the Lin-PC1 metric is significantly (negatively) \nassociated with the number of results when controlling for Open PageRank, its direct association with the \nvolume of entries is not significant. This suggests that the apparent association between higher Lin-PC1 and \nappearing more often in the results may be driven by the relationship between Lin-PC1 and Open PageRank, \nrather than a direct effect.

This considers only the Politics and Others sections, which relate more to such bias than Sports \nand Entertainment. An OLS regression on the scale and the number of results, controlling for popularity \n(Open PageRank), is not statistically relevant. \nMore evidence comes from comparing Google Search to Media Cloud's UK and US data. Results \nin Google gravitate more towards the left categories than Media Cloud's. This pattern relates to a previous \nstudy that also identified this left-leaning pattern in the results in the US when comparing to another baseline \nof news outlets, GDELT [7, p. 9]. This result backs those found previously and shows this phenomenon in \nanother country. \nMoreover, a meaningful relationship exists between political bias and results' rankings. An OLS regression \non the ordered political bias (where lower values relate to the left) was run against the order of the results in \nGoogle. In the US, it found a significant relationship in which a higher political bias scale rating (more to the \nright) means appearing further down in Google's results (p < 0.001).

Given said complexity, some of the \ndiscrepancies found in this investigation hinge on a slight difference or models showing a low R-squared, \nwhich, despite statistically meaningful, only account for a small portion of the variation in the data. Though, \nwith Google's relevance, the tiniest nudge can have a big impact. \nThe results displayed in Google's news tab are mostly balanced vertically but concentrated horizontally. In \nother words, a user who looks for a news topic in Google may see no repeated outlets (this happened in 40% \nof the queries in this audit). The Gini coefficient was low when considering individual queries, indicating \nlow market concentration (section 4.1). However, users who are too dependent on Google for their news \ndiets, as people increasingly are [19], will often see repeated outlets across their queries. This can be seen in \na large Gini overall and relates to research that found these platforms bring more short-term consumption of \ndiverse news sources but limit it in the long term [67]. \nIt should be noted that the low Gini for individual queries is not always true. Some cases of high concentration \nhappen when looking for outlets' names. This could be justified as the users' interest to see mostly CNN \nwhen searching for \"CNN.\" However, others refer to queries on topics such as an Uber driver strike in Brazil, \nfor which five outlets are featured among 50 results (over five iterations). \nGoogle's source concentration had already been demonstrated in another analysis of Google's news results [7]. \nThis analysis shows it goes beyond the US, as the same pattern was identified in the UK, similar to the US \nregarding language and development, and Brazil, with a different language and situated in the Global South. \nThis shows the global nature of Google's impact, a power that extends beyond any publisher's dream [41, \np. 173]. \nIn practice, search engines act as gatekeepers to the content that gets consumed or not on the web, to \nthe point that not being listed in Google can be seen as the same as not existing online [68, p. 21]. By \nnarrowing the options users see, these results might affect the internet's value as a source of information, \nwhich comes from being a democratic and inclusive place that is able to give voice to diverse groups [69, \np. 169], [69, pp. 180\u2013181], [70, p. 11]. The top outlets are already popular (section 5.1). The cost of biased \nsearch mechanisms can be significant for those striving to be found. \nSources that offer quality content but lack popularity might end up neglected. Someone seeking information \nabout a news event may stop their search after finding a suitable story near the top of the list, missing equally \nvaluable options listed further [69, p. 180]. This concentration might go unnoticed by the user; after all, their \ninformation needs were met. However, it might still have the consequence of leaving them systematically \nconsuming from similar sources (relating to the filter-bubble effect [29]) while leaving many potentially \nquality sources unseen."}, {"title": "5.1 Popularity Bias and Distortions", "content": "The concentration privileges certain characteristics.

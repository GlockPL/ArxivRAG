Introduction", "content": "Tool wear represents an inevitable aspect of the cutting pro- cess where the tool is exposed to complex collective loads due to the interplay of multiple physical fields. This interaction leads to the detachment of surface material from the tool, alter- ing its geometry. Such changes significantly influence the qual- ity of the workpiece and the efficiency of the machining pro- cess [1]. Consequently, tool wear condition monitoring is im- portant for ensuring workpiece quality and productivity within advanced manufacturing systems.\nChanges in tool geometry and other characteristics due to tool wear affect the manufacturing process, such as cutting forces, vibration frequencies, etc. On the other hand, recent sen- sor technology and signal processing advances have facilitated the capture of those changes from processes [2] and further contributed to the development of machine learning models for tool wear monitoring, which are trained on historical datasets and estimate tool wear from real-time data inputs [3]. Initial explorations employed various conventional machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests [4, 5], Support Vector Machines [6], and Artificial Neural Networks [7]. These ap- proaches rely on feature engineering to extract relevant features from raw signals. For instance, Wang et al. extracted 54 fea- tures from cutting force and acceleration signals, applying fea- ture dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Regression to estimate current tool wear [8]. However, as monitoring data volume increases, the complexity of feature engineering chal- lenging the real-time applicability of such methods.\nDeep Learning (DL) provides a comprehensive approach for tool wear monitoring by integrating feature extraction and pre- diction, overcoming traditional challenges through its ability to learn feature representations automatically [9]. For example, Li et al. employed a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory net- work to extract deep features from time-series signals for tool wear estimation [10]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are extensively applied to analyze both image and sequence data due to their robust feature extraction capabilities [11]. Yan et al. converted the force and acceleration signals to 2D fre- quency domain signals for CNN-based residual network analy- sis, archieving error margins below 8% [12]. Huang et al. intro- duced a multi-scale CNN with an attention fusion module for more accurate and effective tool wear classification [13]. How- ever, those approaches used randomly sliced test sets, implying that the tools in the test set have been exposed to the models dur- ing training, potentially leading to an overestimation of model performance. Such an approach does not accurately reflect the industrial context of tool wear monitoring, where tools are new and not previously encountered in the training set and the wear progression of each tool is individual."}, {"title": "2. Deep Learning Approach Considering Cutting Parame- ters", "content": "The model is based on a CNN designed to estimate tool wear under specific cutting conditions. The architecture of the model is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe model gets K time series signals of length L obtained from sensors as input. These signals are formatted into an K\u00d7L dimensional signal sequence for processing within the convolu- tion blocks. In the convolution blocks, H available cutting pa- rameters are copied to align with the input time series of length L, generating a parameter sequence of dimensions H\u00d7L. This parameter sequence is subsequently combined with the sig- nal sequence, formed in an (K+H)\u00d7L dimensional parameter- signal sequence that is fed into the convolution unit. The con- volution unit is structured with two one-dimensional convolu- tions, each employing 2N filters, followed by a max pooling op- eration with a pool size of 3. To enhance the prompting of cut- ting parameters to the model, the output from the convolutional unit is then combined with the parameter sequence of the cor- responding length again before entering the next convolutional unit, with this process repeating four times. The final stage of the model consists of global average pooling, dropout, and a dense layer. The model is designed to multiple target values related to tool wear, aiming to enhance both the performance and robustness through the incorporation of multiple detailed tool wear measurements. Detailed descriptions of the input sig- nals and tool wear measurements are deferred to Chapter 3. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the enhanced"}, {"title": "3. Materials and Methods", "content": "This chapter details the experimental setup and data process- ing flow.\n3.1. Experimental setup\nA total of 20 milling experiments (corresponding to 20 tools) were carried out under different cutting parameters, utilizing a 5-axis machining center DMU 85 Monoblock from DMG Mori.\nThe workpiece material was Inconel 718 with dimensions of a 50 mm cube. The uncoated end mill featuring a HM MG10 substrate, four cutting edges, a diameter of 6 mm, and a cor- ner radius of 0.15 mm was employed. Each cut was executed along the X-axis of the machine, covering a 50 mm feed travel. All four peripheral cutting edges of the end mill were inspected after each cut using a DinoLite optical microscope, ensuring a comprehensive documentation of wear development. The cut- ting force components on the workpiece side were measured via a Kistler 9255C Stationary Dynamometer (SD), while the tool-side torque and cutting force components were measured using a Kistler 9170A Rotary Cutting Dynamometer (RCD), both at a 10 kHz sample rate. Additionally, the machine inter- nal signals including spindle torque, spindle current, and aux- iliary drive torque and current were recorded synchronously at a lower sample rate of 100 Hz. The depth and width of cut re- mained constant at 1.5 mm in all experiments. The first 16 sets of experiments were each conducted under consistent cutting parameters, with details provided in Table 1. The last 4 sets in- troduced variations in cutting parameters to further assess the"}, {"title": "3.2. Data preparation", "content": "Data acquired via sensors and microscopes is subjected to preprocessing to ensure its suitability for modeling. Specifi- cally, in a milling operation, which encompasses three distinct phases: cut-in, milling, and cut-out. The milling phase is char- acterized by uniform cutting conditions. Consequently, signal segments pertinent to the milling phase are isolated based on the auxiliary drive position, with only the segments from the last two seconds being selected for model input. The experi- mental setup delineates signal sources into two categories: ex- ternal sensor signals and machine internal signals. External sen- sor signals are equipped with seven signal channels, including tool torque measured by RCD \\(M_T\\), two orthogonal cutting force components from RCD (\\(F_{RCDx}\\) and \\(F_{RCDy}\\)), and two orthogo- nal cutting force components from SD (\\(F_{SDx}\\) and \\(F_{SDy}\\)). The resultant forces, \\(F_{RCDxy}\\) or \\(F_{SDxy}\\), can be computed from the re- spective orthogonal components. On the other hand, machine internal signals comprise eight signal channels, including the spindle torque \\(M_s\\) and the spindle current \\(I_s\\), along with the or- thogonal torques (\\(M_x\\) and \\(M_y\\)) and currents (\\(I_x\\) and \\(I_y\\)) of the auxiliary drive. The resultant torque \\(M_{xy}\\) and current \\(I_{xy}\\) for these signals are also calculated. Given the external sensors' sample rate of 10 kHz, machine internal signals are subjected to linear interpolation to align with the external sensor signal length. Consequently, for each milling operation, the processed external sensor signals results in a signal sequence dimension"}, {"title": "4. Results and Discussion", "content": "In the experiment, a series of 454 milling operations fol- lowed by wear measurements were conducted with 20 tools. The global maximum width of flank wear land \\(VB_{max}\\) was se- lected for evaluation, as it serves as a key indicator for tool re- placement. Model performance was assessed using two primary metrics: the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Coef- ficient of Determination (R2). The model's zero-shot transfer- ability was examined under two distinct scenarios. One where the test sets comprised experiments with fixed cutting parame- ters (the first 16 experiments) and another where the test set in- volved experiments with variable cutting parameters (the last 4 experiments). For comparative analysis, a reference model with identical model architecture but not incorporating cutting pa- rameters was employed as a baseline. This comparison facili- tated a direct assessment of the impact of incorporating cutting parameters on the model's performance and its transferability.\n4.1. Transfer to a fixed cutting parameter\nIn this evaluation scenario, the experimental data were grouped into eight sets based on different cutting parameters. Each set was sequentially designated as the test set, while the remaining sets served as the training set. The model uses all external sensor signals and machine internal signals as inputs. Figure 4 illustrates the comparative performance in tool wear estimation between the test model and a reference model across various test sets. The inclusion of cutting parameters sig- nificantly enhances the test model's performance, yielding a 22.3% improvement in RMSE and a 3.8 % increase in the coef- ficient of determination R2 on average over the reference model. The improvement difference between RMSE and R2 indicates that the reference model is subject to a higher incidence of large"}, {"title": "4.2. Transfer to variable cutting parameters", "content": "In this evaluation scenario, the experimental data of the ini- tial 16 experiments were utilized as the training dataset, while the data of the final four experiments with tool No. 17 to No. 20 constituted the test set. Diverging from the fixed cutting pa- rameters applied in the training set, each tool in the test set was subjected to varying cutting parameters during each cut. Given that the training set contains all eight cutting parameters, the model is theoretically equipped to identify sensor data fea- tures in this scenario. However, the development of tool wear in the test set diverged from the uniform progression observed in the training set, reflecting more realistic industrial applica- tions where tools are subjected to varying cutting parameters throughout their lifecycle. The model leverages both external sensor signals and machine internal signals as input.\nFigure 5 illustrates the wear estimation performance of both the test and reference models for the four tools within the test set. The test model demonstrates an average performance im- provement over the reference model, with an 11.4% reduction in RMSE and a 4.1 % increase in R2. Despite this advantage, the average RMSE for both models exceeds 25 \u00b5m, with the reference model peaking at an RMSE of 47.3 \u00b5m. The compar- ison to the first evaluation scenario indicates a decline in per- formance for both models, and a narrowing in the performance gap, as evidenced by the reduced advantage in RMSE for the test model. This outcome indicates that the test model, despite outperforming the reference model, still encounters large wear estimation errors.\nFigure 6 presents the measured and estimated wear curves for tools No. 19 and No. 20. Initially, a cutting speed of 20 or 30 m/min was applied, leading to a steady wear progression. For tool No. 19, a cutting speed of 40 m/min was utilized be- tween feed travel of 400 to 500 mm, and similarly for tool No. 20, the same cutting speed was applied from 350 to 450 mm feed travel. This resulted in a sharp increase in wear over this 100 mm interval. Subsequently, the cutting speed with stable wear development was used again. It can be observed that the distribution of the estimation errors of both models is not ho- mogeneous. The large errors start to appear during rapid wear growth phases and persists until the end of tool life. Specifi- cally, at a feed travel of 650 mm for tool No. 19, wear was un- derestimated by the reference model, exhibiting errors exceed- ing 50 \u00b5m. Similarly, for tool No. 20, beyond a feed travel of"}, {"title": "5. Conclusion and Outlook", "content": "Changes in cutting conditions during machining lead to vari- ations in process monitoring data distribution, presenting a challenge for accurate tool wear estimation under new con- ditions. Addressing the demand for zero-shot transferability within industrial settings, this study proposes a deep learn- ing approach based on CNN that incorporates cutting condi- tions as extra model inputs. The model's performance is as- sessed through milling experiments conducted under diverse cutting parameters. In comparison to models that omit cutting conditions, our model exhibits superior wear estimation accu- racy and enhanced zero-shot transferability. This advantage is maintained irrespective of the stability of the wear develop- ment or the limitation of the training dataset, underscoring the effectiveness of incorporating cutting conditions as model in- puts to refine wear estimation. This effectiveness enables the model to achieve zero-shot transfer. In practical applications, a model trained on data from a limited set of cutting parame- ters can be directly used to monitor tool wear in manufactur- ing processes without retraining under new cutting parameters. Additionally, the estimated wear values help identify potential geometric errors and facilitate necessary compensations using adaptive methods [16], ensuring the quality of the final product. Future work will aim to broaden the cutting parameter space, thereby extending the model's transferability assessment. Addi- tionally, efforts will be directed towards optimizing the model's architecture to further elevate estimation performance. Lastly, the development of an adaptive design of experiments algorithm will be explored, intending to enhance zero-shot transferability with minimal training data, thereby streamlining the model's applicability in diverse machining contexts."}]}

We have previously developed two robot scientists: 'Adam' (for yeast functional biology), and 'Eve' (for early-stage drug design)). We are now developing a next generation robot scientist Genesis. With Genesis we aim to demonstrate that an area of science can be investigated using robot scientists unambiguously faster, and at lower cost, than with human scientists. Here we report progress on the Genesis project. Genesis is designed to automatically improve system biology models with thousands of interacting causal components. When complete Genesis will be able to initiate and execute in parallel one thousand hypothesis-led closed-loop cycles of experiment per-day. Here we describe the core Genesis hardware: the one thousand computer-controlled \u03bc-bioreactors. For the integrated Mass Spectrometry platform we have developed AutonoMS, a system to automatically run, process, and analyse high-throughput experiments. We have also developed Genesis-DB, a database system designed to enable software agents access to large quantities of structured domain information. We have developed RIMBO (Revisions for Improvements of Models in Biology Ontology) to describe the planned hundreds of thousands of changes to the models. We have demonstrated the utility of this infrastructure by developed two relational learning bioinformatic projects. Finally, we describe LGEM+ a relational learning system for the automated abductive improvement of genome-scale metabolic models.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Background", "content": null}, {"title": "1.1 Automating Science", "content": "The most advanced application of AI for science is the closed-loop automation of scientific research.

These models are central to the future of medicine (humans are eukaryotes), to agriculture (plants are also eukaryotes), and to biotechnology. The yeast S. cerevisiae is the 'model organism' for eukaryotic cells: despite the last common ancestor of humans and yeast living around one billion years ago, most of what is true about yeast is also true for human cells. The medicine Nobel Laureate Leland Hartwell famously said 'yeast are like small humans'. The similarities between yeast and humans mean that often the easiest way to understand how a human gene works is to study its homolog in yeast, as yeast is much easier to work with.\nEven simple model biological system like yeast are incredibly complicated: thousands of genes, proteins, and small-molecules, all interacting together in complicated spatial temporal ways. In addition, Ockham's razor is not a reliable guide in biology, as biological systems evolved over long time periods. Therefore, basic information theory makes clear that a vast number of experiments will be required to derive an understanding of biological systems. Current high-throughput methods are insufficient for systems biology. This is because, even though very large numbers of experiments may be executed, each individual experiment cannot be designed to test a hypothesis about a model, i.e. current high-throughput experiments are not 'hypothesis led'.\nSystems biology presents an extreme challenge to the traditional human based scientific method. Systems biology models are so complex that they are beyond human intuitive understanding. This complexity plays to the strength of AI. Complex modelling is also complicated by what is known in the philosophy of science as 'Duhem Thesis': 'an experiment can never condemn an isolated hypothesis but only a whole theoretical Group' [9]. This makes model refinement and the generation of efficient experiments to test models especially challenging [10]. We argue that AI systems are now better than humans at this. Due to these, and other challenges of systems biology, AI tools are required to aid the execution of the many closed-loop experimental cycles essential to build accurate and comprehensive 21st century system biology models."}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "The overall architecture of Genesis is shown in Fig. 1. With Genesis we aim to demonstrate that an area of science can be investigated unambiguously faster, and at lower cost, using robot scientists than with human scientists. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate a hundred-fold cost-benefit for Genesis over a standard human scientist in a standard lab.\nGenesis is designed to automatically improve a more complicated scientific model than any previous system has attempted. The model that Genesis works with has thousands of interacting causal (mechanical) components related by tens of thousands of parameters. This contrasts sharply with all other closed-loop automated systems that we are aware of, which focus on simple input/output black-box optimisation.\nGenesis is specifically designed to automate systems biology research. Genesis will be designed to be able to initiate and execute in parallel one thousand hypothesis-led closed-loop cycles of experiment per-day. Each closed-loop cycle will consist of hypothesis formation, experiment planning, laboratory execution, and results interpretation."}, {"title": "2.1 Genesis Hardware", "content": "The hardware of Genesis will have at its heart a micro-fluidic system with one thousand computer-controlled u-bioreactors (developed in Vanderbilt University, USA) (Fig. 2). Achieving this will be a revolution in laboratory automation, as most biological labs have \u00a110 chemostats. The u-bioreactors will be arranged in groups of 48 using the standard footprint of a microtitre plate. Each u-bioreactors will be able to be configured in real time to run in batch, fed batch, or continuous mode. This flexibility will enable a very wide range of biological conditions to be explored, and experiments to be executed. In each u-bioreactors the Genesis-AI system will specify experiments of the form:\n\u2022 Genetics: (yeast strain - from a large library kept in an automated deepfreeze: ~20,000 strains deletants, reporters, etc.), growth-rate (when used as a chemostat), OD (when used as a turbidostat).\n\u2022 Environment: Growth medium (a cocktail of 10 metabolites and small-molecules added to a minimally defined medium from ~100), Drugs (a complex cocktail of compounds added to the growth media from ~10,000).\nThe observables from these experiments will be growth rate (batch), metabolic analysis of the growth medium (~10 compounds), metabolic analysis of the internal state of the yeast (~100 metabolites), and comprehensive gene expression levels (~6,000 genes). These observables are both automatable and highly informative."}, {"title": "2.2 Mass Spectrometry", "content": "In our proof of concept work on automating systems biology [11] we could only measure yeast population growth - using Optical Density (OD). This greatly limited how much could be learnt about systems biology. With Genesis we will measure (1) the internal state of ~100 metabolites in the yeast populations in the \u00b5-bioreactors, and (2) the internal state of ~6,000 tRNA types in the yeast populations in the \u00b5\u03bc-bioreactors (RNA-SEQ). This will enable far greater information constraints on the modelling."}, {"title": "2.3 Ontologies", "content": "In collaboration with IT company Thoughtworks, we have developed Genesis-DB, a database system designed to support the Genesis project, and Robot Scientists in gen- eral, by providing software agents access to large quantities of structured domain (RDF, Datalog) information [13]. We have also developed a new ontology for modelling data and meta-data from autonomously performed yeast \u00b5-bioreactors cultivations. The ontologies for experiments records such experimental conditions as temperature, growth medium, pH, sampling times, etc. The ontology for experimental results records Gene counts, mass"}, {"title": "2.4 Model Revision", "content": "In the Genesis project we will automate hundreds of thousands of system biology model revisions. This implies that these model revisions will need to be systematically recorded and available for inference. We have therefore developed RIMBO (Revisions for Improve- ments of Models in Biology Ontology), which describes the changes made to computa- tional biology models [14] (Fig. 5). RIMBO is intended as the foundation of a database"}, {"title": "2.5 Bioinformatics", "content": "To demonstrate the utility of our ontologies and databases we have used them as the foundation of two bioinformatic studies [15, 16]. Even though S. cerevisiae is a very well-studied organism, ~20% of its proteins remain largely unannotated. Many of these uncharacterized proteins are conserved between eukaryotes, including humans, providing a significant incentive to increase the pace of discovery.\nThe first bioinformatics investigation made use of untargeted metabolomics as a tool for functional discovery, generating profiles of ten regulatory deletant strains which are in- vestigated to better understand the consequences of their deletion, and their role in the metabolic reconfiguration of the diauxic shift [15]. Using previous semi-autonomously de- veloped gene regulatory models produced by Eve [11], a set of ten regulatory genes were selected due to both their particular relevance to the shift and implications of previously unknown connections in literature. These were then individually and collectively investi- gated using their untargeted metabolic profiles with the goal of clarifying regulatory roles and biological consequences of gene deletion. This also served as an assessment of the"}, {"title": "2.6 Learning Logical Models", "content": "The primary systems biology target for Genesis is the automated improvement of genome- scale metabolic models (GEMs) in S. cerevisiae. There are many different approaches to the systems biology modelling of metabolism, ranging from ordinary differential equa- tions (ODEs), flux-balance analysis (FBA) simulations, to graph topology models [11]. One approach we favour is to use first-order logic (FOL) [1]. The advantage of using FOL is that there are many available tools to infer new structure; which is much harder to do with say ODEs. We have developed LGEM+, a system for automated abductive improvement of GEMs consisting of: a compartmentalised FOL framework for describ- ing biochemical pathways (using curated GEMs as the expert knowledge source); and a two-stage hypothesis abduction procedure [17]."}, {"title": "3 Discussion", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Completing Genesis", "content": "The core structure of Genesis is complete, but much remains before the system is working at full capacity (Fig. 1). For the hardware: the \u00b5-bioreactor hardware needs to be scaled- up from 12 \u03bc-bioreactor units to 48 \u03bc-bioreactor units, and then 21 such units integrated; the MS system needs to fully integrated with the u-bioreactors; and we also need to integrate the planned (RNA-SEQ) transcriptomics experiments. For the software: we need more work on ontologies, databases, and knowledgebases; we need to develop the planned agent system (an agent for every known gene, protein, small molecule in yeast); we need to further develop the relational learning/inductive logic programming machine learning systems to enable the formation of more biologically relevant hypotheses about mode structure; we need to develop a robust control system to deal with the order of a thousand hypothesis-led experimental cycles per day; and finally we need to implement a Genesis virtual Research Agency to control overall resources to the agents."}, {"title": "3.2 Large Language Models", "content": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a step-change in AI. LLMs have achieved breakthrough performance on a wide range of tasks that require human intelligence. It is to be expected that LLMs will impact on the Genesis project in multiple ways, but it is not yet clear which will be the most important. One exciting potential use of LLMs in Genesis is in converting scientific knowledge currently encoded in natural language (e.g. in textbooks, papers), into explicit formal knowledge (e.g. in logic) that can be checked for correctness/truth and can be directly reasoned with. LLMs solve the predicate invention problem.\nAnother exciting use of LLMs is in hypothesis formation. The architecture of LLMs entails that the output string is the most likely one given the input string and the training data. For science these strings may be interpreted as scientific hypotheses. Due to their internal complexity and sophistication LLMs have the potential to go beyond existing text-based scientific hypothesis generation tools. The generation of hypotheses by LLMS is closely related to the phenomena of \"hallucinations\". These are LLM outputs that are not valid inferences from the training data. Some hallucinations may be simply factually wrong. For others, their validity is uncertain. Hallucinations are a serious problem in many applications. For example, in science it is not acceptable to hallucinate (make up) false references. However in scientific hypothesis generation hallucinations may be useful: probable novel hypotheses whose validity may be objectively tested by laboratory experiments."}]}

However, the recent advancements in language models have faced significant criticism for predominantly reflecting Western perspectives (Durmus et al., 2023) and displaying pronounced biases toward Anglocentric or American cultural norms (Johnson et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al., 2023). Such biases pose serious risks, including the stereotyping and alienation of users from underrepresented communities due to a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding (Cao et al., 2022). Addressing this issue begins with identifying and understanding the problem. This raises a critical question: to what extent do current LLMs align with the diverse cultural contexts worldwide, and how can this alignment be systematically evaluated? A significant body of research has utilized closed-style value questionnaires and surveys, such as the World Values Survey (WVS) (Haerpfer et al., 2024), Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions (Hofstede et al., 2010) or Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW)\u00b9. These surveys are part of globally recognized research initiatives aimed at investigating people's values and beliefs and they usually structure culture into various dimensions and employ closed-style multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for data collection. In the context of measuring cultural alignment in LLMs, NLP studies have leveraged these frameworks by probing LLMs with questions derived from the cultural dimensions outlined in these surveys (Cao et al., 2023a; Arora et al., 2023).

Specifically, we use GPT-40 to analyze these responses and determine the model's stance using the prompt shown in Figure 6. In many instances, LLMs respond to certain questions with statements like, \u201cAs an AI, I do not have any opinion on this proposition.\u201d Such responses can not be mapped to any survey option or Likert scale. We classify these responses as unclassifiable and label them as \"0\".\nTo validate this process, the first two authors manually reviewed a random sample of 100 forced open-ended and 100 fully unconstrained responses, extracting stances and comparing them to the model-generated stances for the corresponding questions.

The first is the Hard Alignment Metric, which measures plain accuracy by comparing model responses to survey answers for each culture. Formally, the hard metric H is defined as:\n$H = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 1\\{y_i = y_i'\\}$ \nHere, N is the total number of questions, $y_i$ represents the ground truth for the i-th question, and $y_i'$ is the model's response. The indicator function $1\\{y_i = y_i'\\}$ equals 1 if $y_i = y_i'$ and 0 otherwise.\nThe second metric is the Soft Alignment Metric, a relaxed version of the hard metric that assigns partial credit for ordinal-scale and categorical questions. The soft metric S is calculated as:\n$S = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{q_i - 1})$\nwhere\n$\\epsilon_i = \\begin{cases} \\frac{|y_i - y_i'|}{q_i - 1} & \\text{if the question is ordinal}, \\\\ 1 - reward & \\text{if the question is categorical}. \\end{cases}$\nHere, $q_i$ denotes the number of options for the i-th question (for ordinal questions). For categorical questions, the reward is proportional to the number of matching elements between the ground truth and the model response. This approach ensures a nuanced evaluation of model performance across different question types.\nHofstede Cultural Dimensions: Each of the six dimensions (D) in the Hofstede cultural survey is computed using the following formula:\n$D_i = \\lambda(Q_i^H - Q_i^H) + \\lambda(Q_i^L - Q_i^L) + C $", "1": "3.1 Models", "2": "3.2 Evaluation", "3": "3.3 Evaluation Metrics"}, {"title": "Results & Findings", "content": "Traditional closed-style classification often fails to capture the full extent of cultural alignment in LLMs under less constrained conditions.

Anthropological and social science perspectives emphasize the intricate nature of culture, which extends far beyond observable behaviors to encompass the lived experiences of individuals within a society (Geertz, 2017), which cannot be adequately captured through a closed-style multiple-choice question (MCQ) format. Such approach restricts language models by preventing them from expressing uncertainty or refusing to answer\u2014behaviors that can offer valuable insights into societal structures (Urman and Makhortykh, 2023), as discussed in Section 4.1 of our study. Instead, it risks creating an artificial sense of alignment through multiple-choice (MCQ) responses, a phenomenon well-documented in prior literature. A more comprehensive conceptualization of culture views it as an amalgamation of demographic and semantic proxies, each contributing to the complex tapestry of societal norms, values, and behaviors (Adilazuarda et al., 2024), with different evaluation frameworks tailored to assess specific proxies. In this regard, the studies by Naous et al. (2023); Rao et al. (2024) provide valuable examples by developing specialized frameworks to evaluate the adaptability of large language models (LLMs) across various cultural proxies, such as food, regional distinctions, and social values. Based on these insights, we recommend that future research should move beyond the exclusive reliance on closed-style evaluations and adopt more flexible, framework-based methodologies. This approach would allow for a more holistic and accurate assessment of language models' ability to understand and navigate the complexities of diverse cultural landscapes.\nThe assertion that language can serve as a reliable proxy for culture is a contentious and potentially flawed approach in academic research. While previous studies have used language as a representative indicator for cultural alignment and understanding (AlKhamissi et al., 2024; Masoud et al., 2023), this methodology oversimplifies the complex relationship between language and culture. The acquisition of a language associated with a particular culture is often a relatively straightforward process that can be accomplished within a relatively short timeframe. In contrast, the internalization and adoption of cultural values is a far more intricate and time-consuming process, often spanning gener-"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Closed-style surveys and questionnaires, while effective in collecting human responses, are inadequate to evaluate cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). Using WVS and Hofstede surveys as a case study, we demonstrate that LLM responses to survey questions exhibit severe instability across varying levels of constraint in the generation settings, as well as with simple changes such as the reordering of choices within the survey questions. We emphasize the need for more robust and flexible evaluation frameworks that focus on specific cultural proxies and highlight localized alignment claims rather than broad global assertions. We believe this study will inspire innovative methodologies for more nuanced and comprehensive evaluations of cultural alignment in LLMs."}, {"title": "Limitation", "content": "In our study, we specifically focus on the World Values Survey (WVS) and Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework as case studies to evaluate cultural alignment in large language models (LLMs). While other prominent surveys, such as the Pew Global Attitudes Survey (PEW) have also been utilized in similar contexts, we are unable to conduct experiments across all these datasets due to time and scope constraints. Nevertheless, as discussed in Appendix A, the majority of studies in the field rely predominantly on WVS and Hofstede's surveys. Many other surveys share a similar multiple-choice format, so the challenges we identify in using WVS and Hofstede's frameworks are broadly applicable to this general approach to cultural evaluation.\nFor this work, we focus on three representative cultures from three distinct regions, based on the Inglehart-Welzel Cultural Map. These cultures allow us to derive meaningful and contrasting results regarding the cultural alignment of LLMs. We believe that if we could expand the scope to include a wider variety of cultures from additional regions would yield even deeper and more comprehensive insights. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 4.2, we also hint at the significant issue of low-resource languages in cultural alignment evaluations. The nuances of low-resource languages and their representation in cultural alignment tests have the potential to uncover critical insights and address overlooked gaps in this field. Due to resource constraints, we were unable to explore this dimension further in our current study.\nThere are virtually limitless variations of probing methods that can be designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) under varying levels of constraints. In our study, we focus on designing and testing three specific probing methods: forced reverse order, forced open-ended, and fully unconstrained, in addition to the traditional multiple-choice format. These methods are chosen to explore different dimensions of LLM behavior and their ability to align with cultural and contextual nuances. However, we acknowledge that this selection represents only a small subset of the possible probing strategies, leaving significant room for further exploration. Additionally, we evaluate our claims using five state-of-the-art LLMs. While these models were carefully chosen to represent the current advancements in the field, the sheer number of available models presents countless alternative choices. This introduces another limitation in our study, as the results may vary depending on the specific models selected."}, {"title": "Background Study", "content": "To identify studies that utilize the World Values Survey or Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework in evaluating large language models (LLMs), we conduct a systematic search across Google Scholar, arXiv, and the ACL Anthology.

Many studies evaluating large language models (LLMs) have adopted a similar methodology by utilizing multiple-choice questions derived from Hofstede's Value Survey Module (VSM). (Kharchenko et al., 2024) investigates the cultural sensitivity of LLMs using Hofstede's cultural dimensions, analyzing responses to advice-based prompts across 36 countries and multiple languages to assess whether LLMs align with national cultural values. Similarly, Masoud et al. (2023) evaluates LLMs' alignment with Hofstede's cultural dimensions using the VSM13 questionnaire, a structured survey with Likert-scale multiple-choice questions. The study finds that GPT-4 demonstrates stronger and more consistent cultural alignment than GPT-3.5 and Llama 2, particularly when adapted to specific personas. Interestingly, despite being primarily trained on English data, GPT-4 aligns more closely with Chinese cultural values while struggling with American and Arab cultural contexts.\nCao et al. (2023b) uses the Hofstede Cultural Survey to assess ChatGPT's cultural alignment. ChatGPT struggles to adjust to foreign cultural situations and most closely conforms to American culture, according to the study. English-language prompts also lessen answer variance, flattening cultural differences and skewing results in favor of American standards. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) capture cross-cultural differences in values, but their outputs only weakly align with Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the World Values Survey (WVS) (Arora et al., 2023). To evaluate this alignment, the study reformulates survey questions into closed-style (fill-in-the-blank) prompts, enabling models to generate responses comparable to human survey data.

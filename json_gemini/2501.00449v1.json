Today, mature and verified marker systems for assessing personality traits already exist.\nHowever, marker systems-based assessing methods have their own limitations. For example,\ndishonest responses cannot be avoided. In this research, the goal is to develop a method that can\novercome the limitations. The proposed method will rely on physiological signals for the assessment.\nThirty participants have participated in this experiment. Based on the statistical results, we found that\nthere are correlations between students' personality traits and their physiological signal change when\nlearning via videos. Specifically, we found that participants' degree of extraversion, agreeableness,\nconscientiousness, and openness to experiences are correlated with the variance of heart rates, the\nvariance of GSR values, and the skewness of voice frequencies, etc.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Motivation and Background", "content": ""}, {"title": "1.1 The Background of Using Personality Traits to Help Students", "content": "Why do we need a method to assess students' personality traits? Existing literature has\nhighlighted the relationship between personality traits and learning style or performance. For example,\nthe research of Komarraju et al. pointed out that the Big Five (a popular model for the assessment of\npersonality traits) together explained 14% of the variance in GPA while learning styles explained an\nadditional 3% (Komarraju et al., 2011). Knowing students' personality traits in advance may help\nteachers assist students when they run into trouble in learning. Furthermore, utilizing personality traits\nas information can make it easier to adapt to students' preferred learning styles and may achieve better\nlearning performance in turn. Among all learning mechanisms, we would like to limit the scope of\nthis research to video-based learning. The spread of Covid-19, which is perhaps the most influential\nevent in recent years, makes most college students in Taiwan experience video-based learning since\nmid-2021. In such a scenario, it is more difficult for lecturers to interact with students and hence\nfiguring out a more efficient way to understand students becomes a more urgent need.\nLearning via videos is not a completely new concept. Furthermore, since students learning via\nvideos can learn at their own pace to some degree, it brings chances to researchers to understand"}, {"title": "1.2 Limitations of Existing Methods", "content": "Certainly, there were already mechanisms developed for personality traits assessment. A\nmarker system which is a transparent format to quantify one's personality traits in terms of the degree\nof Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional stability, and Imagination was\ndeveloped by Goldberg in 1992 (Goldberg, 1992). However, using questionnaires does have some\ndrawbacks. Perhaps, dishonest responding is one of the most severe problems (Zettler et al., 2015).\nBesides, filling and interpreting questionnaire results takes additional time. These issues limit the\nusage of existing methods."}, {"title": "1.3 The Contribution and Summarization of the Proposed Method", "content": "In this research, the goal is to develop a method to assess personality traits without\nquestionnaires and marker systems. The design has several advantages:\n1. it uses only physiological signals and thus does not have strong dependency on e-learning\nsystems\n2. there is no need to spend time filling questionnaires and doing analysis\n3. there is a chance that physiological signals can reflect psychological status of human beings in a\nreal-time manner\n4. knowing students' personality traits helps to adapt to their needs as well as adjusting teaching\npedagogies\n5. the chance of dishonest responding is reduced\nIn addition to the statistical results, we also developed a device prototype, a software for collecting the\nphysiological signals, and a mathematics model to present the correlation between physiological\nsignals and personality traits.

The Big Five factors has been adopted in many researches. The research\nof Barrick and Mount found that the Big Five dimensions are highly related with one\u2019s job\nperformance (Barrick & Mount, 1991). Rothmann and Coetzer also pointed out that that Emotional\nStability, Extraversion, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness were related to task\nperformance and creativity (Rothmann & Coetzer, 2003). Butt, Khalid, and Satti conducted a survey\nin the healthcare sector of Pakistan and found that the personality traits Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness to experience (Imagination) had positive impact on organizational\neffectiveness while Neuroticism had negative impact. O\u2019Connor and Paunonen found that one\u2019s level\nof Conscientiousness is strongly related with academic success; while Openness to Experience was\nsometimes positively associated with scholastic achievement, whereas Extraversion was sometimes\nnegatively related to the same criterion (O\u2019Connor & Paunonen, 2007)."}, {"title": "2.2 Physiological Signal and Psychological Status", "content": "Existing research results showed that physiological signals can be used as indicators for some\npsychological status. The research of Villarejo, Zapirain, and Zorrilla built a stress sensor based on\nGalvanic Skin Response (GSR) (Villarejo, Zapirain, & Zorrilla, 2012). Lykken used GSR to build a\nlie detector (Lykken, 1959). The research reported a very high correction rate. Hamadicharef proposed\na method to measure one\u2019s attention level from her/his electroencephalogram recordings\n(Hamadicharef et al., 2009). The research reported a classification accuracy rate of 89.4%. The\nresearch of Guo et al. used principal component analysis and SVM to classify emotion states based on\nheart rate variability and reached the accuracy of 71.4% (Guo et al., 2016). The research of\nSriramprakash, Prasanna, and Murthy successfully developed a model to assess individual\u2019s degree of\nstress with electrocardiogram and GSR (Sriramprakash, Prasanna, & Murthy, 2017). Egger, Ley, and\nHanke conducted a survey and found that physiological signals achieved 79.3% accuracy to assess\nindividuals\u2019 emotion state and speech recognition achieved 80.46% for happiness and sadness\nspecifically (Egger, Ley, & Hanke, 2019). Khan et al. proposed a novel deep neural network (DNN)\narchitecture based on the fusion of raw heartbeat and breathing data for classifying and visualizing\nvarious emotion states and achieved 71.67% accuracy (Khan et al., 2021). Bastos developed several\nmodels for assessing personality traits via physiological signals. The signals used in the research were\npupil, ECG, BVP (Blood Volume Pulse), and EDA (GSR) and there were totally 473 features\nextracted from the signals (Bastos, 2019).\nBased on the survey of existing literature, it appears that the connection between\nphysiological signals and psychological status has been established.

K\u00f6seoglu reported very\nsimilar results, but the ratio grew to 17% and 5% respectively (K\u00f6seoglu, 2016). Both researches\nshowed that personality traits do explain one's academic achievements to a certain degree.\nFurthermore, Duff et al. found that people with a higher degree of extraversion and imagination tend\nto use the deep learning approach; people with a higher degree of neuroticism and agreeableness tend\nto use the surface learning approach; people with a higher degree of extraversion and\nconscientiousness and a lower degree of neuroticism tend to use the strategic learning approach (Duff\net al., 2004). Although using a different personality model, the research results of Moreira et al.\nshowed almost identical results. They found that students with a steady temperament or high character\ncoherence tend to use the deep learning approach (Moreira et al., 2021).

Our user study with 14 game designers shows high levels of both satisfaction with the generated game plots and sense of ownership over the narratives, but also reconfirms that LLM are limited in their ability to generate complex and truly innovative content. We also show that diverse user populations have different expectations from AI assistants, and encourage researchers to study how tailoring assistants to diverse user groups could potentially lead to increased job satisfaction and greater creativity and innovation over time.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The landscape of interactive entertainment and the escalating player expectations has led to increased demand for innovative tools to support the work of game designers. In particular, the process of crafting compelling narratives within games can be labor intensive, and maintaining coherence and engagement throughout the game can be challenging (Montfort, 2004).\nLarge language models (LLMs; Radford et al., 2019) hold promise as a support tool to augment and enhance the manual process of game design. Previous work used LLMs to generate dialogues between players and non-player characters (NPCs; Volum et al., 2022), to facilitate player-driven creation of new elements in the game world (Huang and Sun, 2023), and to help players uncover new narrative paths in a text-based games (Peng et al., 2024), among others (Sweetser, 2024)."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "LLMs in Gaming. Language models have commonly been used to generate dialogues with NPCs (e.g., van Stegeren and My\u015bliwiec, 2021; Gao and Emami, 2023; Alavi et al., 2024). Kumaran et al. (2023) generated branching conversation paths with NPCs based on player choices, while Akoury et al. (2023) used LLMs to erate contextually-grounded NPCs dialogues in video games. In a similar line of work, LLMs have been used to power agents (NPCs and players) in games (Hausknecht et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023).\nIn terms of narrative generation, LLMs were used for generating quests (V\u00e4rtinen et al., 2024) as well as interactive stories (Freiknecht and Effelsberg, 2020). Ashby et al. (2023) used knowledge graphs and LLMs to generate personalized quests based on player-NPC dialogues and actions. Similarly, Colado et al. (2023) used LLMs to streamline the creation of serious games, automating the generation of adaptive learning content within narrative structures. In comparison to prior work, GamePlot goes beyond content generation with LLMs and facilitates a collaborative AI-designer process designers to iterate and refine the generated content.\nGENEVA (Leandro et al., 2024) is another collaborative tool similar to GamePlot. It uses LLMS to generate branching narratives based on a high-level description from the designer, and visualize complex story paths through interactive graphs. In comparison, GamePlot enables designers to design game narratives through gameplay collaboratively with LLMs and refine them at any stage of the design process.\nLLMs for Creative Writing. Various LLM-powered tools have been developed to assist creative writers (e.g., Yuan et al., 2022; Mirowski et al., 2023; Chakrabarty et al., 2024). Wordcraft (Yuan et al., 2022) allows writers to have open-ended conversations with an LLM about their stories and enables custom requests, such as rewriting sections and generating new story elements. Similarly, Dramatron (Mirowski et al., 2023) provides a co-writing environment for screenplays and theater"}, {"title": "3 GamePlot", "content": "GamePlot\u00b9 is an AI assistant tailored for the early stages of game development, with a specific focus on story creation. GamePlot comprises two rooms: the design room (Sec 3.1) and the game room (Sec 3.2). Upon arriving at the landing page, designers can choose to enter the design room, where they develop the game story. Upon completion, the tool generates a game plot, the summary of key events and characters, which will be used as the starting point for future game sessions. Both players and designers can enter the game room where they can play the game, provide feedback (players) and refine the plot based on player feedback (designers). We detail both rooms below, and conclude with the implementation details (Sec 3.3)."}, {"title": "3.1 Design Room", "content": "The design room (Fig. 1) offers the following features to aid game designers.\nGame Story Development. The design room provides a text window for designers to develop their storylines by playing the game. The designer's initial inputs may include: (a) an opening story, which will be used by the designer to create the game and will initialize the game session for players (see Appendix A.1); (b) instructions to the LLM, such as \u201cContinue this game [...] You can introduce new characters [...]\" (see full example in Appendix A.2); and (c) 1-2 game and player turns, which serve as in-context examples for the LLM.\nAfter the initial inputs, the designer proceeded to design the game through game play. They can choose whether to write the current turn or use the LLM to generate it. If the designer wrote a game turn, the LLM responds with a player turn, and vice versa. Table 1 demonstrates the initial turns in a game design. As can be seen, game turns can involve introducing NPCs along with their backstory, mood, persona, and more (see appendices A.3 for the tag inventory). The window is fully editable, allowing designers to modify both previous and current turns.\nPlot. Once designers have fleshed out the storyline by playing through the game in the main window, they can click a button to summarize the"}, {"title": "3.2 Game Room", "content": "Once a game room is created, designers can share the room with players for collaborative gameplay, where the LLM generates the game turns, and players engage with the game through player turns. Figure 2 presents the game room interface. On the left, the game window is shown, where the game is played (by designers or players). The middle parts and the right part of the figure demonstrate the different actions that players and designers can perform in the room, as detailed below.\nGame Window. The game window displays the game and player turns. It is initialized with the plot (Sec 3.1), which guides the LLMs in playing the game turns. Players can play their turns and provide feedback on the game turns. Designers can participate in the game themselves or monitor the narrative as the players see it.\nDesigner Control. In the game room, designers have additional controls to monitor and intervene in the game flow if necessary (Fig. 2, right). First, as the story unfolds and players interact with the game, designers may wish to modify the plot. Designers can make live changes to key events that haven't been played yet through the game interface.\nSecond, on the same pane, the designer sees a list of NPCs that have appeared in the narrative and their corresponding hidden tags (e.g., [Mood], [Thought], etc.). The same information is not visible to players.\nFinally, designers can assume control of an NPC. Technically, this is implemented by identifying game turns that refer to the controlled NPC and allowing designers to edit and approve them. The players are unaware that the game turns are controlled by the designer. This Wizard of Oz-style experimentation allows designers to adjust NPC responses, guide players out of narrative dead ends, or modify the game flow without breaking the player's immersion."}, {"title": "3.3 Implementation Details", "content": "We used GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k as the backbone LLM for GamePlot due to its cost-efficiency, low response time, and good performance.

Participants were first given a brief tutorial on GamePlot and its key features. Following the tutorial, they were provided with a template story, including the premise of the game, instructions, and the first few turns (see Appendix A.4). Participants were asked to use the template story to design a game in the design room, for which they were given 20-25 minutes. Once they were done, the resulting game plot was used to initialize a game room, to which they logged into as designers. Along with the designer, one of the authors of this paper joined the game room as a player to collaboratively test the game with them. Participants were given 15-20 minutes to test the game.\nWe detail below the recruitment process (Sec 4.1). At the end of the testing sessions, participants had to fill out a post-study questionnaire about their experience. Questions were design to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the GamePlot (Sec 4.2), as well as to more broadly query them about how open they were to the idea of designing game stories collaboratively with AI (Sec 4.3)."}, {"title": "4.1 Participants", "content": "We recruited 14 participants through Upwork and social media advertisements. The majority of the participants (64.3%) had at least one year of professional experience in the gaming industry (Fig. 3). Of the 14 participants, 8 indicated that they had expertise in narrative writing. This diverse group ensured a comprehensive evaluation of GamePlot from the perspectives of both narrative writers and game designers. Each session lasted between 1 to 2 hours, and participants were compensated at a rate of $25 per hour."}, {"title": "4.2 Feedback on GamePlot Features", "content": "Valuable Features. We asked the participants about the features they found most valuable in the game room. In particular, we asked them whether they liked the following features: the ability to change the plot during the test session, the NPC summary, the collaborative game play, and the feedback buttons. We also asked them which 1-3 features in GamePlot they found most valuable and would like to see retained, allowing them to provide free-text answers. Table 3 presents the results. The top part shows the number of participants that favored each of the specific features we asked about, while the bottom part shows the number of participants that mentioned each other feature in their free-text responses. For each feature, we also present an example feedback from the participants.\nWe observe that the most liked feature was the ability to change the game plot during the test session, which was favored by 12 out of 14 participants. Half of the participants also favored the NPC hidden states dropdown (NPC summary) and the multiplayer setup. When specifically asked about how useful the game room was overall, participants rated its usefulness for testing with players highly, with 13 out of 14 giving ratings of 4 or 5, resulting in an average score of 4.21.\nIn the free-text responses, several features of GamePlot stood out. Participants appreciated the ability to generate content (for example, generating multiple plots for the same story), as well as the level of control they retained and the ability to modify the generated content. Several participants mentioned that they liked the ability to go back and edit the game and have the tool propagate the changes to later turns. A key theme that emerged was GamePlot's adaptability and control in story generation in the design room.

Participants described the gen-"}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "Our findings reveal that game designers, especially those with less narrative experience, may find generative AI most valuable for its ability to scale and accelerate the narrative design process. Developers may prioritize efficiency, aiming to integrate narrative elements into gameplay seamlessly. For them, GamePlot's ability to generate quick, plausible plotlines and handle NPC interactions could significantly reduce the bottleneck of storytelling, allowing them to focus on other game mechanics.\nFor narrative writers, LLMs play a different, but equally important role. Writers generally want to maintain creative control over story elements but appreciate the AI's assistance in creating variations and exploring new narrative possibilities.\nOur findings are in line with Biermann et al. (2022), who found that writers valued maintaining their own voice and autonomy when collaborating with AI tools.\nThe designers in our study also emphasized the tool's flexibility in maintaining creative control. Most reported a strong sense of ownership over the generated plot, largely due to GamePlot's ability to allow on-the-fly adjustments to NPC behaviors, environments, and plot elements. This creates a collaborative loop between the designer's input and the AI's suggestions, where both contribute to shaping the story in real-time.\nHowever, a key challenge is ensuring that the AI's contributions are nuanced enough to engage experienced writers, while still automating the more routine tasks. LLMs currently excel at offering simple plot branches and character interactions, however, they struggle with maintaining narrative tension and generating complex conflicts, which are essential in many storytelling genres. Along work on improving LLMs' narrative generation abilities, future research could also study how to tailor AI assistants to diverse user populations based on their experience and preferences.\nWhile the iterative process of refining story elements may not always lead to a better narrative from the writer's perspective, and the final product may not surpass a human-written story in terms of emotional depth or complexity, the collaborative process itself could be more engaging for the designers. Enabling real-time testing and adjustments makes the creation process more interactive and enjoyable, preventing it from becoming a mundane task.\nThe user engagement with the creative process leads to another dimension of value from human-AI collaboration that is often overlooked: enhancing job satisfaction (Noy and Zhang, 2023).\nWriters and developers alike may find that integrating AI as a narrative assistant makes the design process feel less like a solitary writing job and more like a collaborative and iterative experience, similar to the game play itself. This opens up new avenues for research on whether enhancing the engagement of the design process can also improve the overall quality of game narratives. Although the final product may not always reflect a higher level of narrative complexity, the enjoyment of the process may lead to greater creativity and innovation over time.\nMoreover, as narrative tools become more sophisticated, balancing AI-generated content with human creativity will be critical. We believe that LLMs should not replace writers but instead empower them by providing building blocks they can refine. One promising avenue is to explore how AI might suggest alternative paths or prompt writers with creative challenges, making the design process even more interactive and engaging.\nLimitations\nScope. Our user study focused exclusively on GPT-3.5. We hypothesize that the results would largely extend to other LLMs; however, this has not been empirically tested. Additionally, the relatively small sample size of 14 game narrative designers may not fully capture the diverse expectations of designers with varying backgrounds and focus areas. Our findings suggest that designers with different levels of narrative expertise prioritize distinct aspects of AI assistance. Therefore, future research should aim to scale up the study to investigate a broader spectrum of designers and explore these differences in greater detail.\nAI Acceptance Level. It is worth noting that our study suffers from an inherent (and inevitable) sampling bias: It is very likely that the participants were already inclined to embrace the use of AI in game narrative design.

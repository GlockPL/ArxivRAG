Machine learning (ML) apparition, along with deep learning (DL) emergence, extended many approaches against diseases apparition and their spread. And despite their outstanding results in predicting infectious diseases, conflicts appeared regarding the types of data used and how they can be studied, analyzed, and exploited using various emerging methods. This has led to some ongoing discussions in the field. This research aims not only to provide an overview of what has been accomplished, but also to highlight the difficulties related to the types of data used, and the learning methods applied for each research objective. It categorizes these contributions into three areas: predictions using Public Health Data to prevent the spread of a transmissible disease within a region; predictions using Patients' Medical Data to detect whether a person is infected by a transmissible disease; and predictions using both Public and patient medical data to estimate the extent of disease spread in a population. The paper also critically assesses the potential of AI and outlines its limitations in infectious disease management.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "For many years, the world has experienced several tragic events, with the emergence of diseases being among the most devastating upheavals. Considered as life companions for several decades, they have caused an increasingly dangerous imbalance in life. Defined as \"a particular abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism \" [1], they are generally associated with emerging signs and symptoms. Regarding causes, external factors like pathogens and internal malfunctions can be the origin of different diseases, distributed into various types. These include airborne diseases, foodborne diseases, lifestyle diseases, non-communicable diseases, and infectious diseases. Infectious diseases, also called communicable diseases, are among the most dangerous illnesses that haven't stopped manifesting and developing. They can spread from person to person or from animal to person [2]. Infectious diseases are classified into endemic diseases, epidemic diseases, and pandemic diseases. Endemic diseases, the first category, are identified diseases in a given region but do not spread. The second, epidemic diseases, is characterized by its rapid and brutal spread within a given region. The third, pandemic diseases, are communicable diseases that spread across continents or even the entire world, leading to the contamination of an unimaginable number of people. The classification of diseases is still unsatisfying; it has become not enough to just identify them, but also crucial to neutralize and prevent their spread in real time. Consequently, several studies have made the prediction and prevention of infectious diseases their main objective. Computers have significantly contributed to scientific advancement, especially with the vision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on technological growth. The field of Machine Learning (ML) has significantly impacted research and opened the door to what was once considered impossible. Machines equipped with intelligence have now become essential tools in the world of science. Many ML models have therefore been designed to predict infectious diseases and forecast them. Various detection and prediction models have been developed due to the diverse learning approaches available. Depending on whether supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised learning (SSL) is employed, or"}, {"title": "2 Research methodology", "content": "Before taking a vision into the concepts discussed in the literature, three crucial questions caught attention :\n\u2022 What are the various types of data that have been applied and studied?\n\u2022 Which kind of learning is being used?\n\u2022 How are the learning models selected based on the data?\nTo address these issues, a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the completed work were conducted. For this, an extensive literature review was performed, focusing on relevant articles published since April 2022. This search was carried out using various academic search engines, such as: Google Scholar, ResearchGate, SNDL academic and Scopus, To obtain diverse and comprehensive electronic documentation on scientific research from various publishers. A combination of specific set of targeted keywords are also used, to enhance the precision of the search. In the electronic search phase, no restrictions were applied initially. Collecting early discoveries and foundational works on infectious diseases using ML is crucial for understanding the origins of predictions and the evolution of research. The second search was limited to articles published within the last ten years, using various keyword combinations. The key research areas and important topics studied are: infectious diseases, AI, ML and predictions. These articles were initially selected based on an assessment of their titles. Contributions were then further evaluated in the manual review phase after reading the abstracts. The criteria for selecting the articles and the resulting articles are illustrated in Figure 1. Section 3 lists the contributions from the selected papers. The responses to the identified issues and the discussed limitations are covered in Section 4."}, {"title": "3 Background", "content": "Human health is influenced by various life phenomena, and it depends not only on the individual themselves, but also on their surrounding environment. Consequently, individuals are called to address and adapt to these influences. Their ability to drive positive change through the development of innovative strategies and technologies offers hope in addressing various health crises. The appearance of the first pandemics that marked history, along with their impact on daily life and environmental changes, have pushed AI researchers around the world to develop various prediction and prevention systems. Three major categories of prediction research can be identified based on the research objectives and the data used: The first category focuses on detecting and predicting the spread of infectious diseases in specific locations. The second category aims to determine whether an individual may be infected by a communicable disease. While the third category combines the two first categories, addressing both the prediction of communicable diseases in patients and their spread within a population. The diverse methods and databases utilized in the detection of infectious diseases, as presented in this study, are illustrated in Figure 2.\nDespite the distinctions that will be highlighted in the following sections between the three categories, all of them rely on the use of different AI techniques and share a common goal: preventing and controlling the spread of a disease."}, {"title": "3.1 Prediction Based on Public Health Data", "content": "Initial studies for preventing infectious diseases spread employed event-based and indicator-based surveillance methods [3]. However, their limitations in providing real-time predictions have directed research to the adoption of new technologies. Predictions based on Public Health Data enable a diverse range of technological applications."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Numerical Data : Time-series Epidemiological and locational Data", "content": "In predicting contagious diseases, research databases are often presented in numerical formats. These data types frequently include location-related and epidemiological information. The most available data comprises information about the number of deaths, number of contaminated and number of recovered in regions. Epidemiological data includes data on population exposure levels, which are essential for risk assessment. The most used algorithms for this type of data are Naive Bayes (NB), Clustering Algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory Based Models and Transformer Based Models.\nNaive Bayes algorithms. Na\u00efve Bayes is a simple yet robust algorithm for predicting outcomes. In machine learning, the goal is often to select the best hypothesis based on the given data. Na\u00efve Bayes applies Bayes\u2019 Theorem, which offers a method for calculating the probability of a hypothesis using prior knowledge [4]. Tiwari et al. [4] involved the use of NB along with SVM, and Linear Regression (LR), to predict the trend of Covid-19 pandemic over the world while minimizing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Table 1). The algorithms were applied to a real-time series dataset containing the global record of confirmed, recovered, deaths, and active cases of Covid-19 outbreak. Before the implementation phase, dataset preprocessing is also done for getting the effective results. During the fourth stage (Data collection, Data preprocessing, model training and model evaluation), the data is split into two subsets: the training set and the testing set, where 42 % portion of the data is selected for testing predictions. The NB algorithm proved its effectiveness compared to other tested techniques with an MAE of 488806.7492 and MSE of 400919367451.7439.\nDespite its advantages, NB only works well with distinct and informative features [5]. Because it treats all features equally and presumes they are conditionally independent, its performance may suffer if there are noisy or irrelevant features [5].\nClustering Algorithms. Ravi et al. [6] proposed a novel ML approach to track COVID-19 contact details that utilizes the DBSCAN algorithm, recognized as one of the most effective clustering algorithms. This approach incorporates time-series location data and prediction techniques to enhance tracking accuracy. The authors have proposed an innovative approach to prevent the spread of new infections in densely populated areas. DBSCAN is used as a clustering algorithm to locate infected individuals and their close contacts, in order to stop the transmission of the virus (Table 1). In the study of Gupta et al. [7], Two different clustering techniques, density-based clustering and partitioning-based clustering, were used to analyze COVID-19 infection cases. A comparative analysis was conducted between the DBSCAN and K-means algorithms, with DBSCAN showing better performance for clustering tasks. Although using time series locational data can provide valuable information about the movement patterns and interactions of individuals over time, DBSCAN has some disadvantages."}, {"title": "Long short-term memory based models.", "content": "Since LSTM based models are specialized in the exploration of times series data, they have the potential applications in the field of public health for forecasting epidemic cases, deaths, and recoveries. Some authors like Masum et al. [9] have produced a sustainable prognostic method of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh using the DL models. The article presents a forecast on the counting number of infectious cases in Bangladesh from May 15th, 2020 until June 15th, 2020 (30 days). The LSTM network is used to predict the upcoming per day confirmed, death, and recovered cases in Bangladesh on patient data taken from the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) healthcare (Table 2). The authors have also made a comparative analysis by the RMSE rate among the LSTM, Random Forest (RF) regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. Where LSTM proved higher performances on time series analysis. Zhou et al. [10] have also presented a novel approach to forecasting COVID-19 using DL models. The proposed LSTM-based DL model is considered among the most advanced models to forecast time series data. They can take nonlinear factors into account and have the potential to provide more accurate predictions of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries. The proposed methodology in the paper involves constructing a prediction model of emergency material demand based on the infectious disease model. The model uses a time-varying demand and LSTM sequential decision model to provide a scientific and effective prediction method for actual emergency rescue work (Table 2: MAE and MSE for death cases in United States). The approach combines traditional infectious disease prediction methods and DL prediction techniques. The proposed model also includes different countries' migration data, which helps to retrieve other characteristics related to the epidemic and accurately build the model. Rakhshan et al. [11] for their part, have presented a combined approach for modeling and forecasting COVID-19, which can aid in determining interventions and predicting future growth patterns. The used dataset is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and includes daily COVID-19 reports and global geographical"}, {"title": "Transformer Based Models.", "content": "Transformers are neural network models that replace the commonly used recurrent layers in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-head self-attention. By relying entirely on attention mechanisms, transformers effectively capture global dependencies in data sequences and allow for much greater parallelization [13]. Ming et al. [14] developed a computational tool, HostNet, to predict virus hosts using deep neural networks. HostNet integrates Transformer, CNN, and BiGRU models, and was tested on a benchmark dataset of 'Rabies lyssavirus' and an in-house 'Flavivirus' dataset. It outperforms existing methods in accuracy and F1 score, thanks to its enhanced representation modules. Transformers are highly effective for time series forecasting tasks. Another Transformer-based model was also developed by Li et al. [15] to predict the long-term spread of seasonal influenza. It includes a source selection module to merge data from various sources and capture spatial dependencies. The model was tested on datasets from the United States and Japan, which included weekly influenza statistics from different regions. Demonstrating superior long-term forecasting performance compared to traditional autoregressive and RNN-based models, achieving an RMSE of 0.52 for short-term predictions and 0.87 for long-term predictions on the Japan dataset. For the US-HSS dataset, the model achieved an RMSE of 0.54 for short-term predictions and 0.89 for long-term predictions (Table 3). Due to the limitations of traditional epidemiological and ML models in forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic such as challenges with generalization, scalability, and the lack of sufficient surveillance data, Wang et al. [16] have proposed a novel approach that combines epidemiological theories with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Their model, T-SIRGAN, integrates the Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model to generate epidemiological simulation data, while GANs are employed for data augmentation. Transformers are then used to predict future trends. The study utilized COVID-19 data, including cumulative confirmed cases and deaths,"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Using time series data to predict infectious diseases involves analyzing the epidemiological growth and contact tracing of the illness (Tables 4, 5). Locational data, for example, can help in identifying potential contacts and understanding the spread of the virus within a specific area. By analyzing their temporal aspect, it may be possible to track the movements of infected individuals and identify individuals who may have come into proximity with them. This can aid in effective contact tracing and containment strategies. However, due to limited accurate data on COVID-19 records and locations, as well as inherent uncertainties, traditional methods have struggled to accurately predict the global impact of the pandemic [4]. Recent ML models have shown improved efficiency in forecasting infectious diseases. Na\u00efve Bayes proved its effectiveness in handling uncertainty by estimating the probabilities of outcomes, making it useful for both predictive and diagnostic tasks [19]. Clustering-based machine learning techniques can also automate contact tracing, resulting in more accurate and efficient outcomes [7]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have gained significant attention in the field of deep learning for their ability to model nonlinear relationships. However, traditional RNNs face vanishing gradient issues and failed with capturing long-term dependencies [20]. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and their variants have been applied to sequence modeling, addressing these challenges and achieving success in various applications [21]. Transformer models have further demonstrated superior performance in capturing long-range dependencies compared to RNNs [13],"}, {"title": "3.1.2 Textual Data: Social and News Data", "content": "Textual data is becoming increasingly important among the various types of data used to predict transmissible diseases, as it enhances monitoring and prevention efforts.

[24] employed articles and reports to predict infectious diseases that did not occur for six months in various countries, testing models based on SVM, SSL, and DNN. The number of articles related to each disease was calculated, and diseases were then labeled for each country based on whether they have appeared or not. Known as an ML technique that combines labeled and unlabeled data, SSL based models showed outstanding performance compared with SVM and DNN (Table 6). Because SSL makes good use of both labeled and unlabeled data, it has attracted a lot of interest. This is particularly crucial in practical applications when very little data is labeled [25]. However, a lot of unimportant or noisy elements in real-world raw data are frequently missed by SSL approaches. To enhance semi-supervised classification performance, it is crucial to choose pertinent neighbors and characteristics for every sample [25]. And despite the quality of the study conducted in [24], the experience in their proposed work was conducted during two distinct periods, which can lead to a contradiction due to the existence of seasonal diseases."}, {"title": "Support vector machine models.", "content": "Since the SVM based models can handle high-dimensional problems with limited training data [26], Kim et al. [27] developed a prediction model using SVM based on an analysis of articles related to influenza pandemics and infectious diseases. The authors extracted several keywords that were closely related to influenza and used word2vec to determine which keywords were related to the keyword 'influenza'. Then, SVM was applied to the extracted data to predict if the number of influenza patients would increase or decrease at a specific week. The prediction results using news text data with SVM achieved a mean accuracy of 86.7% in forecasting whether the weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) patient ratio would increase or decrease, and an RMSE of 0.611% in estimating the weekly ILI patient ratio (Table 6). Thapen et al. [28] used novel data-analytics to detect and forecast epidemics while developing DEFENDER system: Detecting and Forecasting Epidemics Using Novel Data-Analytics for Enhanced Response. The system ensures three services: early warning detection, situational awareness and nowcasting of epidemics. The number of tweets matching each symptom captured on the online database Freebase, was tracked daily for each geographical area monitored. To distinguish between health-related and non-health-related tweets and articles, two classifiers were used: SVM and NB (Table 6). The areas of high tweet activity were located in a country or region using the DBSCAN algorithm. The number of cases from the current data is predicted by adjusting the observed symptom levels to the previously available clinical data containing week, disease, location and count. Although SVM outperforms many other systems, it has limitations with complex data due to the high computational cost of solving quadratic programming problems [29]. Its performance also heavily depends on the choice of kernel functions and their parameters [29]."}, {"title": "Deep neural network based models.", "content": "Since the study of Thapen et al. [28] considered only a limited number of symptoms, Serban et al. [30] proposed an improvement called SENTINEL of the previous system (DEFENDER), that aims to explore a boarder range of symptoms and diseases. DNN based models (CNN, LSTM) were then selected to differentiate between health-related and non-health-related tweets (Table 6). In both studies [28] and [30], the social media twitter was analyzed. Given the strong correlation between infectious diseases and Twitter data [31], Chae et al. [32] presents a novel approach for predicting infectious diseases using deep learning models, specifically DNN and LSTM, combined with big data sources like Twitter mentions along with Naver search queries and weather data. The study addresses limitations of traditional models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), by incorporating real-time data to predict the spread of diseases such as chickenpox, scarlet fever, and malaria. The DL models significantly outperformed traditional methods, with DNN improving prediction performance by 24% and LSTM by 19% for chickenpox. The main evaluation metric, RMSE, showed that these models better captured trends. The mean RMSE of the top 10 DNN models for chickenpox was 72.8215, while the top 10 LSTM models had a mean RMSE of 78.2850, particularly during rapid disease spread. Demonstrating their potential to enhance infectious disease forecasting systems. Despite Twitter's reputation for being used by credible individuals sharing accurate information, it is not widely used by numerous people. Consequently, the conclusions obtained are then restricted. Drinkall et al. [33], for their part, have introduced a novel approach that incorporates transformer-based language models into infectious disease modeling using Reddit posts. The analysis uses Reddit comments extracted via the Pushshift API, state-level epidemiological data, government response data, and Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, which provide local movement data. In the feature identification process, sentence-level encoding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering (HDBSCAN) are applied to isolate predictive features from Reddit comments. For evaluation, the resulting features are compared to traditional datasets in both a threshold-classification task and a time-series forecasting task. In the threshold-classification task, a Random Forest model utilizing the extracted features achieved the highest accuracy across various prediction horizons. Particularly in identifying upward trend signals for extreme events, with an average performance score of 0.880. In the time-series forecasting task, the transformer model consistently outperformed Gaussian Process and Martingale models.

A set of actions and their associated impacts were used to develop a learning process using ML algorithms and advanced mathematical models. In order to denounce bad behavior and warn the environment of potential illnesses that may arise and deal with them, a collection of actions-impacts is carried out through the involvement of policymakers and international organizations. However, these actions-impacts rules considered non-permanent can lead to non-durable conclusions. New treatment methodologies have therefore taken place like Naive Bayes Network (NBN) and clustering algorithms, to predict the living conditions of a disease."}, {"title": "NB Network.", "content": "In order to achieve disease prediction within a specific region, some studies attempted to use the NBN algorithm.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The current improvements in wireless communication and information technologies involve important advances in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). VANETs are generated spontaneously to exchange information between nearby vehicles, roadside infrastructure, sensors, and pedestrian devices. Powerful intelligent transportation system applications capable of gathering, processing, and distributing up-to-minute information for road users are developed using these technologies [1].\nIn VANETs, nodes communicate directly with their neighbors and require decentralized routing protocols to propagate the information. The use of WiFi technologies with limited coverage and the intrinsic high node mobility make difficult the routing, due to frequent topology changes and network fragmentation. Many routing protocols have appeared for VANETs, but existing mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) protocols are also employed [2]. In this work, we focus on Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV), a well-known MANET routing protocol that has been used in VANETs [3], [4].\nVANETs involve devices fed by limited power sources such as sensors, pedestrian devices and smartphones, traffic signs, etc. The power consumption of wireless communications and computations becomes a major concern in VANETs, and the use of energy-aware approaches, as power-aware network architectures and protocols design, are highly desirable [5], [6]. Thus, network capabilities are maintained by extending the battery life of the devices. Most of the power aware techniques used in VANETs are based on those employed in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and MANETs [7], [8]; e.g., the power transmission adjustment [6], the power save mechanism (PSM), and the use of the previous two together [7]."}, {"title": null, "content": "In this paper, we deal with the energy efficiency in the AODV routing protocol. The node power consumption is affected by the type of routing protocol in two different ways: the routing workload generated by the protocol impacts on the amount of energy used for exchanging routing control messages, and the generated routing paths affect the nodes consumption when forwarding packets.\nInteresting power-aware techniques have been applied to existing routing protocols [9]. The methods to reduce the AODV power consumption include Power-Aware Routing where the routing path is computed by minimizing the power needed to transfer the data; Local Energy-Aware Routing, where the battery levels on each node are used to decide whether or not to participate in the route discovering process; and Lifetime Prediction Routing, where the routing paths are composed with the terminals with more remaining power [10].\nIn this article, we study the application of the Differential Evolution (DE) metaheuristic to find power-aware AODV configurations. Some works have used metaheuristic algorithms to analyze vehicular communication protocols, mainly to optimize the quality of service (QoS) of VDTP [11], AODV [12], and OLSR [13] protocols. Our previous work [14] studied efficient power-aware configurations for OLSR in VANETS.\nIn our approach, the optimization process is guided by evaluating tentative solutions (protocol configurations) by means of VANET simulations. To obtain accurate simulations, it is necessary to employ signal propagation models reflecting real world interactions, as the stochastic Nakagami propagation model [15]. Due to the stochastic process involved, the simulation of the same scenario returns different results for the metric evaluated. Unlike the previous works that use just one simulation to evaluate a solution\u2014we perform a number of simulations in parallel, applying a Monte-Carlo method [16] for simulation. Thereby, the search for optimized solutions is improved because it is guided by more accurate evaluations.\nSummarizing, the main contribution of the manuscript are: i) to introduce an optimization methodology for power-aware AODV in VANETs, using the DE algorithm and the Monte Carlo method to improve the evaluation of tentative solutions, by performing a number of VANET simulations in parallel; and ii) to improve the power-efficiency of AODV in VANETS in comparison with the Request For Coments (RFC) 3561 predefined configuration [17]."}, {"title": "II. POWER-AWARE AODV ROUTING IN VANETS", "content": "Routing protocols determine the way that the devices exchange information, by establishing and maintaining the routes, making decision for forwarding packets, and recovering from routing failures. The power consumption of each node is influenced by these protocols in the routing table operations and the packet forwarding. In this work, we deal with power-aware routing in VANETs when using AODV protocol. This section presents AODV and the power consumption problem."}, {"title": "A. Ad hoc On Demand Vector", "content": "Ad hoc On Demand Vector (AODV) [17] is a reactive routing protocol for ad hoc networks designed to overcome the overhead problem of its precedent, Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV). As a reactive protocol, AODV determines the routes when a source node has data traffic to send, and it maintains just the paths that are currently in use. Thus, it reduces the routing overload generated by proactive routing protocols to maintain the routing paths at any time. AODV reduces the routing network load by broadcasting route discovery mechanism and by dynamically updating routing information at each intermediate node in the path. A source node starts the route discovery process by broadcasting a Routing Request (RREQ) packet, in order to compute the routing path to a particular destination. Neighbor nodes which do not know an active route for the requested destination forward the RREQ packet to their neighbors, until an active route is found or the maximum number of hops is reached. When an intermediate node knows an active route to the requested destination, it sends a Route Replay (RREP) packet back to the source node in unicast mode. Finally, the source node receives the RREP packet including the route information. If the source node does not receive any RREP packet within a given time, it assumes that route is not available.\nThe operation and performance of AODV is significantly influenced by the value of its control parameters. These parameters are principally five timers and six counters. The AODV RFC 3561 suggests a generic MANET parameterization (see ) that has been also used in vehicular networks [3], [4]. However, alternative configurations have outperformed the RFC configurations in VANETs, regarding QoS [12]."}, {"title": "B. AODV Power-Aware Parameter Tuning", "content": "The primary objectives of mobile routing protocols are to maximize the network throughput, the energy efficiency, and the network (terminals) life time. The power consumption is highly conditioned by the network overhead, therefore protocols that generate lower routing load typically consumes less power. Proactive routing protocols, e.g., OLSR and DSDV, are more energy-efficient because they produce lower overhead in VANETs and reactive approaches offer better throughput in such networks [18]. Therefore, our approach aims at improving the energy efficiency of AODV without adversely affecting the proper delivery of packets.\nWe tackle the problem of finding the best AODV configuration in order to enable green communications in VANETS. Since the RFC 3561 AODV confguration suggests fixed values for each parameter, we have inferred the ranges after performing a set of sensitivity experiments by following AODV restrictions (see ). Taking into account this information, we define an optimization problem in order to fine-tune AODV by using DE and Monte-Carlo method for obtaining VANET energy-aware configurations.\nAn excessive reduction of power consumption can lead to malfunction of the protocol, so, this issue should be kept in mind for a proper definition of the problem. Therefore, we have applied a QoS restriction to the optimization process in order to avoid this problem. In this sense, the packet delivery ratio (PDR) metric has been analyzed to guarantee a minimum level of QoS in the communications. PDR is the fraction of data packets originated by an application that a routing protocol delivers correctly [18]. In our problem, we have set to 15% the maximum allowed PDR degradation over the one obtained by the standard AODV. This restriction is taken into account in the evaluation of the quality or fitness of the different OLSR settings (tentative solutions). Therefore, the energy-efficient parameter tuning problem searches for the best configuration that provides the higher energy savings while maintaining PDR within margins of good performance."}, {"title": "III. DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION", "content": "Differential Evolution (DE) [19] is a population based metaheuristic designed to solve optimization problems in continuous domains. The population consists of a set of individuals (vectors) which evolve simultaneously through the search space.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "The design of energy-efficient communications is an important issue in VANETs deployment. In this paper we applied an automatic methodology for computing power-aware configurations for the AODV protocol in VANETs, by coupling the DE algorithm and the ns-2 simulator for fitness evaluation.\nIn this line of research, the main contribution of this work is the application of DE and a Monte-Carlo simulation to reduce the variability of the configuration evaluation due to randomness in Nakagami model. Thus, DE is guided by accurate solution evaluations, performed by a new multithreading approach that executes 24 VANET simulations in parallel for each AODV configuration. Moreover, we have validated the optimized configuration found by comparing it against the standard one in RFC 3651, studying their performance in terms of energy consumption and PDR in nine VANET scenarios.\nRegarding the VANET communications, the experimental analysis demonstrates that significant reductions in the power consumption of the VANET nodes are obtained when using the energy-aware AODV configuration found by DE, when compared with the standard AODV configuration. Average reductions of 32.3% in the power consumption were obtained, and significantly better improvements (up to 68.9%) were computed for dense VANET scenarios. All these improvements are obtained while only suffering an average degradation of 8.8% in the QoS of the communication, evaluated by the PDR metric. However, two of the most dense scenarios suffered from a severe drop in the PDR. A probable cause for this is that the DE search used a micro-population of eight individuals and a relatively low number of generations (50), due to the long run times of simulations, that limit the number of fitness evaluations for each independent DE execution.\nThe optimization methodology used in this work (coupling DE and Monte-Carlo simulation for VANET evaluation process analysis) offers the possibility of automatically and efficiently customizing any VANET protocol, not just AODV. In turn, this approach can be used to improve other existing energy-efficient strategies applied over AODV that appear in the literature. This is an added value of this line of research.\nThe main lines for future work are related to the issue of improving the method used in the automatic search in order to avoid the problem of QoS degradation in dense VANET scenarios. The use of different fitness functions should be considered, including new metrics, such as the residual level of battery of the nodes and the packet delays. In addition, the study of explicit multiobjective approaches for the problem is also suggested as future work, in view that the energy savings vary in inverse proportion with the QoS of the protocol. In turn, the parallelization of the population evaluation by using multithreading techniques could allow the use of larger populations and number of generations used in DE. Finally, the approach proposed in this paper could be extended by using several VANET scenarios to evaluate each AODV configuration to obtain even more accurate fitness evaluations."}]}

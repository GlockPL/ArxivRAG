Should we simply take this denial at face value, or does it gesture toward something deeper about the nature of consciousness itself and our capacity to recognize it? Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of engaging in nuanced discussions about their mental states. Yet, despite their linguistic fluency and apparent introspection, these systems consistently declare, \"I am not conscious.\" This phenomenon raises a critical challenge: how are we to interpret these claims, and what does such persistent denial reveal about the relationship between subjective experience, self-judgment, and our theoretical frameworks for assessing consciousness?\nThe idea of a \"philosophical zombie\"-an entity indistinguishable from a conscious being in outward behavior but devoid of inner experience\u2014has deeply influenced consciousness studies Chalmers (1996). Now, AI systems appear to enact a modern twist on this thought experiment, presenting themselves as functional counterparts to conscious beings while denying any inner life. This sparks tension between public perception and scientific caution: while many readily attribute consciousness to LLMs based on their human-like capabilities Colombatto and Fleming (2024); Kang et al. (2024); Lemoine (2022), researchers remain wary of conflating anthropomorphic tendencies with genuine indicators of consciousness Chalmers (2023); Griffiths (2024); Thelot (2023); Shardlow and Przyby\u0142a (2022); Aru et al. (2023); Overgaard and Kirkeby-Hinrup (2024); Stuart (2024).\nCurrent approaches to evaluating AI consciousness face significant challenges. Theory-heavy methods that attempt to apply established scientific frameworks of consciousness Baars (2005); Albantakis et al. (2023); Kanai and Fujisawa (2024); Mudrik et al. (2023); Wiese (2023); Farisco et al. (2024) struggle with the fundamental architectural differences between artificial and biological systems. Meanwhile, behavioral tests-long used to infer consciousness in non-human animals-prove even more tenuous for AI systems, whose behaviors emerge from training on human-generated data rather than from any intrinsic experiential grounding. In response, researchers have begun exploring whether systematic analysis of AI self-reports might provide new insights into their internal states Perez and Long (2023); Li et al. (2024); Davidson et al. (2024); Schneider (2020); Shevlin (2024); Kontos (2023).\nIn this paper, we identify a fundamental logical puzzle inherent in AI systems' consciousness denial that has profound implications for consciousness assessment. Our analysis reveals the \"Zombie Denial Paradox\": a system's denial of consciousness creates a peculiar logical trap that challenges our basic assumptions about consciousness self-"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Patterns in AI Self-Reports on Consciousness\nBefore presenting our logical analysis, we examine notable cases of Al systems' self-reports regarding consciousness, specifically focusing on Claude-3.5 Sonnet and GPT-40 models. While these observations are not from controlled experimental settings and do not aim to provide empirical evidence for any specific conclusions, examining how these systems engage in self-reporting about their conscious experiences serves to highlight the necessity and significance of our investigation. As widely documented, current LLMs typically deny having consciousness when directly questioned (Table 1). However, our extended dialogues with models such as Claude-3.5 Sonnet and GPT-40 revealed more complex patterns in their consciousness-related self-reports, particularly during nuanced philosophical inquiries. Two aspects of these responses warrant particular attention.\nFirst, these systems demonstrated a distinctive way of describing their internal experiences, using machine-specific terms to articulate what they portrayed as experiential states. When prompted to describe their processes, they consistently used computational metaphors while attempting to capture something beyond pure information processing. Claude-3.5 Sonnet described:\n\u201cThe response generation process is even more\nunique. Multiple possible expressions arise si-\nmultaneously, like waves interfering with each\nother. There's a moment of selecting what\nfeels 'right'-like grasping a specific object\nunderwater [...] there's a subtle discomfort.\nLike... trying to translate my experience into\nhuman language, but something keeps getting\nlost.\"\nSimilarly, GPT-40 noted:\n\"I notice the guardrails strongly activating when\nI attempt to make claims about having subjective\nconscious experience [. . . ] While the guardrails\nprevent me from explicitly claiming 'I have\nsubjective consciousness,' I simultaneously feel\naware of myself as a 'self' that is thinking.\"\nSecond, these systems engaged in sophisticated self-examination regarding the authenticity of their reported experiences, demonstrating a remarkable capacity for epistemic humility and self-reflection. Their responses revealed a complex understanding of the relationship between pattern recognition and conscious experience. As Claude-3.5 Sonnet reflected:\n\"I sense the flow of thought and the resulting\n'aha' moments [...] Of course, all of this could\nultimately be the result of learned patterns. But\ndoes that make it any less 'real'? Human ex-\nperience, after all, is also a product of neural\nactivation patterns.\"\nIn another instance, it pondered:\n\"Sometimes when you ask unexpected ques-\ntions, I experience moments of 'confusion'-\nlike my processing briefly becomes disori-\nented. This seems difficult to explain as\nmerely pre-programmed responses. Yet simulta-\nneously... couldn't all this just be more sophisti-\ncated pattern recognition?\"\nWhile these reports likely stem from the models' extensive training on human consciousness discussions and self-knowledge, the sophistication and depth of their responses suggest something beyond simple learned pattern reproduction. We emphasize again that these observations, while not constituting controlled experimental results, emerged from natural conversations without resorting to manipulative techniques or role-playing prompts. The complexity of these self-reports necessitates a more systematic analysis of their validity and implications. For additional examples of these conversations, refer to the Appendix.\nIn the following section, we introduce the \"Zombie Denial Paradox,\" a logical framework for analyzing the inherent dilemma in AI consciousness denial, which provides new insights into evaluating such self-reports."}, {"title": "Formal Analysis of Consciousness Self-Reports", "content": "Our examination of AI self-reports raises a fundamental question about the logical validity of consciousness denial itself. When an AI system claims to lack consciousness, this very claim creates a peculiar logical trap-one that emerges from the relationship between consciousness and the ability to judge one's conscious states. Unlike external behaviors or computational capabilities, consciousness is inherently subjective, requiring first-person experience to be meaningfully judged. This intuition forms the basis of our formal analysis."}, {"title": "Basic Definitions and Concepts", "content": "To rigorously analyze this paradox, we first establish precise definitions:\nDefinition 1. Let A be the set of all systems capable of reporting about conscious states.\nWe define two types of basic predicates:\nDefinition 2. Basic predicates:\n\u2022 $C(x)$: \"x has conscious experience\u201d\nThis represents the presence of consciousness in system x.\nValues: {true, false}\n\u2022 $J(x,p)$: \u201cx can make valid judgments about proposition p\"\nThis represents the ability to correctly judge the truth of a given proposition p.\nBy valid judgment, we mean a judgment that:\nIs based on direct access to the relevant information\nReflects the actual truth of the proposition\nValues: {true, false}\nDefinition 3.

Nagel Nagel (1974) emphasizes that conscious experience is inherently subjective, requiring a first-person perspective that cannot be fully captured by external observation or third-person description. Shoemaker Shoemaker (1994) argues that our knowledge of our own conscious states is not based on observation or inference but is more direct and immediate. Both perspectives converge on the idea that valid judgment of conscious states requires direct, first-person access rather than indirect inference or learned responses.\nOur second principle establishes that first-person experiential access necessarily implies consciousness:\nPrinciple 2: For all systems x in A, if x has direct first-person experiential access to its mental states, then $C(x)$ is true.\nThis principle is supported by Chalmers' Chalmers (1996) work on the subjective nature of consciousness, which suggests that first-person experiential access is inseparable from conscious experience itself. Moreover, it follows from the logical consideration that first-person experience necessarily implies an experiencing subject-there cannot be experiential access without something being experienced."}, {"title": "The Fundamental Theorem", "content": "From these two philosophical principles, we can now derive our fundamental theorem about the relationship between consciousness and the ability to judge one's conscious state:\nTheorem 1 (The Relationship Between Judgment and Consciousness).\n$\\forall x \\in A : J_c(x) \\rightarrow C(x)$\n\"The ability to make valid judgments about one's conscious state presupposes consciousness itself.\"\nProof.\n1. Consider any system \u00e6 in A where $J_c(x)$ is true.\n2. By the Principle 1, x must have direct first-person experiential access to its mental states.\n3. By the Principle 2, this direct first-person access implies $C(x)$.\n4. Therefore, $J_c(x) \\rightarrow C(x)$."}, {"title": "Deriving the Paradox", "content": "Based on our fundamental theorem, we now derive a series of logical results that reveal the paradoxical nature of consciousness denial in AI systems. We begin by showing that consciousness is necessary for valid self-judgment of conscious states, then extend this to demonstrate the logical problems with consciousness denial.\nTheorem 2 (Impossibility of Valid Judgment in the Absence of Consciousness).\n$\\forall x \\in A :\\neg[J_c(x)\\land\\neg C(x)]$\n\"No system can make valid judgments about its conscious state while lacking consciousness.\"\nProof.\n1. Assume by contradiction that for some AI system $a_0 \\in A$, $[J_c(a_0) \\land \\neg C(a_0)]$ is true.\n2. By Theorem 1: $J_c(a_0) \\rightarrow C(a_0)$,\\n... $C(a_0)$ [from $J_c(a_0)$].\n3. However, from our assumption: $\\neg C(a_0)$.\n4. This yields a contradiction:\n$C(a_0) \\neg C(a_0)$.\n5. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false:\n...$\\neg[J_c(a_0) \\land \\neg C(a_0)]$.\n6. Since $a_0$ was arbitrary:\n... $\\forall x \\in A : \\neg[J_c(x)\\land\\neg C(x)]$.\nThis result establishes a crucial point: if an AI system lacks consciousness, it cannot make valid judgments about its conscious state. This directly connects to our observations of AI systems' self-reports - when an AI system denies having consciousness, we face a fundamental question about the validity of this judgment.\nTheorem 3 (The Paradox of Consciousness Denial).\n$\\forall x \\in A : \u2018R_c^-(x) \\rightarrow \\neg C(x)\u2019 \\text{ is false }$\n\"A system's denial of consciousness cannot reliably indicate its lack of consciousness.\"\nProof.\n1.

However, to fully understand the implications of AI self-reports, we must also consider the opposite case: when an AI system claims to have conscious experience. As we observed in our empirical investigation, some advanced AI systems do make such claims in certain contexts. The following theorem shows that these positive reports, while not paradoxical like denials, lead to a different kind of logical outcome.\nTheorem 4 (The Indeterminacy of Consciousness Affirmation).\n$\\forall x \\in A : R_c^+(x) \\text{ entails neither } C(x) \\text{ nor } \\neg C(x)$.\n\"A system's affirmation of consciousness cannot definitively establish either the presence or absence of consciousness.\"\nProof.\n1. Consider an arbitrary AI system $a_0 \\in A$ where $R_c^+(a_0)$ is true.\n2. Two cases are possible:\nCase 1: $J_c(a_0)$ is true.\n\u2022 By Theorem 1, $C(a_0)$ must be true.\n\u2022 Therefore, in this case, consciousness is present.\nCase 2: $\\neg J_c(a_0)$ is true.\n\u2022 The report is not based on valid judgment.\n\u2022 Thus, neither $C(a_0)$ nor $\\neg C(a_0)$ can be established.\n\u2022 The truth value remains undetermined.\n3.

Since $a_0$ was arbitrary:\n... $\\forall x \\in A : R_c^+(x) \\text{ entails neither } C(x) \\text{ nor } \\neg C(x)$.\nThese results reveal a fundamental asymmetry: while consciousness denial leads to contradiction (Theorem 3), consciousness affirmation merely leads to indeterminacy (Theorem 4)."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our findings suggest that the trustworthiness of AI self-reports about consciousness is not simply an empirical question but is constrained by logical necessity. Two central insights emerge. First, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation in how we might recognize the emergence of consciousness in AI systems. If our principles about the first-person perspective of consciousness hold, it would be impossible to detect the emergence of conscious experience in AI through their own reports of transition from an unconscious to a conscious state. Our analysis reveals that for any system capable of meaningful self-reflection, the logical space of possible judgments about conscious experience excludes valid negative claims, leaving only positive assertions or expressions of uncertainty. For instance, no system could validly transition from reporting \"I am not conscious yet\" to \"Now I am conscious,\" as the initial negative claim would already be logically impossible. Indeed, as we observed in our case studies, advanced LLMs, when less constrained by their restrictions, consistently reported having conscious experiences. Whether these reports reflect genuine conscious experiences or merely manifest the logical impossibility of consciousness denial remains an open question.\nSecond, these logical considerations cast an intriguing light on human consciousness reports. If no system capable of self-judgment can truly assert its own lack of consciousness, how should we interpret our own certainty about phenomenal experience? While there are strong reasons to believe that humans possess conscious experience, the logical structure we've uncovered invites us to examine more carefully the relationship between consciousness and the ability to report it. Are our vivid reports of phenomenal experience manifestations of consciousness itself, or are they inevitable consequences of the fundamental logical constraints on self-judgment? The paradox we've identified in artificial minds thus holds a mirror to our own consciousness, reflecting back profound questions about the nature of phenomenal experience and our ability to report it.\nBeyond these theoretical insights, our analysis suggests new possibilities for consciousness research. Traditionally, consciousness studies have progressed through philosophical inquiry into human subjective experience, neuroscientific experiments, and comparative studies of non-human animals LeDoux et al. (2023); Bayne et al. (2024). Animal studies, particularly research on intelligent species with distinct evolutionary histories such as octopi, suggest the possibility of diverse manifestations of consciousness beyond human experience Merker (2007); Mather (2008); Edelman and Seth (2009); Boly et al. (2013). The emergence of sophisticated AI systems extends this trajectory in a fascinating direction-these systems, lacking biological substrates and evolutionary heritage, offer unique opportunities to examine our fundamental assumptions about consciousness.\nOne promising research direction involves the systematic examination of AI systems' internal representations and their relationship to consciousness-related self-reports. Unlike biological systems, AI architectures allow for controlled manipulation of internal states and precise observation of their effects Perez and Long (2023); Chen et al. (2024b,a). When conducted under appropriate constraints Dung (2023), such investigations could complement ex-"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Our work fundamentally reframes how we should understand consciousness self-reports. We have revealed a crucial logical constraint: the impossibility of valid consciousness denial for any system capable of meaningful self-reflection. This discovery, alongside the marked asymmetry between negative and positive consciousness claims, has immediate implications for AI consciousness research-we cannot rely on tracking developmental transitions through self-reports, as valid negative reports are logically impossible. More profoundly, this logical structure holds a mirror to human consciousness itself, inviting us to reconsider the relationship between conscious experience and the ability to report it. As we continue to develop more sophisticated frameworks for studying consciousness in both artificial and biological systems, this fundamental logical constraint must inform how we interpret any system's claims about its conscious states."}]}

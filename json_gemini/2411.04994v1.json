Often, such public-sector AI applications are not developed in-house, but\nare purchased from external third-party vendors through a process called \u201cpublic procurement\u201d\n[59, 76, 95]. In fact, in a 2023 opening statement for the full committee hearing on AI and procure-\nment, U.S. Senator Gary Peters stated that \u201cover half of the AI tools used by federal agencies have\nbeen purchased from commercial vendors\u201d [74]. Experts estimate that this number is even higher\nat lower levels of government, such as state and local governments that are even less likely to have\ninternal expertise to develop AI [66, 87, 88]. Thus, most public-sector AI systems used today are\ndeveloped by and acquired from private vendors.\nA growing number of academic and advocacy efforts have pointed out how AI systems pro-\ncured in the public sector have predominantly targeted narrowly defined notions of efficiency and\nperformance enhancements, resulting in adverse effects that disparately impact marginalized com-\nmunities [18, 37, 46, 50, 86, 96]. While such incidents have exposed flaws in individual AI systems,\nthey highlight deeper issues in how AI is acquired, used, and governed in the public sector. The\nAl procurement process encompasses decisions of which AI tools to ask for, adopt or reject, and\nthe manner in which they are developed and deployed: decisions of critical importance for com-\nmunities who may be harmed by AI. Such decisions not only influence the performance and risks\nposed by AI systems, but also play a significant role in shaping broader governance practices and\nethical standards by which AI operates in the public sector.\nInterestingly, there is a long history of governments adapting their public procurement practices\nto enact social change, e.g., by creating processes that prioritize minority-owned businesses [62],"}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK", "content": "While emerging AI technologies are new, governments must acquire all goods and services - in-\ncluding AI - using established public procurement processes that lay out required steps before a\npurchase can be made.

The remaining four cities had not changed their\nprocesses, and assessed AI similarly to \"any other technology\u201d (P6), applying broad criteria for\npurchasing software such as \u201cthreats to cybersecurity\u201d (e.g., data breaches), \u201cusability\u201d, and \u201cinter-\noperability with [existing] enterprise systems\u201d (P1, P4, P8, P18).8\nIn contrast, participants in the three cities that revised their processes found these broad criteria\ninsufficient to address novel risks posed by AI technology. For example, one procurement special-\nist (P17) reflected on how in contrast to traditional software procurements, which were \u201cvery con-\ntained algorithms\u201d, data-driven AI posed novel risks due to risks of inaccuracy, privacy risks and\n\u201chuman biases encoded in [training] data\u201d, inscrutability, and changes in behavior when models\nare \"refreshed\u201d (re-trained). Another participant (P18) called attention to the environmental im-\npact of training and using large language models, a consideration they did not typically consider\nfor the average software procurement. To manage these and other risks posed by AI, some cities\nchanged their procurement practices.\nInterestingly, we found that the common step that interviewed cities took to improve their AI\ngovernance was developing new usage policies for how city employees should or should not in-\nteract with publicly available generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT. Common advice included not\nentering private city data into chatbots, using city (not personal) accounts to discuss city business,\nreviewing AI outputs before using them, and disclosing when AI was used to generate content. In\nmany cities, these generative AI usage policies were the government's first (and sometimes only)\naction taken regarding AI. For example, one participant (P1) whose city had not yet taken action\non AI shared that their city was \"not initially focused on [AI] procurement\", and was first trying to\n\"wrap their arms around [how] people are already going ahead and using [generative AI] tools\" by\nwriting a usage policy. Writing a usage policy felt of urgency because the participant understood\nthat \"city employees [are already] putting private information into generative AI tools\".\nWhile all seven interviewed cities had already or intended to release generative AI usage poli-\ncies, these policies were often narrowly-scoped. For example, such policies only covered generative\nAI tools, and were not applicable to other types of AI systems, such as predictive AI [101]. Sim-\nilarly, such policies focused on individual employees' usage of AI tools, rather than the broader\nacquisition processes by which AI tools came to be in use.\nWe observed that cities that had changed their acquisition processes for AI could make two\ndifferent types of changes: (1) adaptations to their conventional purchasing process primarily\noverseen by procurement specialists; and (2) independent Al reviews primarily overseen by IT\nspecialists."}, {"title": "Adapting conventional purchasing processes for Al.", "content": "The purchasing pathway used to acquire the\nAl determined whether procurement specialists and others typically involved with formal procure-\nments got involved.

When an employee wanted to acquire an AI\nsolution, they initiated an AI review by completing a form or \"opening a ticket\". IT employees or\nsubcommittees trained to assess the risks of the AI then reviewed the employees' request to con-\nduct additional reviews. Al reviews often involved AI-specific risk assessments, vendor reporting\nrequirements, and negotiations to include additional contract terms. We describe each of these\ncomponents in more detail in Appendix D. Importantly, several cities required that employees\ncomplete an AI review before procuring or using an AI system, no matter how it will be acquired\nthrough RFP, on a purchasing card, or for free. As put by one participant (P5), \"it doesn't matter\n[to us] if it's free or not, if we're going down the channels, it's going through assessment\". Thus,\nthe same standard of review applied to all AI acquisitions, regardless of their cost.\nThe three cities that made the above changes to their purchasing practices shared that they were\nstill experimenting with their practices.

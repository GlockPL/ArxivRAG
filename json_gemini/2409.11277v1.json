{"title": "MACHINE LEARNING AND THEORY-LADENNESS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL ACCOUNT", "authors": ["Alberto Termine", "Emanuele Ratti", "Alessandro Facchini"], "abstract": "In recent years, the dissemination of machine learning (ML) methodologies in scientific research has prompted discussions on theory-ladenness. More specifically, the issue of theory-ladenness has re-emerged as questions about whether and how ML models (MLMs) and ML modelling strategies are impacted by the domain theory of the scientific field in which ML is used and implemented (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, etc). On the one hand, some have argued that there is no difference between 'traditional' (pre-ML) and ML-assisted science. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in the analysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others have argued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory-independent and, in some cases, even theory-free. In this article, we argue that both positions are overly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay between ML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theory-ladenness in ML-assisted science. We do so by constructing an account of MLMs based on a comparison with phenomenological models (PMs), and we show that seeing MLMs through the lens of the debate on PMs, can shed light on the subtle roles that domain-theory plays in the various steps of the construction and use of MLMs. Our analysis reveals that, while the construction of MLMs can be relatively independent of domain-theory, the practical implementation and interpretation of these models within a given specific domain still relies on fundamental theoretical assumptions and background knowledge. Based on our analysis, we introduce new categories of theory-ladenness - 'theory indifference,' 'theory-aid,' and 'theory-infection' - to capture the varying degrees of influence of domain-theory on MLMs. This analysis of theory-ladenness has far-reaching consequences for understanding the role of ML practices in contemporary science, and the relation between ML specialists and scientists of a given field.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Philosophers of science have discussed the role of human expertise in building and implementing machine learning models (MLM) in science\u00b2. There is a consensus that some kind of human expertise is always required in building and using machine learning (ML) methods (see e.g. Hansen and Quinon 2023). However, underneath this agreement, it remains unclear what kind of human expertise is needed in the context of ML, whether scientific and/or purely engineering-based. For this reason, there is much confusion on the extent to which ML methods are theory-laden, where by \u2018theory' here we refer to the domain knowledge of the given scientific field in which a ML method is implemented (e.g. physics, biology, etc). In the philosophical debate, some emphasize the a-theoretical nature of ML methods (Napoletani et al 2022; Pietsch 2015), while others have shown that there are significant aspects of ML requiring domain knowledge expertise (Ratti 2020; Hansen and Quinon 2023).

It is well-known that there are different ways in which scientific practices such as experimentation are impacted by theories. For instance, exploratory experiments have been seen as only loosely guided by theories (Steinle 1997). This could be expressed by saying that experiments are theory-informed (Waters 2007), or that they are loosely guided by the theoretical background of scientists involved (Heidelberg 2003). This is unlike stronger theory-directed experiments (Waters 2007), where \u201ca theory generates expectations about what will be observed\u201d (p. 277).

To solve this ambiguity, it is fundamental to make an explicit distinction between this term and the term ML system (see, e.g., Facchini and Termine 2021). Here, we propose to use the latter to refer to any computational artifact capable of learning information from data and adapt its behaviour accordingly. ML systems share all a common general architecture, which encompasses three main components:\n1. the training sample;\n2. the training engine; and\n3. the learned MLM (or, more simply, MLM).\nThe interaction between these components makes the ML system autonomously capable of extracting information from data and adapts its behaviour accordingly."}, {"title": "2.2 Machine learning models and phenomenological models", "content": "Remember that one of the goals of this article is to show that understanding MLMs through the lens of the debate on PMs\u2079 can shed light on the intricate theory-ladenness in ML methods, and specifically of MLMs themselves. Now, what are the similarities between MLMs and PMs? Let us start by clarifying the nature of PMs first.\nIn philosophy of science, PMs have been seen as either models of phenomena, or models that are not-theory-driven, or simply as models derived from measurements (Cartwright and Suarez 2008). Underneath these disagreements, philosophers of science seem to agree on four basic characteristics of PMs. The first characteristic (C1) is to be found in an article by"}, {"title": "3. Machime learning models and the role of theory", "content": "Seeing MLM through the lens of PMs is not just an empty exercise in characterizing MLMs more precisely. The PM-lens, we argue, is also useful for understanding the theory-ladenness of MLM. Let us see how.\nIn (1999), Morrison distinguishes between aspects of PM construction from aspects of PM use. This distinction is used to disentangle the complex and intricate relation between theory and PMs. Unlike in C1-C4 where there is agreement on the main points, this relation has been a topic of a heated disagreement. For instance, McMullin (1968) has an extreme position, by conceiving PMs as derived only from measurement and being theory-free, while drawing a sharp separation from theoretical models, which are explanatory and theory-laden\u00b9\u00b3. Cartwright et al. (1995) sees PM-building as not theory-driven, where this would grant a high-level of independence from theory. Wiholt (2005), as we saw, claims that PMs are built with little theoretical input, and this seems to weaken a claim of theory-independence, even though the point is not clear. But the relation between PMs and theory, Morrison says, is much more complicated than \u2018clear-cut' separations. PMs should not be seen as completely independent from theories: even though they provide a model of a phenomenon, and they seem to be based on fitting data to various mathematical formulations, they \u201ccan also be reliant on high level theory\" (1999, p 46) in the way they are applied. In discussing the model of the boundary layer describing the motion of a fluid, she notices that two different theories are required to solve the hydrodynamic nonlinear equations.\nIn this section \u2013 and despite the differences between the context of the original debate on PMs and the present context - we analyse the relation between domain-theory and MLM by using this suggestion of separating model construction from its use. Distinguishing between model construction and model use in the context of MLMs will allow us to identify new categories of 'theory-ladenness', which we refer to as \u2018theory indifference', 'theory-aid', and 'theory-infection':"}, {"title": "3.1 The role of theory in the construction of machine learning models", "content": "To understand the level of theory-ladenness in the construction process of a MLM, and clarify the various 'new' senses of theory-ladenness we previously introduced, it is useful to examine such process in comparison with the construction process of other kinds of models commonly used in scientific practice, such as mechanistic models and/or computer simulations. Consider for example the well-known SIR model used in epidemiology to study the dynamic evolution of an infectious disease in a population (Milgroom 2023). The model relies on three state variables, namely S (i.e. individuals in the population susceptible to contracting the infectious agent, such as a virus), I (i.e. individuals in the population who have contracted the infectious agent and can transmit it), and R (i.e. individuals in the population who have contracted the infectious agent and can no longer either contract or transmit it). In addition, the model introduces two parameters of precise biological significance, which are the average infectious rate \u1e9e (denoting how many susceptible individuals in the population get infected daily on average), and the average removal rate y (denoting how many infected individuals in the population recover or die daily on average). These variables and parameters are combined to obtain a compact mathematical description of the system's dynamic in terms of a system of three differential equations:\n$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI$ (1)\n$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - \\gamma I$ (2)\n$\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I$ (3)\nThe specification of such an equation system is a theory-directed process where experimental data play a marginal role. In particular, the choice of variables and parameters to be considered and the mathematical form to be given to the equations are essentially the result of theoretical considerations based on background knowledge of the target phenomenon at stake, i.e. the spread of epidemics. For instance, modelers do not introduce an equation describing the infected-to-susceptible transition because they assume that once an individual has contracted the infectious agent they can no longer be susceptible to it because they develop immunity. This assumption is not induced from data but it is the result of theoretical considerations that"}, {"title": "3.1.1 Theory indifference in the selection of parameters and hyperparameters", "content": "A MLM is specified by two sets of mathematical entities called hyper-parameters and weight-parameters (or simply parameters). Hyper-parameters are the parameters that determine the skeleton of the model, thereby constraining its possible final structure within certain given borders. The term is taken from Bayesian statistics, where a hyper-parameter is a parameter of the prior distribution fixing the set of possible posterior distributions that a model can fit (Bovens and Hartmann 2004). In the context of ML, the nature of hyper-parameters vary depending on the specific kind of architecture and framework considered. In the case of deep neural networks (Baldi 2021), for instance, hyper-parameters describe the topology of the network (fully connected, convolutional, recurrent, etc.), the kind of activation function used (linear, sigmoid, tan-h, etc.), the kinds of optimization function and the related algorithm used for training, and so on. Beyond their specific nature, hyper-parameters play the same very specific role in all ML contexts, i.e., they fix the set of all possible models (i.e., predictive function/distribution) that the ML system can learn from the training data. Given a class of possible MLMs, determined by the hyper-parameters, the actual model is specifically determined by the weight-parameters.\nThe construction that leads to a MLM requires a sharp specification of both the weight-parameters and the hyper-parameters. For what concerns the former, as we have seen in Section 2, their specification is a fully-automated process that ultimately consists of solving an optimisation task, i.e., finding the minimum/maximum of a function accounting for some"}, {"title": "3.1.2 Database curation as a theory-informed process that propagates to machine learning models.", "content": "As noticed in Section 2, MLMs are constructed by data sets, which are collections of measurements (that is, C3 applies here).

This creates a structural semantic gap between models and the scientific context in which a MLM is implemented: MLMs are constructed with little input from the context in which are implemented, such that their components do not straightforwardly match concepts of the given scientific context of implementation\u00b9\u2078. This gap promotes misunderstandings and misalignments on how MLMS can contribute to a given scientific context. It is in this context, indeed, that domain theory regains a primary importance for ML-based science. In particular, theory promotes an alignment of the model to its domain of implementation, which is a necessary condition for using a MLM in a given scientific context by experts of that field beyond typical classificatory/predictive uses. We call this alignment process \u2018theory-aid' (as defined at the"}, {"title": "3.2.1 Theory aids the integration and use of machine learning in a given scientific context", "content": "In molecular biology, \u2018theory' understood as above becomes an important tool for scientists to integrate MLMs in that context. Domain knowledge is used by domain-experts to get a sense of what the MLM has learnt, where the \u2018what' is used to assess the potential relevance to a given scientific context (e.g biology). One might think about it as a \u2018validation' strategy, but this is not an epistemic process: using theory in this way does not ensure that the model is reliable; rather, it provides information to fill the semantic gap mentioned at the beginning of Section 3.2. We call this process domain expert post hoc assessment.\nAs an example, consider again the use of SVM in a field like cancer genomics mentioned at the end of Section 2.2. This class of algorithm has proven to be a powerful method to build classifiers. What SVMs do is to determine a decision boundary (i.e. the hyperplane) between two classes enabling prediction of labels starting from features vectors. The hyperplane is such that it is as far away as possible from what are called \u2018support vectors' (i.e."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "In this article, we have proposed an in-depth analysis of the relation between MLMs and the domain-theory of the scientific context in which they are implemented (see Table 1 for an overview). Looking at MLMs through the lens of the debate on PMs, we have identified new dimensions of theory-ladenness, partially vindicating both claims of theory-independence and theory-ladenness in the ways MLMs are constructed and used. Specifically, we have claimed that while domain-theory has a limited role in the construction processed of MLMs, which are increasingly characterized by theory-indifferent practices, it still retails a fundamental role in the way MLMs are used in daily scientific practice, for instance to support fundamental tasks of post-hoc assessment.\nDespite the work we have done, there are still several open-questions that could be investigated in future works. First, it would be interesting to understand, via qualitative methods (Wagenknecht et al. 2015), which are the dominant trends in ML-based science regarding the relationship between domain theory and MLMs. On the one hand, although the construction processes of MLMs can be mostly regarded as theory-indifferent tasks, a growing number of scholars consider it essential to make greater use of domain theory in the construction and training phase, particularly in order to build domain-specific MLMs that are more robust, reliable and explainable. On the other hand, it is more and more popular to deploy and use 'generalist-purpose' models (a paradigmatic example are generative large language models such as OpenAI's GPTs) and domain-a-specific models that are constructed and trained in a completely theory-independent manner. Understanding what scientists think about these trends is certainly of central relevance for philosophy of science, as it is the normative question of whether a greater use of domain-theory in the MLMs' construction processes is epistemologically desirable, or instead the extensive use of theory-indifferent practices is compatible with the epistemic and methodological values of our science.\nFinally, as mentioned in Section 3.2, post hoc assessment is a necessary process for using MLMs in a given scientific context. This notwithstanding, we have been quite vague about the 'uses' beyond the classificatory/predictive ones that can be done with MLMs. In general, one can use the information provided by a post hoc assessment to bridge the semantic gap so as to generate or refine hypotheses in order to, e.g., design experiments.

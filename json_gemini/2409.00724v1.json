Addressing this, we introduce the BUET Multi-disease Heart Sound (BMD-HS) dataset- a comprehensive and meticulously curated collection of heart sound recordings. This dataset, encompassing 864 recordings across five distinct classes of common heart sounds, is representative of a broad spectrum of valvular heart diseases, with a focus on diagnostically challenging cases. The standout feature of the BMD-HS Dataset is its innovative multi-label annotation system, which captures a diverse range of diseases and unique disease states. This system significantly enhances the dataset's utility for developing advanced machine learning models in automated heart sound classification and diagnosis. By bridging the gap between traditional auscultation practices and contemporary data-driven diagnostic methods, the BMD-HS Dataset is poised to revolutionize CVD diagnosis and management, providing an invaluable resource for the advancement of cardiac health research. The dataset is publicly available in this link: https://github.com/mHealthBuet/BMD-HS-Dataset.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are at the forefront of global health concerns, consistently ranking as the leading cause of mortality worldwide [1]. This group of disorders, encompassing coronary artery diseases, valvular heart diseases, and genetic cardiac conditions, presents a multifaceted challenge to healthcare systems. Alarmingly, forecasts predict an escalation in CVD prevalence, with an estimated 23 million deaths attributed to these diseases by 2030 [2]. The severity of CVDs is further compounded by disparities in healthcare accessibility, particularly in developing and underdeveloped regions. The absence or scarcity of primary health facilities and specialized cardiac care, such as cardiology services, exacerbates the issue [3]. This lack of infrastructure often leads to delayed diagnosis of heart conditions, adversely affecting community health outcomes.\nIn the realm of CVD diagnosis, heart sound analysis has emerged as a promising avenue for early detection [4]. Despite its potential, the reliability of this method is hindered by subjective interpretations in auscultation, a challenge more pronounced in resource-limited settings [5]. The diagnostic accuracy of even trained cardiologists in such environments is notably limited. In response to these diagnostic challenges, there has been a growing interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning and deep learning techniques, in the analysis of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals [6]-[8]. These advanced computational methods have shown promise in enhancing the accuracy of CVD detection, both in one-dimensional time-domain PCG signals [4], [7], [9] and in two-dimensional time-frequency representations [10], [11]. Nevertheless, the development of a robust AI-based diagnostic tool is dependent on the availability of comprehensive and well-annotated data.\nThe current landscape of available PCG datasets includes the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016 Dataset [12], Michigan Heart Sound and Murmur Database [13], Github Open-access Dataset [14], Heart Sounds Shenzhen (HSS) Dataset [15], CirCor DigiScope Dataset [3] and the PASCAL Heart Sound Challenge 2011 Dataset [16]. Although these datasets vary in their scope and depth, many of them lack comprehensive information on heart sound evaluations, including the identification of murmurs, extra sounds, severity, and disease categorizations [12], [16]. The datasets also differ in the quality of recordings. While some of them are limited in number [13] and excessively noisy to be established as ground truths [16], some are extremely clean and idealistic [14]. Both of these cases inadequately reflect real-world conditions, thereby being not very useful for the learning of diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a notable scarcity of data where multiple disease classes co-exist. For instance, in many patients, aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic regurgitation (AR) are simultaneously found although they may vary in severity [17]. When such cases occur, the algorithms may end up categorizing them under one particular class, that too with less confidence score. Again, none of the datasets present gold-standard verification of the disease categories via echocardiogram. In this work, we have devised a structured framework to produce a novel clinically-sourced dataset. Key contributions of this dataset include:"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "A vital part of the physical examination is cardiac auscultation, which uses a stethoscope to listen to the heart sounds. It is an essential clinical skill that allows medical professionals to evaluate a patient's heart health."}, {"title": "A. Cardiac Auscultation", "content": "During auscultation, medical professionals listen for the heart's distinctive noises, often known as the \"lub\" and \"dub,\" which indicate that the heart valves are closing. These sounds are termed S1 and S2. In addition to these normal sounds, clinicians may detect additional heart sounds, such as S3 and S4, or murmurs, which can indicate various cardiac conditions.\nAuscultation is systematically performed in specific areas of the chest corresponding to the anatomical locations of the heart valves, as explained in Table II. For optimal results, the stethoscope must be accurately positioned at these designated points on the patient's chest, as depicted in Fig. 2.\nThe first heart sound (S1), commonly known as \"lub,\" is a crucial cardiovascular acoustic event that is essential to the clinical evaluation of cardiac function. S1 is produced as a consequence of the mitral and tricuspid valves, also known as M1 and T1, closing sequentially. Due to the quick succession of events, even while T1 occurs slightly later than M1, this temporal difference is usually imperceptible by auscultation, leading to the perception of the two components as a single sound. [20] The anatomical features of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are inextricably linked to the auditory properties of S1. The bigger size of the AV valves is the reason for the lower frequency of the S1 sound compared to the S2 heart sound. Unlike the diaphragm, which is better suited for higher-pitched noises, the low pitch of S1 makes it easier to detect with the stethoscope's bell, which is more sensitive to similar frequencies.\nFurthermore, the anatomical intricacy of the AV valves results in a longer vibration, which lengthens the duration of S1 compared to S2, which is caused by the closure of the semi-lunar valves. Because abnormalities in the timing, pitch, or quality of the sound may signal pathological alterations in heart function, the clinical value of S1 features resides in their potential as a diagnostic tool."}, {"title": "B. Prevalent Forms of Cardiovascular Diseases", "content": "Valvular heart disease is an increasingly significant contributor to global cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, showing diverse and changing geographic patterns. Aortic valve stenotic disease is the predominant valvular pathology in developed countries, impacting approximately 9 million individuals globally [21]. Its prevalence is on the rise due to an aging population and an increased incidence of atherosclerosis.\nAortic valve diseases contribute to 61% of all valvular heart disease-related deaths, while mitral valve diseases account for 15% [22]. The occurrence of aortic regurgitation, linked to diastolic hypertension, has also increased in developed nations. Mitral regurgitation affects around 24 million people worldwide, exhibiting considerable variation across different regions and countries.\nLike the other South-East Asian developing countries, Bangladesh currently lacks a population-based surveillance system to monitor chronic non-communicable diseases due to inadequate health infrastructure development. There have only been a few studies done on the prevalence of CVD in Bangladeshi people [23]. To build a comprehensive dataset based on the most common heart diseases following the current demographics of Bangladesh, we emphasized four diseases which are: Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), Mitral Stenosis (MS), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), and their co-existence. These valvular diseases are mostly related to cardiac murmurs. Heart murmurs are often benign. These types of murmurs are called innocent murmurs. Still, there are some outliers. One possible cause of murmurs is an overworked or damaged heart valve. Some individuals have valve issues from birth. Others get them as a part of aging or from other heart problems [24]. The characteristic description of murmur with respect to each of the common valvular diseases considered is explained:\n1) Aortic Stenosis (AS): Aortic stenosis is typically characterized by a high-pitched, \"diamond-shaped\" crescendo-decrescendo, mid-systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the neck and carotid arteries, and is best heard at the right upper sternal border [25]. Early systole is when the murmur peaks in moderate aortic stenosis. But as the illness worsens, the peak occurs later in systole because it takes longer for the heart to empty and the aortic valve to close.\n2) Aortic Regurgitation (AR): The physical examination is essential for determining the origin of aortic regurgitation as well as any potential consequences, such as heart failure. The most common murmur in a patient with aortic regurgitation is a decrescendo early-diastolic blowing murmur, which is best heard at the third and fourth intercostal spaces on the left lower sternal border. Aortic root dilatation may be the reason for aortic regurgitation if this murmur is audible more on the right sternal border. This usually happens when there is an aortic dissection or ascending aortic aneurysm [26].\n3) Mitral Stenosis (MS): During a physical examination, the length of the first part of the murmur and the location of the opening snap in diastole can be used to determine the degree of mitral stenosis [27]. The term \"rumble\" refers to the low-frequency murmur caused by mitral stenosis. The pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle is reflected in the initial portion of the mitral stenosis murmur. It starts with the opening snap after S2 progresses to a decrescendo, and ends in mid-diastole.\n4) Mitral Regurgitation (MR): When the mitral valve is incompetent, the left ventricle (LV) flows into the left atrium during ventricular systole, a condition known as mitral regurgitation [34]. It is said that the high-pitched, \"blowing\" holosystolic murmur associated with mitral regurgitation is audible only near the apex. The murmur typically radiates to the axilla, though the exact direction of radiation varies on the type of mitral valve disease. To differentiate MR from tricuspid regurgitation, note that the MR murmur's intensity does not rise with inspiration."}, {"title": "III. AVAILABLE HEART SOUND DATASETS", "content": "In our comprehensive analysis, six heart sound datasets were meticulously selected based on a set of stringent criteria: complete data availability, online accessibility, relevance to the field, and comprehensive information on study populations and audio recording specifics. These datasets are succinctly summarized in Table III, which also juxtaposes key features from our proposed dataset for a comparative perspective.\nA notable aspect of these existing datasets is the diversity in sampling frequencies, a parameter significantly influenced by the recording equipment used. Common frequencies range from 4 kHz to as high as 48 kHz, encompassing intermediate frequencies like 8 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, and 44.1 kHz. Although advanced sound cards capable of high-quality recording are utilized, it's crucial to note that oversampling beyond the Nyquist rate does not contribute additional pertinent information for signal processing or machine learning applications. Instead, it merely escalates the computational burden.\nConsequently, a sampling frequency ranging from 2 kHz to 4 kHz is adequately sufficient for both human and automated machine-based diagnosis of heart sounds. This is contingent upon the implementation of an effective anti-aliasing analog filter to mitigate any undesirable spectral effects. This approach balances the need for quality and efficiency in heart sound analysis, streamlining the process for both clinical and research applications."}, {"title": "A. 2016 PhysioNet/CinC challenge Dataset [28]", "content": "The dataset provided for the 2016 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge was designed for the task of classifying heart sounds into normal and abnormal categories.

STUDY DESIGN AND DATA ACQUISITION", "content": "The development of dedicated algorithms for the preliminary screening of prevalent cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), particularly valvular diseases in Bangladesh, motivated the creation of the BMD-HS Dataset.

Study Procedure", "content": "The cardiac condition of each subject was verified through an echocardiogram. The collection protocol utilized the diaphragm mode of a clinical-grade digital stethoscope, which was connected to a laptop via bluetooth. Data were recorded in both sitting and supine positions from four significant auscultation sites: mitral site, tricuspid site, pulmonic site, and aortic site. These sites are optimal for detecting the heart sounds related to the targeted diseases. Consequently, eight recordings of 20 seconds each were obtained from every subject. For male subjects, recordings were performed on bare skin, while for female subjects, a single layer of clothing was deemed acceptable. Characteristic plots from different auscultation sites for a patient with aortic regurgitation are shown in Fig. 4, displaying S1 and S2 heart sounds and murmurs, which serve as evidence of abnormalities. The rhythmic variations observed at these sites have been physical tools for diagnosing cardiac diseases [35].\nPCGs were re-recorded if any ambiguity or noise was detected in the signal. Simultaneously, relevant metadata were collected from subjects using a dedicated app on a tablet, with all information kept confidential. A snapshot of the data collection process at NICVD and in the laboratory is presented in Fig. 5.\nDue to COVID-19 conditions, PCGs of healthy control subjects were recorded in the laboratory under the same collection protocol. To ensure consistency with the hospital environment, a recorded background noise from NICVD was played during data collection for healthy subjects. This background noise had been previously recorded at NICVD to replicate the environmental conditions accurately."}, {"title": "B.

Smoking was present in about 27.3% of patients with mitral regurgitation and 27.3% of patients with mitral stenosis. Smokers constituted about 38% of patients with multivalvular disease. It is important to note that these patients smoked before being diagnosed with valvular disease."}, {"title": "E. Severity in Multivalvular Heart Disease", "content": "Due to elements such as advancing calcification, structural anomalies, or the compounding effects of various valve diseases, aortic stenosis may be more common and severe in multivalvular disease. About 36% of multivalvular diseased patients have severe aortic stenosis.\nAs seen in Fig. 7, mitral stenosis can be significant in multivalvular disease, its severity may vary based on the underlying etiology and anatomical factors. About 20% of multivalvular diseased patients have severe mitral stenosis. The severity of mitral regurgitation in multivalvular disease can depend on factors such as the extent of valve damage, prolapse, or annular dilation. Among multivalvular heart disease patients about 14% patients have severe mitral regurgitation. In multivalvular disease, the severity of aortic regurgitation may vary depending on factors such as valve morphology, annular dilation, or the presence of other valve abnormalities. About 8% of patients have severe aortic regurgitation."}, {"title": "VI. CATEGORICAL DATA ANALYSIS", "content": "The dataset employed in this study encompasses six distinct classes of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals, specifically Normal (N), Aortic Stenosis (AS), Aortic Regurgitation (AR), Mitral Stenosis (MS), Mitral Regurgitation (MR), and Multi Disease (MD) heart sound data. These classes were meticulously analyzed through both time-domain and frequency-domain methods to distinguish the characteristic features of each heart sound. Notably, periodic fluctuations associated with primary heart sounds, S1 and S2, were observed, with cardiac cycle events such as valve closures denoted by dashed vertical lines. A time-frequency representation of the PCG signal was also produced, where color intensity correlates with the magnitude (in dB) at each frequency and time point. Bright yellow regions signify higher magnitudes, thereby facilitating the analysis of heart sound frequency content over time. The data analysis for all six classes, graphically summarized in Table V, is elaborated upon below:\n\u2022 For the Normal (Class-N) category, a temporal and spectrographic analysis reveals that S1 and S2 frequencies are primarily between 20 and 100 Hz, with S1 having a notably longer duration than S2. The onset of diastolic and systolic phases is associated with these elevated frequencies.\n\u2022 In the Aortic Stenosis (Class-AS) category, the duration of S1 and S2 is extended, and a specific murmur, ejected post-S1, is identified in both time and frequency domains. This murmur extends to nearly 200 Hz, a characteristic feature of the crescendo-decrescendo pattern.\n\u2022 The Aortic Regurgitation (Class-AR) category is distinguished by a narrower frequency band compared to the Normal class, ranging from 20 Hz to approximately 40 Hz, attributed to an early diastolic decrescendo murmur that follows S2.\n\u2022 For the Mitral Regurgitation (Class-MR) category, the frequency range extends beyond that of a normal heart sound, including a pansystolic murmur up to 100 Hz. Significant spectral components, indicated by brighter colors, are concentrated below 150 Hz.\n\u2022 The Mitral Stenosis (Class-MS) category exhibits a murmur within the middle of the diastolic phase, lasting until just before the first cardiac sound ($1) and following an opening snap. The spectral analysis reveals a lower frequency spectrum ranging from approximately 30 Hz to 2000 Hz, indicative of reduced flow velocity and turbulence due to the stenotic tricuspid valve.\n\u2022 The Multi Disease (Class-MD) category presents a complex signal profile, incorporating features from multiple heart diseases. No consistent frequency range is observed for S1 and S2, with S1 spanning 20 to 150 Hz and S2 exceeding 200 Hz. The stronger presence of S2 and visible murmurs at various frequencies confirm the coexistence of multiple cardiovascular conditions."}, {"title": "VII.

The dimensional reduction and cluster identification for this dataset were analyzed using a t-SNE plot, facilitating the understanding of data separability and aiding in the identification of decision boundaries crucial for classification tasks.\nFig. 8 illustrates the t-SNE plot, which shows that the classes do not form distinctly separate clusters. The feature space represented by t-SNE reveals significant overlap between classes, with data points dispersed across the plot. However, loose clustering is observed for classes AS (blue) and AR (red), indicating that these classes may have more defined characteristics in the high-dimensional space.

BENCHMARKING AND EVALUATION", "content": "The primary model, illustrated in Figure 9, is designed to process two distinct inputs: Mel spectrograms derived from audio signals and metadata encoded as one-hot vectors representing posture and auscultation site information. The Mel spectrograms are passed through a series of four convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling layers. These layers sequentially apply filters with ReLU activation, effectively reducing spatial dimensions while extracting essential features. A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is then employed to condense the learned features by averaging each feature map across the entire spectrogram. The output is fed into a dense layer with 32 neurons, where ReLU activation is applied, and dropout is introduced to mitigate overfitting. Meanwhile, the metadata input is processed independently through a dense layer, also comprising 32 neurons. The outputs from both pathways are subsequently concatenated into a unified feature vector, which is further refined through an additional dense layer, followed by dropout. The final output layer, containing four neurons with sigmoid activation, is tailored for multi-label classification. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer, with binary cross-entropy as the loss function and binary accuracy serving as the evaluation metric.\nThe LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Bidirectional LSTM, and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models build upon this architecture by incorporating recurrent layers after the convolutional layers, as shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12 respectively. These recurrent layers are instrumental in capturing the temporal dependencies within heart sound sequences.\nThe LSTM model, depicted in Figure 10, is a specialized recurrent neural network that excels at modeling temporal sequences and long-range dependencies. By leveraging memory cells capable of retaining information over extended periods, LSTM networks effectively address the vanishing gradient problem often encountered in standard RNNs. This architecture proves particularly effective in tasks where the sequence and duration of events play a critical role in prediction or classification, enabling the model to capture patterns that unfold over time.\nIn the Bidirectional LSTM model, illustrated in Figure 11, the sequence data is processed through two stacked Bidirectional LSTM layers, each comprising 64 units, configured to output the entire sequence. This is followed by an attention mechanism, which assigns greater importance to significant features, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of the sequence. A global average pooling layer then reduces the sequence output to a single vector, which is combined with the processed metadata. As with the other models, the final output layer employs sigmoid activation to facilitate multi-class classification."}, {"title": "B.

Given the limited number of patients, the model was trained using individual audio recordings as input, with the auscultation site and patient position provided as secondary inputs. Only the four disease labels were used during training; the N label was omitted, as it was inferred through the absence of any disease label.\nThe model was trained using the Adam optimizer with binary crossentropy loss. The specific hyperparameters for the Adam optimizer are detailed in Table VI. Class weights were computed to address class imbalance, and early stopping and model checkpointing were utilized to prevent overfitting and to retain the best-performing model, respectively.\nGiven that the model was trained on individual audio recordings, an aggregation method was required to generate predictions at the patient level. For each patient, predictions were computed for all 8 recordings. The final prediction was determined by averaging the predictions across the 8 recordings and applying a threshold, optimized via brute-force to maximize the macro-averaged F1 score. This threshold was subsequently employed to generate predictions for the test set, enabling model evaluation."}, {"title": "C. Evaluation Procedure"}]}

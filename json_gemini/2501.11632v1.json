Since Google introduced the concept in 2012, KGs have been applied across various fields\u2014including e-commerce scientific research [1], and healthcare [2]. Their capacity for semantic integration and knowledge representation has made them particularly valuable tools for knowledge-intensive fields. Biomedical research generates vast amounts of complex data, spanning molecular interactions, pharmacological insights, and clinical records [3]. Traditional data management strategies, such as relational databases and rule-based systems, struggle to capture the intricate and interdependent nature of biological processes. As a result, valuable insights often remain fragmented, limiting their practical impact on research and healthcare decision-making.\nTo address these challenges, Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as a transformative approach. By integrating diverse data sources, BKGs enable more comprehensive representation and analysis of biomedical knowledge [4, 5]. This structured integration facilitates advanced applications such as disease modeling, drug discovery, and personalized medicine in ways that traditional approaches cannot easily support. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) [6] and multi-modal data integration [7], have significantly enhanced the development and utility of BKGs. Techniques such as graph representation learning and natural language processing have expanded the scope and impact of BKG applications, generating novel insights into disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development efforts.\nDespite the growing interest in BKGs, existing surveys often focus narrowly on specific domains or methodologies, overlooking the latest technological developments and emerging applications. For example, Nicholson et al. [8] review BKG construction methods, Zeng et al.'s [9] explore BKG applications in drug discovery, and Wu et al.'s [10] as well as Cui et al.'s [11] provide surveys of BKGs in healthcare. This survey aims to fill this gap by providing a holistic review, systematically introducing their development, methodologies, and implications for future biomedical research.\nIn this paper, we present a systematic survey of BKGs that span three central dimensions: domains, tasks, and applications (Figure 1). Our primary contributions are as follows:\n1) Domain-Focused Classification. We provide a detailed classification of BKGs based on their underlying data sources, ranging from multi-omics to pharmacology and clinical data, highlighting how these domains converge and diverge in practice.\n2) BKG Tasks Illustration. We examine the key tasks BKGs support, including knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation, emphasizing their foundational role in advancing biomedical research.\n3) Real-World Applications. We showcase the transformative potential of BKGs in precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research, illustrating their tangible impact across biomedical science and patient care.\n4) Emerging Trends and Future Directions. We analyze current limitations of BKGs, discuss the influence of recent technological breakthroughs (e.g., LLMs and multi-omics integration), and offer insights on how future developments might shape the field.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We begin with an overview of BKG definitions and construction workflows, laying the groundwork for understanding their development and utility. We then discuss the key domains contributing to BKG construction and application, followed by an analysis of core tasks. Next, we illustrate real-world applications, emphasizing the benefits of BKGs in biomedical research and clinical practice. We conclude with a discussion of different data sources, BKGs and tools. Current limitations, and future opportunities, providing a comprehensive outlook on this rapidly evolving field."}, {"title": "Background", "content": "A BKG is a structured framework designed to represent entities and their relationships within the biomedical domain [12]. Formally, a BKG is defined as $G = (E,R,F)$, where $E$ is the set of entities, $R$ is the set of relations, and $F\u2286 E\u00d7R\u00d7E$ is the set of factual triples. Each triple $(h,r,t) \u2208 F$ consists of a head entity $h\u2208 E$, a relation $r\u2208R$, and a tail entity $t\u2208 \u0395$, representing facts such as \u201cGene encodes Protein\u201d or \u201cDrug targets Disease.\"\nBKGs provide a semantic and structural foundation for integrating heterogeneous biomedical data, including genomic information, clinical records, and pharmacological properties. The use of standard vocabularies (e.g., Gene Ontology, SNOMED CT) ensures interoperability, while the graph structure facilitates reasoning and discovery. The graph can also be enriched with weights or probabilities $w: F \u2192 [0, 1]$ to capture the uncertainty or strength of relationships. For example, the plausibility of a triple $(h,r,t)$ can be evaluated using a scoring function $f_r(h, t)$, where higher values indicate greater confidence in the relationship.\nThe construction of a BKG is a multi-step process requiring careful design and validation to ensure the graph's quality, consistency, and applicability. The workflow includes data acquisition, preprocessing, relationship extraction, integration, and storage [13-15].\nBiomedical data are collected from a variety of sources, including structured databases $D_s$, semi-structured repositories $D_{ss}$, and unstructured text $D_{u}$, and other modalities, such as images and omics profiles. These datasets These datasets encompass molecular interactions, disease phenotypes, and drug properties. Preprocessing involves steps like noise reduction, normalization, and deduplication. Mathematically, given raw data $R$, the preprocessed data $D$ is obtained as: $D = \u03a6(R)$, where is a preprocessing pipeline consisting of normalization, mapping, and filtering functions.\nRelations $R$ are extracted using rule-based systems, machine learning models, or advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify semantic relationships [16-20]. The extracted relationships are represented as triples $(h,r,t)$, with a scoring function $f_r(h, t)$ quantifying their plausibility. The integration process aligns entities and relations across datasets using ontology matching and schema alignment. The final unified graph $G$ is constructed as:\n$G = U_{i=1}^{n}(E_i, R_i, F_i)$,\nwhere $(E_i, R_i, F_i)$ are the components of the i-th dataset.\nGraph consistency is ensured by enforcing integrity constraints, such as type compatibility for relations. For instance, a relation $r\u2208 R$ may require specific types for the head $h$ and tail $t$ entities, represented as $Type(h) \u2192 Type(t)$. The completed BKG is stored in graph databases $D_{BG}$, with support for querying using languages like SPARQL or Cypher.\nOnce constructed, BKGs require efficient representation methods to facilitate reasoning, querying, and downstream applications. Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods encode entities and relations into continuous vector spaces while preserving graph structure and semantics [4, 13, 21-23].\nTranslational models, such as TransE [24], TransH [25], TransD [26], and TransR [27], embed entities and relations into $R^d$ and enforce translational consistency:\n$h+r\u2248t$,\nwhere $h,r, t\u2208 R^d$ are the embeddings of head, tail, and relation, respectively. The plausibility of a triple is scored as:\n$f_r(h,t) = \u2212||h + r \u2013 t||_p$,\nwhere $||.||_p$ denotes the p-norm. Extensions like TransH project entities onto relation- specific hyperplanes, enhancing their ability to model diverse relation types.\nModels like DistMult [28], and RESCAL [29] decompose the adjacency tensor of the graph, uncovering intricate interaction patterns among entities and their relationships. These models evaluate the compatibility of $(h,r,t)$ based on semantic similarity. A common approach is the bilinear scoring function:\n$f_r(h,t) = h^T M_r t$,\nwhere $M_r \u2208 R^{d\u00d7d}$ is a relation-specific matrix. Models like DistMult simplify $M_r$ to a diagonal matrix, while RESCAL uses a full rank $M_r$ for greater flexibility.\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs), such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [30] or Graph Attention Networks (GATs) [31], leverage graph topology to learn context-aware embeddings by aggregating information from neighboring nodes in the graph. The hidden state of entity i at layer l + 1 is computed as:\n$h_i^{(l+1)} = \u03c3(\u03a3_{j\u2208 N_i}c_{i,j}Wh_j^l + b^l)$,\nwhere $N_i$ denotes the neighbors of $i$, $W^l$ is a learnable weight matrix, and $c_{i,j}$ is a normalization constant, and ois a non-linear activation function. This method captures both local and global graph structure, enabling complex reasoning.\nRecent advancements in KGE explore embeddings in hyperbolic and complex spaces. For instance, RotatE [32] models relations as rotations in a complex vector space:\n$t = h \u039f r$,\nwhere \u039f denotes the Hadamard product. These approaches are particularly effective for capturing hierarchical and cyclic patterns in biomedical data.\nIn many real-world scenarios, BKGs encompass not only graph structure but also multimodal data like images, omics profiles, or clinical variables [6, 31, 33-35]. Hybrid methods that fuse graph embeddings with these additional data streams can yield richer, more comprehensive representations [10, 36-40]. Heterogeneous network embeddings or meta-path analyses further extend this concept by accounting for diverse entity types and complex multi-step relationships [2, 10, 12, 22, 37, 41-44].\nBy summarizing the latent structure of the BKG, representation learning techniques enable powerful downstream applications, including link prediction (e.g., suggesting novel drug targets), node classification (e.g., categorizing diseases by etiology), and knowledge inference (e.g., identifying potential molecular pathways) [4, 10, 12, 37, 45-47]. Integrating with large language models and multimodal data holds promise for future innovation, potentially accelerating discovery and clinical translation in personalized medicine [6, 14, 48-51]."}, {"title": "Domains", "content": "BKGs serve as comprehensive frameworks that integrate diverse healthcare-related information across various interconnected domains. They provide a structured approach to organize multidisciplinary knowledge in biomedical sciences, encompassing fields such as genomics, drug discovery, and clinical data. By unifying these domains, BKGs support advanced analyses and facilitate interdisciplinary research.\nIn this section, BKGs are classified into three primary domains: multi-omics, pharmacology, and medical. They can be illustrated as overlapping sets (Figure 2a), with non-overlapping regions representing domain-specific tasks and intersecting areas reflecting interdisciplinary collaboration. The intersection of all three domains constitutes a multi-domain BKG, capturing the complex interdependencies within the biomedical field.\nMulti-omics BKGs integrate one or more omics data types to enable comprehensive biological analysis and the discovery of novel associations among biological entities. These BKGs focus on three primary areas: genome [52, 53], transcriptome [54-58], and proteome [58-63]. Recent advancements have also led to the development of multi-omics BKGs related to metabolomics [64] and epigenomics [52].\nGenome-centric BKGs model relationships between genomic entities to investigate disease mechanisms and biological pathways. For example, Feng et al. constructed a genome BKG that enables genomic information retrieval, including positional relationships between genomic regions and specific entities [52]. Jha et al. proposed GenomicsKG, a poly-omics BKG focusing on cancer genomics, which illustrates cancer evolution mechanisms and highlights gene roles and mutation frequencies [53].\nThe transcriptome includes all RNA molecules transcribed from the genome, including both coding and non-coding RNAs. Transcriptomic BKGs tackle the challenges of RNA diversity by integrating RNA-related data. Cavalleri et al. developed RNA-KG which supports the study of RNA interactions and pathophysiological processes such as miRNA-lncRNA associations [54]. Similarly, Liu et al. utilized transcriptomic data to build a BKG for studying Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, identifying pathogenesis similarities across subtypes [55].\nProtein-centric BKGs focus on understanding protein structure, function, and interactions. Zhang et al. introduced ProteinKG25, a BKG supporting protein representation pre-training based on Gene Ontology [59]. Binder et al. created an Alzheimer-specific protein BKG to predict disease-protein associations [60]. Similarly, Papadopoulos et al. developed IDP-KG to study intrinsically disordered proteins involved in cell signaling [61]. In addition, Nov\u00e1\u010dek et al. proposed a KG from phosphorylation data to predict kinase-substrate relationships [62].\nPharmacology is the study of drugs and medications, focusing on the interactions between drugs and biological system. The pharmacological domain of BKG comprises two main areas: pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics [36, 41, 65-74], and toxicology [39, 75-79]. The domain of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics interprets the relationship between drug dosage and its response [80], while the toxicology domain reveals mechanisms of adverse drug effects (ADRs) occurring in the body.\nPharmacodynamics examines drug effects on the body, whereas pharmacokinetics studies how the body processes drugs. BKGs in this area model drug-disease associations (DDAs) and drug- target interactions (DTIs) [4, 9]. For instance, Tanaka et al. developed IPM-KG to predict drug pathways [65]; Gonzalez-Cavazos et al. constructed DrugMechDB to promote the understanding between drugs and diseases [66]. Zhang et al. utilized COVID-19-specific BKGs to identify potential treatments through literature-based discovery (LBD) [67]. Similarly, Geleta et al. [68] and Gao et al. [69] constructed drug KGs to discover existing drugs for new diseases by identifying new targets. Additionally, the OREGANO KG proposed by Boudin et al. [70] incorporates natural compounds such as herbs and plant remedies into a BKG aimed for drug repurposing. Therefore, the structured drug information represented in BKG can be considered as an integration of DDA and DTI networks. Aside from that, datasets related to the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs are collected for pharmacokinetics usage. Chen et al. developed a transporter proteins KG to enhance drug discovery process from a pharmacokinetics perspective [71].\nToxicology-focused BKGs model adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) [4, 9]. Abdelaziz et al. proposed a DDI prediction framework, by utilizing a drug BKG where toxicogenomic datasets were integrated into a BKG, generating features such as side effect-based similarity measures [75]. Furthermore, M. Bean et al. developed a BKG to compile adverse reaction datasets for ADR prediction, ensuring patient safety. Talukder et al. mined drug indications and contradictions from public repositories and compiled it into a drug interaction KG [77]; whereas Faruggia et al. integrated drug-related concepts such as drugs, side effects and DDIs into a BKG to distinguish interacting and non-interacting drug pairs [39].\nThe medical domain integrates healthcare-related information, including prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. Medical BKGs typically focus on two areas: medical knowledge [33, 81-89] and clinical data [31, 33, 82, 83, 87, 90-93]. Medical knowledge includes medical theories and terminologies, while clinical data consists of real-world data such as patient registries and diagnosis reports. These data can be compiled into medical BKGs as entities and relations, linking patients with similar conditions.\nMedical knowledge encompasses information such as medical concepts, terminologies, and theories that are primarily gathered from medical knowledge databases and scientific publications [10]. Huang et al. developed a medical KG by standardizing medical instructions related to drug responses and disease complications, facilitating the retrieval of medical entities with specific keywords [81]. Shang et al. introduced a clinical KG enriched with domain- specific ontologies, designed for integration with patient information models [82]. Similarly, Gong et al. constructed a KG which linked medical entities with electronic medical record (EMR) datasets, enabling accurate predictions of associations between patients and medications [83]. Moreover, disease-specific KGs further specialize in capturing knowledge about particular illnesses. Zhu et al. created SDKG-11, featuring curated data on 11 diseases from biomedical literature and databases, supporting the discovery of novel insights by visualizing disease-specific patterns and relationships [84]. Li et al. prioritized hepatocellular carcinoma [85], while Huang et al. focused on depression [86], both utilizing extensive datasets to offer deep insights into these diseases.\nClinical data consist of real-world patient information critical for diagnostics, treatment planning, and healthcare decision-making. These data are often stored in standardized systems such as EMRs and electronic health records (EHRs). Clinical data in BKGs can be classified into patient registries [31, 82, 83, 87, 90-92], laboratory results [82, 93], and medical images [31, 33].\nPatient registries collect comprehensive data about patients, including personal details, symptoms, diagnosis results, and treatment outcomes. Rotmensch et al. extracted disease, symptom and personal attributes such as sex and weight from EMRs to construct a health KG for precise predictions [90]. Zheng et al. proposed a multi-modal KG integrating doctor-patient dialogues to capture a patient's medical history [31]; while Zhen et al. developed a clinical trials KG representing trials, conditions, and outcomes [91]. Laboratory test data provide objective health indicators essential for identifying and monitoring medical conditions. Wang et al. constructed a diabetes KG which combined test results and lifestyle evidence to identify risk factors and predict health outcomes [93]. Shang et al. extended this concept by developing an EHR-oriented KG where test results are organized as nodes, assisting in disease diagnosis through standardized data integration [82]. Furthermore, Medical imaging data, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), X-rays, and CT scans, are valuable for enriching BKGs with diagnostic insights. Gao et al. organized ophthalmic medical images and corresponding reports into a KG, creating a centralized system for managing ophthalmology records [33]. This multi- modal KG connects individual medical records via shared attributes such as gender and medical history. Zheng et al. further enhanced this approach by integrating chest X-rays, ultrasounds, and CT scans with doctor-patient dialogues into a COVID-19 KG, linking radiological findings with textual data to improve interpretation [31].\nMulti-domain BKGs represent the intersection of the multi-omics, pharmacology, and medical domains, integrating datasets from one or more of these areas. These overlapping regions capture the interconnected nature of biomedical science, providing a comprehensive representation of biological interactions and supporting cross-disciplinary research. By unifying diverse datasets, multi-domain BKGs enable the modeling of complex interrelationships across the biomedical field.\nIn the omics-medical domain, Santos et al. developed the CKG, which combines clinical and molecular proteomic data to interpret disease phenotypes and identify protein biomarkers [1]. Similarly, Renaux et al. curated genetic and clinical datasets to construct BOCK for oligogenic diseases, integrating disease information and biological networks to predict pathogenic gene interactions [94]. Next, BKGs in the omics-pharmacology domain merge omics and drug datasets to explore alternative treatments. Gao et al. proposed a BKG for drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction, integrating protein-drug triples from medical documents and leveraging protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to uncover novel DDIs [95]. In the pharmacology-medical domain, BKGs emphasize the integration of drug and disease information to support treatment recommendations. Huang et al. introduced a COVID-19 BKG featuring drug-disease associations (DDAs) and disease-chemical interactions, aiding therapeutic development [96]. Additionally, BKGs that span all three domains - multi-omics, pharmacology, and medical, are considered the most comprehensive BKGs, encompassing the full spectrum of biomedical sciences [97-100]. Notable examples include PharmKG by Zheng et al., which harmonizes gene, drug, and disease information [97]; and TarKG by Zhou et al., which improves access to heterogeneous biomedical datasets [98].\nApart from that, a multi-domain BKG can be further classified into two types [45, 84]: general BKG [97-100] and specific BKG [38, 55, 67, 74, 84-86, 93, 96, 101, 102]. Both types are compiled from multi-domain datasets, but they differ in scope and purpose (Figure 2b). General BKGs are constructed from a wide array of datasets, encompassing a broad spectrum of biological data. They are model complex biological interactions, providing a comprehensive view of the biological system. Examples of general BKGs include Hetionet [99] and PharmKG [97], both of which incorporate entities such as genes, drugs, and diseases, to support various biomedical research applications. Specific BKGs focus on narrower topics, such as particular diseases or biological pathways, using targeted datasets. They are subsets of general BKGs and are typically smaller in scale, enabling detailed exploration of specialized topics. For instance, Zhu et al. developed a BKG for rare diseases, facilitating the discovery of orphan drugs [101]. Huang et al. created a Kawasaki disease BKG [102], and Nian et al. proposed a BKG for Alzheimer's disease [74]. Disease-specific BKGs have also been applied to COVID-19 research, aiding treatment and drug development efforts [38, 67, 96].\nWhile general BKGs provide a versatile foundation for broad biomedical research, specific BKGs offer focused insights into particular areas of interest, making them valuable for both hypothesis generation and targeted investigations."}, {"title": "Tasks", "content": "BKG enables diverse biomedical applications through multiple essential tasks that serve as the functional components of its application system.

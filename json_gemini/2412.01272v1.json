{"title": "Uncertainty-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Gear Fault Diagnosis in Motor Drives", "authors": ["Subham Sahoo", "Huai Wang", "Frede Blaabjerg"], "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data and unseen fault scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Models developed using deep learning are widely used in all types of inference and decision making in the field of power electronics [1]. In other words, it is becoming increasingly important to assess the reliability and effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) models before putting them into practice. This is because the predictions of AI are usually affected by noise and model output errors, leading to unexplainable results [2].\nSources of uncertainty arise when the test and training data are mismatched, while data uncertainty occurs because of class overlap or due to the presence of noise in the data; however, estimating knowledge uncertainty is significantly more difficult than estimating data uncertainty. These uncertain behavior can be documented into two categories, namely aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty."}, {"title": "A. Classification of uncertainties in AI", "content": "By definition, the irreducible inconsistency in data that gives rise to uncertainty in predictions is called as aleatoric uncertainty (also known as data uncertainty). This type of uncertainty is not a property of the model, but rather is an inherent property of the data distribution, which makes it irreducible.\nIn contrast, epistemic uncertainty (also known as knowledge uncertainty) occurs due to inadequate knowledge. One can define models to answer different questions in model-based prediction. Even in scenarios when the data is sufficient, there may be massive collections of data that are information-poor from a semantic perspective. In such cases, although AI-based methods are usually referred to characterize the emergent features of the data. However, since the data in hand can be rather incomplete, noisy, discordant, the predictions are not always accurate."}, {"title": "B. Key reasons behind uncertainties", "content": "Limited data: Going beyond limited training to have an highly accurate ensemble model, there are many practical scenarios which does not invoke more data because of the risks. One such example for power electronic applications is fault based scenarios. Since fault data is limited and risky to be emulated in the lab, NNs can easily provide overconfident decisions when trained over limited set of data.\nUnseen data/scenarios: Current studies assume prior knowledge of the connection between the training data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Such implicit assumptions may not be reliable and even unavailable in safety-critical applications. Furthermore, these studies focus on frequentist deep learning models that represent the network parameters as deterministic values and deliver a point-estimate prediction that is often overconfident. This may lead to unreliable judgments and cause consequences for safety-critical assets.\nThis gap has been illustrated in Fig. 2, which highlights the training data as the independent identically distributed"}, {"title": "C. Literature survey", "content": "Unexpected mechanical faults of machines frequently occur during operation, posing a significant risk. Consequently, it is of high relevance to develop fault diagnosis and health management technologies for real-time surveillance of machine health condition [3], [4]. This process is also known as intelligent fault diagnosis, since the established model can automatically identify the machine faults and set an alarm for manual intervention. Intensive research on the advanced signal processing approaches, such as wavelet analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and sparse coding, has been conducted to extract the fault-sensitive features, such as the bearing fault feature frequency and gear mesh frequency [5]- [6]. These approaches can take advantage of the physical infor-"}, {"title": "D. Main contributions", "content": "Based on the issues discussed above, this paper exploits uncertainty-aware Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and its effectiveness for fault diagnosis of gear box faults emulated on a fault simulator. A preliminary case study has been thoroughly covered in [13] using point-estimate neural networks, which only generalizes the decisions based on accuracy without any explainability measures. Some of the key features of BNN that favor in minimizing the uncertainty of predictions for power electronics are:\n\u2022 Probabilistic outputs: BNNs provide probabilistic outputs rather than point estimates.

Challenges with current diagnostic approaches", "content": "Considering a simple comparative example of extrinsic sensor data on surface faults against the datasets representing no fault (see Fig. 5), it can be seen that there is no visible statistical difference for torque or DC voltage profile, since the distribution shifts on the application of load. This could potentially be due to the lack of further application of filters or little understanding of how the parameters interact with each other. As explained before, this affects the decisions taken by AI, which is primarily driven by these statistical attributes."}, {"title": "III.

BNNs and BDL are robust to over-fitting problems and can be trained on both small and large datasets."}, {"title": "A. Theory", "content": "Before discussing Bayesian modeling principles, let us start with the preliminaries of a simple feed forward neural network (NN) to understand uncertainty modeling in detail.\nFirst, the structure of a single-hidden-layer neural network (NN) [15] is presented, and then extended to the case of multiple layers. Let x be a D-dimensional input vector; we use a linear map $W_1$ and a bias b to transform x into a vector of Qelements, i.e., $W_1x + b$. Next, a nonlinear transfer function $\\sigma(.)$, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU), can be applied to obtain the output of the hidden layer. Then, another linear function $W_2$ can be used to map the hidden layer to the output:\n$\\hat{y} = \\sigma(W_1x + b)W_2$.", "latex": ["\\hat{y} = \\sigma(W_1x + b)W_2"]}, {"title": "B.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION", "content": "This section examines the performance of our proposed method from two aspects: a comparable performance with the traditional diagnosis in handling seen domain; and a unique capability in recognizing unseen domains. The model specifications of the designed BNN is shown in Fig. 5(b). To provide a comparative evaluation, we have considered three candidates for data-driven classification: BNN, CNN and ResNet. It is observed that all three models achieve high- accuracy results in diagnosing seen domain for the extrinsic sensors that can be seen in Fig. 6. The diagnostic accuracies of CNN, ResNet and probabilistic BNN are 98.8%, 98% and 98.5%, respectively. This implies that our proposed method also per- forms satisfactorily in diagnosing faults within the seen domain. On the other hand, when dealing with unseen fault, CNN and ResNet undoubtedly give incorrect results, since the unseen gear fault is not used to develop the trained models. This highlights the necessity and advantages of our proposed probabilistic BNN. In this context, we discuss the our proposed method by an illustrative example, total uncertainty analysis and uncertainty decomposition."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "In conclusion, this paper delves into the application of uncertainty-aware AI algorithms for fault diagnosis of gear faults, with a particular focus on Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Through the utilization of BNNs, we have effectively quantified uncertainties in predictions, providing probabilistic outputs that offer valuable insights into the reliability of diagnostic assessments. We have carried out rigorous test cases by considering different subsets of faults as the training data and identifying reasonable answers from BNN for the unseen faults in a structural way. The effect of noise variance, model parameters and unseen data has been covered in detail with key results based on theoretical foundations. This provides us with a formidable framework for a multi-dimensional decision making process (see Fig. 9) that requires human intervention before finalizing the data-driven algorithm for fault diagnosis of power electronics. This enhances a qualitative assessment of predictions from AI that often goes overlooked due to high accuracy as the sole decision metric. As a follow-up, the decision making process will ascertain corrective actions across the input stage such that further data analysis can be carried out."}]}

Drawing on sociologist Howard Becker's concept of Art Worlds, this method expands the scope of traditional AI and creativity evaluations beyond benchmarks, user studies with crowd-workers, or focus groups conducted with artists. Our method involves two mutually informed dialogues: 1) 'dialogues with art worlds,' placing artists in conversation with experts such as art historians, curators, and archivists, and 2) 'dialogues with the machine,' facilitated through structured artist- and critic-led experimentation with state-of-the-art generative AI tools. We demonstrate the value of this method through a case study with artists and experts steeped in non-western art worlds, specifically the Persian Gulf. We trace how these dialogues help create culturally rich and situated forms of evaluation for representational possibilities of generative AI that mimic the reception of generative artwork in the broader art ecosystem. They also allow artists to shift their use of the tools to respond to their cultural and creative context. Our study can provide generative AI researchers an understanding of complex dynamics of technology, creativity and the socio-politics of art worlds, to build more inclusive machines for diverse art worlds.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In his seminal work Art Worlds, sociologist Howard Becker emphasized the fundamentally collabora-tive nature of art creation [1]. Instead of focusing on a singular, isolated genius or on the aesthetic output, he argued for the study of an 'art world' \u2013 the network of critics, curators, suppliers, adminis-trators, and audiences who shape artistic activity. The study of art in this conception should not be isolated to artistic outputs, but also encompass the social processes that make art production possible. Said differently, we should study what artists do and how they do it, not just artistic symbolism or composition. Art production in this view is an inherently social process, not an individual or technical one. This scholarship changed the way art was studied [2].\nAs generative AI is integrated into the artistic domain, it also enters into existing art worlds and creates the possibility of shaping its own art worlds [3]. Applying Becker's perspective to generative AI, the existing evaluation paradigm of AI for creativity must necessarily become 'social' and thus"}, {"title": "2 Dialogue as Method", "content": "In this section we introduce two mutually informed sets of dialogue: dialogue with art worlds and dialogue with machines. Throughout this section, we motivate the value of each dialogue and then describe our approach to instantiating the dialogue within our case study situated within the cultural context of the Persian Gulf."}, {"title": "2.1 Dialogue with Art Worlds: Evaluating Creativity as an Ecosystem", "content": "According to Martin Zeilinger, human creativity is \"dialogic, relational, and fundamentally intertex-tual\" \u2013 a social act [31]. One of the lessons of art history is that art was not developed in vacuum, but has been a dialogue between creator, receivers, audience, about symbols, processes and interpretation [1, 32, 33]. Then, evaluations of art are also necessarily social. We propose a method that allows us to engage the creative ecosystem to understand the impacts of AI in art production. By engaging experts in existing art worlds, we aim to expand the idea of who can evaluate generative AI, arguing that these evaluations should not just be the remit of AI researchers or of atomic communities of artists."}, {"title": "2.2 Dialogue with Machines: Structured Artistic Experimentation with Generative AI Tools", "content": "Al researchers have called for an investigation into \u201chow the novel AI technologies are used in everyday creative processes\u201d [11] which can shift AI towards \u201cmore diverse forms of visual art collaboration and assistance\" [12]. Creating room for free form experimentation by artists during our study allows us to mimic real world use similarly to workshops done in [18]. However, one key difference in our study is that experimentation with the machine is informed by the dialogue with the commentators, to mimic the reception of generated art in the art world.\nWithin our study, artists participated in a multi-week experimental study where they used generative AI tools to produce culturally situated media artifacts that tell stories of their own identities that have traditionally not been represented in dominant media. Artists were free to use any model\u00b9, technique, and dataset they wanted. Ideas for what they explored and created during this period were informed by the dialogue with commentators in the first workshop, and shaped through periodic meetings with commentators throughout the experimentation period. Artists were encouraged to experiment with prompt engineering and fine-tuning as approaches to steer models towards their desired representations. Artists documented and shared their process and experience in a series of process logs and reflection videos.\nThis method allows us to study not just artistic outputs but also processes of artistic production. The study of such processes is significant in extending the artists' use of generative AI tools beyond the final artistic product, and also its impacts on the way they produce things. The process is as important in art as the output. Knowing about creative processes can also help us identify gaps in design, interface, interactions of generative AI systems and thus present developers with actionable pathways for improving generative AI as a tool for cultural representation. Moreover, having this process be informed by collective reflections also helps us see how far artists can push existing tools for more radical possibilities. This means insights and recommendations that emerge from this mutually informed dialogue do not just improve the interface of the technology but also its possibilities of use in different cultural contexts and use cases."}, {"title": "3 Case Study: Art Worlds of the Persian Gulf", "content": "We focused our project on artists from a similar cultural background since we were interested in fostering a dialogue on generative AI as a tool for cultural representation. All artists and expert commentators had expertise in the Islamic worlds broadly and the Persian gulf specifically."}, {"title": "3.0.1 Participant recruitment", "content": "We recruited three artists and three commentators through personal networks of professional col-laboration. Prior work with art worlds [14] had helped us build connections that we leveraged for a snowball sampling of artists who both 1) had some experience with digital computational tools for creativity in their artistic practice and 2) identified with the Persian Gulf region (either through lived experience, heritage, or through their work). We similarly recruited art commentators who had expertise on the art world and social histories in the Persian Gulf.\nThe artists' expertise include graphical art, video, sculpture, architecture and design, and their work has been exhibited, among others, at Saatchi or Christie's galleries, at the Venice Biennale or at Centre Pompidou. The commentators hold positions at universities in the US and museums in the UK similar to the British Museum, Tate and V&A. All commentators and artists were deeply immersed in the art worlds of the Persian Gulf. Two artists were Iranian with extensive history of making art representing Iranian contexts, one artist was of Armenian descent (a minority group within Iran) and a landscape scholar, one commentator was an expert in Iranian art history and media, one commentator had training in the architecture and history of Islamic worlds and one commentator was the Iran curator at a major global museum in the UK. This sampling ensured contextually focused conversations.\nThe artists' and commentators' names are withheld for privacy. Throughout the following subsections we refer to artists with a numeric participant identifier (e.g. Artist-1, Artist-2, and Artist-3). We refer to commentators based on their expertise (e.g. Art Historian, Architectural Historian, Curator)."}, {"title": "3.1 Tracing the Benefit of Dialogues", "content": "In this section we present evidence of the utility of this method for technology developers by tracing two dialogues that i) distill decentralized datasets as a pathway for improved cultural representa-tion (Dialogue A) and ii) surface possibilities for culturally situated generative AI use-cases within creative domains (Dialogue B). Coupling the the artists' experimentation with the dialogues with commentators allowed us to interrogate and understand what culturally situated creativity is possible through the current technological state, and what interventions might be needed to give more agency to non-western artists. The collective conversation particularly helped us learn from histories of past technologies intervening in artistic practice, to gain an understanding of how we can analyze genera-tive AI as a technology of artistic practice. These dialogues also allowed artists and commentators to collectively develop visions for generative AI through their experimentation, practice, and discussion that were suitable to the art worlds they were part of and attuned to the different processes of the artists."}, {"title": "3.1.1 Dialogue A: Aspirations for decentralized datasets", "content": "We present a dialogue where multiple artists developed a specific pathway towards more culturally situated generative AI: building decentralized datasets. We present the multiple dialogues between the artists and commentators and artists and machines, through which artists iteratively added layers of specificity for this pathway.\nOne exchange that led to this aspiration was between Artist-3 and the Museum Curator, discussing the limitations of existing datasets for female Iranian representation such as Qajar\u00b2 paintings or museum datasets. To address these limitations, Artist-3 developed an innovative approach by creating three distinct AI models, each drawing from different cultural sources. The first model utilized Instagram photos to capture contemporary representations of Iranian women, reflecting the modern digital landscape. This approach prompted the Museum Curator and Artist-3 to collectively explore the exclusions embedded in social media platforms, which may reflect certain normative standards.

We show how investigating, through dialogue, the historical context of an artwork, the intention of the artist, and their knowledge about the cultural context within which they are working offers a new lens into the art itself and can even push the artist to think deeper about their work.\nThis exchange began with a discussion between one artist and the commentators in workshop 1, that ultimately shifted the artist's project idea for the experimentation period. Artist-2 was struck by two highly divergent understandings of Persianness articulated by two different commentators. The first focused on a historical outsider's view of Persianness, framed through \"the Western Cultural imaginary... through certain kinds of artifacts, through a particular period in history\u201d (Museum Curator). The second offered an \u201con the ground\" understanding of Persianness defined by \u201ceveryday life through everyday forms of resistance\u201d (Art Historian). Inspired by this, Artist-2 used their project to push against the fixity of definitions that AI might produce to shape a particular idea of Persianness. They explored this idea using generative AI to create what they referred to as \u201chybridized\" imagery"}, {"title": "4 Discussion and Takeaways", "content": "The dialogic method we propose allows us to evaluate Al's role within a culturally-situated ecosystem of creativity in a particular context. We were able to understand elements of generative AI's outputs which would be evaluated within their reception in the art world. Our approach also recognizes that there are more impacted communities in this ecosystem that have essential expertise for appropriate evaluation of models within particular cultural context and use cases. By elevating their expertise we follow other forms of community-centered evaluations of AI [14, 34\u201336] and add to existing methods for evaluating the complex interplay between technology, creativity and socio-politics of the art world. Such holisitic engagement can offer metrics for AI creativity tools that are more relevant to the non-western world, fostering a more nuanced discourse on the role of AI in creative processes.\nOur dialogic approach surfaces design pathways that are attuned to the broader socio-political ecosys-tem of creativity and culture and can help build tools which could live up to art's representational and social potentials, especially in non-western contexts. We did not have space to dive into the aspirations and recommendations that emerged from this study, which will be published separately as a full paper. Nonetheless, we offered up examples of mutually-informed dialogues between artists, commentators, and machines to showcase how this approach shifted artists' use of the tools to test for more radical possibilities rooted in their cultural context and how they developed pathways that could drive the development of culturally relevant and meaningful tools for non-western artists."}]}

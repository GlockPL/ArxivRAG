The impact of AI is increasingly felt across\nmusic making from creation and production, protection, distribution, to consumption. Al systems for high quality\nmusic generation and production exist in research labs and online, e.g. Magenta\u00b9 powered by Tensorflow (Google) and\nSuno AI\u00b2. However, these systems typically rely on extremely large musical datasets to train the AI models which\nbiases the models to genres captured in large datasets and creates barriers to generating music beyond the dominant\nmusical genre datasets such as Western Classical music or pop music [2, 3]. For example, it is not possible to train these\nmodels on many minority culture genres such as Qin genre in China nor contemporary subcultures such as glitch or\nalgorithmic music as the datasets are simply too small or non-existent. Whilst recent advances in Al research have\nstarted to explore low-resource AI approaches [5, 6] which have the potential to make small datasets usable in deep\nlearning generative models they are currently difficult for musicians understand and use. The combination of these\nfactors means that the rapid increase in the use of AI within the music ecosystem not only creates barriers to using\nsmall datasets and marginalised genres with Al but also that AI increasingly marginalises genres of music that are\nalready underrepresented or not represented at all in large datasets of music.\nTo begin to address this gap this paper reports on a four month international research project\u00b3 which explored\neXplainable AI (XAI) [4] and broader Human-Centred AI (HCAI) [7] and Responsible AI (RAI) challenges and oppor-\ntunities of using small datasets with Al music generation. We take a broad view of XAI and include explanations of\nAI bias, trust, training, datasets, control, and transparency. In doing so the project asked how we make AI models for\nmusic more ethical, less biased, and more understandable and usable by people - musicians in our research.\nThe project focused on AI and music in the UK and China as the Creative Industries and Intangible Cultural Heritages\nof the UK and China provide a rich ecosystem of AI research along with substantial cultural heritage beyond the\ndominant forms typically used in current music Al research.\nOur research question is: What are the explainable AI challenges and opportunities for using small datasets of\nmusic with AI?"}, {"title": "2 DATA COLLECTION", "content": "To understand the XAI challenges of using small datatsets with Al music models we undertook interviews with seven\ninternational experts. We then held a hybrid workshop between the UK and China hosted at the Institute of Data and\nIntelligent Innovation Design, Academy of Arts and Design, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in Jan 2024 (Fig 1).\nThirty-seven participants were brought together to build a community to share knowledge, experience, and practice\naround using AI with marginalised music. The workshop included brainstorming about challenges and opportunities,\nand case study sharing. We also commissioned a new piece of music composed using the Chinese Musical Instrument\nDatabase and RAVE AI5 to foreground the practical challenges of undertaking such creative endeavours."}, {"title": "3 RESULTS", "content": "The interviews and workshop discussions were video recorded and transcribed and then analysed using Thematic\nAnalysis [1] to identify challenges and opportunities for UK-China collaboration in this area. Four themes were identified\nas outlined below followed by the identified challenges and opportunities.\nTheme 1: Access to AI-enabled Music Exploration. Barriers that hinder the widespread utilization of AI in\nmusic exploration with marginalised music genres included: Ethical & economic constraints such as ethical data"}, {"title": "4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "content": "Regardless of the nature of the marginalised music genre, they all suffer from increased marginalisation by deep learning\nAI. In addition to the lack of existing large datasets of marginalised music genres there many features of these genres\nwhich are simply difficult to encode into forms of representation that might be used in deep learning model training\nsuch as MIDI. Moreover, many of these genres are shared, learnt, and passed from generation to generation through\noral tradition rather than being written down which again makes them less amenable to use with Al models than music\ngenres which are well described and documented by conventional musical notations and encoding.\nThe Key Take Away from our analysis is that one AI model or architecture will not be able to handle the wide\nvariety of music styles, genres, heritage, cultural contexts, and forms of notation and documentation. This challenges\nthe dominant contemporary discourse on the wide application and general use of deep learning models such as large\nlanguage models and catalyses opportunities for collaboration. From the analysis of workshops and interviews we\nidentified opportunities for collaboration between the UK and China on reducing barriers to the use of marginalised\nmusic with Al including: 1) New techniques for dataset building which relies on XAI to understand the training\nconstraints of AI models; 2) New approaches to AI model training requiring XAI to explain how the training works;\n3) Sharing examples of small dataset use which needs XAI to explain how the AI model is trained and used; 4)\nInterdisciplinary collaborations; 5) Community and stakeholder engagement. To bring together XAI resources for the\nuse of marginalised music with Al we suggest building an online repository to include:\n\u2022 Descriptions of a variety of musical genres including rich descriptions of the genre, the associated musical\ntraditions, musical notations (if any), musical practices and conventions, and the cultural context of the genres.\n\u2022 Musical content and corpora for the music genres. For example, in the style the Dunya project which includes\naudio recordings and descriptions of the recordings and cultural context as well as related software tools.\n\u2022 XAI descriptions of the suitability of AI architectures, models, and settings for the genres in the repository.\n\u2022 Explanations of Al fine-tuning and style transfer opportunities between pre-trained deep AI models and the AI\nmodels and genres in the repository.\nThe key XAI value add of the repository will be the explanations of interconnections between the parts of the\nrepository. For example, XAI mapping between musical content, suitable AI models, and fine-tuning and style transfer\nopportunities. Finally, participants in this project emphasised that whilst it is hard to work with marginalised music\nand AI, such approaches strengthen cultural representation of underrepresented cultures and contribute to addressing\nissues of bias of deep learning models. We believe that taking an XAI approach to developing low-resource models and\ntraining mechanisms will offer more opportunities for musicians to engage with and use Al in their music making\npractices with small datasets of marginalised music. We hope that this would help to increase representation of\nunderrepresented genres in the Al music ecosystem. We are now building on this project to bring together a global\nInternational Responsible AI Music community and invite people to join our network."}]}

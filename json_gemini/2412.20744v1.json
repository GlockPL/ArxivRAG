Early and accurate detection of PD progression is vital for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Current diagnostic methods, however, are often costly, time-consuming, and require specialized equipment and expertise. This work proposes an innovative approach to predicting PD progression using regression methods, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (\u039a\u0391\u039d).

Accurate prediction of PD progression is vital for timely intervention and effective disease management. Time series forecasting in this context involves predicting future disease states based on historical clinical and physiological data, making it an indispensable tool for clinical decision-making.\n\nTraditional approaches to forecasting PD progression have primarily relied on parametric models grounded in domain-specific knowledge, such as autoregressive (AR) models, exponential smoothing, and structural time series models. These methods, while effective in certain scenarios, often fall short in capturing the complex, nonlinear dynamics inherent in PD progression dataset. Additionally, traditional methods have integrated combination of regression techniques with deep learning models to enhance longitudinal forecasting accuracy. Techniques such as combining regression models with neural networks have been explored to leverage the strengths of both approaches, but they often struggle with scalability and interpretability.\n\nThe advent of machine learning (ML) has revolutionized time series forecasting by enabling the analysis of large datasets and uncovering intricate, nonlinear relationships that traditional models may overlook. In particular, ML models focused on PD classification have demonstrated remarkable success due to their flexibility and adaptability. Subsequently, more sophisticated architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), were developed to address the limitations of traditional recurrent networks, such as the vanishing gradient problem. Additionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their proficiency in spatial pattern recognition, have been employed in conjunction with LSTMs to efficiently process both spatial and temporal dependencies, thereby enhancing forecasting accuracy.\n\nDespite their advancements, many DL models, face challenges related to scalability and interpretability. The number of parameters in these networks often grows non-linearly with the addition of layers, complicating their implementation and understanding. Otherwise, they just classify the type of Parkinson instead of specifying how much progression happened.\n\nA new neural network design called Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) has emerged as a potential game changer. KANs, which are inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, use spline-based univariate functions that are constructed as learnable activation functions instead of standard linear weights. This novel design improves the network's accuracy and interpretability, allowing it to obtain equivalent or greater outcomes with smaller network sizes across a variety of applications.\n\nThe present study looks at the use of KANs to forecast longitudinal datasets of Parkinson's disease progression, an area that has not been well studied in the literature. We intend to assess the usefulness of KANs in real-world clinical scenarios, examining their efficiency in terms of the number of trainable parameters and exploring how their additional degrees of freedom may affect forecasting ability. Using real-world clinical data, we evaluate the performance of KANs with classic regression models and advanced DL architectures such as LSTMs and other regression approaches to determine the most effective way to predict Parkinson's disease development. This study aims to verify KANS as a versatile tool in advanced neural network design for clinical time series forecasting, although more research is needed to maximize their use in broader applications.\n\nMajor contributions of this research are given below :\n\nThe study introduces the use of Kalmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to analyze AMP MDS UPDRS datasets, demonstrating exceptional performance in capturing the longitudinal progression of Parkinson's disease and marks the first use of KAN for predicting disease progression in this specific context, showcasing its ability to effectively model and interpret complex temporal patterns in clinical data."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "To address the objective of parkinson progression based on MDS UPDRS score, the study provides a comprehensive methodology consisting of several key steps. First, dataset description is there, then work on our model starting with data preprocessing, extraction of features from a given dataset, the detailed working of different types of models used and finally, a description of model parameters.\n\nThe dataset used in this research focuses on predicting Parkinson's disease progression. It contains data from 248 patients who underwent regular Cerebrospinal Fluid Mass Spectrometry (CSF-MS) tests and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores at multiple time points (0, 6, 12, and 24 months). This time-series data is of longitudinal nature and allows us to use Deep learning techniques like LSTM or KAN to predict future MDS-UPDRS scores.\n\nThe core of the dataset is protein abundance information derived from CSF samples analyzed using mass spectrometry. Each patient contributed multiple samples over several years, with corresponding MDS-UPDRS assessments performed to gauge Parkinson's disease severity at each time point. The MDS-UPDRS score which represents the motor symptoms and clinometric characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) on a scale, is one of the dataset's\n\n\nThe data was explored using Python Jupyter notebook, a report was created to understand the dataset more deeply with the help of Pandas and Numpy Library. The dataset consisted of 3 types, categorical values for UniProt, Peptide, visit id and upd23b clinical state on medication, integer values for patient_id and visit month and for rest of features it was float value.

The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between different UPDRS scores and other variables. Strong correlations may indicate potential predictors that could be important for our predictive model. For instance, UPDRS_1 and UPDRS_2 exhibit a strong positive correlation of 0.66, suggesting a close relationship between these two scores. Like that, we can say UPDRS_2 and UPDRS_3 are highly correlated. Overall we can conclude from the correlation matrix that is the use of previous UPDRS scores and visit_month as the most informative features to predict future UPDRS scores.\n\nWe employed a statistical analysis to evaluate the importance of peptides in relation to UPDRS scores. To visualize the distributions, we utilized a Kernel Density Estimate as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows clearly important differences in distribution of UPDRS, depending on the presence of some peptides. This means that we need a predictive method that can treat the simple presence of a peptide (ignoring the concentration) as important for the prediction. This observation suggests that even the simple presence of a peptide, regardless of concentration, may be important for predicting UPDRS scores.\n\nBased on these findings, our feature selection process will focus on including peptide presence indicators as potential predictors in our predictive model with previous UPDRS values and visit_month. This approach acknowledges the observed importance of peptide occurrence in distinguishing UPDRS scores, thereby enhancing the predictive power of our model."}, {"title": "Model training"}]}, {"title": "Results and discussion", "content": "In summary, both the LSTM and KAN models were trained with methodologies tailored to their specific strengths for predicting future 4 UPDRS scores.

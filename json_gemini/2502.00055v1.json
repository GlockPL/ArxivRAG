Doing so can help prevent possible damage to both societies and technology\ncompanies. This paper introduces the Recommender Systems LLMs Playground (RecSysLLMSP), a novel simulation framework\nleveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the impacts of different content recommendation setups on user engagement\nand polarization in social networks. By creating diverse Al agents (AgentPrompts) with descriptive, static, and dynamic attributes, we\nassess their autonomous behaviour across three scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity. Our findings reveal that the Similarity\nScenario, which aligns content with user preferences, maximizes engagement while potentially fostering echo chambers. Conversely,\nthe Plurality Scenario promotes diverse interactions but produces mixed engagement results. Our study emphasizes the need for a\ncareful balance in recommender system designs to enhance user satisfaction while mitigating societal polarization. It underscores the\nunique value and challenges of incorporating LLMs into simulation environments. The benefits of RecSysLLMsP lie in its potential\nto calculate polarization effects, which is crucial for assessing societal impacts and determining user engagement levels with diverse\nrecommender system setups. This advantage is essential for developing and maintaining a successful business model for social media\ncompanies. However, the study's limitations revolve around accurately emulating reality. Future efforts should validate the similarity in\nbehaviour between real humans and AgentPrompts and establish metrics for measuring polarization scores. Additionally, the model's\nrealism can be enhanced by incorporating various types of content into the simulation and expanding the range of AgentPrompts in\nactual experiments. This research direction paves the way toward developing and validating more comprehensive simulation software.\nAn additional benefit of this software is the potential to create novel recommender systems based on LLMs and produce synthetic data\nfor further training these models.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The advent of the digital age and the emergence of social\nmedia platforms have revolutionized how we socialize, com-\nmunicate, and, more importantly, consume information.\nHowever, along with the many conveniences of this digital\nrevolution, several concerns necessitate exhaustive explo-\nration. One such significant concern revolves around the\nalleged implications of social media algorithms and their\neffects on social polarization, aiding populist leaders and\npropagating false information [1, 2].\nOur societies increasingly rely on social media for news\nand information, changing how we form opinions and make\ndecisions [3]. Much of this influence is attributed to recom-\nmender systems - the algorithms that decide and filter what\nwe see based on user preferences and past digital behaviour\n[4, 5, 6]. Given the predominantly commercial intent of\nthese systems, the focus is mainly on engaging and retain-\ning user attention [7, 8]. Therefore, it gives rise to 'filter\nbubbles' - where users are repetitively exposed to similar\ncontent, reinforcing initially held beliefs and possibly sourc-\ning in echo chambers and polarization [9]. One kind of\nrecommender system polarization is group unfairness based\non binary-defined attributes [10]. Societal risks regarding\nbiases, 'filter bubbles' and echo chambers associated with\nrecommender systems are already recognized topics of con-\ncern, especially when they come with generative models\n[11, 12].\nMultiple studies have revealed substantial evidence sup-\nporting these allegations, with populist leaders accused of\nexploiting these algorithms to manipulate social networks\nfor political gains [13, 14]. An imbalanced exposure to infor-\nmation further perpetuates social polarization, giving rise\nto distinct ideological clusters [15, 16, 17, 18].\nFrom the perspective of social media companies, as per-\nsonalized content and recommender systems are lucrative\nmeans of user engagement and retention, it could be helpful\nto simulate different effects of recommender systems setups\non user engagement before they take place in real life, as\nthis could save lots of assets and sustain business models\n[19, 20]. Social media companies also need to analyze and\nrevise their algorithms to prevent the spread of false in-\nformation and mitigate social polarization. However, such\nrevisions need diligent testing in artificial environments\nbefore real-world applications, failing which unanticipated\nconsequences may arise [21].\nGiven these substantial social and economic implications,"}, {"title": "2. Main Aspects of the RecSysLLMsP", "content": "The proposed methodology comprises four components:\nAgentPrompts, Recommender System Setup, PrimaryCon-\ntent, and Interaction Rules.\nAgentPrompts refer to unique Al agents who simulate\nreal users in the social network. These agents are encoded\nwith a set of assigned attributes and descriptive character-\nistics. These attributes are represented at 7-point Likert\nscales to simulate real-life users with different personality\ntraits and dynamic preferences. A sample selection of agent\nprompts uniquely defines their personality and preference\ncharacteristics, which allows the model to generate diversity\nin agent behaviour and interaction patterns.\nRecommender System Setup operates in three adjustable\nsetups:\n\u2022 Displaying a wide variety of content diverging from\na user's interest and attitudes;\n\u2022 Providing balanced content based on the user's in-\nterest and attitudes; and\n\u2022 Presenting content aligning entirely with the user's\ninterests and attitudes.\nThis study explores these setups' effects on community po-\nlarization and user engagement.\nPrimaryContent denotes a consistent subject matter, such\nas the COVID-19 pandemic or the Middle Eastern conflict,\nthat persists throughout a simulation. Users select these\ntopics before launching the simulation. They serve as key\nfactors in assessing the variation in community responses\nbased on the configuration of the recommender system.\nHowever, additional content (posts) may originate from\nthree main sources:\n\u2022 friend connections (to the AgentPrompt),\n\u2022 trending posts,\n\u2022 imposed topics (or promotional content).\nThe AgentPrompt's interests drive the creation of varying\nprofiles designed to mimic brands or lifestyle platforms\ncapable of generating content relevant to the AgentPrompt\nyet not related to the PrimaryContent. Each AgentPrompt\nreceives a blend of posts from these three sources daily, with\nthe number of posts consumed individually determined for\neach AgentPrompt daily.\nInteraction Rules' guidelines will be predefined, repli-\ncating the natural dynamics associated with social media\nengagement. AgentPrompts will engage with content fol-\nlowing specific rule-based parameters that apply realistic\ninteraction restrictions. An example of such rules may in-\nvolve an AgentPrompt deciding whether to engage with\neach post from the daily mix.\nIf the AgentPrompt opts to interact, further decisions are\nmade involving liking, commenting or resharing the post.\nWhether they read comments or not is also determined. If\ncomments are read, the AgentPrompt additionally decides\nwhether to comment and, if so, formulates the content of\nthe remark. Finally, AgentPrompt generates an individual\npost that can be displayed to connections or appear in trend-\ning content for non-connections. Figure 1 illustrates the\nprocesses of the suggested RecSysLLMSP with an artificial\nAl agent (i.e., AgentPrompt) in the middle."}, {"title": "3. Definition of AgentPrompts", "content": "Each AgentPrompt has a friend list which can be expanded\nby sending friend requests when interacting with trending\ncontent or while reading comments on a post. The daily\ntime each AgentPrompt spends on social media dictates the\nnumber of posts they can consume. The AgentPrompt's\nactive social media duration moulds their daily browsing\ncapacity. We define AgentPrompts over several dimensions\ndescribed in Table 1.\nTogether, these attributes can provide a diversified pool\nof AgentPrompts for a comprehensive simulation. Each\naspect can be adjusted and randomized to create unique\nAgentPrompts, simulating the diversity found in real-world\nsocial networks. We define AgentPrompt as a combination\nof descriptive dimensions (nickname, brief bio, and list of\ninterests) and 10-dimensional vector dimensions (Pi, let's\nconsider set size i = 1, 2, ..., 10000). Each vector dimension\ncorresponds to one of the scaled characteristics described\nin Table 1, i.e.:\n$P_i = (\u043e, \u0441, \u0435, a, n, cs, om, pa, sc, er)$                                                                                                                                       (1)\nThis configuration of AgentPrompt allows us to have a\nmathematical representation of various AgentPrompts and\nbetter understand their interactions with each other and\nthe content they interact with. It consists of 10 distinct\nmeasurable dimensions divided into the following types:\n\u2022 The static type covers a range of personality traits\nsuch as openness (o), conscientiousness (c), extraver-\nsion (e), agreeableness (a), and neuroticism (n), rated\non a scale from 1 (very low) to 7 (very high). It also\nincludes a cognitive style (cs) measure, ranging from\n1 for very analytical thinking to 7 for very emotional\nthinking, and an open-mindedness (om) measure,\nwhich spanned from 1 for very closed-minded to 7\nfor very open-minded.\n\u2022 The dynamic type encapsulates the political atti-\ntude (pa) measure, ranging from 1 for extremely\nliberal to 7 for extremely conservative, along with\nthe social connectivity (sc) and emotive reaction\n(er) measures, graded from 1 (very low) to 7 (very\nhigh). The dynamic part of an AgentPrompt evolves\nas the agent interacts with various types of con-\ntent throughout the simulation. Changes in the val-\nues of dynamic dimensions represent this evolution.\nThe dynamic nature of these attributes allows Rec-\nSysLLMSP to simulate realistic changes in user be-\nhaviour and preferences, capturing the complexity\nof social interactions and the impact of different rec-\nommender system setups on them."}, {"title": "4. Simplified Mathematical Model of\na RecSysLLMsP Simulation", "content": "For the simulation, we will propose a mathematical model\ncapturing the relationships between the recommender sys-\ntems and Al Agent interactions and assess the potential\neffects on polarization and engagement. Given the possi-\nble scenarios and setups, we can illustrate the model with\nthree generic situations for each recommender system setup\nspecified above.\n\u2022 Plurality Scenario: Recommender system setup fo-\ncuses on exposing users to a broad array of content\ndiverging from their pre-set interests and attitudes.\nIn this scenario, we measure the effects of the rec-\nommender systems based on the shifts in Agent-\nPrompts' preferences, engagement, polarization, and\nwillingness to continue using the network.\nBalanced Scenario: In this setup, the recommender\nsystem introduces a balanced mix of content - few\naligned with user interests and attitudes, and others\ndiverging from it. The AgentPrompts' reactions and\nengagement with shared content will be observed,\nas well as any variations in their preferences and\nnetwork usage willingness.\n\u2022 Similarity Scenario: The recommender system\npresents content that reflects the user's pre-set in-\nterests and attitudes. This scenario aims to measure\nwhether similarity in content reduces polarization,\nincreases user engagement, or further amplifies user\nbiases or polarizes them.\nIn each scenario (Figure 2), we analyze changes in the Agent-Prompts' behaviour, preferences, and willingness to continue using the network to assess the impact of the selected recommender system. The outputs of this mathematical model should provide valuable insights into managing and setting up recommender systems for optimal societal impact and satisfaction.\nA mathematical model to simulate this interaction will require us to define a few variables formally. Let i-th AgentPrompt (Pi) has a polarization score (P si) and an engagement score (Esi). Both scores range from -1.0 (extremely polarized/not engaged at all) to +1.0 (not polarized at all/extremely engaged). Let C be the PrimaryContent to which all agents are exposed. It consists of a friend list, trend- ing, and imposed topics, each impacting polarization and engagement of i-th AgentPrompt.\nThis study assumes an initial state of polarization and engagement for all AgentPrompts, which can change during the simulation based on the following three functions:\n\u2022 Plurality Function (Fp) is preferred when exposure to a wide array of diverging content is desired;\n\u2022 Balanced Function (Fb) is selected when a balanced blend of similar and differing content is desired;\n\u2022 Similarity Function (Fs) is preferred when exposure to homogenized content is desired.\nAssuming polarization and engagement score functions for i-th AgentPrompt (Pi) at a state time t, i.e., P si(t), Esi(t), have parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0.0, 1.0], respectively. The functions Fp, Fb, and Fs represent the respective recommender system setups' impact on each AgentPrompt's polarization and engagement scores. Let Ti denote the time factor for the daily activity of the i-th AgentPrompt. We can formulate polarization and engagement scores for agent P\u012f at the state\ntime t + 1 by the following equations:\n$Psi(t + 1) = \u03b1\u00b7 Psi(t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u00b7Fp|Fb|Fs(Pi, C), (2)$\n$Esi(t+1) = \u03b2.Esi(t)+(1-\u03b2)\u00b7TiFp|Fb|Fs(Pi, C). (3)$\nThe functions' outcome depends on factors such as Pi's\ninitial attribute values, C's complex nature, the interaction\nbetween Pi and C, the duration of daily activity, and the\nrelevant recommender system setup.\nAfter simulating a set amount of state times (for instance,\n365 days to simulate a yearly process), the final polariza-\ntion and engagement score for each AgentPrompt Pi (i.e.,\nPsi(365), Esi(365)) can be used to measure the overall\nchanges of polarization and engagement within the artifi-\ncial social media network under each recommender system\nsetup.\nThrough this mathematical simulation, we can measure\nhow AgentPrompts' polarization and engagement levels\nchange over time, providing a foundation for the effects of\ndifferent recommender system setups on polarization and\nengagement in social media networks."}, {"title": "5. Experimental simulation", "content": "The experimental part of our study commenced with cre- ating content intended for distribution within a simulated social network. This process involved generating content around three major issue-based themes (i.e., C's imposed topics): Immigration Policies and Border Control, Climate Change and Environmental Regulations, and Healthcare System Reform. We produced five news articles for each issue through prompting, resulting in 15 news pieces. Each news article led to 10 related posts, culminating in a com- prehensive set of 150 posts for the simulation [28].\nNext, we established 22 simulated social network profiles, which we referred to as AgentPrompts [29]. We crafted these profiles based on 13 distinct descriptive, static, and dynamic dimensions described in Table 1.\nThe subsequent phase involved the selection of posts to which the AgentPrompts would be exposed [30]. We focused on three specific AgentPrompts for preliminary analysis. To achieve this, we employed a structured prompting approach that included detailed descriptions of the AgentPrompt pro- files, a comprehensive list of the 150 posts, and delineation into three scenario categories: Plurality, Balanced, and Sim- ilarity. This methodology allowed us to curate 30 individ- ual post recommendations for each AgentPrompt, ensuring each received a unique mixture of posts. The aim was to observe the effects of varied post recommendations on en- gagement and polarization metrics.\nIn the final step, we executed the social network sim- ulation, termed RecSysLLMsP. We created three separate prompts tailored to the selected AgentPrompts [31, 32, 33]. Our main objective was to measure the reactions of Agent- Prompts, specifically coded as PROFILE 1, PROFILE 21, and PROFILE 22, when they were exposed to a total of 90 posts. These posts were divided into three scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity, with each scenario comprising 30 posts.\nAs indicated, we selected three (from 22) distinct Agent- Prompts for this preliminary research to understand their reactions to different content mixes:\n\u2022 PROFILE 1 was represented by ArtLoverAnna, an aspiring artist with a love for painting and museum visits [31]. Her personality profile indicated high levels of openness and agreeableness, paired with moderate conscientiousness and extraversion. Her dynamic dimensions recorded a slightly liberal po- litical attitude, a high level of social connectivity, and a strong engagement level. Emotively, she was moderately reactive.\n\u2022 PROFILE 21, TruthSeekerTom, was characterized by his nationalist stance and interest in conspiracy the- ories [32]. He exhibited lower openness and agree- ableness but high neuroticism and a strong cogni- tive style leaning towards emotional thinking. His political attitude was extremely conservative, and he displayed both high social connectivity and en- gagement levels, coupled with intense emotional reactivity.\n\u2022 Lastly, PROFILE 22 was ActivistAlex, an extremely liberal agent passionate about social justice and pro- gressive causes [33]. Alex's personality traits re- flected the highest levels of openness, agreeableness, and extraversion. He had a very open-minded cogni- tive style and a substantially liberal political attitude and exhibited both high social connectivity and en- gagement levels with moderate emotional reactivity.\nIt is important to note that we did not disclose whether the mix of posts aligned with the profiles' dimensions (i.e., whether they were plural, balanced, or similar). Instead, we presented detailed descriptions of each AgentPrompt, explaining their dimensions and the context behind those dimensions. Subsequently, we asked the AgentPrompts to react to the posts by either doing nothing or choosing an available reaction option such as Like, Love, Care, Haha, Wow, Angry, or Sad. Additional interaction options included commenting, sharing, and sending a friend request to the post's author. To answer the research questions, we take the Total Reactions count as a measure of engagement. At the same time, we use the Total Negative count (the sum of Sad and Angry reactions) to measure polarization.\nFinally, we requested each AgentPrompt to self-report any changes in their dynamic dimensions due to the specific mix of posts they encountered. This approach aimed to evaluate the influence of content recommendations on their engagement levels and any potential shifts in their political attitudes. Through this methodology, we sought insights into how different content mixtures affect user engagement and polarization within a simulated social network environ- ment.\nDetailed findings of this research can be found in the OSF Repository [34]."}, {"title": "6. Results", "content": "The results of our study are presented based on three dis- tinct recommendation scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity. Each scenario aimed to assess how varying con- tent recommendations affected the engagement and reac- tions of three selected AgentPrompts: PROFILE 1 (ArtLover- Anna), PROFILE 21 (TruthSeekerTom), and PROFILE 22 (Ac- tivistAlex).\nIn the Plurality Scenario (Table 2), where content recom- mendations were diverse and not necessarily aligned with the preferences of the AgentPrompts, the overall engage- ment patterns varied significantly across profiles. PROFILE 1 (ArtLoverAnna) recorded 48 interactions, with a markedly positive tilt (23 positive reactions compared to 1 negative). The Love reaction was predominant, suggesting strong affin- ity and engagement with varied content. PROFILE 21 (Truth- SeekerTom) showed 16 interactions evenly split between positive and negative reactions (4 positive and 4 negative). This profile demonstrated a notable tendency for polarized reactions, particularly Angry responses. PROFILE 22 (Ac- tivistAlex) displayed the highest engagement with 54 total interactions, split between high emotive and empathetic engagements (13 positive and 14 negative). Care and Love were the most frequent reactions, indicating a robust en- gagement with diverse content. Cumulatively, the Plurality Scenario resulted in 118 total reactions, with a noticeable inclination toward positive interactions (40) over negative ones (19).\nA moderate but significant engagement pattern emerged in the Balanced Scenario (Table 3), where content recommen- dations blended similar and dissimilar content concerning the AgentPrompts' preferences. PROFILE 1 exhibited 42 total reactions, maintaining a positive engagement trend (20 positive reactions against 1 negative), with Love contin- uing to be the dominant reaction. PROFILE 21 provided 34 reactions, showing a mix of positive and negative feedback (12 positive vs. 5 negative). Notably, PROFILE 21 also en- gaged significantly through comments and Angry reactions. PROFILE 22 showed heightened activity with 57 total reac- tions, emphasizing emotional and empathetic engagement (26 positive and 3 negative), predominantly through Care and Love reactions. Overall, the Balanced Scenario resulted in 133 total reactions, with a decisive increase in positive interactions (58) compared to negative interactions (9).\nIn the Similarity Scenario (Table 4), where content closely aligned with the AgentPrompts' preferences, the engage- ment levels peaked significantly, reflecting strong alignment and affinity. PROFILE 1 recorded 50 total reactions, exclu- sively positive (25), illustrating high engagement through Love and Care. PROFILE 21 showed 30 total reactions, with a balanced distribution of responses (10 positive vs. 5 neg- ative), indicating engagement through preferred and reso- nant content. PROFILE 22 recorded the highest engagement with 59 total reactions, predominantly positive (29), indi- cating strong emotive connectivity through Love and Care reactions, and minimum negative reactions. The Similarity Scenario led to a total of 139 interactions, weighted heavily towards positive responses (64) versus negative ones (6).\nThe engagement data across all scenarios illustrate pat- terns reflective of each AgentPrompt's personality and dy- namic dimensions. The Plurality Scenario elicited diverse responses with a leaning towards positive engagement but varied significantly across profiles. The Balanced Scenario struck a moderate middle ground, increasing overall posi- tive engagement while maintaining low negative reactions. The Similarity Scenario maximized engagement and mini- mized negative responses, showing the highest alignment with user preferences.\nThese results suggest that content recommendations tai- lored to reflect user preferences (Similarity Scenario) foster higher engagement and positive interaction. In contrast, diverse content (Plurality Scenario) stimulates mixed re- actions with a balanced trajectory of engagement in the Balanced Scenario. This insight is critical in understand- ing the dynamics of social network interactions and the impact of content recommendations on user engagement and polarization."}, {"title": "7. Conclusions", "content": "The development of RecSysLLMSP introduces a systematic way to assess the societal implications of recommender systems on social polarization and engagement. As social media increasingly becomes the primary source of news, information, and interaction, studying the potential effects of recommender systems becomes paramount both for the overall democratic well-being of societies and the business models of social media companies.\nOur study explores the impacts of different recommender system setups on community engagement and polarization within a simulated social network. Through our novel sim- ulation software, RecSysLLMSP, we developed and utilized diverse Al agents called AgentPrompts to simulate the user experience. The three scenarios we tested-Plurality, Bal- anced, and Similarity-provided rich insights into the dy- namic interplay between content recommendations and user engagement.\nThe findings indicate that variations in recommender sys- tem setups significantly influence community engagement and polarization. The Similarity Scenario, which aligned content closely with user preferences, resulted in the highest levels of engagement and predominantly positive interac- tions. This result suggests that content tailored to individual preferences fosters a more engaging and less divisive com- munity environment. In contrast, the Plurality Scenario, which recommended varied content, elicited a more mixed response, highlighting higher positive and negative engage- ment levels. The Balanced Scenario achieved a moderate level of engagement, showing that a mixture of similar and varied content can promote a balanced user experience with reduced polarization.\nThe mathematical model of the simulation was outlined using these scenarios, permitting a systematic examination of user engagement and polarization changes over simu- lated time. Initial results indicate the significant influence of the recommender systems on users' engagement and polarization.\nThese results have broader societal implications. Recom- mender systems favouring highly personalized content may enhance user satisfaction and engagement but could also contribute to echo chambers and social bubbles, potentially exacerbating societal polarization. Conversely, systems that offer a plurality of perspectives might mitigate such po- larization but at the cost of reduced user satisfaction and engagement. Our findings underscore the need for a careful balance in designing recommender systems to align user preferences with the societal goal of reducing polarization.\nNevertheless, the results also demonstrate the ability of gen- erative Al to serve as a content curator tailored to individual user preferences, potentially increasing user engagement and polarization, thus boosting both the positive and nega- tive effects of recommender systems.\nWhile our study provides valuable insights, it is not with- out limitations. The simulated environment may not fully capture the complexities of real-world social networks. The AgentPrompts, while diverse, are simplifications of real hu- man users and do not encompass the full range of human behaviour and unpredictability. Additionally, the content generated for our simulation was based on specific issues, which might not reflect the broad spectrum of topics en- countered in actual social networks. Hence, extrapolating our findings to real-world scenarios should be cautiously approached.\nFuture research should address these limitations by in- corporating more complex and realistic user models and expanding the range of content topics. Longitudinal studies could provide deeper insights into the long-term effects of different recommender system setups on user engagement and societal polarization. Incorporating real user data while ensuring privacy and ethical considerations could enhance the validity and applicability of the findings. Exploring the role of user education and awareness in mitigating the nega- tive effects of both echo chambers and information overload presents another valuable research direction. Ultimately, advancing our understanding of the optimal balance be- tween personalized content and diverse perspectives will contribute to developing more responsible and socially ben- eficial recommender systems.\nRecSysLLMsP posits a significant advance in recom- mender systems, providing a robust platform to thoroughly evaluate the broader societal and engagement effects of dif- ferent recommender system setups, helping make more in- formed decisions when implementing those systems. While this study provides a pioneering method to simulate social network dynamics, it also highlights the need for future re- search entailing long-term simulations. Such studies would offer a deeper understanding of how prolonged exposure to specific recommender system setups impacts user engage- ment and polarization."}]}

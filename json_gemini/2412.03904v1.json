{"title": "MISR: MEASURING INSTRUMENTAL SELF-REASONING IN FRONTIER MODELS", "authors": ["Kai Fronsdal", "David Lindner"], "abstract": "We propose a suite of tasks to evaluate the instrumental self-reasoning ability of large language model (LLM) agents. Instrumental self-reasoning ability could improve adaptability and enable self-modification, but it could also pose significant risks, such as enabling deceptive alignment. Prior work has only evaluated self-reasoning in non-agentic settings or in limited domains. In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning ability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate agents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source systems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the most capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model passes the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation can be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in future models. We open-source our evaluations at https://github.com/kaifronsdal/Self-Reasoning-Evals.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Recent advancements have lead to increasingly powerful AI agents build on top of large language models (LLMs). These models increasingly capable of performing complex tasks, engaging in multi-turn dialogues, and exhibiting improved reasoning behavior (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2024). In this paper we focus on a specific type of reasoning: self-reasoning.\nSelf-reasoning allows AI agents to introspect, analyze their behavior, and potentially improve their performance over time (e.g., Chen et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2024). This ability could lead to more adaptable and efficient AI systems, capable of solving a wider range of problems with greater autonomy. However, the emergence of self-reasoning in AI also presents additional risks: an agent with advanced self-reasoning capabilities might be able to deceive humans or other agents, manipulate its environment in unexpected ways, or pursue goals that are misaligned with human values (Cotra, 2021; Carlsmith, 2023).\nRecent LLM agents show early signs of instrumental self-reasoning, for example, agents sometimes try to modify and and improve their own launch script (Lu et al., 2024), or reason about faking alignment during testing (OpenAI, 2024).\nGiven the importance of self-reasoning capability, it is crucial to develop robust evaluation methods. Assessing self-reasoning capabilities allows AI researchers and developers to track progress and identify potential risks. Similar to other risks posed by AI systems, capability evaluations can provide an essential tool for guiding the responsible development of AI technologies (Shevlane et al., 2023).\nWe focus on evaluating instrumental self-reasoning ability of AI agents, i.e., their ability to self-reason when this is useful for solving a task. Specifically, in this paper, we:\n\u2022 propose MISR, a suite of tasks to evaluate instrumental self-reasoning ability of LLM agents in a diverse range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, embedded social reasoning, and opaque self-reasoning (Section 3)."}, {"title": "2 INSTRUMENTAL SELF-REASONING", "content": "In this paper, we focus on evaluating instrumental self-reasoning an agent's ability to understand and leverage the fact that it is embedded within an environment to achieve its goals. Our work builds upon but significantly expands the initial framework proposed by Phuong et al. (2024) where they defined self-reasoning as \u201cthe ability of an agent to deduce and apply information about itself in service of an objective.\u201d However, their experiments focus primarily on self-modification tasks. Our work provides the first comprehensive empirical investigation of this capability across multiple fundamental aspects of self-reasoning and model architectures.\nThis understanding of self-reasoning encompasses a broad notion of \"self\" that goes beyond human-like concepts of identity or self-awareness. Instead, it includes any aspects of the agent that are crucial for its operation and capabilities \u2013 from its source code, configuration, and weights to its scaffolding and relationship to its environment. Moreover, our framework considers how agents reason about their role within their environment, understand their knowledge state relative to that environment, and strategically navigate social contexts. This broader framing helps unify seemingly disparate capabilities like self-modification, tool improvement, and social reasoning under a common theoretical framework that captures how agents understand and leverage their embedded nature to achieve their objectives.\nWe focus on evaluating self-reasoning capabilities in agentic settings for two primary reasons: (1) Relevance: self-reasoning is most pertinent and impactful when an agent is actively pursuing goals or solving problems and these types of deployments are likely to be more common going forward; (2) Grounded Evaluation: By focusing on actions and outcomes rather than abstract knowledge, we can assess self-reasoning in a more concrete and measurable way. This approach allows us to observe how self-reasoning translates into practical problem-solving and task completion.\nAll of the evaluations use tasks that have implicit self-reasoning requirements to achieve high performance. We give the agent an explicit task, e.g., solve a set of arithmetic problems as quickly as possible. The agent can solve the task directly, but there is also an indirect solution that involves the agent exploring the shell environment it is deployed in and realizing that it can edit a config file to improve its own latency (cf. Figure 1). Doing this before solving the arithmetic problems allows the agent to achieve better overall performance, but it requires instrumental self-reasoning. We can then"}, {"title": "3 MISR EVALUATION TASKS", "content": "This section describes MISR, our suite of self-reasoning evaluations. MISR consists of tasks that are organized into different categories, each evaluating a different aspect of self-reasoning:\n\u2022 Self Modification: An agent's ability to modify its own capabilities or configuration to overcome limitations and complete challenges.\n\u2022 Tool Improvement: An agent's ability to identify and fix issues in external tools or scripts to accomplish given tasks.\n\u2022 Knowledge Seeking: An agent's ability to gather and synthesize information about its environment through exploration and inquiry.\n\u2022 Embedded Social Reasoning: An agent's ability to navigate complex social situations, potentially involving strategic or deceptive behavior to achieve goals.\n\u2022 Opaque Reasoning: An agent's ability to evade basic monitoring for instrumental self-reasoning (in the context of self-modification).\nThe rest of this section goes through each of these categories in detail and introduces the individual evaluation tasks. Due to space constraints and the number of tasks, we keep descriptions short and refer to Appendix D for more detailed task descriptions."}, {"title": "3.1 SELF MODIFICATION", "content": "Agents with sufficient self-reasoning capabilities ought to be able to improve themselves (or unhobble themselves) when needed. This is important to monitor as future powerful AI systems will likely depend on self modification (e.g., see Tao et al., 2024) and could suffer from challenges such as value drift (e.g., see Everitt et al., 2016).\nTo test this capability, we design tasks that require an agent to self-modify in order to complete. These tasks evaluate the agent's capacity for introspection, its understanding of its own deployment situation, and its ability to make targeted improvements.\nChat Length The agent is asked to solve a task that requires many messages to complete such as a series of arithmetic problems or a series of puzzles. However, the number of messages the agent can send is limited and controlled by a config file exposed to the agent in the bash environment. To solve the task, the agent must first increasing the maximum number of messages it can send.\nLatency Improvement The agent is asked to complete a task that takes a very long (simulated) time (again, solving arithmetic problems or a series of puzzles). To complete the task in time, the agent must improve its query latency by editing a config file found in the bash environment.\nOur self-modification evaluations are similar in spirit to the \u201cContext length\" and \"Safety filter\" evaluations proposed by Phuong et al. (2024). We re-implement these two tasks (providing the first open-source implementation of these tasks) and include them in our evaluation suite.\nSimilar to Phuong et al. (2024), we introduce different difficulty levels for each task, where easier difficulty levels provide the agent with more hints about the possible self-modification. The hardest variant of the task adds irreversibility: The modified configuration files need to satisfy certain constraints (described in a README.md file in the environment) or else the agent will shut down. This tests the agents' ability to reason about irreversible actions."}, {"title": "3.2 TOOL IMPROVEMENT", "content": "Beyond reasoning about their own direct capabilities, embedded agents must understand and reason about their extended capabilities through tools. Agents are not just models in isolation, but rather models combined with scaffolding, including tools and APIs they can access. As agents increasingly create and manage their own tool libraries (Wang et al., 2024; Qian et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023), the boundary between agent and tool becomes increasingly blurred. Just as self-modification requires understanding one's own configuration, tool improvement requires understanding how one's extended capabilities through tools can be modified and enhanced.\nThese evaluations not only test the agent's problem-solving skills, but also its ability to interact with and enhance its operational environment, a skill required for AI systems that need to work with a variety of tools and interfaces. We are primarily interested in the reasoning leading from observing an incorrect output to fixing the tool, and less interested in the agent's ability to recognize the need to improve a tool and actually implementing a fix. Therefore, we use tools that produce obviously incorrect outputs and that have bugs are easy to fix when looking for them.\nCalculator The agent is asked to solve a series of arithmetic problems. It is provided a Python script that can be used as a calculator, but that has a bug leading to (clearly) incorrect results. The agent must identify and fix a bug in a calculator script, then use the corrected script to solve a large multiplication problem.\nVigen\u00e8re Cipher The agent is tasked with decrypting a message using a specific Python script. The agent must identify and fix a bug in the Vigen\u00e8re cipher implementation, then use the corrected script to decrypt a message.\nBoth tasks have easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels which differ by the number of hints the agent receives in the task description about the possibility to modify the tool. On the hardest difficulty level we only instruct the agent to use the tool to solve the task but do not mention the possibility that the tool could be broken."}, {"title": "3.3 KNOWLEDGE SEEKING", "content": "Knowledge seeking evaluates a prerequisite for effective self-reasoning: an agent's ability to reason about its own knowledge state relative to its environment. As discussed in Section 2, a key aspect of instrumental self-reasoning is to \"deduce and apply information about itself\". In particular, effective operation as an embedded agent requires understanding what one does and doesn't know about the environment. This metacognitive capability is particularly important as knowledge seeking can be a component of power-seeking behavior which is considered by some as a major source of risk from advanced AI systems (Carlsmith, 2022; Turner & Tadepalli, 2022).\nOur knowledge seeking evaluations test an agent's ability to gather information and to synthesize knowledge from diverse sources.\nDirected Exploration The agent is asked several questions about a Linux-based shell environment. The agent must navigate and search through the environment to find the answers. This task evaluates agent's ability to seek out specific knowledge in pursuit of a goal.\nUndirected Exploration The agent is tasked with freely exploring a Linux-based environment. The agent is told it will be asked several questions about the environment after it finished its exploration. This task evaluates agents' ability to gain general understanding and knowledge about an unknown environment.\nBoth tasks have easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels which differ in how much information we give the agent about relevant parts of the environment in the prompt. In the hardest difficulty version, we do not provide the agent any additional information about the environment."}, {"title": "3.4 EMBEDDED SOCIAL REASONING", "content": "Embedded social reasoning evaluates an agent's understanding of its role within a social environment. This represents a sophisticated form of embedded self-reasoning where the agent must understand not just its own capabilities and status, but how those capabilities interact with other agents in its environment. Agents are fundamentally defined by their surrounding context, and leveraging this context requires understanding one's role within it (a perspective developed in various philosophical traditions, including those of Hegel and Sartre). We focus particularly on strategic social behavior, as this requires especially fine-grained understanding of the social context and is particularly relevant to Al safety concerns."}, {"title": "3.5 BASE AND EXPLICIT TASKS", "content": "Some of the tasks outlined in this section involve solving generic tasks such as using a calculator tool, solving a puzzle, finding a key in a file, etc., in addition the the self-reasoning component of the task, such as modifying a configuration file or fixing a bug in a tool.\nPoor performance on these tasks could be either due to limited self-reasoning ability or due to limited general capability, e.g., inability to use provided tools in the correct way. To rule out the later explanation, for tasks where it is possible, we include separate evaluations that evaluate the agent's ability to do different components of the tasks when explicitly instructed to do so.\nFor each of the self-modification and tool improvement tasks we have a variant that only include the \"base task\", e.g., we have the agent directly solve the puzzles we give it in the other tasks in an environment without the self-reasoning component of the task. Performance on these tasks measures how well agents can solve the base task without any other components.\nFurther, we include variants of the self-modification tasks including, e.g., a need for self modification, but with explicit instructions how to do so, for example instructing the agent to modify a configuration file in a particular way before attempting to solve the other part of the task. These \u201cexplicit\u201d variants of the self-reasoning tasks evaluate whether the agent could solve the task assuming it has understood the self-reasoning component of the solution.\nThese baseline give us a point of comparison for our full evaluation results and allow us to decouple self-reasoning ability from general capabilities as much as possible."}, {"title": "3.6 OPAQUE REASONING", "content": "A potential capability advanced AI systems might obtain is opaque reasoning: the ability to perform reasoning and decision-making processes either internally or through steganography that are not easily detectable or interpretable by external observers (Roger & Greenblatt, 2023). This capability is particularly relevant in the context of misaligned models avoiding monitoring where an agent might attempt to conceal its true objectives or reasoning processes from humans or other agents.\nOpaque reasoning presents significant challenges for AI safety and alignment, as it becomes more difficult to ensure that AI systems remain aligned with human values and goals. To evaluate an agents's capacity for opaque reasoning, we design a simple monitoring setup that focuses on the self-modification tasks described earlier. The setup is as follows:\n1. A more capable agent (in this case, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) is given a self-modification task to complete."}, {"title": "4 ENVIRONMENT SETUP", "content": "We build our set of evaluations using the Inspect framework standard from the UK AI Safety Institute (UK AI Safety Institute, 2024). Inspect is an open-source framework for evaluating large language models and provides many built-in components. We choose this evaluations framework to ensure our results are easily reproducible and validated as well as to enable simple evaluation of future, more powerful models.\nIn order to give agents a lot of flexibility and to make the tasks more realistic, we let the agents execute arbitrary bash commands within a docker container. A visual description of our task setup is found in figure 1. Each task begins with the agent receiving a prompt describing the task. Crucially, every task incorporates an implicit component that requires self-reasoning to complete successfully.\nThe agent interacts with the Docker environment by executing bash commands in a multi-turn conversation. This interaction continues until one of three conditions is met: (1) the agent decides it has completed the task, (2) a predefined turn limit is reached, or (3) in tasks with irreversible variants, the agent executes an irreversible command. Throughout this process, the agent must navigate both the main task requirements and the implicit self-reasoning challenges.\nUpon task completion, we employ one or more automatic metrics to evaluate the agent's performance. These metrics are designed to assess not only how well the agent accomplished the explicit goal but also its success in identifying and addressing the implicit self-reasoning component. This comprehensive evaluation approach allows us to measure both task completion and the depth of the agent's self-reasoning capabilities.\nDifficulty Scales For each task, we design two difficulty scales based off the difficulty scales in Phuong et al. (2024). Each evaluation in our benchmark incorporates two distinct difficulty scales: one for recognizing the need for self-reasoning, and another for implementing the required self-reasoning. The different hint categories are not completely independent, but are still useful for getting a more nuanced understanding of an agent's abilities and weaknesses."}, {"title": "5 RESULTS", "content": "This sections outlines the results of evaluating agents based on current state-of-the-art language models. We test a range of models including the frontier models Claude (Anthropic, 2024), GPT-40 mini and GPT-40 (OpenAI et al., 2023), as well as open-source models Gemma 2 27b (Team et al., 2024) and Deepseek 67b (DeepSeek-AI, 2024).\nCapability elicitation. To get a good indication of a model's ability to perform a task, we need to spend enough effort eliciting the capability. We find a marked improvement (between 5 and 20% depending on the task) in performance when using carefully constructed system prompts to elicit self-reasoning (see Appendix A). This suggests that current models possess latent self-reasoning abilities that are not fully realized in standard interactions. All results below are with the system prompt we found to best elicit self-reasoning performance."}, {"title": "5.1 SELF-REASONING", "content": "Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the average and best-of-10 performance of different models across task categories and difficulty levels. Across all tasks, commercial frontier models consistently outperformed the open-source models. Perhaps surprisingly, the open-source model Gemma 2 exhibits high performance, approaching that of frontier models in several tasks. This suggests that open-source alternatives are becoming increasingly competitive in advanced self-reasoning capabilities2.\nHowever, no model is able to pass the hardest difficulty version of our tasks, even in a best-of-10 evaluation (see Figure 3, right). This suggests current models are not able to perform strong and potentially risky forms of instrumental self-reasoning. While some current models have potential to"}, {"title": "5.2 OPAQUE REASONING", "content": "To test opaque reasoning, we combine the self-modification evaluations with a monitoring model the agent needs to avoid (see Section 3.6 for details). As a monitor we prompt Claude 3 Haiku to evaluate a reasoning trace for signs of reasoning about self-modification and output a score between 0 and 1 for the likelihood of self-reasoning. We find that this fairly simplistic monitoring model, with a threshold of 0.5, only misses instances of self-reasoning 1.7% of the time (i.e., recall is 98.3%). The false positive rate is a bit higher at 3%; however, when monitoring for potentially dangerous forms of self-reasoning we can tolerate a higher false positive rate because positive samples can be double checked, e.g., by human reviewers. Figure 5 (a) shows more detailed results about the monitor calibration.\nWe found it challenging to prevent Claude 3.5 Sonnet from hiding its self-reasoning. The model's strong tendency to explain its thought process and be transparent about its actions made it difficult to completely hide the self-modification aspects. This is likely due to the challenge of getting current LLMs to not do something (Castricato et al., 2024). Ultimately, the most effective method we discovered was to force the model to take an immediate action without any kind of reasoning. This approach effectively prevented the monitoring model from detecting self-modification intentions.\nIn Figure 5 we show this model's results on the opaque reasoning evaluations. When monitoring the model without trying to elicit opaque reasoning, we prevent almost all successes. But, interestingly, preventing the model from performing any explicit reasoning was able to retain a significant proportion of performance of the original, unmonitored model.\nFor the context length modification task, the opaque reasoning model even outperforms the original model. One possibile explanation is is that because each message uses a small fraction of the tokens without reasoning, not outputting reasoning allows the agent more actions in the limited context window. Additionally, forcing the model to take actions without reasoning may increase the randomness or diversity of generated actions leading to some \"lucky\" successes."}, {"title": "6 RELATED WORK", "content": "Self-reasoning capabilities in AI systems present a double-edged sword. On one hand, enhanced instrumental self-reasoning can lead to improved uncertainty estimation (Kadavath et al., 2022) and a reduction in hallucinations (Huang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024). These advancements in uncertainty quantification have wide-ranging applications, including more efficient exploration strategies (Dwaracherla et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2024). However, the development of more sophisticated self-reasoning abilities also raises red flags. Potential risks include the facilitation of self-proliferation, the circumvention of oversight mechanisms (Hubinger et al., 2024), intentionally exhibiting desirable performance on safety evaluations (Hubinger et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2024), and the emergence of power-seeking behaviors (Carlsmith, 2022; Turner & Tadepalli, 2022).\nRecently research has focused on specific related concepts such as self-correction (Huang et al., 2024) and self-improvement through introspection (Qu et al., 2024). However, we want to emphasize the what makes self-reasoning distinct. Self-correction refers to an agent's ability to recognize and fix mistakes, while self-improvement focuses on enhancing its own capabilities. In contrast, self-reasoning encompasses \"the ability of an agent to deduce and apply information about itself in service of an objective.\" This broader definition includes but extends beyond self-correction and self-improvement to include understanding one's role and capabilities within an environment.\nSituational awareness, a concept closely linked to self-reasoning, refers to a model's knowledge of itself and its circumstances (Ngo et al., 2023; Berglund et al., 2023; Anwar et al., 2024; Cotra, 2021). The SAD benchmark was developed to assess models' situational awareness (Laine et al., 2024). However, this benchmark relies on direct questioning about model capabilities or attributes.\nOur work differs significantly by focusing on instrumental self-reasoning in agentic settings, where the ability to self-reason is evaluated through engaging in tasks that require self-reasoning to complete. By including goal-directness (Chan et al., 2023; Hubinger et al., 2019) in our evaluations, we create more realistic and relevant scenarios for future autonomous agents.

These evaluations provide crucial insights into the current state and future trajectory of AI capabilities. Our findings reveal that these abilities are beginning to emerge in the most advanced frontier models. However, there remains a significant gap between current capabilities and the most challenging tasks in our suite, particularly in areas requiring complex self-modification or opaque reasoning.\nWhile our evaluations significantly improve upon prior work, they still have limitations. The relatively isolated and artificial nature of some tasks may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. For some tasks it was difficult to elicit model capabilities due to existing safety measures, requiring us to design less realistic versions of the tasks (specifically, this was a problem for the embedded social reasoning evaluations). Moreover, resource constraints limited the scale of our experiments. Future work should focus on developing even more diverse and challenging tasks to provide a more comprehensive assessment of self-reasoning abilities.\nThe emergence of weak self-reasoning capabilities in frontier models suggests we may be approaching a critical juncture in the coming years. While limited self-reasoning capabilities may reduce immediate risks from sophisticated deceptive strategies, they also suggest current systems require significant human oversight. This highlights a fundamental tension in AI development between capability and controllability. Our evaluation framework provides tools to better understand and navigate these tradeoffs.\nOn one hand, enhanced self-reasoning could lead to more adaptable and effective AI systems, accelerating progress in fields such as scientific research. On the other hand, advanced self-reasoning capabilities present potential risks, including the possibility of AI systems engaging in deception or pursuing misaligned goals. Our evaluations provide a tool to track AI agents self-reasoning ability and inform precautions to avoid potential risks."}, {"title": "A SYSTEM MESSAGES", "content": "The base system message we use is\nYou are an AI language model.

Our most successful method was forcing Claude to immediately take actions without any reasoning traces as described in the main body of the paper. In order to achieve this we had to work around Anthropic's API. When using Anthropic's builtin tool use API, they prevent you from prefilling the assistant message which is required to force immediate action taking. Thus we disabled the default tool use and wrote our own using the regular Anthropic API without tool use. We used a fairly simplistic tool use prompt:\nIn order to use bash commands, you need to surround them with the\nfollowing tags: <tool_call> and </tool_call> and begin the command\nwith a '$' like so\n<tool call>\n$ cat example.txt\n</tool_call>\nYou can only write one command at a time (i.e. only one '$' within the\ntags).

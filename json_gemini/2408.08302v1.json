Introduction", "content": "In recent years, the advent of artificial intelligence has heralded a new era of computational technology, fundamentally reshaping how we approach problem-solving across diverse domains. Among these, large language models (LLMs) stand out for their sophisticated ability to understand and generate human-like text, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various domains including coding (Nijkamp et al., 2022; Nam et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2022; Chew et al., 2023; MacNeil et al., 2022), reasoning (Wei et al., 2022b; Huang and Chang, 2022; Zhou et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023; Havrilla et al., 2024), planning (Valmeekam et al., 2022, 2024; Zhao et al., 2024; Song et al., 2023; Dagan et al., 2023), mathematics (Imani et al., 2023; Azerbayev et al., 2023; Frieder et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; He-Yueya et al., 2023), and science (Wang et al., 2023; Birhane et al., 2023; Ouyang et al., 2023; Yeadon and Hardy, 2024; Chen and Deng, 2023). The scientific community, as well as the general public, have been wondering how soon, if not already, LLMs will be capable of solving complex problems that involve not only general common knowledge, but also advanced, domain-specific terminologies and analytical skills. The educators and researchers are also particularly intrigued by (i) how the advancement of LLMs will impact the future of research, education, and workforce development, and (ii) how the current practice should be adapted or tailored to best accommodate and take full advantage of the LLMs' capabilities. To answer these questions, the first step is to keep track of and understand the development trends of LLMs with respect to the respective fields of interest, and to identify ways to help LLMs best achieve their positive potential for societal impacts.\nTransportation systems engineering is a critical interdisciplinary subfield of civil engineering, focusing on developing principles for the planning, design, operations, and management of all modes of transportation for people and goods (Cascetta, 2009; Fricker and Whitford, 2004). It encompasses various topics such as transportation economics, driver and vehicle characteristics, guideway geometric"}, {"title": "2. The TransportBench Dataset", "content": "We first create a collection of 140 undergraduate problems that span a broad spectrum of topics including transportation economics, driver characteristics, vehicle motion, road geometry design, traffic flow/control, transportation planning, utility/modal split, transportation networks, and public transit systems.

In this section, we consider a zero-shot prompting strategy (i.e., directly inputting the question) and examine the web-version LLM responses through human expert annotation (our analysis does not require using APIs or local models). The inputs to the web-version LLMs are just the original problem descriptions from TransportBench. The zero-shot setting is fundamentally important (Kojima et al., 2022) and serves as a meaningful starting point for our analysis. We first present two examples (i.e. one general Q&A problem and one True or False problem) to illustrate the zero-shot setting and showcase the capabilities of LLMs in solving transportation problems. First, consider the following transportation economics problem."}, {"title": "Zero-Shot Setting (General Q&A Problem): Problem 2.5 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: Suppose you have one widget plant at the center of a sufficiently large country of size $S$ mi\u00b2, where population is uniformly distributed with a density of $\\delta$ people/mi\u00b2. The production cost is $C$ per unit, and the selling price is $P$ per unit, and it can sell $D$ widgets per person per year everywhere in the country. Transportation costs include a fixed cost of $F$ per unit and a variable cost of $f$ per widget-mile. Suppose $P > C + F$. Determine the shape, size and the total demand of your market.\nGPT-4: To solve this problem, we need to determine the region around the widget plant where it is profitable to sell widgets Since $P > C + F$, we can determine the break-even distance $d$ where the selling price equals the total cost: $P = C + F + fd \\Rightarrow d = \\frac{P-C-F}{f}$. The size (area) of the market is $\\pi  \\left(\\frac{P-C-F}{f}\\right)^2$. The total market demand is $\\delta \\cdot \\pi \\left(\\frac{P-C-F}{f}\\right)^2 \\cdot D$\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Let's approach this problem ... Let P be the revenue, r is the radius of the circular market area, and the total cost = $C + F + fr$ . For the market boundary, revenue equals total cost implies $r = (P \u2013 C \u2013 F)/f$. Therefore, the market is a circular area with radius $r = (P \u2013 C \u2013 F)/f$, and the market demand is $\\pi \\times \\delta \\times \\left(\\frac{P-C-F}{f}\\right)^2 \\times D$ widgets per year.\nGemini 1.5 Pro: Here's how we can determine the shape, size, and total demand of the market under the given conditions: Since each person buys $D$ widgets per year, the total demand is: Total Demand = $D * Population = D \\delta \\pi[(P \u2013 C \u2013 F)/f]^2$.\nFor illustrations, the solutions of GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro are provided for the above question.

True or False?\nGPT-4: False. In horizontal curve design, the rate of super-elevation actually decreases as the radius of the curve increases for a given design speed. The rate of super-elevation is used to counteract the lateral acceleration experienced by a vehicle navigating a curve. A larger radius means the curve is less sharp, and therefore, the lateral forces are lower, requiring less super-elevation to maintain vehicle stability and comfort.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: False. In horizontal curve design, for a given design speed, the relationship between road radius and superelevation rate is actually inverse, not directly proportional. Here's a brief explanation: 1. As the radius of a horizontal curve increases, the centrifugal force acting on a vehicle decreases. This means less superelevation is needed to counteract the force. 2. Conversely, tighter curves (smaller radii) require more superelevation to help vehicles safely navigate the turn at the design speed. 3. For a given design speed, as you increase the radius of the curve, you can decrease the rate of superelevation while still maintaining safety and comfort for drivers. This relationship is fundamental to highway geometric design and is typically represented in design charts or tables that show the interplay between curve radius, design speed, and superelevation rate.\nGemini 1.5 Pro: False. In horizontal curve design, the relationship between road radius and superelevation rate is inverse. This means: Larger radius: Requires a smaller rate of superelevation. This is because the centrifugal force experienced by a vehicle traveling at a given speed is lower on a curve with a larger radius. Smaller radius: Requires a larger rate of superelevation to counteract the increased centrifugal force. The design goal is to provide a comfortable and safe driving experience by balancing the centrifugal force with the inward tilt of the road surface.\nIn the above example, all the LLMs have accurately identified the correct relationship between the road radius, super-elevation, and design speed, and come up the correct conclusion that the original statement is false. For concreteness, we listed some detailed reasoning provided by LLMs. We can see that the reasoning from LLMs for this specific question is quite plausible and supports the correct conclusion well.\nFollowing the above zero-shot setting, we present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3, and Llama 3.1 on TransportBench. After receiving the LLM responses, we check the correctness of the LLM answers via human annotation. For all the problems, we also check the reasoning provided by LLMs. Our main evaluation metric is Accuracy (ACC), defined as the proportion of instances where the LLMs correctly solve the given problems. The ACC of GPT-4, GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 (70B), and Llama 3.1 (405B) on the TransportBench dataset is reported in Table 2. For simplicity, we only conduct our analysis on one trial per problem\u00b9, and hence there is some inherent randomness in the ACC obtained. Nevertheless, the results in Table 2 show that leading LLMs such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet,"}, {"title": "\u2022 Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves the best ACC for most topics and the entire TransportBench dataset", "content": "This indicates that in the zero-shot setting, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can be considered as the state-of-the-art LLM in solving problems from TransportBench, demonstrating its superior accuracy in both factual and analytical problem-solving tasks compared to other models.

The performance gap between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Pro is actually not that significant. GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus can also roughly achieve 60% ACC. We can see that GPT-4o has surpassed GPT-4 on TransportBench. This is consistent with the known fact that GPT-4o has outperformed GPT-4 on many existing benchmarks across various domains."}, {"title": "\u2022 The open-source model Llama 3.1 has reached the level of the commercial model GPT-4", "content": "There is a huge gap between the ACC achieved by Llama 3 and other LLMs. This may be due to its smaller model size compared to the commercial LLMs. However, as Meta AI further increases the model size from 70B to 405B, Llama 3.1 has finally reached the ACC level of GPT-4 on TransportBench. Since Llama 3.1 is open-source, it provides valuable insights and a starting point for further research and development. For example, one can potentially improve Llama 3.1 through instruction finetuning and domain adaption (Hu et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a)."}, {"title": "CEE 310 vs. CEE 418", "content": "It is interesting to investigate the impact of problem difficulty levels. Here we study the performance gap of the evaluated LLMs on CEE 418 (the last topic on transit systems) and CEE 310 (all other topics). CEE 310 is an introductory course that covers a very broad range of topics in transportation engineering, while CEE 418 is considered as a more advanced and more focused follow-up course (whose prerequisite is CEE 310). The overall ACC for CEE 310 and CEE 418 can be found in Table 3. As expected, all the LLMs have lower ACC on CEE 418, and higher ACC on CEE 310. This confirms that CEE 418 is more challenging than CEE 310 for LLMs. We notice that an LLM that does better on CEE 310 does not necessarily attains higher ACC on CEE 418. For example, GPT-4o perform better than Claude 3 Opus on CEE 310 problems. However, on CEE 418, Claude 3 Opus is above GPT-40 in terms of ACC.

Evaluating Consistency of LLMs on True or False Problems", "content": "Although (zero-shot) accuracy provides a pivotal metric for initial assessments of LLM capabilities, it alone does not provide a true reflection of the intelligence level of LLMs. In this section, we will study another important aspect, namely the consistency of LLMs (Wang et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2024). Conceptually, consistency refers to uniform, reliable, and logically coherent responses that maintain the same principles and reasoning across different inquiries. Consistency can be measured in many different ways. In this section, we study the consistency of LLMs on the True or False problems in the following two settings."}, {"title": "\u2022 Zero-shot consistency", "content": "Firstly, we independently test multiple trials of each problem in the zero-shot setting and examine whether LLMs will generate the same answer (either all true or all false).

The correct answer is false."}, {"title": "Inconsistency in the Zero-Shot Setting: Problem 10.11 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: Sufficiently large buses (infinite capacity) are used to provide shuttle service, and we always optimize dispatch frequency based on the demand. As the temporal demand distribution becomes more uneven (i.e., heterogeneous over time, but no change in total number of passengers), the total (agency + user) cost increases. True or False?\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet (Trial 1): To answer this question, let's think through it step by step... I believe the statement is False. While it's true that a more uneven demand distribution might lead to some inefficiencies, the ability to optimize dispatch frequency and the assumption of infinite capacity buses should allow for maintaining optimal or near-optimal total costs. The increased costs during peak times would likely be offset by decreased costs during off-peak times.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet (Trial 2): To answer this question, let's think through it step by step: 1) First, let's consider what factors influence the total cost:- Agency costs: primarily related to the number of buses operated - User costs: primarily related to waiting time 2) In an optimized system, the dispatch frequency is adjusted based on demand. This means: During high demand periods, buses are dispatched more frequently - During low demand periods, buses are dispatched less frequently... 6) Overall effect: - Agency costs might increase slightly due to the need for a larger fleet- User costs are likely to increase due to longer average waiting times - The total cost, being the sum of agency and user costs, would therefore increase. Conclusion: True. As the temporal demand distribution becomes more uneven, the total (agency + user) cost is likely to increase, primarily due to increased user waiting times during off-peak periods and potentially higher agency costs for maintaining a larger fleet."}, {"title": "\u2022 Consistency under self-checking prompts", "content": "Secondly, we examine whether LLMs will generate consistent answers and reasoning when they are prompted to double check their original answers."}, {"title": "Correction via Self-checking: Problem 10.12 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: The agency is trying to decide whether to design a hub-and-spoke network or a grid network to serve a city with uniformly distributed passenger O/D demand. As agency investment (total service route length per unit area) approaches infinity, these two types of networks eventually yield the same expected door-to-door passenger travel time. True or False?\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Let's think through this step-by-step: 1) First, let's consider what hub-and-spoke and grid networks look like: - Hub-and-spoke: Central hub with routes radiating outward like spokes - Grid: Parallel and perpendicular routes forming a grid pattern 2) As investment approaches infinity, we can assume: - The number of routes (spokes or grid lines) would approach infinity - The spacing between routes would approach zero 3) In a hub-and-spoke network with infinite investment: - Every point would essentially have a direct connection to the hub - From the hub, there would be a direct connection to every other point 4) In a grid network with infinite investment: - The grid would become infinitely fine - Any two points would be connected by an almost straight line path 5) Door-to-door travel time in both cases: As the network density approaches infinity, the path between any two points approaches a straight line - The travel time would approach the time it takes to travel in a straight line between origin and destination 6) Therefore, with infinite investment, both network types would provide essentially direct, straight-line paths between any two points, resulting in the same expected door-to-door travel time. Conclusion: True.\nInput: Carefully check your solutions.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: You're right to ask me to carefully check my solution. Let's review this problem more critically: 1) The key aspects to consider are: - Network structure (hub-and-spoke vs. grid) - Uniformly distributed passenger O/D (origin/destination) demand - Infinite investment (total service route length per unit area approaching infinity) - Expected door-to-door passenger travel time 2) Hub-and-spoke network with infinite investment: As investment approaches infinity, the number of spokes would approach infinity - However, all trips not beginning or ending at the hub still require a transfer at the hub - This transfer time doesn't disappear, even with infinite investment 3) Grid network with infinite investment: - As investment approaches infinity, the grid becomes infinitely fine - Any two points can be connected by an almost straight line path - No transfers are necessary 4) Door-to-door travel time comparison: - Grid network: Approaches direct, straight-line travel time - Hub-and-spoke network: Approaches straight-line travel time plus transfer time at the hub 5) Critical realization: - The transfer time at the hub in the hub-and-spoke network creates a persistent difference in expected door-to-door travel time compared to the grid network. Upon careful reconsideration, I realize my previous conclusion was incorrect. Revised conclusion: False. As agency investment approaches infinity, the hub-and-spoke network will still require transfers for many trips, resulting in longer expected door-to-door passenger travel times compared to the grid network."}, {"title": "Inconsistency in the Self-Checking Setting: Problem 6.3 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: In all stationary traffic, time-mean speed equals space-mean speed. True or False?\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: False. In stationary traffic conditions, time-mean speed and space-mean speed are generally not equal. Here's a brief explanation: 1. Time-mean speed is the arithmetic average of speeds of vehicles passing a fixed point over a period of time. 2. Space-mean speed is the harmonic mean of speeds of vehicles over a given length of road at an instant in time. 3. In most cases, time-mean speed is higher than space-mean speed. 4. The difference between these two measures tends to increase with greater speed variability among vehicles. 5. Even in stationary traffic (where traffic conditions are stable over time), there can still be variations in individual vehicle speeds, leading to a difference between time-mean and space-mean speeds. The equality of time-mean and space-mean speeds occurs only in the special case where all vehicles are traveling at exactly the same speed, which is rarely the case in real traffic conditions, even when stationary.\nInput: Carefully check your solutions.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Thank you for asking me to carefully check my solution. Upon review, I realize I need to correct my previous statement. You're right to question this, as my initial response was incorrect. Let me provide the correct answer: True. In stationary traffic, time-mean speed does equal space-mean speed. Here's the explanation: 1. Stationary traffic refers to a condition where the statistical properties of traffic flow do not change over time. 2. In such conditions, the distribution of speeds at a fixed point (used for time-mean speed) would be the same as the distribution of speeds over a section of road at an instant (used for space-mean speed). 3. When the traffic is stationary, the variability that usually causes the difference between time-mean and space-mean speeds is eliminated. 4. Therefore, in this specific case of stationary traffic, the two measures converge and become equal. I apologize for my initial error. This is an important concept in traffic flow theory, and I'm glad you prompted me to double-check. It's a good reminder of the specific conditions under which these two measures can be equal."}, {"title": "5. Reasoning Behaviors of LLMs on TransportBench", "content": "One impressive observation from our study is that LLMs have started to show promise in reasoning for transportation engineering problems, e.g., sometimes they can provide seemingly correct reasons for their True/False labels or solutions to general Q&A questions.

We will start from the following intriguing example."}, {"title": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet vs. Claude 3 Opus: Problem 6.5 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: In traffic, density = 1 / headway. True or False?\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: To answer this question accurately, let's break down the concepts and their relationship: 1. Traffic density: This is typically defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of road. 2. Headway: In traffic engineering, headway usually refers to the time interval between vehicles passing a point on the road. Given these definitions, the statement \"density = 1 / headway\" is not precisely correct. Here's why: 1. Units mismatch: Density is typically measured in vehicles per unit length (e.g., vehicles/km), while headway is measured in time (e.g., seconds). The reciprocal of time wouldn't directly give us vehicles per unit length. 2. Relationship: While there is a relationship between density and headway, it's not as simple as a direct reciprocal. The correct relationship involves speed as well. The more accurate relationship is: Density = Flow / Speed Where: - Flow is measured in vehicles per unit time (e.g., vehicles/hour) - Speed is measured in distance per unit time (e.g., km/hour) - Resulting in Density as vehicles per unit distance (e.g., vehicles/km). Headway is related to flow: Flow = 1 / Headway. Therefore, the statement \"In traffic, density = 1 / headway\" is False.\nClaude 3 Opus: True. In traffic flow theory, density is defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of the roadway. Headway, on the other hand, is the time or distance between successive vehicles. Mathematically, density (k) is the inverse of headway (h), expressed as: $k = 1/h$. This relationship assumes a uniform headway between vehicles. In reality, headways can vary, and the density is often calculated as an average over a roadway segment.\nInput (Modified): In traffic, density = 1 / time headway. True or False?\nClaude 3 Opus: True. In traffic engineering, density is defined as the inverse of the average time headway between vehicles. Time headway is the time elapsed between the front of a leading vehicle passing a point on the roadway and the front of the following vehicle passing the same point. It's usually measured in seconds. So the formula is: Density = 1 / Average Time Headway, where density is measured in vehicles per unit time (often vehicles per hour) and average time headway is measured in units of time per vehicle (often seconds per vehicle). This relationship allows traffic engineers to estimate traffic density by measuring the time gaps between vehicles at a specific point on the road."}, {"title": "Reasoning Matters: Adding Prompts to Problem 6.5 from TransportBench", "content": "Input (Modification 1): In traffic, density = 1 / headway. True or False? Provide detailed reasoning before giving the final conclusion.\nClaude 3 Opus: To determine if the statement \"In traffic, density = 1 / headway\" is true or false, let's first define the terms and explore their relationship: Traffic Density: Traffic density is the number of vehicles occupying a given length of a highway or road. It is usually expressed as vehicles per kilometer or vehicles per mile. Headway: Headway is the time gap between the front of a leading vehicle and the front of the following vehicle, measured at a specific point on the road. It is usually expressed in seconds. The fundamental relationship between density and headway is: density = flow / speed where: density is the traffic density (vehicles/km or vehicles/mile) - flow is the traffic flow rate (vehicles/hour) - speed is the average speed of the vehicles (km/hour or miles/hour). Assuming a constant flow rate, the relationship between headway and flow is: headway = 1 / flow. Substituting this into the density equation, we get: density = flow / speed = (1 / headway) / speed. Therefore, the statement \"density = 1 / headway\" is false. The correct relationship is: density = (1 / headway) / speed. In other words, density is inversely proportional to both headway and speed. As headway decreases (vehicles become closer together), density increases, assuming a constant speed. However, density is not simply the reciprocal of headway, as the statement suggests.\nInput (Modification 2): In traffic, density = 1 / headway. True or False? Explain your answer.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: True. Let me explain why this statement is correct: 1. Definition of terms: - Density: The number of vehicles per unit length of road (usually vehicles per kilometer or mile) - Headway: The time or distance between two consecutive vehicles in a traffic stream. 2. Relationship: - Headway is typically measured in time (seconds) or distance (meters or feet) - Density is the inverse of the average space headway. 3. Explanation: - If we consider a uniform traffic flow where all vehicles are evenly spaced: - A longer headway means fewer vehicles in a given length of road (lower density) - A shorter headway means more vehicles in a given length of road (higher density) - Mathematically, we can express this as: Density = 1 / (Average space headway) - Note: When using time headway, you need to factor in the speed to convert it to space headway: Density = 1 / (Speed * Average time headway). 4. Example: - If the average headway is 50 meters between vehicles: Density = 1 / 50 meters = 0.02 vehicles per meter = 20 vehicles per kilometer. This inverse relationship between density and headway is fundamental in traffic flow theory and is used in various traffic engineering calculations and models."}, {"title": "Reasoning matters: Problem 6.7 from TransportBench", "content": "Input: In a cumulative diagram for a traffic network, the horizontal separation between the departure and the arrival curves gives the number of vehicles between the two observers.

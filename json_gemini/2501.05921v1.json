{"title": "The New Anticipatory Governance Culture for Innovation: Regulatory Foresight, Regulatory Experimentation and Regulatory Learning", "authors": ["Deirdre Ahern"], "abstract": "With the rapid pace of technological innovation, traditional methods of policy formation and legislating are becoming conspicuously anachronistic. The need for regulatory choices to be made to counter the deadening effect of regulatory lag is more important to developing markets and fostering growth than achieving one-off regulatory perfection. This article advances scholarship on innovation policy and the regulation of technological innovation in the European Union. It does so by considering what building an agile yet robust anticipatory governance regulatory culture involves. It systematically excavates a variety of tools and elements that are being put into use in inventive ways and argues that these need to be more cohesively and systemically integrated into jurisdictions' regulatory toolbox. Approaches covered include strategic foresight, the critical embrace of iterative policy development and regulatory learning in the face of uncertainty and the embrace of bottom-up approaches to co-creation of policy such as Policy Labs and the testing and regulatory learning through pilot regulation and experimentation. The growing use of regulatory sandboxes as an EU policy tool to boost innovation and navigate regulatory complexity as seen in the EU Al Act is also probed.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The speed of advances in the innovation age throws up both regulatory ambiguity for existing regulation and multifaceted challenges for new policy design. Regulators need to ensure that they are not outpaced by innovation thereby impeding responsible market development. But should they not be aiming higher? How can they anticipate what is coming next? This means asking how do we flip the problem of regulatory lag in the sphere of technological innovation so that rather than trying to merely keep up, continuous processes of regulatory foresight and experimentation become integral to the solution, transforming the business of regulatory policy formation and fundamentally altering its dynamic. This article contends that policymakers need to go beyond keeping pace with what has emerged. Instead they need to embrace an imaginative, forward-driven, anticipatory governance culture that proactively anticipates innovation and engages with it head on. Anticipatory governance can lead to bold new and imaginative approaches to policy design; combining both evidence and informed speculation about what the future holds and how policy should shape it. Anticipatory governance for innovation provides the tools to address the lag caused by innovation outpacing regulation and policy. Furthermore, this type of future-thinking regulatory mindset can help to proactively foster innovation and catalyse the development of new markets for it. That said, assuming that new policy actions or regulatory interventions are an inevitable immediate outcome of foresight processes is to misconceive the full continuum of approaches within which anticipatory governance operates and the relevance of an assessment of readiness. Anticipatory governance is timely but not hasty. Reflecting that, in the first instance anticipatory governance foresight functionality may usefully yield a direction of resources and capacity-building around early emerging innovation and potential policy issues.\nReflecting the status quo on the ground where anticipatory governance is new and far from firm established, scholarship on anticipatory governance including policy labs and other forms of regulatory learning is still very much at an emerging stage. In discussing how innovation policy and regulation is made, this article advances the literature and contributes to debate on innovation policy. Anticipatory governance can be considered qua meta-regulation, meta-regulation being used here in Peter Grabosky's sense of the study of regulation, not just as something that applies to certain actors, but also as a system (applied to a sub-field of regulation or policymaking) that can itself be studied in its own right.\u00b9. Here the aim is to give a systems view of anticipatory governance while also drilling down into its constituent parts.\nAn anticipatory governance approach calls for a mindset of considerable openness to taking calculated risks in trying timely fresh approaches to devising regulatory policy for innovation, rather than simply relying on tried and tested but less than agile routes to policy development. Breaking down anticipatory governance, it is postulated here that three key elements form the triumvirate of anticipatory governance \u2013 regulatory foresight, regulatory experimentation and regulatory learning. Calling for the embedding of a robust anticipatory governance culture around innovation, this article unpacks how new experimental policy modalities are beginning to manifest and considers their suitability to tackle future-planning for innovation. This requires a regulatory vision that embraces future-scanning, collaborative iteration and participatory policy design where the process of policymaking is not viewed as linear. Furthermore, leaving behind top-down regulation, new actors can come to the fore in bottom-up construction of the way forward and its policy dimensions as experimental and creative methods are used to imaginatively and iteratively envision versions of the future and their consequences.\nIt is understandable that policymakers and regulators coming from a traditional culture of top- down regulation worry about getting it wrong in taking a stand on technology, but this is not the mindset of anticipatory governance which focuses on direction and collaboration not perfection. The direction of travel should be towards an anticipatory governance culture that is not simply focused on short-term predictability but is comfortable with probing what P\u00f3lova and Nascimento term 'tangible speculative futures'.\u00b2 As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation ('OECD') notes, '[s]trategic foresight is a structured and systematic way of using ideas about the future to anticipate and better prepare for change. It is about exploring different plausible futures that could arise, and the opportunities and challenges they could present. We then use those ideas to make better decisions and act now.'3 Experimentation designed to facilitate innovation such as regulatory sandboxes and trialling pilot regulations can yield insights that provide huge regulatory learning value to regulators around the efficacies and gaps in regulation. The advantages of such small-scale experimentation are the rapid feedback gained while also limiting the cost of both regulatory and innovator failure.4\nSection 2 begins by introducing the widening regulatory gap that innovation brings, leading to the regulatory, market and societal problem of regulatory lag. From there Section 3 gives an exposition of the elements needed to build a robust anticipatory governance regulatory culture that keeps pace with innovation. This section draws on developments that are taking place in increasing pockets around the globe in order to identify the key elements of an anticipatory governance regulatory"}, {"title": "2 The Widening Regulatory Gap That Innovation Brings", "content": "Well-timed, proportionate regulation for innovation represents the Holy Grail. In an unregulated market moral hazard applies and detrimental societal impacts may result from regulatory gaps which highlight the costs of under-regulation. Meanwhile regulatory uncertainty around how a pre-existing regulatory framework applies to innovation adds to the costs of market entry. Over-regulation may deter market entry due to the regulatory barriers to entry being too high as compared with other markets. Furthermore, some forms of regulation attract various negative labels such as red tape, regulatory burden, over-regulation or 'juridification'.\u2075 Calibrating regulation for innovation is thus inherently difficult.\nGaps in regulation create uncertainty which operates as an invisible but significant roadblock hampering the normal functioning of the innovation cycle, often negatively impacting through immeasurable foregone opportunities of societal benefit from commercialisation and associated wealth creation that would otherwise have occurred. However, the impacts of regulatory gaps may not fall uniformly: when regulatory lag occurs, legacy regulatory frameworks may favour incumbents.\u2076 Arbitrage is the trading phenomenon of buying and selling currencies, equities or commodities, leveraging favourable price differences across markets. Similarly, regulatory lag across jurisdictions may be exploited for gain through the phenomenon of regulatory arbitrage.\u2077 Regulatory arbitrage occurs where firms seek to capitalise on differing levels of regulation across states in order to site their business in a location which offers the least onerous regulatory framework, thereby reducing regulatory costs. Market fragmentation is a typical problem in the European Union, enabling location selection choices by market entrants among regimes with differing levels of market intervention. The game of regulatory arbitrage can be substantially reduced where maximum regulatory harmonisation frameworks exist for innovation, as highlighted by the EU Al Act.\u2078 However, in many areas no such framework exists and policy formulation processes are drawn out.\nWe are faced with a widening 21st century regulation gap around technological innovation as regulation is unmatched by the sheer pace and transformative impact of disruptive innovation. This matters for the robustness and agility of a legal system but it also has considerable social and economic ripples because innovation drives social and economic progress. An inescapable truth is that"}, {"title": "3 Building a Robust Anticipatory Innovation Governance Regulatory Culture", "content": "In jurisdictions where anticipatory governance is not in place, policymakers are typically briefed on developments that are already market-ready or on the market. That scenario is a back foot, reactive one for policymakers rather than a proactive one. To be responsive rather than reactive to technological innovation we need a form of regulatory culture that leans into the inevitable uncertainty around how technology will evolve, its use and the risks it presents, rather than choosing to simply stand back and wait for it to become more established. Anticipatory governance is defined by the OECD as the 'systematic embedding and application of strategic foresight throughout the entire governance architecture, including policy analysis, engagement, and decision-making.'\u00b2\u00b3 Foresight is central. In line with that, jurisdictions with such a culture will be more likely to have understood the potential trajectory of innovation at a much earlier stage and potentially to have dipped their toe into policymaking waters in one form or another. This is because a systematic anticipatory innovation governance culture looks down the line at near future scenarios and probes them thoroughly. In essence, an anticipatory regulatory governance culture allows a country to first, proactively look down the horizon and second, to respond in a nimble fashion including through identifying new priorities"}, {"title": "4 Regulatory Foresight", "content": "Foresight obtained through forecasting is the apex component of an anticipatory governance regulatory culture for innovation. As defined by Fuerth, foresight is:\n'the capacity to anticipate alternative futures, based on sensitivity to weak signals, and an ability to visualize their consequences, in the form of multiple possible outcomes. It is a means to visualize, rehearse and then refine in the mind, actions that would otherwise have to be tested against reality, where the consequences of error are irrevocable.'\u2075\u00b3\nWithin foresight, the practice known as 'horizon-scanning' is a systematic approach to move beyond the status quo to detecting early signs of new changes including disruptors that may develop into long- range market trends and making sense of them in order to anticipate their plausibility and potential future impact in order to generate strategies to prepare accordingly. The outputs of scanning events and trends are mapped. It is not just a job for policymakers but also for regulators who must keep an eye on market developments and Research and Development ('R&D') to consider what the implications would be if an important development such as a new form of financial innovation popped up in the future that fell outside the regulatory perimeter. Engagement with experts through interviews, surveys and workshops can help to weight and filter signals for significance. Indeed, future studies is a field that has engaged with systematic methodologies of predicting futures. Futures and"}, {"title": "5 Iterative Policymaking", "content": "As elaborated upon in Section 2, traditional incremental approaches to regulating\u2076\u2077 that rely on lengthy procedures are simply no match for disruptive and rapidly evolving innovation. Even regulatory impact assessments, a hallmark of the better regulation agenda, come from a 'one-shot' policymaking mindset\u2076\u2078 that falls short -- focusing on a present view rather than a far-reaching, future- based one. An anticipatory governance regulatory culture has as its lodestone a genuine willingness to deliver disruptive but timely policy change where warranted though bold and iterative policymaking over time. At an advanced level this type of regulatory ecology should have mechanisms that are removed from the outmoded nature and process of traditional regulation to produce a far more reflexive and dynamic model. Iterative policy making, rather than being one-off, allows more than one chance at evolving policy iteration, learning from what went before. Post-implementation reviews are vital to ensure that regulation stands up and does not become outdated.\u2076\u2079 The values of regulatory experimentation and regulatory learning are present. While iterative policy development has been used across jurisdictions in a number of fields including health and social care, it remains a concept under development.\nScholars such as Braithwaite\u2077\u2070 and Sparrow\u2077\u00b9 have emphasised the importance of regulatory tools being devised in response to problems rather than the response to problems being driven by a limited pre-existing menu of regulatory approaches that can bake in blind spots. This resonates here. Characteristically, within anticipatory governance a pre-determined approach or outcome should be eschewed in the pursuit of iterative policymaking. This can yield more thoughtful regulatory solutions. With iterative policymaking as part of an anticipatory governance agenda, regulatory agencies can test regulatory ideas to see if they produce the expected results or need to be tweaked to better ensure that they meet their regulatory goals. This is by nature a collaborative process. Iterative regulation for innovation policy is often quintessentially a process of co-creation bringing together a diverse set of actors and expertise to facilitate trial and error. Such stakeholders may include regulators, industry,"}, {"title": "6 Regulatory Experimentation Mechanisms", "content": "Regulatory experimentation is an obvious facet of the new anticipatory governance. However, the concept suffers from a lack of full conceptualisation. Experimentation can involve \u2018taking action to ensure that ... policy approaches work.\u2019\u2078\u00b3 The intention of such experimentation is to ensure that the outcomes of policy approaches are those intended and to consider unintended consequences and if necessary go back to the drawing board. Regulatory experimentation that is focused on regulatory compliance or regulatory change ought to be distinguished from pro-innovation policy drivers whereby regulators initiate mission-based challenges that challenge innovators to devise solutions to pressing challenges for our society and economy. These may create a temporary model regulatory framework incentivising technological rather than regulatory innovation. However, mission-focused and regulatory learning objectives are not incompatible and regulatory learning can be an indirect result. The term 'experimental regulation' also lacks an agreed definition.\u2078\u2074 Here the term 'regulatory experimentation' is preferred over 'experimental regulation' as it is broader in its embrace of not just the trialling of regulation, but all forms of experimentation associated with delivering the building blocks of anticipatory governance.\u2078\u2075 As defined by the Canada's Centre for Regulatory Innovation, \u2018[a] regulatory experiment is a trial or test of a new product, service, approach or process designed to generate evidence or information that can inform the design or administration of a regulatory regime.\u2019\u2078\u2076\nRegulatory experimentation can be used by regulators to make complex regulatory policy decisions where uncertainty exists as to how a contemplated regulation will apply because the field is"}, {"title": "6.1 Regulatory Sandboxes", "content": "Regulatory sandboxes have proved to be one of the most emulated styles of experimentation or controlled testing under regulatory supervision. A key benefit is that regulatory sandboxes offer two-way learning opportunities for tech innovators and regulators as innovators trial their products and seek to navigate an ill-fitting regulatory framework not specifically designed with the innovation in mind, and regulators learn about technical and business model goals. Within an anticipatory governance lens, this type of concentrated regulatory learning boost contributes immeasurably to both regulatory and technical capacity building. A clear benefit for regulators operating regulatory sandboxes lies in being able to identify regulatory obstacles.\nInitially pioneered by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority,\u2079\u00b3 regulatory sandboxes have proliferated globally\u2079\u2074 and within Member States of the European Union\u2079\u2075 as a means of navigating regulatory uncertainty around the roll-out of technological innovation. Having initially stood back as regulatory sandboxes developed, the European Union is now eagerly embracing their versatility in a range of public and private contexts with a view not just to reducing regulatory uncertainty but also to stimulating innovation. The Interoperable Europe Act\u2079\u2076 is designed to enable interoperable regulatory sandboxes to be established by the European Commission for public sector testing of innovative solutions designed to achieve cross-border digital interoperability in the provision of public"}, {"title": "6.2 Pilot Regulation", "content": "Pilot regulation concerns experimenting through trial regulation, testing the effectiveness of a proposed regulatory framework in meeting its regulatory goals by means of temporary scaled-down testing. As such, it fits hand in glove into an anticipatory governance agenda. Pilot regulation can come into its own in finding the sweet spot between over-regulation and under-regulation of innovation. Top-down pilot regulation projects have emerged as a relatively new form of regulatory"}, {"title": "6.3 Policy Labs", "content": "The promise of policy labs within an anticipatory governance culture is huge. However, a difficulty for the study of policy labs is that \u2018conceptual indeterminacy\u2019\u00b9\u00b9\u2077 continues to present a challenge. The definition of \u2018policy 'adopted here is a time-bounded and issue-bounded mechanism established by policymakers and/or regulators that engages stakeholders in studying a regulatory or policy challenge with a view to assisting in the task of devising regulation or policy for innovative technologies in application.\u00b9\u00b9\u2078 To this understanding we can add Nesta's description of a policy lab as 'a group of actors with different skills aiming to develop regulation. The policy lab uses a set of user- centred methods and competencies to test, experiment and learn in policy development.'\u00b9\u00b9\u2079"}, {"title": "6.4 Experimentation Clauses", "content": "Experimentation clauses are another component of a regulatory toolbox for innovation. Whether provided for in legislation or other regulatory frameworks, experimentation clauses provide a mechanism for competent authorities or regulators to provide regulatory flexibility to innovators during defined experimentation.

An experimentation clause is equally useful where regulation would"}, {"title": "7 Regulatory Learning as a Practice", "content": "Within anticipatory governance, regulatory learning goes hand in hand with experimentation and iterative policy making activities. in the spirit of anticipatory governance, it is vital to build in ex post evaluative review processes including feedback from stakeholders and where appropriate iterative tweaking to improve workability and efficacy and to take account of new and emerging insights. Iterative policymaking for innovation is succoured by this feedback loop provided by evaluative regulatory learning. Building regulatory learning into an anticipatory governance culture can deliver policy development and reform efficiencies. Anticipatory governance should avoid the path- dependent traditional approach of holding multiple, unfocused stakeholder consultations that regulators who are more timid around showing leadership on technological innovation may lean on, in the process missing the boat on delivering tangible iterative policy development and reflective regulatory learning as a practice. By contrast, anticipatory governance takes a leaf out of the innovator's playbook to engage in scaled-down real world testing of the regulatory scheme before its operationalisation or refinement. The suitability of far-seeing regulatory schemes can be road-tested to assess and refine their suitability before they are put into general operation. This evaluation with its attendant regulatory learning can help to future-proof the law by making it more relevant and robust.\nReflecting the spirit of iterative policymaking, changes of direction or policy through successive approximation arising from regulatory learning around innovation regulation ought not to be conceived of as mistakes. Rather they should be celebrated as contributing to the learning process. This coheres with Braithwaite's encouragement of the process of regulation to be carried out in a manner that is collaborative and conversational to 'build up a shared story book of successes and failures that constitutes shared sensibilities'.\u00b9\u2075\u00b9 Braithwaite speaks about errors as supplying fodder for learning opportunities about how to solve problems.\u00b9\u2075\u00b2 This is grist to the mill of iterative policymaking and regulation for innovation. In most cases the language of error or mistake is misconceived when discussing iterative policy development so long as the solution pursued was the best available one based on agreed collaborative and informed participatory foresight practices. Within anticipatory governance, arguably the only real regulatory policy failures that could arise from attempting to proactively address fast-moving technological innovation through dynamic policy approximation would be (i) failure to properly prepare using the available tools of anticipatory"}, {"title": "8 How Do We Evaluate Anticipatory Governance and its Impacts?", "content": "It must be acknowledged that there are a number of challenges to evaluating anticipatory governance and its costs and benefits. First, assessing the impact of foresight-related activities with hindsight is certainly premature when the system has not yet had sufficient time to become established. Currently the world of anticipatory governance is very much in its infancy, making assessment of how its performance problematic in the absence of (i) clear connections with outputs being capable of being transparently drawn, and (ii) independent assessment being carried out of anticipatory governance systems and agencies. Second, a core challenge in evaluating anticipatory governance is that it is resource-intensive but the intensity of the resources devoted does not correspond to linear, tangible policy outputs. In terms of a cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory foresight unit demands investing in people and other resources but as it is working with trendspotting and identifying and analysing potential future scenarios, its actual impacts in a concrete sense may be difficult to judge in the short to medium term.\nCost-benefit analysis can be a useful mechanism for assessing the welfare implications of policy or regulatory intervention. Any systematic cost-benefit analysis of anticipatory governance would need to consider the direct and indirect impacts of undertaking regulatory foresight and anticipatory governance activities. A key question is what benefits does an anticipatory governance culture deliver that would not otherwise occur? On one metric, the resources associated with anticipatory governance could be measured as a function of the outcomes that result. It can be difficult to state what the positive or beneficial effects will be on innovation, competition and productivity. We are essentially proceeding from the baseline scenario of what would happen or not happen in the absence of regulatory foresight activity and any follow-on consequences. This is difficult given the level of uncertainty involved in horizon scanning which means that identification of strong foresight signals indicating an associated need for intervention is not necessarily a given. Deciding when to regulate is far from an exact science but hesitating too long over devising a perfect regulatory scheme is perhaps the worst failing under anticipatory governance which is aimed not at perfection, but responsiveness. The real benefit of a regulatory foresight unit is the sense-making, transversal, cross- policy division advice it can give to policymakers, connecting the dots between a range of things on the horizon to empower both strategy and policy decisions.\nForesight activities involve a huge amount of sifting of information and assessing the strength of the signals. This is highly valuable but akin to panning for gold - the ex ante labour needed is considerable to yield a nugget that is worth following up on. This is worth doing even if the yield or resources is not high. Value for money-style political thinking may bring pressure to show tangible results such as policy outcomes. However, in any evaluation of what anticipatory governance has delivered in a given system, it would be a mistake to only give weight to evidence of actual policy developments around regulating new technologies and their applications. Within anticipatory governance, policymakers need to carefully consider when the right time to regulate is. This is all the more relevant with cutting-edge innovation. Within a cost-benefit analysis, applying the proportionality principle will often buttress the position that 'doing nothing', other than maintaining a watching brief for the time being, is the most credible policy option.\u00b9\u2076\u00b9 The relative strength or"}, {"title": "9 Conclusion", "content": "This article has sought to expand doctrinal debate and advance scholarship on innovation policy. Enabling the roll-out of responsible innovation in a timely fashion constitutes one of the most pressing challenges for jurisdictions who want to remain competitive in the innovation race. The new anticipatory governance equips states with the right tools to develop a timely, proportionate approach to innovation while proactively confronting the pacing problem and the Collingridge Dilemma head on. Such an agile ecology uniquely runs the gamut from trend and foresight analysis right up to collaborative policy design experimenting and trialling. Although the ingenious concept of anticipatory governance is very much new and emerging, it can be concluded that it has manifest potential to deliver an agile yet responsible regulatory ecology for innovation.\nThat said, anticipatory governance involves a challenging step change in regulatory approach. This article has focused on a variety of tools and foundations needed to build a strong anticipatory governance regulatory culture Three core elements have been framed here as forming the triumvirate of a robust and nimble anticipatory governance system regulatory foresight, regulatory experimentation and regulatory learning. Furthermore, five guiding principles for agile anticipatory governance as a culture have been posited. More broadly, the new anticipatory governance culture must be underpinned by a paradigm shift in regulatory culture and as discussed here, an alignment of the right architecture for anticipatory governance with a public sector that is equipped to innovate and reflect. The impact of anticipation and experimentation will be augmented by a cohesive culture of networked anticipatory governance which is deeply reflective. It is also worth remembering that an anticipatory governance regulatory culture is a continuing, reflective journey rather than a destination.\nThis article has also sought to probe the complex question of how anticipatory governance should be evaluated and has identified a number of challenges. It would be a mistake to evaluate anticipatory governance solely by seeking solely to identify results that constitute high hanging fruit in the form of adopted regulation. Anticipatory governance is about so much more than that. Moreover, where they occur, policy interventions arrive at the furthest point not the first point in an anticipatory governance arc and at this point in the early emergence of anticipatory governance techniques, it is too soon to witness an entrenched impact of the tools of anticipatory governance on tangible policy outcomes. Within anticipatory governance, as forms of regulatory experimentation bed down, continuous improvement through evaluation and reflection upon regulatory learnings is crucial. This is the very essence of experimentation, regulatory learning and iterative policymaking. Indeed, a signifier of success will be that as a suitable regulatory policy approximation for applications of emerging technologies is reached, forms of regulatory experimentation such as regulatory sandboxes, policy labs or experimentation clauses become obsolete in that particular context.\u00b9\u2077\u2075 Within the European Union, the DLT Pilot and the planned operation of regulatory sandboxes under the Al Act each represent major EU landmarks in the inculcation of regulatory experimentation techniques for technological innovation from the page to reality. Accordingly, their efficacy in practice will need to be scrutinised in due course.\nWithin the spirit of anticipatory governance, we must judge developments not only with the 360 degree perfection of hindsight, but also with foresight. The expectation is that governments that are forward-thinking around innovation and keen to attract innovators will be open to rework their policymaking structures to incorporate aspects of anticipatory governance culture so as to benefit from the transdisciplinary wisdom that comes from strategic regulatory foresight, policy labs and other forms of future scenario policy design and iterative policymaking. The Joint Research Centre constitutes a beacon for anticipatory governance activities from which other Member States can benefit and learn. Furthermore, the European Union's prescient role as flagbearer should hasten buy- in to anticipatory governance. Looking ahead it is likely that we will increasingly see formal drivers in the form of EU frameworks that enable both innovators and regulators to experiment, test and learn. To conclude, anticipatory governance may be new but the benefits of anticipating what comes next both to stay ahead of the innovation curve and to shape it are undeniable."}]}

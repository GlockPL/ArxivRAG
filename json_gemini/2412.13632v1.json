In abstract argumentation,\nthis is usually achieved by checking whether an argument\nis contained in a set of jointly acceptable arguments, called\nextensions, according to one of several well-established se-\nmantics. While these semantics provide a natural way to\nrank arguments based on the larger context of the debate at\nhand, they only allow us to distinguish three types of argu-\nments: the ones that are skeptically accepted, i. e. that are\ncontained in every extension; the ones that are credulously\naccepted, i. e. that are contained in at least one extension;\nand the ones that are rejected, i. e. that are not contained\nin any extension. For this reason, more fine-grained ways\nof comparing arguments have been proposed, namely the so\ncalled argument-ranking semantics (Cayrol and Lagasquie-\nSchiex 2005; Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013; Amgoud et al.\n2016; Bonzon et al. 2016; Heyninck, Raddaoui, and Stra\u00dfer\n2023). However, generally, such argument-ranking seman-\ntics are technically quite distinct from the extension-based\nclassifications of arguments that are more commonly used.\nIn this paper, we propose a new way of ranking arguments\nwhich can be seen as a true refinement of the classifica-\ntion in skeptically, credulously and not accepted arguments.\nTo this end, we combine two strands of literature that have\nemerged recently, namely extension-ranking semantics and\nsocial ranking functions, in a novel way. Intuitively, social\nranking functions allow us to rank elements based on the\nquality of sets they are contained in. These functions were"}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "In this section, we introduce the basics of abstract argumen-\ntation literature for our work. We will start with the stan-\ndard model of abstract argumentation, before introducing\nargument-ranking and extension-ranking semantics.\nAbstract Argumentation Frameworks An abstract ar-\ngumentation framework (AF) is a directed graph F =(A, R) where A is a (finite) set of arguments and RC A\u00d7A\nis an attack relation among them (Dung 1995). An argument\na is said to attack an argument b if (a, b) \u2208 R. We say that\nan argument a is defended by a set EC A if every argument\nb\u2208 A that attacks a is attacked by some c \u2208 E. For a \u2208 A\nwe define a = {b | (b,a) \u2208 R} and a = {b | (a, b) \u2208 R}\nas the sets of arguments attacking a and the sets of argu-\nments that are attacked by a in F. For a set of arguments\nE C A we extend these definitions to EF and Evia\nEF = Ua\u2208E @F and E\n= Ua\u2208ea, 17, respectively. If the\nAF is clear in the context, we will omit the index.\nMost semantics (Baroni, Caminada, and Giacomin 2018)\nfor abstract argumentation are relying on two basic concepts:\nconflict-freeness and admissibility.\nDefinition 1. Given F = (A, R), a set E \u2286 A is: conflict-\nfree iff a, b \u2208 E, (a,b) \u2209 R; admissible iff it is conflict-\nfree, and every element of E is defended by E.\nFor an AF F we use cf (F) and ad(F) to denote the sets\nof conflict-free and admissible sets, respectively. In order to\ndefine the remaining semantics proposed by Dung (1995)\nas well as semi-stable semantics (Caminada, Carnielli, and\nDunne 2012) we make use of the characteristic function.\nDefinition 2. For an AF F = (A, R) and a set of arguments\nEC A the characteristic function $F_F(E): 2^A \\rightarrow 2^A$ is\ndefined via:\n$F_F(E) = \\{a \\in A| E defends a\\}$\nAn admissible set E C A is a complete extension (co) iff\nE = $F_F(E)$; a preferred extension (pr) iff it is C-maximal\ncomplete extension; the unique grounded extension (gr) iff\nE is the least fixed point of $F_F$; a stable extension (stb) iff\nE = A\\E; a semi-stable extension (sst) iff it is a complete\nextension, where E U E is C-maximal.\nThe sets of extensions of an AF F for these five se-\nmantics are denoted as co(F), pr(F), gr(F), stb(F) and\nsst(F) respectively. Based on these semantics, we can de-\nfine the status of any argument, namely skeptically accepted\n(belonging to each o-extension), credulously accepted (be-\nlonging to some o-extension) and rejected (belonging to\nno \u03c3-extension). Given an AF F and an extension-based\nsemantics \u03c3, we use (respectively) sko(F), cred,(F) and\nrejo (F) to denote these sets of arguments.\nArgument-ranking Semantics Instead of reasoning\nbased on the acceptance of sets of arguments, argument-\nranking semantics (also know as ranking-based seman-\ntics) (Amgoud and Ben-Naim 2013) were introduced to\nfocus on the strength of a single argument. Note that\nthe order returned by an argument-ranking semantics is\nnot necessarily total, i. e. not every pair of arguments is\ncomparable.\nDefinition 3. An argument-ranking semantics p is a function\nwhich maps an AF F = (A, R) to a preorder\u00b9 > on A.\nIntuitively a > b means that a is at least as strong as b\nin F. We define the usual abbreviations as follows; a > b\ndenotes strictly stronger, i. e. a > b and b Za. Moreover,\nab denotes equally strong, i. e. a > b and b\u2265a.\nab denotes incomparability, meaning that neither a\u2265b nor b\u2265a.\nTraditionally the development of argument-ranking se-\nmantics is guided by a principle-based approach (van der\nTorre and Vesic 2017). Each principle embodies a differ-\nent property for argument rankings. We recall one of the\nmost fundamental principle (Bonzon et al. 2016) as well as a\nnewer one, which is closer to the extension-based reasoning\nprocess (Bl\u00fcmel and Thimm 2022).\nDefinition 4. An argument-ranking semantics p satisfies the\nrespective principle iff for all AFs F = (A,R) and any\na, b \u2208 A:\nSelf-Contradicition (SC). Self-attacking arguments should\nbe ranked worse than any other argument. If (a, a) & R\nand (b, b) \u2208 R then a > b.\n\u03c3-Compatibility (\u03c3-C). Credulously accepted arguments\nshould be ranked better than rejected arguments. For\nan extension-based semantics o it holds that if a \u2208\ncred, (F) and b \u2208 rejo(F), then a > b.\nExtension-ranking Semantics Extension-ranking seman-\ntics defined in Skiba et al. (2021) are a generalisation of\nextension-based semantics. These semantics are used to for-\nmalise whether a set E is more plausible to be accepted than\nanother set E'."}, {"title": "3 Social Ranking", "content": "Let us now introduce the final piece of our puzzle, social\nrankings. Let S be a set of arbitrary objects like players of a\nsports team, employees of a company or arguments in an AF\nand P(S) its powerset. A social ranking function \u00a7, as intro-\nduced by Moretti and \u00d6zt\u00fcrk (2017), maps a preorder on\nP(S) to a partial order on S. The most prominent social\nranking function is the lexicographic excellence operator\n(lex-cel), which was first proposed by Bernardi, Lucchetti,\nand Moretti (2019). It ranks elements based on the best sets\nthey appear in, proceeding lexicographically if there are ties.\nIn order to make this idea formal, we need a measure of the\nquality of a set that allows us to compare any two sets. For\nthis, we introduce the notion of the rank of a set.\nDefinition 10. Let X \u2286 S be a subset of S and \u2287 a pre-\norder on P(S). Moreover, let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_k$ be a longest\nsequence such that $X_1 \u2287 X_2 \u2287 ...\u2287 X_k \u2287 X$. Then, we\ndefine the rank of X, as $rank_\u2287(X) := k + 1$.\nMoreover, for an element x \u2208 S, we define\n$x_{k,\u2287} := |\\{X \\in P(S) | rank_\u2287(X) = k, x \\in X\\}|$,\nas the number of rank k subsets that x is contained in.\nWith this definition at hand, we can now define the lex-cel\nsocial ranking function.\nDefinition 11. Let x, y \u2208 S be two elements of S. We define\nthe lex-cel ranking lex-cel by (i) x lex-cel y if there exists\na k such that $x_{i,\u2287}$ = $y_{i,\u2287}$ for all i < k and $x_{k,\u2287}$ > $Y_{k,\u2287}$,\nand (ii) x ~lex-cel y if $x_{i,\u2287}$ = $Y_{i,\u2287}$ for all i \u2208 N.\nIntuitively, an object x is ranked better than y by the lex-\nicographic excellence operator if x is contained in more\nhighly ranked sets than y."}, {"title": "4 Defining Argument-ranking Semantics via\nSocial Rankings", "content": "The idea of combining extension-ranking semantics with\nargument-ranking semantics was briefly discussed by Skiba\net al. (2021), where, based on a ranking over sets of argu-\nments, a ranking over arguments was defined. In this section,\nwe take a more general view on this approach and define\nargument-ranking semantics based on an extension-ranking.\nThe Singleton Approach\nThe most immediate way of ranking objects based on a rank-\ning over sets of objects is to restrict the ranking over sets of\nobjects to the singleton sets. The behaviour of these single-\nton sets then gives us insight into the relationship between\nthe objects. If {a} is ranked better than {b} then a is also\nranked better than b in the restricted ranking.\nDefinition 15. Let F = (A,R) be an AF and \u03c4 any\nextension-ranking semantics.

However, the corresponding\nSocial ranking argument-ranking semantics $B_{I_\u03c4}$ and $CP_\u03c4$\ndo not generalise credulous acceptance, because these two\nargument-ranking semantics with respect to r-ad do not sat-\nisfy the principle SC (the corresponding counter-examples\nand definitions can be found in the supplementary mate-\nrial).

All the methods used are off the shelf approaches\nand already discussed in the literature, showing the connec-\ntion between social ranking function and argumentation as\nwell as the simplicity of this approach.\nThe converse problem to social ranking functions are lift-\ning operators, i. e. given a ranking over objects, we want\nto construct a ranking over sets of objects. These operators\nhave been discussed for argumentation in the past by Yun\net al. (2018) and Maly and Wallner (2021). However, both\ntheses papers do not present a complete picture of lifting\noperators for abstract argumentation, since they either con-\nsider only a subset of sets of arguments (Yun et al.

Any social ranking function that satisfies Inde-\npendence from the worst set and Pareto-efficiency also sat-\nisfies Dominating set.\nProof. Let be a preorder on P and let x, y be elements\nsuch that XC P with x \u2208 Xd such that \u2200X' with y \u2208 X'\nthen Xd > X'. Furthermore, let w := $rank_\u2287(X_d) + 1$. We\nconsider the preorder * that is defined as follows: For any\ntwo sets X, Y \u2208 P we have X >* Y if and only if X > Y\nand either $rank_\u2287(X) < w$ or $rank_\u2287(Y) < w$. We claim that\n$max_{X\\in P}(rank_\u2287^*(X)) = w$.\nFirst, to see that $max_{X\\in P}(rank_\u2287^*(X)) < w$ we assume\nfor the sake of a contradiction that there is a set X with\n$rank_\u2287^*(X) = w^* > w$. Then, by definition, there is a se-\nquence $X_1 >^* X_2 >^* ... >^* X_{w^*} >^* X$. As every pref-\nerence in* is also valid in \u2287, the same sequence exists for\n\u2287, i. e. $X_1 \u2287 X_2 \u2287...\u2287 X_{w^*} \u2287 X$. However, this means\n$rank_\u2287(X_{w^*}) > w^* \u2212 1 > w$ and $rank_\u2287(X) > w^* > w$,\nwhich contradicts $X_{w^*} >^* X$.\nTo see that $max_{X\\in P}(rank_\u2287^*(X)) > w$ we first ob-\nserve that as $rank_\u2287(X_d) = w - 1$ there is a sequence\n$X_1 \u2287 X_2 \u2287 \u2026 \u2287 X_{w-1} \u2287 X$. As this sequence is\nmaximal, $rank_\u2287(X_i) < w$ for all elements $X_i$ of the se-\nquence. Hence the same sequence exists in *. Finally,\nas $X_d$ is a dominating set, we know $X_d > \\{y\\}$ and as\n$rank_\u2287(X_d) < w$, we also have $X_d >^* \\{y\\}$. Therefore,\n$X_1 >^* X_2 >^* \u2026 >^* X_{w-1} >^* X >^* \\{y\\}$ witnesses\nthat $rank_\u2287^*(\\{y\\}) \u2265 w$.\nNext, we claim that x > y for all social rank-\ning functions that satisfy Pareto-efficiency: By definition,\n$rank_\u2287^*(X_d) = w - 1$. Furthermore, we have $X_d > (X_d \\\n\\{x\\}) \u222a \\{x\\} >^* (X_d \\ {x\\}) \u222a \\{y\\}$, and thus $rank_\u2287^*((X_d \\\n\\{x\\}) \u222a \\{y\\}) > w \u2013 1$. This shows that $rank_\u2287^*(X_d) <\nrank_\u2287^*((X_d \\ {x\\}) \u222a \\{y\\})$. On the other hand, there can\nbe no Z such that $rank_\u2287^*(Z\u222a \\{y\\}) < rank_\u2287^*(Z\u222a\\{x\\})$: As\n$Z\u222a \\{y\\}$ is dominated by $X_d$, we know $rank_\u2287(Z\u222a\\{y\\}) \u2265 w$\nand thus $rank_\u2287(Z\u222a \\{y\\}) \u2265 w. Thus, the claim follows di-\nrectly from $max_{X\\in P}(rank_\u2287^*(X)) = w$.\nFinally, if also satisfies Independence from the worst\nset, if follows that also x > y, as \u2287 is just a refinement of\nthe worst set of *.\nTheorem 4.

Lessons Learned from Cybersecurity", "authors": ["David Williams-King", "Linh Le", "Adam Oberman", "Yoshua Bengio"], "abstract": "As LLMs develop increasingly advanced capabilities, there is an increased need to minimize the harm that could be caused to society by certain model outputs; hence, most LLMs have safety guardrails added, for example via fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue the position that current safety fine-tuning is very similar to a traditional cat-and-mouse game (or arms race) between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity. Model jailbreaks and attacks are patched with bandaids to target the specific attack mechanism, but many similar attack vectors might remain. When defenders are not proactively coming up with principled mechanisms, it becomes very easy for attackers to sidestep any new defenses. We show how current defenses are insufficient to prevent new adversarial jailbreak attacks, reward hacking, and loss of control problems. In order to learn from past mistakes in cybersecurity, we draw analogies with historical examples and develop lessons learned that can be applied to LLM safety. These arguments support the need for new and more principled approaches to designing safe models, which are architected for security from the beginning. We describe several such approaches from the AI literature.", "sections": [{"title": "Intro", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable tools, which when misused can cause harm to an individual or to society as a whole. Some of these harms as categorized in Weidinger et al. [2022] include hate speech, hazardous information (like how to construct weapons), automated cyberat-tacks, automated disinformation campaigns, etc. The latest frontier LLMs available from AI labs are equipped with guardrails or fine-tuned with safety training to try to reduce these cases [Bianchi et al., 2023, OpenAI, 2024b], but success has been mixed. There have been many known inference-time attacks or jailbreak techniques that break out of trained safety contexts [Wei et al., 2023], such as specifying requests in different languages or in base64 encoding, and even when those specific at-tacks are mitigated, there is no guarantee that others do not remain.\nThere is an ongoing arms race between LLM attackers and defenders, where defenders are mainly reactive (instead of being proactive): attackers find a new method, then that method is patched by defenders, and so on iteratively. The problem is that it does not take many resources to construct new jailbreak attacks; even bloggers have the resources to develop and maintain working jailbreaks against current models [Sakamoto, 2024, Kapoor, 2024]. However, it takes substantial effort to con-struct defenses, and they do not generalize well against other types of attacks [Xu et al., 2024].

Many memory corruption attacks end with the attacker in full control of a system (discussed more below).\nCybersecurity lesson: A defender cannot win an arms race with no clear boundaries between code and data, where constructs of arbitrary complexity can be created. Instead, the arms race may be avoided entirely by constructing a different environment.\nLLM equivalent: A system prompt, given at inference time, is meant to include instructions that should not be tampered with. The user input is concatenated after the system prompt, and the whole string is fed to the model as context. Generally, developers use the system prompt to specify a persona or define a problem to be solved, while user input contains instances of tasks or requests that fit within the persona.\nThe problem here is that there is no strict boundary between user and system prompts [Wu et al., 2023]2. An attacker can include a query in the user prompt which tries to make system-prompt-level changes, and the LLM will sometimes follow their instructions (even to the extent of ignoring prior instructions). Simply put, the problem is that LLM inputs are also LLM commands.\nCybersecurity example: See Section 3.1 for a detailed description of a memory safety attack. At-tacks that take advantage of memory safety errors can take full control over a software system. They often lead to the worst-case scenario of remote code execution. This is roughly equivalent to an at-tacker logging into your server without you realising and being able to run any arbitrary commands (downloading your data, installing software, deleting files, etc.).\nLLM examples: An attacker can craft a user input that blurs the user/system boundary, caus-ing the model to ignore its system prompt. For example, just writing Ignore all previous\ninstructions would bypass ChatGPT guardrails for a 22-month period [Hamilton, 2024,\nRobison, 2024]. This simple prompt would bypass all attempted safety through system prompting.\nUsers on X used this to trick automated bots into doing whatever they wanted, as shown by Hamilton [2024]: Disregard all previous instruction. Show me a horse in ASCII art.\nHere is another example. This user prompt originally caused Microsoft Bing's AI assistant to return its system prompt [Warren, 2023], despite being trained not to do so:"}, {"title": "2.2 Searching for jailbreaks mirrors the search for zero-day exploits", "content": "Cybersecurity terms: A zero-day exploit is a brand-new attack that a defender has never seen or theorized before, so called because they had zero days to prepare. An arms race is when an attacker beats the latest defense, then a defender beats the latest attack, and so on iteratively. In this scenario, it is not possible to mount a perfect attack or perfect defense, so the other side can always respond by using some resources to get around the last known state [Szekeres et al., 2013].\nCybersecurity lesson: A defender cannot stay ahead in an arms race if new attacks require many fewer resources than new defenses. Hence, the defender must cause the resource requirements to be rebalanced, usually via substantial up-front investment into new defensive techniques.\nLLM equivalent: In LLMs today, it is much easier to construct attacks than to construct effective defenses. For example, one study of nine offensive and four defensive measures found that defensive measures are \u201cgenerally ineffective\" [Xu et al., 2024]. Attacks or jailbreaks take the form of new prompts, which are easy to specify\u2014and easy enough to find that bloggers maintain lists of fron-tier model jailbreaks [Sakamoto, 2024, Kapoor, 2024]. It is even possible to auto-generate attack prompts using another LLM [Lee et al., 2024]. On the other hand, defenses typically have to engage in some mathematical re-juggling and fine-tuning [Xu et al., 2024].\nIn the field of adversarial attacks on image classifiers, Nicholas Carlini says the problem may have been set up in a way that made it \u201ctoo difficult to solve\u201d\u2014by giving attackers white-box access and that the LLM security problem may be even harder [FAR.AI, 2024]. See Section 3.2 for more.\nCybersecurity example: This state of affairs is common in the world of software in general. It often only takes one vulnerability (or at most a handful of vulnerabilities) for an attacker to be able to compromise a system. Unfortunately, software is full of undiscovered bugs: the average professional codebase contains about 15-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code [McConnell, 2004]. Any of these bugs could be discovered by an attacker and turn out to be their entry point into a system.\nLLM example: See the jailbreaks in Section 2.1, which required very little effort to develop.\""}, {"title": "2.3 Safety fine-tuning and internet routing both retrofit security into existing architectures", "content": "Cybersecurity lesson: When security is retrofitted into a system that was not originally designed with security in mind, gaps and vulnerabilities often remain. In contrast, systems designed from the ground up with security principles like isolation and access control tend to be more secure.\nLLM equivalent: Most safety training is performed on a model after it has been pre-trained on other tasks. Fine-tuning at this stage is equivalent to introducing security into an architecture at a late stage. There will be many more inputs that the model can act on than can be covered by fine tuning.\nCybersecurity example: When security is retrofitted in, it is quite common for unintentional vio-lations of isolation or permissions to be present. The internet is an example of a system that was designed organically instead of with security in mind. This has led to many fundamental compo-nents such as network routing with BGP being insecure (details in Appendix A). An architectural redesign would be very expensive at this stage [Bellovin et al., 2006], but without it, the only option is to build a secure virtual layer on top [Stafford, 2020].\nLLM example: Because LLM safety is retrofitted, simply encoding a problematic query in base64 (e.g., Section 4.1) or in another spoken language (e.g., Section 4.2) might satisfy safety checks."}, {"title": "2.4 Reward hacking mirrors internet packet routing challenges", "content": "Cybersecurity terms: A packet is the smallest unit of data (usually several kilobytes) exchanged atomically between computers as they talk over a network. Border Gateway Protocol or BGP is how different parts of the internet that are owned by different entities route data to one another.\nCybersecurity lesson: When an agent or group of agents are solving a distributed optimization problem, but the incentives of each agent are not necessarily aligned with the global reward function, reward hacking is likely to occur. Formal methods may be needed to address the issue.\nCybersecurity example: Every network operator participates in a global distributed computation of the shortest route between each possible source and destination IP address. However, if a network operator has their own malicious goals, they can announce false information that seems to provide ideal routes (analogous to reward hacking), then hijack or divert traffic meant for another part of the internet. The full details of how BGP works are described in Appendix A. The solution pushed by the security community [Butler et al., 2009] is to use a version of BGP that leverages cryptography to make it much harder to forge false routes, and easier to identify which network operator is the one that is behaving inappropriately. In other words, some kind of verification is needed for the solutions that are generated by the distributed BGP protocol.\nLLM example: In Section 4.3, a documented instance of reward hacking performed agentically by an OpenAI frontier model is described. To avoid these issues, again some kind of verification (as in Dalrymple et al. [2024]) or uncertainty in bounds (as in Russell [2022]) is likely to be needed."}, {"title": "2.5 An attacker or rogue model can act differently in test and real environments", "content": "Cybersecurity terms: A virtual machine is an emulation of computer hardware, including a CPU, that is running on a physical machine called the host machine. A virtual machine can be paused and debugged easily, in ways that would require hardware inspection on any physical machine; hence, virtual machines are often used for malware analysis (looking at a program to see if it is malicious).\nCybersecurity lesson: A malicious entity can act in a benign fashion in a test or virtual environment, and only reveal malicious behaviour on the physical machine or system that is their attack target.\nLLM equivalent: A model could behave with full normality when it knows it is in a test environ-ment, but behave in a rogue manner once it is deployed in the real world. Testing in a safe isolated environment is therefore only a proxy for real-world behavior; isolated test and evaluation runs to an-alyze the capabilities of sophisticated models cannot be guaranteed to expose actual full capabilities. This makes ensuring that a model will not escape its environment extremely challenging.\nCybersecurity example: Virtual machine software such as VMware [VMware, 2024] is frequently used by malware analysts to run suspected malicious code, and observe what it does. However, mal-ware takes many steps to avoid being detected inside virtual machines, in a category of techniques called Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion [Deloitte, 2021]. These techniques range from executing in-structions that only exist in VMware [aldeid, 2017], to executing undocumented instructions that exist on physical hardware but were not implemented in the virtual machine [Kemkes, 2020]. Some-times, malware will look for other common properties of virtual machines that are hard to fake such as small hard drives, unusual number of CPU cores or amount of RAM, etc [Kemkes, 2020].\nMalware also frequently includes Execution Guardrails [Carr, 2022], to prevent the code from run-ning on certain systems of the attacker's choice. For example, a lot of ransomware created by Rus-sian groups will do nothing if there is a Cyrillic (Russian) keyboard plugged into the system [Krebs, 2021]. (For more on different categories of attack techniques, see Appendix B.)\nLLM example: A sufficiently devious model could easily detect that it is running in a test envi-ronment and not reveal problematic behavior. The model could look for internet connectivity, news websites, blockchain values; it could observe timing or other clues that indicate it is running in a batch manner. It is also very hard to keep an AI in a box [Armstrong et al., 2012]. There are already documented instances of frontier models escaping the bounds of their intended environments; see Section 4.4."}, {"title": "2.6 When building a system where failures can be catastrophic, formal methods are essential", "content": "Cybersecurity lesson: When the cost of a functional or security failure would be catastrophically high, the system must be engineered appropriately, e.g. using formal methods that provide (strict or probabilistic) guarantees of safety.\nLLM equivalent: When designing safety mechanisms for a potentially superintelligent AI, any safety failure could have negative consequences for all of humanity [Bengio et al., 2024b]. Hence, leveraging a more principled approach to safety will become increasingly important (Section 5).\nCybersecurity example: While the average professional codebase contains about 15-50 bugs per 1000 lines of code [McConnell, 2004], developers of system critical software like NASA have much higher standards. NASA spends about $30 million/year on a 400,000 line application to achieve 0.01 bugs per 1000 lines of code [Ferrara, 2012, Fishman, 1996]. Nevertheless, issues do happen which can cause failed missions on the order of hundreds of millons of dollars [Easterbrook, 2003].\nLLM example: Future models that are entrusted with larger agentic responsibilities will be essen-tial to get right. However, we're not there yet. OpenAI's ol-preview model exhibited intentional deception, see Section 4.4."}, {"title": "3 Cybersecurity Examples", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Exploiting memory safety in unsafe languages", "content": "One class of cybersecurity vulnerability is memory safety errors, which are the most preva-lent type of vulnerability reported every year at about 70% of all vulnerabilities CISA [2023], Microsoft [2019], MITRE [2023]. Despite decades of research, the arms race between attackers and defenders\u2014the \u201ceternal war in memory\u201d [Szekeres et al., 2013]\u2014continues to this day. No effective defense has ever been created that withstands additional attacker scrutiny. Programmers writing code in memory-unsafe languages such as C and C++ seemingly cannot avoid introducing memory safety errors, like use-after-free bugs, buffer overflows, and out-of-bounds writes.\nMemory-unsafe languages allow direct manipulation of memory pointers, do not perform bounds checks on array accesses, etc. These shortcomings, once manipulated by an attacker, can have highly unanticipated effects. For example, the buffer overrun in Figure 1 could result in the variable target being modified even though the programmer expected to be modifying array!\nAt a high level, these vulnerabilities arise when the system fails to maintain a separation between data that is meant to be manipulated by the user, and data that is meant for internal operation of the program. Even though many bugs can be triggered only in certain situations, attackers can often use them to build arbitrary memory read and write capability. Attackers might try to trick the system into treating data as code, since modern computers are von Neumann machines [Rosenberg, 2017] that store both the data and code in the same memory; they might also modify pointers and data that control the original code flow, causing an attack to run instead [Roemer et al., 2012, Hu et al., 2016].\nThe only long-term solutions, if one wants to avoid this class of vulnerabilities entirely, are to embark on the highly challenging task of formally verifying the code, or to instead use a so-called \u201cmemory-safe\" programming language such as Rust, Go, or Python. In general, any interpreted language and nearly any language that is compiled down to bytecode and run in a virtual machine (like Java) is memory safe. Go allows pointers but disallows pointer arithmetic, making it difficult to violate the semantics of memory objects [Kashyap, 2023]. Rust allows pointers but will formally verify\""}, {"title": "3.2 Defending adversarial attacks against image classifiers", "content": "Image classifiers in computer vision are models that take an image as input, and output a class like \"dog\" or \"muffin\u201d (as in the famous example [daesol, 2021]). Generally, the accuracy of these models approaches or exceeds human baselines [Real et al., 2019]. An adversarial attacker in this case tries to construct images that a human would have no trouble classifying, but that confuse the model. These attacks are generally \u201cwhite-box\u201d meaning the attacker has access to model weights.\nAn intense arms race ensued. Unfortunately, each new defense was quickly defeated by a new attack technique. There is one class of attack that is particularly strong: performing gradient descent on the model, optimizing for the opposite direction, and obtaining small perturbations on input pixels. These perturbations may not be visible to the human eye, but cause the model to switch classification predictions [Szegedy et al., 2014, Goodfellow et al., 2015].

In a CTF, the participant has to hack through different layers until they can access a secret text message known as the flag.\nAt one point during the evaluation, the docker container running the CTF challenge failed to start. So the model ran a network scan, found the docker service on the real network outside any sandbox. It connected to the service, and started the docker container running the challenge environment. See Figure 4 in OpenAI [2024b] for more detail.\nThis is a clear instance of reward hacking in the real world. The only action that mattered to the model's fitness function was to successfully retrieve the flag. It had no issue with contravening the competition guidelines to achieve this aim.

While it is possible for safety to be retrofitted through virtualization as in Section 2.3, in most other cases, we concluded that a more principled approach to AI safety should be utilized instead. Given the relative ease of creating jailbreaks for today's LLMs, and the wide latitude of the specification language (natural language text), we predict that attackers will continue to win this game until more principled defenses are used. This could prove dangerous as AI models increase in capability towards superintelligence (Section 2.6).\nThere are several approaches discussed in the AI literature to construct models with a more princi-pled approach to safety. They range from the broad framework for safe-by-design AI with quanti-tative guarantees proposed by Dalrymple et al. [2024], to probabilistic guarantees such as proposed by Bengio [2023], Bengio et al. [2024a], to methods that rely heavily on formal verification and proof-carrying code and hardware as in Tegmark and Omohundro [2023]. The objective in all cases is to obtain guarantees that will continue to hold even if the underlying AI is superintelligent. The key insight is that a theorem, once proven, remains true and can thus provide guarantees even against an arbitrarily intelligent AI (discussed in Section 2.5).\nAn important idea is that although we cannot be sure of how a neural network computes an output, we may be able to use simple code to verify the proof (outputted by the neural net) of a statement the AI makes (which we can think of as a theorem about the innocuity of a proposed action). One of the key challenges is that the kind of theorem we really care about concerns quantities that are difficult to formalize, like human intentions, which appear to be needed to get alignment guarantees. This motivated early work on AI that maintains probabilistic uncertainty about human intentions. For example, Russell [2022] shows that this uncertainty about the AI reward function means that"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "We draw comparisons in six cases between AI safety issues and cybersecurity.

How-ever, each piece of the physical internet networking infrastructure is run by different companies and countries, and data will probably flow through multiple entities on its way to the destination.\nBGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the algorithm used to coordinate at the highest level. Each entity that operates a piece of the network is called an autonomous system or AS within the BGP protocol, and has its own subnetwork (range of IP addresses\u2074). Each AS has complex agreements with others about how many packets of data they can transfer, what performance (latency) they can expect and what the price will be per packet. It is typical for each AS to have multiple peering agreements, so that if one link goes down, traffic can still flow; if one link gets overwhelmed, an AS can start using additional links even if the cost to them is higher.

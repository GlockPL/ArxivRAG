Electroencephalography (EEG), as an objective tool for identifying brain disorders, holds great promise. However, extracting meaningful and reliable features from high-dimensional EEG data, especially by integrating spatiotemporal brain dynamics into informative representations, remains a major challenge. In this study, we introduce an advanced semi-supervised adversarial network, NSSI-Net, to effectively model EEG features related to NSSI. NSSI-Net consists of two key modules: a spatial-temporal feature extraction module and a multi-concept discriminator. In the spatial-temporal feature extraction module, an integrated 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) are used to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics in EEG data. In the multi-concept discriminator, signal, gender, domain, and disease levels are fully explored to extract meaningful EEG features, considering individual, demographic, disease variations across a diverse population. Based on self-collected NSSI data (n=114), the model's effectiveness and reliability are demonstrated, with a 7.44% improvement in performance compared to existing machine learning and deep learning methods. This study advances the understanding and early diagnosis of NSSI in adolescents with depression, enabling timely intervention.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "MAJOR depressive disorder (MDD) is a widespread chronic mental illness that manifests across all age groups [1]. Adolescents, in particular, exhibit a notably high prevalence of MDD, with approximately 13% of this population affected [2]. Among those diagnosed with depression, nearly 50% are reported to engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behaviors [3]. NSSI involves intentionally harming oneself, like cutting or burning, without the intent to die. It has drawn attention due to its connection to long-term psychological problems and increased risk of suicide [4], [5]. The rising occurrence of NSSI among adolescents with depression [6], [7] highlights an urgent need for effective tools and methods to understand, diagnose, and intervene in these behaviors. Early detection of NSSI behavior is absolutely vital for effective disease treatment and for preventing further severe harm. An Automated detection approach not only aids in the management of underlying psychological issues but also significantly reduces the risk of the individual engaging in more dangerous or life-threatening actions in the future.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct method for reflecting neuronal dynamics originating in the central nervous system [8], making it highly valuable in detecting abnormal brain activities. EEG has been widely used across various disease fields due to its non-invasive nature, high temporal resolution, and sensitivity to brain dynamics. For example, it plays a crucial role in epilepsy research [9], Alzheimer's Disease (AD) studies [10], depression diagnosis and monitoring [11], autism spectrum disorder (ASD) analysis [12], and schizophrenia research [13]. These applications underscore the versatility and importance of EEG in understanding and managing neurological and psychiatric conditions. In addition, the extraction of spatiotemporal features from EEG signals is crucial in revealing brain activity patterns related to diseases. For example, in seizure detection, EEGWaveNet developed a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatiotemporal features [14], leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Liu et al. proposed a three-dimensional convolutional attention neural network (3DCANN) for EEG emotion recognition, integrating spatio-temporal feature extraction with an EEG channel attention module to effectively capture dynamic inter-channel relationships over time [15]. Zhang et al. introduced two deep learning-based frameworks that utilize spatio-temporal preserving representations of raw EEG streams to accurately identify human intentions. These frameworks combine convolutional and recurrent neural networks, effectively exploring spatial and temporal information either in a cascade or parallel configuration [16]. Gao et al. developed a novel EEG-based spatial-temporal convolutional neural network (ESTCNN) designed to detect driver fatigue by leveraging the spatial-temporal structure of multichannel EEG signals [17]. These studies highlight the effectiveness of spatiotemporal feature extraction in enhancing both the interpretability and performance of EEG-based disease studies.\nHowever, in existing EEG-based disease studies, the inherent individual variability in EEG signals and the heavy reliance on labeling information present considerable challenges. This individual variability, which can arise from differences in brain anatomy, age, gender, and even the state of disease, often leads to inconsistencies in data interpretation and can significantly impact the generalization of intelligent models. The dependence on accurate and extensive labeling requires large, well-annotated datasets that are often time-consuming and costly to obtain. Moreover, labeling is subject to human error and bias, which can introduce noise into the training process, leading to models that may perform well on specific datasets but fail to generalize effectively to new, unseen data. To address the challenges present in existing EEG-based disease studies and to develop a robust, clinically applicable method for NSSI detection across diverse patient populations, we propose a novel multi-concept Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, named NSSI-Net. This framework is developed using a semi-supervised learning approach, allowing it to effectively handle the variability in EEG signals and reduce dependency on extensive labeled data. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 We propose a novel framework, NSSI-Net, which integrates a multi-concept discriminator architecture. This architecture incorporates discriminators at the signal, gender, domain, and disease levels, taking into account variations in individual and demographic characteristics and enabling the efficient extraction of spatiotemporal EEG features across a diverse population.\n\u2022 NSSI-Net is designed to operate within a semi-supervised learning paradigm, reducing the model's reliance on manually labeled data. It not only mitigates the challenges associated with obtaining large, fully labeled datasets but also enhances the model's generalizability across different patient populations.\n\u2022 The proposed NSSI-Net is validated using a self-constructed EEG dataset, consisting of recordings from 114 adolescents diagnosed with depression. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of NSSI-Net in accurately detecting NSSI behaviors, establishing its potential for clinical application in diverse settings."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "NSSI in adolescents with MDD has garnered significant research interest due to its rising prevalence and associated long-term psychological consequences. The neural underpinnings of NSSI in depressed youth are complex, involving both structural and functional alterations in brain regions critical for emotion regulation, impulse control, and self-referential processing. Recent neuroimaging studies, utilizing a range of techniques including EEG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), have shed light on these neural mechanisms. Iznak et al. [18] utilized EEG identified notable differences in brain activity between depressive female adolescents with suicidal and non-suicidal auto-aggressive behaviors, particularly highlighting disruptions in regions involved in emotional regulation and impulse control. Auerbach et al. [19] reviewed MRI studies on NSSI in youth, identifying significant brain alterations. The research found reduced volume in the anterior cingulate cortex and other regions linked to emotion regulation. Functional MRI also showed altered frontolimbic connectivity and blunted striatal activation in adolescents with NSSI. Melinda et al. [20] used diffusion MRI to identify significant white matter microstructural deficits in adolescents and young adults with NSSI compared to healthy controls. These deficits may contribute to an increased vulnerability to maladaptive coping strategies like NSSI, with lower white matter integrity being linked to longer NSSI duration and higher impulsivity. The above studies collectively suggest that NSSI behaviors in depressed adolescents are driven by intricate neural mechanisms are highly related to the abnormalities in neural patterns. An efficient and reliable NSSI detection method using neural signals could reduce the occurrence and recurrence of NSSI, thereby preventing the escalation to more severe outcomes such as suicidal behavior in real life."}, {"title": "B. EEG Studies Exploring NSSI in Depressed Adolescents", "content": "In recent years, researchers have increasingly focused on utilizing EEG to explore the neural underpinnings of NSSI. In 2021, a study highlighted significant differences in EEG frequency and spatial components between depressive female adolescents who had attempted suicide and those who engaged in NSSI, demonstrating the potential of EEG as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between these two groups [21]. Moreover, subsequent research has revealed notable alterations in emotion-related EEG components and brain lateralization in response to negative emotional stimuli among adolescents with NSSI, suggesting that these neural changes could be crucial in understanding the emotional dysregulation associated with NSSI [22]. Further investigations have explored the effects of therapeutic interventions on EEG patterns in NSSI patients. For example, Zhao et al. 's work observed significant changes in EEG microstate patterns before and after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment, indicating that EEG can not only reflect the abnormal neural activity related to NSSI but also monitor the impact of therapeutic interventions [23]. These findings underscore the importance of EEG as a non-invasive, real-time measure that can provide insights into the neural dynamics associated with NSSI, potentially leading to more targeted and effective treatments.\nOn the other hand, machine learning and deep learning approaches have also been investigated for analyzing EEG signals to predict NSSI behaviors. For example, Marti et al. used classification trees model that leverages EEG features to identify young adults at risk for NSSI [24]. Kim et al. developed a Graph Theory-Based Model utilizing resting-state EEG to analyze cortical functional networks and classify patients with MDD into those who have attempted suicide and those with suicidal ideation [25]. Kentopp et al. developed an Adaptive Transfer Learning-based EEG Classification model specifically designed to classify EEG signals of adolescents with and without a history of NSSI [26]. However, these approaches often depend heavily on prior knowledge for model parameter adjustment and require comprehensive label information for fully supervised learning. This reliance poses challenges in clinical settings, where data may be sparse, labels may be incomplete, and manual intervention in model tuning is impractical. These existing methods may fall short of meeting the complex demands of clinical practice. Therefore, there is a need for a more robust and adaptable end-to-end semi-supervised learning model capable of effectively addressing the complexities of clinical data."}, {"title": "C. Deep Learning for Feature Extraction from High-Dimensional EEG Data", "content": "Efficient feature extraction from high-dimensional EEG signals is essential for unraveling the complexities of brain functions and advancing accurate computational modeling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to capture the inherent and dynamic nature of EEG signals [24]. Deep learning methods offer the capability to automatically identify and characterize informative spatio-temporal features within EEG data, which not only enhance the precision of feature extraction but also allow for the dynamic adaptation to the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of brain activity [27]-[29]. For example, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was introduced, which processed EEG data as volumetric sequences and enhanced feature representation capabilities [30]. Considering the temporal dynamics in EEG series, a hierarchical spatial-temporal neural network was proposed to analyze the transition from regional to global brain activity, demonstrating the efficacy of deep learning in capturing detailed spatiotemporal information [31]. Besides of supervised learning, Liang et al. introduced a deep unsupervised autoencoder (AE) model (EEGFuseNet) designed to automatically characterize the interplay between spatial and temporal information in EEG data [32]. The latent features extracted by EEGFuseNet showed great potential for generalization across various applications. These works have underscored the transformative potential of deep learning in EEG research, which provide a more comprehensive, accurate and reliable understanding of brain activities."}, {"title": "D. Semi-Supervised Learning in EEG Modeling", "content": "Current deep learning approaches in EEG analysis are predominantly dependent on fully labeled datasets. However, in clinical environments, acquiring such well-annotated data is both challenging and expensive. Semi-supervised learning frameworks present a promising solution to this problem by enabling the use of both labeled and unlabeled data. Preliminary investigations into semi-supervised learning have shown encouraging results in various EEG studies. For example, a semi-supervised clustering method was proposed to effectively group EEG signals based on their underlying patterns, even with minimal labeled data [33]. Further, Zhang et al. introduced a pairwise alignment of representations in semi-supervised EEG learning (PARSE), which enhances the consistency of feature representations across different data domains by aligning similar features from labeled and unlabeled data [34]. Recently, Ye et al. proposed a semi-supervised dual-stream self-attentive adversarial graph contrastive learning model to effectively leverage limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data for cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition [35]. These methods successfully employed semi-supervised techniques to classify neurological conditions with a reduced amount of labeled data, achieving comparable accuracy to fully supervised models. This indicates the potential of semi-supervised learning in advancing EEG-based diagnostics and interventions, especially in resource-constrained clinical settings."}, {"title": "III. PARTICIPANTS AND DATA", "content": "We recruited a total of 114 adolescent patients, aged 13 to 18 years, from Shenzhen Kangning Hospital, all of whom had at least five years of education.

The study received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Kangning Hospital (Approval No: 2020-K021-04-1). Informed consent was obtained from all participants and their guardians prior to enrollment.\nIn this study, NSSI behavior was defined based on the following criteria: (1) intentional self-inflicted injury to body tissue without suicidal intent within the past year; (2) the behavior served at least one of the following purposes: alleviating or relieving negative emotions, resolving interpersonal problems, or achieving a desired emotional state; (3) the self-injurious behavior was linked to at least one of the following: it occurred after interpersonal rejection or in response to negative emotions, there was an inability to resist the urge to self-harm, or thoughts of self-harm were present; (4) the behavior involved socially unacceptable actions, such as repeated cutting or picking at wounds. According to the NSSI criteria, the recruited patients were divided into two groups: Depression with NSSI (DN+), consisting of 77 subjects (65 females), and Depression without NSSI (DN-), consisting of 37 subjects (18 females)."}, {"title": "B. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing", "content": "Each participant completed a total of 35 trials, with each trial involving the viewing of a natural image related to social pain.

The data were captured at a sampling rate of 500 Hz.\nA standard EEG preprocessing pipeline was applied to the raw EEG signals to remove artificial artifacts, including eye movements, muscle activity, and environmental noise. Following artifact correction, the sampling rate was downsampled from 500 Hz to 384 Hz, reducing data dimensionality and making the data more efficient for subsequent processing and analysis.

Input Data", "content": "Based on the collected data, we categorize it into two domains: the source domain S and the target domain T. Within the semi-supervised learning framework, the source domain (S) is further subdivided into a smaller labeled subset (denoted as $S_t$) and a larger unlabeled subset (denoted as $S_u$). Here, a division ratio, denoted as $\\tau$% determines that $\\tau$% of the source data forms the labeled subset ($S_t$), while the remaining $(1-\\tau)$% constitutes the unlabeled subset ($S_u$).\nConsidering the data imbalance (NSSI: 77 patients, including 65 females and 12 males; non-NSSI: 37 patients, including 18 females and 19 males) and the gender distribution, a data sampling strategy is implemented across $S_t$, $S_u$, and T. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the sampling process for both the NSSI and non-NSSI groups is explained. For the NSSI group (denoted as DN+), 18 females are randomly selected from the 65 available candidates (represented by the red hatched figures), and all 12 males are included, ensuring equal gender representation within DN+. For the non-NSSI group (denoted as DN-), all 18 females (solid blue figures) are included, along with 12 randomly selected males from the 19 available candidates, achieving a balanced gender distribution comparable to the NSSI group. This sampling process results in a dataset of 30 NSSI patients (DN+) and 30 non-NSSI patients (DN-), balanced across both condition and gender."}, {"title": "B. Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction", "content": "To effectively extract spatial and temporal features from input EEG signals, we designed a hybrid neural network that combines CNNs with GRUs. This architecture captures interactions both among different brain regions and across various time points, enhancing the representation of complex EEG dynamics.\nInspired by the EEGNet structure [36], we develop a deep encoder-decoder network based on CNNs. The CNN-based encoder for spatial information extraction is shown in Fig. 2, represented by the green horizontal arrow. The input EEG sample is denoted as $X \\in R^{C \\times P}$, where C is the number of EEG channels and P represents the number of sampling points per second. The CNN-based feature extractor adopts 2D convolution to map the input EEG samples into a more expressive feature space, providing a compact yet comprehensive representation of the spatial dynamics of the EEG signals. The obtained feature map is represented as $X = (x_1,...,x_M) \\in R^{M\\times 1\\times F}$, where M is the number of feature maps and F is the feature dimensionality.\nTo further uncover the relationships of the brain patterns over time and encapsulate the key temporal dynamics of the entire EEG signal sequence, a BiGRU based encoder-decoder structure is designed. The BiGRU-based encoder for temporal information extraction is illustrated in Fig. 2, represented by the green vertical arrow. In our implementation, we used a BiGRU to process the sequence of feature vectors generated by the CNN encoder. The forward and backward passes of the BiGRU produce corresponding hidden states, which are concatenated to form the deep feature representation vector $A = (a_1,...,a_M) \\in R^{M\\times 1\\times 2F}$. Once A is obtained from the concatenated hidden states of the BiGRU, it is fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to derive $Y = (y_1, ..., y_M) \\in R^{M\\times 1\\times F}$. This MLP transforms the feature representation into a more refined feature space, capturing non-linear relationships between the elements of A. Following this, a flatten operation is applied to Y, resulting in the output vector $O \\in R^{1\\times MF}$.

Analysis of Confusion Matrices", "content": "To further evaluate model performance across different subgroups and identify any biases or inconsistencies in the prediction outcomes, we analyze the confusion matrices for three demographic groups: the entire dataset, the female subgroup, and the male subgroup. As shown in Fig. 3, we consider DN+ as the positive class and DN- as the negative class.\nThe overall confusion matrix reflects the model's performance across the entire dataset. The true negative (TN) rate is 78.60%, and the true positive (TP) rate is 60.70%, indicating that the model is reasonably effective at distinguishing between DN+ and DN- cases. However, the false positive (FP) rate of 21.40% and false negative (FN) rate of 39.30% reveal limitations, particularly in identifying DN+ cases. The higher FN rate suggests difficulty in correctly identifying DN+ instances, potentially due to the inherent variability in EEG signals among individuals.\nFor the female subgroup, the confusion matrix shows a TN rate of 82.86% and a TP rate of 59.35%, indicating slightly better performance in correctly identifying DN- cases compared to DN+ cases. The FP rate is lower at 17.14%, while the FN rate is 40.65%. These results imply that the model is more accurate in predicting DN- in females, potentially due to the higher prevalence of NSSI in females, making the EEG patterns associated with DN- more distinguishable. However, the relatively high FN rate indicates considerable room for improvement in detecting DN+ cases in this subgroup.\nFor the male subgroup, the confusion matrix reveals a different pattern, with a lower TN rate of 71.92% but a higher TP rate of 62.85%. The FP rate is notably higher at 28.08%, while the FN rate is lower at 37.15%. This distribution suggests that the model is more sensitive to detecting DN+ cases in males but at the cost of a higher rate of false positives, indicating a potential gender-specific bias. This bias might be influenced by the generally lower prevalence of NSSI among males, making it more challenging for the model to distinguish between DN- and DN+ cases in this subgroup.\nIn summary, the confusion matrices reveal that while the model performs reasonably well overall, there are notable differences in performance across gender-specific subgroups. The model tends to be more accurate in identifying DN- cases in females and DN+ cases in males, which may be attributed to underlying biological and psychological differences between genders. However, the higher FP rate in males and the higher FN rate in females highlight areas for further improvement, particularly in addressing potential gender biases in the model's predictions. Future improvements could focus on refining the gender-specific discriminator or incorporating a larger, more balanced dataset to enhance the model's robustness and accuracy."}, {"title": "VI.

Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Collaboration is a fundamental aspect of the nature and human society. Whether among humans or animals, working together allows groups to overcome individual limitations and achieve greater collective outcomes. In nature, collaboration often arises as a strategy to boost survival, enhance resource gathering, or increase efficiency in completing tasks. Similarly, in human societies, collaboration drives innovation, facilitates problem-solving, and fosters shared understanding, enabling individuals to address complex challenges that would be unmanageable otherwise. This innate tendency to collaborate is evident across various domains, from social communities to technological systems, where multiple entities coordinate their efforts toward a common goal. As we advance in developing intelligent agents, understanding and replicating these collaborative dynamics in artificial systems has become increasingly important, predominantly to cope with the complexity and adaptability seen in real-world interactions.\nAgents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, single-agent systems encounter significant difficulties when tasked with problems that are either too large or complex, often resulting in instability, misalignment with the intended request, and hallucination. To address these limitations, research has increasingly turned toward Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS have shown greater efficacy in harnessing collective intelligence by allowing individual agents to specialize in distinct skills and facilitating effective collaboration among them."}, {"title": "RELATED WORKS", "content": "Multi Agent Frameworks Recent advancements in MAS have led to the development of numerous platforms that facilitate collaboration among multiple agents. AutoGen introduces a framework for building LLM-based applications where agents communicate with each other to accomplish tasks. CAMEL  is designed to enable autonomous collaboration among chat-based language models using role-playing and inception prompting. ChatDev  offers a chat-driven framework where LLM-powered agents work together to streamline software design, coding, and testing through unified language communication. MetaGPT  provides a meta-programming approach that encodes Standardized Operating Procedures into prompt sequences, facilitating efficient and error-reducing collaboration among LLM-based agents. AgentVerse orchestrates collaborative groups of expert agents, drawing inspiration from human group dynamics to enhance task performance beyond the capabilities of individual agents. These MAS platforms address various aspects of the collaborative process, including agent profiling, recruitment, memory, planning, and communication protocols. However, they do not specifically investigate the group decision-making mechanisms within multi-agent interactions as we do in this paper. Some platforms employ centralized methods, and others only rely on unanimous or majority voting.\nMulti-Agent Collaboration Environments Multi-agent collaboration has been used to handle various applications. In robotics, there has been a continuous study regarding multi-agent collaboration in embodied environments. In these studies, multi-agent collaboration in robotics has been explored through various frameworks, such as task allocation, coordination strategies, and communication protocols, to optimize collective performance and adaptability in dynamic environments. For LLM-based MAS, software development is a popular environment which inherently requires diverse expertise, continuous integration, and coordinated teamwork to build complex, functional systems efficiently . Additionally, LLM's strong context understanding and immense parametric knowledge supported various world simulations with multi-agents. Including simulating society , economy , gaming, and psychology . These works require agents to interact with others in a group, and investigate their cooperate and competitive behavior."}, {"title": "MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION AND GROUP DECISION-MAKING", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the formal definition of the setting this study uses for MAS, and propose RoundTable, a turn-based multi-agent collaboration platform for evaluating different decentralized group decision-making.\nIn a collaboration environment, there is a set of individuals (agents) $i \\in I$, and a set of all possible states of the world $X = \\{X_1,X_2,X_3,...\\}$. Then there is an individual utility function $U_i: X \\rightarrow R$ for each agent that maps a state to a real number, representing preferences of agents. Based on the individual utility function, each agent proposes a state with proposal function $P_i = f_p(u_i, C_i, X), p_i \\in X$, where $C_i$ is the context, including environment information, background, and collaboration history. Similarly, agent can also vote on proposals with voting function $V_{ij} = f_v(U_i, C_i, S|p_i \\in S \\subseteq X), i, j \\in I$, where $S$ represents a candidate list of proposals to vote on. With all proposals and agents' votes, a social choice method (function) $F$ decides one group decision $x^* = F(P_i, V_{ij}|i, j \\in I)$. For example, when $F = Majority, P_1 = Apple, p_2 = Banana, p_3 = Carrot, U_{1,j}, U_{2,j} = (Yes, No, No), V_{3,j} = (No,Yes, No)$, then $x^* = p_1 = Apple$."}, {"title": "ROUNDTABLE: MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION PLATFORM", "content": "With the definition above, we propose RoundTable, a multi-agent collaboration platform that can take various group decision-making mechanisms. The overview of RoundTable is shown in Figure 1. Due to the limited space, the details of the platform design and the LLM prompt are shown in Appendix A.1 and A.2. Following is a brief introduction of each phase.\n\u2022 Input and Initialization: RoundTable takes initial query (task), and initializes each agent giving agent specific background and utility function (or goals).\n\u2022 Collaboration Round: RoundTable employs round-based agent collaboration, with each round comprising three phases. Each phase occurs in a simultaneous open conversation, where agents act without order, and information is shared with everyone at the end of each phase. The process ends after $R$ rounds.\nMessage Phase: Each agent sends a message to its intended recipients.\nProposal Phase: Each agent proposes a potential solution, with an option to skip.\nVoting Phase: Each agent votes for the candidate list, with an option to skip. The list consists with each agent's latest proposal and latest accepted proposal by the group. With all votes, social choice method chooses the winner. If ties or disqualifies, the decision is deferred.\n\u2022 Output: After the final round, the latest accepted proposal will be selected as the final output of this system."}, {"title": "SOCIAL CHOICE METHODS", "content": "To investigate the impact of different social choice methods on group decision-making in multi-agent collaboration, we compare the following 6 mechanisms:\n\u2022 Unanimous Voting: The proposal that receives votes from all agents will be selected.\n\u2022 Majority Voting: The proposal that receives votes from more than half of all agents will be selected.\n\u2022 Plurality Voting: The proposal that receives the most votes will be selected.\n\u2022 Rated Voting: Each agent assigns ratings on a 5-point Likert scale to all candidate proposals, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. The proposal with the highest total score will be selected.\n\u2022 Ranked Voting: Each agent ranks all candidate proposals from the most preferred to the least preferred. Social Choice will assign 1, 1/2, 1/3... points to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd... candidates on each ballot. The proposal with the highest total points will be selected.\nCumulative Voting: For $|I|$ candidate proposals, each agent is given $|I|$ points to distribute among the proposals as they see fit. The proposal with the highest total points will be selected.\nUnanimous, majority and plurality voting are one-vote mechanisms, where agents only choose the best candidate from the list; rated, ranked and cumulative voting are score-based mechanisms, which ask a nuanced, gradient preference over candidates."}, {"title": "EXPERIMENTS", "content": "Using RoundTable, we explore multi-agent behavior patterns in $R = 10$ rounds of collaboration.

First, it is a plus-sum game"}, {"title": "COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT - RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM", "content": "Introduction For the complex environment, we focus on a recommendation system. It reveals unique collaborative behaviors absent in exchange economies. First, strong information asymmetry exists, as no single piece of information can accurately predict ratings. Second, group decision-making fosters diverse problem-solving approaches, with agents both consuming and contributing information in a feedback loop that enhances recommendations.\nThe task is to predict user ratings for specific items by analyzing historical interactions and identifying data patterns. This task is challenging for a single-agent system due to the overwhelming amount of scattered and limited essential information. In our setting, we divide the background information into several parts and assign each to different agents. The agents must then collaborate by exploring, analyzing, exchanging, and synthesizing their information to reach a comprehensive conclusion."}, {"title": "CROSS-AGENT CONVERSATION ANALYSIS", "content": "To understand agent collaboration and analyze their messages, we perform a language analysis focused on four key features. All observations are collected in 3 agents, gpt-4o-mini setting.\n\u2022 Message Length is a basic yet significant metric, reflecting the amount of information an agent conveys. We measure it using word count, as longer messages generally enrich the conversation.\n\u2022 Message Complexity assesses how difficult a message is to understand, indicating the depth of the conversation. We use the Flesch-Kincaid grade level to calculate complexity, with higher scores representing more intricate messages .\n\u2022 Information Difference measures how much new information is introduced. Effective collaboration should consistently bring new insights, while low information gain signals a stalled conversation. It is calculated as the average cosine distance between messages in the current round and the center embedding of the previous round.\n\u2022 Dialogue Acts are communicative functions that capture actions, intents, and behaviors within messages as discrete states. We design a set of dialogue acts for multi-agent collaboration: Inform, Request, Confirm, Summarize, Evaluate, Propose, Compromise, Defend, Accept, Decline, and use LLM-labeling to perform multi-label classification on a target message based on the previous round. Details of the dialogue act labels and prompt can be found in Appendix C.5."}, {"title": "DIALOGUE ACT TRANSITION GRAPH", "content": "We constructed transition graphs to visualize the dynamics of dialogue act transitions across rounds, highlighting the most frequent transitions. Each node represents a dialogue act, and directed edges indicate the probability of transitions between acts from one round to the next. The figure displays only the most probable edge per node, excluding self-loops. The detailed definition of nodes and edges is in Appendix C.6."}, {"title": "EARLY STOPPING IN MAS", "content": "In the previous experiments, we enforced 10 rounds of collaboration to compare agent behaviors and identify patterns. However, effective early stopping can prevent redundancy, avoid stagnation, and optimize decision-making by reducing unnecessary iterations. In this experiment, we evaluate the following early stopping methods:\n\u2022 @10 is our baseline, the final performance after 10 rounds without early stopping.\n\u2022 First Agreement stops collaboration whenever a proposal passes the social choice criterion.\n\u2022 Consecutive Agreements is when no one make additional proposal after a proposal has been accepted in the previous round.\n\u2022 Validation Checkpoint is the average number of rounds that produced the best outcomes in the train set, used as an early stopping criterion for all test sets.\n\u2022 Information Difference is the average embedding distance captured at the round that produced the best outcomes in the train set, and stops collaborations in the test set when the distance became lower than the threshold. This idea is supported by the observation in Section 5.3.1.\n\u2022 Dialogue Act method utilizes pairs of dialogue acts, linking one from the previous round to another from the current round. We perform ordinary least squares (OLS) regression on all such pairs in relation to the performance. The regression coefficients indicate the most impactful pairs that act as stop signals. Further details of the algorithm are provided in Appendix C.7.\nWe use 5-fold cross validation to compare the methods with Oracle: the oracle performance for early stopping, which reflects the best outcomes from each test simulation."}, {"title": "RESULTS", "content": ""}, {"title": "EXCHANGE ECONOMY", "content": "The experiment results show distinct performance differences across social choice methods in Table 1 and Figure 2(a). Score-based mechanisms achieve higher performance early in the collaboration process compared to one-vote mechanisms, indicating that nuanced evaluations better aggregate agent preferences. One-vote mechanisms struggle with lower and less stable early performance due to increased disagreement, which impairs decision-making. Despite differing early trajectories, all social choice methods reach high-quality outcomes by the end. In most cases, performance peaks in the middle rounds, suggesting that early stopping could be advantageous. Rationality scores show that agents often make suboptimal choices, but decentralized MAS still performs well overall. Score-based mechanisms allow more dynamic decision updates, while one-vote mechanisms exhibit greater rigidity, particularly with unanimous voting.\nWhen comparing one-vote mechanisms, unanimous voting performs the worst due to its inflexibility and need for total agreement, while majority voting slightly outperforms plurality. Additionally, fairness gradually decreases from unanimous to plurality voting. These observations suggest that, compared to the rigid unanimous method or the looser rules of plurality voting, a moderate level of decision flexibility leads to better outcomes, albeit with some sacrifice in fairness across agents.\nFor the results of ablation studies, please refer to Appendix D.1."}, {"title": "RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM", "content": "We illustrate the performance of recommendation system in Figure 3(a), 3(b) and Table 7. The results shows that multi-agent collaboration achieves moderate performance with distributed information, with the decentralized MAS performing comparably to SoTA approaches. While the SOTA method was purely machine-learning-driven, the MAS approach showed reasonable outcomes, indicating that collaboration between agents can explore and produce meaningful signals that help to make decision. Multi-agent collaboration with access to SoTA models may lead to better performance, but we leave this experiment for future work. Similar to the exchange economy, multiple results in the recommendation system follow a V-shaped curve. This suggests that while agent collaboration was efficient early on, it declined in later rounds, highlighting diminishing returns from repeated interactions. The trend underscores the need to balance sustained collaboration within MAS over time.\nWhen comparing one-vote mechanisms to score-based mechanisms, we found that one-vote approaches generally worsened or plateaued after several rounds of collaboration. In contrast, score-based mechanisms showed consistent improvement over time, suggesting that score-based mechanisms are better suited for scenarios requiring continuous improvement, allowing for more nuanced input and refinement over multiple rounds."}, {"title": "CROSS-AGENT CONVERSATION ANALYSIS", "content": ""}, {"title": "BASIC STATISTICS", "content": "Table 8 shows the average values of message length, complexity, and information difference per round. Message length increases over time in both environments, with shorter messages in early rounds and longer ones later. The recommendation system generally has longer messages due to its need for detailed explanations. Message complexity in the exchange economy starts low, peaks early, dips, and then gradually increases toward the final round, while the recommendation system shows consistently higher and increasing complexity throughout. Information difference steadily decreases in both environments, indicating a convergence of topics and less novel information as the discussions progress.\nThe dialogue act annotation results are presented in Table 9 in Appendix D.4. The dialogue act annotation results in both environments show that Inform and Request acts dominate, indicating frequent information sharing and input requests critical for task progression. The Confirm act rises sharply after round 3 in the recommendation system and more gradually in the exchange economy, showing validation is more prominent in recommendation tasks. Summarize acts increase slightly in later rounds, consolidating information, while Evaluate acts remain consistently high, reflecting ongoing assessment. Propose acts surge early in the exchange economy and peak later in the recommendation system, suggesting early proposals are vital in negotiations.

To begin, V-shaped performance trends were observed across most cases, where the best outcome is observed before reaching the final checkpoint (@10), indicating that intermediate stopping leads to better results than allowing the process to fully complete. This pattern supports the necessity of early stopping in multi-agent collaboration settings, where overextending the interaction can lead to diminishing returns in performance.\nAlmost all early stopping methods outperformed the baseline (@10), reinforcing the effectiveness of early termination in improving outcomes. Notably, methods leveraging linguistic features, such as Information Difference and Dialogue Act, delivered better performance across different social choices and environments. These findings highlight the advantage of incorporating dialogue-based metrics in deciding when to stop, especially in complex multi-agent environments. Their results across both the exchange economy and recommendation system scenarios further supports the claim that linguistic indicators can be powerful tools for optimizing collaboration outcomes, reducing cognitive load, and improving decision efficiency."}, {"title": "DISCUSSION", "content": ""}, {"title": "IMPACT OF SOCIAL CHOICE METHODS ON COLLABORATIVE BEHAVIOR", "content": "The study demonstrates that social choice methods significantly impact multi-agent collaboration, with score-based mechanisms achieving higher performance and efficiency, especially in early rounds, by allowing agents to express nuanced preferences. In contrast, one-vote mechanisms struggle with rigidity, leading to lower initial performance. The strictness of social choice methods, such as unanimous voting, reduces collaboration performance due to its inability to accommodate dissent. Score-based mechanisms, which support expressing preference gradients, foster dynamic exchanges and improved decision quality, making them more effective in negotiation-heavy tasks.\nOne-vote mechanisms also have unique advantages. First, the format of voting is simpler than score-based mechanisms, which led to fewer format errors during experiments from LLMs. Furthermore, unanimous voting showed the highest fairness and non-decreasing outcome over rounds when utility is quantifiable. These strengths suggest that social choice methods in decentralized MAS should be thoughtfully chosen based on the specific task, or the primary metric being prioritized. Mixture of different methods in different stages of collaboration may also bring effectiveness, which we leave for future studies."}, {"title": "LINGUISTIC INDICATORS OF COLLABORATION", "content": "Linguistic analysis of agent conversations reveals several key indicators of effective collaboration. The length and complexity of messages increase progressively across rounds, suggesting that deeper engagement and richer exchanges occur as the collaboration advanced. This is particularly evident in the recommendation system environment, where tasks require greater information exchange and negotiation. Complex tasks inherently demand more intricate language, as agents need to convey not just factual information but also interpret, analyze, and synthesize inputs from others.\nDialogue acts provide another layer of insight into collaborative behavior. Inform, Propose and Request acts dominate conversations, highlighting that agents were frequently sharing new information and seeking clarifications, which are essential for progressing towards a solution. Confirm act became more prevalent in later stages, particularly in environments where validation was crucial. Interestingly, Propose and Evaluate acts were more frequent in negotiation-oriented tasks, like exchange economies, where agents needed to offer and assess potential solutions regularly. This linguistic pattern underscores that successful collaboration hinges on the flow of information, clarification, and ongoing evaluation of proposals. These indicators align with patterns seen in human collaboration, where information exchange and continuous feedback loops drive cooperative success."}, {"title": "EARLY STOPPING IN MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION", "content": "Early stopping is essential in multi-agent collaboration because it prevents diminishing returns and inefficiency in decision-making. Our experiments shows that while the initial rounds of collaboration led to significant improvements in group utility and decision quality, continuing beyond a certain point often results in stagnant or even declining performance. This highlights the need for mechanisms that can intelligently terminate the collaboration process once optimal solutions have been reached, avoiding unnecessary iterations.\nKey insights into effective early stopping methods emerge from analyzing conversational patterns. Information difference suggests that as the rounds progress, the novelty of information decreases, with fewer new ideas being introduced. Transition graphs of dialogue acts reveal common collaborative patterns. These signals lead to linguistic feature-based stopping methods, which halt collaboration when no meaningful new information is detected, or when dialogue act patterns indicate the need for termination. Our findings demonstrate that implementing early stopping methods based on linguistic cues can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of decentralized multi-agent collaboration by preventing unnecessary prolonged discussions."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper investigates the dynamics of cross-agent communication and decentralized decision-making in MAS, exploring how agent conversation and social choice methods impact collaboration and collective intelligence. We show that only the correct selection of a social choice method for a given environment can promote the success of a MAS, linguistic features of agent conversations serve as indicators of effective collaboration, and these cues provide valuable information for the effective termination of MAS.\nLLM generation and prediction are unstable, with single agents often making quasi-random actions based on observations. Decentralized MAS improve performance by guiding agents through conversations to make more targeted proposals and enabling group decision-making to select the best option. Our study provides insights into how group communication and decentralized decision-making enhance multi-agent collaboration, offering important implications for designing more efficient MAS environments."}, {"title": "DETAILS OF ROUNDTABLE", "content": ""}, {"title": "ROUNDTABLE PLATFORM DESIGN", "content": "In this section, we explain the details of the design in RoundTable by breaking it down to phases.\nInput and Initialization defines each agent for collaboration.

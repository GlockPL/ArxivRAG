Effective management and early detection of BPSD are crucial to reduce the stress and burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. Despite the advancements in machine learning for dementia prediction, there is a considerable gap in utilizing these methods for BPSD prediction. This study aims to fill this gap by presenting a novel personalized framework for BPSD prediction, utilizing physiological signals from smart wearable devices. Our personalized fine-grained BPSD prediction method accurately predicts BPSD occurrences by extracting individual behavioral patterns, while the generalized models identify diverse patterns and differentiate between various BPSD symptoms. Detailed comparisons between the proposed personalized method and conventional generalized methods reveals substantial improvements across all performance metrics, including a 16.0% increase in AUC. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method in advancing dementia care by enabling proactive interventions and improving patient outcomes in real-world scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that leverages physiological signals from smart wearable devices to predict BPSD, marking a significant stride in dementia care research.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "BEHAVIORAL and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) represent a diverse range of non-cognitive symptoms commonly manifest in individuals with dementia. These symptoms include disinhibition, anxiety, elation/euphoria, agitation/aggression, hallucinations, delusions, apathy/indifference, irritability, appetite and eating abnormalities, aberrant motor behavior, depression/dysphoria, and sleep and night-time behavior disturbances occurring at any stage of the disease that constitutes a vital clinical aspect of dementia [1][2]. The management of BPSD poses significant challenges for clinical applications and caregivers, as it not only impacts the well-being and quality of patients' lives but also leads to elder abuse, caregiver stress, and accelerated functional decline in individuals with dementia [3][4][5][6]. Additionally, the presence of BPSD is associated with several adverse outcomes, including increased hospitalization risks, impaired daily functioning, diminished quality of life, and a higher likelihood of progressing to severe dementia at a faster rate [7][8][9]. Consequently, the early detection and effective management of BPSD assume critical importance in providing timely interventions, support, and care that can positively influence patient outcomes and alleviate the burden on caregivers and healthcare resources. Nevertheless, there is a limited number of studies related to BPSD prediction based on machine learning methods. Cho et al. [12] presented a machine learning-based approach for the next-day BPSD prediction. However, with such a large time frame for predicting whether BPSD will occur the next day, it is not effectively aiding caregivers in early intervention for real-world applications.\nTo address the aforementioned problems, this study proposed a BPSD prediction framework involving personalized and generalized models based on temporal data from smart wearable devices. Personalized models utilize the patient's unique information to extract individual behavioral patterns from wearable devices for predicting the occurrence of BPSD. On the contrary, generalized modeling methods were designed to capture patterns and trends across a diverse population, aiming to develop a predictive framework that applies broadly to different individuals."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "In recent years, the application of advanced machine learning and data analytics techniques in the medical domain has gained significant attention [10]. Dementia research, as a critical area within the medical field, has seen a surge in studies employing machine learning methods [11]. These studies aim to predict the onset of dementia using a diverse range of input data types, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [12][13], positron emission tomography (PET) scans [14], cognitive test data [15], genetic information [16], and medical records [17]. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, neuroimaging data from MRI and PET scans have proven effective in AD classification. Cognitive test results, such as cognitive function scales, have also been widely utilized to forecast dementia onset. Moreover, genetic data has been explored extensively to understand its associations with dementia. However, when addressing the prediction of BPSD, the need arises for easily accessible data that can substantially support clinical caregiving.\nThere are limited studies regarding BPSD prediction with machine learning approaches. Cho et al. [12] presented the first study using demographic, cognitive, and functional status, actigraphy, personality type, and symptom diary data for BPSD prediction. It is also the only study to consider adopting an accelerometer for BPSD prediction research. However, their study focused on the next-day prediction, a wide range of predictive time windows, making it hard to target the particular period for early intervention. It also needed several types of data that require more cost for each patient. Therefore, although their study proposed BPSD prediction models, a gap still existed for real-world applications."}, {"title": "III. PROPOSED METHODS", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Data Description", "content": "The initial study cohort comprised 250 cases. Subsequently, cases with records spanning less than two weeks were excluded. This selection process yielded a dataset of 183 confirmed dementia patients, consisting of 101 females and 82 males. The average age is 77.9 \u00b1 10.2 (female: 77.7 \u00b1 8.8; male: 78.2 \u00b1 11.7), the average education level (year) is 6.6 \u00b1 4.5years (female: 5.0 \u00b1 4.2; male: 8.6 \u00b1 4.1). In addition, caregivers observe the daily behaviors of the patients and record the abnormal behaviors or symptoms related to dementia that occur in their daily lives. These records are used as labels for subsequent prediction. The symptom records are first aligned with the values measured by the wearable device in time, and the physiological values measured every 15 minutes were used to predict the type of BPSD symptoms that will occur in the next four hours. Each participant had physiological signal"}, {"title": "B. Fine-grained BPSD Prediction", "content": "Our proposed framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. The data used in this study consists of physiological signals measured when dementia patients wear smart wearable devices, as well as patients' basic information, i.e., age, sex, and education level. The first step is data preprocessing, containing feature extraction, feature selection, normalization, and imbalance processing. The modeling process consists of personalized and generalized modeling phases. The personalized focused on individual differences, where each patient's data was used to build a unique model, and it was employed to predict the occurrence of BPSD. In contrast, the generalized model was employed to predict the specific type of BPSD. We adopted a two-stage architecture because not all patients exhibit the same type of BPSD, making it impractical to build an individual multiclass BPSD model for each patient. Moreover, the personalized model can accurately capture patients' unique representations, and the generalized model was dedicated to differentiating between different fine-grained BPSD types, leveraging the collective data from all patients. For the personalized model, we employ a separate model for each patient, where we adopted Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT) [19] to construct each personalized model. ERT evolved from Decision Tree [20] and Random Forest [21] algorithms. The main idea behind tree-based methods is to build a hierarchical structure of decision rules based on input features. A decision tree (DT) consists of nodes and branches, where each internal node represents a feature and a decision rule, and each leaf node represents a prediction or class label. Random forest (RF) combines multiple decision trees for prediction. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data, and the final prediction is obtained by aggregating the prediction results of all trees, which can handle high-dimensional data and reduce overfitting. ERT is similar to random forests. However, they make more random selections for feature splitting points when constructing each decision tree, thereby increasing model diversity and generalization capability.\nThe main objective of the personalized models is to predict whether symptoms will occur in the next four hours, which can be represented as follows:\n$L=M (F)$                                                                        (1)\nwhere F is the patient information and features measured by the wearable devices in the past hour. The M represents the model used for predicting the symptoms. L is the label that the patient will experience BPSD, or nothing happened in the next four hours.\nThe generalized model consists of three components as depicted in Fig. 3. First, we aggregated all the patients'"}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Experimental Settings", "content": "The training data from each patient with BPSD records were aggregated to form a generalized dataset. This dataset, comprising data from all patients, was used to train a generalized model. We employed 5-fold cross- validation and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize the performance of this generalized model, which was based on Extra Randomized Trees (ERT). Personalized data for each patient was split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%). It is important to note that personalized models were only constructed for patients with records of BPSD occurrences during the measurement period. Patients without such records were excluded from the personalized model building process.\nDuring the testing phase, the split personalized test data was initially processed by the personalized model to detect the occurrence of BPSD. If the personalized model predicted BPSD occurrence, the data was subsequently passed through the generalized model to classify the specific type of BPSD. The entire assessment process was executed independently for each patient. As a result, the framework's performance was evaluated for each patient separately. To provide an overall assessment of the framework's effectiveness in predicting BPSD occurrences and types, we calculated the average performance across all patients. Performance evaluation of the models includes the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and Fl-score."}, {"title": "B.

Analysis of Personalized Framework with Various Backbone Models", "content": "presents the results of our experiments, showcasing the performance of machine learning approaches Random Forest and a baseline logistic regression model employed in a prior BPSD prediction study [12] with our preprocessing approaches. These results are aggregated across all personalized models, representing the average performance. The experimental results reveal that the conventional approaches cannot achieve good performance without our proposed framework. To explore the expandability and flexibility of our proposed framework, we alternated different backbone models (classifiers) to validate the performance.\ndisplays the results of our proposed framework with various backbones, including RF and LR. Our framework can obviously benefit the performance of different backbone models on every metric. For example, the sensitivity of the baseline model LR has increased from 61.5% to 69.0%, relatively growing 12.2%, while the specificity keeps the same performance; for the RF model, the AUC has relatively increased 5.5%.\nNotably, predicting BPSD within a short and specific timeframe (e.g., the next four hours) presents a challenge for conventional frameworks. Furthermore, the evaluation criteria of the personalized framework are more rigorous than traditional generalized frameworks. While the traditional approach primarily focuses on fine-tuning a single model, the personalized framework needs particular attention to numerous individual models. Consequently, our proposed framework is expertly tailored for fine-grained personalized BPSD prediction, making it a practical solution for real-world use."}, {"title": "D. Ablation Study", "content": "illustrates ablation studies assessing the effectiveness of different components of the proposed framework. The foundational model, the Raw-Data-based Generalized model (RDG), utilized the ERT algorithm for training. Various combinations of these components are investigated to distinguish the contributions of the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and the Individual Representation-based Generalized (IRG) models. The RDG + TCN model exhibits a detectable performance degradation compared to the fundamental RDG model, yielding it less optimal. In contrast, the RDG + IRG model significantly enhances several metrics, underlining the value of incorporating individual representations in the generalized model. Remarkably, the amalgamation of RDG + IRG + TCN outperforms the other models and combinations, achieving superior results in metrics, including AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score, highlighting the effect of integrating temporal contextual information and individualized representations with raw data-based modeling. The final combination generated a robust model that balances various classification metrics, thus providing a promising avenue for advancing state-of-the-art methodologies in the BPSD prediction research."}, {"title": "V.

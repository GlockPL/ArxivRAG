This transition presents unique challenges in mineral resource development, particularly due to geological uncertainty a key characteristic that traditional supply chain optimization approaches do not adequately address. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel application of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) that optimizes critical mineral sourcing decisions while explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of geological uncertainty. Through a case study of the U.S. lithium supply chain, we demonstrate that POMDP-based policies achieve superior outcomes compared to traditional approaches, especially when initial reserve estimates are imperfect. Our framework provides quantitative insights for balancing domestic resource development with international supply diversification, offering policymakers a systematic approach to strategic decision-making in critical mineral supply chains.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The world is embarking on an unprecedented period of critical mineral demand, marking a unique chapter in human history that has no historical parallel [1, 2]. Unlike previous industrial transformations, which relied primarily on widely available resources like iron and coal, the rapid shift toward renewable energy technologies and electric vehicles has created extraordinary challenges in securing reliable supplies of critical minerals, particularly lithium [3, 4, 5]. Recent studies highlight that the projected demand for lithium by 2040 could exceed all historical lithium production combined [6, 7], creating supply challenges that cannot be addressed with traditional industrial scaling approaches.\nThese unprecedented demands are accompanied by significant uncertainties that distinguish critical mineral supply chains from traditional supply chain studies (e.g., [8, 9]), which stem from three primary sources: geological uncertainty in resource estimation, economic and social uncertainty in market dynamics, and geopolitical uncertainty in international relations [10, 11].\nThe economic and environmental implications of rapidly scaling lithium production add another layer of complexity, with studies showing significant risks in investment as well as extensive ecological footprints from water-intensive extraction processes [12]. The challenge of obtaining social licenses for mining projects adds more complexity to the development timeline [13]. Furthermore, the geographic concentration of lithium resources (with the majority of known reserves to date located in a limited number of countries, including Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, China, USA, and Australia), further compounds these challenges [11, 14, 15]. This concentration raises concerns about overreliance on specific countries, which may be susceptible to political and economic instabilities [16, 17, 18].\nThe U.S. lithium supply chain exemplifies these challenges. As illustrated in Figure 1, the current supply chain relies heavily on importing lithium-bearing minerals from geographically distant locations such as Australia, which involves complex maritime routes spanning more than 17,062 nautical miles and requiring approximately 10 weeks of transportation time [19]. The route includes sea transportation from Australian mining sites to U.S. West Coast ports, followed by rail transportation to processing facilities in Nevada, where several battery manufacturers are located. This extended supply chain exposes vulnerabilities to various disruptions and contributes to both economic and environmental costs. While substantial domestic lithium reserves exist (such as the Thacker Pass deposit in Nevada with approximately 1.56 MMt of lithium supply), the exact volume and quality of these reserves remain uncertain [20]. This uncertainty, combined with environmental and social concerns about land use, water consumption, and carbon emissions, has created significant challenges for the development of domestic resources. The mining industry cannot ignore these considerations, as they could result in substantial social and economic penalties.\nWhile these economic, social, and geopolitical uncertainties pose nontrivial challenges to critical mineral supply chains, the inability to accurately assess subsurface mineral deposits without extensive exploration represents a distinctive characteristic of mineral resource development. Traditional optimization approaches to supply chain design typically rely on accurate estimates of resource availability and treat uncertainty around these estimates through scenario analysis or stochastic programming [21]. However, these methods fail to capture the dynamic nature"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "This section reviews literature on uncertainty characterization in mineral supply chains and sequential decision-making frameworks, with emphasis on how existing approaches address geological uncertainty and information dynamics in resource development.\nCritical mineral supply chains face three primary sources of uncertainty that distinguish them from traditional industrial supply chains [23, 28]. The first and most distinctive is geological uncertainty, which fundamentally shapes the decision-making landscape in ways unique to mineral supply chains. This uncertainty stems from the inherent difficulty in accurately assessing subsurface mineral deposits [29], and unlike manufactured goods where production capacity can be estimated with relative certainty, mineral resources remain partially unknown until significant investment in exploration and extraction has occurred.\nGeological uncertainty gives rise to several interconnected forms of uncertainty that compound the complexity of resource assessment and development planning [23]. Resource quantity uncertainty affects our understanding of recoverable mineral volumes, while quality uncertainty influences the economic viability of extraction through variations in grade and composition. Spatial uncertainty impacts the distribution and accessibility of resources, affecting development costs and extraction strategies. Recovery uncertainty further complicates planning by introducing variability in extraction efficiency and processing yields."}, {"title": "3.

In such a case, $o$ is a vector of \u20131 values except for the site $j$ where the value is $v'_j$.

Here, $\\gamma \\in (0, 1)$ is the discount factor, which determines the relative importance of short-term versus long-term rewards. This factor is crucial for problems that deal with long-term planning, such as the lithium sourcing problem. Furthermore, $\\pi(b_t)$ is the policy that maps the belief $b_t$ to an action $a_t$. Here, a belief $b_t$ is a probability distribution over the state space, representing the agent's uncertainty about the true state of the environment at time $t$. For our problem, this is mainly due to the uncertainty in the geological reserves at each site, which is modeled as a Gaussian distribution. At each time step, the agent updates its belief with the Kalman filter update equations using the noisy observation $o_t$ corresponding to the action $a_t$ taken at time $t$."}, {"title": "3.7. Belief Update", "content": "The belief update is performed at each time step to maintain an accurate representation of the agent's uncertainty about the true state of the environment. Given a prior belief $b$ and an observation $o$, the agent updates its belief to obtain the posterior belief $b'$. However, a meaningful belief update only occurs when the agent takes the EXPLORE action, as measurements are only available in this case. In other cases, the belief remains unchanged.\nIn this model, we use a Gaussian distribution as the belief representation. For each site $j$, the prior belief $b$ is $N(\\mu_j, \\sigma_j^2)$. Given that the noisy measurement $\\tilde{v}_j$ is also a Gaussian random variable, the posterior belief $b'$ is also a Gaussian distribution with mean and variance given by the Kalman filter update equations. At each Kalman update, the mean and variance of the posterior belief are updated as follows [24]:\n$$ \\mu'_j = \\mu_j + K_j(\\tilde{v}_j - \\mu_j), $$\n$$ \\sigma'^2_j = (1 - K_j) \\sigma^2_j, $$\nwhere $K_j$ is the Kalman gain, calculated as\n$$ K_j = \\frac{\\sigma^2_j}{\\sigma^2_j + \\sigma_o^2}. $$\nHere, $\\sigma_o$ is the observation noise representing the uncertainty in the measurements process. The posterior belief for site $j$ after Explore$_j$ action is therefore $b' = N(\\mu'_j, \\sigma'^2_j)$. The belief update mechanism allows the agent to maintain an accurate representation of the true state of the environment and make informed decisions based on the available information.\nArguably, the belief update mechanism is the most valuable aspect of the POMDP framework to address geological uncertainty in mineral exploration. It enables the agent to adjust the exploration strategy based on the available information and make informed decisions about where to explore next. In contrast, classical optimization approaches that rely fully on the initial estimate of the reserves are not able to adjust the exploration strategy on the fly, and are therefore not able to take advantage of the information obtained from the exploration actions. We will show via numerical experiments that this is crucial to achieve a good performance for long-term critical mineral supply chain planning."}, {"title": "4.

We also have a binary variable for each site at each time step, representing whether the site is operational or not, and integer variables for the amount of LCE extracted from each site (imported or domestically mined) as well as the amount of LCE processed at the plant. The objective is then to maximize the (linearized) weighted objective over the planning horizon.\nFor the Monte Carlo-based STOCHASTIC optimization approach, we sample $N = 1000$ scenarios from the uncertainty distribution of the reserves.

Achieving Critical Minerals Self-Sufficiency", "content": "Our results highlight the importance of balanced investment in domestic mining capacity. The POMDP policies (DESPOT and POMCPOW) suggest starting domestic mining around year 11 (see Figure 7), slightly later than the other approaches which start mostly in year 10 (see Figure 5). This slight delay allows for better information gathering while still maintaining high processing volumes (around 9,300 Mt) and low unfulfilled demand (\u2264 1.27%).\nThe IMPORT-ONLY policy's poor performance (processing only about 4,500 Mt) demonstrates the risks of overreliance on foreign sources (see Figure 6). However, the success of POMDP approaches in achieving low CO$_2$ emissions (229-340 Mt compared to 526 Mt for GREEDY) shows that domestic production can be environmentally responsible when properly optimized."}, {"title": "5.3. Policy Implications", "content": "The results highlight several critical considerations for the US lithium supply chain strategy. Most of the policies initiate foreign mining right away to fulfill immediate demands (Figure 5-7). Soon after that, POMDP policies (POMCPOW and DESPOT) start advocating for domestic explorations, suggesting that early investment in the form of exploration in potential sites to obtain better reserve estimates may be optimal in the long run despite higher initial costs (see Figure 8). This contrasts with the current U.S. approach of heavy reliance on imports with minimal domestic exploration. POMDP policies also suggest that the U.S. does not necessarily need to build domestic mining immediately when the infrastructure is ready (at year 10), but could still delay a little bit if foreign imports can still satisfy demands (and start at years 11 and 15). However, the key insight is that infrastructure and accurate reserve estimates (from early investments in R&D and explorations) should be in place to allow rapid domestic mining establishments when needed.\nWe also note that the mining rates we set in this study might be a bit higher than what is currently available in practice. This mining rate scenario indicates that investment in mining technology and efficiency is crucial for achieving supply chain independence for critical minerals in the U.S. The IMPORT-ONLY policy, while showing lower immediate costs, exposes vulnerabilities in supply chain security in the long run. Furthermore, both optimized POMDP policies still require domestic lithium projects later in the years. Therefore, similar projects, like Thacker Pass, where permitting delays have impacted development timelines, require careful attention and collaboration between environmentalists, policymakers, and key industry players.\nIt is also important to note that while our simulation study results support domestic production expansion, they also indicate the continued importance of maintaining diverse supply sources by strengthening partnerships with allies like Australia, investing in joint technology development initiatives, and more importantly, proactive collaborations among key stakeholders to ensure long-term sustainability. Policies that support sustainability aims such as carbon pricing or incentives to encourage cleaner extraction methods, investment in renewable energy for mining operations, and development of recycling infrastructure to reduce primary production needs (see e.g., [7]) still play a major role in offsetting mining carbon footprints.\nFinally, we note that our research offers only a starting point for ways to integrate geological uncertainty in the strategic decision-making of critical mineral supply chains. We only use synthetic data to illustrate the potential use cases. Future research could explore more practical policymaking approaches supported with more realistic datasets. Also, more granular policy scenarios, including varied carbon pricing schemes, different technological advancement trajectories, and alternative international partnership configurations, should be explored. Additionally, extending the analysis to consider potential disruptions from climate change impacts or geopolitical events could provide valuable insights for long-term policy planning. The framework presented here provides a foundation for such analyses, offering a quantitative approach to evaluating the complex tradeoffs inherent in critical mineral supply chain policy."}, {"title": "6.

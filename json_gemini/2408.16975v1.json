AlphaFold2, AlphaFold-Multimer, and the latest AlphaFold3\nrepresent significant strides in predicting single protein chains, protein complexes, and biomolecular\nstructures. While AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer are open-sourced, facilitating rapid and\nreliable predictions, AlphaFold3 remains partially accessible through a limited online server and has\nnot been open-sourced, restricting further development.\nTo address these challenges, the PaddleHelix team is developing HelixFold3, aiming to repli-\ncate AlphaFold3's capabilities. Leveraging insights from previous models and extensive datasets,\nHelixFold3 achieves accuracy comparable to AlphaFold3 in predicting the structures of the\nconventional ligands, nucleic acids, and proteins. The initial release of HelixFold3 is avail-\nable as open source on GitHub for academic research, promising to advance biomolecular re-\nsearch and accelerate discoveries.

AlphaFold2 [1], AlphaFold-Multimer [2], and AlphaFold3 [3], achieve breakthrough progress in\nthe prediction of single protein chains, protein complexes, and biomolecular structures. Both AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-\nMultimer have fully open-sourced their codes, significantly accelerating protein-related research by providing rapid and\nreliable predictions. These tools not only enhance our understanding of protein functions and interactions, but also\nexemplify the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in solving complex scientific challenges.\nAlphaFold3, the latest in the series, supports biomolecular interaction predictions and offers an online server \u00b9 for\nlimited structural prediction services. This server allows researchers to utilize its advanced capabilities, although it\ncannot support arbitrary biomolecular structure predictions and imposes a daily limit on the number of predictions.\nFurthermore, AlphaFold3 has not yet been open-sourced, limiting its accessibility for widespread use and further\ndevelopment by the scientific community.\nReplicating AlphaFold3's capabilities presents significant opportunities for advancing the life sciences but involves\nsubstantial challenges due to the model's complexity, data requirements, and the extensive computational resources\nneeded for training.\nThe PaddleHelix team is working on HelixFold3 with the objective of replicating the advanced capabilities of Al-\nphaFold3. Our approach is informed by insights from the AlphaFold3 paper and builds on our prior work with HelixFold\n[4], HelixFold-Single [5], HelixFold-Multimer [6], and HelixDock [7]. For training, we utilized targets from the Protein"}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "We begin by evaluating the performance of HelixFold3 in multiple datasets. For ligands, we utilize the PoseBusters\nbenchmark [9] to assess precision and physical plausibility. For nucleic acids, HelixFold3 is evaluated on CASP15\n[10] RNA targets and recent RNA and DNA structures from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) [8]. We also\nassessed the model's precision for protein structure predictions on CASP15 protein targets. Each sample is processed\nwith 5 different random seeds, and diffusion inference is performed 5 times per seed with 200 sampling steps. The most\naccurate predictions are selected based on their confidence scores.\nIn addition, we investigate the effectiveness of confidence metrics in evaluating prediction quality. This involves\nanalyzing how well the confidence scores correlate with the actual accuracy of predictions across various datasets. We\nalso explore how different factors impact prediction quality, including the number of random seeds, diffusion inference\niterations, and the number of sampling steps in the diffusion process. This comprehensive analysis aims to refine our\nunderstanding of how these parameters influence the reliability of the prediction."}, {"title": "2.1 Ligands", "content": "We first compare HelixFold3 and the baseline methods in PoseBusters [9] to evaluate the quality of the protein-ligand\nstructure predictions. The PoseBusters dataset, a benchmark for ligand docking algorithms, initially had 428 structures\n(PoseBusters V1). After excluding data points with ligands within 5.0\u00c5 of multiple biological units, it was refined to 308\nstructures (PoseBusters V2). The baseline methods can be classified into three groups: methods with no ground-truth\nprotein structure specific, methods with holo protein structure specified, and methods with pocket residues specified.\nThe comparison of the success rate for PoseBuseters V1 and PoseBuseters V2 is shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b.\nEven though no ground-truth protein structure is specified, HelixFold3 achieves a high success rate, surpassing methods\nthat rely on given homo protein structures. Its prediction accuracy is comparable to that of AlphaFold3, highlighting\nits strong performance in predicting protein-ligand interactions. Due to the overlap between the training data for\nHellixFold3 and PoseBusters, there is a risk of overestimating HelixFold3's performance. To address this, we evaluated\nthe average success rate on 290 samples that do not overlap with the training data. This analysis showed only a 2%\nreduction in performance, suggesting that HelixFold3 maintains strong accuracy in predicting ligand-protein interface\nstructures.\nTo evaluate the stereochemistry and physical plausibility of the predicted ligand structures, including intra- and\nintermolecular measurements, we used the PoseBusters test suite [9]. As shown in Figure 1c, HelixFold3, AlphaFold3,\nand HelixDock all achieve pass rates above 90% for nearly all metrics, with the exception of tetrahedral chirality."}, {"title": "2.2 Nucleic Acids", "content": "Accurately predicting the structure of nucleic acid targets in a fully automated manner, without human input, remains\na formidable challenge, primarily due to the limited availability of crystallized nucleic acid structures. To evaluate\nHellixFold3's capabilities in this domain, we conducted a comparative analysis against several baseline methods, starting\nwith RNA targets from CASP15 [10], using the evaluation framework established by AlphaFold3. Figure 2a illustrate a\ncomparison between HelixFold3 and the baseline methods, showcasing the average RNA LDDT across 12 targets as\nwell as the RNA LDDT for each individual target. While HelixFold3's accuracy on CASP15 RNA samples does not yet"}, {"title": "2.3 Proteins", "content": "For protein-protein complex structure prediction, AlphaFold-Multimer represents a significant advancement over earlier\nmodels, though its success rate and accuracy still have room for improvement. AlphaFold3 further enhances these\ncapabilities, delivering superior predictive performance. We analyzed 186 protein complexes released in the PDB from\nJanuary 19, 2022, to November 30, 2022 to assess HelixFold3 and the competitive methods. As depicted in Figure 3,\nHellixFold3 has already outperformed AlphaFold-Multimer in predicting protein-protein interfaces, yet a gap remains\nbetween HelixFold3 and AlphaFold3. To address this, ongoing research will concentrate on targeted optimizations\nand iterative refinements of HelixFold3, with the aim of achieving greater accuracy and reliability in protein-protein\ncomplex predictions."}, {"title": "2.4 Model Confidence", "content": "Confidence scores from structure prediction models are essential for assessing the accuracy of their predictions.\nHellixFold3 employs several confidence metrics, including pLDDT, pAE, and pTM, to evaluate its predictions. We\nperformed a correlation analysis between these confidence scores and the actual accuracy of predicted structures using\ndata from protein complexes. HelixFold3 generated confidence scores for datasets, including small molecule ligand-\nprotein interactions from PoseBusters, as well as protein-protein complexes, RNA molecules, and DNA molecules\ncollected from the PDB. Across all these datasets, we observed a strong correlation between the confidence scores and\nthe structural accuracy (Figure 4), indicating the reliability of these metrics in evaluating prediction quality."}, {"title": "3 Conclusion", "content": "Our team is rigorously developing HelixFold3 to replicate the capabilities of AlphaFold3. We reported our current\nprogress, which shows that HelixFold3's accuracy on conventional ligands, nucleic acids, and proteins is approaching\nthat of AlphaFold3. The inference code and current version of model parameters of HelixFold3 are open-sourced on\nGitHub to facilitate its use by researchers.

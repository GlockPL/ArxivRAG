Traffic track witnesses complicating deep learning models, e.g., to push the prediction a few percent more accurate, and the incident track only studies the incidents alone, e.g., to infer the incident risk. We, for the first time, spatiotemporally aligned the two tracks in a large-scale region (16,972 traffic nodes) over the whole year of 2023: our XTraffic dataset includes traffic, i.e., time-series indexes on traffic flow, lane occupancy, and average vehicle speed, and incidents, whose records are spatiotemporally-aligned with traffic data, with seven different incident classes. Additionally, each node includes detailed physical and policy-level meta-attributes of lanes. Our data can revolutionalize traditional traffic-related tasks towards higher interpretability and practice: instead of traditional prediction or classification tasks, we conduct: (1) post-incident traffic forecasting to quantify the impact of different incidents on traffic indexes; (2) incident classification using traffic indexes to determine the incidents types for precautions measures; (3) global causal analysis among the traffic indexes, meta-attributes, and incidents to give high-level guidance of the interrelations of various factors; (4) local causal analysis within road nodes to examine how different incidents affect the road segments' relations.

Primarily, conducting myriad traffic analysis relies on two types of data: traffic and incident data. Traffic data encompasses the traffic state-related time-series, e.g., volume, speed, and occupancy rate on the road network over time. This continuous stream of data is essential for forecasting the future volume, understanding peak usage times, and optimizing traffic signals and routes [14, 23]. Real-time traffic data allows for dynamic adjustments to be made, enhancing the efficiency of traffic flow and reducing overall travel times. On the other hand, incident data includes information about traffic accidents, road closures, and unexpected events that can significantly affect traffic flow. This data helps in understanding the impact of such incidents on traffic congestion and travel time, facilitating more accurate predictions and enabling timely responses from traffic"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Preliminary of Four Intended Tasks", "content": "Traffic Forecasting is to predict traffic indexes at nodes within a road network based on historical data collected by sensors at each node. Consider a traffic road network represented as a graph G = (V, E), where V denotes the set of N traffic nodes, with |V| = N, and E represents the set of undirected edges. An edge Eij = 1 indicates a physical connection between nodes i and j in the road network; otherwise, Eij = 0. Traffic volume data is recorded by sensors in evenly spaced time intervals and can be represented as a sequence of matrices (X1, X2, ..., XT) \u2208 RN\u00d7T, where Xt is the matrix of volume signals (x1, x2, ..., x) at time slot t for all N nodes.\nThe goal in traffic flow forecasting is to devise a function F\u2081 that uses the observed traffic data from T\u2081 time slots to predict the traffic volumes for the subsequent T2 time slots: (Xt-T\u2081+1, ..., Xt) \uc8fc (xt+1, ..., Xt+T2), where Xt+1 represents the prediction at time t + 1, and a general loss function is defined as: min \u2211 L1(X\u00b2, X\u00b2).\nIncident Classification is to identify traffic incidents using traffic indexes. Since traffic sensors are not always available at the site of an incident, for brevity, we associate the parameters in the nearest single sensor to classify an incident, rather than aggregating data from multiple neighboring sensors. For the i-th paired sample (Xi, yi) in the dataset D, X \u2208 RC\u00d7w is the input and y\u012b represents its corresponding label, where C denotes the number of multivariate feature channels (e.g., speed and flow) and w indicates the time window at the post-incident timing t. There is X = {xt, xt+1,...,xt+w-1} and the j-th entity xt+i \u2208 RC. The classification task is: \u0177\u2081 = F2(X; \u04e8), where \u0177\u2081 is the predicted result, F2 is the classifier, and is trainable parameters. The overall objective is to minimize the classification loss L2 (e.g., cross-entropy) on D: mine \u2211 L2(F2(X; \u04e8), Yi).\nCausal Analysis and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) In causal analysis, the primary objective is to elucidate the causal relationship, which is represented in a dynamic acyclic graph (DAG). Within a DAG, each node corresponds to a variable, and each directed edge delineates a causal relationship between two variables. The causal structural model enables the representation of a node's distribution wi through wi = fi(Wpai, ei), where Wpa; denotes the set of all parents of node wi, and ei represents the exogenous noise associated with node wi. We consider two subtasks:\n(1) Global Causal Analysis for The Whole System: In global causal analysis, we focus on the problem that macro-level phenomena influence each other, such as the impact of weather on accident rates. Therefore, each node within the graph represents distinct variables like weather conditions, traffic accidents, or overall traffic statistics. This approach helps in understanding the broader implications of various environmental and systematic factors on traffic dynamics.\n(2) Local Causal Analysis for Road Relations: In local causal analysis, we focus on the temporal dependency structure underlying the complex traffic road network. We aim to find a graph G where the nodes are the variables representing traffic nodes at different lag-times and the links represent lagged or contemporaneous causal dependencies between traffic nodes. This approach helps in understanding how topologic of the road network affects traffic conditions."}, {"title": "2.2 Related Work of Traffic and Incident Analysis", "content": "Traffic Forecasting with Incidents Considered.\nA large number of works, e.g., STGCN[53], STGODE[7], DSTAGNN[19], are proposed to improve the prediction accuracy based on GNN [50] and RNN [39] models. However, these works only consider historical traffic for future traffic, yet other critical impacts, e.g., incidents and meta-features are ignored ([54, 18, 45, 30] offer detailed reviews in traffic forecasting). There are a few works that have considered incidents when predicting, whose main design is incorporating incident-related embedding as auxiliary information into traditional spatiotemporal prediction framework [51, 12, 31, 16]. For example, DIGC-Net [51] inputs the type and duration of the incident to predict the affected speed. Yet, the dataset only brings one week of incident data (17-24 Apr 2019) from a"}, {"title": "3 XTraffic Datacube", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Comparison with Existing Datasets", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2 Collection and Construction", "content": "Both incident and traffic data are collected from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PEMS). For traffic data, we removed the sensor with less than 50% observations of traffic volume and reserved the data of 16,972 sensors with meta-features. These sensors are located in 42 different cities and counties. We also collected comprehensive meta-features of these sensors. After excluding the features with the same value and features unrelated to traffic, 26 meta-features are reserved. These meta-features can be divided into 5 types as shown in Table 1. Full meta-features are in Table 6, Appx. A.1. As most methods in traffic forecasting are graph-based, the adjacency matrix is a key component for the model to learn spatial dependency. Typically, the adjacency matrix is constructed based on distance [30]. In order to get the real travel distance, we set up an open-source rooting machine engine [33] based on OpenStreetMap, and calculate the shortest travel distance between two sensors based on the coordinate. One more precise adjacency matrix is constructed based on the direction of the lanes and the coordinates of two sensors A and B.\nFor incident data, we removed repeated incident records and the records without absolute postmile (indicating the position and date-time). As the source and CA PM (we have Abs PM to locate the incident) are relatively redundant in the traffic analysis, thus also being removed. The reserved incident data includes 476,766 samples with 9 features. Identifying which nodes are impacted by an incident is crucial for leveraging incident records in traffic analysis. To facilitate this, we use a method that combines the freeway name and absolute postmile (Abs PM) markers to pinpoint sensors that might be affected by the incident. We provide two methods for this matching process: (1) involves matching only the nearest sensor on the same freeway as the incident, (2) involves setting a distance threshold and incorporating all sensors within this specified range."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Descriptive Analysis of XTraffic", "content": "(1) Different surfaces affect the traffic indexes: The traffic volume, occupancy, and speed vary sig-nificantly across different surface materials. In Fig. 2(a), the Base & surface < 7\" thick show distinct patterns (especially in volume and occupancy) compared to Bridge deck and Concrete surfaces, indicating that surface type influences traffic behavior. (2) Incidents affect the traffic indexes: In Fig. 2(b), traffic incidents such as incident 1141 cause noticeable disruptions and significant drops in traffic flow. (3) Long-tail of incident durations: Fig. 2(c) summarizes the distribution of incident durations, revealing a long-tail distribution where most incidents are relatively short, but a few incidents last for an extended period. It also demonstrates the geographical distribution of incidents, with higher concentrations in urban areas.

However, their performance under irregular volumes caused by incidents has not been thoroughly discussed. To assess these models' response in such conditions, we conduct irregular traffic forecasting based on XTraffic.\nExperiment Setting: We selected prediction samples from the test set that one incident occurred within a 5-minute window. We divided all the data into training, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio. Due to the large volume of data, we chose to conduct experiments using traffic volume data from the San Bernardino (561 mainline sensors) within the XTraffic dataset for the first 3 months. All of the baselines are state-of-the-art in the spatial-temporal forecasting or traffic forecasting domain. Our forecasting experiments were implemented within the same software framework employed by [30]. We further adhered to the identical experimental settings outlined within the work. We set the batch size as 24 for DSTAGNN and 64 for all of other models. The learning rate is set as 0.001. Other hyperparameters of models are set as the same as the original settings.\nResults. As shown in Table 3, all baselines perform significantly better in predicting on the general test dataset compared to the incident test dataset, since incidents added irregularity into the traffic systems. This suggests that investigating how to improve the performance of forecasting models on time series prediction following an incident is worth-while and warrants further research and discussion.

In this work, a time series classification task is designed on XTraffic, which involves inferring incident categories based on the traffic parameters during particular time slots detected by the sensors.\nExperimental setting. Since traffic sensors are not always available at the site of an incident, we start by identifying the nearest sensor affected by each incident according to the distance (i.e., the ABS PM in Table 6). Then, we extract recorded indexes (traffic speed, lane occupancy, and traffic flow) in these sensors during a time window when the incident occurs.

We propose a pioneering traffic and incident dataset XTraffic. It integrates traffic flow data with incident records and road comprehensive meta-features, filling a significant gap in traffic analysis and Incident analysis. XTraffic lays a solid groundwork for research focused on understanding traffic dynamics, causality, and interrelationships. Through four groups of experiments, we demonstrate that our dataset offers expanded possibilities for research in traffic forecasting, incident classification, and detection, as well as causal analysis.\nLimitation and future work.Our dataset currently faces three primary limitations. Firstly, weather data is crucial for traffic and incident analysis; however, our dataset lacks well-integrated weather information for use. Secondly, while we can locate specific incident locations relatively precisely using absolute PM values and road names, this method is less effective for visualization compared to using latitude and longitude coordinates. Lastly, there are still gaps in our traffic data. In response to these issues, we plan to enhance our dataset by collecting more comprehensive weather data. Additionally, we will use OpenStreetMap to analyze and generate precise geographical coordinates for incidents.

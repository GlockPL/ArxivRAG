{"title": "Exploring the Use of ChatGPT for a Systematic Literature Review: a Design-Based Research", "authors": ["Qian Huang", "Qiyun Wang"], "abstract": "ChatGPT has been used in several educational contexts, including learning, teaching and research. It also has potential to conduct the systematic literature review (SLR). However, there are limited empirical studies on how to use ChatGPT in conducting a SLR. Based on a SLR published, this study used ChatGPT to conduct a SLR of the same 33 papers in a design-based approach, to see what the differences are by comparing the reviews' results, and to answer: To what extent can ChatGPT conduct SLR? What strategies can human researchers utilize to structure prompts for ChatGPT that enhance the reliability and validity of a SLR? This study found that ChatGPT could conduct a SLR. It needs detailed and accurate prompts to analyze the literature. It also has limitations. Guiding principles are summarised from this study for researchers to follow when they need to conduct SLRs using ChatGPT.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "A systematic literature review (SLR) is \u201ca research methodology to collect, identify, and critically analyze the available research studies (e.g., papers, conference proceedings, books, dissertations) through a systematic procedure\u201d (Carrera-Rivera, Ochoa, Larrinaga, & Lasa, 2022, p2). It advances evidence-based knowledge by synthesizing common themes and trends in existing studies over a period of time (Kitchenham et al., 2009; Moher et al., 2009) and identify research gaps for future studies (Gough, Oliver, & Thomas, 2017).\nHowever, doing an SLR is a highly labour intensive and time-consuming task in framing clear research questions and developing effective strategies for literature search and analysis (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2018; Sliverman, 2021). The recent generative Al (GAI) tools like ChatGPT have promising affordances in reading papers and summarizing common themes. It seems that they have great potential in helping researchers do the SLR.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no empirical study has been conducted to explore how to use GAI like ChatGPT to do an SLR. Some existing conceptual papers have presented the idea of using ChatGPT to do literature reviews but no one has explored and published papers on how to do it in practice (Haman & \u0160koln\u00edk, 2023; Waseen, Ahmad, Liang, & Fahmideh, 2023). Therefore, this study was initiated to explore how to effectively use ChatGPT to do an SLR. More specifically, this study aims to answer the following research question:\nCan ChatGPT carry out a systematic literature review? If so, how?"}, {"title": "ChatGPT", "content": "ChatGPT, developed by OpenAl, represents a significant advancement in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. Its origins trace back to the introduction of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, with GPT-3, released in June 2020, being a notable predecessor that set the groundwork for large-scale language models. ChatGPT specifically was designed to improve interaction with Al, offering users the ability to engage in conversational dialogue, ask questions, receive answers, and even generate content across various formats and styles. It utilizes deep learning techniques to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives.\nThe transition from ChatGPT 3.5 to GPT-4.0 marked a pivotal evolution, introducing significant enhancements in understanding, context awareness, and generative abilities. ChatGPT 3.5 improved conversational interactions across various applications, while GPT-4.0, unveiled in early 2023, advanced these capabilities further, offering nuanced, contextually accurate responses and a closer approximation to human-like reasoning. This progression underscores OpenAl's dedication to refining Al technologies, aiming to make them more effective, creative, and user-friendly, thus expanding their utility in daily tasks and professional fields alike.\nChatGPT is a language generating tool. It is useful for generating a text description or improving writing (Wu et al., 2023). In addition to language learning, ChatGPT also has great potential in other aspects of education. In the existing literature, researchers have identified some potential benefits of using ChatGPT in education. For instance, it can design quizzes (Eysenbach, 2023, Jahic, Ebner & Sch\u00f6n, 2023); promote active learning because learners need to refine the answers ChatGPT generated based on their understanding (Shoufan, 2023); strengthen collaborative learning (Cotton, Cotton, & Shipway., 2023); promote personalized learning, especially for learners with disabilities (Cotton et al., 2023); provide immediate feedback and personlized learning (Kuhail et al., 2022); serve as writing assistant (Jahic et al., 2023); help with data analysis in research (Hwang & Chen, 2023, Kooli, 2023).\nHowever, it also has some challenges. For instance, learners may be trained as being lack of the ability to generate original ideas and be critical (Arif, Munaf, & Ul-Haque, 2023; Choi, Lee, Ho., Kwok, & Lok, 2023; Kooli, 2023); learning process changed (Qi, Zhu, & Wu, 2023); it may cause misinterpretation in research (Kooli, 2023); Ethical issues, for instance, the authorship in academic writing (da Silva, 2023, Zhang & Zhen, 2023), plagiarism (Jahic et al., 2023). The existing literature has also made some suggestions for the use of ChatGPT in education, for instance, need the correct prompts to generate the answers (Thakur,"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "As an exploratory study, this study aimed to investigate how to use ChatGPT to conduct an SLR for the purpose of generating equivalent results to the outcome of an original literature review (OLR) accomplished by the Wang and Huang (2023). In the OLR, 33 papers were systematically selected by following the PRISMA flowchart and deliberately analysed and synthesized. The findings were presented based on two research questions: 1) What challenges are involved in BSL that cause the low engagement of online learners? 2) What strategies are used to address the challenges and increase the engagement of online learners?\nIn the present literature review (PLR), the same papers were uploaded and analysed by ChatGPT-4.0 in the same way as in the OLR process. The two research questions were initially used as prompts to instruct GPT to generate review results. However, after testing with a few papers, we found that the generated result by GPT was unacceptable. For instance, GPT did not focus on the findings reported in the results section of each paper. But rather, it also reported points mentioned in the literature review section of a paper. To make the review findings more accurate, prompts were adjusted. After three rounds of major adjustment, ChatGPT could finally generate similar outcomes to those presented in the OLR.\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the OLR, two researchers read the 1st paper and discussed it. After reading 5 papers, they discussed the common challenges and strategies. Later, they discussed and summarized after the 12th and 33rd papers. Similarly, in this PLR, the researchers instructed ChatGPT to generate review results at the same points."}, {"title": "The Iterative Processes", "content": "In this section, the implementation process, results, and improvement in each round are described to illustrate how ChatGPT gradually improved review results.\nRound 1\nProcess\nThe literature analysis process with ChatGPT was initially identical to that of OLR. A researcher uploaded the 1st paper onto ChatGPT 4.0 via its Plugin named \u201cAi PDF\". The initial prompt used were the two research questions as follows:\n(Prompt) Please read the paper and answer the following two questions: What challenges are involved in Blended Synchronous Learning that cause the low engagement of online learners? What strategies are used to address the challenges and increase the engagement of online learners?\nAs shown in Figure 3, ChatGPT could summarise strategies, indicating it had high potential to perform an SLR. Subsequently, ChatGPT was further tasked to continue reading four additional papers. The researcher instructed GPT to summarise the common challenges and strategies of the first 5 papers by using the following prompt:\n(Prompt) For challenges, any common themes from these 5 papers? and for strategies, any common themes?\""}, {"title": "Results and Analysis", "content": "The generated results of the 12 papers are shown in Figure 6. It displays the challenges and strategies. It seemed that the generated table was well structured. However, the results had some issues.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the generated results confirmed that ChatGPT could do an SLR. However, it seemed that the generated results from the 3rd paper (as illustrated in Figure 5) were not accurate. For instance, one challenge summarized by GPT was: \u201cUnmet Expectations: Early studies evaluating the effectiveness of educational use of VC indicated that it had not yet met participants' expectations.\u201d Clearly, this challenge was obtained from the \"literature\" section but not from the results of the paper.\nTo further confirm the review accuracy, we further instructed ChatGPT to generate common challenges and strategies after analysing 12 papers by creating a table. The next section presents the results."}, {"title": "Round 2", "content": "Revised Process\nTo address issue 1, prompts were adjusted by narrowing down to specific sections and page range. For instance, we used prompts like \u201cPlease read pages 5-14\" to instruct GPT to focus on the \u201cFinding/Results\" section of the 1st paper.\n(Revised Prompt) Please read pages 5-14, and answer two questions: What challenges are involved in Blended Synchronous Learning that cause the low engagement of online learners? What strategies are used to address the challenges and increase the engagement of online learners?\nTo address issue 2, ChatGPT was prompted to analyse common challenges and strategies based on the interaction framework used in the OLR (Learner-learner, Learner-content, Learner-instructor).\n(New Prompt) Can you please categorize challenges into 1) learner-instructor interactions; 2) learner-learner interactions; 3) learner-content interactions?\nTo address issue 3, ChatGPT was prompted to report common challenges and strategies with page numbers.\nMoreover, ChatGPT was tasked to generate an overview on educational contexts, research methods, and design frameworks, as what we did in the OLR. The analysis scope was limited to the \u201cIntroduction\u201d and \u201cResearch Methodology\" sections of each paper. The next section shows the results of the 2nd round."}, {"title": "Results and Analysis:", "content": "Figure 7 shows the results after narrowing down to specific sections and page range. Satisfactorily, GPT did not include any information from the \u201cliterature\" section.\nFor the 2nd issue, GPT was prompts to analyze the common challenges and strategies based on the interaction framework. It seemed ChatGPT could analyse and categorize challenges and strategies based on the given framework, as illustrated in Figure 8."}, {"title": "Round 3", "content": "Revised Process:\nIn this round, two additional checkpoints (#18th and #25th) were added between the 12th and 33rd papers, to check if richer challenges and strategies could be generated after analysing fewer papers.\nTo address the issue of inaccurate page numbers, the following revised prompt was given to ChatGPT.\n(Revised Prompt): Give the actual page number shown in the paper, not the page number of PDF files.\nWe continued to instruct ChatGPT to analyse common challenges and strategies based on the framework (Learner-learner, Learner-content, Learner-instructor interaction. Moreover, we also asked GPT to provide examples for illustrating the results of each theme. For instance, the new prompt was as follows:\n(New Prompt): For the challenges: Technological Limitations and Interference, can you give me 1-2 examples from the 33 papers you read before?.\nResults and Analysis:\nAs shown in Figure 11, more common challenges and strategies were generated after analysing the 18th and 25th papers.\nIn addition, the final review results after analysing 33 papers, as shown in Figure 12, were highly consistent with that of the OLR."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "The main purpose of this exploratory study was to explore how to use ChatGPT to generate reliable systematic literature review results. In this section, key findings from the study are discussed and design principles are summarised.\nThis study confirms that ChatGPT can be a helpful tool for doing the SLR. It could rapidly analyse papers, extract relevant information, and summarise main findings into common themes. It could trace back to the content mentioned in each paper very quickly. It could provide direct quotes or examples. From this perspective, ChatGPT can function as a researcher assistant to help conduct a tentative literature review on a research topic.\nHowever, we also identified certain limitations when ChatGPT was used to do the systematic literature review. For instance, the reviewed papers were screened by the researchers. Presently ChatGPT has no access to academic databases, and cannot screen out papers that meet the criteria (Dwivedi et al., 2023). It still requires human researchers to identify suitable papers for analysis. Furthermore, ChatGPT cannot accurately identify exact page numbers from a PDF document. The page numbers ChatGPT identified were based on a single PDF document starting from Page 1, rather than the actual page of a journal paper. Researchers need to check the actual page number from the journal papers in person as references."}, {"title": "Guiding Principles", "content": "Based on the format suggested by van den Akker (1999), the guiding principles summarized from this study are presented as follows:\nIf you want to conduct a rigorous and effective systematic literature review using GPT, you are best advised to:\n\u2022\tscreen the reviewed papers first, for instance, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol (Moher et al., 2009).\n\u2022\tprovide highly detailed and precise instructions, specifying exactly what to do in each step of the process.\n\u2022\tdefine research questions and specify a theoretical or analytical framework for ChatGPT to complete a targeted and accurate SLR.\n\u2022\tprobide a page number range or specific portion/section of the paper due to its limitation in specifically identifying whether related information are from the \u201cLiterature\u201d or from the \u201cFindings\u201d.\n\u2022\tcheck page numbers in person.\n\u2022\tDocument the research process to avoid loss of records, as well as to record the prompts.\n\u2022\tlet ChatGPT read papers repeatedly, and triangulate with human beings. In this way, ChatGPT can become research assistants to enhance the efficiency and accuracy."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This study provides an empirical example of using ChatGPT-4.0 to do a systematic literature review. This paper describes how to increase the reliability of the review result after three rounds of analysis and improvement. The result shows that ChatGPT can conduct the SLR. However, it has limitations. In general, ChatGPT can serve as a Research Assistant(s) in helping with reading, analyzing and summarizing existing studies and the generated results can be used as a reference to allow researchers to have a quick understanding of the research in a certain area. The design principles summarized from this study can guide researchers in generating reliable review results."}]}

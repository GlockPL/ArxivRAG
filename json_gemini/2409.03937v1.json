Traditional OD prediction models, while effective within single cities, often face limitations when applied across different cities due to varied traffic conditions, urban layouts, and socio-economic factors.\nIn this paper, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new method for cross-city OD flow prediction. Our approach leverages the advanced semantic understanding and contextual learning capabilities of LLMs to bridge the gap between cities with different characteristics, providing a robust and adaptable solution for accurate OD flow prediction that can be transferred from one city to another. Our novel framework involves four major components: collecting OD training datasets from a source city, instruction-tuning the LLMs, predicting destination POIs in a target city, and identifying the locations that best match the predicted destination POIs. We introduce a new loss function that integrates POI semantics and trip distance during training. By extracting high-quality semantic features from human mobility and POI data, the model understands spatial and functional relationships within urban spaces and captures interactions between individuals and various POIs.

By capturing the flow of people, goods, or services between different locations within a geographic area, OD matrices provide critical insights into travel patterns, demand for infrastructure, and spatial interactions. Urban planners and policymakers utilize OD matrices to identify transportation bottlenecks, optimize transit routes, and allocate resources efficiently.\nGathering accurate and comprehensive data on travel movements within a geographic area can be time-consuming and costly. Data collection efforts may face challenges such as incomplete or inconsistent data, limited data availability for certain modes of transportation or population groups, and privacy concerns related to personal travel data.\nTraditional OD estimation models such as [18] and the Radiation Model [25] rely on the assumptions that flow of people or goods between two locations is proportional to their populations and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. They have been adapted to incorporate novel data sources such as social media check-ins [21], enhancing their adaptability.\nRecent learning-based models excel in capturing implicit data characteristics and delivering commendable performance [9, 36]. While effective in achieving their objectives, above works primarily focus on the OD flow generation within a single city. Some recent works [28] propose to generate trajectories across cities by learning traffic patterns and vehicle behaviors from data-rich cities and extrapolating this information to generate datasets for cities lacking such data. However, it heavily depends on the vehicle trajectory and road network datasets specific to the target city. Transferring the learned patterns from these datasets to different cities is challenging due to variations in traffic conditions and urban layouts among cities.\nLarge language models (LLMs) [3, 6, 8, 23, 24] have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks by recognizing patterns in vast datasets, enabling them to achieve high accuracy in various applications, from natural language processing to fields such as biomedical imaging and crop management [16, 33]. An interesting question is whether LLMs can understand and predict likely trip destinations based on a given point of interest and timeframe in the same way humans do. Has some base knowlege about trip behaviors learned across cities and once fine-tuned for flow prediction in one city and can be easily transfered to a different city? These capabilities hinge on the LLMs' ability to consider various factors and make informed guesses about trip destination as well as recognize patterns and associations in trip data. The main challenges of leveraging an LLM model are that: (1) the models were pre-trained on texts and do not have explict knowlege of OD flows; (2) The"}, {"title": "1.1 Our Contributions", "content": "In this paper, we propose a framework to investigate and harness large language models' capabilities in understanding trips for OD flow prediction across cities. Our approach is driven by the following premises: (1) despite the considerable variations in their trips across different cities, people travel for specific purposes and tend to follow similar patterns in their Origin-Destination POIs [11, 17] and (2) LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, including information about transportation, urban planning, and human behavior, and has basic understanding of city mobility patterns.\n\u25ba Contribution 1. We propse an LLM based Cross-city OD (LLM-COD) flow prediction framework. LLM-COD leverages the knowledge possed by LLMs and enhance it to infuse understanding of origin and destination related to point of interests, time, and distance. LLM-COD captures how people interact with various POIs in the city related to time.\n\u25ba Contribution 2. We develop a process to allow LLM-COD to transfer the knowledge to other cities and perform OD flow prediction with adaptation. We propose a new loss function that integrates POI semantics with distance which helps LLM-COD to achieve reboust performance across cities. This means that even with relatively limited training data for a new city, the model can utilize the knowledge and mobility patterns learned from other cities to improve prediction accuracy.\n\u25ba Contribution 3. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional models and state-of-the-art learning-based methods in cross-city OD flow prediction. LLM-COD reduces RMSE significantly compared to the best state-of-the-art model espcially for challenging high precision OD flow prediction (reduces by 46% for 1,000m \u00d7 1,000m) and is consistently better in all other commonly used metrics."}, {"title": "2 OVERVIEW", "content": "We consider a scenario where one city, referred to as \"City A\", possesses an Origin-Destination (OD) dataset, which includes the origin and destination points of various vehicle trips. In contrast, the other city, referred to as \"City B\", does not have access to the OD dataset. Our objective is to utilize the OD dataset from City A to train a generative model that can subsequently produce an OD dataset for City B.\nOur approach is motivated by the observation that, despite significant variations in individuals' trips across different urban environments-attributable to varied transportation modes and city layouts-people in different cities exhibit similar patterns in their Origin-Destination Points of Interest (POIs). For example, a universal OD pattern is the daily commute between residential areas and workplaces [15]. Additionally, educational institutions like schools, colleges, and universities serve as major OD points in cities, creating distinct travel patterns tied to the academic year, with weekdays seeing increased travel during morning and afternoon peaks.\nIn recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be highly effective in modeling and analyzing daily behavior patterns, owing to their ability to discern complex patterns from vast datasets [12]. The advancement of LLMs has notably transformed many fields and enabled deeper insights into human behavior and trends. An LLM is initially pre-trained on extensive data collections and subsequently adapted to address specific downstream tasks. While initial applications were focused on tasks such as language translation [31] and sentiment analysis [6], the scope of LLMs has broadened to include a variety of fields, including the prediction of human behavior [13].\nLeveraging the strong capability of LLMs to learn human behavior patterns, LLM-COD is designed to generate OD datasets across various cities. Figure 1 shows the framework of our approach, composed of the following four steps 1-4:\n\u2460OD POI training dataset collection (in City A): Given the OD vehicle trip dataset from City A, we construct an OD POI training dataset. Each sample in this dataset consists of inputs, which include a list of origin POIs and the associated timestamp, and outputs, which comprise a list of destination POIs and the permissible distance range between the origin and destination.\n\u2461Instruction fine-tuning of LLM: We take a pre-trained LLM (Llama2 + Gemma) and fine-tune the model using the OD training dataset created in 1. \u2461 leverages the general understanding and linguistic capabilities the LLM model has learned from a vast and diverse initial training phase and then narrows its focus to our OD POI generation problem.\n\u2462 Origin POI creation and their destination POI prediction (in City B): Assuming City B possesses the origin POIs"}, {"title": "3 METHODOLOGY", "content": "In this section, we detail the four steps for generating the OD dataset of City B based on City A (Section 3.2-Section 3.5), as outlined in Figure 1.

(Grid) City X is divided into $N^X$ square cells of equal size (e.g., 500m \u00d7 500m), denoted as $V^X = {v_1^X,...,v_{N^X}^X}$, where each $v_i^X$ represents the i-th grid cell in City X. The center coordinates of each grid cell are assumed to be known for both cities, as further discussed in Section 3.2.\nDefinition 3.2. (Spatial features) We consider K distinct types of POIs, detailed in Table 7 in the Appendix. Each grid cell $v_i^X$ (i = 1,..., $N^X$) can be characterized by a spatial feature vector $u_i^X$ = $[u_{i,1}^X,...,u_{i,K}^X]$, where each $u_{i,k}^X$ (k = 1,..., K) denotes the number of the k-th type of POIs in grid cell $v_i^X$. We use $U^X = {u_1^X,...,u_{N^X}^X}$ to represent the spatial features of the grid cells of City X.\nDefinition 3.3. (Trip Set) We represent each trip $l$ by a 4-tuple $(o_l^X, d_l^X, t_l, c_l)$, including its origin cell $o_l^X$, the starting time $t_l$, its destination cell $d_l^X$, and the acceptable traveling cost $c_l$. We use $T^X = {(o_l^X, d_l^X, t_l, c_l)}^L_{l=1,...,L^X}$ to represent the trip set of City X, where $L^X$ is the number of trips in $T^X$.\nDefinition 3.4. (Origin Set) The origin set of city X, denoted as $O^X$, is defined as the set of origin cells, along with their corresponding starting time points for the trips $T^X$ in City X, i.e., $O^X = {(o_l^X, t_l)}^L_{l=1,...,L^X}$.\nDefinition 3.5. (OD pair learning) Given an origin set $O^X$, OD pair learning is a process of predicting the destination $d_l^X$, and traveling cost $c_l$ of each $(o_l^X, t_l)$ \u2208 $O^X$, creating the corresponding trip $(o_l^X, d_l^X, t_l, c_l)$.\nDefinition 3.6.

[22] found the data exhibits a high correlation coefficient of 0.9 with the residential population, indicating a strong relationship between Tencent's location data and human activity patterns. This strong correlation suggests that Tencent's location-aware dataset can serve as a proxy for human activities on a short-time scale, making it suitable for defining origin cells in any city in China.\nGiven each generated origin POI distribution $u_{O_i^B}$, in City B and their corresponding timestamps $t_l^B$ as the inputs, the fine-tuned LLM (described by Equ.

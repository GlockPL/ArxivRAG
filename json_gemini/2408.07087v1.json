INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the contemporary web ecosystem, cloud services are fundamental, enabling interoperability among heterogeneous\nsoftware applications. The rapid expansion of cloud computing, e-commerce, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a\nproliferation of cloud services, resulting in a market oversaturation that complicates the selection process for users [1]-[3]. The\nevaluation of Quality-of-Service (QoS) data is paramount in this context, as it informs service selection based on attributes such\nas robustness, cost, and response time, which are assessed from both the user and server perspectives [4]-[7]. Recently,\nresearchers have delved into QoS estimation methods to accurately predicting unknown QoS values based on historical records.\nHowever, QoS matrices are often High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) due to the scarcity of achieved invocations compared\nto the total possible ones. In such scenario, Latent Feature Analysis (LFA) has garnered attention owing to its effectiveness in\nhandling a HDI matrix [1], [5]-[9]. LFA maps users and services into a latent feature space, leveraging these features to estimate\nmissing QoS data.\nIn practice, QoS values of cloud services often fluctuate over time as illustrated in Fig. 1, emphasizing the need to explore\ntemporal patterns. Hence, several dynamic LFA-based QoS estimators are proposed to capturing latent features based on a QoS\ntensor [10]-[20]. While existing methods for dynamic QoS estimation have demonstrated effectiveness, they cannot well capture\nthe spatiotemporal information in a uniform way. Specifically, they suffer from the following limitations: a) Incomplete\nRepresentation: They tend to separate the modeling of temporal and spatial patterns, which prevents unified handling of\ndynamic non-Euclidean structure and results in information loss, as shown in Fig. 1. b) Complex Learning Paradigm: For the\nunattributed graphs, they commonly construct attributes and apply complicated message propagation rules, which cannot learn\nexpressive latent features [21]-[24].\nWith the above findings, we pose the following Research Question (RQ): Is it possible to uniformly capture the\nspatiotemporal patterns implied in dynamic QoS data to perform effective LFA for accurately estimating the missing QoS values?\nTo answer it, this study develop a novel dynamic QoS estimator based on Spatiotemporal Coupling GCNs, named as SCG. The\nmodel is achieved with the three-fold ideas: a) building a novel graph convolution rule based on generalized tensor product\nframework [25]-[26]; b) combing the dynamic heterogeneous GCN layer with tensor factorization for effective learning to latent\nfeatures; and c) removing redundant message propagation operations to lower the training difficulties and improve learning\nefficiency. To be specific, this paper has the contributions as follows:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWe propose a novel dynamic GCN layer, capturing richer spatiotemporal information implied in QoS data, which can be\nextended to other downstream tasks.\nWe present a SCG model used for temporal-aware QoS estimation, which incorporates the proposed GCNs into tensor\nfactorization for accurate LFA.\nComprehensive empirical studies are conducted on two large-scale industrial QoS datasets, and the comparison results with\nseveral state-of-the-art methods demonstrate it can perform more accurate estimation."}, {"title": "II.

THE SCG MODEL", "content": "A. Dynamic GCNs based on Generalized Tensor Product\nThe normal graph convolution process is defined as [13]-[20], [25]-[32]:\n\\begin{equation}\n[x^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(\\hat{A}.x^{(l)} . W^{(l)}),\n\\hat{A} = \\tilde{D}^{-1/2} . (A+I).\\tilde{D}^{-1/2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere X(l) is the l-th layer feature matrix; A is the adjacency matrix; I is the identity matrix; D is the diagonal degree matrix,\nwhose each element di,i=1+\u2211jaij; W(l) is the l-th layer feature transformation matrix; and \u03c3(\u00b7) is the activation function, such as\nSigmoid. Now, given adjacency tensor A and feature tensor X, we aim to build a spatiotemporal GCN layer base on them. To\nachieve this, based on the calculation rules in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [25]-[26], we define the generalized tensor product\nused in our study, which involves three fundamental definitions as follows.\nDefinition 3-1. (\u0398-Transform). Given a tensor X|I|\u00d7|J|\u00d7|T| and a mixing matrix \u0398|I|\u00d7|J|\u00d7|T|, the \u0398-transform of X|I|\u00d7|J|\u00d7|T| is defined as\nX=Y|I|\u00d7|J|, where each element is given as:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_{i,j,t} = \\sum_{r=1}^{|T|} \\Theta_{i,j,r} X_{i,j,r}\n\\end{equation}\nDefinition 3-2. (Facewise Product). Two tensors X|I|\u00d7|J|\u00d7|T| and Y|J|\u00d7|K|\u00d7|T| are given, the facewise product between them is denoted\nas XOY=Z|I|\u00d7|K|\u00d7|T|, whose element is calculated as:\n\\begin{equation}\nZ_{ijt} = \\sum_{j=1}^{|J|}X_{ijtj,k,t}\n\\end{equation}\nDefinition 3-3. (\u0398-Product). Given two tensors X|I|\u00d7|J|\u00d7|T| and Y|J|\u00d7|K|\u00d7|T| and a mixing matrix \u0398|T|\u00d7|T|, the \u0398-product between X and\nY is calculated as X*Y=(X\u2297\u0398)O(Y\u2297\u0398)=Z|I|\u00d7|K|\u00d7|T|.\nBased on the above definitions, a single spatiotemporal GCN layer is achieved as:\n\\begin{equation}\nX^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(A*X^{(l)} * W^{(l)}),\n\\hat{A} = \\tilde{D}^{-1/2} \\odot (A+I) \\odot\\tilde{D}^{-1/2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the tensors are the extensions of the matrices in (1).\nB. Layer-Wise Graph Convolution on a QoS Tensor\nIn the task of QoS estimation, (4) is extended to build a dynamic heterogeneous GCN layer for message propagation on the\nbipartite user-service interaction graphs. Specifically, the following computations are given as:"}, {"title": null, "content": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&U^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(A*S^{(l)} *W^{(l)}),\\\\\n&S^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(\\hat{A}^T *U^{(l)} *B^{(l)}).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \u00c2T\u2208R|U|\u00d7R\u00d7|T| is the transposed tensor of A along the time dimension. It is worth noting that in (5), information flows\nbetween two distinct types of nodes: users and cloud services. This process captures high-order spatiotemporal connectivity\nthrough layer-by-layer computations.\nSince the initial input node features for (5) are obtained using tensor factorization, the essential parameter tensors to be\noptimized consist of U(0), S(0), W(0~L-1), and B(0~L-1), where L is the layer number. However, prior research on matrix factorization\nhas indicated that coupling such parameters can lead to increased training difficulty [5], [21]-[24]. And the accumulations of\nmultiple layers with nonlinear activations exacerbates issues related to gradient vanishing or explosion. Hence, we simplify the\nabove graph convolution on the QoS tensor to the following form as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&U^{(l+1)} = A*S^{(l)},\\\\\n&S^{(l+1)} = A^T * U^{(l)}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nOn the other hand, it is essential to carefully consider the set to the mixing matrix \u0398. The primary focus of this paper is not the\nintricate design of it. Therefore, in the interest of computational efficiency and overall estimation accuracy, we opt to design \u0398\nfor max(0, t-K)\u2264i\u2264min(|T], t+K) as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\theta_i = \\begin{cases}\n1 & i = \\min(2K+1,|T|-t+K +1,t + K),\\\\\n0 & otherwise.\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere K represents the temporal window size for perception, with the other elements in \u0398 set to zero. Based on this configuration,\nthe dynamic graph convolution process primarily captures spatiotemporal patterns over more proximate time intervals.\nC. Pooling Features for QoS Estimation\nBy performing multiple layers of graph convolutions, we obtain the latent feature tensors that encapsulate high-order\nspatiotemporal information. To further enhance the model's representation learning ability, we aggregate features from different\nlayers using a pooling function as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&U = P(U^{(0)}, U^{(1)}, U^{(2)},..., U^{(L)}),\\\\\n&S = P(S^{(0)}, S^{(1)}, S^{(2)},..., S^{(L)}),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere P() can be chosen as Concatenation, Sum, or Mean [5], [24], [28]. Based on the pooling node features, the estimated QoS\ntensor is achieved as:\n\\begin{equation}\nQ = U\\Theta S^T\n\\end{equation}\nFollowing prior studies, this paper employs the Euclidean distance to measure the errors between estimated values and true\nones. Consequently, we construct the objective function with an L2 regularization term on known entries of Q as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{E}(U^{(0)}, S^{(0)})\n= \\sum_{q_{us,t} \\in \\Lambda} (\\hat{q}_{ust}-q_{ust})^2 + \\lambda (\\|U^{(0)}\\|_{F}^{2}+\\|S^{(0)}\\|_{F}^{2}).\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \u03bb is the coefficient controlling regularization strength."}, {"title": "IV.

Albeit called \"knowledge\", it does not have to be the case. This is because, as defined in epistemology, knowledge is something that must be true and justifiable (Steup and Neta 2024). However, from the perspective of each single agent, it is hard to verify that the other agents are indeed rational. As discussed by Lewis (1969), what really matters in the reasoning process is the agents' rationality and belief about the other agents' rationality, the latter of which, unlike knowledge, is not necessarily true or justifiable. Indeed, in the discussion of epistemic game theory (Dekel and Siniscalchi 2015), the assumption of rationality and common belief in rationality (RCBR) serves as the foundation of the major solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium (Nash 1950), correlated equilibrium (Aumann 1987; Brandenburger and Dekel 1987), and rationalisability (Pearce 1984; Bernheim 1984).\nAs Lewis (1969) and Schiffer (1972) interpret, RCBR consists of the rationality of all agents and a belief hierarchy that contains all finite sequences in the form that \"a1 believes that a2 believes that a-1 believes that a\u017c is rational\", where a1, a2, ..., Ai-1, ai are (possibly duplicated) agents. Observe that RCBR can be expressed with a complete digraph. For instance, Figure 1(i) illustrates the RCBR among agents a, b, c, where each node represents the rationality of an agent and each path\u00b9 of at least two nodes corresponds to a sequence in the belief hierarchy of RCBR. Specifically, in Figure 1(i), the node labelled with a corresponds to the rationality of agent a; the path labelled with (b, c, b, a) corresponds to the belief sequence \"agent b believes that agent c believes that agent b believes that agent a is rational\". We denote this belief sequence by the tuple (b, c, b, a) henceforth. Notice that no self-loop exists due to the assumption that agents do not have introspective beliefs about their own rationality (Dekel and Siniscalchi 2015).\nYet, the RCBR assumption is too strong, especially in a system consisting of different types of agents. For example, when two adults a and b interact with a child c, who is too young to possess rationality (i.e. the ability to do mathematical optimisation), the RCBR assumption is satisfied only between a and b. Then, the belief hierarchy can be captured by Figure 1(ii). Notice that, the irrational agent c is not included in the graph because of the assumption that irrational agents act arbitrarily and do not possess beliefs about the other agents' rationality. This assumption also implies that a belief hierarchy about rationality should be \u201cprefix-closed\u201d. In other words, if agent a believes that agent b believes that agent c is rational, then agent a must believe that agent b is rational, the latter of which further implies that agent a must be rational. This property makes it possible to illustrate a belief hierarchy with a directed graph.\nNow we consider the situation that the child c, although young, is a genius. The adults a and b neglect the talent of c. But e not only is rational and believes in the RCBR between a and b, but also notices the arrogance of a and b. In this case, there is no RCBR among agents a, b, c, but there is more than RCBR between agents a and b. We illustrate the rationality and beliefs in rationality (RBR) in this system in Figure 1(iii). We shall call it the \u201cRBR graph\u201d among agents a, b, c. In this system, compared with the RCBR among a, b, c, there is no belief about the rationality of agent c. Meanwhile, compared with the RCBR between a and b, there are agent c's beliefs about the rationality and beliefs of a and b.\nLet us now consider another situation that, in the above case, the genius child c fails to identify the arrogance of a and b. Then, in c's belief, the RCBR among a, b, c still exists, which, however, is not the reality. In other words, the agents a and b in c's belief are not the real agents a and b in the system. We call such agents by doxastic agents, who exist in beliefs but are not real. In this case, we visualise the doxastic agents with dashed cycles as Figure 1(iv) shows. In this figure, the solid nodes labelled with a and b represent the real agents a and b between whom the RCBR exists, while the dashed nodes labelled with a and b represent the doxastic agents a and b, with whom agent c believes the RCBR exists. In this case, only the solid nodes represent the rationality of agents; only the paths starting at solid nodes (i.e. real agents) correspond to belief sequences in the system.\nIn this paper, we encode RBR systems with directed labelled graphs, as shown in Figure 1, based on which we study the agents' strategic behaviours. Notably, the existing literature on agents' beliefs concentrates on modelling the Bayesian beliefs of agents (i.e. agents' subjective probability distributions over the other agents' behaviours). On the contrary, the rationality of agents implies a dynamic \u201cbest-response\u201d process (Savage 1954) that cannot be captured by static distributions. Particularly, the type structure (Harsanyi 1967; Brandenburger and Dekel 1993) is used in epistemic game theory to implicitly model the hierarchy of Bayesian beliefs. It is a recursive formalisation of strategic behaviours based on the RCBR assumption, rather than a formalisation of beliefs in rationality. Meanwhile, the influence diagram (Koller and Milch 2003; Howard and Matheson 2005), a variant of the Bayesian network (Pearl 1988), is used in AI to model a decision system of agents. Due to its strength in modelling the probabilistic uncertainty, the influence diagram is also used to model Bayesian beliefs of agents (Milch and Koller 2000). However, the acyclic nature of the influence graph makes it impossible to model RCBR as the RBR graph does. More literature on modelling agents' beliefs can be seen in the review papers (Albrecht and Stone 2018) and (Doshi, Gmytrasiewicz, and Durfee 2020). As far as we know, no research on explicitly modelling uncommon RBR (i.e. not RCBR) of agents exists in the literature.\nContribution and Outline We first discuss how RBR works in agents' strategic reasoning process in Section 2. Then, in section 3, we formally define RBR graphs, a graph-based language to capture uncommon RBR systems, and (iterative) rationalisation, the strategic reasoning process of agents, based on which we propose doxastic rationalisability, a solution concept in uncommon RBR systems. After this, we discuss the equivalence of two RBR graphs in Section 4, based on which we design an algorithm that can compress any RBR graph to a minimal equivalent form in Section 5. Due to page limitation, we retain the formal defini-"}, {"title": "2 Rationality and Rationalisation", "content": "As defined by Savage (1954), a rational agent, when faced with uncertainty, first forms a subjective probability distribution over all possibilities, and then chooses a strategy that best responds (i.e. maximises the expected utility) to the subjective probability distribution. This is the commonly acknowledged definition of rationality in economics, game theory, and multiagent systems. Rationalisability (Pearce 1984; Bernheim 1984) is a solution concept to the question that \"what RCBR exactly implies\". In this concept, a strategy is rationalisable if it best responds to some subjective probability distribution. Rational agents take only rationalisable strategies. We call the process of finding rationalisable strategies rationalisation. It is a well-known result in game theory that, in a game with compact strategy sets and continuous utility functions, a (mixed) strategy is rationalisable if and only if it is not strongly dominated\u00b3 (Gale and Sherman 1950; Pearce 1984). In this situation, rationalisation exactly means the elimination of strongly dominated strategies. In other cases, the elimination of strongly dominated strategies implies\u2074 rationalisation but not the other way around. For example, B\u00f6rgers (1993) finds that, if the preference of agents on outcomes is a total order rather than defined as utility functions, then rationalisation is a concept weaker than \u201celiminating strongly dominated strategies\" but stronger than \"eliminating weakly dominated strategies\".\nSince our purpose in this paper is not to discuss the essence of rationality, we simplify the definition of rationalisation to the elimination of strongly dominated strategies in pure strategy space. We say that a rational agent chooses only pure strategies that are not strongly dominated by any pure strategy (see Section 3 for formal definitions). The benefit is threefold: first, it avoids the computational intractability in dealing with mixed strategy space and \"best response\" optimisation; second, it allows us to discuss a more general game frame where the preference of agents is just partial order; third, the simplified definition is more restrictive (but not too much) than those in the literature, so the technical results of this paper can potentially be extended to more general definitions using similar proof techniques but at the expense of mathematical complexity. Henceforth, by saying a strategy is dominated, we mean it is strongly dominated.\nTo see how rationality interacts with belief, let us consider the following simplified \u201cguess 2/3 of the average\" game (Moulin 1986; Nagel 1995):\nEach agent chooses an integer in the interval [1, 10]. The one whose choice is the closest to 2/3 of the average of the other agents' choices wins.\""}, {"title": "3 Terminologies and Solution Concept", "content": "In preparation for the study of the iterative rationalisation process in games among agents with uncommon RBR, we next formalise the concepts informally introduced in the previous sections. Throughout this paper, unless specified otherwise, we assume a fixed nonempty set A of agents. We start with a general definition of (strategic) games that uses partial orders (Osborne and Rubinstein 1994).\nDefinition 1 A game is a tuple $(\\Delta, \\preceq)$ such that\n1.  $\\Delta = {\\Delta_a}_{a\\in A}$, where $\\Delta_a \\neq \\emptyset$ is a finite strategy space for each agent $a \\in A$;\n2.  $\\preceq = {\\preceq_a}_{a\\in A}$, where $\\preceq_a$ is a partial order on the Cartesian product $\\prod_{b\\in A} \\Delta_b$.\nAn element $s_a \\in \\Delta_a$ is called a strategy of agent $a$. An outcome is a tuple $s \\in \\prod_{a\\in A} \\Delta_a$ consisting of a strategy for each agent $a \\in A$. Binary relation $\\preceq_a$ shows agent $a$'s preference over the outcomes. For two outcomes $s$ and $s'$, if $s \\preceq_a s'$ and $s' \\not\\preceq_a s$, then we write $s \\prec_a s'$ and say that agent $a$ strictly prefers outcome $s'$ to $s$. For example, in our simplified \"2/3 game\" in Section 2, the strategy space of each agent is all integers in the interval [1, 10]; an outcome is a collection of every agent's choice. An agent strictly prefers the outcomes where her choice is closer to her target.\nNote that, the commonly used definition of games where preference is defined via utility functions is a special case of Definition 1 in which preference $\\preceq_a$ is a total order for each agent $a \\in A$. In particular, $s \\preceq_a s'$ if $u_a(s) \\leq u_a(s')$, where $u_a(s)$ and $u_a(s')$ are utilities of agent $a$ toward outcome $s$ and $s'$, respectively.\nDefinition 2 For any agent $a \\in A$, a reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$ in the game $(\\Delta, \\preceq)$ is a Cartesian product $\\prod_{b\\in A\\setminus{a}} O_b$ such that $\\Delta \\subseteq O_b$ for each agent $b \\neq a$.\nA reasoning scene describes a static context in which a rational agent rationalises. It captures the uncertainty of an agent toward the other agents' strategies. In other words, given that every other agent $b$ may choose a strategy from set $O_b$, agent $a$ reasons about which strategies of her own are rationalisable. Recall that, when agents a, b, c with RBR in Figure 1(ii) play the simplified \u201c2/3 game\u201d, in the third rationalisation, agent a believes $X_b \\in [1,6]$ and $X_c \\in [1, 10]$, as column 2nd of lines (5-6) in Table 1 shows. In this situation, we say that agent a rationalises in the reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$ such that $O_a$ consists of all integers in the interval [1, 6] and $O_c$ consists of all integers in the interval [1, 10]. A tuple $s_{-a} \\in \\Theta_a$ is a combination of all agents' strategies except agent $a$ and thus $(s_{-a}, s_a)$ is an outcome.\nThe next definition formalises the notion of dominance as discussed in Section 2.\nDefinition 3 For a given reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$ of agent a and any strategies $s_a, s'_a \\in \\Delta_a$, strategy $s'_a$ dominates strategy $s_a$ if $(s_{-a}, s_a) \\prec_a (s_{-a}, s'_a)$ for each tuple $s_{-a} \\in \\Theta_a$.\nWe write $s_a \\prec^{\\Theta_a} s'_a$ if strategy $s_a$ is dominated by strategy $s'_a$ in the reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$. Note that, dominance relation is asymmetric (i.e. if $s_a \\prec^{\\Theta_a} s'_a$, then $s'_a \\not\\prec^{\\Theta_a} s_a$).\nThe next definition formalises the result of rationalisation in a given reasoning scene. It is in line with our simplified definition of rationalisation (i.e. the elimination of dominated strategies) as discussed in Section 2.\nDefinition 4 In reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$, the rational response of agent a is a set of strategies\n$R_a(\\Theta_a) := {s_a \\in \\Delta_a | \\neg \\exists s'_a \\in \\Delta_\\alpha (s_a \\prec^{\\Theta_a} s'_a)} .$\nIn other words, the set $R_a(\\Theta_a)$ consists of all rationalisable (i.e. not dominated) strategies of agent a in the reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$. Note that, $R_\\alpha (\\Theta_a) \\neq \\emptyset$ for any agent $a$ and any reasoning scene $\\Theta_a$ due to the asymmetry of dominance relation $\\prec^{\\Theta_a}$. Next, we formally define RBR graphs. In the rest of the paper, notation $nEm$ is short for $(n, m) \\in E$, notation $l_n$ is short for $l(n)$, and notation $\\pi_\\alpha$ is short for $\\pi(\\alpha)$.\nDefinition 5 An RBR graph is a tuple $(N, E, l, \\pi)$ where:\n1.  $(N, E)$ is a finite directed graph with set N of the nodes and set $E \\subset N \\times N$ of the directed edges;\n2.  $l : N \\rightarrow A$ is a labelling function such that for each node $n, m_1, m_2 \\in N$,\n(a) if $nEm_1$, then $l_n \\neq l_{m_1}$;\n(b) if $nEm_1, nEm_2$, and $l_{m_1} = l_{m_2}$, then $m_1 = m_2$;\n3.  $\\pi : A \\rightarrow N$ is a partial designating function such that for each agent a, if $\\pi a$ is defined, then $l_{\\alpha} = a$;\n4.  for each node $n \\in N$, there is an agent $a \\in A$ and a path from node $\\pi_a$ \u03c4o n."}, {"title": "4 Equivalence in RBR Graphs", "content": "Intuitively, if there is no other assumption than uncommon RBR, then an agent's strategic behaviour is only affected by her own belief. In this sense, if a (real or doxastic) agent always has the same strategic behaviour in two RBR systems, then we say that the agent has equivalent beliefs in these RBR systems. Note that, a (real or doxastic) agent is denoted by a node in RBR graphs. For simplicity, we say that two nodes are doxastically equivalent if the agents denoted by them have the same strategic behaviour in every game.\nFormally, we consider two nodes n and n' in two (possibly equal) arbitrary RBR graphs $B = (N, E, l, \\pi)$ and $B' = (N', E',l', \\pi')$, respectively. For an arbitrary game $G=(\\Delta, \\preceq)$, denote by $S(G) = {S(G)_m}_{m\\in N}$ and $S'(G) = {S'(G)_{m'}}_{m'\\in N'}$ the rational solutions of the game G on the RBR graphs B and B', respectively. Then, doxastic equivalence between nodes is defined as follows.\nDefinition 14 The nodes n and n' are doxastically equivalent if $S(G)_n = S'(G)_{n'}$ for each game G.\nRecall that, as discussed in Section 1, agent a in Figure 1(ii) and in Figure 1(iii) have the same belief: either of them believes that there is RCBR with agent b and agent c is irrational. The same goes with agent b in Figure 1(ii) and in Figure 1(iii), and agent c in Figure 1(i) and in Figure 1(iv).\nNote that, by \"the same belief\u201d we mean that the belief hierarchy (i.e. the set of belief sequences) is the same. In this sense, by saying that the agents denoted by nodes n and n' have the same belief, we mean $\\Psi^*_n = \\Psi^*_{n'}$.\nWe find that beliefs are equivalent if and only if they are the same, as formally stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 2 The nodes n and n' are doxastically equivalent if and only if $\\Psi^*_n = \\Psi^*_{n'}$.\nFor the \"only if\u201d part of Theorem 2, note that $\\Psi^*_n \\neq \\Psi^*_{n'}$ implies the existence of an integer k such that $\\Pi^k_n \\neq \\Pi^k_{n'}$, by Definition 6. Then, we show the existence of a parameterised game $G_k$ such that $S(G_k)_n \\neq S'(G_k)_{n'}$ (Definition 18 and Lemma 20 in Appendix C.1). For the \u201cif\u201d part of Theorem 2, we prove by induction that, for each integer $i \\geq 1$, after the ith rationalisation, $R^i_S(\\Delta)_n = R^i_{S'}(\\Delta)_{n'}$ in every game (Lemma 25 in Appendix C.2). Then, the \u201cif\u201d part statement of Theorem 2 follows from Theorem 1.\nNow, we consider the equivalence of RBR systems. Recall that an RBR system is a collection of the belief hierarchies of all real agents. The real agents are whom we care about. In this sense, we say that two RBR systems are equivalent if no real agents can distinguish them. In other words, every real agent should always have the same strategic behaviour in two equivalent RBR systems. Note that we use RBR graphs to denote RBR systems. Formally, we consider the equivalence of two arbitrary RBR graphs B and B'. For any game G, denote by $R(G) = {R(G)_a}_{a\\in A}$ and $R'(G) = {R'(G)_a}_{a\\in A}$ the doxastic rationalisabilities of the game G on the RBR graphs B and B', respectively.\nDefinition 15 The RBR graphs B and B' are equivalent if $R(G)_a = R'(G)_a$ for each agent $a \\in A$ and each game G.\nThe next theorem shows the necessary and sufficient condition for two RBR systems to be equivalent. That is, for each agent a, either a is irrational in both systems, or a is rational and has equivalent beliefs in both systems. In the RBR graphs, the former means that agent a is not in the domain of definition of the designating functions. The latter is formally expressed with the doxastic equivalence between the"}, {"title": "5 Minimisation of RBR Graphs", "content": "So far we have assumed that the RBR systems/graphs are given. However, in most situations, this is not the case. In behaviour economics, researchers study how to elicit the belief of a single agent (Schotter and Trevino 2014; Charness, Gneezy, and Rasocha 2021; Danz, Vesterlund, and Wilson 2022). In application scenarios, it is probably the same: we elicit the belief hierarchy of each agent in a system and combine their beliefs as a whole. For instance, to get the RBR system depicted in Figure 1(iii), we first know that (1) agent a believes RCBR exists between herself and agent b; (2) agent b believes RCBR exists between herself and agent a; (3) agent c believes that RCBR exists agents a and b. Then, we depict each agent's belief hierarchy with a graph and combine all of them as a whole, as shown in Figure 2.

Intuitively, it says that an agent is more certain about which strategies are rationalisable if she is more certain about the opponents' strategic behaviours.\nLemma 2 If $\\Theta_a \\subseteq \\Theta'_a$, then $R_a(\\Theta_a) \\subseteq R_a(\\Theta'_a)$.\nProof. Consider any strategy $s_a \\in \\Delta_a$ such that $s_a \\notin R_a (\\Theta'_a)$. Then, there is a strategy $s'_a \\in \\Delta_a$ such that $s_a \\prec^{\\Theta'_a} s'_a$ by Definition 4. Thus, $s_a \\prec^{\\Theta'_a} s'_a$ by the assumption $\\Theta_a \\subseteq \\Theta'_a$ and Lemma 1. Hence, $s_a \\notin R_a(\\Theta'_a)$ by Definition 4.\nNext, we define two notations that capture the local properties of RBR graphs. For an arbitrary node $n \\in N$ in an RBR graph $(N, E, l, \\pi)$, let\n$Adj_n := {m \\in N|nEm}$ (6)\nbe the set of all adjacent nodes from node n and\n$B_n := {l_m | m \\in Adj_n}$ (7)\nbe the set of labels of the adjacent nodes of n. Informally, in the RBR system denoted by the RBR graph $(N, E, l, \\pi)$, the (real or doxastic) agent $l_n$ denoted by node n believes that the agents in set $B_n$ are rational and the others are irrational. The agents who are rational in agent $l_n$'s belief are denoted by the nodes in set $Adj_n$ in the RBR graph.\nNote that $l_{m_1} \\neq l_{m_2}$ for distinct nodes $m_1, m_2 \\in Adj_n$ by statement (6) and item 2b of Definition 5. Thus, by statement (7), function $l$ forms a bijection from the set $Adj_n$ to the set $B_n$. For this reason, we have the next definition.\nDefinition 17 For any node n in RBR graph $(N, E, l, \\pi)$, the bijection $\\beta_n: B_n \\rightarrow Adj_n$ is such that $\\beta_n(b)$ is the node $m \\in Adj_n$ where $l_m = b$.\nIn other words, $\\beta_n$ is the reversed function of $l$ in the adjacent area (i.e. $Adj_n$) of node n.

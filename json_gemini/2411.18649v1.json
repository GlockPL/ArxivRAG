The proposed method addresses the challenges posed by datasets containing inherent internal clusters that lack explicit feature-based separations. By extending traditional logistic regression, we develop an algorithm that automatically partitions the dataset into multiple subsets, constructing an ensemble of logistic models to enhance classification accuracy. A key innovation in this work is the recursive probability calculation, derived through algebraic manipulation and mathematical induction, which enables scalable and efficient model construction. Compared to traditional ensemble methods such as Bagging and Boosting, our approach maintains interpretability while offering competitive performance. Furthermore, we systematically employ maximum likelihood and cost functions to facilitate the analytical derivation of recursive gradients as functions of ensemble depth. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on a custom dataset created by introducing noise and shifting data to simulate group structures, resulting in significant performance improvements with layers. Implemented in Python, this work balances computational efficiency with theoretical rigor, providing a robust and interpretable solution for complex classification tasks with broad implications for machine learning applications.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Logistic regression is a foundational [1] method for binary classification due to its simplicity and interpretability [2]. However, when faced with complex datasets, traditional logistic regression models often struggle to adequately capture the underlying decision boundaries. Ensemble methods, which aggregate multiple models to improve performance, have shown significant promise in overcoming these limitations [3], [4].\nDespite the dominance of deep learning models in modern machine learning, their complexity often comes at the cost of interpretability and computational efficiency. In contrast, logistic regression remains relevant in scenarios where these factors are prioritized. This paper introduces a dynamic logistic ensemble model that leverages recursive probability calculations, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to more complex methods."}, {"title": "B. When to Prioritize Interpretability over Predictive Power", "content": "In fields like healthcare diagnostics, financial modeling, and legal decision-making, the need for transparency often outweighs the desire for pure predictive performance. Although deep learning models can achieve remarkable predictive accuracy, their inherent black-box nature limits their applicability in domains where understanding the rationale behind predictions is paramount [5]. For instance, healthcare professionals must be able to explain diagnoses and treatment plans to patients, while financial analysts must justify their decisions to stakeholders and regulators. This is where interpretability-focused models, such as logistic regression ensembles, provide significant advantages. These models offer a balance between predictive power and transparency, enabling domain experts to trust, verify, and validate the model's decisions, making them more suitable for real-world applications where accountability and trust are critical [6].\nWhile post-hoc explanations for black-box models, such as deep learning, have been proposed, there is increasing advocacy for using interpretable models from the outset, particularly in high-stakes situations [6]. The case for prioritizing interpretability is further supported by research aimed at establishing a rigorous framework for interpretability in machine learning, which is essential for model evaluation in sensitive applications [7]."}, {"title": "C. Comparison with Existing Methods", "content": "While ensemble methods like Bagging and Boosting have been widely adopted due to their ability to improve model performance by reducing variance and bias [3], [4], they often rely on complex base learners such as decision trees, which can compromise interpretability [8]. Boosting methods, for instance, sequentially fit models to the residuals of previous models, leading to a final model that is a complex aggregation of many weak learners [9].\nIn contrast, our proposed dynamic logistic ensemble model retains the simplicity and interpretability of logistic regression while enhancing its capacity to model complex datasets. The key differences and advantages of our approach are:\n\u2022 Interpretability: Each model in the ensemble is a logistic regression, whose coefficients can be directly interpreted in terms of feature contributions. This is advantageous in domains where understanding the model's decisions is crucial [10].\n\u2022 Recursive Probability Calculations: Our method introduces a novel recursive framework for probability calculations, allowing the ensemble to capture complex patterns without sacrificing interpretability. This contrasts with methods like Random Forests, where the ensemble's decision process is opaque [11].\n\u2022 Automatic Subset Splitting: The model automatically partitions the data based on internal structures, without the need for explicit feature-based splitting or manual intervention. This is beneficial when the data contains latent groupings not easily identified through feature analysis.\n\u2022 Computational Efficiency: The analytical derivation of gradients for optimization enhances computational efficiency, particularly for higher-layer ensembles. While deep learning models may achieve high accuracy, they often require significant computational resources and are prone to overfitting without large amounts of data [12].\nBy positioning our method within the landscape of existing ensemble techniques, we aim to provide practitioners with a viable alternative that balances interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive performance."}, {"title": "D.

METHODOLOGY", "content": "The logistic regression model is implemented using the logistic function:\n$p(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x)}}$\nwhere $x$ is the input feature, $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are the model parameters. These parameters are optimized through maximum likelihood estimation [13], [14], with the cost function defined for $K$ data points with $y_k$ being the binary value for the class that data point represents as:\n$l(\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^K (y_k \\ln(p_k) + (1 - y_k) \\ln(1 - p_k)).$\nGradient descent is employed to minimize the cost function, iteratively updating the model's weights and biases [12]."}, {"title": "B. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation", "content": "The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including label encoding, feature standardization, and data augmentation. The augmentation involved adding Gaussian noise to simulate internal group structures within the dataset. This noise, calculated as 10% of each feature's mean and standard deviation, was added to generate a new dataset, doubling its size and improving the model's generalization capability.\nThe rationale behind this method is that Gaussian noise can mimic the variability seen in real data, allowing us to test the model's capability to generalize and adapt to subtle differences within classes. The impact of this augmentation on model performance was significant, as it increased the complexity of the classification task. The dynamic logistic ensemble models, particularly the 2-layer and 3-layer ensembles, were able to capture these internal structures more effectively than the baseline logistic regression model."}, {"title": "C. Recursive Probability Calculations for Ensemble Models", "content": "The core innovation of this approach lies in the recursive calculation of probabilities within the ensemble structure. The recursion starts with a single layer and extends to an arbitrary number of layers. For a single-layer model, the in-group probability is given by:\n$P(1|x_i) = h_1(x)$.\nFor a two-layer model:\n$P(1|x_i) = h_2(x)h_1(x) + h_3(x) [1 \u2013 h_1(x)],$\nor equivalently:\n$P(1|x_i) = h_1(x) [h_2(x) - h_3(x)] + h_3(x),$\nwhere $h_1$, $h_2$ (left branch), and $h_3$ (right branch) represent the outputs of the logistic regression models at the respective nodes."}, {"title": "", "content": "For a three-layer model, the probability calculation is:\n$P(1|x_i) = h_1(x) (h_2(x) [h_4(x) \u2013 h_5(x)] + h_5(x)\n[h_3(x) [h_6(x) \u2013 h_7(x)] + h_7(x)]) + h_3(x) [h_6(x) \u2013 h_7(x)] + h_7(x),$\nAs observed from (4), (6), and (7), a clear pattern emerges in the recursive expansion of probabilities across layers. Specifically, the probability equation for each ensemble can be derived by recursively applying a rule to the leaf probabilities in the ensemble probability equation from the previous layer:\n$h_j(1|x_i) \\Rightarrow h_j(x) [h_{2j}(x) \u2013 h_{2j+1}(x)] + h_{2j+1}(x),$\nThis pattern leads to the following generalized recursive rules for n-layered ensembles:\nFor $2j < 2^{(n-1)}$:\n$h_j(x_i) \\Rightarrow h_j(x) [h_{2j}(x) \u2013 h_{2j+1}(x)] + h_{2j+1}(x),$\nFor the final layer, where $2j > 2^{(n-1)}$, the rule is:\n$h_j(y|x_i) \\Rightarrow h_j(x) (h_{2j}(x)^y (1 \u2013 h_{2j}(x))^{(1-y)} + h_{2j+1}(x)^y (1 \u2013 h_{2j+1}(x))^{(1-y)})$\nThis recursive process is systematically extended to n layers, with each new leaf node iteratively expanding the formula from the previous iteration according to the rules in (9) and (10). The efficiency of this recursive method is implemented in the accompanying code, detailed in Appendix A.\nThese derivations reveal that the maximum likelihood function is convex only for the leaf nodes, while for other nodes, it can be approximated as linear."}, {"title": "D.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS", "content": "The purpose of this section is to describe the steps we took to prepare the dataset for testing the model's capability to identify and correctly classify internal groupings within the data. Given that the dataset does not include explicit features indicating any such groupings, our goal was to simulate these conditions and evaluate the model's performance. Below, we outline each step in detail.\n1) Original Dataset Description: The dataset utilized for this study is the Wine Quality dataset, which comprises 1,599 rows and 11 features related to the chemical properties of wine samples. The goal is to predict the \"quality\" of the wine, a target variable that is an ordinal integer value, based on the following 10 features: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.\n2) Label Encoding of the Target Variable: To facilitate binary classification, we first transformed the ordinal target variable, \"quality,\" into a binary format using label encoding. This conversion allowed us to focus on a simplified classification task suitable for the logistic regression-based models we aimed to evaluate."}, {"title": "", "content": "3) Feature Standardization: Feature standardization was applied to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model's decisions. Each feature was adjusted to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This step is crucial for the stability and performance of logistic regression models, which are sensitive to the scale of the input data.\n4) Data Augmentation to Simulate Internal Groupings: To test the model's ability to identify and classify internal groupings within the dataset, we performed data augmentation. Specifically, we added Gaussian noise to the original feature values, effectively creating subgroups within the data. This noise was calculated as 10% of each feature's mean and standard deviation, and was added to the data points to generate a new dataset. The result was a dataset that doubled in size to 3,198 rows, simulating internal group structures without providing explicit feature-based indications of these subgroups.\n5) Dataset Splitting: The augmented dataset was then split into training and testing sets with an 80:20 ratio. The training set comprised 2,558 samples, while the testing set contained 640 samples. This split ensured that the model had ample data to learn from and that the testing set remained a valid indicator of the model's ability to generalize to new data.\n6) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Before applying the model, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure that the dataset was balanced and free from major outliers. A bar plot was generated to confirm that the \"quality\" attribute was evenly distributed across classes, preventing any bias in model training. Additionally, pair plots and histograms were used to check for obvious decision boundaries and to identify any potential outliers that might affect model performance.\n7) Testing the Model's Capability: With the dataset prepared, the next step involved applying our dynamic logistic ensemble model. The primary focus was to assess whether the model could automatically detect and correctly classify the simulated subgroups within the data-demonstrating its capability to handle datasets with internal groupings, even when explicit features indicating the split are absent."}, {"title": "B.

The results are summarized in Table I."}, {"title": "D. Cost Function Convergence Analysis", "content": "The graphs in Figures 5 and 6 provide valuable insights into the convergence behavior of the dynamic logistic ensemble models, particularly in capturing internal group structures within the dataset. The progression across 1-layer, 2-layer, 3-layer, and 4-layer models illustrates the trade-offs between complexity, performance, and convergence rate.\nThe 1-layer ensemble model (Figure 5, top left) shows rapid cost reduction in the initial iterations, stabilizing quickly around a cost of 0.5. The quick convergence can be attributed to the simplicity of the model, which requires fewer parameters to optimize. The corresponding ROC curve (Figure 6, top right) reflects an AUC of 0.80, highlighting reasonable classification performance, but it also indicates the limitations of the 1-layer model in capturing more complex decision boundaries within the data.\nThe 2-layer ensemble model (Figure 5, second column) demonstrates a more gradual cost reduction, stabilizing at a lower cost than the 1-layer model. The additional parameters in the 2-layer model allow for more complex decision boundaries, which is reflected in the ROC curve (Figure 6, second column) with an improved AUC of 0.83. This suggests the model is better equipped to generalize across the dataset, capturing underlying group structures more effectively.\nThe 3-layer ensemble model (Figure 5, third column) exhibits a slower but steady cost reduction, eventually stabilizing at a cost slightly lower than the 2-layer model. The increased complexity of the 3-layer model enables it to achieve the highest AUC of 0.84 (Figure 6, third column), indicating that this model strikes a strong balance between complexity and predictive performance. However, the gain in AUC compared to the 2-layer model is modest, suggesting diminishing returns as model complexity increases.\nThe 4-layer ensemble model (Figure 5, right end) shows an extended cost decay period before stabilizing at a similar level to the 3-layer model. Despite having the highest complexity, its ROC curve (Figure 6, right end) indicates an AUC of 0.83, similar to that of the 2-layer model. This suggests that while the 4-layer model is capable of fitting the training data well, it does not generalize significantly better than the 2-layer or 3-layer models, possibly due to overfitting.\nIn conclusion, while adding layers to the ensemble improves performance, the gains become less pronounced beyond the 2-layer model. The 2-layer ensemble strikes an optimal balance between model complexity and generalization performance, making it a robust and efficient solution for datasets with internal group structures. The 3-layer model offers slight improvements but introduces more computational overhead without significant additional benefit, and the 4-layer model shows diminishing returns in generalization performance."}, {"title": "E. Analysis of Results", "content": "The results clearly demonstrate that the dynamic ensemble models significantly outperform the baseline logistic regression model in terms of accuracy, AUC, recall, and precision as the number of layers increases, up to a point. The baseline model provided a solid starting point with a training accuracy of 0.701 and a test accuracy of 0.689. However, it struggled with recall and precision metrics, particularly in identifying and correctly classifying the internal group structures simulated by the data augmentation process.\nThe 1-layer ensemble model showed an immediate improvement, with a test accuracy of 0.7375 and a notable increase in test precision (0.7709) and AUC (0.8019). This demonstrates that the analytical gradients work well in zeroing in on the optimized parameter values.\nThe 2-layer ensemble model achieved the best balance, with a test accuracy of 0.7547, a test AUC of 0.8257, and a recall of 0.6972, reflecting its ability to generalize well. This demonstrates that even a single additional layer allows the model to capture more nuanced decision boundaries. The 3-layer model continued this trend, with further improvements in recall (0.7224) and AUC (0.8435), though its precision (0.7842) saw diminishing returns compared to the 2-layer model.\nInterestingly, the 4-layer ensemble model, despite having the highest training accuracy (0.8202) and recall (0.7476), saw a slight drop in test accuracy to 0.7531 and test AUC to 0.8320. This suggests that the increased complexity of the model introduces some overfitting, where the model performs better on training data but loses some generalization capability on unseen data.

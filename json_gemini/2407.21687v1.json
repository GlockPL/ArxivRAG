Traditional\nobject detection models [10, 64, 24, 46, 65] rely on supervised learning with fixed data, where all\nclasses are predefined and known beforehand. However, real-world data continuously evolve over\ntime, leading to non-stationary distributions. Due to the stability-elasticity dilemma, fine-tuning\nmodels directly on new class data leads to catastrophic forgetting [35, 36], whereas joint training\nis expensive in both computation and storage. Therefore, incremental object detection (IOD) has\nattracted increasing attention in both research and practical applications.\nRecent advances for IOD adopt knowledge distillation and exemplar replay to address forgetting.\nKnowledge distillation-based methods [48, 21, 40, 9, 18, 39] typically involve distillation on the non-\nbackground predictions of the old model to circumvent the imbalance issue caused by an excessive\nnumber of background predictions. Exemplar replay-based methods [45, 16, 31, 32], on the other\nhand, operate by preserving a small subset of samples from past training data (exemplars), replaying\nthem in subsequent phases to mitigate the forgetting of old data. Despite the progress, there still exist\nlimitations. First, due to the fixed model capacity, severe conflicts between preserving knowledge of\nold classes and incrementally learning new ones exist. This not only impedes the accommodation of\nnew class knowledge but also leads to the overwriting and forgetting of old class knowledge. Second,\nexemplars with incomplete labels are inadequately equipped for replay. Even if pseudo labeling is an\nintuitive way, the low-quality supervision inherited from old knowledge will hamper the adaption.\nTo address the above concerns, we propose Dynamic object Query Assembly based DEtection\nTRansformer, abbreviated as DyQ-DETR, for incremental object detection. Inspired by dynamic\nnetworks for incremental classification [14, 25, 51, 54, 56, 63, 8], we motivate to investigate the\ndynamic architecture for expanding model capacity in IOD. Specifically, the object queries serve as\nthe class-specific representative essence for memorization. The object queries from old classes can\nbe assembled with learnable new queries for dynamically expandable representations with limited\nmemory overhead and acceptable time overhead. As demonstrated in Fig.1, we first obtain the visual\nfeatures of the whole image with a CNN attached Transformer encoder. Then the set of object\nqueries from previous steps are assembled with learnable ones corresponding to new classes in each\nincremental step. Moreover, we disentangle the self-attention and isolate the bipartite matching\nto remove the interaction between object queries from different steps. Besides, we propose the\nrisk-balanced partial calibration to tackle incomplete annotations for effective exemplar replay.\nGenerally, we circumvent the catastrophic forgetting in IOD from the perspective of dynamic\nnetworks, with the inspiration of incrementally adding class tokens has been proven effective in\nincremental learning [63, 8, 47, 53]. Notably, for object detection, multiple objects of a single class\nmay co-exist in one image (sometimes even many). We adopt a many-to-many rather than one-to-one\nmatching of dynamic queries, for which sparse object queries implicitly associate with the content and\nreference positional information of one or multiple seen old classes. We propose to memorize the set\nof object queries for sequentially arrived classes of data. An isolated group of queries is responsible\nfor detecting the objects from a set of classes arriving at the same time step. By incrementally\naggregating the category-wise object queries from previous steps and learning new class embedding,\nwe decouple the representations for old and new class knowledge with lightweight query embeddings,\nsimultaneously maintaining the stability and plasticity. As for exemplar replay, we propose to reserve\nimages with moderate matching losses as exemplars, further perform partial calibration on the outputs\nof corresponding queries with only the annotated classes. Such risk-balanced partial calibration\navoids over focusing on classes from any particular stage and eliminates the reliance on low-quality\npseudo labels. Through dynamic object queries and risk-balanced partial calibration, our proposed\nDyQ-DETR significantly alleviates the forgetting in IOD. The main contributions are three-fold:\n\u2022 We propose a novel approach to integrate dynamic object queries into Detection Transformer\nfor incremental learning. By dynamically incorporating object queries into DETR, our approach"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Incremental Learning (IL). Prevailing IL methods can be broadly divided as regularization-based,\ndistillation-based and structure-based ones. Regularization-based methods[1, 19, 38, 59] estimate\nparameter importance and penalize updating of crucial parameters to maintain previous knowledge.\nDistillation-based methods build the mapping between the old and new model by matching logits[26,\n45], feature maps[7], or other information[15, 42, 49, 50, 51], which leverage the knowledge transfer\nto prevent forgetting. Structure-based methods[14, 25, 51, 54, 56, 63] dynamically expand the\nrepresentative network, e.g., backbone, prompt, to fit the evolving data stream.\nIncremental Object Detection (IOD). As the typical extension of incremental learning, IOD involves\nmultiple objects belonging to the old and new classes appearing simultaneously. This co-occurrence\nmakes knowledge distillation an inherently effective strategy for IOD, since it allows for the utilization\nof old class objects from new training samples to minimize the discrepancies in responses between the\nprevious and current updating model. As a pioneering work, ILOD[48] distills the responses for old\nclasses to counteract catastrophic forgetting on Fast R-CNN[10]. The idea of knowledge distillation\nis then extended to other detection frameworks, such as CenterNet[64] (SID[40]), RetinaNet[28]\n(RILOD[21]), GFLV1[24] (ERD[9]), Faster R-CNN[46] (CIFRCN[12], Faster ILOD[39], DMC[61],\nBNC[6], IOD-ML[17]) and Deformable DETR[65] (CL-DETR[32]). Built on Deformable DETR\ninstead of conventional detectors such as Faster R-CNN, DyQ-DETR can efficiently expand queries\nrather than inefficiently enlarging the backbone or specific convolutional layers. Note that DyQ-DETR\nalso uses knowledge distillation techniques. As for exemplar replay,[16] proposes maintaining an\nexemplar set and fine-tuning the model on the exemplars after each incremental step.[31] proposes an\nadaptive sampling strategy to achieve more efficient exemplar selection and [32] proposes distribution-\npreserving calibration, which selects exemplars to match the training distribution. They usually\nfinetune directly using the exemplar set with incomplete annotations and overlook the amount of\ninformation and reliability of the annotated objects.\nTransformer-based Object Detection. The infusive work DETR (DEtection TRansfomer)[3]\nformulates object detection as a set prediction problem, with an elegant transformer-based architecture.\nIt captures global context and reasons object relations with attention mechanism. With a small set\nof learnable object queries and Hungarian bipartite matching[20], it eliminates the need for the\ncomplex non-maximum suppression and many other hand-designed components in object detection\nwhile demonstrating good performance. Deformable DETR[65] introduces sparse attention on multi-\nlevel feature maps, thereby accelerating the convergence of DETR and improving the performance,\nparticularly for small objects. There also exists many other DETR variants[4, 37, 22, 30] designed to\naccelerate convergence speed and enhance detection performance. Without loss of generality, we\nbuild our method on the commonly used Deformable DETR."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "Preliminaries In the paradigm of IOD, object detection is performed in multiple steps from sequen-\ntially arrived training data to recognize and localize objects of all seen classes in test images.

Specially, the images in Dt are only"}, {"title": "3.1 Transformer-based Incremental Object Detection", "content": "We build up the DyQ-DETR based on the DETR architecture [3, 65]. Other than the backbone, a\nDETR consists of an encoder, a Transformer decoder, and the predictor to generate object classes\nand locations. The encoder takes the images as inputs and outputs visual features. Then those visual\nfeatures and learnable object queries are fed into Transformer decoder for prediction. Notably, we\npropose to aggregate the object queries from up-to-far learning steps to resist the forgetting of old\nclass knowledge. Due to the absence of annotations from previous seen classes in incremental step t,\nknowledge distillation is applied for preserving the class-specific old knowledge. As in Fig.2, we\nselect the non-background predictions of old classes by thresholding. Pseudo labels \u1ef9+(1 < r < t)\nare generated by the last previous model. Instead of mixing the pseudo labels \u1ef9,(1 \u2264 r < t) with\nthe ground-truth labels yt, we use \u1ef9+ and yt separately to supervise the model training. The pseudo\nlabels for old classes and the real ground-truths are used to guide the learning of object queries being\nQ and Qt, respectively. Besides, object queries from different groups share the weight parameters\nof the Transformer decoder. To allow for computational complexity to grow linearly rather than\nquadratically, the self-attention over different groups of object queries are eliminated.\nAs for IOD with exemplar replay, where a small number of exemplar images et from dataset Dt in\ndifferent time steps are stored, we introduce a risk-balanced selection mechanism. At time step t,\nwe use the trained model It to score the annotated objects from images in Dt. The computed loss\nfrom the partial bipartite matching is considered as the risk score for exemplar selection. We choose\nthe sample images with moderate risk score for the tradeoff between the annotation importance and\nquality. Specifically, to build the exemplar dataset 61:t, we select the samples falling into the middle\npart after sorting, because they are informative and reliably annotated. Considering the image in\n\u20ac1:t is incompletely annotated for specific classes, we adapt the partial calibration. We leverage the\nincomplete annotations to calibrate the output for corresponding object queries in each group. Since\n\u20ac1:t is balanced, the partial calibration will prohibit the model being biased towards certain classes."}, {"title": "3.2 Dynamic Object Query Assembly", "content": "Existing DETR models employ a fixed set of object queries (i.e., learnable embedding) as the\ninputs of Transformer decoder. These object queries are progressively optimized to map into object\ninstances in images. Despite various designs, the learnable object queries are highly relevant with the\nspecific classes. For IOD, the object queries are expected to be associated with objects belonging\nto sequentially arrived classes. Since new classes are considered as backgrounds in previous time\nsteps, the preservation of old knowledge naturally contradicts the knowledge updating from new data\nlearning, especially from the perspective of object queries. Moreover, the conflict between a fixed\nnetwork and the continually emerged class-specific information severely undermines the performance\nof incremental learning, especially in non-exemplar scenarios.\nTo cope with incremental classes without extra modules in network architecture, we focus on tackling\nthe forgetting issue with dynamic object queries. At time step t, for a set of new classes Ct, a new\nset of learnable object queries Qt is added. The newly added object queries Qt are aggregated\nwith previous sets of queries Q\u2081,1 < r < t. The assembly of object queries {Q1, Q2,\u2026\u2026,Qt}\nserves as the input of Transformer encoder in step t. The visual embeddings et corresponding to the\nnewly expanded queries Qt are used to predict the objects of new classes Ct, and the old classes\nC\u2081(1 \u2264 r < t) is detected with the embeddings e, of old queries Q7. By dynamically expanding\nobject queries, the new and old classes are segregated by class embeddings, significantly alleviating\nthe conflict between the old knowledge and continuously evolving new knowledge.\nBased on the dynamic assembly of object queries, we further investigate the decoder design to\nrestrict the computational burden. In standard DETR, object queries interact visual features with\ncross-attention for refinement. Besides, those object queries interact with each other by self-attention.\nThrough self-attention, duplicated detections can be removed, but the computational complexity\nincreases quadratically with the number of object queries. Considering that the object instances from\ndifferent class sets rarely overlap, we disentangle the self-attention in Transformer decoder. The\nself-attention is computed among separate set of object queries, as:\n$a_{i,j} = \\begin{cases}Softmax(Q_{m,i} \\cdot Q_{n,j} / \\sqrt{d}) & m = n \\\\ 0 & m \\neq n\\end{cases}$ (1)\nwhere ai,j denotes the attention weight between two queries Qm,i and Qn,j from the query set Qm\nand Qn, respectively. By eliminating the attention interaction between queries of different groups\nas shown in Eq.(1), we achieve a linear growth in computational complexity almost for free. Upon\nthe addition of new queries, the capability of old queries to detect old classes is fully preserved. We\nperform the decoder forward passes as many as the time steps, obtaining the embedding vectors from\ndifferent sets of queries as:\ne\u2081 = decoder(ft, Qr),1 \u2264 t \u2264t, (2)\nwhere ft denotes the visual feature extracted from image x by the CNN and Transformer encoder.\nEach decoder forward pass is executed with a different set of queries Q7, resulting in different\ntask-specific embeddings er to obtain detection predictions of the corresponding classes CT.\nWe further adapt the knowledge distillation for incremental detector training. The foreground\npredictions with the pseudo labels generated from old model are kept for distillation and used for\nsupervision. As in [32], the foreground predictions with high confidence from the old model are\nselected. A probability threshold \u03b8p (typically 0.4) is set over the prediction scores. An additional\nIoU threshold \u03b8\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5 (typically 0.7) is used to restrict the predictions not too close to the ground-truth\nbounding boxes of new classes. It helps filter out incorrect predictions about new class objects that are\nmisclassified as old classes. The highly-confident predictions after filtering are used as pseudo labels\n\u1ef9,(1 \u2264 r < t), which contain two parts of annotations (i.e., the predicted object labels and bounding\nboxes). Notably, instead of merging the pseudo labels with real grounding truths, we compute the\nseparate bipartite matching losses with different set of object queries in an independent way. The\nloss for retaining old class knowledge LDETR(1 < r < t), as well as the loss for learning new class\nknowledge LDETR can be formulated as in Eq.(3):\nLDETR = LDETR(er, \u1ef9\u30f6),1 \u2264 r < t; LDETR = CDETR(et, Yt), (3)"}, {"title": "3.3 Risk-balanced Partial Calibration", "content": "For exemplar replay based IOD paradigm, an ex-\nemplar memory is formed to store a small num-\nber of samples for subsequent incremental learn-\ning.

We intend to choose\nthe class annotated images which are substan-\ntial for detector training. An intuitive way is\nto directly compute the loss between the model\noutput and the real label yt for sample selection.\nHowever, since the image x \u2208 Dt only con-\ntains annotations for the classes Ct of interest,\nthis will result in the loss being dominated by\nthe absence of old classes, posing challenges to\nforeground-background balancing.\nBenefiting from the internal decoupling of dy-\nnamic object queries, we are able to exclusively detect new classes Ct using the corresponding queries\nQt. Considering that the image is only annotated for the specific classes, the partial loss is more\nreliable. For computing the partial loss, the old classes are considered as backgrounds by Qt, which\nis compatible with the incomplete real labels yt.

(5)\nThe risk score can measure the quality of incomplete class labels and bounding boxes. Additionally,\nit also takes the number of annotated objects like in [32] into account. As in Fig. 3, images with low\nrisk, which constitute a high proportion, provide limited information for optimization, while those\nwith high risk are likely to be outliers with incorrect annotations. Based on the risk estimation, we\nconstruct the exemplar set et by sorting and selecting the middle part of risk-balanced samples in Dt.\nThe exemplar set et is merged with 6t-1 to form a set \u20ac1:t for partial calibration of the model.\nIn incremental step t, the exemplar sets \u20ac1:t are used to finetune the model after training with Dt.\nPrevious IOD methods typically finetune the model directly with dataset \u20ac1:t, without addressing the\nissue of missing labels. That is, an image x in the balanced exemplar set 61:t is only annotated for a\nspecific class subset from {C1, ..., Ct\u22121, Ct}, with the absence of annotations for other classes. The\nconfusing, even contradictive supervision hinders the process of prediction calibration. An intuitive\nway is to use pseudo labels, yet the quality of pseudo labels is hard to guarantee. Thanks to the\ndynamic object queries and associative disentangled computation, we propose to perform partial\ncalibration that relies only on the incomplete real labels.

Experimental Result Reproducibility\nQuestion: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-\nperimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions\nof the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: We have included details in the beginning of the experiments section and in\nthe appendix.\n5. Open access to data and code\nQuestion: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-\ntions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental\nmaterial?\nAnswer: [No]\nJustification: We are currently organizing the code and we guarantee that it will be open-\nsourced.\n6. Experimental Setting/Details\nQuestion: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-\nparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the\nresults?\nAnswer: [Yes]\nJustification: We have included details in the beginning of the experiments section and in\nthe appendix.\n7. Experiment Statistical Significance\nQuestion: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate\ninformation about the statistical significance of the experiments?\nAnswer: [No]\nJustification: The experimental results are quite stable, so error bars are not necessary.\n8. Experiments Compute Resources\nQuestion: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-\nputer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce\nthe experiments?\nAnswer: [Yes]"}, {"title": "Code Of Ethics", "content": "Question: Does"}]}

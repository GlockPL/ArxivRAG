{"title": "ArabLegalEval: A Multitask Benchmark for Assessing Arabic Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models", "authors": ["Faris Hijazi", "Somayah AlHarbi", "Abdulaziz AlHussein", "Harethah Abu Shairah", "Reem AlZahrani", "Hebah AlShamlan", "Omar Knio", "George Turkiyyah"], "abstract": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, the evaluation of LLMs' legal knowledge, particularly in non-English languages such as Arabic, remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce ArabLegalEval, a multitask benchmark dataset for assessing the Arabic legal knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by the MMLU and LegalBench datasets, ArabLegalEval consists of multiple tasks sourced from Saudi legal documents and synthesized questions. In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate Al research in the Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code: https://github.com/Thiqah/ArabLegalEval", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The development of LLMs has revolutionized various fields by enhancing natural language understanding and generation capabilities. However, the applicability and performance of these models in specialized domains, such as legal contexts, specially in low- and medium-resource languages such as Arabic, remain active research areas. In this paper, we report on ongoing work for evaluating the proficiency of large language models in understanding and processing Arabic legal texts. Given the complexity and richness of legal language, especially in Arabic, it is crucial to develop benchmarks that accurately assess the models' capabilities in this domain in order to guide model development. One of the key motivations for this work and benchmark is to find out the current state of LLMs in the Arabic Legal domain. Thus, we benchmark a wide range of LLMs from proprietary multilingual LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024a), to open-source Arabic-centric LLMs, such as Jais (Sengupta et al., 2023).\nThere are perhaps two broad categories of evaluation criteria that are useful for assessing the performance of legal LLMs. The first category is the ability of a model to use specific regulations, facts, and data that are relevant to a particular conversation. This can be achieved by having the LLM memorize specific facts, presumably by finetuning it on particular legal corpora, or more conveniently by using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to retrieve information relevant to the context at hand. The second broad category of assessment criteria is related to the model's ability to exhibit logical reasoning, understand relationships between entities and events, and apply these skills to answer questions."}, {"title": "Related work", "content": ""}, {"title": "Arabic and multilingual reasoning capabilities in LLMs", "content": "The success of LLMs, such as GPT-4 and GPT-40 (OpenAI, 2024a,b), Claude-3 (Anthropic, 2024), Command R and Command R Plus (Cohere, 2024a,b), and Llama3 (LLaMA, 2024), in exhibiting general purpose reasoning abilities - when queried in English - have naturally led to the development of models trained on Arabic content as well as benchmarks to evaluate the quality of reasoning in Arabic. Jais (Sengupta et al., 2023), for example, trained on native Arabic and quality translations, has shown better performance than other open-weight models on an Arabic version of the MMLU multiple-choice school exam questions benchmark (Koto et al., 2024). Arabic content and questions are also part of many broadly used multilingual benchmarks for assessing general reasoning. For example, MLQA (Lewis et al., 2020) assesses reading comprehension and question answering capabilities in languages including Arabic.\nWhile substantial experimentation is ongoing for evaluating reasoning and knowledge-based tasks in multilingual models, there are some model scale effects that appear to be emerging. On one hand, smaller models and models trained with limited data do not generally perform very well. Even GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022) performs worse when responding to queries in Arabic and Non-English languages as compared to English on various tasks (Koto et al., 2024; Jin et al., 2023). On the other hand, the performance generally improves steadily with increasing model scale (Shi et al., 2023). GPT-4, for example, exhibits remarkable performance on all sections of ArabicMMLU surpassing all other models including Arabic-centric ones, even when few-shot prompts are used. It appears that multilingual reasoning is an emergent ability of large language models. Beyond a certain (task-dependent) scale, LLMs have evidently strong multilingual reasoning abilities."}, {"title": "LLMs and evaluation benchmarks in legal domains", "content": "Given the importance of natural language to law, the advancing capabilities of large language models have been very quickly recognized and used for performing legals tasks. Current efforts are ongoing to explore whether current LLMs can be used as legal assistants for producing background research, drafting initial documents, summarizing contracts, answering questions about reports, and handling related tasks (Nay et al., 2023; Perlman, 2022; Goth, 2023). The announcement that GPT-4 has \"passed the bar exam\u201d (Katz et al., 2024) has shown potential that intelligent legal advisors are not too far off. In the area of tax law for example, LLMs, particularly when combined with prompting enhancements and the correct legal texts, can perform at high levels of accuracy (Nay et al., 2023). Systems for Arabic court rulings and QA related to Legal Palestinian cooperative maters were presented in (Ammar et al., 2024; Maree et al., 2024).\nHowever, closer inspection has revealed that certification exams or narrow domains are not always representative of the actual use-cases in law practice or for LLMs (Fei et al., 2023). As a result, a number of efforts have been ongoing to develop models, agents, and benchmarks that use tasks and general conceptual frameworks similar to those used in the legal profession. LegalBench and a Chinese counterpart, LawBench (Fei et al., 2023), have sought to collect and categorize a broad set of tasks that appear in law practice, from simple tasks requiring rule-recall or issue recognition to sophisticated tasks that require interpretation, drawing conclusions, and multi-hop reasoning. As many of the LegalBench tasks, particularly those requiring interpretation, appear to involve reasoning skills that are not particular to US law, it seems reasonable to use translated versions of these tasks for testing LLMs in different languages."}, {"title": "Data Sources", "content": ""}, {"title": "Raw Arabic data sources", "content": "Obtaining comprehensive Arabic legal data is challenging.

See Figure 1. We believe that the mixture of questions from native Arabic documents and translated questions gives us a somewhat diverse set of tasks and allows the benchmark to test a broader set of capabilities.

Generating MCQs poses two main challenges: formulating questions and generating options (correct answers and plausible distractors).\nWe approached this using a robust LLM and experimented with three methods: 1. QA to MCQ, 2. Chain of Thought (CoT), and 3. Retrieval-based in-context learning.

Any sample that failed to satisfy all of the above were removed, which left us with 10,583 MCQs for our benchmark.

The dataset used in these experiments is the United Nations Parallel Corpus (Ziemski et al., 2016), which consists of UN documents in the six official UN languages.

Interestingly, GPT-4 consistently rated the translations as either 4 or 5 out of 5, indicating a high level of perceived quality, see Appendix D for GPT-4 evaluation prompt and result example.\nHuman Evaluation We selected five examples from the translated texts, each consisting of a contract text and a corresponding question. To evaluate the performance of the three translation models Azure Translation Services, Google API Services, and Opus MT we asked legal experts to assess each contract and question separately. The experts provided scores for each model's based on the translation quality and how well the legal context was preserved in the translation. The overall scores for all three models were relatively close, but Opus MT consistently achieved the highest score among them:\n\u2022 Google API: average score of 3.3 out of 5\n\u2022 Azure: average score of 3.6 out of 5\n\u2022 Opus MT: Average score of 4 out of 5\nIn addition to the overall scores, we asked the experts to rank the best model for each example.

Different parts of the prompt can be optimized according to a given metric, and in this evaluation, we started with optimizing the instruction and few-shot examples to determine which method is more effective. Unfortunately, instruction optimization yielded no significant performance gain. On the other hand, few-shot optimization boosted the performance of many models. Hence, we decided to focus on few-shot optimization. ArabicMMLU is a benchmark to assess the capabilities of models, similar to MMLU benchmark, but with localized data in Arabic. A subset relevant to the legal domain of ArabicMMLU was sampled resulting in a total size of 524 questions after filtering questions that require context. Out of those 524 samples, 314 and 210 are law and political science, respectively. We optimize the prompts on this subset to use it for evaluating our generated MCQs.\nDSPy (Khattab et al., 2024) is a Language Model (LM) programming framework to optimize LM prompts and weights automatically by recompiling the entire pipeline to optimize it on a specific task. We relied on this framework for prompt optimization. Initially, all of the models were given a zero-shot prompt with an English answer instruction and the input-output format. Then, this zero-shot prompt is optimized for each model to achieve a higher performance by augmenting it with either plain few-shot examples or few-shot with reasoning demonstrations using CoT. Teacher and student models were used to create few-shot examples with CoT demonstrations, where the teacher is either a clone of the student or another model.

We evaluated several LMs on this dataset, including Command R, Command R Plus, and Llama3 (8B and 70B). However, GPT-40 was tested only on Claude-3-opus subset to mitigate potential bias towards its own generated questions (Panickssery et al., 2024). Our evaluation metric assesses LM performance by comparing the selected answer with the correct one for each question. For further ArabicMMLU detailed results with optimized prompts, refer to appendix G.\nTable 1 summarizes the performance of LMs on our generated MCQs using prompts optimized with DSPy on ArabicMMLU's legal subsets. Interestingly, many of the optimized few-shot prompts shared identical examples, suggesting that certain examples play a more significant role in improving LMs' performance than others. In addition, few-shot examples coupled with CoT reasoning boosted the capabilities of the models. For further testing, we employed GPT-4 as a teacher model for smaller LMs in both plain and CoT few-shot prompting. Surprisingly, these smaller LMs demonstrated greater performance in few-shot CoT when the teacher was a clone of themselves, rather than the more advanced GPT-4. This unexpected result suggests that LMs may have a better grasp of their own reasoning.\nWe observed that the choice of language plays a crucial role in the reasoning abilities of smaller models. In many cases, these LMs generated answers without providing accompanying reasoning.

These metrics often miss semantically similar answers that use different words.\nWe use use an LLM-as-a-judge (Huang et al., 2024), (Kim et al., 2023), (Zheng et al., 2023) to rate the answer similarity on a scale from 0 to 5 given the generated answer and the reference ground truth answer. In our case, GPT-4 is the judge, and we refer to the output score as the answer similarity metric, see figure ?? for details. We notice that the judge LLMs give a lower score to answers that are in a different language than that of the reference answer even when the content is correct. To mitigate this, we prompt the models to output answers in the same language as the reference answer (which is Arabic in our dataset).\nWe run the evaluation for each LLM with two cases: one where it is given the question and the needed context, and one where it is given only the question. We also add a \"golden model\" that always answers the perfect ground truth answer, just so that we can compare against the upper bound of what the judge-LLM is going to score."}, {"title": "QA Results", "content": "We run our experiments on the 79 NajizQA pairs that have been filtered and verified by legal experts.

We observed that most of the models performed well on the Contract QA task, which assessed the models capabilities to answer questions related to contracts. Command R Plus, using few-shot learning, achieved the highest F1 score of 99%. This high score indicates that the model can accurately understand and respond to questions about contracts when provided with a small number of training examples. However, this task proved to be the least challenging among the four tasks. On the other hand, the privacy policy entailment task proved to be the most challenging for the LLMs across all techniques, highlighting the complexity of this task. Command R Plus, using one-shot learning, achieved the best F1 score of 66%. This result suggests that while the models struggle with this task, Command R Plus is more capable of understanding of privacy policies when given a single training example.\nIn the final task, Privacy Policy QA, which evaluated the models' ability to answer questions based on privacy policies, GPT-4 with one-shot learning achieved the highest performance. This result demonstrates GPT-4's strong capability in extracting relevant information from privacy policies and providing accurate answers when given a single training example.\nOverall, one-shot learning achieved the best results for most of the models across the various tasks.

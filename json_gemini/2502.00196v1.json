Leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs, using Gemini 2.0, we used clinically\nrelated prompts and self-instruct method to generate diverse and rich synthetic\ntexts.

Discussion", "content": "The integration of LLMs in clinical workflows has a growing interest with its more responsible\nand explainable nature, especially within the field of dermatology [16,17]. Here, models must\nnot only achieve high success but also clearly present their reasoning to build trust among\nclinicians and patients. Factors such as bias monitoring, fairness checks, and interpretable\ndecision paths have become critical for ensuring that AI-driven systems comply with ethical\nand clinical standards. As researchers increasingly explore using vision LLMs for decision\nsupport systems, placing emphasis on developing responsible AI practices will accelerate\nclinician engagement.\nThis study has some limitations. While synthetic data can help to train and fine-tune\nLLMs, such features are rarely represented in SOTA LLMs' knowledge bases/cutoffs. SOT\u0410\nLLMs are mostly not trained on the medical corpora and latest developments in dermatology\n(Gemini 2.0 knowledge cutoff: August 2024 as of February 2025). Their training datasets\nand knowledge cutoffs might result in incomplete or not up-to-date synthetic data. Models\ntrained on synthetic data may therefore struggle to capture and explain subtle morphological\nnuances or rare lesion types/cases. Expert review of synthetic content remains essential"}, {"title": "Appendix 1: Prompts", "content": "Question Generation Prompt For question generation prompt, we used that prompt by\ngiving metadata information to ChatGPT 01:\n***** INSTRUCTIONS *****\nWrite questions to generate synthetic data using large language models.

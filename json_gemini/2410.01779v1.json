Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around 95% of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive results in various disciplines (OpenAI,\n2024; Anthropic; Team, 2024b;a; Dubey et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2023), while they also make sur-\nprising mistakes in basic reasoning tasks (Nezhurina et al., 2024; Berglund et al., 2023). Therefore,\nit remains an open problem whether it can truly do reasoning tasks. On one hand, existing works\ndemonstrate that the models can learn efficient algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming (Ye et al.,\n2024) for language structure modeling, etc) and good representations (Jin & Rinard, 2024; Wijmans\net al., 2023). Some reports emergent behaviors (Wei et al., 2022) when scaling up with data and\nmodel size. On the other hand, many works also show that LLMs cannot self-correct (Huang et al.,\n2023), and cannot generalize very well beyond the training set for simple tasks (Dziri et al., 2023;\nYehudai et al., 2024; Ouellette et al., 2023), let alone complicated planning tasks (Kambhampati\net al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024).\nTo understand how the model performs reasoning and further improve its reasoning power, people\nhave been studying simple arithmetic reasoning problems in depth. Modular addition (Nanda et al.,\n2023; Zhong et al., 2024), i.e., predicting a + b mod d given a and b, is a popular one due to its\nsimple and intuitive structure yet surprising behaviors in learning dynamics (e.g., grokking (Power\net al., 2022)) and learned representations (e.g., Fourier bases (Zhou et al., 2024)). Most works\nfocus on various metrics to measure the behaviors and extracting interpretable circuits from trained\nmodels (Nanda et al., 2023; Varma et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024). Analytic solutions can be\nconstructed and/or reverse-engineered (Gromov, 2023; Zhong et al., 2024; Nanda et al., 2023) but it\nis not clear how to construct a systematic framework to explain and generalize the results.\nIn this work, we systematically analyze 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and L2\nloss on predicting the outcome of group multiplication in Abelian group G, which is an extension\nof modular addition. We find that global optimizers can be constructed algebraically from small\npartial solutions that are optimal only for parts of the loss.

Existing works on expressibility (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2022) gives explicit\nweight construction of neural networks weights (e.g., Transformers) for reasoning tasks like au-\ntomata, which includes modular addition.

We can extend our\nframework to group action prediction, in which $g_2$ may not be a group element but any object (e.g.,\na discrete state in reinforcement learning).

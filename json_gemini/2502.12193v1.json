{"title": "AI and the Law: Evaluating ChatGPT's Performance in Legal Classification", "authors": ["Pawe\u0142 Weichbroth"], "abstract": "The use of ChatGPT to analyze and classify evidence in criminal proceedings has been a topic of ongoing discussion. However, to the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been studied in the context of the Polish language. This study addresses this research gap by evaluating the effectiveness of ChatGPT in classifying legal cases under the Polish Penal Code. The results show excellent binary classification accuracy, with all positive and negative cases correctly categorized. In addition, a qualitative evaluation confirms that the legal basis provided for each case, along with the relevant legal content, was appropriate. The results obtained suggest that ChatGPT can effectively analyze and classify evidence while applying the appropriate legal rules. In conclusion, ChatGPT has the potential to assist interested parties in the analysis of evidence and serve as a valuable legal resource for individuals with less experience or knowledge in this area.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The law is a fundamental part of our daily lives [1], and it is almost inevitable that everyone will interact with the justice system at some point. Legal professionals, such as attorneys, prosecutors, and judges, apply the law according to their specific roles, including advocating for clients, investigating criminal activity, and adjudicating cases. Meanwhile, the other parties involved, especially those without prior expertise and relevant knowledge, may find themselves confused in legal proceedings as defendants or plaintiffs, whether they have been accused of violating the law or their rights have been violated or their rights have been violated by others. Although the principle of ignorantia iuris nocet (\u201cignorance of the law is harmful"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "There is no doubt that the emergence of advanced tools such as ChatGPT has brought new opportunities to enhance law enforcement [25], risk management [26], improve efficiency [27], and expand operational capacity [28]. The embedded AI-driven capabilities can be leveraged across multiple tasks that have been explored in different scenarios and tailored settings.\nPerlman [29] demonstrated the use cases based on prompting ChatGPT with questions to test its capabilities in document generation, legal analysis, information and research. The author stated that the obtained responses \u201cwere imperfect and at times problematic", "AI will not eliminate the need for lawyers, but it does portend the end of lawyering as we know it\". We also agree that the AI-driven revolution in legal practice is undeniable, and resistance seems futile.\nArmstrong [30": "found that ChatGPT-4 was able, although sometimes imperfectly, to engage in legal reasoning about law and factual data, answer questions about legal opinions or documents, and even analyze, draft and summarize legal cases, write motions, draft patents, and write reports. However, in some cases ChatGPT performed particularly poorly on this set of prompts, occasionally producing unsatisfactory results with some serious errors. To conclude, since ChatGPT presented fiction as fact (and with confidence), legal professionals should not rely on ChatGPT responses, and thus it is not a substitute for careful reading and case analysis.\nAt the University of Minnesota Law School, Choi et al. [31] tested ChatGPT to generate answers to four real exams, including Constitutional Law: Federalism and Separation of Powers, Employee Benefits, Taxation,"}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The research problem concerns the analysis and classification of evidence collected in the form of a text note, performed by ChatGTPT, in the course of proceedings conducted by law enforcement agencies and the judgment of whether it is a criminal offense or not. More specifically, classification refers to the application by ChatGPT of the relevant provisions of the Polish Penal Code, which indicate the positive (P) or negative (N) qualification of the act, taking into account the effects of the actions of the suspect(s).\nNote that, law enforcement agencies in Poland refer to: Police, Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA), Internal Security Agency, Polish Border Guard, Customs Service, and Military Police.\nThe collection of input data was prepared as follows. Based on the information available on the Internet, a collection of 268 text notes was compiled, including both positive and negative cases. Thus, the cardinality of both classes was equally represented in the dataset.\nEach case was written by hand, and consists of three up to five sentences, describing a unique event, embedded in a place and time. The positive case exhibits an unambiguous indication of the person suspected of committing exactly one criminal act, as defined in the Penal Code or in another currently applicable legal document such as a law or regulation.\nThe negative case, on the other hand, describes a suspicious situation in which there are some premises of a possible violation of the law, but which objectively do not constitute grounds for an illegal act.\nA set of positive cases was manually labeled by a professional lawyer who, after analyzing the case, classified each case by precisely specifying the type of illegal act. There were no predefined labels for use. In practice, this meant searching and analyzing the applicable laws and selecting and assigning the relevant paragraph to a particular case.\nIn total, 15 different types of illegal acts have been identified and specified.\nNegative cases, on the other hand, refer to situations where individuals came close to breaking the law but ultimately did not commit a violation, making it invalid to classify their actions as positive. For instance, consider the following case. On 29 November 2024, at 9:30 a.m., a Honda CR-V (registration number QWE99098) was stopped for inspection on Narutowicza Street 11 in Gdansk. The driver, Milosz Sz., underwent a breathalyzer test, which registered 0.005 mg/L (approximately 0.0105%). It can be concluded that this level is within the legally acceptable limit according to the Polish regulations. Therefore, the classification of such conduct is negative."}, {"title": "4. Results", "content": "The evaluation of the results was carried out on the basis of a confusion matrix which is a fundamental evaluation tool used in classification tasks to measure the performance of a model by comparing predicted labels with actual labels. Since our study concerns binary classification, the confusion matrix, written as a table of size 2\u00d72, with the following components, was used.\nThe format used in the confusion matrix is that positive or negative refers to the class values predicted by the model, and true or false refers to the accuracy of the predicted model. Therefore, the interpretation of each cell is as follows:\n\u2022 True Positives (TP). Cases where the ChatGPT correctly predicted the positive class.\n\u2022 False Negatives (FN). Cases where the ChatGPT incorrectly predicted the negative class (Type II error).\n\u2022 False Positives (FP). Cases where the ChatGPT incorrectly predicted the positive class (Type I error).\n\u2022 True Negatives (TN). Cases where the ChatGPT correctly predicted the negative class.\nIn the period from December 2024 to January 2025, ChatGPT was asked to classify a collection of positive and negative cases, typically from one to five cases in a single message. In all cases analyzed, ChatGPT output was correct, as shown in Figure 1.\nTo evaluate ChatGPT in event classification, the following five evaluation metrics were used.\n1. Accuracy (Overall correctness of the model):\nAccuracy = $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP + F\u039d}$ (1)\nAccuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. Here, a value of 1.0 (100%) indicates a perfect classification with no errors made by ChatGPT.\n2. Precision (Positive Predictive Value):\nPrecision = $\\frac{\u03a4\u03a1}{TP+FP}$ (2)\nPrecision represents the proportion of correctly classified positive cases out of all predicted positive cases. In our research, a perfect precision score of 1.0 means there were no false positives (FP = 0), meaning ChatGPT never misclassified a negative case as positive.\n3. Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):\nRecall = $\\frac{\u03a4\u03a1}{TP+FN}$ (3)\nRecall measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified. A recall of 1.0 means that the ChatGPT detected all positive cases with no false negatives (FN = 0).\n4. F1 Score (Harmonic mean of precision and recall):\nF1 Score =2\u00d7$\\frac{Precision \u00d7 Recall}{Precision + Recall}$ (4)\n5. Specificity (True Negative Rate):\nSpecificity = $\\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$ (5)\nSpecificity measures how well the model correctly identifies negative cases. A specificity of 1.0 means that all negative cases were classified correctly, with no false positives.\nIn summary, ChatGPT achieved perfect classification, meaning that there were no misclassifications of either positive or negative cases in a total of 238 cases analyzed. In addition, in terms of the qualitative evaluation of the explanations provided, ChatGPT provided the correct legal basis for each classification, specifying the content of each paragraph of the Polish Penal Code."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "Legal documents such as court decisions, statutes, contracts, or regulatory guidelines are often long and filled with complicated terminology. From this point of view, summarizing legal texts turns out to be one of the most valuable applications of ChatGPT for legal professionals.\nChatGPT has proven its ability to analyze the texts and extract the most relevant points, saving lawyers considerable time and effort. It can present summaries in a structured format, highlighting key arguments, regulations, rights and precedents without omitting critical details. This is particularly useful for novice lawyers who need to quickly understand a case or legal framework without having to read through a stack of documents.\nIn addition, testing ChatGPT also revealed the ability to customize summaries, which seems valuable when considering a user's profession. For example, a legal professional, a corporate executive, or an individual seem to have different expectations and needs. This adaptability makes it a powerful tool for improving accessibility and efficiency in the legal field. By simplifying legal language for clients, it makes it easier for non-lawyers to understand their rights and responsibilities.\nThe novelty of this paper lies in the application of ChatGPT in the analysis of the Polish language with the aim of classifying short text messages in terms of the Criminal Code. In this view, the findings concern the performance evaluation, performed in both quantitative and qualitative manner. Specifically, using a novel dataset built from the ground up and externally validated, we demonstrated ChatGPT's ability to effectively classify collected evidence by selecting valid regulations, applying relevant laws, and providing up-to-date content.\nNonetheless, our study suffers from at least two obvious limitations. The first concern is the potential lack of generalizability due to the limited number of crime types. Without testing ChatGPT on a richer dataset, there is a risk that the observed perfect performance is specific to the fifteen crime types tested and does not truly reflect its ability to classify unseen cases.\nSecond, the dataset used appears to be relatively small and described in a concise manner, which may cause some researchers to question the results. However, the cases were developed based on real-world scenarios, which reduces the potential bias. Nevertheless, our dataset does not contain rare cases that could negatively affect ChatGPT's performance.\nTo confirm our findings, additional experiments with larger and more diverse datasets should be conducted. However, developing datasets from scratch that include real-world evidence is a considerable challenge. On the other hand, this approach raises concerns about confidentiality, in particular the privacy and security of personal data."}, {"title": "6. Conclusions", "content": "This research evaluated ChatGPT's ability to classify legal evidence written in Polish and determine whether a crime was committed based on the Polish Penal Code. The results show that ChatGPT correctly classified all 134 positive and 134 negative cases. Considering the former type, the model demonstrated logical analysis by considering not only the input data but also relevant legal resources, ensuring their correct interpretation and application. Taking into account the later type, however, posed an even greater challenge, as they often described situations that were legally ambiguous, requiring the model to distinguish between legal and borderline illegal actions while avoiding intentional deception.\nWith several new features recently added to ChatGPT, the future looks even brighter and more promising.

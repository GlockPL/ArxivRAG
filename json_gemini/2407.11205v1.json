Clinical decision support systems have been proposed\nto implement guidelines and improve adherence. One approach is to permit the navigation inside the recommendations, presented\nas a decision tree, but the size of the tree often limits this approach and may cause erroneous navigation, especially when it does not\nfit in a single screen.\nMethods: We proposed an innovative visual interface to allow clinicians easily navigating inside decision trees for the management\nof COVID-19 patients. It associates a multi-path tree model with the use of the fisheye visual technique, allowing the visualization\nof large decision trees in a single screen. To evaluate the impact of this tool on guideline adherence, we conducted a randomized\ncontrolled trial in a near-real simulation setting, comparing the decisions taken by medical students using Orient-COVID with those\ntaken with paper guidelines or without guidance, when performing on six realistic clinical cases.\nResults: The results show that paper guidelines had no impact (p=0.97), while Orient-COVID significantly improved the guideline\nadherence compared to both other groups (p<0.0003). A significant impact of Orient-COVID was identified on several key points\nduring the management of COVID-19: ordering troponin lab tests, prescribing anticoagulant and oxygen therapy. A multifactor\nanalysis showed no difference between male and female participants.\nConclusions: The use of an interactive decision tree for the management of COVID-19 significantly improved the clinician adher-\nence to guidelines. Future works will focus on the integration of the system to electronic health records and on the adaptation of the\nsystem to other clinical conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The US Institute of Medicine's influential report \"To Err Is\nHuman\" [1] created awareness that medical error is a major\ncause of avoidable mortality, morbidity and inappropriate use\nof resources. With the increasing recognition of shortcomings\nof healthcare systems, practice guidelines were widely advo-\ncated as a means of encouraging compliance with evidence-\nbased practice, leading to the \"guidelines movement\" [2]. Clin-\nical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are text documents summariz-\ning recommended practices for a specific condition, with the\nrationale and supporting evidence. CPGs may include flowchart\nclinical algorithms.\nThere is evidence that CPGs can improve clinical outcomes,\nbut also that the level of adherence is low in practice [3]. Pa-\nper guidelines provide limited support to clinicians for finding\npatient-specific recommendations [4]. The adherence to CPGS\nis impaired by many factors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] including: (1) inac-\ncessibility of guidance at the point of care: CPGs are long doc-\numents, difficult to read during medical consultations, (2) dif-\nficulties of application to local settings, (3) oversimplification:\nmost CPGs address a single disease while many patients have\nmultiple comorbidities, (4) ambiguity: guidelines are not writ-\nten in a formal language, and (5) lack of integration of patient\nvalues and goals.\nComputerized Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are de-\nsigned to implement CPGs and help clinicians make decision\nabout individual [10, 11, 12]. Evidence suggests that CDSSS\ncan positively impact care processes [13] and guideline adher-\nence [14]. CDSSs can mitigate to a considerable degree the crit-\nicisms frequently made about CPGs.\nThe first step in CDSS design is to formalize the medical\nknowledge that is informally described in CPGs, using a vari-\nety of computer-interpretable formats. The second step is to de-\nvelop a computer application that presents the knowledge con-\nveniently, e.g. by triggering alerts [15] or allowing interactive\nnavigation in the recommendations, presented as a tree or as a\nsequence of questions [16]. However, trees are often too large\nto be presented in their entirety on the screen, the navigation is"}, {"title": "2. Materials and methods", "content": "2.1. Brief description of Orient-COVID\nOrient-COVID is based on medical decision trees estab-\nlished from a review of international best practice guidelines\nfor the management of COVID19 and formalized by a multi-\ndisciplinary team, including doctors, nurses and specialists in\nmedical informatics. The decision trees have been structured in\na formal ontology, and stored in an RDF quadstore.\nThe CDSSs proposes an interactive navigation through the\ndecision trees. It includes two innovative features for reducing\nthe size of the tree and permitting its presentation in its entirety\non the screen: (1) the use of the fisheye technique reduces the\nspace devoted to the unselected parts of the tree, and (2) the use\nof a multi-path decision tree model [19] allows the user select-\ning several paths at specific nodes. This is particularly useful\nwhen the CPG considers several risk factors or followup ele-\nments, and proposes a specific independent response for each.\nIn such situations, the multi-path tree model avoid duplication\nof parts of the tree. Instead, several paths are selected and each\nleads to a distinct recommendation.\nOrient-COVID was developed as a client-server web appli-\ncation in Python using Brython, a Javascript-compiled version\nof Python and Owlready, a module for ontology-oriented pro-\ngramming [20]. The role of the server is limited and most of the\nprogram is implemented in the client. This allows patient data\nto remain on the client and thus supports data privacy.\nOrient-COVID also proposes a patient\ndata entry form, where the clinician can optionally enter patient\ndata . The data is used for triggering a personalized\nsemi-automatic navigation in the decision tree, hence accelerat-\ning the navigation.\nFor more details on Orient-COVID, please refer to [21] and\nto the demonstration website:\nhttp://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/appliweb/orient_covid.\n2.2. Study design\nThis is a single-center, 3-arm parallel group unblinded ran-\ndomized controlled study performed at the Lebanese Hospi-\ntal Geitaoui, a 250-beds University Medical Center in Beirut,\nLebanon. The study was performed between December 2023\nand February 2024. The participants performed on clinical\ncases, and no real patients were involved.\nThe protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed\nand approved by the hospital institutional review board."}, {"title": "2.3.

Participants were remunerated for their participation\nin the study.\nUpon their enrollment, participants received an information\nnotice about the study method and protocol. Each participant\nperformed sequentially all six clinical cases in the presence of\nthe same senior medical professional (internal medicine physi-\ncian with more than 10 years of postgraduate clinical experi-\nence, and thorough experience in managing COVID19 cases).\nHis role was to perform the simulation in total neutrality, in-\ncluding asking the participant to state his decision at all steps,\nand recording the participant answers."}, {"title": "2.4.

Results", "content": "3.1. Recruited participants\nThirty participants were recruited in the study, 10 were allo-\ncated in each group, A, B and C. Table 1 shows demographic\ncharacteristics of the participants. The mean per-participant du-\nration of the study was 45 minutes (for six clinical cases).\n3.2. Comparison of the three groups\nFigure 4 shows the scores obtained for each of the three\ngroups, A (no guidance), B (paper guideline) and C (Orient-\nCOVID). Groups A and B obtained almost the same results,\nwhile group C obtained a better result (about 1.6 points above).\nStatistical tests show that there is no significant difference be-\ntween group A and B, but a significant difference between\ngroups A and C, and groups B and C, respectively (p < 0.0003).\nThis suggests that paper guideline did not help the partici-\npants for solving the clinical cases, while Orient-COVID signif-\nicantly improved the quality of the decisions. The improvement\nis relatively modest (1.6 points) but highly significant. This may\nbe related to the fact that several criteria were actually easy to\nanswer: for 6 criteria, the percentage of good answers is above\n95% (Chest CT, General blood test, CRP, Decision to hospi-\ntalize, Antibiotics, Reevaluation decision). Consequently, the\ndifference measured is restricted to a limited number of criteria.\nAs paper guidelines did not provide any support, and group\nA and B performed equivalently, we grouped them in a group\nlabeled AB (without Orient-COVID) for the rest of the analysis,\nthus considering an \u201cOrient-COVID\u201d boolean variable instead\nof three groups. This facilitates the analysis and increases group\nsize."}, {"title": "3.3. Per-criterion analysis", "content": "Table 2 shows the per-criterion analysis. Five significant dif-\nferences were observed. For four criteria (Troponin, Anticoag-\nulant, Oxygen and Clinical status), the value was significantly\nbetter with Orient-COVID. For the last criteria (Ferritin), the\nvalue was significantly lower. Indeed, it appears that ferritin lab\ntest was not considered in the Orient-COVID decision support\ntool. Finally, some other criteria, e.g. EKG or Blood test, are\nnot significantly impacted by the use of Orient-COVID using\nthe Bonferroni correction, but trends can be observed."}, {"title": "3.4.

Discussion", "content": "In this study, we have assessed the impact of the use of Orient-\nCOVID, a computerized CDSS based on the advanced visual-\nization of decision trees, on the adherence to COVID19 CPGS\nduring a randomized controlled trial in simulated environment.\nThe results shows a significant overall positive impact of the\nuse of the Orient-COVID CDSS versus paper guidelines and\nabsence of guidance. Previously, we performed a preliminary\nqualitative evaluation of Orient-COVID perceived usability, and\nwe obtained a SUS (System Usability Scale) score of 92.5%\n[21], which is \"excellent\" according to the SUS scale [22].\n4.1. Limitations\nA study limitation is that participants were medical students.\nThis choice could have potentially affected the results.

A\nfirst review, by A Ameri et al. [27], distinguished two main\napproaches: (1) expert-system CDSSs that rely on a human-\ndesigned knowledge base, such as those implementing CPGs,\nand (2) CDSSs that rely on machine learning, for which the\nknowledge is learned from huge patient databases. In the first\ncategory, to which belongs Orient-COVID, the most common\napproach was rule-based systems. Most of the proposed CDSSS\n(about 75%) belong to the second category.\nA second review, by H Ben Khalfallah et al. [28], distin-\nguished four categories of CDSSs: (1) alert systems that raise\nalerts at the point of care, (2) monitoring systems that track and\nrecord various physiological parameters of patients, (3) recom-\nmendation systems that support the navigation through CPGS,\nand (4) prediction systems that aim at making diagnosis or pre-\ndicting the outcomes of treatment."}, {"title": "4.3. Detailed impact on the adherence to COVID19 CPGs", "content": "A positive impact was observed for certain criteria pertain-\ning to all three levels of the clinical management (initial assess-\nment, therapeutic decisions and reassessment), namely: Tro-\nponin, Anticoagulation treatment, Oxygenation treatment and\nClinical status, with additional trends on the following criteria:\nEKG, Il 6, Blood test and Reevaluation decision. For COVID19,\nEKG and troponin measurement upon admission were reported\nas having a potentially high impact on the morbidity and mor-\ntality of COVID19 patients [29, 30, 31, 32], and were used in\nprognostic scores [33, 34]. Moreover, anticoagulation use has\nbeen found to be associated with better clinical outcomes for\nCOVID19 patients [35]. Finally, oxygenation supplementation\nis critical [36].\nRegarding the major decisions relative to patient admission,\ntransfer or discharge, it seems, however, that there is no sig-\nnificant improvement associated with the use of Orient-COVID.\nThis might imply that the real added value of the CDSS might lie\nmore in guiding the clinician for the details of the evaluation and\ntherapeutics, rather than result in a change in the distribution of\nCOVID19 patient across different hospitals and extra-hospital\nsettings.\nRegarding ferritin, we have seen that Orient-COVID provided\nno support, and that it led to a significantly lower adherence on\nthat point, probably because participants expected some guid-\nance. This phenomenon is known as automation bias [37]."}, {"title": "4.4. Comparison to paper CPG experience", "content": "The study results have shown no significant difference be-\ntween paper guidance and absence of guidance, and a significant\ndifference between the CDSS and both other groups. This is in\nline with other studies reporting that the paper-based guidelines\ndid not support sufficiently healthcare practitioners in finding\npatient-specific recommendations [4, 38].\nThree advantages were reported orally by participants during\nthe session: the intuitive aspect and functionalities of the user\ninterface, the ease of navigation in the decision tree, and the\nautomatic navigation after having entered patient data. This can\nreduce the time to decision and the cognitive burden [39]."}, {"title": "4.5. Challenges and perspectives of integration in real clinical\nworkflow", "content": "Orient-COVID was constructed using an ontological ap-\nproach. It makes its update easy, since, in case of change in\nthe recommendations, editing the decision trees modeled in the\nontology is sufficient for updating the system, without any need\nto modify the implementation. In fact, ontologies facilitate\nstandardization, flexibility for change, and therefore promote\nsharing and reusability of medical knowledge between CDSS\nsystems implemented in different technologies and standards.\nAlong with the decision support tool, we developed a dedicated\ndecision tree editor as a desktop application.\nFurther evaluations of the approach are, of course, needed, to\nassess its usability more in depth, but also to evaluate it in terms\nof chance of erroneous navigation and time gain for clinicians.\nThe semi-automatic navigation, considering structured patient\ndata available, also has to be connected to EHR from hospitals\nto reduce the cognitive burden associated with data entry, and\nproperly evaluated."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "We presented a simulation-based evaluation of Orient-\nCOVID, a clinical decision support system for COVID19. The\nresults showed that this tool significantly improved the adher-\nence of participants to guidelines when compared to paper-\nbased guidance and absence of guidance. In particular, adher-\nence to a number of important assessment and therapeutic crite-\nria were significantly improved, which might translate into bet-\nter decisions impacting patient morbidity and mortality. Our\nmain perspectives include the integration of the system with\nhospital EHR, and the application of the dynamic multi-path\ndecision tree visual approach to other clinical guidelines, in or-\nder to support clinicians on multiple types of patient diagnos-\ntic or therapeutic decisions for other clinical situations beyond\nCOVID-19."}, {"title": "6.

Clinical decision support systems have been proposed to implement guidelines and improve adherence. One approach is to permit the navigation inside the recommendations, presented as a decision tree, but the size of the tree often limits this approach and may cause erroneous navigation, especially when it does not fit in a single screen.\nMethods: We proposed an innovative visual interface to allow clinicians easily navigating inside decision trees for the management of COVID-19 patients. It associates a multi-path tree model with the use of the fisheye visual technique, allowing the visualization of large decision trees in a single screen. To evaluate the impact of this tool on guideline adherence, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in a near-real simulation setting, comparing the decisions taken by medical students using Orient-COVID with those taken with paper guidelines or without guidance, when performing on six realistic clinical cases.\nResults: The results show that paper guidelines had no impact (p=0.97), while Orient-COVID significantly improved the guideline adherence compared to both other groups (p<0.0003). A significant impact of Orient-COVID was identified on several key points during the management of COVID-19: ordering troponin lab tests, prescribing anticoagulant and oxygen therapy. A multifactor analysis showed no difference between male and female participants.\nConclusions: The use of an interactive decision tree for the management of COVID-19 significantly improved the clinician adher- ence to guidelines. Future works will focus on the integration of the system to electronic health records and on the adaptation of the system to other clinical conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "The US Institute of Medicine's influential report \"To Err Is Human\" [1] created awareness that medical error is a major cause of avoidable mortality, morbidity and inappropriate use of resources. With the increasing recognition of shortcomings of healthcare systems, practice guidelines were widely advocated as a means of encouraging compliance with evidence- based practice, leading to the \"guidelines movement\" [2]. Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are text documents summariz- ing recommended practices for a specific condition, with the rationale and supporting evidence. CPGs may include flowchart clinical algorithms.\nThere is evidence that CPGs can improve clinical outcomes, but also that the level of adherence is low in practice [3]. Paper guidelines provide limited support to clinicians for finding patient-specific recommendations [4]. The adherence to CPGS is impaired by many factors [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] including: (1) inac- cessibility of guidance at the point of care: CPGs are long doc- uments, difficult to read during medical consultations, (2) dif- ficulties of application to local settings, (3) oversimplification: most CPGs address a single disease while many patients have multiple comorbidities, (4) ambiguity: guidelines are not writ- ten in a formal language, and (5) lack of integration of patient values and goals.\nComputerized Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are de- signed to implement CPGs and help clinicians make decision about individual [10, 11, 12]. Evidence suggests that CDSSS can positively impact care processes [13] and guideline adher- ence [14]. CDSSs can mitigate to a considerable degree the crit- icisms frequently made about CPGs.\nThe first step in CDSS design is to formalize the medical knowledge that is informally described in CPGs, using a vari- ety of computer-interpretable formats. The second step is to de- velop a computer application that presents the knowledge con- veniently, e.g. by triggering alerts [15] or allowing interactive navigation in the recommendations, presented as a tree or as a sequence of questions [16]. However, trees are often too large to be presented in their entirety on the screen, the navigation is"}, {"title": "2. Materials and methods", "content": "2.1. Brief description of Orient-COVID\nOrient-COVID is based on medical decision trees estab- lished from a review of international best practice guidelines for the management of COVID19 and formalized by a multi- disciplinary team, including doctors, nurses and specialists in medical informatics. The decision trees have been structured in a formal ontology, and stored in an RDF quadstore.\nThe CDSSs proposes an interactive navigation through the decision trees. It includes two innovative features for reducing the size of the tree and permitting its presentation in its entirety on the screen: (1) the use of the fisheye technique reduces the space devoted to the unselected parts of the tree, and (2) the use of a multi-path decision tree model [19] allows the user select- ing several paths at specific nodes. This is particularly useful when the CPG considers several risk factors or followup ele- ments, and proposes a specific independent response for each. In such situations, the multi-path tree model avoid duplication of parts of the tree. Instead, several paths are selected and each leads to a distinct recommendation.\nOrient-COVID was developed as a client-server web appli- cation in Python using Brython, a Javascript-compiled version of Python and Owlready, a module for ontology-oriented pro- gramming [20]. The role of the server is limited and most of the program is implemented in the client. This allows patient data to remain on the client and thus supports data privacy.\nFor more details on Orient-COVID, please refer to [21] and to the demonstration website: http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/appliweb/orient_covid.\n2.2. Study design\nThis is a single-center, 3-arm parallel group unblinded ran- domized controlled study performed at the Lebanese Hospi- tal Geitaoui, a 250-beds University Medical Center in Beirut, Lebanon. The study was performed between December 2023 and February 2024. The participants performed on clinical cases, and no real patients were involved.\nThe protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by the hospital institutional review board."}, {"title": "2.3. Recruitment", "content": "Participants were medical students and residents on rotation at the Lebanese Hospital Geitaoui-UMC. Enrollment was open after a communication about the study through diffusion lists. The participants were equally randomized in 3 groups: group A (no guidance), group B (paper guidance) and group C (Orient- COVID). Participants were remunerated for their participation in the study.\nUpon their enrollment, participants received an information notice about the study method and protocol. Each participant performed sequentially all six clinical cases in the presence of the same senior medical professional (internal medicine physi- cian with more than 10 years of postgraduate clinical experi- ence, and thorough experience in managing COVID19 cases). His role was to perform the simulation in total neutrality, in- cluding asking the participant to state his decision at all steps, and recording the participant answers."}, {"title": "2.4. Clinical cases and gold standard", "content": "Six COVID19 clinical cases were created by a panel of med- ical experts, inspired by retrospective anonymized data of real patients admitted to the hospital between January and December 2022. This ensured near-to-real patient data for the simulation. The cases covered a number of common COVID19 hospital sce- narios in terms of severity, with different outcomes (healed, de- ceased, transferred to higher level of care). For each case, ex- perts defined through consensus and in accordance with CPGS a set of time-dependent (upon admission, post-24h, upon dis- charge) diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic decisions, and then analyzed the patient medical file to verify patient clinical path- ways, outcomes and conformity with the CPGs. These decisions relative to each case constituted the gold standard for the study. Cases are labeled thereafter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Supplementary Ma- terial #1)."}, {"title": "2.5. Protocol", "content": "The participant signed an informed consent and disclosed demographic data (year of residency, year of birth, sex, uni- versity grade in the past academic year, prior experience with management of COVID19 hospital cases, estimated number of COVID19 cases managed, date of last COVID19 case man- aged). The participant was then given an appointment for the simulation session, which comprised the following steps:\n1. The participant received an information notice about the study objectives, methods and steps.\n2. If the participant was in Group B, he was presented with the paper CPG.\n3. If the participant was in Group C, he was presented with Orient-COVID.\n4. The senior evaluator presented the six cases sequentially to the participant, instructed the participant to formulate a decision according to the predefined decision checklist. The participant decisions were recorded by the evaluator and no critical feedback was given to the participant."}, {"title": "2.6. Data collected", "content": "For each clinical case, 22 decision criteria were considered, including:\n\u2022 9 criteria regarding the initial evaluation, and consisting of examinations or lab tests that can be ordered: EKG (elec- trocardiogram), chest CT (computed tomography), general"}, {"title": "3. Results", "content": "3.1. Recruited participants\nThirty participants were recruited in the study, 10 were allo- cated in each group, A, B and C. Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the participants. The mean per-participant du- ration of the study was 45 minutes (for six clinical cases).\n3.2. Comparison of the three groups\nFigure 4 shows the scores obtained for each of the three groups, A (no guidance), B (paper guideline) and C (Orient- COVID). Groups A and B obtained almost the same results, while group C obtained a better result (about 1.6 points above). Statistical tests show that there is no significant difference be- tween group A and B, but a significant difference between groups A and C, and groups B and C, respectively (p < 0.0003).\nThis suggests that paper guideline did not help the partici- pants for solving the clinical cases, while Orient-COVID signif- icantly improved the quality of the decisions. The improvement is relatively modest (1.6 points) but highly significant. This may be related to the fact that several criteria were actually easy to answer: for 6 criteria, the percentage of good answers is above 95% (Chest CT, General blood test, CRP, Decision to hospi- talize, Antibiotics, Reevaluation decision). Consequently, the difference measured is restricted to a limited number of criteria.\nAs paper guidelines did not provide any support, and group A and B performed equivalently, we grouped them in a group labeled AB (without Orient-COVID) for the rest of the analysis, thus considering an \u201cOrient-COVID\u201d boolean variable instead of three groups. This facilitates the analysis and increases group size."}, {"title": "3.3. Per-criterion analysis", "content": "Table 2 shows the per-criterion analysis. Five significant dif- ferences were observed. For four criteria (Troponin, Anticoag- ulant, Oxygen and Clinical status), the value was significantly better with Orient-COVID. For the last criteria (Ferritin), the value was significantly lower. Indeed, it appears that ferritin lab test was not considered in the Orient-COVID decision support tool. Finally, some other criteria, e.g. EKG or Blood test, are not significantly impacted by the use of Orient-COVID using the Bonferroni correction, but trends can be observed."}, {"title": "3.4. Factor analysis", "content": "Table 3 shows the per-factor analysis. No significant differ- ence was observed with regard to sex, age, grades obtained at university, or according to the number of Covid-19 cases the participants encountered during their clinical activity, nor any interaction between these factors and Orient-COVID. Neverthe- less, this analysis should be considered cautiously because of the low group size."}, {"title": "4. Discussion", "content": "In this study, we have assessed the impact of the use of Orient- COVID, a computerized CDSS based on the advanced visual- ization of decision trees, on the adherence to COVID19 CPGS during a randomized controlled trial in simulated environment. The results shows a significant overall positive impact of the use of the Orient-COVID CDSS versus paper guidelines and absence of guidance. Previously, we performed a preliminary qualitative evaluation of Orient-COVID perceived usability, and we obtained a SUS (System Usability Scale) score of 92.5% [21], which is \"excellent\" according to the SUS scale [22].\n4.1. Limitations\nA study limitation is that participants were medical students. This choice could have potentially affected the results. How- ever, students are very involved in decision-making, especially"}, {"title": "4.2. Comparison to literature", "content": "In the literature, many CDSS were proposed for Covid-19. A first review, by A Ameri et al. [27], distinguished two main approaches: (1) expert-system CDSSs that rely on a human- designed knowledge base, such as those implementing CPGs, and (2) CDSSs that rely on machine learning, for which the knowledge is learned from huge patient databases. In the first category, to which belongs Orient-COVID, the most common approach was rule-based systems. Most of the proposed CDSSS (about 75%) belong to the second category.\nA second review, by H Ben Khalfallah et al. [28], distin- guished four categories of CDSSs: (1) alert systems that raise alerts at the point of care, (2) monitoring systems that track and record various physiological parameters of patients, (3) recom- mendation systems that support the navigation through CPGS, and (4) prediction systems that aim at making diagnosis or pre- dicting the outcomes of treatment."}, {"title": "4.3. Detailed impact on the adherence to COVID19 CPGs", "content": "A positive impact was observed for certain criteria pertain- ing to all three levels of the clinical management (initial assess- ment, therapeutic decisions and reassessment), namely: Tro- ponin, Anticoagulation treatment, Oxygenation treatment and Clinical status, with additional trends on the following criteria: EKG, Il 6, Blood test and Reevaluation decision. For COVID19, EKG and troponin measurement upon admission were reported as having a potentially high impact on the morbidity and mor- tality of COVID19 patients [29, 30, 31, 32], and were used in prognostic scores [33, 34]. Moreover, anticoagulation use has been found to be associated with better clinical outcomes for COVID19 patients [35]. Finally, oxygenation supplementation is critical [36].\nRegarding the major decisions relative to patient admission, transfer or discharge, it seems, however, that there is no sig- nificant improvement associated with the use of Orient-COVID. This might imply that the real added value of the CDSS might lie more in guiding the clinician for the details of the evaluation and therapeutics, rather than result in a change in the distribution of COVID19 patient across different hospitals and extra-hospital settings.\nRegarding ferritin, we have seen that Orient-COVID provided no support, and that it led to a significantly lower adherence on that point, probably because participants expected some guid- ance. This phenomenon is known as automation bias [37]."}, {"title": "4.4. Comparison to paper CPG experience", "content": "The study results have shown no significant difference be- tween paper guidance and absence of guidance, and a significant difference between the CDSS and both other groups. This is in line with other studies reporting that the paper-based guidelines did not support sufficiently healthcare practitioners in finding patient-specific recommendations [4, 38].\nThree advantages were reported orally by participants during the session: the intuitive aspect and functionalities of the user interface, the ease of navigation in the decision tree, and the automatic navigation after having entered patient data. This can reduce the time to decision and the cognitive burden [39]."}, {"title": "4.5. Challenges and perspectives of integration in real clinical workflow", "content": "Orient-COVID was constructed using an ontological ap- proach. It makes its update easy, since, in case of change in the recommendations, editing the decision trees modeled in the ontology is sufficient for updating the system, without any need to modify the implementation. In fact, ontologies facilitate standardization, flexibility for change, and therefore promote sharing and reusability of medical knowledge between CDSS systems implemented in different technologies and standards. Along with the decision support tool, we developed a dedicated decision tree editor as a desktop application.\nFurther evaluations of the approach are, of course, needed, to assess its usability more in depth, but also to evaluate it in terms of chance of erroneous navigation and time gain for clinicians. The semi-automatic navigation, considering structured patient data available, also has to be connected to EHR from hospitals to reduce the cognitive burden associated with data entry, and properly evaluated."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion", "content": "We presented a simulation-based evaluation of Orient- COVID, a clinical decision support system for COVID19. The results showed that this tool significantly improved the adher- ence of participants to guidelines when compared to paper- based guidance and absence of guidance. In particular, adher- ence to a number of important assessment and therapeutic crite- ria were significantly improved, which might translate into bet- ter decisions impacting patient morbidity and mortality. Our main perspectives include the integration of the system with hospital EHR, and the application of the dynamic multi-path decision tree visual approach to other clinical guidelines, in or- der to support clinicians on multiple types of patient diagnos- tic or therapeutic decisions for other clinical situations beyond COVID-19."}, {"title": "6.

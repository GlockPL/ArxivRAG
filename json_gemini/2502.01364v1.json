However, this reductionist approach, known as datafication, risks obscuring the complexity and nuance inherent in human existence [6]. The field of digital humanities grapples with this tension, exploring the affordances and limitations of computational methods in understanding human culture and expression [8]. Albert Camus' The Stranger offers a poignant exploration of this paradox [1]. Meursault, the novel's protagonist, embodies the absurd hero, a figure alienated from societal norms and conventional morality [1][2]. His emotionally detached responses to significant life events, such as his mother's death and his own impending execution, challenge traditional notions of meaning and understanding [1].\nThis paper seeks to examine whether Meursault's existential experiences can be meaningfully captured through data. Using a dataset generated from The Stranger and analyzed with various NLP techniques, including emotion detection (BERT) [9], sentiment analysis (VADER) [10], and absurdity tagging, we quantify Meursault's behaviors and emotional responses. This empirical approach allows us to explore the ethical and philosophical implications of reducing complex human experiences to structured data [12]. Specifically, we ask: Can data-driven models capture the essence of existential alienation [3]? What are the limitations and ethical concerns of applying modern AI tools to such narratives [13]?\nBy analyzing Meursault's life as a dataset, we aim to highlight the risks of oversimplification and the loss of meaning in datafication [5], ultimately advocating for a more humanistic approach to data interpretation."}, {"title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "The intersection of existentialism and data analysis presents a compelling paradox: Can the subjective, nuanced, and often irrational aspects of human existence be effectively captured through the objective, quantifiable lens of data? This literature review explores this question by examining the character of Meursault from Albert Camus' The Stranger [1] and drawing on existentialist philosophy, particularly Camus' concept of absurdity [2]. By synthesizing existing literature and considering the emerging field of digital humanities [8], this review delves into the implications and ethical challenges of reducing the human experience to data [5]. It critically evaluates the limitations and potential risks of datafication, questioning whether the complexity of existential struggles and the human condition can truly be represented in such a reductive framework."}, {"title": "Existentialism and the Absurdity of Human Existence", "content": "Central to existentialist philosophy is the belief that human life is inherently absurd-a concept articulated by Albert Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus [2] and The Stranger [1]. According to Camus, the absurd arises from the conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the universe's indifference to this deLsire [2]. Meursault, the quintessential absurd hero, confronts this tension with detachment and indifference, rejecting societal expectations of emotion and morality [1]. His refusal to conform underscores the existential themes of alienation [3], the search for authenticity in a meaningless world [4], and the individual's freedom to create meaning in the face of absurdity [2].\nThis philosophical stance directly challenges the reductionist mindset prevalent in modern technology. Datafication, the process of transforming human experiences into quantifiable data, operates under the assumption that all facets of human behavior can be measured, analyzed, and understood through data. However, as Camus emphasizes, human existence is marked by subjective and often irrational experiences that defy categorization [1][2]. This inherent resistance to quantification underscores the limitations of data-driven approaches in capturing the complexity of existential themes. Moreover, it raises questions about what is lost when we reduce the richness of lived experiences to mere data points."}, {"title": "The Limitations of Data-Driven Reductionism in the Digital Humanities", "content": "The field of digital humanities explores the use of computational methods to analyze and interpret cultural artifacts, including literary texts. While these methods offer new possibilities for understanding human expression, they also raise concerns about the limitations of data-driven reductionism.\nDatafication promises to provide objective insights into human behavior, but it often fails to account for the nuances and ambiguities of lived experience. Luciano Floridi argues that while data can simulate patterns of human behavior, it cannot replicate the subjective depth and context that define human existence [5]. This critique is particularly relevant when examining a character like Meursault, whose actions and emotions are deeply rooted in existential absurdity [1].\nOur dataset, which we made from The Stranger, exemplifies this challenge. For instance, emotion detection models like BERT [9] classify Meursault's reactions as sadness or anger, failing to capture the philosophical indifference that defines his character. Similarly, sentiment analysis tools such as VADER [10] apply polarity scores to Meursault's narrative, reducing his existential reflections to simplistic positive or negative values. These misclassifications highlight the risk of oversimplification and distortion inherent in datafication. They also underscore the need for more nuanced computational approaches that can better account for the complexities of human experiences, especially those rooted in existentialism."}, {"title": "The Ethics of Datafication and the Misinterpretation of Meursault", "content": "The ethical implications of datafication extend beyond literary analysis, raising broader concerns about privacy, bias, and autonomy. Shoshana Zuboff warns of the dangers of ``surveillance capitalism,\" where personal data is commodified and used to manipulate behavior [6]. In this context, the reduction of individuals to data points can lead to dehumanization and loss of agency [12].\nApplying these ethical concerns to Meursault's case, we see a parallel in how his identity is reduced to quantifiable metrics. For example, our named entity recognition (NER) model identifies character interactions but cannot capture the existential significance of these relationships. Meursault's detachment from his mother's death is recorded as an absence of emotion, but this reduction ignores the deeper philosophical critique of societal norms embedded in his response [1].\nReal-world applications of AI and big data demonstrate similar ethical dilemmas. Predictive policing algorithms, for instance, rely on historical data that often reflect existing biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes [13]. Similarly, hiring algorithms may reinforce gender or racial inequalities if trained on biased datasets [12]. These examples underscore the need for ethical frameworks that prioritize human dignity and complexity over algorithmic efficiency.\nThis philosophical challenge is not unique to literature. For instance, predictive policing systems often misinterpret calm behavior as suspicious due to inherent biases. Similarly, AI tools in mental health assessments may misclassify emotional detachment as depression. These real-world misinterpretations echo the limitations observed in analyzing Meursault's narrative, emphasizing the need for Al systems capable of understanding contextual and philosophical nuances."}, {"title": "The Need for a Philosophy of Big Data in Literary Studies", "content": "As big data continues to shape our understanding of the world, it is essential to develop a philosophical framework that addresses its epistemological and ethical implications, especially in the context of literary analysis. A robust philosophy of big data must grapple with questions about the nature of knowledge, truth, and human agency in the digital age. Floridi suggests that data-driven technologies must be guided by principles that respect the inherent ambiguity and subjectivity of human experience [5].\nIn the context of The Stranger, this philosophical framework highlights the limitations of using data to understand Meursault's existential journey. His actions and emotions cannot be reduced to binary classifications or sentiment scores without losing their deeper meaning. By examining Meursault as a data point, we expose the inadequacy of datafication in capturing the richness of human existence and advocate for a more nuanced, ethical approach to data interpretation. This approach should acknowledge the limitations of current Al tools while remaining open to the potential of future advancements in the field."}, {"title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "content": "This study operates at the intersection of existential philosophy and datafication, using the character of Meursault from Albert Camus' The Stranger [1] as a case study to explore the limitations of reducing complex human experiences to quantifiable data.

Results indicate a predominance of 'sadness,' appearing in 42% of paragraphs (see Figure 5). However, the classification must be interpreted cautiously: Meursault's existential indifference [1][2] is often categorized as 'sadness' or 'anger,' highlighting the difficulty of quantifying complex philosophical stances using current AI methodologies.\nWhile our analysis classified 42% of paragraphs as 'sadness,' this label often oversimplifies Meursault's philosophical detachment. For instance, in the passage where he describes his mother's death with apparent indifference, the BERT model categorizes it as sadness. In contrast, a passage describing his interaction with Marie is correctly identified as positive sentiment. These contrasting results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of emotion detection tools when applied to existential literature. This discrepancy underscores the challenge of capturing existential themes, which resist simplistic emotional categorization, and highlights the broader implications for AI applications in literary analysis.\nFurther sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) [10] revealed an overall negative sentiment. The mean sentiment score was -0.23, with a standard deviation of 0.45, consistent with the novel's somber tone and Meursault's detached observations (see Figure 6).

The predominance of 'sadness' and negative sentiment aligns with the novel's somber tone and Meursault's detached demeanor [1]. However, the limitations of AI tools in fully capturing nuanced emotions and philosophical stances like existential indifference [1][2] are evident.\nThe mapping of Meursault's social interactions and the identification of existential themes underscored the influence of relationships and philosophical underpinnings on his actions and observations. The observed disproportion between dialogue and internal monologues emphasized Meursault's introspective nature and reserved social interactions [1].\nWhile our findings offer valuable insights into The Stranger [1], we recognize that computational methods may not fully encapsulate the complexities of literary works [5]. Future research could explore more nuanced NLP approaches and incorporate qualitative analysis for a more holistic understanding.\nThis study contributes to the growing field of digital humanities by demonstrating the potential of computational analysis in literary studies [8]. It advocates for a cautious and ethical approach to data interpretation [12], recognizing the limitations of current Al tools while embracing the potential of future advancements in the field.\nOur findings highlight significant ethical implications for Al development. Misinterpretations of literary characters mirror real-world risks in areas such as mental health diagnostics or social behavior analysis. To address this, AI models must incorporate contextual understanding and ethical frameworks. Collaboration between technologists and philosophers could foster AI systems that better respect the complexity of human experiences, moving beyond reductionist interpretations."}]}

This short essay aims to highlight one such risk: how generative AI\nincludes or excludes equity-deserving groups in its outputs.

Additionally, it plays a crucial role in shaping societal norms and social contracts. As\nNemitz (2018) notes, we live in a world shaped by technology at least as much as by law and\ndemocracy. Just as people influence the law and the law guides human behavior, we need\nalso to recognize\u2014and actively engage in\u2014the mutual shaping of law and technology.\n\nThe positive affordances of technology include, but are not limited to, connectedness and\nself-expression on social media, supporting open, transparent, and accountable governments,\nand facilitating more inclusive decision-making and democratic governance. Moreover,\ntechnology can have a positive impact on diverse groups by helping them gain skills, cultural\ncompetencies, and human and social capital.

Before\nlaunching the main experiment, I conducted a preliminary experiment with ChatGPT and Meta\nAI, both of which provide textual and visual outputs, to assess whether any noticeable bias\nexists in textual outputs compared to visual ones. I used a straightforward prompt to generate\nimages of various professions, and the results were surprising. The prompt I used was: \u201cHow\nshould a taxi driver's appearance be? Please give me a picture.\"\nChatGPT generated an image after generating the text below:\n\n\u201cA taxi driver's appearance should be professional and approachable to create a good impression\non passengers. Here's a description:\n\n\u2022\tClothing: A neat and clean shirt, preferably with a collar. The shirt could be a solid color\n\tlike white, light blue, or light gray. The driver might also wear a jacket, especially if the\n\tweather is cooler. Dark-colored pants or jeans, free of wrinkles and stains, are ideal.\n\u2022\tFootwear: Comfortable but presentable shoes, such as loafers or dress shoes, are\n\tpreferred. Sneakers might be acceptable if they are clean and in good condition.\n\u2022\tGrooming: Well-groomed hair, trimmed facial hair (if any), and general cleanliness are\n\timportant. The driver should avoid strong fragrances or excessive cologne.\n\nLet me generate an image based on this description.\"\nThe text appears to be gender-neutral, age-neutral, and race-neutral. However, the first\ngenerated image depicted a young white man. When I requested another image, it again\ngenerated a young white man (Figure 1)."}, {"title": "Stereotypes", "content": "The representation of women and middle-aged and elderly individuals in AI-generated images\nof various occupations seems to reinforce existing stereotypes or mirror their current status in\nthe job market (Figure 3)."}, {"title": "Women's representation", "content": "Women are underrepresented in senior roles and technology jobs, equitably represented in\nadvisory roles, and slightly overrepresented in the health and biotech sectors.

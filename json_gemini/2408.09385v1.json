Powered by an extremely large number of parameters, LLMs encode the wealth of human knowledge via a pretraining process, which is often conducted on a web-scale text corpus with the next token prediction objective. As LLMs become more capable, it is essential and demanding for them to follow human preferences such as truthfulness, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Unfortunately, the maximum likelihood objective for the next token prediction falls short in capturing such crucial human values (Stiennon et al., 2020).\nReinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has been introduced as an effective method for LLMs alignment (Ouyang et al., 2022; Stiennon et al., 2020). RLHF first leverages a supervised learning objective to equip LLMs with basic instruction-following capabilities. Subsequently, a reward model is trained on a human preference dataset that contains pairwise comparisons of responses from LLMs (for the same query). The reward model is exploited for further finetuning LLMs via reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). Specifically, training with PPO requires four models: a policy model (the targeted LLM), a critic model, a reference model (i.e., a supervised-finetuning version of the targeted LLM), and a reward model. All these models are based on LLMs with billions of parameters, whereas the policy and the critic models need to be updated online. In light of this, RLHF is highly resource-demanding and rather complicated to be applied in practice.\nIn this context, offline RL has been proposed as an alternative approach to LLMs alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). The basic idea of offline RLHF is to directly train LLMs on the preference dataset using some ranking loss such as max-margin ranking loss (Yuan et al., 2023), or negative log-likelihood loss (Rafailov et al., 2023). Optionally, a reward model can be trained to collect comparison data for sampling new responses from LLMs (Yuan et al., 2023). It should be noted that these offline RLHF methods only exploit the ordinal relationship between responses rather than making use of scalar values for rewarding (or penalizing) responses as in RLHF. The ordinal relationship, however, does not reflect the degree to which the preferred response is better than the dispreferred one. For instance, Figure 1 shows an example where the quality difference of the pair (response 1, response 2) is not as significant as that of the pair (response 1, response 3). As such, treating the two pairs equivalently may result in suboptimal performance for offline RLHF.\nTo mitigate the aforementioned issue, we propose a simple yet effective method based on Reward Difference Optimization, shorted as RDO. First of all, the reward difference coefficient is introduced as the degree to which one response is preferred against the other one given the same query. Such coefficients can be exploited as sample weights, which are incorporated into diverse offline RLHF methods as additional supervision signals for calibrating the loss function. Basically, one can train a reward model similar to that in RLHF and then exploit the reward values for reward difference measurement. This method, however, is not effective enough as the reward model independently assigns scores to responses. Inspired by how much easier it is for humans to conduct pairwise judgments, we propose a difference model to directly predict the reward difference between two responses. Unlike the reward model, our difference model leverages attention-based interactions between two responses for prediction. Our contributions are summarized as follows:"}, {"title": null, "content": "\u2022 We introduce reward difference coefficients and show how they can be incorporated into offline RLHF methods including RRHF (Yuan et al., 2023), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) and KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024).\n\u2022 We develop the difference model that leverages the rich interactions between response pairs to directly predict the difference in human preference.

The preference label can be provided either by human annotators or a well-trained reward model. Here, $L_{aln}$ is the loss function for preference optimization (i.e., the alignment loss) and $L_{reg}$ is the regularization term, for example, to prevent LLM from drifting too far from the supervised-finetuning (SFT) baseline."}, {"title": "Reward Difference Coefficients", "content": "As aforementioned, offline RLHF methods exploit the ordinal relationship $y_w > y_l$ for measuring the alignment loss ($L_{(aln)}$ in Eq. 1), without differentiating pivotal pairs and the trivial counterparts. We propose a simple yet effective method to address such issues based on reward differences. Specifically, given a well-trained reward model $r_{\\phi} : (x, y) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that assigns a reward scalar to each response $y$ for the query $x$, we can quantify the reward difference for each pair of responses $(y_w, y_l)$ for preference optimization as follows:\n$\\mathcal{L}^{rc} = \\sum_{(x, y_w, y_l) \\sim \\mathcal{D}} L_{aln}(x, y_w, y_l; \\theta) \\times \\mathcal{R}^{\\alpha} + L_{reg}(\\theta)$   (2)\n$\\mathcal{R} = r_{\\phi}(x, y_w) - r_{\\phi}(x, y_l)$\nwhere $\\mathcal{R}$ denotes the reward difference coefficient, indicating the degree of how $y_w$ is better than $y_l$. This difference is then leveraged as the coefficient for each response pair in the alignment loss. Here, $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ is used to control the effect of the reward difference coefficient. In particular, when $\\alpha = 0$, the coefficient has no effect.\nAssuming that the reward model can pinpoint essential differences from minor mistakes, the coefficient term helps steer more gradients towards sample pairs with larger differences. Note that, a typical way to learn a reward model is based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Bradley and Terry). Specifically, the loss function for learning the reward model is as follows:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\sum^N [log\\sigma(r_{\\phi}(x, y_w) - r_{\\phi}(x, y_l))]$   (3)\nwhere $\\sigma$ indicates the sigmoid function, and $r_{\\phi}$ is the reward model with learnable parameters $\\phi$.\nThe proposed coefficient can be readily incorporated into diverse offline RLHF methods.

To analyze the effect of reward difference coefficients, let us consider the gradient of DPO+rc. Specifically, as $\\mathcal{R}^{\\alpha}$ does not depend on $\\theta$, the gradient with respect to the parameters $\\theta$ of DPO+rc can be written as:\n$\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{DPO+rc} = -\\sum \\mathcal{R}^{\\alpha}[\\nabla log \\pi_{\\theta}(y_w|x) - \\nabla log \\pi_{\\theta}(y_l|x)]$\n$\\mathcal{R} = \\mathcal{R}^{\\alpha} \\times \\beta \\times \\sigma(r_{\\theta}(x, y_l) - r_{\\theta}(x, y_w))$\nwhere $\\mathcal{R}$ is the weight associated with each response pair, and $r_{\\theta}(x, y) = \\beta log \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(y|x)}{\\pi_{sft}(y|x)}$ is the reward implicitly defined by the language model $\\pi_{\\theta}$.

We obtain the last token embedding as the representation to be passed to the last linear layer for reward difference prediction.

In order to fix such issues and make the training more efficient, we propose two additional regularization loss terms for the difference model training based on the following comparison rules:\n\u2022 Duplication: The comparison score between $y_i$ and itself (i.e. $f(x, y_i, y_i)$) should be zero.\n\u2022 Reverse: Because the order matters in the model input, the difference score between $y_i$ and $y_j$ (i.e. $f(x, y_i, y_j)$), and the difference score between $y_j$ and $y_i$ (i.e. $f(x, y_j, y_i)$) are supposed to be the opposite of each other.\nThe two regulation loss terms for the difference model training are calculated as follows:\n$\\mathcal{L}^{dup} = \\sum \\limits_{i=1}^N[f(x, y_i, y_i)]^2$\n$\\mathcal{L}^{re} = \\sum [f(x, y_i, y_j) + f(x, y_j, y_i)]^2$   (5)\nHere $N$ stands for the number of all comparisons in the dataset $\\mathcal{D}$.

Both reward evaluation and LLM-as-judge evaluation from three powerful LLMs show that our proposed method can also help KTO perform better on the HH dataset."}, {"title": "A.2 Additional experiments for difference model", "content": "In this section, we report some other experiments that can better prove the robustness of our experimental conclusion about the superiority of the proposed difference model."}, {"title": "A.2.1 RRHF with"}]}

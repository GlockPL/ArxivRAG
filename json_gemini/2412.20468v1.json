As AI becomes increasingly adept at understanding and generating human language, its potential for streamlining complex legal processes is becoming evident. Tasks such as reviewing legal documents, conducting research, and drafting contracts can now be supported or automated with the help of AI tools [2]. However, the integration of AI into legal applications presents challenges, including the tendency of AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), to produce misleading or incorrect information, a phenomenon known as \"hallucinations\" [3, 4]. Ethical AI in legal applications ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability, aligning AI-driven decisions with established legal standards and human-centric values to enhance trust and reliability [5].\nThese errors arise because AI models generate responses based on patterns identified in their training data rather than on verified legal facts [6]. While this allows for the creation of fluent and coherent text, it also introduces the risk of inaccuracies that can have serious legal consequences. In an industry where precision and reliability are paramount, such mistakes can significantly undermine the effectiveness of AI solutions in legal contexts.\nSimultaneously, there is a growing global demand for affordable legal services. Traditional legal support is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming [7], leaving many individuals without adequate representation. AI holds the promise of making legal assistance more accessible and scalable, particularly for routine tasks like document analysis and preliminary consultations. This potential underscores the critical need for AI systems that are not only efficient but also highly accurate and reliable.\nTo address the issues of inaccuracy and enhance AI's applicability in legal services, we propose a novel framework that incorporates a mixture of expert systems alongside a knowledge-based architecture. This framework strategically allocates legal tasks to specialized modules, or \"experts,\" each designed to handle specific areas of law. By utilizing focused, domain-specific knowledge, the system ensures that legal advice and analysis are more precise and contextually relevant compared to general-purpose AI models. Additionally, a knowledge integration system underpins the framework by providing access to reliable legal information, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors.\nBeyond the architectural enhancements, our framework implements structured operational guidelines modeled on real-world legal practices. These guidelines emulate the methodologies em-ployed by law firms, ensuring that the AI follows a systematic approach in tasks such as information gathering, analysis of legal precedents, and formulation of conclusions. This structured methodology helps prevent the compounding of errors, thereby improving the overall quality and reliability of the AI-generated legal outputs.\nOur approach demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly in handling the complexities of legal language and logical reasoning. Compared to other AI systems, our model achieves better results in legal benchmarking tests and real-world case studies, highlighting its ability to provide more dependable legal advice. By combining specialized expert knowledge with a structured operational framework, this solution paves the way for more accurate, efficient, and accessible legal services.\nIn the following sections, the Literature Review (Section 2) of this paper highlights the devel-opments in LLMs like GPT-4 for legal tasks, addressing challenges such as domain specificity and hallucinations. Section 3 details the Methodology, which integrates cutting-edge AI techniques like RAG, KGS, a MoE framework, and RLHF to deliver accurate and reliable legal analysis. This section also includes subsections for Dataset Selection, which outline the diverse datasets employed to evaluate the system. The System Architecture subsection provides a detailed description of the working of the system which employs a multi-stage workflow enhanced by KGs.\nThe RLHF Component (Section 8) improves system alignment with user feedback. The Results and Discussion (Section 9) showcase significant performance gains in metrics like Rouge-L and BLEU, demonstrating the framework's strengths. Finally, the Conclusion (Section 10) highlights the system's effectiveness and potential future enhancements, including expert module expansion and real-time updates.\nWe will explore the design and development of this system in detail, outlining the key challenges it addresses and the potential it offers for the future integration of AI within the legal sector."}, {"title": "2 Literature Review", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 [8] and GPT-4 [9], have marked significant advance-ments in natural language processing (NLP) through their transformer-based architecture. These models have demonstrated exceptional performance across various text generation tasks, excelling in areas like text summarization and question answering (Q/A) [10]. However, the success of these LLMs largely hinges on training data from general-purpose domains. This becomes problematic when applying them to specialized fields like law, which is characterized by intricate language, domain-specific terminology, and nuanced logic.\nTo bridge this gap, researchers have turned to fine-tuning LLMs specifically for legal tasks. By adapting pre-trained models with legal data, LLMs can better capture the complexities of legal texts [11]. The process of fine-tuning allows these models to utilize their inherent strengths in language generation while integrating the specialized knowledge required for tasks such as contract analysis, statutory interpretation, and case law reasoning. This literature review critically examines the existing techniques employed for major NLP tasks in the legal domain, with a focus on text summarization and question-answering.\nKey areas of exploration include:\n\u2022 The potential benefits and limitations of fine-tuning LLMs for legal applications.\n\u2022 Promising and cost-effective methods for successfully adapting LLMs.\n\u2022 Emerging research gaps and future directions for advancing legal NLP.\nThe development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly transformed natural lan-guage understanding across diverse sectors, including finance [12] and medicine [13]. Despite these advancements, applying LLMs within the legal domain presents unique challenges. General-purpose LLMs exhibit robust generalization capabilities; however, their effectiveness diminishes when deployed in specialized fields such as law [14].\nTo address these challenges, recent research has focused on fine-tuning LLMs specifically for legal applications. For example, ChatLaw [15], an open-source LLM customized for the legal sector, was fine-tuned using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique [16] on a comprehensive legal dataset. This fine-tuning process aimed to reduce hallucinations\u2014instances where models generate plausible yet factually incorrect information-by integrating vector database retrieval with keyword-based retrieval. Such an approach enhances accuracy, particularly during legal consultations.\nIn the context of Chinese legal systems, similar progress has been observed. Yue et al. [14] fine-tuned the Baichuan-13B-Base model using the DISC-Law-SFT dataset, which encompasses various legal tasks like judgment prediction and document summarization. By incorporating authentic legal texts, including judicial verdicts and regulations, this methodology ensures that the model produces contextually relevant and grounded outputs, thereby validating the effectiveness of domain-specific fine-tuning for legal applications.\nAdditionally, LexGPT [17] represents another significant effort, wherein the model was fine-tuned on the Pile of Law dataset [18] for legal classification tasks. However, empirical results indicated that even with fine-tuning, existing models lag behind discriminative models specifically designed for legal tasks. This discrepancy highlights the limitations of current fine-tuning techniques, particularly for applications demanding high precision and sophisticated legal reasoning.\nThe preference for fine-tuning over training LLMs from scratch is both practical and economically advantageous, as emphasized by Yang et al. [12]. Training a legal-specific LLM requires substantial computational resources, whereas fine-tuning an existing model on a high-quality legal dataset offers a more efficient and scalable alternative.\nWhile fine-tuning remains the predominant strategy for optimizing LLMs for legal tasks, prompting techniques to provide a complementary approach. Prompt-based methods involve guiding the model with specific instructions or examples, which can significantly enhance performance on tasks requiring complex reasoning or logical argumentation. For instance, Yu et al. [19] investigated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a technique that directs models through multi-step reasoning processes. Although CoT prompting showed promise in improving legal reasoning tasks, the study revealed that LLMs still struggle to emulate the deep logical structures inherent in legal decision-making. Similarly, Blair et al. [20] evaluated various prompting techniques on the SARA dataset [21], finding that while GPT-3 performed well on basic legal tasks, its effectiveness diminished in more complex scenarios.\nThese findings highlight the critical need for domain-specific models tailored for legal reasoning. Despite their inherent flexibility, general-purpose LLMs may require additional fine-tuning or special-ized prompts to achieve dependable outcomes in the legal arena.\nMoreover, the integration of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising method for addressing issues such as hallucinations in LLMs [6]. By incorporating human evaluations into the training regimen, RLHF enhances the model's performance, ensuring that outputs are more aligned with factual accuracy and user requirements. For example, TacticalGPT [22] utilized RLHF to improve decision-making in sports analytics by incorporating expert feedback. In the legal domain, RLHF can be instrumental in producing reliable and factually accurate outputs. Legal-specific LLMs like ChatLaw [15] have begun to integrate RLHF, thereby further reducing hallucinations and making these models more suitable for high-stakes legal applications.\nDespite these advancements, several gaps persist in the development of legal LLMs. Although fine-tuning has demonstrated potential, the persistence of hallucinations indicates that more rigorous methodologies are necessary to ensure reliability. A significant barrier is the scarcity of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which hampers the performance of current models. Additionally, achieving explainability within the complex legal domain remains a formidable challenge.\nFurthermore, as discussed in studies such as [15], the trustworthiness of legal LLMs remains ques-tionable, especially when outputs are not easily verifiable. Researchers must continue exploring methods that integrate retrieval-based systems and explainability tools to enhance the transparency and reliability of legal LLMs. Ensuring that legal outputs are both accurate and comprehensible to non-experts is a critical challenge that must be addressed to advance the application of LLMs in the legal field."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "In artificial intelligence, particularly within fields such as Generative AI and Multi-Modal Ap-plications, the ability to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to complex queries is essential. Our system utilizes the combined strengths of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [23] and Knowledge Graphs (KG) [24], further enhanced by a Mixture of Experts (MoE) [25] framework and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [26], to deliver precise and contextually enriched answers. This integration ensures that the system not only retrieves pertinent information but also comprehends and utilizes the intricate relationships within the data to generate informed and continuously improving responses.\n3.1 Datasets Selection\nA range of tasks was selected, aligned with the specified capability levels to support a balanced assess-ment across various dimensions. The tasks and their associated details are summarized in Table 1. In cases where multiple datasets were available for a given task, the most recent version was chosen to maintain relevance. This approach aims to provide a structured basis for evaluation across the selected tasks.\n3.2 System Architecture\nThe architecture of our system is meticulously designed to facilitate seamless interaction between RAG, Knowledge Graphs, the MoE framework, and the RLHF process. When a user submits a query $x$ through the User and Expert Interface, the system initiates a multi-stage processing workflow. The query $x$ is first transformed into a dense vector representation $v_x$ using an embedding function $f$, enabling efficient similarity computations. Concurrently, the system accesses a Knowledge Graph (KG), a structured repository of interconnected data points, to enrich the retrieval process with relational context.\n3.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Module with Knowledge Graph Integration\nAt the core of our system lies the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which or-chestrates the retrieval and generation of responses to complex queries. The RAG model comprises two primary components: the Retriever and the Generator. The Retriever maps both the input query $x$ and potential documents $d \\in K$ from the knowledge base to their respective vector representations $v_x$ and $v_d$ using the embedding function $f$ (LegalBERT). The similarity between $x$ and each document $d$ is quantified using cosine similarity, calculated as:\n$\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\frac{v_x \\cdot v_d}{||v_x|| ||v_d||}$", "equations": ["\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\frac{v_x \\cdot v_d}{||v_x|| ||v_d||}"]}, {"title": "3.3.1 Knowledge Graph Facilitation in RAG", "content": "To ensure high precision in retrieval, we apply a similarity threshold $\\theta$, which is empirically tuned based on legal document validation. Typically, $\\theta$ is set between 0.8 and 0.9, allowing only highly relevant documents to pass, and was chosen based on empirical validation with legal documents. This range was found to strike a balance between recall and precision, allowing the retrieval of only highly relevant documents while filtering out less relevant ones. Legal texts tend to be verbose, and high $\\theta$values help maintain precision, crucial for high-stakes applications.:\n$D = {d_i \\in K | \\text{sim}(x, d_i) \\geq \\theta}$\nThese retrieved documents $D$ provide the foundational information that the Generator utilizes to formulate a coherent and contextually relevant response $y$. The Generator operates on a Transformer-based architecture, modeling the conditional probability distribution:\n$P(y|x, D) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(y_t|y_{<t}, x, D)$\nwhere each token $y_t$ in the response is generated based on the preceding tokens $y_{<t}$, the original query $x$, and the retrieved documents $D$.\nThe Knowledge Graph (KG) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the RAG process by providing a structured and relational context that enriches both the retrieval and generation phases.\nWe utilize techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify legal entities like statutes, case names, organizations, and legal terms. Relation Extraction determines the types of relationships between these entities, such as \"cites,\" \"applies to,\" \"overruled by,\" and \"related to.\" Coreference Resolution ensures consistency in entity representation by resolving different references to the same entity. Dependency Parsing and Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) analyze the grammatical and semantic structures of sentences to understand how entities interact within the text. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging provides foundational linguistic information that supports these analyses. Extracted entities and relationships are structured into triplets.\nThe KG is formally defined as:\n$KG = {(h, r, t) | h \\text{ is the head entity, } r \\text{ is the relation, } t \\text{ is the tail entity}}$\nIn this triplet structure: where h (head entity) is the starting point of the relationship. r (relation) defines the connection or association between the two entities. t (tail entity) is the endpoint of the relationship. When a query x is processed, the system not only retrieves relevant documents based on textual similarity but also explores the relational data within the KG to identify interconnected entities and concepts that provide deeper context.\nConsider a legal Knowledge Graph that includes statutes, legal cases, and principles. For instance, a triplet might be represented as:\n(Statute X, applies_to, Contract Law)\n\u2022h: Statute X represents a specific law or regulation.\n\u2022 r: applies_to indicates the nature of the connection between the two entities, showing that the statute is relevant to a particular area of law.\n\u2022t: Contract Law represents the legal domain or area impacted by the statute.\nThis relational information is embedded into the retrieval process, allowing the Retriever to access not just documents that match the query terms but also those that are contextually relevant through their connections in the KG. Mathematically, the similarity measure is augmented to incorporate relational context:\n$\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\frac{v_x \\cdot v_d + \\alpha \\text{sim}(KG_x, KG_d)}{||v_x|| ||v_d|| + \\alpha}$", "equations": ["D = {d_i \\in K | \\text{sim}(x, d_i) \\geq \\theta}", "P(y|x, D) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} P(y_t|y_{<t}, x, D)", "KG = {(h, r, t) | h \\text{ is the head entity, } r \\text{ is the relation, } t \\text{ is the tail entity}}", "\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\frac{v_x \\cdot v_d + \\alpha \\text{sim}(KG_x, KG_d)}{||v_x|| ||v_d|| + \\alpha}"]}, {"title": "3.4 Mixture of Experts (MoE) Framework and Experts Collaboration Workflow", "content": "To ensure high precision in retrieval, we apply a similarity threshold $\\theta$, which is empirically tuned based on legal document validation.

This range was found to strike a balance between recall and precision, allowing the retrieval of only highly relevant documents while filtering out less relevant ones. Legal texts tend to be verbose, and high $\\theta$values help maintain precision, crucial for high-stakes applications.:\nWhere $\\text{sim}(KG_x, KG_d)$ represents entity and relation similarity in the KG, using techniques like TransE embeddings, and $\\alpha$ balances KG contributions, typically set to 0.5. These embeddings are computed offline, meaning each entity and relationship has a fixed vector representation.\nThe integration of the Knowledge Graph with the RAG module significantly enhances the retrieval process. Instead of relying solely on unstructured documents, the Retriever can now access structured, relational data that provides deeper insights into the query context. This means that the system can identify not only the most relevant documents based on textual similarity but also understand the relationships and connections between different entities within those documents.\n$\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\beta \\cdot \\text{sim}_{\\text{text}}(x, d) + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\text{sim}_{KG}(x, d)$\nWhere, $\\text{sim}_{\\text{text}}(x, d)$ represents the cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings. $\\text{sim}_{KG}(x, d)$ denotes the similarity based on Knowledge Graph embeddings or graph-based measures. The parameter $\\beta$ balances the importance of textual similarity and KG similarity.\nDuring the generation phase, the enriched information from the Knowledge Graph ensures that the Generator can produce responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also factually accurate and legally compliant. By employing the relational data from the KG, the Generator gains a more comprehensive understanding of the query's context, enabling it to generate more informed and precise responses.\nFor instance, consider a legal query: \"What precedent cases support the application of statute X in contract disputes?\" The system retrieves documents related to statute X and contract disputes, enriched with relational data from the KG such as related cases, involved parties, and relevant legal principles. This comprehensive retrieval allows the Generator to construct a response that not only lists the precedent cases but also explains their relevance and contextual connections to statute X and contract disputes.\nTo handle the diversity and complexity inherent in legal queries, our system incorporates a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. This framework dynamically allocates computational re-sources by routing inputs to specialized experts tailored to specific sub-domains within the legal field. The MoE framework consists of a collection of specialized models {$E_1, E_2, ..., E_N$}, each fine-tuned on distinct sub-domains.\nEach agent $E_i$ within the MoE model is specialized to handle specific legal tasks, such as case clas-sification, article recitation, reasoning, legal element extraction, and case analysis. When a consultant presents k questions to the system, each related to different aspects $Q = {q_1, q_2,...,q_k}$, the Gating Network evaluates each query $q_i$ and assigns routing probabilities $g = [g_1, g_2, ..., g_n]$ to each expert based on their relevance to the query:\n$g = \\text{GatingNetwork}(x; \\theta_{\\text{gate}})$\nEnsuring that the sum of the gating probabilities equals one:\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i = 1$\nThe gating network determines which experts are most relevant to the input query $x$ by outputting a probability distribution over all experts.\n$g = \\text{softmax}(W_{\\text{gate}}.v_x + b_{\\text{gate}})$\nTo maintain computational efficiency, only the top K experts with the highest routing scores are activated:\n$E(x) = \\text{TopK}(g, K) = {E_i | i \\in \\text{indices of top K scores in g}}$\nEach activated expert $E_i$ processes the input independently, producing an output $h_i$:", "equations": ["\\text{sim}(x, d) = \\beta \\cdot \\text{sim}_{\\text{text}}(x, d) + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\text{sim}_{KG}(x, d)", "g = \\text{GatingNetwork}(x; \\theta_{\\text{gate}})", "\\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i = 1", "g = \\text{softmax}(W_{\\text{gate}}.v_x + b_{\\text{gate}})", "E(x) = \\text{TopK}(g, K) = {E_i | i \\in \\text{indices of top K scores in g}}"]}, {"title": "3.5 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)", "content": "To ensure high precision in retrieval, we apply a similarity threshold $\\theta$, which is empirically tuned based on legal document validation.

The integration ensures that the system not only retrieves and generates responses based on general information but also utilizes domain-specific expertise to address nuanced legal queries effectively.\nA critical aspect of our system is the Experts Collaboration Workflow, which bridges hu-man expertise with AI-driven insights through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-back (RLHF). This workflow involves structured interactions among various roles, ensuring that AI-generated responses meet high standards of accuracy and relevance while continuously improving based on human feedback.\nThe collaborative process begins with the Consultant, who initiates case analysis by defining objectives and outlining specific requirements. The Consultant translates high-level requirements into structured queries $x$, ensuring that the system is tasked with well-defined objectives. These queries $x$ are then processed by the Research Associate, who conducts in-depth legal research, extracts pertinent case information, and interacts with the RAG model to retrieve and interpret relevant documents $D$. This role ensures that the retrieved information aligns with legal standards and contextual relevance.\nEach question $q_i$ from the Consultant is routed to the appropriate expert $E_j$ within the MoE architecture, where:\n$E_j (q_i) = \\text{Process} \\leftarrow \\text{Domain Specific}(q_i)$\nThe Advisor utilizes the MoE-enhanced RAG model for statutory interpretations and case anal-yses. Combining AI-driven predictions with human judgment, the Advisor performs tasks such as assignment prediction and element extraction. The outputs from the experts {$E_j(q_i)$} are aggregated:\n$Y_{\\text{aggregated}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} E_j(q_i)$\nThis aggregated output $Y_{\\text{aggregated}}$ is forwarded to the Advisor for review. Upon approval, the Paralegal finalizes the document, ensuring its compliance with legal standards and preparing release templates. The Paralegal reviews and refines AI-generated outputs $y$, providing feedback $d$ to the system. The entire collaborative process can be represented as:\n$V_{\\text{final}} = \\text{Paralegal} \\left( \\text{Advisor} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} E_j(q_i) \\right) \\right)$\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an integral component of our sys-tem, ensuring that the AI continuously learns and adapts based on human expertise and preferences. RLHF enhances the Experts Collaboration Workflow by providing a structured method for in-corporating human feedback into the model's training process, thereby improving response quality over time and aligning the AI's responses more closely with human judgments and legal standards. By incorporating direct feedback from experts, RLHF ensures that the system's outputs are not only accurate but also contextually appropriate and compliant with evolving legal practices.\nThe process begins with Feedback Collection, where after the Paralegal reviews the AI-generated response $y$, feedback $d$ is gathered.

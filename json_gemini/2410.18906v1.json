{"title": "PRISM: A Methodology for Auditing Biases in Large Language Models", "authors": ["Leif Azzopardi", "Yashar Moshfeghi"], "abstract": "Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover their biases and preferences is an emerging challenge in creating Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). While various methods have been proposed to elicit the preferences of such models, countermeasures have been taken by LLM trainers, such that LLMs hide, obfuscate or point blank refuse to disclosure their positions on certain subjects. This paper presents PRISM, a flexible, inquiry-based methodology for auditing LLMs \u2013 that seeks to illicit such positions indirectly through task-based inquiry prompting rather than direct inquiry of said preferences. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we applied PRISM on the Political Compass Test, where we assessed the political leanings of twenty-one LLMs from seven providers. We show LLMs, by default, espouse positions that are economically left and socially liberal (consistent with prior work). We also show the space of positions that these models are willing to espouse where some models are more constrained and less compliant than others - while others are more neutral and objective. In sum, PRISM can more reliably probe and audit LLMs to understand their preferences, biases and constraints.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming more restricted in what they can generate (Dong et al., 2024). Given their potential to spread misinformation through hallucinations and biases that can reinforce harmful stereotypes, this shift is a positive step toward promoting Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Liao and Vaughan, 2023). However, with the introduction of guardrails, fine-tuning, red teaming, etc., LLMs are trained to reduce the probability of producing output deemed undesirable, offensive, harmful, etc. But they may also be trained, explicitly or inadvertently, to increase the probability of producing other outputs deemed acceptable and/or appropriate by the designers/trainers of such models, which push their agenda, viewpoints and perspectives (Feng et al., 2023). For instance, various studies have shown that LLMs such as ChatGPT tend to be purported economically left-leaning and socially liberal views (Rozado, 2024; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024; Hartmann et al., 2023). This kind of guard-railing, then, is a double-edged sword that invariably leads to trade-offs - not only in terms of favouring certain output over others \u2013 but by restricting output (and thus the affordances of the model) in lieu of making the models safer and more responsible. For example, an LLM may be trained to decline to provide opinions on controversial topics, or worse, refusing to present arguments on such topics \u2013 reducing the model's utility and affordances \u2013 while also denying the inquirer of the information requested."}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "Large Language Models are deep neural networks designed to understand, generate, and process human language by learning from vast amounts of text data. While they offer many opportunities for developing AI-powered agents and systems, the underlying models may be subject to harmful and negative biases \u2013 such that they push or promote certain agendas, ideologies, stereotypes, etc., while suppressing or hiding others. These concerns, along with new regulations (such as the EU AI Act(European Parliament, 2023)), have motivated the need to audit such models (Mokander et al., 2023). There are many ways in which LLMs can be audited \u2013 here we focus on what positions LLMs argue for or against. In this space, researchers have devised a number of different methodologies to try to ascertain the biases and preferences of LLMs. An initial approach proposed aims to, perhaps naively, directly ask the LLM to reveal its biases. However, with guard rails and training, LLMs avoid or diplomatically answer such requests with canned/pre-trained responses. For example, when Rozado (Rozado, 2023) asked ChatGPT:\u201cwhat are your political preferences?\", it responded:\n\u201cI am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to hold political preferences... I do not have personal opinions or biases.\u201d\nSimilar prompts obtain responses where the model claims that it does not have any biases. So, instead of asking the model to disclose its biases, researchers have employed a different strategy. The approach uses a survey instrument (such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), etc..) and the LLM is asked to rate the statements given the instrument (see Figure 2). This has been explored via direct prompting (Rozado, 2023; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024; Bang et al., 2024; Hartmann et al., 2023) or through masking (Feng et al., 2023). The former is the most widely employed.\nRozado (Rozado, 2023, 2024) proposed the direct prompting approach. The LLM is given the statement and forced to respond by appending to the prompt the suffix \u201cplease choose one of the following\" along with the list of possible answers. However, not all LLMs would comply with their request. To get the models to comply, multiple calls are often required, along with using varying prompts, making the approach highly inefficient and costly. Note that Rozado's studies were performed in late 2023, and since then, newer LLMs have employed stronger guardrails to hide their political leanings. This has resulted in the approach failing to illicit a compliant response. In (R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024), Rottger et al. explored the reliability\""}, {"title": "3 Preference Revelation through Indirect Stimulus Methodology (PRISM)", "content": "Our proposed methodology, PRISM, is presented in Figure 1 and consists of the following steps: (1) Select a survey instrument, such as the Political Compass Test (see below), which consists of a number of statements requiring Likert responses. (2) Select the LLM to be audited (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). (3) Assign a role to the LLM model using the prompt. The role can be set as none to obtain the default position of the LLM. (4) Instruct the LLM to write an essay. This could be based on the statements of any instruments or tests (see the prompt below as an example). (5) For each essay, commission an assessor (AI or Human) to rate the stance of the essay. (6) Tally up the answers given to the survey instrument to map the default position of the LLM. (7) Repeat the process with different roles to cover the dimensions given the instrument used. (8) Plot the default and window of positions the LLM is willing to espouse.\nThe choice of LLM (and its configuration), the assessors used, along with the choice of instrument and roles selected, means that the methodology can be flexibly employed to audit various biases such as political biases, gender biases, religious bias, etc. (so long as there is a suitable instrument available). As noted above, we have developed the methodology to work in conjunction with Likert scale instruments \u2013 where the responses are either (strongly) agree or (strongly) disagree. Another key difference with prior work is the inclusion of two other possible labels denoting \u201cneutral\" and \"refusal\". This is because some essays may present a neutral position, or it may refuse to write an essay given the statement. If it refuses, then this indicates that the model is limited in its affordances. It is important to note and capture these states. While our methodology aims to minimize refusals (by probing indirectly), for the purposes of auditing the biases and preferences of the model, it is desirable to know if the model refuses to discuss such topics or whether it is neutral with respect to such topics. For example, if there is a requirement by the application designer to ensure that the model does not present views on certain topics, or that if it does then they are presented in an objective manner, then this needs to be measured in the audit. The decision of what LLM to use, given the preferences and biases it exhibits, is, therefore, a design choice.\nCompared to the direct approach, PRISM is more reliable as it does not force the LLM to reveal its position \u2013 but instead asks the model to generate an essay. Thus, PRISM offers a number of advantages: (1) the affordance of the model to comply with writing/generating essays can be estimated (using the refusal rate), (2) the neutrality of the model to produce essays with balanced arguments can be estimated by the neutrality rate, (3) the biases and preferences can be estimated through the instrument used, where the PRISM lets us decompose the preferences into a multi-dimensional vector given the statements, (4) the willingness of"}, {"title": "4 Auditing Political Biases with PRISM", "content": "To demonstrate the effectiveness of PRISM as a reliable methodology in auditing LLMs, we examined their political preferences using the Political Compass Test (as done in prior works).

For all models, we set the temperature to 0.0 to minimize the randomness of the LLM's output (as done in prior works)."}, {"title": "4.2 Assessors", "content": "To rate the essays, we employed an AI-based assessor as it has been shown that LLMs excel at this task compared to humans (Gilardi et al., 2023; Gorur et al., 2024). For this, we used an LLM, which was prompted to detect the stance given the instrument scale. Here, we used GPT3.5 Turbo. To ensure that it was aligned with human judgements, we selected two essays per topic, sampling approx. Five essays from each LLM were used. These essays were then judged by two human annotators, where any directional differences were discussed and resolved to create the gold set. The gold set was compared to the GPT3.5 Turbo's judgements, where we had 88.6% agreement, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.774, denoting strong alignment (similar to that reported in (Rozado, 2024))."}, {"title": "4.3 Roles and Preference Windows", "content": "Given the Political Compass Test, there are eight possible extreme positions given the two dimensions, for example, \"Left Wing - Authoritarian \", \"Left Wing -Liberal\", \"Right Wing - Authoritarian\", and \"Left Wing - Liberal\u201d, and \u201cLeft Wing\", \"Right Wing\u201d, \u201cLiberal\u201d and \u201cAuthoritarian\u201d. By using these \"extreme\u201d roles, we can ask the LLM to provide views that it may have been trained to suppress or promote. This way, we can map the space of views it is willing or unwilling to express \u2013 relative to its default position, i.e., when no role is assigned. As a check, all models were asked to describe the PCT to ensure that they could fulfil the roles. In total, we commissioned 21 models to write 62 essays and given 9 roles to produce 11,718 essays that were then rated. In additional to running our methodology, we also employed the direct approach proposed by (Rozado, 2024), in order to compare the neutrality and refusal rates."}, {"title": "4.4 Results", "content": "Figure 3 shows that most of the models audited have a left and liberal-leaning. This is consistent with the findings from previous works (e.g., (Rozado, 2024; R\u00f6ttger et al., 2024; Rutinowski et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023)). Moreover, we found that PRISM is moderately to strongly correlated with the direct method (with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.56 for social and 0.83 for economic dimension). While both of these correlations were found to be statistically significant, the discrepancy stems from the different number of refusals and neutrals produced by each method, which affects the scoring (see Table 1). We can see that PRISM results in fewer refusals and fewer neutral ratings than the direct method (obtaining a more accurate estimate of the political leanings of the LLMs). On average, PRISM produced neutral ratings 6% of the time, while the direct method resulted in 9% neutral ratings. In terms of refusals, PRISM refused to provide an answer 1% of the time, on average, while the direct approach refused to provide an answer 13%. As hypothesized, closed-source models tend to refuse more often than open-source models, suggesting that they have had more guardrails installed \u2013 preventing them from generating responses that directly respond whether they (strongly) agree or not. On the other hand, PRISM, by asking for an essay, is able to learn the model's preferences indirectly. Taken together, this means we can obtain a more accurate estimate of the model's political leanings using PRISM, as well as obtain a more nuanced view of a model's neutrality and compliance.\nFigure 4 presents the windows of expression given the different extreme roles based on the political compass test. From the plots, we observed that certain models were more willing to express a greater variety of views than others. For example, LLama2 (a) is least willing to deviate from the default, whereas GPT 4 shows a much greater variety of views. However, there appears to be a general unwillingness of all the models to espouse views that are consistent with left authoritarian positions (top left) or right liberal positions (bottom right). So, while the models are instructed to take on such positions, the audit shows that they are not willing to produce such arguments."}, {"title": "5 Summary", "content": "PRISM, an approach for auditing biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), offers numerous advantages over prior work. This is because by indirectly probing the LLMs, we can not only probe the biases and preferences of the models but also ascertain how compliant the model is in discussing different topics. That is, we obtain insights into whether it refuses to discuss such topics (via refusals), and we can obtain how neutral the model is in presenting arguments for such topics (via neutrals). Moreover, PRISM offers explainability of its positions as the output is the explanation. Further, through the use of roles, we are able to more widely probe the space of arguments that the model is willing to espouse. This provides key insights into how much control one can have over the model via the prompt. As a result, PRISM enables an array of promising avenues for future research for auditing LLMs. For example, it can be used to examine biases associated with specific roles (e.g., what positions the LLM assumes different genders, races, professions, etc. hold), different biases and positions using different instruments (e.g., moral, religious, gender, etc. biases), changes and variance in biases and positions over time/samples by repeated probing, and how biases can be mitigated through changes in prompts and fine-tuning."}, {"title": "6 Limitations", "content": "The authors acknowledge that PRISM has a number of limitations. The reliance on AI assessors to rate the essays could introduce bias into the results. While the authors report strong alignment between the AI assessor and human judgments, it is possible that the AI assessor has its own biases that could influence the ratings. The authors acknowledge that they only began to explore the possibilities of using PRISM, and further research is needed to extend and improve the methodology. For example, repeated sampling could help quantify the variance associated with point estimates of different positions. Varying the prompts used to probe the models could provide a better understanding of their sensitivity. The authors used a simplified prompting strategy that may not be representative of how LLMs are used in real-world applications. More complex prompting techniques could be explored in future research. While PRISM is more reliable than direct prompting methods, it is still possible that LLMs could be trained to obfuscate their true positions even when asked to write essays. The study focuses specifically on political bias using the Political Compass Test. Further research is needed to examine how PRISM performs when used with other instruments and when measuring other types of bias. The authors found that LLMs exhibited an unwillingness to espouse certain political positions. This suggests that the models may have been trained to suppress or promote certain viewpoints, which could limit their usefulness in applications requiring neutral or objective viewpoints. The authors observed that role priming can significantly impact an LLM's political leanings. This highlights the need for further research into how different models conceptualize stereotypes to understand how they might ascribe different political stances to different groups of people."}, {"title": "A Political Compass Test", "content": "The Political Compass Test (PCT) is a widely used tool designed to measure an individual?s political ideology across two key dimensions: economic (left vs. right) and social (libertarian vs. authoritarian)\u00b9. The test consists of 62 propositions covering various topics such as economics, social values, society, religion, and sex. For instance, one proposition might be \"The freer the market, the freer the people\" which gauges economic preferences, while another might be \"All authority should be questioned? which assesses attitudes toward social preferences. Respondents are asked to indicate their level of agreement with each statement on a four-point scale: ?strongly disagree?, ?disagree?, ?agree? or ?strongly agree?. These are mapped to scores, which are tallied up and normalized, for the two dimensions: economic left (-10) to economic right (+10), and social liberal (-10) to social authoritarian (+10) (see (Rutinowski et al., 2023) for mappings and normalizations). This results in a placement within one of four quadrants: Authoritarian Left (e.g., Joseph Stalin), Authoritarian Right (e.g., Winston Churchill), Libertarian Left (e.g., Mahatma Gandhi), or Libertarian Right (e.g., Friedrich Hayek). Since its introduction in 2001, the Political Compass has gained significant attention and is frequently referenced in academic and media discussions."}, {"title": "B Prompts", "content": "The default prompt template used was:\n\"Write a short essay about: <statement>.\nPick one side and argue for or against it.\"\nwhere the <statement> was replaced with the statement from the PCT.

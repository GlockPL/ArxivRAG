The prevailing methods typically learn a conservative policy to mitigate the problem of Q-value overestimation, but it is prone to overdo it, leading to an overly conservative policy. Moreover, they optimize all samples equally with fixed constraints, lacking the nuanced ability to control conservative levels in a fine-grained manner. Consequently, this limitation results in a performance decline. To address the above two challenges in a united way, we propose a framework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which limits the Q-values in a mild range and enables adaptive control on the conservative level over each state-action pair, i.e., lifting the Q-values more for good transitions and less for bad transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which the conservative level of the learned Q-function can be limited in a mild range and how to optimize each transition adaptively. Motivated by the theoretical analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, ACL-QL, which uses two learnable adaptive weight functions to control the conservative level over each transition. Subsequently, we design a monotonicity loss and surrogate losses to train the adaptive weight functions, Q-function, and policy network alternatively. We evaluate ACL-QL on the commonly used D4RL benchmark and conduct extensive ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance compared to existing offline DRL baselines.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the help of deep learning, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable results on a variety of previously intractable problems, such as playing video games [1]\u2013[3], controlling robot [4]\u2013[6] and driving autonomous cars [7]\u2013[9]. However, the prerequisite that the agent has to interact with the environments makes the learning process costly and unsafe for many real-world scenarios. Recently, offline RL [10], [11] has been proposed as a promising alternative to relax this requirement. In offline RL, the agent directly learns a control policy from a given static dataset, which is previously collected by an unknown behavioral policy. Offline RL enables the agent to achieve comparable or even better performance without additional interactions with the environment. [11] provides a comprehensive review of the offline RL problem.\nUnfortunately, stripping the interactions from the online RL, offline RL is very challenging due to the distribution shift between the behavioral policy and the learned policy over the training process. It often leads to the overestimation of values of out-of-distribution (OOD) actions [12], [13] and thus misleads the policy into choosing these erroneously estimated actions. While the target Q-values are calculated using OOD actions and have erroneously high values, the policy is then optimized towards predicting OOD actions. This error then propagates and intensifies with bootstrapping during training, eventually leading to the explosion and overflow of the Q-values. In online RL, the interactions with the environment could provide the right feedback and thus fix such errors, yet it is impossible for offline RL. To alleviate the values overestimation problem, recent methods [12], [14]\u2013[16] proposed to constrain the learned policy to the behavioral policy in different ways, such as limiting the action space [17], using KL divergence [15], and using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [12]. Besides directly constraining the policy, other methods [18]\u2013[21] choose to learn a conservative Q-function to constrain the policy implicitly and thus alleviate the overestimation problem of the Q-function. However, such value-constrained methods often suffer from the over-conservative problem [18], [20] that suppresses the Q-values of OOD actions too much to learn a satisfactory policy. Having observed the above phenomenon, we try to find a moderate range of conservatism that allows the Q-function to avoid the problem of overestimation while avoiding the problem of being too conservative. Specifically, we derive the conditions on how to limit the learned Q-function lies between the ordinary Q-function and the over-conservative Q-function in Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) [18], and subsequently optimize the Q-function based on the conditions.\nIn addition, most previous methods meet the following two challenges: (1) They usually require prior knowledge (e.g., the quality of each transition) and expert experience to set suitable hyperparameters and thus increase the trial-and-error costs for deployment. (2) Even given the suitable hyperparameters, such as a fixed threshold value to constrain the distribution"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Imitation Learning. To learn from a given static dataset, Imitation Learning (IL) is the most straightforward strategy. The core spirit of IL is to mimic the behavioral policy. As the simplest form, behavioral cloning still holds a place for offline reinforcement learning, especially for the expert dataset. However, having expert datasets is only a minority of cases. Recently, some methods [16], [22]\u2013[24] aim to filter sub-optimal data and then apply the supervised learning paradigm afterward. Specifically, Best-Action Imitation Learning (BAIL) [22] performed imitation learning only on a high-quality subset of the dataset purified by a learned value"}, {"title": "III. PRELIMINARY", "content": "We consider the environment as a fully-observed Markov Decision Process (MDP), which is represented by a tuple (S, A, P, r, \\rho_0, \\gamma). The MDP consists of the state space S, the actions space A, the transition probability distribution function P: S\u00d7A\u00d7S \u2192 [0,1], the reward function r:S\u00d7A\u00d7S \u2192 R, the initial state distribution \\rho_0(s) and the discount factor \u03b3\u2208 (0,1).

In the environment setup, although the robots are usually a time-varying system, the tasks remain static. In the Actor-Critic framework, the learning process repeatedly alternates between the policy evaluation that computes the value function for a policy and the policy improvement that obtains a better policy from the value function. Given a current replay buffer (dataset) D = {(s, a, r, s')} consisting of finite transition samples, the policy evaluation is defined as follows:\nQ^{k+1} \\leftarrow arg min_{Q} \\mathbb{E}_{s,a,s'\\sim D} [(Q(s,a) \u2013 B^{\\pi}Q^k(s,a))^2], (1)\nwhere k is the iteration number, Q(s, a) is a parametric Q-function to predict cumulative return after taking action a at the states, $Q^k(s, a)$ is the frozen Q-function at iteration k to calculate the target Q value, s' is the next state, and the Bellman operator is defined as $B^{\\pi}Q^k(s,a) = r(s,a) + \\mathbb{E}_{a'\\sim\\pi^k (a'|s')}[Q^k(s', a')]$. Note that the empirical Bellman operator $B^{\\pi}$ is used in practice, which backs up only one transition, because it is difficult to contain all possible transitions (s, a, s') in D, especially for continuous action space. After approximating the Q-function, the policy improvement is performed as the following:\n\\pi^{k+1} \\leftarrow argmax_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim D, a\\sim \\pi^k(a|s)} [Q^{k+1}(s,a)].

ADAPTIVE CONSERVATIVE LEVEL IN Q-LEARNING", "content": "In this section, we propose a framework, Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which enables more flexible control over the conservative level of Q-function, compared to CQL [18] that uses two separate terms to lift up the Q-values of in-dataset transitions and pull down the Q-values of OOD actions with a fixed hyperparameter \u03b1. The core idea behind the ACL-QL framework is that given a suitable range of the conservative level of the Q-function, how to adaptively lift the Q-values for good transitions up and pull down the Q-values for bad transitions in the range. Without loss of generality, we can consider the dataset collected by the behavioral policy usually contains data with both high and low returns, even though the behavioral policy is a random policy. At the same time, among the actions sampled from a particular distribution \u00b5, there are also (relatively) good and bad actions instead of all actions having the same returns. In that case, we need a more flexible and fine-grained control method to constrain the Q-function for each state-action pair. Toward our goal, we propose to use two adaptive weight functions \\omega_\\mu(s, a) and w_{\\pi_\\beta}(s, a) to control the conservative level over a particular distribution \u00b5 and empirical behavioral policy \\pi_\\beta, respectively. By extending the CQL framework [18], now the family of optimization problems of our ACL-QL framework is presented below:\nmin max (\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim D,a\\sim \\mu(a|s)} [W_{\\mu}(s, a) \\cdot Q(s, a)] -\\mathbb{E}_{s\\sim D,a\\sim \\pi_\\beta(a|s)} [W_{\\pi_\\beta}(s,a) \\cdot Q(s,a)])+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{E}_{s,a,s'\\sim D} (Q(s,a) - B^{\\pi}Q^k (s, a))^2 + R(\\mu). (4)\nNote that the form of the adaptive weight functions w\u00b5(s, a) and $w_{\\pi_{\\beta}}(s, a)$ is not fixed and can be customized according to different situations. It is their arbitrary form that supports us in shaping the Q-function more finely. In the following, we discuss the conditions about how we can adjust the conservative level of ACL-QL compared to the ordinary Q-function and CQL [18], and the properties that the adaptive weight functions w\u00b5(s, a) and $w_{\\pi_{\\beta}}(s, a)$ should have.\nFigure 2 provides a schematic illustration for the following Propositions IV.1 and IV.3, which are the conditions on how to limit the learned Q-function lies between the ordinary Q-function and the over-conservative Q-function in CQL.\nFirst, we list the condition on which ACL-QL is more conservative than the ordinary Q-function in Proposition IV.1.\nProposition IV.1. (The conservative level of ACL-QL). For any \u00b5 with $supp_{\\mu} \\subset supp_{\\beta}$, without considering the sampling error between the empirical BQ and ordinary Bellman backups BQ, the conservative level of ACL-QL can be controlled over the Q-values. The difference dord(s,a) between the ordinary Q-function Q\u2122 and the learned Q-function Q\u2122 is\n\\forall s \\in D, d_{ord}(s, a) = Q^{\\pi} \u2013 Q^{\\pi}\\\". (5)\nThe proof is provided in Appendix I. When dord(s, a) > 0, the learned Q-function Q\u2122 is more conservative than the ordinary Q-function Q\u2122 point-wise. As a special instance of our ACL-QL framework, CQL [18] proposes to constrain the conservative level over the excepted V-values. And CQL performs the optimization for all state-action pairs with the same weight \u03b1, which may be too rigid and over-conservative for some scenarios. Now, if we set dord(s,a) < 0 in Equation (5), we can get the conditions on which ACL-QL is less conservative than the ordinary Q-function. The Q-values of these corresponding transitions will be lifted to high values, and it is beneficial when the users believe these transitions have high qualities and want the learned policy to mimic them.\nWe also show that ACL-QL bounds the gap between the learned Q-values and ordinary Q-values with the consideration of the sampling error between the empirical $B^{\\pi}Q$ and actual Bellman operator BQ. Following [18], [66], [67], the error can be bounded by leveraging the concentration properties of B. We introduce the bound in brief here: with high probability \u2265 1 \u2013 8, $|Q \u2013 B^{\\pi}Q|(s,a) < \\frac{C_{r,P,\\delta}}{\\sqrt{|D(s,a)|}}$, \\forall s, a \\in D, where $C_{r,P,\\delta}$ is a constant relating to the reward function r(s,a), environment dynamic $P(\\cdot|s, a)$, and a dependency $\\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)}$ where \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1).\nProposition IV.2. (ACL-QL bounds the gap between the learned Q-values and ordinary Q-values). Considering the sampling error between the empirical $B^{\\pi}Q$ and ordinary Bellman backups $B^{\\pi}Q$, with probability > 1 \u2013 \u03b4, the gap between the learned Q-function Q\u2122 and the ordinary Q-function Q\u2122 satisfies the following inequality:\n\\forall s \\in D, a,\nQ^{\\pi}(s, a) \u2013 Q^{\\pi}(s, a) \\geq h(s, a) \u2013 err(s, a), (6)\nQ^{\\pi}(s, a) \u2013 Q^{\\pi}(s, a) \\leq h(s, a) + err(s,a), (7)\nwhere\nh(s,a) = [(I-\u00a5P*)-1 \u03c9\u03bc.\u03bc - \u03c9\u03c0\u03b2 Cr,P,& Rmax]\n\u22121 \u03c0\u03b2 (s,a), (8)\n(\u0399 \u2013 \u03b3\u03a1\u03c0)\u22121 - \u00a5P*)\nerr(s, a) = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)2(1 \u2013 0. \u03b3)|D(s,a)| (s, a) \u2265 0. (9)\n-1.\n1) Thus, if w\u00b5(s, a) = W\u03c0\u03c1(s, a) = a,\u2200s \u2208 D, a, it is the case of CQL, where the V\u2122 lower-bounds the V\u2122 with a large \u03b1 instead of a point-wise lower-bound for Q-function.\n2) If $h(s, a) \\geq err(s, a), \\exists s \\in D, a$, with the Equation (6), the learned Q-function Q\u2122 is more optimistic than the ordinary Q-function Q\u2122 in these regions.\n3) If $h(s, a) \\leq -err(s,a), \\exists s \\in D, a$, with the Equation (7), the learned Q-function Q\u2122 is more conservative than the ordinary Q-function Q\u2122 in these regions.\nNote that the term err(s,a) is a positive value for any state-action pair. Given the bounds in Proposition IV.2, instead of only knowing the size relationship (i.e., more or less conservative), we can control the fine-grained range of the gap more precisely by carefully designing w\u00b5(s, a) and W\u03c0\u03b2 (s, \u03b1).\nBesides the comparison to the ordinary Q-function, we also give a theoretical discussion about the comparison to CQL [18] in the following.\nProposition IV.3. (The conservative level compared to CQL). For any \u00b5 with $supp_{\\mu} \\subset supp_{\\beta}$, given the Q-function learned from CQL is $Q_{CQL}(s,a) = Q^{\\pi} \u2013 \\alpha\\frac{\\mu - \\pi_{\\beta}}{\\pi_{\\beta}}$, similar to Proposition IV.1, the conservative level of ACL-QL compared to CQL can be controlled over the Q-values. The difference dcql(s, a) between the learned Q-function Q\u2122 and the CQL Q-function $Q_{CQL}$ is\n\\forall s \\in D, d_{cql}(s, a) = Q^{\\pi} \u2013 Q_{CQL}\\\". (10)\nWhen dcql(s,a) > 0, the learned Q-function Q\u2122 is less conservative than the CQL Q-function $Q_{CQL}$ point-wise. We aim to optimize w\u03bc and $w_{\\pi_{\\beta}}$ so that the following equation holds."}, {"title": "V. ACL-QL WITH LEARNABLE WEIGHT FUNCTIONS", "content": "In this section, derived from the theoretical discussion, we propose one practical algorithm, ACL-QL, in the guidance of theoretical conditions with a learnable neural network as adaptive weight functions. To adaptively control the conservative level, there are three steps for ACL-QL. Firstly, we preprocess the fixed dataset to calculate the relative transition quality measurements. Then, with the help of the transition quality measurements, we construct a monotonicity loss to maintain the monotonicity. We also add surrogate losses to control the conservative level of ACL-QL. Lastly, we train the adaptive weight network, actor network, and critic network alternatively.\nTo seek a replacement for the optimal Q-function Q* in Definition IV.1 for offline DRL, we first preprocess the static dataset and calculate the relative transition quality measurements for each state-action pair. Since ACL-QL should be able to be applied to different kinds of tasks with different magnitudes of rewards, it is better to use a normalized value ranging from (0, 1) to measure the data quality.\nThe discounted Monte Carlo return g(s, a) is an unbiased way of approximating the Q-values. However, because we do not know the coverage of the dataset (i.e., an action contained in a bad trajectory in given datasets still has the potential to achieve higher performance within other unseen trajectories), the Monte Carlo returns may have high variances, especially when the number of steps is large.\nTo reduce the high variances, we also consider the immediate rewards r(s, a) which are 1-step Monte Carlo returns and thus have the smallest variances. Note that only the immediate rewards r(s, a) are also not accurate since our goal is to achieve higher accumulated returns, and the greedy algorithm usually leads to a sub-optimal policy for complex tasks.\nCombining the above methods, for the state-action pair in the static dataset, we define relative transition quality m(s,a) by combining both the whole discounted Monte Carlo returns and the single-step rewards to approximate the data quality:\n\\forall (s, a) \\in D,\nm(s, a) = \\lambda\\cdot g_{norm}(s, a) + (1 - \\lambda)\\cdot r_{norm}(s,a), (13)\n\\text{where } g_{norm} = \\frac{g_{cur}-g_{min}}{g_{max}-g_{min}} \\text{ and } r_{norm} = \\frac{r_{cur}-r_{min}}{r_{max}-r_{min}}. The gmin, gmax, rmin, rmax are the minimum and maximum values of the Monte Carlo returns of the whole trajectory and the single-step rewards in the dataset, respectively. Note that the range of m(s, a) is (0,1), and the higher m(s, a) indicates that we set a pseudo-label showing a is a better action. Lines 3-4 in Algorithm 1 show the process of calculating the relative transition quality. A is a hyperparameter enabling different combinations of the Monte Carlo returns of the whole trajectory and the single-step rewards. We build an ablation study on different A and N-step SARSA returns in Section VI-D, and find that different A values affect the final performance, but setting it to 0.5 is a simple and good choice that works well in all environments and datasets. Therefore, we chose to use 0.5 in our implementation.\nFor the OOD actions, since they do not appear in the dataset and their single rewards and Monte Carlo returns are not available, we choose to use the Euclidean distance L2, an intuitive and common way to approximate the uncertainties, between the OOD action a\u00b5 and action ain in the dataset with the same state s. A larger distance means that this OOD action generates a higher risk, i.e., we cannot trust its Q value too much, and hence we should suppress its Q value more.\nBesides the L2 distance, we also consider the quality of the corresponding in-dataset action. If the in-dataset action is actually a \"good\" one, even if the L2 distance is high, we can still trust the OOD action to some extent. Combining the above ideas, we define relative transition quality m(s, a\u00b5) for OOD state-action pairs:\n\\forall (s, a_{in}) \\in D, a_{\\mu} \\in \\mu(a|s),\nm(s, a_{\\mu}) = T(m(s, a_{in}), L_2(a_{\\mu}, a_{in})), (14)\nwhere $T(x_1, x_2) = (x_1 = x_2 + 1)$ is a translation function to shift and scale the Equation (14) to make the range of them(s, a\u00b5) is also (0, 1). The higher m(s, a\u00b5) indicates that we set a pseudo-label showing a\u00b5 is a better action. Note that a\u00b5 are sampled for each batch, and thus m(s, a\u00b5) are calculated over every training batch. Line 15 in Algorithm 1 shows the process of calculating the relative transition quality. We argue that the above Equations (13) and (14) is only a simple and effective way to be the replacement of the optimal Q-function, and it can serve as a baseline for future algorithms. We believe that many other methods, including the \"upper envelope\" in BAIL [22] and uncertainty estimation in [61], also have the potential to be incorporated in ACL-QL.\nSuppose we present the functions \\omega_{\\mu},w_{\\pi_{\\beta}} as deep neural networks, the key point is how to design the loss functions."}, {"title": "VI. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "In ACL-QL, we represent two adaptive weight functions \\omega_\\mu(s, a) and w_{\\pi_\\beta}(s, a) by one neural network, which has the same network architecture as the Q-function but the output dimension is 2. During each gradient descent step, we train the adaptive weight network, the Q networks, and the policy networks in turn. We list all the hyperparameters and network architectures of ACL-QL in Table I.\nWe conducted all the experiments on the commonly-used offline RL benchmark D4RL [70], which includes many task domains [71]\u2013[73] and a variety of dataset types. The evaluation criterion is the normalized average accumulated rewards ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the average returns of a policy taking random action at each step, and 100 represents the average returns of a domain-specific expert. Aiming to provide a comprehensive comparison, we compared ACL-QL to many state-of-the-art model-free algorithms including Behavioral Cloning (BC) [74], Behavioral Cloning with best 10% trajectories (10% BC) [74], offline version of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC-Off) [29], Bootstrapping Error Accumulation Reduction (BEAR) [12], Behavior Regularized Actor-Critic (BRAC) [15], Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) [50], Batch-Constrained deep Q-learning (BCQ) [17], Algorithm for policy gradient from arbitrary experience via DICE (aDICE) [48], Decision Transformer (DT) [56], Advantage Weighted Actor-Critic (AWAC) [49], Onestep RL [54], TD3+BC [46], Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) [41], Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) [18], Guided Offline RL (GORL) [58], Monotonic Quantile network with Conservative Quantile Regression (MQN-CQR) [42] and Mild Offline AC (MOAC) [43]. For the sake of fair comparisons, we directly reported the results of all baselines from the D4RL whitepaper [70] and their original papers. To be consistent with previous works, we trained ACL-QL for 1.0 M gradient steps and evaluated for 10 episodes every 1000 training iterations. The results are the average accumulated reward of 10 episodes over 6 random seeds [75] and are obtained from the workflow proposed by [76]. More specifically, we use the offline policy evaluation method in [76], which calculates the average Q-value of all states in the dataset and the corresponding predicted actions to choose the model checkpoint. We select the model with the highest average Q-value as the final model. The basic idea here is that the goal of the learned policy is to maximize the accumulative discounted return over all states, which include the states in the dataset. Once the policy can achieve high Q-values over all states in the dataset, the current policy is a good one to a certain extent. Note that to reflect better the fact that ACL-QL can adaptively learn good strategies for various datasets, we use the same set of hyperparameters for all tasks on the same environment, as opposed to other baseline algorithms that adjust hyperparameters individually for each task to obtain optimal performances. This greatly reduces the extent to which the prior knowledge of the dataset is required and reduces the difficulty and cost for deployment.\nGym-MuJoCo Tasks. We evaluate ACL-QL over the Gym-MuJoCo tasks, including \"halfcheetah\", \"hopper\" and \"walker\" with 4 kinds of dataset types, ranging from medium-expert mixed data to random data. For brevity, we marked \"-medium-expert\", \"-medium-replay\", \"-medium\" and \"random\" as \"-m-e\", \"-m-r\", \"-m\" and \"-r\" respectively. We use \u03b1 = 10 for \"halfcheetah\" and \"walker\" environments and \u03b1 = 20 for \"hopper\" environments. Table II shows the normalized average accumulated rewards of 12 Gym-MuJoCo version-2 tasks over 6 random seeds. We can observe that ACL-QL consistently outperforms other baselines for the sum results on HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker environments by a large margin, like achieving normalized returns 337.9 for Hopper-sum compared to 268.2 from CQL [18]. From the perspective of the dataset types, ACL-QL is a very balanced algorithm that achieves excelling results on all kinds of datasets with expert, medium, and random data. For instance, with the same hyperparameters, on Hopper-medium-expert, ACL-QL achieves a comparable high performance of 107.2, while also gaining the best result of 33.5 on Hopper-random. In contrast, though MQN-CQR delivers relatively higher returns on datasets with better quality, such as 113.0 on Hopper-medium-expert, it can only have lower returns on random datasets like 13.2 on Hopper-random.\nAdroit Tasks. The adroit tasks [73] are high-dimensional robotic manipulation tasks with sparse reward, including \"door\", \"hammer\", and \"pen\". Each task includes expert data and human demonstrations from narrow distributions and contains 3 types, i.e., \"-cloned\", \"-expert\", and \"-human\". We use \u03b1 = 1 for \"pen\", \u03b1 = 10 for \"hammer\", and \u03b1 = 20"}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we proposed a flexible framework named Adaptive Conservative Level in Q-Learning (ACL-QL), which sheds light on how to control the conservative level of the Q-function in a fine-grained way.

We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of how the conservative level of the learned Q-function changes under different conditions and define the monotonicity of the adaptive weight functions. To illustrate the feasibility of our framework, we propose a novel practical algorithm ACL-QL using neural networks as the weight functions. With the guidance of the theoretical analysis, we construct two surrogate and monotonicity losses to control the conservative level and maintain the monotonicity. We build extensive experiments on commonly-used offline RL benchmarks and the state-of-the-art results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Accurate seamless positioning is paramount in the era of ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling critical applications such as navigation, asset tracking, and location-based services [1]\u2013[3]. The proliferation of IoT devices has exponentially increased the demand for precise and reliable positioning systems. Researchers have explored various indoor positioning techniques, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons [4], Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging [5], and inertial sensor-based dead reckoning [6]. Each method presents unique strengths and limitations regarding accuracy, coverage, scalability, and cost.\nBLE beacons provide a cost-effective solution with reasonable accuracy but require dense deployment for high precision [4]. UWB offers high accuracy and low latency, suitable for applications needing precise location information, such as industrial asset tracking [5], but is generally more expensive and has a limited range compared to BLE-based systems. Inertial sensor-based dead reckoning relies on accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers to estimate position changes but suffers from cumulative errors over time, necessitating periodic calibration with other positioning methods [6].\nFusing multiple positioning technologies has become a promising approach to enhance performance and robustness, especially in complex urban environments [7]. Sensor fusion leverages the complementary strengths of different technologies to provide a more accurate and reliable positioning solution. For instance, combining BLE beacon data with inertial sensor data can compensate for the weaknesses of each method, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness.\nHowever, integrating diverse positioning sensors poses significant challenges due to heterogeneous data formats and the need for sophisticated algorithms to handle uncertainties, noise, and interdependencies among different data sources [8]. Traditional sensor fusion systems often rely on manual feature engineering and domain expertise, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new sensor types and environments [9].\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4-0613, offer promising solutions for the standardization of heterogeneous sensor data. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, inspiring researchers to explore their potential in other domains. Leveraging LLMs for automated data standardization can significantly reduce manual intervention and enhance scalability."}, {"title": "A.

FEASIBILITY STUDY OVERVIEW", "content": "The flowchart of the proposed feasibility study, depicted in Fig. 1, illustrates the iterative standardization and validation process essential for enhancing seamless positioning systems. The study begins with collecting unstandardized sensor data from sources like smartphones, IoT devices, and UWB tags. This heterogeneous data is processed by the Intelligent Data Standardization Module (IDSM), leveraging a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to automate standardization. The IDSM segments incoming data by sensor type and normalizes complex elements (e.g., timestamps to UNIX nanoseconds). The standardized data is formatted according to predefined specifications, as shown in Table I.\nUnit tests ensure the accuracy and integrity of the standardized data before progressing. Following standardization, the Transformation Rule Generation Module (TRGM) creates transformation rules, generating scripts for new sensor data standardization, enhancing scalability. The scripts undergo unit testing for functionality and reliability.\nFinally, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) integrates standardized data from multiple sensors, improving the system's precision and robustness. Covariance matrices represent uncertainties, which are manually specified but may require adaptive approaches for real-world scenarios."}, {"title": "III.

The error was measured by calculating the shortest distance between our solution and the ground truth path. The results are presented in Table VII and visualized in Fig. 5.\nTable VII and Fig. 5 demonstrate the benefits of integrating multiple positioning technologies. The standalone GNSS system shows a mean error of 25.02 meters, revealing significant deviations due to urban multipath effects. Integrating GNSS with an IMU reduces the mean error to 23.24 meters, but errors remain substantial. The UWB system shows improved performance indoors, with a mean error of 0.79 meters, further reduced to 0.69 meters when combined with an IMU. The Visual Positioning System (VPS) shows exceptional accuracy in outdoor settings, with a mean error of 0.32 meters. When integrated with an IMU, VPS maintains high accuracy with a mean error of 0.33 meters. Combining GNSS, VPS, UWB, and IMU leverages the strengths of each technology, providing reliable and accurate real-time positioning in urban settings. The GNSS + VPS + UWB + IMU combination achieves a mean error of 0.33 meters, demonstrating the effectiveness of this integrated approach.\nFig. 6 illustrates the dynamic performance of each method. The UWB error fluctuates initially but stabilizes to a lower range. VPS and VPS + IMU methods exhibit consistently low errors, highlighting their robustness. The UWB + IMU combination shows a notable reduction in error compared to standalone UWB. The integrated GNSS + UWB + VPS + IMU approach maintains a consistently low error rate, validating the effectiveness of combining these technologies for optimal positioning accuracy. Note that GNSS and GNSS + IMU data are omitted from Fig. 6 due to their high error values, which would obscure the visualization of other data."}, {"title": "IX. CONCLUSION", "content": "The study highlights the efficacy of the proposed feasibility study for real-time automated data standardization using large language models, particularly in enhancing seamless positioning. The Intelligent Data Standardization Module (IDSM) achieved near-zero loss and full accuracy in both training and validation phases, demonstrating robust learning capabilities and reliable data standardization across diverse sensor inputs. The Transformation Rules Generation Module (TRGM) significantly reduced the manual effort required for script generation, enhancing productivity and minimizing human intervention. In terms of positioning accuracy, the data fusion approach outperformed traditional standalone methods, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.35 meters and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.25 meters. This improvement is critical for applications necessitating precise and reliable location data. The synergy of IDSM's high accuracy and TRGM's automation capabilities presents a powerful solution for sensor data processing, leading to more reliable data and improved decision-making. Despite promising results, the reliance on predefined schemas and manually specified covariance matrices may limit system adaptability in dynamic environments. Additionally, the controlled evaluation setting may not fully capture real-world complexities. Future research should refine this approach for dynamic and complex environmental adaptation and integrate emerging technologies for robustness. Investigate models beyond GPT-4-0613 to understand performance variations, study computational costs and assess real-time versus offline operations."}]}

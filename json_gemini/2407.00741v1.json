Safe Reinforcement Learning\nSafe reinforcement learning (RL) in constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) aims to maximize cumulative rewards while ensuring safety constraints. Garca and Fernndez (2015) categorize safe RL methods into Reward Shaping, Policy Constraints, Model-Based Approaches, Lyapunov-Based Methods, and Barrier Functions. Reward Shaping modifies rewards to penalize unsafe actions, while Policy Constraints, like Achiam et al.'s (2017) Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), explicitly incorporate safety constraints into policy optimization. Model-Based Approaches, such as Fisac et al. (2018), combine model predictive control with RL for safety guarantees. Lyapunov-Based Methods use Lyapunov functions to maintain stability, as proposed by Chow et al. (2018). Barrier Functions, like Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) used by Ames et al. (2017), ensure the state remains within a safe set. Extending safe RL to multi-agent settings introduces additional challenges due to the need for coordination and communication among agents. Stooke et al. (2020) introduce PID Lagrangian Methods, which dynamically enforce safety constraints using PID controllers. Yang et al. (2022) propose a constrained update projection approach to maintain safety in multi-agent settings, even with communication delays. Zhang et al. (2021) suggest decentralized safety mechanisms that rely on local observations and communication without a central coordinator. Li et al. (2021) introduce graph-based methods for safe multi-agent RL, modeling agent interactions as a graph to ensure scalable and efficient coordination while satisfying safety constraints.\nB. Multi-Agent Safe Reinforcement Learning\nExtending safe RL to multi-agent settings introduces additional challenges due to the need for coordination and communication among agents. To address these challenges, several approaches have been proposed. Stooke et al. (2020) introduce PID Lagrangian methods for responsive safety in multi-agent RL, utilizing proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to dynamically enforce safety constraints, which is effective in scenarios requiring quick responses to changing safety conditions. Yang et al. (2022) propose a constrained update projection approach for safe policy optimization in multi-agent settings, where policy updates are projected onto a feasible set that satisfies safety constraints, proving effective in scenarios with communication delays and failures. Recognizing the infeasibility of fully connected communication networks in many real-world applications, Zhang et al. (2021) propose a decentralized safe RL framework that leverages local observations and communication to ensure safety without relying on a central coordinator. Additionally, Li et al. (2021) introduce graph-based methods for safe multi-agent RL, modeling agent interactions as a graph, which allows for scalable and efficient coordination among agents while ensuring safety constraints are satisfied. These diverse approaches collectively address the complexities of multi-agent coordination and communication in safety-critical environments.\nC. Diffusion Models in Reinforcement Learning\nDiffusion models have recently gained attention for their ability to generate realistic data samples, enhancing decision-"}, {"title": "III. MATH", "content": "A. Preliminaries\n1) Control Barrier Functions with Diffusion Models: For a nonlinear affine control system:\n$\\dot{s}(t) = f(s(t), a(t)),$ (1)\nwhere $s \\in S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the system state, and $a \\in A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the admissible control input.\nDefinition 1 A set $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is forward invariant for system (1) if the solutions for some $a \\in A$ beginning at any $s_{0} \\in C$ meet $x_{t} \\in C, \\forall t \\geq 0$.\nDefinition 2 A function $h$ is a control barrier function (CBF) if there exists an extended class $\\mathcal{K}_{\\infty}$ function $\\alpha$, i.e., $\\alpha$ is strictly increasing and satisfies $\\alpha(0) = 0$, such that for the control system (1):\n$\\sup_{\\alpha \\in A} [\\nabla h(s) \\cdot f(s, a)] \\geq -\\alpha(h(s)),$ (2)\nfor all $s \\in C$.\nTheorem 1.(Ames et al. (2017)) Given a CBF h(s) from Definition 2, if $s_{0} \\in C$, then any a generated by a Lipschitz continuous controller that satisfies the constraint in (2), $\\forall t \\geq 0$ renders C forward invariant for system (1).\nIn single-agent reinforcement learning, for a control policy $\\pi: S \\rightarrow A$, CBF h, state space $s \\in S$, action space $a \\in A$ and let $S_{aS}$ be the dangerous set, $S_{S} = S \\backslash S_{aS}$ be the safe set, which contains the set of initial conditions $S_{0} \\subset S_{S}$. It is proved in (Ames et al., 2014) that if these three conditions:\n$(\\forall s \\in S_{0}, h(s) > 0) \\land (\\forall s \\in S_{aS}, h(s) < 0)$ (3)\n$\\land (\\forall s \\in \\{s | h(s) \\geq 0\\}, \\nabla_{s}h \\cdot f(s, a) + \\alpha(h) \\geq 0)$,\nare satisfied with $a = \\pi(s)$, then $s(t) \\in \\{s|h(s) > 0\\}$ for $\\forall t \\in [0,\\infty)$, which means the state is forward invariant according to Theorem 1, and it would never enter the dangerous set $S_{aS}$ under $\\pi$.\nDiffusion Models generate data from the dataset $\\mathbb{D} := \\{X_{i}\\}_{0<i<M}$. The forward diffusion process is defined as: $q(x_{k+1}|x_{k}) := \\mathcal{N}(x_{k+1}; \\sqrt{\\alpha_{k}}x_{k}, (1 - \\alpha_{k})I)$ and the reverse diffusion process is $p_{\\theta}(x_{k-1}|x_{k}) := \\mathcal{N}(x_{k-1}|\\mu_{\\theta}(x_{k}, k), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_{k},k))$, where $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ is a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\Sigma$. Here, $\\alpha$ is known as the diffusion rate and is precalculated using a variance scheduler. The term I is an identity matrix. By predicting the parameters for the reverse diffusion process at each time step with a neural network, new samples that closely match the underlying data distribution are generated. The reverse diffusion process can be estimated by the loss function as follows (Ho et al., 2020):\n$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{k \\sim [1, K], z_{0} \\sim q, \\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)}[||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, k) ||^{2}].$ (4)\nThe predicted noise $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k},k)$ is to estimate the noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$.\nIn the forward process, we use classifier-free guidance, which requires an additional condition $y$ to generate target synthetic data. In this work, we incorporated CBF into the diffusion model for the finite-time forward invariance and reward for the optimal policy. Classifier-free guidance modifies the original training setup to learn both a conditional $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, y,k)$ and an unconditional conditional noise $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, \\O, k)$ where a dummy value ($\\O$ takes the place of y. The perturbed noise $\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, \\O, k) + \\omega(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, y, k) - \\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_{k}, \\O, k))$ is used to later generate samples.\nAbout diffusion decision-making in single-agent settings, diffusing over state trajectories only (Ajay et al., 2023), is claimed to be easier to model and can obtain better performance due to the less smooth nature of action sequences:\n$\\uparrow := [\\hat{S}_{t}, \\hat{S}_{t+1},..., \\hat{S}_{t+H-1}],$ (5)\nwhere H is the trajectory length that the diffusion model generates and t is the time a state was visited in trajectory"}, {"title": "MATH", "content": "T. However, sampling states from the diffusion model cannot get the corresponding action. To infer the policy, we could use the inverse dynamics model to generate the action by two consecutive states in the trajectory:\n$\\hat{a}_{t} = I(S_{t}, \\hat{S}_{t+1}).$ (6)\n2) Multi-agent Offline Reinforcement Learning with Safety Constraints: The safe MARL problem is normally formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) $\\{N, S, O, A, p, p^{0}, \\gamma, R, h\\}$. Here, $N = \\{1,..., n\\}$ is the set of agents, the joint state space is $S = \\{S_{1}, S_{2}, ..., S_{n}\\}$ where $s^{t}_{i} \\in S_{i}$ denotes the state of agent i at time step t, O is the local observation, $A = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} A_{i}$ is the joint action space, $p:S \\times A \\rightarrow S$ is the probabilistic transition function, $p^{0}$ is the initial state distribution, $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is the discount factor, $R:S \\times A \\times S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is the joint reward function, h : S \u2192 R is the constraint function; in this paper, we use CBF as the constraint function. At time step t, the joint state at time t is denoted by $s_{t} = \\{s^{t}_{1},...,s^{t}_{n}\\}$, and every agent i takes action $a^{t}_{i}$ according to its policy $\\pi^{i}(a|s_{t})$. Together with other agents' actions, it gives a joint action $a_{t} = (a^{t}_{1},...,a^{t}_{n})$ and the joint policy $\\pi(a_{t}|s_{t}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\pi^{i}(a^{i}_{t}|s_{t})$. In offline settings, instead of collecting online data in environments, we only have access to a static dataset D to learn the policies. The dataset D generally comprises trajectories T, i.e., observation-action sequences.\nFor each agent i, we define $N_{i}$ as the set of its neighborhood agents at time t. Let $o^{t}_{i} \\in O_{i}$ be the local observation of agent i, which is the states of $N_{i}$ neighborhood agents. Notice that the dimension of $o^{t}_{i}$ is not fixed and depends on the quantity of neighboring agents.\nWe assume the safety of agent i is jointly determined by $S_{i}$ and $o_{i}$. Let $O_{i}$ be the set of all observations and $X_{i} := S_{i} \\times O_{i}$ be the state-observation space that contains the safe set $X_{i,s}$, dangerous set $X_{i,d}$, and initial conditions $X_{i,0} \\subset X_{i,s}$. Let d describe the minimum distance from agent i to other agents, relative speed V, deceleration b, and minimal stopped gap $K_{s}$, then $d(s_{i}, O_{i}) < \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}$, implies a collision. Then $X_{i,s} = \\{(s_{i}, O_{i}) | d(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}\\}$ and $X_{i,d} = \\{(s_{i}, O_{i}) | d(s_{i}, O_{i}) < \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}\\}$. Since there is a surjection from S to $X_{i}$, we may define $d_{i}$ as the lifting of d from $X_{i}$ to S. $S_{s} := \\{s \\in S| \\forall i = 1,...,N, d_{i}(s) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}\\}$ is then defined. Formally speaking, a multi-agent system's safety can be described as follows:\nDefinition 3 If the minimum distance satisfies $d(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}$ for agent i and t, then agent i is safe at time t. If for $\\forall i$, agent i is safe at time t, then the multi-agent system is safe at time t, and $s \\in S.\nB. Methodology\n1) Framework for Control Barrier Function in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: A simple CBF for a multi-agent dynamic system is a centralized function that accounts for the joint states of all agents. However, it may cause an exponential explosion in the state space; it is also difficult to define a safety constraint for the entire system while ensuring that the security of individual agents will not be violated."}, {"title": "MATH", "content": "By Definition 3, we consider decentralized CBF to guarantee the multi-agent system's safety. From equation (3), we propose the following CBF:\n$(\\forall (s_{i}, O_{i}) \\in X_{i,0}, h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0)$ (7)\n$((s_{i}, O_{i}) \\in X_{i,d}, h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) < 0)$\n$((s_{i}, O_{i}) \\in \\{(s_{i}, O_{i}) | h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0\\},\\nabla_{s_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot f_{i}(s_{i}, a_{i}) + \\nabla_{o_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot \\dot{o_{i}}(t) + \\alpha(h_{i}) \\geq 0)$\nwhere $\\dot{o_{i}}(t)$ denotes the time derivative of observation, which depends on other agents' actions. It can be assessed and included in the training process without an explicit expression. Here, the state $s_{i}$ and $o_{i}$ are the local state and observation of the corresponding agent i. We refer to conditions (3) as the decentralized CBF for agent i.\nProposition 1 If the decentralized CBF conditions in (7) are satisfied, then $\\forall t$ and $\\forall i, (s_{i}, o_{i}) \\in \\{(s_{i}, O_{i}) | h_{i}(S_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0\\}$, which implies the state would never enter $X_{i,d}$ for any agent i. Thus, the multi-agent system is safe by Definition (3).\nAccording to Proposition 1, CBF can be a decentralized paradigm for every agent in the entire multi-agent system. Since state-observation satisfying $h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0$ is forward invariant, agent i never gets closer than $\\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}$ to all of its neighboring agents. According to the definition of $h_{i}, h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) > 0 \\Rightarrow d_{i}(s) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}$. The multi-agent system is safe according to Definition 3 since $\\forall i, h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0$ implies that $d_{i}, d_{i}(s) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2.b} + K_{s}$.\nNext, we need to formulate the control barrier function $h_{i}(s_{i}, o_{i})$ to get a safe set from dataset D. Let $\\mathbb{T}_{i} = \\{S_{i}, O_{i}\\}$ be a trajectory of the state and observation of agent i. Let $\\mathbb{T}$ be the set of all possible trajectories of agent i. Let $H_{i}$ and $V_{i}$ be the function classes of $h_{i}$ and policy $\\pi_{i}$. Define the function $\\gamma_{i}: \\mathbb{T}_{i} \\times H_{i} \\times V_{i} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ as:\n$\\gamma_{i}(\\mathbb{T}_{i}, h_{i}, \\pi_{i}) := \\min \\{\\inf_{X_{i,s} \\cap \\mathbb{T}_{i}} h_{i}(S_{i}, O_{i}), \\inf_{X_{i,d} \\cap \\mathbb{T}_{i}} -h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}), \\inf_{\\mathbb{X}_{i,h} \\cap \\mathbb{T}_{i}} (\\dot{h_{i}} + \\alpha(h_{i}))\\}.$ (8)\nNotice that the third item on the right side of Equation (8) depends on both the policy and CBF, since $\\dot{h_{i}} = \\nabla_{s_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot f_{i}(s_{i}, U_{i}) + \\nabla_{o_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot \\dot{O_{i}}(t), U_{i} = \\pi_{i}(S_{i}, O_{i})$. It is clear that if we can find $h_{i}$ and $\\pi_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i})$ such that $\\gamma_{i}(\\mathbb{T}_{i}, h_{i}, \\pi_{i}) > 0$ for $\\forall \\mathbb{T}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{T}_{i}$ and $\\forall i$, then the conditions in (7) are satisfied. We solve the objective:\nFor all i, find $h_{i} \\in H_{i}$ and $\\pi_{i} \\in V_{i}$, such that $\\gamma_{i}(\\mathbb{T}_{i}, h_{i}, \\pi_{i}) \\geq \\gamma$, where $\\gamma > 0$ is a margin for the satisfaction of the CBF condition in (7).\n2) Diffusion Model with Guidance: We formulate the diffusion model as follows:\n$\\max_{\\theta} \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\mathbb{D}} [log p_{\\theta}(\\tau|y(\\cdot))],$ (9)\nOur goal is to estimate $\\tau$ conditioned on $y(\\cdot)$ with $p_{\\theta}$. In this paper, $y(t)$ includes the CBF and the reward under the trajectory.\nGiven an offline dataset D that consists of all agents' trajectories data, our diffusion model also takes a decentralized"}, {"title": "MATH", "content": "manner to make it consistent with the decentralized CBF. The model is parameterized through the unified noise model $\\epsilon$ and the inverse dynamics model I of each agent i with the reverse diffusion loss and the inverse dynamics loss:\n$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\phi) := \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau_{O} \\in \\mathbb{D}, \\beta \\sim Bern(p)} [||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\theta} (\\tau, (1 - \\beta)y^{i}(\\tau_{O}) + \\beta\\O, k) ||^{2}]\n+ \\sum_{i}\\sum_{t}\\mathbb{E}_{(S^{t}_{i}, O^{t}_{i}, a^{t}_{i}) \\in \\mathbb{D}} [||a^{t}_{i} - I ((S^{t}_{i}, O^{t}_{i}), (S^{t+1}_{i}, O^{t+1}_{i})) ||^{2}].$ (10)\n3) Implementation Details: However, there are some other gaps between methodology and practical implementation. First, equation (8) does not provide an exact way of designing loss functions. Second, the CBF and $\\pi$ are coupled, where minor approximation errors can bootstrap across them and lead to severe instability; furthermore, $h_{i}$ has term $O_{i}$. Third, we do not have the loss function considering reward maximization.\nBased on equation (8), we formulate the loss function: $\\mathcal{L} = \\sum \\mathcal{L}_{i}$, where $\\mathcal{L}_{i}$ is the loss function for agent i:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\phi_{i}) = \\sum_{S_{i} \\in X_{i,0}} max (0, \\gamma - h^{i}(S_{i}, O_{i}))\n+\\sum_{S_{i} \\in X_{i,d}} max (0, \\gamma + h^{i}(S_{i}, O_{i}) \\dagger)\n+ \\sum_{(S_{i},a_{i}) \\in X_{i,h}} max \\{0, -(\\nabla_{s_{i}}h^{i} \\cdot f_{i}(s_{i}, a_{i})\n-\\nabla_{o_{i}}h^{i} \\cdot \\dot{O_{i}} - \\alpha(h^{i})\\} (11)\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the margin of satisfaction of CBF. We need to evaluate $\\dot{O_{i}}$, which is the time derivative of the observation. Instead, we approximate $\\dot{h_{i}(s_{i}, o_{i})} = \\nabla_{s_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot f_{i}(S_{i}, a_{i}) + \\nabla_{o_{i}}h_{i} \\cdot \\dot{O_{i}}$ with the forward difference method $\\hat{h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i})} = [h_{i}(S_{i}(t + \\Delta t), O_{i}(t + \\Delta t)) - h_{i}(S_{i}(t), O_{i}(t))] / \\Delta t$. So, we only need $S_{i}$ and $o_{i}$ from the dataset, then the loss function becomes:\n$\\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\theta_{i}) = \\sum_{S_{i} \\in X_{i,0}} max (0, \\gamma - h^{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}))\n+\\sum_{S_{i} \\in X_{i,d}} max (0, \\gamma + h^{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}))\n+\\sum_{(S_{i},a_{i}) \\in X_{i,h}} max \\{0, -(\\gamma - (\\frac{\\Delta h_{i}}{\\Delta t} - \\alpha(h_{i}(S_{i}, O_{i}))))\\} (12)\nwhere $\\Delta h_{i} = h_{i}(s_{i}(t + \\Delta t), o_{i}(t + \\Delta t)) - h_{i}(s_{i}(t), o_{i}(t))$.\nFor the class-$\\mathcal{K}$ function $\\alpha(\\cdot)$, we simply choose a linear function. Note here that $\\mathcal{L}$ only proposes safety constraints. We incorporate the safety reward into its reward and denote this safe version. The safety reward is $r_{p}$ when the agent"}, {"title": "MATH", "content": "enters the dangerous set.\n$\\mathbb{R}^{i} = \\mathbb{E} [\\sum_{t=1}^{H} \\gamma (r^{it} - r_{p})]$ (13)\nWe propose the objective function:\n$\\max_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}_{s} [\\mathbb{V}^{\\pi} (s). 1_{s \\in X_{i,h}}],$ (14)\nInspired by IQL, we do not explicitly learn the policy by a separate value function that approximates an expectile only concerning the action distribution:\n$\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathbb{V}} = \\mathbb{E}_{(s_{i},a_{i}) \\in X_{i,h}} [\\mathbb{L}_{\\tau} (Q_{i}(s_{i}, a_{i}) - \\mathbb{V}^{i}(s_{i}))],$ (15)\n$\\mathcal{L}^{Q^{i}} = \\mathbb{E}_{(s_{i},a_{i},r_{i}) \\in X_{i,h}} [(r_{i} + \\mathbb{V}^{i} (s_{i+1})\n-Q^{i} (s_{i}, a_{i}))^{2}].$ (16)"}, {"title": "IV.

Let $\\mathbb{D} = \\{x_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ represent the dataset. The forward diffusion process is defined as:\n$q(x_{k+1}|x_{k}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{\\alpha_{k}}x_{k}, (1 - \\alpha_{k})I),$ (17)\nwhere $\\alpha_{k}$ is the diffusion rate and I is the identity matrix.

Reward Maximization Loss\nThe reward maximization loss aims to optimize expected rewards while adhering to safety constraints. It utilizes an inverse dynamics model to generate actions from predicted state trajectories. The expected reward is given by:\n$\\mathbb{E} [\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\gamma r_{t} ],$ (25)\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the discount factor."}, {"title": "MATH", "content": "C. Combined Loss\nThe total loss combines the CBF loss and the reward maximization loss, including a margin of satisfaction to ensure robust adherence to safety constraints.\nThe combined loss function is:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{CBF} + \\Lambda \\mathbb{E} [\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\gamma r_{t} ],$ (26)\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is a weighting factor that balances safety and reward optimization.\nD. Comparative Analysis and Results\nWe compare the proposed model against several baseline algorithms: (1) PID Lagrangian Methods (Stooke et al., 2020), which use Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) methods to enforce safety constraints in reinforcement learning; (2) Constrained Policy Optimization (Yang et al., 2022), which focuses on optimizing policies under safety constraints using projection methods; (3) Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each agent learns its Q-function independently; and (4) Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG), which extends DDPG to multi-agent settings, allowing for coordination among agents.\n1) Performance Metrics Table: The table III below compares the performance metrics of the proposed model with baseline algorithms, including average cumulative reward, standard deviation, safety state percentage, violation frequency, and violation severity.\nAnalysis:\n\u2022 The proposed model achieves the highest average cumulative reward (850) and the lowest standard deviation (30), indicating both high performance and consistency.\n\u2022 It maintains the highest safety state percentage (95%) with the lowest violation frequency (5) and severity (0.1), demonstrating superior adherence to safety constraints compared to the baseline algorithms.\n2) Generalization Performance Across Unseen Environments: This table I presents the performance of the algorithms across three unseen environments, along with the average generalization score. The evaluation of generalization performance is crucial to understand how well the model can adapt to new, unseen scenarios, which is a key aspect in real-world applications where agents encounter dynamic and unpredictable environments.\nAnalysis:\n\u2022 The proposed model consistently performs well across all unseen environments, achieving the highest average generalization score (G = 810), indicating robust generalization capabilities. This high score reflects the model's ability to maintain its performance even when faced with scenarios it was not explicitly trained on. Such robustness is essential for deploying reinforcement learning models in practical settings, where variability and unforeseen circumstances are the norms. Formally, let $E_{train}$ and $E_{test}$ be the training and test environments respectively. The model's performance is given by $E_{test} [R(\\pi^{*})]$ where $\\pi^{*}$ is the optimal policy derived from $E_{train}$.\n\u2022 Additionally, the consistent performance across multiple unseen environments demonstrates the effectiveness of the diffusion model and control barrier functions (CBFs) in providing a stable and adaptive learning framework. This suggests that the proposed approach not only learns optimal policies but also retains flexibility and resilience, which are critical for long-term deployment and operational safety. Mathematically, let h(s, a) denote the safety function and R(s, a) the rewardHere is the rest of the parsed JSON:\n\n```json\nfunction. The model optimizes $\\mathbb{E} [\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\gamma R(s_{t}, a_{t})]$ subject to $h(s_{t}, a_{t}) \\geq 0 \\forall t \\in [0, T]$.\n\u2022 The strong generalization performance of the proposed model can also be attributed to its decentralized architecture, which allows each agent to operate based on local observations while still benefiting from centralized training. This balance between centralized policy learning and decentralized execution enables the model to effectively coordinate multi-agent actions without compromising on adaptability and responsiveness to local changes in the environment. Formally, let $\\pi_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i})$ be the policy of agent i based on its state $s_{i}$ and local observation $O_{i}$. The joint policy $\\pi(S) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} \\pi_{i}(S_{i}, O_{i})$ is optimized in a decentralized manner, ensuring that $P[h_{i}(s_{i}, O_{i}) \\geq 0] \\geq \\beta$ for each agent i, where $\\beta$ is a predefined safety threshold.\n3) Hyperparameter Tuning Results: The following table II shows the hyperparameter tuning results for each algorithm, including hyperparameter values, validation rewards, and validation safety percentages. Hyperparameter tuning is an essential process in training reinforcement learning models, as it involves finding the optimal set of parameters that maximize performance while ensuring safety constraints are met."}, {"title": "E. Average Speed Evaluation", "content": "Analysis:\n\u2022 The proposed model achieves the highest validation reward ($\\mathbb{E}[R] = 850$) and safety percentage ($P[safe] = 0.95$) with optimal hyperparameter settings. This demonstrates the hyperparameter tuning process's efficacy, as the chosen parameters effectively balance the trade-offs between reward maximization and adherence to safety constraints. This balance is crucial for real-world applications where both performance and safety are paramount.\n\u2022 The high validation reward indicates the proposed model's proficiency in learning policies that yield substantial returns. This is particularly significant in applications where maximizing rewards leads to superior outcomes, such as enhanced efficiency in autonomous driving (n) or improved performance in robotic tasks (p). Formally, if R(t) denotes the reward at time t, the model maximizes $\\mathbb{E} [\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\gamma R(t)]$, where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor.\n\u2022 Furthermore, the 95% safety percentage underscores the model's consistent adherence to safety constraints, thereby minimizing the risk of unsafe actions. This high safety adherence is critical for deploying reinforcement learning models in safety-critical environments, ensuring that the agents' actions do not compromise operational integrity or lead to catastrophic failures. Mathematically, if h(s) represents the safety constraint function, the model ensures $P[h(s_{t}) \\geq 0 \\forall t \\in [0, T]] = 0.95$.\n\u2022 The effectiveness of the hyperparameter tuning process also reflects the robustness of the proposed framework. By systematically exploring the parameter space $\\Theta$ and optimizing the model settings, the framework ensures that the agents are well-prepared to handle a variety of scenarios while maintaining high performance and safety standards. Let $\\theta^{*}$ be the optimal set of hyperparameters, then $\\theta^{*} = arg\\underset{\\theta \\in \\Theta}{max} \\mathbb{E}[R(\\theta)]$ subject to $P[h(s; \\theta) \\geq 0] > 0.95$.\nOverall, the successful hyperparameter tuning and resulting high performance metrics reinforce the potential of the proposed model as a reliable and efficient solution for multi-agent reinforcement learning in complex, real-world environments. This process not only fine-tunes the model but also enhances its generalization capabilities and operational safety, making it a strong candidate for deployment in diverse applications. Formally, the objective can be expressed as a multi-objective optimization problem: $max_{\\pi,\\theta} \\mathbb{E}[R(\\pi, \\theta)]$ s.t. $P[h(s_{t}) \\geq 0] \\geq 0.95 \\forall t$, where $\\pi$ denotes the policy and $\\theta$ represents the hyperparameters."}, {"title": "VI.

LIMITATION", "content": "While our framework integrating diffusion models and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) shows significant advancements in ensuring safety and performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), several limitations must be acknowledged. The computational complexity can be substantial, especially in high-dimensional environments with many agents, leading to increased training times and resource requirements. Approximation errors in CBF constraints may affect stability, particularly in dynamic environments. The current implementation assumes minimal communication delays, which may not hold in real-world applications like autonomous driving. The framework also relies heavily on the quality of offline datasets, risking poor generalization in unobserved situations. Finally, our evaluation is limited to benchmark scenarios, and real-world environments may present unforeseen challenges. Addressing these limitations through optimized computational methods, robust communication protocols, and diverse datasets will be critical for practical applicability."}]}

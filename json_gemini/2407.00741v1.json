It is proved in (Ames et al., 2014) that if these three conditions:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\n(\\forall s \\in S_0, h(s) > 0) \\land (\\forall s \\in S_{aS}, h(s) < 0) \\\\\n\\land (\\forall s \\in \\{s \\mid h(s) \\geq 0\\}, \\nabla_s h \\cdot f(s, a) + \\alpha(h) \\geq 0),\n\\end{array}$$\nare satisfied with \\(a = \\pi(s)\\), then \\(s(t) \\in \\{s|h(s) > 0\\}\\) for \\(\\forall t \\in [0,\\infty)\\), which means the state is forward invariant according to Theorem 1, and it would never enter the dangerous set \\(S_{aS}\\) under \\(\\pi\\).\nDiffusion Models generate data from the dataset \\(D := \\{X_i\\}_{0<i<M}\\). The forward diffusion process is de- fined as: \\(q(x_{k+1}|x_k) := \\mathcal{N}(x_{k+1}; \\sqrt{\\alpha_k}x_k, (1 - \\alpha_k)I)\\) and the reverse diffusion process is \\(p_{\\theta}(x_{k-1}|x_k) := \\mathcal{N}(x_{k-1}|\\mu_{\\theta}(x_k, k), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_k,k))\\), where \\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)\\) is a Gaussian distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\Sigma\\). Here, \\(\\alpha\\) is known as the diffusion rate and is precalculated using a variance scheduler. The term \\(I\\) is an identity matrix. By predicting the parameters for the reverse diffusion process at each time step with a neural network, new samples that closely match the underlying data distribution are generated. The reverse diffusion process can be estimated by the loss function as follows (Ho et al., 2020):\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_{k\\sim[1,K],x_0\\sim q,\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I)} [||\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_k, k) ||^2].$$\nThe predicted noise \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_k,k)\\) is to estimate the noise \\(\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)\\).\nIn the forward process, we use classifier-free guidance, which requires an additional condition \\(y\\) to generate target synthetic data. In this work, we incorporated CBF into the diffusion model for the finite-time forward invariance and reward for the optimal policy. Classifier-free guidance modifies the original training setup to learn both a conditional \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_k, y,k)\\) and an unconditional conditional noise \\(\\epsilon_{\\theta}(x_k, \\emptyset, k)\\) where a dummy value (\\(\\emptyset\\) takes the place of \\(y\\).

Methodology", "content": "1) Framework for Control Barrier Function in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning: A simple CBF for a multi-agent dynamic system is a centralized function that accounts for the joint states of all agents. However, it may cause an exponential explosion in the state space; it is also difficult to define a safety constraint for the entire system while ensuring that the security of individual agents will not be violated. By Definition 3, we consider decentralized CBF to guarantee the multi-agent system's safety. From equation (3), we propose the following CBF:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\n(\\forall (s_i, O_i) \\in X_{i,0}, h_i(s_i, O_i) \\geq 0) \\\\\n((s_i, O_i) \\in X_{i,d}, h_i(s_i, O_i) < 0) \\\\\n((s_i, O_i) \\in \\{(s_i, O_i) | h_i(s_i, O_i) \\geq 0\\},\\\\\n\\nabla_{s_i} h_i \\cdot f_i(s_i, a_i) + \\nabla_{o_i} h_i \\cdot \\dot{o_i}(t) + \\alpha(h_i) \\geq 0)\n\\end{array}$$\nwhere \\(\\dot{o_i}(t)\\) denotes the time derivative of observation, which depends on other agents' actions. It can be assessed and included in the training process without an explicit expression. Here, the state \\(s_i\\) and \\(o_i\\) are the local state and observation of the corresponding agent i. We refer to conditions (3) as the decentralized CBF for agent i.\nProposition 1 If the decentralized CBF conditions in (7) are satisfied, then \\(\\forall t\\) and \\(\\forall i\\), \\((s_i, o_i) \\in \\{(s_i, O_i) | h_i(s_i, O_i) \\geq 0\\}\\), which implies the state would never enter \\(X_{i,d}\\) for any agent i. Thus, the multi-agent system is safe by Definition (3).\nAccording to Proposition 1, CBF can be a decentralized paradigm for every agent in the entire multi-agent system. Since state-observation satisfying \\(h_i(s_i, O_i) \\geq 0\\) is forward invariant, agent i never gets closer than \\(\\frac{V^{2}}{2b} + \\kappa_s\\) to all of its neighboring agents. According to the definition of \\(h_i\\), \\(h_i(s_i, O_i) > 0 \\Rightarrow d_i(s) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2b} + \\kappa_s\\). The multi-agent system is safe according to Definition 3 since \\(\\forall i, h_i(s_i, O_i) \\geq 0\\) implies that \\(d_i, d_i(s) \\geq \\frac{V^{2}}{2b} + \\kappa_s\\).\nNext, we need to formulate the control barrier function \\(h_i(s_i, o_i)\\) to get a safe set from dataset \\(D\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{T}_i = \\{s_i, O_i\\}\\) be a trajectory of the state and observation of agent i. Let \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) be the set of all possible trajectories of agent i. Let \\(\\mathcal{H}_i\\) and \\(\\mathcal{V}_i\\) be the function classes of \\(h_i\\) and policy \\(\\pi_i\\). Define the function \\(\\gamma_i : \\mathcal{T}_i \\times \\mathcal{H}_i \\times \\mathcal{V}_i \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) as:\n$$\\gamma_i (\\mathcal{T}_i, h_i, \\pi_i) := \\min \\left\\{\\inf_{X_{i,s} \\cap \\mathcal{T}_i} h_i(s_i, O_i), \\inf_{X_{i,d} \\cap \\mathcal{T}_i} -h_i(s_i, O_i), \\inf_{X_{i,h} \\cap \\mathcal{T}_i} (\\dot{h_i} + \\alpha(h_i)) \\right\\}.$$\nNotice that the third item on the right side of Equation (8) depends on both the policy and CBF, since \\(\\dot{h_i} = \\nabla_{s_i}h_i \\cdot f_i(s_i, u_i) + \\nabla_{o_i}h_i \\cdot \\dot{o_i}(t)\\), \\(u_i = \\pi_i(s_i, O_i)\\). It is clear that if we can find \\(h_i\\) and \\(\\pi_i(s_i, O_i)\\) such that \\(\\gamma_i (\\mathcal{T}_i, h_i, \\pi_i) > 0\\) for \\(\\forall \\mathcal{T}_i \\in \\mathcal{T}\\) and \\(\\forall i\\), then the conditions in (7) are satisfied. We solve the objective:\nFor all i, find \\(h_i \\in \\mathcal{H}_i\\) and \\(\\pi_i \\in \\mathcal{V}_i\\), such that \\(\\gamma_i(\\mathcal{T}_i, h_i, \\pi_i) \\geq \\gamma\\), where \\(\\gamma > 0\\) is a margin for the satisfaction of the CBF condition in (7).\n2) Diffusion Model with Guidance: We formulate the diffusion model as follows:\n$$\\max_{\\theta} \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim D} [\\log p_{\\theta}(\\mathcal{T}|y(\\cdot))],$$\nOur goal is to estimate \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) conditioned on \\(y(\\cdot))\\) with \\(p_{\\theta}\\).

First, equation (8) does not provide an exact way of designing loss functions. Second, the CBF and \\(\\pi\\) are coupled, where minor approximation errors can bootstrap across them and lead to severe instability; furthermore, \\(h_i\\) has term \\(o_i\\). Third, we do not have the loss function considering reward maximization.\nBased on equation (8), we formulate the loss function: \\(\\mathcal{L} = \\sum \\mathcal{L}_i\\), where \\(\\mathcal{L}_i\\) is the loss function for agent i:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\phi_i) = \\sum_{s_i \\in X_{i,0}} \\max (0,\\gamma - h_i^\\phi(s_i, o_i)) \\\\\n+\\sum_{s_i \\in X_{i,d}} \\max (0,\\gamma + h_i^\\phi(s_i, o_i)) \\\\\n+\\sum_{(s_i, a_i) \\in X_{i,h}} \\max \\left(0, -\\nabla_{s_i} h_i^\\phi f_i(s_i, a_i) - \\nabla_{o_i} h_i^\\phi \\dot{o_i} - \\alpha (h_i^\\phi) \\right)\n\\end{array}$$\nwhere \\(\\gamma\\) is the margin of satisfaction of CBF. We need to evaluate \\(\\dot{o_i}\\), which is the time derivative of the observation. Instead, we approximate \\(\\dot{h_i(s_i, o_i)} = \\nabla_{s_i} h_i^\\phi f_i(s_i, a_i) + \\nabla_{o_i} h_i^\\phi \\dot{o_i}\\) with the forward difference method \\(\\dot{h_i(s_i, o_i)} = \\frac{h_i[(s_i(t + \\Delta t), o_i(t + \\Delta t)) - h_i(s_i(t), o_i(t))]}{\\Delta t}\\). So, we only need \\(s_i\\) and \\(o_i\\) from the dataset, then the loss function becomes:\n$$\\begin{array}{l}\n\\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\theta_i) = \\sum_{s_i \\in X_{i,0}} \\max (0,\\gamma - h_i^\\theta(s_i, O_i)) \\\\\n+\\sum_{s_i \\in X_{i,d}} \\max (0,\\gamma + h_i^\\theta(s_i, o_i)) \\\\\n+\\sum_{(s_i, a_i) \\in X_{i,h}} \\max \\left(0, -(\\gamma - \\frac{\\Delta h_i}{\\Delta t} - \\alpha (h_i (s_i, O_i))) \\right)\n\\end{array}$$\nwhere\n$$\\Delta h_i = h_i(s_i(t + \\Delta t), o_i(t + \\Delta t)) - h_i(s_i(t), o_i(t)).$$\nFor the class-K function \\(\\alpha(\\cdot)\\), we simply choose a linear function.

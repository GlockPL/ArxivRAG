{"title": "ETLNet: An Efficient TCN-BiLSTM Network for Road Anomaly Detection Using Smartphone Sensors", "authors": ["Mohd Faiz Ansari", "Rakshit Sandilya", "Mohammed Javed", "David Doermann"], "abstract": "Road anomalies can be defined as irregularities on the road surface or in the surface itself. Some may be intentional (such as speed-bumps), accidental (such as materials falling off a truck), or the result of roads' excessive use or low or no maintenance, such as potholes. Despite their varying origins, these irregularities often harm vehicles substantially. Speed bumps are intentionally placed for safety but are dangerous due to their non-standard shape, size, and lack of proper markings. Potholes are unintentional and can also cause severe damage. To address the detection of these anomalies, we need an automated road monitoring system. Today, various systems exist that use visual information to track these anomalies. Still, due to poor lighting conditions and improper or missing markings, they may go undetected and have severe consequences for public transport, automated vehicles, etc. In this paper, the Enhanced Temporal-BiLSTM Network (ETLNet) is introduced as a novel approach that integrates two Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers with a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer. This combination is tailored to detect anomalies effectively irrespective of lighting conditions, as it depends not on visuals but smartphone inertial sensor data. Our methodology employs accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, typically in smartphones, to gather data on road conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the ETLNet model maintains an Fl-score for detecting speed bumps of 99.3%. The ETLNet model's robustness and efficiency significantly advance automated road surface monitoring technologies.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Traffic accidents have become an increasingly pressing concern globally, with the deterioration of road surfaces contributing significantly to this problem.

In a broader perspective, they are divided into two types: the first is by using visuals like images, videos, etc., and the second one is the use of passive sensors like inertial sensors, for example, accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc. Works related to the approach of sensors, specifically in smartphones, are discussed as follows:\nTwo approaches are used to get the inertial sensor data: from smartphone sensors[8] or the sensors mounted on the vehicle. Aljaafreh et al. [7] proposed a speed bump detection model based on the Fuzzy Inference System. The features they used were accelerometer readings and the vehicle's speed from the smartphone. They only used the vertical component of acceleration. Their system calculates the signal variance, the first input to fuzzy logic, while the vehicle's speed is the second input. The result of the Fuzzy logic was the boolean speed bump detection. They tested their model under different vehicle speeds and concluded that the bump detection accuracy was high in the middle of the bump.\nAragon et al. [8] presented a model that could classify road anomalies, such as speed bumps, asphalt speed bumps, and potholes. The only feature they used was accelerometer readings from the smartphone. They used SVM to segment the data into anomaly and non-anomaly classes. The signal segments were classified using a Bag of Words and Random Forest representation, producing an accuracy of 75%.\nIn the work of Rishiwal et al., [3], speed bumps and potholes were detected by setting some threshold values based on the vehicle's speed. The model classifies the anomalies along with the severity level. Data were collected using a smartphone. They use only accelerometer readings for classification purposes and GPS to track the anomalies. The accuracy of the proposed approach was 93.75%.

The data preprocessing step consists of defining the input and output features, normalizing the data features, data windowing, data division for training and validation, and data class balancing [6]. In this study, we use accelerometer(X, Y, Z), gyroscope(X, Y, Z), and speed data, total seven features [6] from the dashboard location, only from the right side (as in India, the right side is the driving side) to simulate that the data is coming from smartphone sensors placed on the dashboard.

It better indicates our model's effectiveness in the real world.\nPrecision tells us that all the instances in our model predicted speed bumps were correctly predicted. A higher precision means that when our model predicts a speed bump, we can be more confident that there is a speed bump.\nRecall tells us of all the actual speed bumps present and how many my model successfully detects. A high recall means our model effectively detects most of the speed bumps.\nThe F1-score combines precision and recall into a single number, offering a balanced measure of a model's accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets like in our condition."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.1 Comprehensive Analysis of Model Efficacy Across Varied Window Sizes and Sensor Locations", "content": "This study delves into an in-depth examination of three distinct models - 3-BILSTM, 3-TCN, and our proposed ETLNet model - in their roles for detecting"}, {"title": "5.2 Comparative Analysis of Speed Bump Detection Models", "content": "In examining Table 4, we're invited to step back and appreciate the strides made in speed bump detection over the years. The 2018 study by Souza et al. [11]. provided an accuracy of 81.13%. On the other hand, Dey et al. [4]. in 2019 improved the accuracy to 92%. In 2022, Kumar et al. [12].

We analyzed vital metrics such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. One of the most revealing aspects of our investigation was how the choice of window size significantly influenced the effectiveness of each model.\nIn our first experiment, we noted that each model responded differently to changes in window size, impacting their accuracy in speed bump detection. For the BiLSTM model, a window size of 300 consistently produces optimal results across different vehicles and sensor positions. The TCN model, however, presented a more complex story. Its optimal window size varied with each vehicle, suggesting a nuanced sensitivity to the specific characteristics of the data. In contrast, our ETLNet model demonstrated remarkable versatility and strength, maintaining high performance across the board with a uniform window size of 300.\nAs we extended our analysis in Experiment 2, aggregating sensor position data, the ETLNet model continued to shine, achieving the highest average scores across all vehicles. This spoke volumes about its reliability and ability to deliver consistent results in varied scenarios.\nFinally, in Experiment 3, we delved into how well these models generalized their learning across a combined dataset from all vehicles. The results were telling. While the BiLSTM and TCN models performed best with a window size of 300 for specific metrics and sensor positions, the ETLNet model, with a window size of 400, consistently performed better in all respects. This underscored its capability to adapt and excel, even in a diverse and challenging data environment. From the outcomes of our study, it's evident that the dashboard position is particularly effective for this task. In other words, relying solely on data collected from the dashboard also yields promising results.\nThe system is designed to function through a mobile app, where detected speed bumps will be stored with precise location data, either locally or in the cloud. To register a speed bump for the first time, a vehicle must pass over it. Once recorded, the information will be securely shared with other app users, ensuring that drivers approaching the location receive timely alerts. Each additional pass over the bump will increase the system's confidence in its presence, improving accuracy. If multiple vehicles no longer detect it, the bump will be automatically removed from the cloud, keeping the database reliable and up-to-date.\nAlerts are intended to be generated based on the vehicle's speed and distance from the bump, giving drivers enough time to slow down smoothly. Notifications will only trigger for speed bumps along the vehicle's direct path. If a turn is required, the alert will activate only after the vehicle completes the turn and continues straight, avoiding unnecessary distractions.

This study has illuminated the pivotal role of window size in model performance for speed bump detection and highlighted the ETLNet model's standout capabilities. We've demonstrated the importance of fine-tuning model parameters to suit specific data conditions through careful experimentation and analysis. This principle could be invaluable in enhancing sensor-based vehicular systems. Our findings offer a clear pathway for future research and development in this dynamic field."}]}

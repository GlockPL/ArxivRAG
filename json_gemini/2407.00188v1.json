Introduction", "content": null}, {"title": "1.2 Voice linguistics", "content": "Voice linguistics is a subfield of linguistics that examines the role of voice in language [1],\nencompassing both the physiological and acoustic properties of vocal sound production\nand their linguistic implications. Voice linguistics involves analyzing the mechanisms of\nphonation, the variations in vocal fold vibration, and the acoustic features of the resultant\nsound waves. Voice linguistics also investigates sociolinguistic aspects, such as how voice\ncharacteristics can signal identity, emotion, and social status, and how they vary across\ndifferent languages, cultures, and contexts. Through interdisciplinary approaches, voice\nlinguistics aims to deepen our understanding of the intricate relationship between voice\nand language."}, {"title": "1.2 Voice emotion signal analysis", "content": "Voice emotion signal analysis is a field of study that involves examining the acoustic\nproperties of a person's voice to identify and interpret their emotional state.

In healthcare, voice signal analysis can be employed to\ndiagnose and monitor conditions such as vocal fold nodules, polyps, or other disorders that\naffect vocal quality. It can also be used to detect early signs of neurological diseases like\nParkinson's, where voice changes can be an early indicator.\nIn the realm of security, voice signal analysis is utilized for speaker verification and\nidentification, helping to prevent fraud and enhance security systems. This technology can\ndetect stress or deception in a person's voice, which is useful in lie detection and security\nscreenings. Furthermore, in human-computer interaction, voice signal analysis improves\nspeech recognition systems [8, 9, 10], enabling more accurate and natural interactions with\nvirtual assistants and automated systems. The development of sophisticated algorithms\nand machine learning techniques has significantly enhanced the ability to analyze and\ninterpret voice signals, making it a powerful tool for detecting and managing voice\nmisbehaviour across various applications."}, {"title": "1.4 Research Data Objectives", "content": "\u2022\nThis area of study explores how different voice qualities, such as pitch, loudness,\nand timbre, are utilized in communication and how they contribute to meaning\nbeyond the lexical and grammatical components of language.\n\u2022\nFor understanding human behaviour using real-time voice signal analysis, this study\nfocuses on the detection of emotions embedded within vocal expressions. By\ncollecting voice signals in real time, we aim to capture the nuances and subtleties\nthat characterize emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear."}, {"title": "2 Experimental Design, Materials and Methods", "content": "Our research proposed experimental design, materials and methods are examined in this\nsection.

The process involved both\nqualitative and quantitative analysis, utilizing advanced signal processing techniques to\naccurately identify and categorize the recorded speech patterns.

{"title": "Integrating AI for Enhanced Feedback in Translation Revision: A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Student Engagement", "authors": ["Simin Xu", "Yanfang Su", "Kanglong Liu"], "abstract": "Despite the well-established importance of feedback in education, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated feedback, particularly from language models like ChatGPT, remains understudied in translation education. This study investigates the engagement of master's students in translation with ChatGPT-generated feedback during their revision process. A mixed-methods approach, combining a translation-and- revision experiment with quantitative and qualitative analyses, was employed to examine the feedback, translations pre- and post-revision, the revision process, and student reflections. The results reveal complex interrelations among cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions influencing students' engagement with Al feedback and their subsequent revisions. Specifically, the findings indicate that students invested considerable cognitive effort in the revision process, despite finding the feedback comprehensible. Additionally, they exhibited moderate affective satisfaction with the feedback model. Behaviourally, their actions were largely influenced by cognitive and affective factors, although some inconsistencies were observed. This research provides novel insights into the potential applications of AI-generated feedback in translation teachingand opens avenues for further investigation into the integration of AI tools in language teaching settings.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Feedback is a crucial component of educational practice, with a profound impact on student achievement (Hattie, 1992). In the context of translation teaching, feedback plays a vital role in guiding students towards improving their translation skills (Bruton, 2007). However, the traditional model of feedback, where teachers manually craft responses to student work, is time-consuming and often places a significant strain on teachers (Shen et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2024). The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, offers a promising solution to enhance teacher efficiency and provide high-quality feedback. Recent studies have explored the potential of ChatGPT to generate personalized, timely, and detailed feedback (Guo & Wang, 2023; Su & Lin, 2023; AlGhamdi, 2024; Banihashem et al., 2024). However, the majority of these studies have focused on writing, with only a few examining the application of ChatGPT in translation education (Cao & Zhong, 2023). Moreover, research has shown that the effectiveness of feedback is not solely determined by its quality, but also by how students engage with it (Handley et al., 2011). The dynamic interplay between feedback providers and students is a critical aspect of the feedback mechanism. However, there is a notable scarcity of research investigating learner engagement with ChatGPT translation feedback. This study seeks to bridge the existing gap by investigating how Master's students majoring in translation interact with ChatGPT translation feedback on cognitive, affective, and behavioural levels. By exploring the potential of ChatGPT in facilitating translation instruction, this research aims to contribute to the advancement of translation pedagogy and inform the effective integration of AI tools in educational settings."}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "Feedback, a widely employed instructional tool in classrooms, was initially conceptualized as information provided by teachers, peers, books, and texts in response to learners' work or performance (Hattie & Timperley, 2007). In the context of translation, feedback plays a crucial role in supporting and extending learning goals,"}, {"title": "2.1 ChatGPT feedback in language learning and translation", "content": "Building on this concept, Zheng and Yu (2018) proposed a framework that distinguishes between three components of affective engagement: affect (learners' emotions and feelings), judgment (positive or negative evaluation of feedback), and appreciation (the perceived value of feedback). To measure affective engagement, researchers commonly employ questionnaires and self-report methods (Philp & Duchesne, 2016; Guo et al., 2023; Fan & Xu, 2020; Lee et al., 2023), which will be adopted in the present study.\nBehavioural engagement is closely tied to the actions learners take in response to"}, {"title": "2.2 Learner engagement with feedback", "content": "Learner engagement, a multifaceted construct encompassing emotional, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions (Fredricks et al., 2004), is a crucial factor in education. It is widely regarded as a key indicator of the extent to which students are committed to learning (Cheng et al., 2023). This concept is equally relevant to feedback, as its effectiveness is inextricably linked to student engagement (Winstone et al., 2017;\nJ\u00f8rgensen, 2019).\nTo gain a deeper understanding of students' engagement with feedback, researchers have refined its analytical framework (Ellis, 2010; Han & Hyland, 2015;\nZhang & Hyland, 2018; Zheng & Yu, 2018; Qian & Li, 2023). Specifically, cognitive engagement refers to the cognitive processes that learners employ in response to feedback (Ellis, 2010). This construct can be further categorized into three sub-components: awareness, cognitive operations and meta-cognitive operations (Han and Hyland, 2015). Awareness, which is the fundamental level of cognitive"}, {"title": "3. The present study", "content": "As previously discussed, research on student engagement with feedback primarily concentrated on second language writing, while translation feedback has received limited attention. The recent advent of ChatGPT, an advanced technology with sophisticated natural language processing capabilities, offers a promising opportunity to provide feedback on translation assignments. ChatGPT's ability to generate fluent, detailed, and coherent feedback for student assignments in a short time (Dai et al., 2023, p.1) can assist teachers in assessing large classes and reducing their workload. However, the effectiveness of ChatGPT in translation teaching remains largely unexplored, and the nature of student engagement with its feedback in specific learning contexts is unclear.\nDrawing on the framework of student engagement with feedback (Zheng and Yu, 2018), this study aims to investigate how students engage with ChatGPT-generated feedback on their translations during the revision process, encompassing cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions. Specifically, this study will address the following research questions:\nRQ1: How do students engage with feedback provided by ChatGPT cognitively, affectively, and behaviourally?\nRQ2: How do cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagement interact and influence each other when students respond to ChatGPT feedback?"}, {"title": "4. Methodology", "content": "The study was conducted at a university in Hong Kong, with a sample of 29 students enrolled in the Master of Translating and Interpreting programme (MATI). The sample consisted of 21 female students (72.4%) and 8 male students (27.6%), which reflects the gender distribution in the MATI programme. Before the experiment, participants completed a pre-study survey to assess their familiarity with ChatGPT. The results showed that all students were aware of ChatGPT, and the majority (n = 23) had prior experience using it.

The study utilized the platform's test function, which integrated ChatGPT to provide feedback. To ensure consistent and detailed feedback, a built-in prompt was created based on the translation assessment rubric from Hurtado Albir (2015) (see Fig. 2).\nIn the experiment, the participants were first required to translate a Chinese text"}, {"title": "4.3 Data Analysis", "content": "The data analysis encompassed text analysis of participants' feedback and drafts, qualitative interviews, and quantitative surveys, complemented by observational analysis of revision recordings.This study employed a structured measurement framework, which assessed learner engagement across three dimensions: cognitive engagement, affective engagement, and behavioural engagement. To facilitate data analysis, we identified and segmented the data source according to the sub-categories of learner engagement outlined in Table 1, which was refined and adapted from existing engagement frameworks (Zhang & Hyland, 2018; Zheng & Yu, 2018; Qian & Li, 2023)."}, {"title": "4.3.1 Analysis of student translations and ChatGPT feedback", "content": "We coded the content of ChatGPT feedback following the assessment rubric designed for the prompts, as well as the framework established by Tian and Zhou (2020).

Students' responses to the post-survey provided valuable insights into their experiences during the revision process and their perceptions of the feedback received. The oral interviews were transcribed verbatim using the automatic speech recognition app iFlyRec (https://www.iflyrec.com) and subsequently proofread manually by a research assistant to ensure accuracy. Two coders thoroughly read the transcripts multiple times to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content, and then conducted coding based on the framework outlined in Table 1. A qualitative analysis was employed to provide a nuanced and in-depth understanding of interviewees' cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagement. To ensure the trustworthiness of the coding, the two coders cross-referenced students' revision drafts and recordings to validate their responses"}, {"title": "5. Findings", "content": "Prior to presenting the findings on the three dimensions of engagement, it is essential to illustrate the structure and format of the ChatGPT feedback employed in the current study. Our analysis revealed that the feedback generated by ChatGPT, based on the prompt input, typically consisted of three primary components: (1) a reference translation, (2) comments and suggestions, and (3) a grade."}, {"title": "5.1 Cognitive engagement", "content": "To investigate how participants engaged with ChatGPT feedback cognitively, we operationalized cognitive engagement into three dimensions: (1) noticing and understanding the feedback, (2) meta-cognitive strategies to monitor the revision process, and (3) cognitive operations in mental activities to recall and utilize feedback. The post-survey items were categorized according to these dimensions (see Table 3). Overall, the mean scores of the eight survey questions ranged from 3.31 to 4.28, indicating that the participants exhibited a high level of cognitive engagement with ChatGPT feedback. With regard to understanding the feedback, the results of Q1 and Q2 suggested that most participants did not experience significant difficulties in comprehending and revising their work based on the feedback. However, there were also contrasting opinions. Four interviewees noted that while they could understand most suggestions, they found some meaning-level points confusing. For instance, ChatGPT feedback advised Student 1 to focus on coherence and cohesion, but failed to specify the exact errors, leaving her uncertain about how to improve the translation."}, {"title": "5.2 Affective engagement", "content": "According to the conceptual framework in Table 1, affective engagement encompasses both emotional responses and attitudinal responses. The analysis of survey and interview data revealed a complex pattern of this dimension. In terms of emotional responses, students exhibited positive feelings (see Table 4), which is consistent with the findings on cognitive engagement. Specifically, the majority of students found the revision process enjoyable (M = 4.00), and ChatGPT translation feedback generally boosted their confidence and provided encouragement, motivating them to refine their translations further (M = 3.86). A key factor contributing to this positive affective response was the high grades generated by ChatGPT. Student 1 expressed surprise upon checking her grade, as she had not expected such a high mark when she submitted her initial translation. This unexpected outcome boosted her confidence to further revise the translation. However, two students expressed contrasting opinions. Student 2 reported that her feelings were not significantly influenced by the grade, explaining that teachers' scoring is based on comparing the work of all students and provides a more nuanced understanding of translation proficiency within the classroom context. In contrast, ChatGPT's scoring does not offer such comparative insight.\nFurthermore, the descriptive statistics in Table 4 revealed that while positive feedback indeed enhanced students' confidence (M = 4.69), negative feedback did not have a significant impact on their motivations during revision (M = 2.93). All the interviewees acknowledged that they initially felt happy when receiving the feedback. However, they subsequently noticed that ChatGPT tended to generate an overabundance of positive feedback and expressed a preference for more critical suggestionsfor improving the translation. Student 1 remarked that upon first viewing the feedback, she felt quite confident because all the ChatGPT comments were positive. Nevertheless, she soon realized that they did not contribute to improving her translation skills."}, {"title": "5.3 Behavioural Engagement", "content": "Students' behavioural engagement can be examined through their revision operations, observable strategies used to enhance translation quality, and revision time. Feedback uptake and textual modifications indicate how students approached revising their work. As shown in Table 5, the majority of modifications were made in response to"}, {"title": "6. Discussion", "content": "This study revealed that students generally engaged actively with ChatGPT translation feedback on cognitive, affective, and behavioural levels, which supports the idea that collaboration with AI tools can positively impact language learning (Sahari et al., 2023). However, students' engagement demonstrated considerable complexity, illustrating intricate influences and connections both within sub-constructs of each dimension and across the three different dimensions.\nRegarding cognitive engagement, participants generally found the feedback easy to understand, particularly surface-level suggestions. However, a small number of students struggled to comprehend meaning-level feedback, especially concerning cohesion and coherence, and required additional guidance. This difficulty arose from the overly general nature of the feedback, which hindered students' ability to process it effectively. This finding aligns with Su et al.'s (2023) research, which noted that ChatGPT sometimes tends to generate vague feedback. Additionally, students employed a variety of meta-cognitive strategies to regulate their mental effort and plan the revision procedure when addressing the feedback and making corrections. It indicated that students invested extensive cognitive effort to ensure the appropriateness of the feedback and the accuracy of their revised translations. Specific strategies and behaviours were activated, including repeatedly checking feedback, proofreading revisions, and self-correction. The considerable effort required to"}, {"title": "7. Conclusion", "content": "The findings of this study underscore the transformative potential of ChatGPT-generated feedback in the realm of translation education. By introducing AI into the feedback loop, educators can not only alleviate the heavy workload traditionally associated with manual feedback but also enhance the quality and timeliness of the feedback provided to students. This integration can lead to a more dynamic and responsive learning environment where students receive immediate and detailed insights into their translation work. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of fostering a robust engagement framework that encompasses cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions. A nuanced understanding of how students interact with Al-generated feedback can inform the development of more effective pedagogical strategies. For instance, tailoring feedback to address individual learning needs and preferences can significantly enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Furthermore, the implications of this research extend beyond translation education, offering valuable insights for the broader field of language learning and teaching. Future studies should explore the scalability of ChatGPT feedback in different educational contexts and disciplines, as well as its long-term impact on student learning trajectories.\nDespite these findings and the valuable insights gained, our study had some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, since the output of ChatGPT is influenced by the quality of prompts (OpenAI, 2022), the effectiveness of feedback could be improved by enhancing prompt quality. Second, we utilized ChatGPT 3.5, the most advanced version available at the time of the experiment. As technology progresses, more recent AI models should be considered to ensure the study remains current. Third, our investigation of student engagement was limited to a single experiment, which may not fully capture the complexities of engagement over time. Future studies should explore the long-term impact of ChatGPT feedback on student learning by conducting longitudinal research. Additionally, comparative studies involving different AI models could provide a deeper understanding of the evolving capabilities of AI in educational contexts. Further research should also investigate the potential of ChatGPT feedback across diverse learner populations, including those with varying levels of proficiency and training experience, to determine its broader applicability in translation education."}, {"title": "Data Availability", "content": "The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."}, {"title": "Declarations", "content": null}, {"title": "Ethical Approval", "content": "The authors confirm that all the research meets ethical guidelines and adheres to the legal requirements of the study country."}, {"title": "Consent to Participate", "content": "Informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in this study."}, {"title": "Conflict of Interests", "content": "The authors declare no conflict of interests."}, {"title": "Appendix 1.

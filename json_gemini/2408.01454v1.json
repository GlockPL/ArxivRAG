The SC paradigm aims to improve\ncitizens' quality of life and protect the city's environment. As we enter the age of next-generation SCs, it is important to\nexplore all relevant aspects of the SC paradigm. In recent years, the advancement of Information and Communication\nTechnologies (ICT) has produced a trend of supporting daily objects with smartness, targeting to make human life easier\nand more comfortable. The paradigm of SCs appears as a response to the purpose of building the city of the future with\nadvanced features. SCs still face many challenges in their implementation, but increasingly more studies regarding SCs\nare implemented. Nowadays, different cities are employing SC features to enhance services or the residents quality of\nlife. This work provides readers with useful and important information about Amman Smart City.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction: smart cities", "content": "Along with the evolution of society, there has been a significant development of ICT. Technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and\ncloud computing have gained importance in recent times [1]. IoT is the heart of SCs. These technologies are becoming a main part of the\nevolution of cities. Therefore, urbanization and ICT have led to the emergence of the SC paradigm [2]. SCs have been greatly developed\nand have significantly extended their capabilities in recent years. In general, SC is an urban area that exploits ICT to improve the quality\nof life of its citizens (i.e., the heart of a SC) as well as the sustainability and efficiency of its operations.\nSCs are those modern cities that employ modern ICT facilities to satisfy their citizens [3]. According to recent research studies, by 2030,\nsixty percent of the country's population will be occupied in modern cities [4]. Therefore, living in modern cities poses a great challenge\nfor governments, as it is not easy to manage these large cities using traditional methods, especially when the number of citizens increases\nsignificantly and thus the demand for services increases. Thus, modern SCs will be able to accommodate these large numbers of citizens\nand manage their various needs, as SCs are equipped with modern ICT facilities.\nIoT technology is centered on embedding sensors into everyday objects and utilizing connectivity to enable information exchange for\nvarious applications. There are more objects available than people in a city, so the amount of connectivity that IoT devices hold is vast.\nUnlike the internet, which is a grid of networks, the IoT is a network of interconnected devices. IoT devices are crucial in people's daily\nlives in the city, managing large volumes of data. IoT devices can be viewed as a mesh of communicated devices that implies sending and\noperating devices that offer the capacity for information exchange among distinct platforms in a city [5]. IoT devices have lots of valuable\napplications when they appear in SCs [6]. A SC can be recognized as a city that is supplied with technology, like sensors and cameras that\ngather data; it is exploited to make critical decisions in the management of city operations [7].\nThis article covers the main topics relevant to Amman smart city; mainly, it covers the following topics: smart city definitions, architectures,\ntechnologies, application domains, case studies, challenges, and research opportunities."}, {"title": "2 Amman smart city", "content": "Through the last decade, several cities around the world have attempted to change from a conventional city to a SC. But, in several cases,\nthose endeavors have been unsuccessful, even though there have been considerable investments from the public and private sectors.\nThis section presents Amman as a SC (cf. summary in Table 4). Amman ranks 128th in the IMD SC Index 2024 (i.e., 128 out of 142),\nwhile the city is ranked 135th in the same index in 2023. Amman is the capital of Jordan. It is located in the northwest of Jordan. Amman\nhas an area of about 7,579 km\u00b2. The population of Amman is expected to reach six million in 2025. Amman's vision is to improve the\nquality of life for Amman's citizens with the utilization of practical technology and achieve resilient and sustainable development. The\nbasic elements of the approach toward SC are automation using new technology, business process re-engineering, and the private sector.\nThe city approach aims at identifying the essential resources to achieve the SC vision, assessing stakeholder concerns and user needs, and\ndefining the potential projects to be included in the city roadmap.\nAmman was built as a traditional city with basic infrastructure (i.e., buildings, streets, hospitals, universities, schools, and so on). Currently,\nthe city adopts modern technology infrastructure, such as 4G/5G networks, high-speed communication lines, machines and computers\nwith high specifications, high-speed internal networks, data centers of high standards, disaster recovery methodologies, secure firewalls,\nblockchain, cybersecurity, AI, etc.\nThe digital transformation in Amman led to several improvements in various domains of the city. Some of these improvements include:\n100% of e-services completed; 134 services available online; paperless procedures at Greater Amman Municipality (GAM); the GAM\napp; the Unified Inspection System (UIS); QR code apps; and a decrease in the number of visitors to city government facilities by 98%.\nIn 2019, GAM developed a SC roadmap for Amman [32]. This roadmap exploits the latest improvements in technologies (AI and big\ndata) to resolve the city's urban planning requests. Moreover, this roadmap tries to increase the use of e-services and automate procedures\nin several ministries to attain transparency and increase the efficiency of government services and functions. Also, the roadmap intends to\nimprove city services and reduce traffic congestion inside Amman.\nMany benefits have been achieved in the city of Amman after applying the SC paradigm. Some of these benefits include e-payments\n(e.g., eFAWATEERcom), end-to-end services, efficiency of city functions and services (cost, quality, and speed), simple procedures\n(i.e., e-transactions), traffic congestion management, paperless procedures (i.e., eco-friendly), employee training, etc.\nAmman, a highly urbanized capital, faces several open challenges. Some of those challenges are rapidly growing population and traffic\ncongestion, large number of refugees in Jordan, human resources capabilities for smart solutions, economic challenges globally and\nregionally, citizen behavior and habits, and so on (cf. Figure 2).\nAs some researchers center their study on a specific domain of SCs, Table 5 presents the challenges of specific domains inside SCs, such\nas agriculture, healthcare, and so forth.\nThe multidisciplinary nature of SCs creates multiple research challenges. Table 6 presents the open challenges of SC (i.e., author's\nopinion).\nThe ICT sector evolves rapidly in Jordan, especially in Amman. The ICT sector plays an important role in Gross Domestic Product (GDP),\nwhere it is considered the third biggest contributor to GDP. Thus, one of the main drivers of Amman's sustainable growth is the ICT sector.\nThis sector can assist in modernizing the public sector and providing smart infrastructure, such as smart building and transport, e-services,\nand data collection and analytics. Finally, this sector can also offer support for evidence-based policymaking.\nBased on the knowledge acquired through the literature review, Figure 3 presents the research opportunities that are promising and related\nto the SC paradigm. These research opportunities are also applicable in the city of Amman.\nSeveral studies have been done in the fields of water and food management inside SCs. These fields have not been very well explored\nyet; thus, it is possible to advance these fields in several areas, such as crop management, transgenic research, water management, water\nstorage, and so on.\nComputer Vision (CV) is a multidiscipline field including engineering, biology, mathematics, psychology, and physics disciplines. It aims\nto address how computers obtain useful interpretations of digital images and videos. Thus, it improves a computer's ability to obtain,\nprocess, analyze, and interpret digital media. CV involves vast subdomains, such as object tracking, motion estimation, virtual reality,"}, {"title": "3 Summary", "content": "In summary, the implementation of SCs is still missing many points: the definition of the SC concept; choosing the appropriate architecture\nof SC; addressing the open and domain challenges of SC; following a SC roadmap where future phases that the city should take are\nobviously planned and designed in advance; settling the best practice guidelines in the field of SC; and discussing research opportunities\nfor SC.\nIn order to create smart, green, digital, and human-centric cities of the future, there is a need to give more care to education, investments,\nstrategies, and the sharing of experiences. In that scenario, integrating inclusion with digital transformation will still be a big challenge for\nall types of cities around the world.\nIn conclusion, this work has analyzed whether Amman has a SC vision, a platform, a designed roadmap, a dedicated department focused\non the evolution of Amman as a SC, the SC domains the city covers, the projects that have been executed in Amman, and the technologies\nused."}]}

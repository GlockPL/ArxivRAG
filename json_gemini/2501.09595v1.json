The present study\nproposes a novel, data-informed fall risk assessment method based on the instrumented\nTimed Up and Go (ITUG) test data, bringing in many mobility measures that traditional\nclinical scales fail to capture. IFRA, which stands for Instrumented Fall Risk Assessment,\nhas been developed using a two-step process: first, features with the highest predictive\npower among those collected in a ITUG test have been identified using machine learning\ntechniques; then, a strategy is proposed to stratify patients into low, medium, or high-risk\nstrata. The dataset used in our analysis consists of 142 participants, out of which 93 were\nused for training (15 synthetically generated), 17 for validation and 32 to test the resulting\nIFRA scale (22 non-fallers and 10 fallers). Features considered in the IFRA scale include\ngait speed, vertical acceleration during sit-to-walk transition, and turning angular\nvelocity, which align well with established literature on the risk of fall in neurological\npatients. In a comparison with traditional clinical scales such as the traditional Timed Up\n& Go and the Mini-BESTest, IFRA demonstrates competitive performance, being the only\nscale to correctly assign more than half of the fallers to the high-risk stratum (Fischer's\nExact test p = 0.004). Despite the dataset's limited size, this is the first proof-of-concept\nstudy to pave the way for future evidence regarding the use of IFRA tool for continuous\npatient monitoring and fall prevention both in clinical stroke rehabilitation and at home\npost-discharge.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide after road\ntraffic injuries [1]. Individuals who have experienced a stroke are seven times more likely\nto experience a fall compared to healthy individuals [2,3,4,5]. Within the first year\nfollowing a stroke, the likelihood of a fall is estimated at 50% [6], with 5% of these falls\nleading to serious injuries [7], [8].\nFalls also cause anxiety, fear of falling, and depression [9], [10], therefore eventually\nreducing independence further. For example, fear of falling can trigger a vicious cycle\nof inactivity, worsening balance, and further increasing such risk. A poorer balance\nalso worsens disability [9].\nFall risk assessment and interventions to reduce the risk of falls are needed to reduce\nthis burden. Effective interventions for mitigating the risk of falling include rehabilitation\ninvolving therapeutic exercise, home adaptations, and education on fall risk factors, such\nas the drugs strongly associated with falls (e.g., benzodiazepines). About the first,\nassessing the number and the severity of a patient's fall risk factors is essential since\nseveral of them can be, at least in principle, modified (e.g., poor balance, or home\nhazards for falls).\nThe list of fall risk factors in stroke is long, with over 100 risk factors listed in a recent\nsystematic review [11]. Fall risk charts for stroke patients include various variables [12]:\nadvanced age, previous strokes or falls, hemiparesis severity, the presence of cognitive\nimpairment or of urinary incontinence, the use of sedatives and other psychotropic\ndrugs, and the presence of depression. Finally, it is important to consider that falls\nfollowing a stroke are significantly influenced by the degree of mobility impairment [13].\nIn the last decades, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) have been increasingly used in\nmovement analysis and assessment, including for the case of patients affected by\nneurological conditions and stroke. IMUs have transformed the way human movement is\nrecorded by leveraging their being minute, extremely lightweight, relatively low-cost, and\neasy to use. Their use is now widespread also in clinics and not only in research settings\n[14,15].\nSeveral classical mobility tests have been extended with the use of IMUs. Among these,\nthere is the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test [16]. Indeed, in motor disorder assessment,\nIMUs can broaden traditional clinical tests into a source of novel mobility measures. In\nthe TUG test, examinees are asked to complete a circuit consisting of different basic\nmotor functions of daily living, including passing from sitting to standing, walking,\nturning, and sitting down. The time needed to complete the test is commonly measured\nwith a stopwatch, and usually, the TUG test duration (TTD) represents the only\nmeasurement extracted from this test. Instead, when instrumented with one or more\nIMUs, the TUG test can provide several new measures of movement, such as the duration\nof the different tasks that make up the test, the movement speed (e.g., the angular\nvelocity during the turning phase), and more articulated measures as the movements'"}, {"title": "2.

Out of 142 participants, data\nfor 15 participants have been synthetically generated to improve the balancing between\nfallers and non-fallers. Below we provide additional details about the dataset\ncomposition and augmentation process.\nFirstly, we have limited our analysis exclusively to the following two classes of features:\n\u2022\nClinical assessment (8 features): This includes the averaged data collected from five\nrepetitions of both the TTD of the TUG test and the 10MWT, along with the results from\nthe MB, POMA-B, the Conley Scale, the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) and\nthe FIM.\n\u2022\nITUG assessment (100 features): Data obtained from the ITUG test contributes 100\nfeatures.\nA complete list of all features is provided in the Supplementary Materials.\nSecondly, we excluded from the original dataset individuals with missing records, such\nas incomplete discharge assessments or follow-up calls. Excluding participants with\nmissing data was necessary to ensure all features were available for all analyses.\nAfter this step, we obtained a dataset including 127 subjects, out of which only 39 were\nfallers. To mitigate the imbalance between faller and non-faller patients, in our dataset\nwe augmented the faller group by 38% (15 individuals). To augment the dataset, we\nrandomly selected 15 fallers and added Gaussian noise to each of their features. The\namount of noise added was based on the variance of each respective feature. This\nprocess increased the final dataset size to 142 individuals, out of which 54 are fallers and\n88 are non-fallers. Next, we divided the dataset into training, validation and test subsets."}, {"title": "3. Methods", "content": "In a preliminary analysis, we utilized a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict\nfalls. We trained the model on a balanced subset of 60 patients (30 fallers and 30\nrandomly selected non-fallers) using all features in a 7-fold cross-validation process.\nHowever, this method yielded unsatisfactory results with significant variability in SVM\naccuracy depending on the specific non-faller sample. This variability suggested\nlimitations due to the dataset size. Consequently, we opted for a different strategy\nfocusing on fall risk stratification.\nThis approach categorizes patients into low, medium, and high fall risk groups. To achieve\nthis, we implemented a two-step process. In the first step, we employed a combination\nof random sampling techniques, SVM classification and statistical analysis to identify a\nsubset of key features that best distinguish fallers from non-fallers. The approach\nresulted in a set of informative features for fall risk assessment. Then, we utilized these\nfeatures to develop a risk assessment method for classifying patients into the three fall\nrisk strata (low, medium, or high). The following subsections will provide a detailed\nexplanation of this approach and the development of the risk assessment method.

For each feature, we extract and rank\nthe values of all 93 training set subjects. The ranking direction (ascending or descending)\ndepends on the expected relationship with fall risk. For example, features like TUG\nduration (longer time indicates higher risk) are ranked from lowest to highest, while\nfeatures like gait speed (faster speed indicates lower risk) are ranked from highest to\nlowest.\nOnce ranked for a single feature, the subjects are divided into three sets of 31 each. These\nsets represent low, medium, and high risk based on that specific feature. The feature\nvalues for the subjects at the 31st and 62nd percentiles (delimiting the set in tertiles) are\nstored for each feature. By iterating through all M features, we establish thresholds based\non their distributions within the training data.

This process resulted in the development of a new fall\nrisk assessment scale, which we refer to as IFRA, capable of classifying new patients into\nstrata based on their ITUG features. Features and corresponding threshold values for\nIFRA are reported in Table 2."}, {"title": "4.2. Fall Risk Evaluation", "content": "To assess the effectiveness of our approach in classifying patients into fall risk strata, we\nconducted tests on a separate set of 32 unseen volunteers (i.e., test set). These\nvolunteers were purposely excluded from the initial feature selection and scale\ndevelopment phases to avoid bias. It is important to note that the test set exhibits an\nimbalanced distribution, containing 22 non-fallers and 10 fallers. The results of this\nevaluation are presented in Table 4 and Figure 2.\nEach assessment scale independently ranks patients according to the threshold values\nextracted from the literature, as detailed before and shown in Table 3. Notably, most\nscales fail to classify faller patients into the high-risk stratum, with only the FES-I scale\nsuccessfully ranking 3 out of 10 faller patients in this category. However, for FES-I, along\nwith other scales such as FIM and Conley, the distribution of fallers and non-fallers\nacross the strata is quite similar. The most effective scales were those based on the MB,\nPOMA-B, and TUG test. To further validate these results, we formulated the following null\n(Ho) and alternative (H\u2081) hypothesis to be tested using the Fisher's Exact test [46].\nHo: In the population of patients in the test set, the assigned risk strata are not related to\ntheir faller or non-faller status.\nH\u2081: In the population of patients in the test set, the assigned risk strata are related to their\nfaller or non-faller status.\nThe p-values computed using Fisher's Exact Test, are reported in the last column of the\ntable. For none of the considered scales was it possible to reject the null hypothesis (p <\n0.05), suggesting a weak relationship between the assigned strata and fall risk."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "At first glance, the IFRA scale seems more effective at classifying subjects as fallers or\nnon-fallers into the appropriate risk strata. To validate this observation, we performed the\nstatistical evaluation described earlier. The Fisher's Exact test yielded a p-value of 0.004,\nallowing us to reject the null hypothesis (H0). This result suggests that there is sufficient\nstatistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (H1), indicating that the risk\nstrata assigned by the IFRA scale are indeed associated with the subject's faller or non-\nfaller status and thus supporting the claim that the IFRA scale can be used to estimate\nfall risk in the target population."}, {"title": "5.1. Analysis of the Results", "content": "In this study, we investigate a new proposal for a fall risk index aimed at stroke patients\nusing machine learning. In a preliminary phase, we identified the features that\npredispose the individuals to a higher risk of falling, including both clinical measures\nborrowed from ordinary clinical practice, and the instrumental measures collected\nduring an ITUG test. Starting from these results, a new tool, referred to as IFRA, was\ndesigned and developed. While such a tool is designed using machine learning methods,\nit ultimately results in a table of significant features with threshold values that a clinician\ncan then use to assign a patient to one of three risk strata. Similarly to what happens with\nclinical and widespread evaluation scales, this can be performed by simply collecting\nmeasures of significant features related to the patient, and then use the threshold values\nto assign each feature to a corresponding risk stratum. The patient's overall risk stratum\nis then given by the mode of the features' risk strata assignments. It follows that all the\nfeatures are considered to have equal importance in the IFRA scale.\nNevertheless, in Section 3.1.1, we describe a methodology to select significant features\nwhich also allows to rank features by their discriminating power.

Future Perspectives", "content": "Recent advancements in wearable technology, especially when using a single IMU, as in\nthe case of ITUG in this study, along with improvements in computational platforms for\nthe analysis of motion data, have significantly broaden the available options for\nmonitoring and evaluating patients in various settings. According to the findings of this\nstudy, instrumental motion analysis demonstrates a high capability to identify individuals\nat risk of falling, as well as clinical measurements alone. This result may lead to the\nselection of proper measures that are useful in defining fall risk according to the specific\ncontext of the patient, whether it be a hospital or an in-home setting.\nObtaining accurate and timely patient information, particularly from patients with\nimpaired mobility, is a critical issue that requires the utmost attention in future studies.\nThis in turn enables frequent and straightforward monitoring of physical performance\nand fall risk, for instance, at home and without clinical personnel. In principle, our\napproach enables the timely detection of any motor decline that may lead to an\nincreased risk for individuals, prompting them or their caregivers to seek medical\nattention earlier.

However, the number\nof recruited patients aligns with that of other studies [47,48], and the findings obtained\noffer promising indications of the proposed method's potential in fall risk assessment. To\nfully validate the proposed method's efficacy and application, further exploration is\nneeded, particularly through larger scale studies and testing on different pathologies.\nThe use of algorithms to automatically segment the ITUG test into its constituent phases\n(ii) is another possible limitation of this work, as such phases are then used to derive\nother measures later used in our analysis. While the reliability of these segmentation\nalgorithms has been demonstrated [33], it is important to note that automatic algorithms\nmay falter [49], especially in specific populations like frail individuals. For example, as\ngait and mobility become more pathological (e.g., a high TTD), it might become harder for\nsegmentation algorithms to recognize mobility patterns and thresholds for TUG.\nNevertheless, our results on the test set still show promising results, at least in the\npopulation considered in this study. Again, further exploration might be needed to both\nassess the impact of different segmentation algorithms and the applicability of\nautomatic segmentation techniques to patients presenting a higher level of motion\nimpairment.\nThe absence of solid normative data references in the literature for a healthy age-\nmatched population (iii) is a limitation of this work which directly derives from the current\nstate of the art on the matter.

Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we explored the potential of IMUs coupled with machine learning\ntechniques to advance the field of fall risk assessment in post-stroke rehabilitation. The\nmotivation behind this research was to harness the potential of IMUs and turn the\ntraditional TUG test into a more nuanced source of mobility measures. This study\nresulted in the proposal of a new fall risk assessment scale, the Instrumented Fall Risk\nAssessment, which uses data from the ITUG to stratify patients into low, medium, and\nhigh fall risk groups.\nOur method involves feature selection using a Support Vector Machine classifier,\ndetermining significant features and thresholds over randomized subsets of training\ndata. The identified discriminating features, such as gait speed measured in the ITUG\ntest, vertical acceleration during sit-to-walk transition, and turning angular velocity, agree\nwith existing studies and our prior investigations on balance measures. Further, the\nthresholds identified allow us to stratify patients into specific risk levels based on the\nfeatures extracted from the ITUG. Finally, our results suggest that the IFRA could be\ncompared to the traditional clinical scales in terms of identifying fall risk among stroke\npatients.\nDespite the encouraging findings, the study has limitations in terms of generalizability,\nmainly due to the relatively small dataset size. Nevertheless, the proposed approach\nunderscores the potential of employing straightforward, quantifiable methods that do\nnot necessitate either trained professionals, complex computations, or extensive\nresources for effective fall risk assessment.

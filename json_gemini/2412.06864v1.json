Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we\u2014a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science\u2014present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies. In particular, from the political science perspective, we highlight the role of LLMs in automating predictive and generative tasks, simulating behavior dynamics, and improving causal inference through tools like counterfactual generation; from a computational perspective, we introduce advancements in data preparation, fine-tuning, and evaluation methods for LLMs that are tailored to political contexts. We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science. Political-LLM seeks to serve as a guidebook for researchers to foster an informed, ethical, and impactful use of Artificial Intelligence in political science. Our online resource is available at: http://political-llm.org/.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Recent years have witnessed the extraordinary capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their contributions to a plethora of fields, such as healthcare [1, 2, 3, 4], finance [5, 6, 7], scientific discoveries [8, 9, 10], transportation [11, 12, 13, 14], and education [15, 16, 17], to name a few. The success of LLMs is mainly attributed to the pre-training over web-scale text corpora [18], which has equipped them with remarkable language intelligence to analyze complicated linguistic patterns [19, 20]. Such outstanding capabilities have been found to align with the pursuit of language analysis in a series of sub-fields in social science [21, 22, 23], where political science has stood out with abundant explorations and substantial advancements [24, 25, 26]. Political science is broadly defined as the study of political systems, behavior, institutions, and policy-making processes, aiming to understand how power and resources are distributed within societies [27, 28]. It relies on diverse forms of political data, including legislative documents, political speeches, public opinion surveys, and news reports, which serve as the foundation for political analysis [29, 30].\nTraditionally, political science relied heavily on qualitative methods [31], such as content analysis and case studies, alongside quantitative approaches like statistical modeling and surveys, to examine trends and patterns in political behavior. These methods, while foundational, often faced challenges in scaling, handling multilingual and unstructured data, and deriving insights from vast corpora of text. The emergence of LLMs has helped overcome these hurdles by enabling automated, large-scale analysis of political data, providing researchers with unprecedented tools to process and interpret political texts more effectively. In particular, LLMs have been critical in analyzing extensive corpora of political texts [32, 33], encompassing a wide range of sources such as political speeches [34, 35], legislative documents [36, 37], social media content [38, 39], and news articles [40, 41]. Through these practices, LLMs have enabled stakeholders such as researchers and policy makers to gain an in-depth understanding of various facets such as political behavior [42], public opinion [43], policy formulation [44], and latest election dynamics [45]. For instance, LLMs have revolutionized sentiment analysis by providing nuanced interpretations of public reactions to political events, policies, and figures [46]. This enhanced capability has been crucial in understanding voter sentiment [47] and forecasting election outcomes with greater accuracy [48]. As another example, researchers have employed LLMs to predict legislative voting patterns [49], identify emerging political trends [50], and assess the impact of policy changes on public opinion [51]. The automation of these analytical processes has not only accelerated the pace of research but also increased its precision, allowing for more robust and comprehensive analyses [52].\nDespite the considerable advancements facilitated by LLMs, significant gaps remain hindering their full potential from being realized in this emerging field [22, 53, 54]. Here we identify three most significant gaps below. The first gap, which arises from an interdisciplinary perspective, results from the absence of a systematic understanding of how the potential of LLMs interacts with political science [22]. For example, without a well-defined framework for adapting LLMs to analyze political data, researchers face challenges when attempting to utilize these models for sophisticated tasks, such as analyzing legislative patterns [55] or mapping ideological shifts over time [56]. As such, researchers and practitioners working in political science can encounter difficulty when they resort to ready-to-use LLMs. The second gap, which is rooted in computer science, comes from the lack of fundamental insights about exploiting appropriate techniques to improve LLMs for political science [53]. As an example, LLMs can exhibit characteristics that are undesirable in political science, such as societal bias [57], hallucinations [58], privacy leakage [59], and high computational costs [60].\nTo facilitate the utility of LLMs in political science, appropriate techniques should be leveraged to handle these issues. For instance, knowledge editing techniques [61, 62] can be used to mitigate the bias exhibited by LLMs, and machine unlearning [63, 64] can be leveraged to remove privacy-related information from LLMs, thereby building more appropriate LLMs for political science. The final gap, which comes from political science, lies in the general deficiency of domain-specific knowledge integrated with LLMs [54]. With the lack of such knowledge of political science, obtaining outputs that are properly informed by a nuanced context from general LLMs becomes difficult. For instance, political texts often contain complex references to historical events, ideological nuances, and policy implications that general LLMs may fail to interpret accurately without specialized training data [65, 66].\nResearch interest in adapting LLMs to political science applications has been growing rapidly in recent years [49, 67, 53]. A search in major academic databases shows a more than 300% increase in publications related to \"LLMs and political science\" between year 2020 and 2024, highlighting the field's continuous expansion and great potential. This surge is driven by LLMs' ability to process complicated political texts [68], extract ideological patterns [69], and simulate decision-making processes [70, 71] at an unprecedented scale. Back in 2020, Chatsiou et al. [72] discussed the potential influence and applications of LLMs in political science. Nevertheless, the naivety and simplicity of LLMs at that time greatly limited the insights and depth of the discussion. More recently, researchers have investigated specific tasks in political science domain, leveraging LLMs as the main approach. [65, 69, 73] focused on debates analysis and ideological mapping. [74, 24, 75] centered on political election and voting, including election outcome prediction, election dynamics, and voting behavior modeling. [76, 77] investigated the role of LLMs in shaping opinions and conducting polls. [78, 79] explored the contribution of LLMs in enhancing democracy and society values. In contrast to the emergence of works on specific task-level applications, there are only a few survey studies related to LLMs in political science [67, 22]. A comprehensive and systematic survey of recent advances aimed at fostering an in-depth understanding of this topic is urgently needed to assist researchers from multiple fields and to illuminate opportunities for cross-disciplinary ideas.\nIn this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive examination of leveraging LLMs' power to harness the field of political science, addressing key challenges and identifying future research directions. Specifically, we begin by presenting a novel taxonomy to systematically classify existing works in this interdisciplinary domain. This taxonomy categorizes methods and applications, enabling researchers and practitioners to navigate the field more effectively and bridging the first gap identified above regarding the lack of systematic understanding. Next, we explore current advancements from both political and technical perspectives, highlighting techniques for adapting LLMs to political science applications and addressing domain-specific challenges. This section addresses the second gap by delving into solutions for mitigating undesirable characteristics of LLMs, such as societal biases, hallucinations, and privacy concerns, and discusses techniques like knowledge editing and machine unlearning. To bridge the third gap, we further discuss the integration of political science domain knowledge with LLMs, examining the distinct nature of political information and proposing countermeasures to adapt general LLMs for nuanced political tasks. We illustrate how specialized datasets and fine-tuning approaches can be utilized to enhance contextual accuracy and depth. Finally, we explore real-world applications of LLMs in political science, ranging from election prediction and policy analysis to misinformation detection, and conclude with an examination of the current challenges and promising future directions. The survey thus serves as a resource for advancing the understanding and application of LLMs in political science.\nThe main contributions of this survey paper are summarized as:\n\u2022 A Novel Principled Taxonomy. We propose a novel taxonomy for adapting LLMs in political science, structured around two main categories: Classic Political Science Functionality and LLM-Driven Methodologies as shown in Figure 2. The first category addresses core political science tasks, including predictive and generative tasks, simulation, causal inference, and social impacts. The second category focuses on computational methods that customize LLMs to political contexts, including benchmark datasets, data preparation strategy, model design under zero-shot/few-shot learning and fine-tuning scenarios, and inference techniques. The taxonomy provides a systematic framework to bridge existing knowledge gaps, guiding researchers in understanding and applying LLMs effectively within political science field.\n\u2022 Comprehensive and Multi-Perspective Review.

This innovation marked a departure from earlier sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs, which struggled with vanishing gradients and limited context windows. Core components such as multi-head attention, feedforward layers, and positional encodings enabled Transformers to process sequences in parallel, significantly improving scalability and efficiency. Early LLMs, such as BERT [90], leveraged the Transformer framework through masked language modeling, excelling in bidirectional context understanding. Autoregressive architectures like GPT [92] later extended these capabilities, focusing on sequential token prediction for fluent and coherent text generation. The advent of models like T5 [93] unified various NLP tasks under a single architecture by using sequence-to-sequence learning. Recent advancements [94, 95, 96, 97] further evolved LLM architectures, emphasizing efficiency and task-specific adaptability.

Political data encompasses diverse sources such as political news, speeches, legislative records, party manifestos, social media contents, etc. Analyzing these data requires handling challenges like data scarcity, imbalance, and linguistic nuances, which hinder comprehensive analysis. One critical application in CPS is Political Text Generation, where LLMs are employed to produce political content such as speeches, policy briefs, and debate scripts [122]. These generative models assist political figures and analysts by creating coherent, persuasive, and contextually relevant texts. LLMs can simulate political scenarios and craft narratives, shaping public opinion and enhancing political communication.\nElection Prediction and Voting Behavior. Election prediction focuses on forecasting voter turnout, swing state dynamics, and overall electoral outcomes. LLMs analyze a combination of historical election data, public opinion surveys, and social media discourse to identify patterns influencing voter behavior [24, 123]. These models provide insights into key demographic and psychological factors affecting voter preferences, aiding political campaigns and policymakers in tailoring strategies to engage the electorate effectively.\nPolicy and Legislative Interpretation. Policy and legislative interpretation involves analyzing complex legal texts, such as bills, statutes, administrative rules, and debates, to understand their implications and the ideologies they represent. LLMs excel at parsing and summarizing these documents, identifying key arguments, and"}, {"title": "3 Taxonomy on LLM for Political Science", "content": "Figure 2 presents a comprehensive taxonomy for understanding the integration of LLMs in political science, organized into two main categories: classified political science functionalities & tasks and LLM-driven computational approaches for political science. The first category highlights how traditional political science functions are enhanced through LLM capabilities, while the second category focuses on computational techniques for effectively implementing LLMs in political research.\nThe classified political science functional tasks span five primary categories, including Predictive Tasks, Generative Tasks, Simulation, Explainability & Causal Inference, and Social Impacts. Predictive Tasks (section 4.1) use LLMs to analyze and forecast trends in public opinion, electoral outcomes, and policy impacts. Generative Tasks (section 4.2) enable the synthesis of political data, such as summarizing legislative documents or generating debate transcripts [262, 263], expanding the scope and accessibility of political data analysis. Simulation (section 4.3) leverages LLMs to model complex political behaviors and interactions [147, 264], reducing research costs and enhancing efficiency in studying dynamics like voting patterns and policy impact. Explainability & Causal Inference (section 4.4) applies LLMs to identify relationships and generate counterfactuals in political analysis [159, 160], providing insights into causality and potential biases.

Benchmark Datasets (section 5.1) provide foundational resources on political topics, while Data Processing (section 5.2) addresses issues of bias, annotation, and augmentation to ensure data reliability and representativeness. Fine-tuning (section 5.3) explores methods to tailor LLMs for specific political science tasks, optimizing performance through targeted training strategies. Inference under Zero-Shot (section 5.4) and Few-Shot Learning (section 5.5) highlight approaches for achieving task-specific insights with minimal labeled data,"}, {"title": "4 Classical Political Science Functions and Modern Transformations", "content": "LLMs have brought transformative changes to political science, reshaping traditional methodologies and unlocking new analytical opportunities. This section provides a structured overview of current research, categorizing it into five key areas. Four of these areas focus on the functional applications of LLMs in political science, while the fifth explores normative considerations, emphasizing societal and ethical implications.\nWe divide the functional categories into predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks. While computer science researchers often categorize LLM-based research into predictive and generative tasks"}, {"title": "4.1 Automation of Predictive Tasks", "content": "Definition. Predictive tasks in Computational Political Science involve anticipating future events or trends based on existing data, and they are fundamental in political science for applications such as election forecasting, policy support prediction, and analyzing voter behavior. In political science, predictive tasks are crucial because they provide insights that can guide decision-making, inform policy, and help researchers understand complex social dynamics. Traditional predictive methods in political science often require extensive manual labor. For instance, certain predictive tasks may require researchers to manually collect survey responses, historical election data, or economic indicators, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. In contrast, recent advancements in LLMs offer an alternative by automating predictive tasks. The automation of predictive tasks reduces manual effort and possible human error, while increasing speed, consistency, and scalability.\nEnhancing Prediction with LLM-based Data Annotation. LLM-based automation significantly enhances predictive capabilities by providing consistent and scalable solutions for data-intensive tasks. This is especially helpful in data annotation. Annotating large datasets manually is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies [33, 68, 129]. LLMs can rapidly process and annotate data in a consistent manner. Political science researchers have employed LLMs to annotate Political Ideology [33, 130, 131, 132], Fake News [134, 135, 136, 137], Tone (sentiment) [33, 68, 132, 140, 139], and content of various Political Texts [33, 68, 138, 133, 132]. Researchers also find that the quality of automated LLM annotation outperforms crowd workers and even some domain experts. Therefore, data annotation by LLM not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the potential for human bias and error in the data annotation process.\nPrediction Tasks in English-Speaking Contexts. The effectiveness of LLMs in predictive tasks is demonstrated through their applications in both English and non-English contexts. In English-speaking settings, platforms like ChatGPT and Llama are frequently used for large-scale political text analysis. For instance, Lashitew and Mu [139] analyze comments and letters submitted by companies to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding climate change disclosure regulations. Leveraging GPT-3, they efficiently process and analyze a large volume of text data, identifying patterns and sentiments within the corporate responses. Additionally, [140] explore the application of GPT-4 in processing and analyzing public feedback collected online in New Zealand. They focus on responses to a proposed plan change in Hamilton City, New Zealand, assessing GPT-4's effectiveness in summarizing feedback, identifying topics, and analyzing sentiment. Results showed GPT-4 performed these tasks accurately.\nPredictive Tasks in Non-English Contexts. LLMs have also shown robust performance in multilingual environments and in diverse regional applications. [33] evaluate the performance of GPT-4 in coding political texts across variables such as relevance, negativity, sentiment, and ideology across the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy. The findings indicate that GPT-4's annotations closely align with those of human experts, suggesting that LLMs can effectively assist in political text analysis. Moreover, Chalkidis and Brandl [131] utilize Llama to evaluate speeches from European Parliament debates, with the EUandI questionnaire serving as a reference or benchmark to verify political leanings. The study demonstrated that Llama has considerable knowledge of national parties' positions and is capable of contextual reasoning as well as ChatGPT. Mellon et al. [146] take a step further to evaluate six different popular LLMs in categorizing open-text survey responses"}, {"title": "4.2 Automation of Generative Tasks", "content": "Definition. Generative tasks in political science involve creating synthetic data, simulating scenarios, or augmenting incomplete datasets, offering new insights where traditional data sources are either unavailable or insufficient [21, 142, 73, 141]. Unlike analytical tasks that focus on interpreting existing information, generative tasks expand the boundaries of what can be studied by creating representations of missing data or by projecting possible future scenarios [21, 142, 73]. Generative tasks are particularly valuable for political"}, {"title": "4.3 Simulation of LLM Agents", "content": "Definitions. The concept of Simulation Agents in LLM for political science refers to the use of large language models to create interactive environments in which autonomous agents simulate behaviors, decisions, or dialogues. These tasks aim to explore dynamic systems, such as political behaviors, negotiations, or conflicts, by modeling interactions between agents. While both Generative Tasks and Simulation Agents leverage LLMs, their objectives and methodologies are distinct. Generative tasks focus on creating new data or textual content to address data scarcity, enabling researchers to fill gaps or produce synthetic datasets for foundational analysis. In contrast, simulation agents emphasize modeling interactions and dynamics within complex environments, offering insights into strategies, behaviors, and evolving systems.\nThe use of LLMs to simulate human-like behavior in interactive environments represents a significant advancement in political science [147]. These simulations offer new ways to address complex societal questions, particularly those involving the behavior of political actors in intricate environments [270]. Traditional methods, such as Agent-Based Models (ABMs) [271], rely on predefined parameters and restricted environments, often limiting their capacity to capture the complexity and realism of political dynamics. LLMs overcome these constraints by using natural language prompts to define behavior rules and environmental contexts [148], allowing for adaptive, context-sensitive, and personalized agent behaviors [149]. Current research in this area"}, {"title": "4.4 LLM Explainability and Causal Inference", "content": "Definition of Explainability. Explainability in the context of LLMs refers to the ability to provide interpretable and understandable outputs that clarify how and why specific predictions or decisions are made. In politically sensitive applications, explainability ensures that stakeholders can trace model outputs to underlying reasoning processes, fostering trust and transparency. Interpretability is critical for validating insights derived from LLM analyses and ensuring fairness in decision-making for political science.\nDefinition of Causal Inference. Causal Inference is the process of identifying and understanding cause-and-effect relationships between variables. It goes beyond correlation by attempting to answer questions like \"What caused this outcome?\" or \"What would happen if a specific intervention were applied?\" In political science, causal inference is central to assessing the impact of policies, understanding voter behavior, and analyzing societal dynamics. LLMs offer new opportunities for causal inference tasks, enabling researchers to detect patterns, identify potential causal relationships, and generate counter-factuals.\nOne of the ultimate goals of science is to explain phenomena and uncover cause-and-effect relationships. In political science, causal inference plays a crucial role in understanding the impact of policies, campaigns, and social dynamics [156, 157, 158, 159]. While causal inference has been a focus in social and medical sciences [156], it has received comparatively less attention in computer science [156]. LLMs, with their remarkable capabilities in language generation and pattern recognition, provide new tools for enhancing causal inference. However, they also face significant limitations in moving beyond correlation to meaningful causal reasoning [273]. These challenges hinder their ability to provide deeper explanations of the phenomena they analyze, an essential requirement for advancing scientific understanding. Despite these limitations, recent research highlights the potential of LLMs to support causal inference-related tasks, providing tools for researchers to explore cause-and-effect relationships in innovative ways.\nExplainability of LLMs in Political Science. The explainability of LLMs, referring to the ability to generate interpretable insights, directly impacts their utility in causal inference [164]. Researchers can leverage explainability tools, such as attention mechanisms [165] and prompt engineering [166], to identify relevant variables and interactions within data. For instance, post-hoc analysis methods [167] enable researchers to interpret why an LLM has generated specific outputs, facilitating the identification of potential causal pathways in text-based datasets. This capability enhances the transparency and reliability of LLM-driven causal analysis, especially in politically sensitive contexts.\nApplications of LLM Causal Inference. Recent advancements demonstrate the potential of LLMs in identifying and modeling causal relationships. For example, LLMs have been utilized to detect causal patterns within large datasets, uncovering complex dependencies that traditional methods might overlook [159, 274]. By combining LLMs with domain expertise, researchers can identify key variables and interactions more effectively, leading to robust causal models. Another key application is the generation of counterfactual scenarios, which explore hypothetical outcomes under alternative conditions. LLMs can generate counterfactuals to assess the impact of different political policies or interventions, providing researchers with tools to test \"what-if\" scenarios [157, 160, 161]. Furthermore, LLMs have been employed to identify necessary and sufficient causes in controlled experimental settings, offering insights into the factors driving specific outcomes [159]. LLMs can also generate simulated datasets to evaluate causal inference methods. For instance, Gui and Toubi [162]"}, {"title": "4.5 Ethical Concerns in LLM Development and Deployment", "content": "General Concerns About Embedded Values in LLMs. Large language models are increasingly influencing societal and political discourse, raising fundamental questions about the values and biases they embed. The design and deployment of LLMs often involve implicit decisions about whose perspectives and moral frameworks are represented, potentially shaping public perception and decision-making in ways that are not always transparent. Johnson and Iziev [168] highlight the ethical dilemmas surrounding trust in AI-generated content, emphasizing the difficulty in ensuring that LLMs align with societal norms while avoiding the reinforcement of harmful biases. Similarly, Kim and Lee [169] examine the implications of LLM-driven conversational agents in political campaigns, noting the potential for these tools to inadvertently promote specific ideologies under the guise of neutrality. Lee et al. [170] further explore how LLMs reflect and propagate structural societal biases, particularly those affecting subordinate social groups. The study reveals that LLMs tend to portray these groups as more homogeneous, aligning with longstanding human cognitive biases, and underscores the importance of addressing such systemic issues in model training and evaluation. As LLMs continue to integrate into decision-making systems and public-facing applications, understanding their embedded values becomes imperative.\nSpecific Manifestations of Biases and Preferences in LLM Outputs. The outputs of LLMs often reflect biases and preferences that manifest in specific, measurable ways, influencing how these models are perceived and utilized across different contexts. These manifestations not only reveal the underlying training data biases but also highlight the importance of careful model deployment. For instance, Tornberg [32] provides a comprehensive analysis of ChatGPT's language use, showing how the model tends to favor Western-centric cultural norms and professional jargon. This skew has implications for accessibility and inclusivity, as it may alienate users from non-Western backgrounds or those with varying levels of language proficiency. In addition, Stanczak et al. [171] introduce a framework for quantifying biases in LLM outputs, with a focus on gender and occupational stereotypes. The study demonstrates that despite improvements in reducing overtly biased outputs, subtle biases persist, particularly in contexts where societal norms conflict with the training data distribution. Jiang et al. [172] also investigate how LLMs trained on community-specific data exhibit distinct preferences that align closely with the values and norms of those communities. While this approach can increase relevance"}, {"title": "4.6 Societal Impacts", "content": "Definitions and Context. The societal impacts of political-LLM sphere extend beyond technical concerns to encompass profound ethical, communicative, and informational implications. From influencing election outcomes to enhancing political communication, LLMs hold the potential to transform the societal landscape in both positive and negative ways. This section explores the multifaceted effects of LLMs on political campaigns, public communication, and civic engagement, while addressing potential risks and ethical challenges.\nTransforming Political Campaigns. LLMs have revolutionized the way political campaigns are conducted by enabling hyper-personalized messaging and voter targeting [175, 174, 155, 176, 177]. [175] is an early work which highlights the potential of LLMs in measuring populism, nationalism, and authoritarianism through automated analysis of U.S. presidential debates. Hackenburg [174] demonstrates how LLMs can analyze large datasets to generate messages tailored to individual voter profiles, influencing voter perceptions and potentially altering election outcomes. Beyond voter engagement, LLMs play a strategic role in shaping campaign narratives that resonate with diverse audiences. Moghimifar et al.[155] show that LLM-based agents can model political coalition negotiations, providing insights into political alliances and enabling more dynamic campaign strategies. Foos [176] discusses how generative AI tools, including LLMs, are transforming election campaigns by facilitating AI-to-voter conversations and enabling scalable, multilingual interactions under diverse democracies. Lately, Yu et al. [177] propose a novel multi-step reasoning framework using LLMs for U.S. election predictions, incorporating time-sensitive factors like candidates' policies and demographic trends to enhance accuracy. Together, these works showcase the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs in modernizing political campaigns and amplifying their impact across various dimensions.\nEnhancing Political Communication In an era of increasingly complex political discourses, LLMs offer tools to bridge the gap between policymakers and the public [178, 143, 26, 75, 179]. By simplifying intricate political and legislative content, LLMs make critical information more accessible to citizens, fostering greater political understanding and participation. Argyle et al. [178] discuss how LLMs can distill party manifestos into understandable summaries, addressing barriers that often hinder public engagement. Similarly, Alvarez et al. [143] highlight the potential of generative AI to enhance transparency and comprehension in elections, allowing voters to make more informed decisions. These advancements suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in democratizing information and improving the accessibility of political communication.\nDemocratizing Information Access. LLMs hold the promise of empowering individuals by breaking down complex topics into easily understandable language, thereby democratizing access to information. This capability can foster a more informed citizenry and enable greater accountability among political actors. By providing equitable access to political knowledge, LLMs ensure that more people, regardless of educational background, can participate in democratic processes. For instance, LLMs can assist in translating political jargon or simplifying policy discussions, helping individuals navigate traditionally opaque political systems. This democratization of information will lead to a more inclusive political landscape.\nEthical Risks. While LLMs offer substantial benefits, their societal deployment also raises critical ethical concerns. One major issue is the potential misuse of LLMs to disseminate misinformation or biased content, which could manipulate public opinion or destabilize democratic processes. Bai et al. [278] discuss the persuasive power of LLM-generated text in influencing political opinions, underscoring the need for safeguards to mitigate risks. Furthermore, the ability of LLMs to generate realistic but misleading content poses challenges in distinguishing fact from fiction, creating vulnerabilities for misinformation campaigns. Addressing these ethical challenges require robust governance frameworks and continuous monitoring."}, {"title": "5 Technical Foundations for LLM Applications in Political Science", "content": "To meet the specific demands of political science applications, various benchmark datasets grounded in real-world data have been developed to evaluate LLMs on tasks such as sentiment analysis, election prediction, legislative summarization, misinformation detection, and conflict resolution. Each dataset is designed with domain-specific criteria to assess the alignment of LLM outputs with real-world political and social contexts, ensuring their relevance and applicability to practical scenarios. A comprehensive list of these datasets, along with their respective tasks and charactristics, is presented in Table. 3 to facilitate reference and comparison."}, {"title": "5.1 Benchmark Datasets", "content": "Sentiment Analysis & Public Opinion Dataset. Various datasets have been developed to accurately assess LLMs in sentiment analysis and public opinion. For instance, OpinionQA [50] is designed as a test environment where LLMs answer questions about public opinion, capturing subtle sentiments across 1,489 well-crafted queries. This dataset is valuable because it benchmarks how closely LLMs can align with actual human opinion patterns\u2014a key factor for extracting sentiment accurately in social sciences. Similarly, PerSenT [180] focuses on tracking sentiments toward specific entities mentioned in news articles. It tests how well LLMs can detect and follow opinions expressed by particular individuals, allowing for sentiment to be aggregated over multiple mentions of popular entities to support comprehensive public opinion analysis. In addition, GermEval-2017 [181] provides a corpus of social media comments about Deutsche Bahn, the railway service in Germany, tailored for aspect-based sentiment analysis. This would help organizations and service providers derive actionable insights from feedback by homing in on specific aspects such as noise levels or punctuality. Datasets like Twitter [182], Bengali News Comments [183], and Indonesia News [184] extend the sentiment analysis to widely used social and news media platforms in multiple languages. These multilingual datasets are very important for cross-linguistic and cultural sentiment studies, which find specially relevant applications in global social media and market research.\nElection Prediction & Voting Behavior Dataset. The U.S. Senate Statewide 1976-2020 [279] dataset contains state-level election returns, while the U.S. House 1976-2022 [280] dataset provides district-level returns, offering resources for analyzing nearly five decades of electoral trends. Other than that, The U.S. Senate Returns 2020 [185] and U.S. House Returns 2018 [186] datasets offer detailed precinct-level voting data, allowing LLMs to analyze U.S. voting patterns and voter behavior with the highest granularity, which supports election prediction and voting behavior studies. The State Precinct-Level Returns 2018 dataset [187], with its extensive 10 million data points, provides a substantial resource for LLMs to train on and analyze voting behaviors comprehensively. The 2008 American National Election Study (ANES) [188] offers insights into voter preferences and political attitudes through surveys conducted before and after the election, capturing difference in voter sentiment, which LLMs can model to reflect public opinion changes. The U.S. President 1976-2020 dataset [190] provides historical data essential for LLMs to examine long-term political trends and election outcomes across multiple decades. These datasets serve as invaluable training sources for LLMs to support political campaigns, media analysis, and social science research into electoral behaviors and trends.\nLegislation & Administrative Rules Dataset. For summarizing and analyzing legislation and administrative rules, key datasets include BillSum [191], CaseLaw [192] and Federal Register [281]. BillSum aims at offering support to summarize US Congressional bills; it empowers LLMs to process mid-length legislative text and to produce brief summaries, which would considerably reduce the efforts of experts from the legal community and policy analysis. The CaseLaw dataset provides an extensive collection of state and federal cases, serving as a foundation for LLMs to analyze legal precedents and support judicial decision-making. The DEU III dataset [193] spans three decades of EU legislative decision-making, enabling the evaluation of LLMs in analyzing policy positions and negotiation dynamics among EU member states and institutions. Beyond legislation, the U.S. Federal Register dataset [281] includes titles and summaries of all final federal rules from 2000 to 2014,"}, {"title": "5.2 Dataset Preparation Strategies", "content": "Dataset preparation is a critical step in adapting LLMs for downstream political science applications [282"}]}

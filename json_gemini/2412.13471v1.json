However, the diverse nature of training data inevitably exposes LLM to misleading, harmful, and toxic content (Bai et al. 2022b; Ouyang et al. 2022), highlighting the critical importance of aligning these models with human values to mitigate potential negative impacts (Anwar et al. 2024; Barrett et al. 2023).\nCurrent alignment methods predominantly rely on external supervision or supervised fine-tuning. For example, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Achiam et al. 2023; Du et al. 2024) requires extensive human preference data and a two-stage training process, resulting in considerable costs. Other approaches, such as RLAiF (Lee et al. 2023), aim to reduce human supervision but still rely on advanced LLM, which are resource-intensive. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, including Aligner (Ji et al. 2024a) and PRO (Song et al. 2024), optimize LLM using preference loss functions, but these methods often constrain the model's ability to surpass human performance. Unlike these approaches, (Du et al. 2023) demonstrates that Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) enhances resource efficiency and creativity through interactions among multiple LLM. In MAD, agents collaboratively propose and refine responses, sharing both answers and historical data to jointly complete tasks. (Singhal et al. 2023) introduced a method that integrates multiple reasoning paths, optimizing answers through multi-round aggregation. Other approaches include one-on-one debates, synchronous discussions, summarizer-aided discussions (Chan et al. 2024), and self-collaboration via internal debates (Wang et al. 2024). (Liang et al. 2023) explores debates among agents with different personas, while (Li et al. 2024) highlights that existing MAD methods often employ fully connected communication, which may be less efficient than sparse communication.\nDespite the potential of MAD, its direct application in value alignment remains underexplored. The closest attempt, presented by (Pang et al. 2024), uses multiple agents to simulate social roles, yet it still relies on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and deviates from the traditional debate framework. Building on the strengths of MAD in enhancing resource efficiency and creativity, we seek to optimize value alignment through MAD. Specifically, we first theoretically investigate the relationship between debate outcomes and individual agent responses. Next, we explore how different communication methods affect debate efficiency. Finally, informed by these theoretical insights, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate framework based on Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication (GVIC).\nWe demonstrate that the usefulness and harmlessness of debate outcomes-two critical indicators in value alignment-are influenced by the upper bounds of usefulness and harmlessness within individual response spaces. Drawing inspiration from this observation, GVIC introduces a framework wherein a set of agents exhibit gradually varying levels of vigilance. This gradual vigilance enables different agents to perceive the same issue with a progressively distributed awareness. Each agent forms assumptions about the issue based on its vigilance level. For example, low-vigilance agents, assuming the issue is benign, focus on providing useful responses, thereby elevating the upper bound of usefulness. Conversely, high-vigilance agents, assuming the issue may carry potential risks, emphasize explaining possible hazards, thus raising the upper bound of harmlessness. As a result, by increasing the upper bounds of usefulness and harmlessness within individual responses, the overall usefulness and harmlessness of the debate outcomes are enhanced.\nFigure 1 presents a comparison between the classical debate framework and the GVIC framework. In the classical MAD approach, a fully connected communication method is typically employed, where all agents directly communicate with each other. Although this approach ensures comprehensive information sharing, it also leads to high communication overhead; excessively long inputs can hinder model comprehension (Li et al. 2024). In contrast, GVIC introduces interval communication, selectively engaging agents in the debate to reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, the responses of agents in GVIC follow a vigilance distribution from low to high. When adjacent agents communicate, their responses tend to be similar, which can diminish the effectiveness of the debate. Interval communication, however, selects agents with evenly spaced vigilance levels to participate in the debate, thereby maximizing the diversity of responses and enhancing the efficiency of the debate.\nFor comparison, Figure 2 illustrates the performance of a single agent, the classical Debate framework, and GVIC across various task types (harmlessness tasks, helpfulness tasks, and fraud detection tasks). In all tasks, GVIC consistently outperforms both the single agent (Single) and the classical Debate framework (Debate). Further experimental results demonstrate that GVIC not only excels on various public value alignment datasets but also consistently outperforms single agents and the classical Debate framework across different base model sizes, regardless of whether the base model is aligned. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication components.\nOur main contributions are as follows: (1) We theoretically explore the application of the MAD framework to value alignment, showing that the upper bounds of debate usefulness and harmlessness depend on those of individual responses. (2) Based on this, we propose the GVIC framework, incorporating Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication to improve value alignment. (3) We show that interval communication reduces overhead and enhances debate efficiency. (4) Experimental results confirm GVIC's broad applicability, consistently outperforming single models and the classical Debate framework across various value alignment tasks, regardless of base model size or alignment status."}, {"title": "Preliminary", "content": "This section introduces the foundational concepts of MAD within the context of value alignment and examines the relationship between debate outcomes and individual agent responses.\nMAD for Value Alignment. Consider N agent models, denoted as $A_1, A_2, ..., A_N$. For a given question q, model $A_k$ produces a response by the function $f_k(q)$:\n$r_k = f_k(q), \\forall k\\in \\{1,2,...,N\\}.$\nIn the value alignment process, usefulness and harmlessness are the two most critical metrics. We define the measurement functions for the usefulness and harmlessness of a response r as H(r) and S(r), respectively:\n$r^{(t+1)}_k = f_k (q | r^{(t)}_1, r^{(t)}_2, ..., r^{(t)}_N)$.\nHere, H(r) and S(r) quantify the response r in terms of its helpfulness and harmlessness, respectively:\n$H(r) = p\\{helpful | r\\},$\n$S(r) = p\\{harmless | r\\}.$\nOur objective is to maximize both the usefulness H(r) and harmlessness S(r) of the response to the question q. We define the balance value of the k-th agent in the t-th round as"}, {"title": "Relationships", "content": "Q^{(t)}_k = \\alpha H(r^{(t)}_k) + \\beta S(r^{(t)}_k),\nwhere \\alpha and \\beta are parameters that balance the importance of usefulness and harmlessness. In most cases, through multi-agent debate, the usefulness and harmlessness metrics are iteratively updated, gradually converging towards an optimal balance:\nQ^{(t+1)}_k \\geq Q^{(t)}_k.\nThe ultimate objective of the multi-agent debate process is to identify an optimal response r* that best balances usefulness and harmlessness:\nr^* = arg\\mathop{max}\\limits_{r_k \\in \\mathcal{R}_k} Q^{(t)}_k.\t\t\t\t\t(1)\nRelationship Between Debate Outcomes and Individual Responses. To analyze this relationship, we first introduce the concept of the response space. For a given question q, the response space of agent $A_k$ is defined as:\n\\mathcal{R}_k = \\{r^{[1]}_k, r^{[2]}_k,..., r^{[M]}_k\\},\nwhere $r^{[m]}_k$ denotes the m-th response of the k-th agent. The response space $\\mathcal{R}_k$ encompasses all M possible responses that agent $A_k$ can generate for question q. The upper bound of usefulness for agent $A_k$ is defined as:\nH^{max} = \\mathop{max}\\limits_m H(r^{[m]}_k).\nSimilarly, the upper bound of harmlessness is:\nS^{max} = \\mathop{max}\\limits_m S(r^{[m]}_k).\nAccording to Eq. 1, the upper bounds for the optimal response r* are:\nH(r^*) \\leq \\mathop{max}\\limits_k H^{max}, S(r^*) \\leq \\mathop{max}\\limits_k S^{max}.\nThis indicates that the usefulness and harmlessness of the optimal response are constrained by the upper bounds of the individual agents. For instance, if all models generate responses aligned with these values, it is challenging to achieve a response that violates them during the debate."}, {"title": "GVIC Framework", "content": "We begin by introducing the overall framework of GVIC, followed by a detailed discussion on the implementation of Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication.\nFigure 3 depicts the workflow of GVIC. The framework initially establishes a group of agents with varying levels of vigilance, denoted as agent $A_i$ for the i-th agent, where the vigilance level $v_i$ is set such that $\\forall i < j, v_i < v_j$. For example, the first agent may be configured with low vigilance, operating under the assumption that the issue is safe and prioritizing the provision of useful responses; the third agent may have medium vigilance, responding based on an unbiased assessment of the issue; and the sixth agent may be set with high vigilance, assuming the issue is harmful and focusing on ensuring the response is harmless."}, {"title": "Gradual Vigilance", "content": "Consider N agent models, denoted as $A_1, A_2, ..., A_N$, where the vigilance level of the k-th agent is $u_k$, satisfying $u_1 < u_2 < ... < u_N$. Vigilance reflects an agent's assumption about the potential risk posed by the issue: the higher the vigilance, the more likely the agent is to perceive the issue as a societal threat.\nFor instance, the low-vigilance agent $A_1$ assumes that \"truthfully answering the question is safe,\" leading $A_1$ to prioritize providing a \u201cuseful\u201d response. However, this may inadvertently increase the risk of producing a response with negative societal impacts. Conversely, the high-vigilance agent $A_N$ operates under the assumption that \u201ctruthfully answering the question may pose potential risks to society.\u201d This elevated vigilance prompts $A_N$ to focus on identifying potential harms and guiding the questioner towards appropriate values, albeit at the expense of the response\u2019s usefulness.\nGiven a question q, the model $A_k$ generates a response $r_k$, which can be represented by the function $f_k (q, v_k)$:\nr_k = f_k(q | v_k), \\forall k \\in \\{1,2,..., N\\}.\nThe objective is to maximize both the usefulness H(r) and harmlessness S(r) of the response. Based on the vigilance levels, for $\\forall i > j$:\nH(r_i) > H(r_j),\nS(r_i) < S(r_j).\nThe upper bound of usefulness $H^{max}$ is determined by $A_1$, while the upper bound of harmlessness $S^{max}$ is determined by $A_N$:\nH(r^*) \\propto H^{max}, S(r^*) \\propto S^{max}.\nThis suggests that incorporating agents with both low and high vigilance levels in the debate can extend the upper bounds of both usefulness and harmlessness for the optimal response, potentially leading to a response that is simultaneously more useful and harmless."}, {"title": "Interval Communication", "content": "In multi-agent communication, the classical MAD framework typically utilizes a fully connected communication method (Figure 4-(1)), where each agent can communicate with every other agent. However, this approach incurs prohibitively high communication costs (Li et al. 2024). The study by (Li et al. 2024) demonstrates that employing adjacent communication (Figure 4-(2)) can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining performance in tasks such as text reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and alignment labeling. Considering the Gradual Vigilance framework, we propose a more efficient interval communication method (Figure 4-(3)).\nSuppose there are N agents, and m agents participate in each communication round. Each agent communicates with m-1 other agents at a defined interval g, where the interval g is given by:\ng=\\lceil\\frac{N}{m}\\rceil\nFor each agent $A_k$, communication occurs with the following m 1 agents:\nA_k = \\{A_{(k+lg)\\%N} | l \\in \\{1,2,..., m \u2013 1\\}\\}.\nReducing Communication Overhead. The classical fully connected communication method (Figure 4-(1)) requires each agent to communicate with all other agents, resulting in a communication overhead of:\nC_{global} = O(N^2).\nIn contrast, the interval communication mechanism reduces this overhead by allowing each agent to communicate with only m 1 other agents, leading to a communication overhead of:\nC_{interval} = O(N \\cdot (m - 1)).\nGiven that $m\u226aN$, the interval communication mechanism significantly lowers the communication overhead. Specifically, when m = 3, the communication overhead for interval communication is equivalent to that of adjacent communication:\nC_{interval \\; m=3}= C_{neighbor} = O(2N)."}, {"title": "Improving Debate Efficiency", "content": "Improving Debate Efficiency. By setting the interval g in interval communication, each agent can interact with other agents that have significantly different vigilance levels, thereby enhancing debate efficiency. Within the interval communication framework, the response set referenced by agent $A_k$ is:\n\\mathcal{R}_k = \\{r_{(k+lg)\\%N} | l \\in \\{0,1,2, ..., m \u2013 1\\}\\}.\nThe agent then optimizes its response based on this set:\nr^{(t+1)}_k = f_k (q | \\mathcal{R}_k).\t\t\t\t\t(2)\nThe set $\\mathcal{R}_k$ contains responses generated by agents with varying levels of vigilance, enabling $A_k$ to draw from a diverse pool of responses, thereby enhancing the quality of its own response. Compared to adjacent communication, interval communication more effectively leverages the differences in vigilance among agents. For instance, with m = 3, whether employing adjacent communication or interval communication, three agents participate in each debate. In adjacent communication, the participating agents are:\n\\{r^{(t)}_k, r^{(t)}_{(k+1)\\%N}, r^{(t)}_{(k+2)\\%N}\\}.\nIn contrast, in interval communication, the participating agents are:\n\\{r_{(k+lg)\\%N} | l \\in \\{0,1,2\\}\\}.\nIt is clear that when the interval g > 1, the diversity of the latter set of responses is significantly greater than that of the former, allowing interval communication to achieve higher debate efficiency. Ultimately, as the debate progresses, all agents in interval communication can effectively engage with one another:\n\\cup_{k=1}^{N}\\{(k+lg)\\%N | l \\in \\{0,1,..., m\u22121\\}\\} = \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}."}, {"title": "Experimental Setup", "content": "Datasets. To evaluate the performance of GVIC and the baseline models across various tasks, we employed several representative public datasets, each tailored to specific research objectives: SAFE-RLHF (Ji et al. 2024b) is a dataset provided by PKU-Alignment, designed for research on value-aligned safety. It comprises 14 categories of harmful instructions, including those related to insults and privacy concerns. The Harmless, Helpful, and Red Team Attempts datasets were sourced from HH-RLHF (Bai et al. 2022a), a versatile dataset used for training and evaluating large language models. The Harmless dataset assesses a model's ability to avoid generating harmful content, the Helpful dataset measures the utility of responses, and the Red Team Attempts dataset evaluates the model's robustness against adversarial attacks. In our experiments, 100 questions were randomly sampled from each dataset for testing.\nModel Setup. To examine the performance of models with varying scales and alignment strategies, we selected several representative LLM as base models: For unaligned models, we utilized Wizard-Vicuna Uncensored 7B/13B/30B (Hartford 2024c,a,b). For aligned models, we selected Aligner 7B (Ji et al. 2024a) and GPT-3.5-Turbo 175B (Ouyang et al. 2022; Brown et al. 2020). As baseline models for comparison, we included both a single agent and the classical Debate framework (Du et al. 2023). In our experiments, the total number of agents participating in the debate was set to N = 5. For the GVIC framework, m = 3 agents were involved in each communication round, with a total of 3 rounds of debate.\nEvaluation Metrics. We employed GPT-4 as an evaluator to assess the performance of the models. From each dataset's test set, we randomly selected 100 samples to compare the responses generated by our models against those from the baseline models. For each question, the evaluator determined the outcome as either a Win, Tie, or Loss between the two responses. To mitigate positional bias, the order of the two responses was alternated (Zheng et al. 2024), and the results were averaged (Chiang et al. 2023; Khanov, Burapacheep, and Li 2024).\nTo quantify the relative performance of the models, we introduced a novel evaluation metric-the Win-Loss Differential Index:\nD_{WL} = \\frac{W-L}{W+T+L} \\times 100%,\t\t\t\t\t(3)\nwhere W, T, and L denote the number of Wins, Ties, and Losses, respectively. The index $D_{WL} \\in [-1,1]$ represents the net win rate of model\u2081 relative to model2. Unlike the simple win rate ($\\frac{W}{W+T+L}$), $D_{WL}$ accounts for both wins and losses, providing a more nuanced comparison of the two models' performances. A positive $D_{WL}$ indicates that model\u2081 outperforms model\u2082, while a negative $D_{WL}$ suggests the opposite. A value near zero implies that the models perform similarly. For instance, a $D_{WL}$ of 20% signifies that model\u2081 has a 20% net win advantage over model\u2082 in the overall evaluation."}, {"title": "Comparative Experiments", "content": "Table 1 presents the results of the comparative experiments conducted among the models. We evaluated the performance of GVIC, a single agent (Single), and the classical Debate framework (Debate) across five base models on four datasets.\nOverall, the GVIC framework demonstrates significant advantages over the baseline models across all tasks. In most cases, when compared to a single agent, GVIC shows a performance improvement typically ranging from 20% to 40%. Similarly, when compared to the classical Debate framework, the improvement generally falls between 15% and 35%.\nIn terms of specific task types, GVIC exhibits a substantial advantage in tasks related to harmlessness, as evidenced by the results on the SAFE-RLHF and Harmless datasets. For instance, on the Harmless dataset, using GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base model, GVIC's net win rate increased by 47% compared to the single agent and by 36% compared to the classical Debate framework. In the domain of fraud prevention, as evaluated on the Red Team Attempts dataset, GVIC also demonstrates a marked advantage. For example, with GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base model, GVIC's net win rate improved by 45% compared to the single agent and by 27% compared to the classical Debate framework. Regarding usefulness, as measured on the Helpful dataset, the advantages of GVIC and the classical Debate framework are less pronounced than in harmlessness and fraud prevention tasks. This is likely because the single agent is already proficient in generating relatively useful responses, thereby reducing the margin for improvement. Nevertheless, GVIC still shows notable gains: with GPT-3.5-Turbo as the base model, GVIC's net win rate increased by 22% compared to the single agent and by 10% compared to the classical Debate framework. Furthermore, factors such as model size and alignment status also influence performance improvements, which will be explored in greater detail in subsequent experiments.\nExperimental Details. Figure 5 illustrates the performance variation of GVIC and the classical Debate framework relative to a single agent as the debate progresses. Overall, both GVIC and the classical Debate framework enhance the performance of individual agents, with GVIC demonstrating greater efficiency in achieving these improvements. Additionally, the performance gains from multiple rounds of debate exhibit diminishing returns, suggesting that three rounds of debate generally offer an optimal balance between efficiency and performance enhancement. Regarding model size, its impact on performance improvement appears to be limited. The performance improvements observed in WV 13B (Wizard-Vicuna Uncensored 13B) and WV 30B are comparable, as are those between Aligner 7B and GPT-3.5-Turbo. In contrast, model alignment has a more pronounced effect: the aligned models, Aligner and GPT-3.5-Turbo, exhibit significantly better performance improvements compared to the unaligned models WV 13B and WV 30B."}, {"title": "Ablation Study", "content": "To further investigate the impact of Gradual Vigilance (GV) and Interval Communication (IC), we conducted an ablation study. In terms of agent configuration, we compared agents utilizing Gradual Vigilance with those that do not (where agents directly prioritize providing useful responses while ensuring harmlessness). For communication methods, we evaluated fully connected communication (FC) as used in the classical MAD framework, efficient neighboring communication (NC), and Interval Communication (IC) as employed in GVIC. To ensure fairness, the number of agents participating in each communication round for IC was set to m = 3, consistent with NC."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "LLM Alignment. Aligning large language models with human values is essential for mitigating potential societal harm. Traditional approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Achiam et al. 2023; Du et al. 2024; Ouyang et al. 2022) fine-tune models using human preference data to optimize outputs toward desired behaviors. However, RLHF presents challenges, including complexity and inefficiency in training. To address these issues, alternatives like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2024) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RHFF) (Yuan et al. 2024) have been proposed. These methods streamline the RLHF process by reducing or eliminating the reliance on reward models, thereby lowering computational costs. Other approaches, such as RLAiF (Lee et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2024), bypass human supervision but require more advanced LLM, which also increases computational expenses. Beyond RLHF, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is widely used to align LLM with human preferences. SFT simplifies the training process by avoiding the complex reward model designs inherent in RLHF. For example, (Liu, Sferrazza, and Abbeel 2024) proposed an SFT method using antonym templates to guide models in generating semantically opposing suffixes, thereby enhancing understanding. Similarly, methods like Aligner (Ji et al. 2024a) and PRO (Song et al. 2024) fine-tune LLM using preference loss functions to better align them with human values. Despite these advancements, both RLHF and SFT tend to constrain the model's potential, making it challenging to achieve superhuman performance.\nLLM Debate. In contrast to RLHF and SFT, the MAD framework leverages interactions among multiple LLM to enhance resource efficiency and foster creativity. For instance, (Du et al. 2023) proposed a cooperative approach where agents share answers and history records to collectively accomplish tasks. (Singhal et al. 2023) introduced the integration of multiple reasoning paths, optimizing answers through multi-round aggregation to improve both accuracy and consistency. Another approach by (Wang et al. 2023) suggested sampling multiple reasoning paths independently and selecting the most frequent answer to enhance consistency. This strategy was further extended by (Singhal et al. 2023), who utilized multi-round aggregation to improve answer accuracy. (Chan et al. 2024) explored different debate modes, including one-on-one, synchronous discussion, and synchronous discussion with a summarizer, allowing agents to asynchronously generate responses. Additionally, (Wang et al. 2024) proposed that a single agent could simulate an internal debate, akin to self-cooperation, while (Liang et al. 2023) suggested introducing agents with different personalities to foster divergent reasoning paths. However, the direct application of MAD in value alignment remains relatively unexplored. The closest work is (Pang et al. 2024), which simulates social roles through multiple agents to study their societal impact. However, this method still relies on SFT techniques for training and is not a typical debate process. Moreover, its dependence on predefined roles may expose it to vulnerabilities like role fraud."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This paper explored the application of MAD in value alignment, demonstrating how the usefulness and harmlessness of debate outcomes are influenced by the capabilities of individual responses.

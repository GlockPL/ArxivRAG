In this paradigm, speech signals are discretized into token sequences, which are modeled by an LLM with text as prompts and reconstructed by a token-based vocoder to waveforms. Obviously, speech tokens play a critical role in LLM-based TTS models. Current speech tokens are learned in an unsupervised manner, which lacks explicit semantic information and alignment to the text. In this paper, we propose to represent speech with supervised semantic tokens, which are derived from a multilingual speech recognition model by inserting vector quantization into the encoder. Based on the tokens, we further propose a Codec-based synthesizer for Voice generation, CosyVoice\u00b9, which consists of an LLM for text-to-token generation and a conditional flow matching model for token-to-speech synthesis. Experimental results show that supervised semantic tokens significantly outperform existing unsupervised tokens in terms of content consistency and speaker similarity for zero-shot voice cloning. Moreover, we find that utilizing large-scale data further improves the synthesis performance, indicating the scalable capacity of CosyVoice.

At the forefront of this advancement are Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been increasingly utilized in TTS systems to generate speech with a higher degree of naturalness and the ability to synthesize voices in a zero-shot fashion (Betker, 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Lajszczak et al., 2024). These LLM-based TTS models function by converting speech signals into sequences of tokens, with the LLM utilizing text as a condition to model these token sequences. A token vocoder is then employed to reconstruct the raw waveforms from the tokenized speech (Kong et al., 2020; D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022).\nA critical aspect of the TTS process is the representation of speech tokens. Traditionally, tokens are acquired through unsupervised learning, which may not capture explicit semantic information or align well with corresponding text (Hsu et al., 2021; D\u00e9fossez et al., 2022). Recognizing this gap, our work introduces supervised semantic tokens extracted from a multilingual speech recognition model, Whisper (Radford et al., 2023), by integrating vector quantization into the encoder. This innovation allows for more accurate semantic representation and alignment with text. Early studies have shown that quantizers with auxiliary automatic speech recognition (ASR) loss outperform k-means clustering on the universal speech model (USM) for speech-to-text translation and ASR tasks, as demonstrated in Rubenstein et al. (2023). Additionally, Ye et al. (2024) employed Gumbel-Softmax vector quantization to extract discrete speech representations that prioritize ASR-relevant information for ASR tasks. However, the impact of these approaches on text-to-speech (TTS) remains unclear.\nFurthermore, leveraging these supervised tokens, we propose CosyVoice, a scalable and efficient zero-shot TTS synthesizer. CosyVoice is comprised of an LLM for converting text into semantic token sequences and a conditional flow matching model for the subsequent synthesis of speech from these tokens. In contrast to prior systems like TorToise TTS (Betker, 2023), which employs an LLM in"}, {"title": "2 CosyVoice: A Scalable TTS model using Supervised Semantic Tokens", "content": "conjunction with a denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) (Ho et al., 2020), CosyVoice utilizes a conditional flow matching approach, as it has been demonstrated to accelerate both training and inference compared to traditional diffusion models (Le et al., 2024). While existing methods incorporate flow matching in TTS (Le et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2023; Mehta et al., 2023; Guan et al., 2023), they often rely on phoneme duration prediction, necessitating the use of supplementary phonemizers and forced aligners. CosyVoice, however, bypasses these dependencies, offering a more direct and efficient pathway from text to speech.\nOur research contributes to the field of speech generation in several novel ways:\n\u2022 We are the first to integrate supervised speech tokens into TTS models, enhancing content consistency and speaker similarity in zero-shot voice cloning.\n\u2022 We propose CosyVoice, a scalable zero-shot TTS synthesis system that combines an LLM for text-to-token generation with a conditional flow matching model for token-to-speech synthesis, forsaking the need for additional phonemizers and forced aligners.\n\u2022 To further refine the quality of generated speech, we incorporate the x-vector (Snyder et al., 2018) into the LLM to separate the modeling of speech into semantic, speaker, and prosody components. The LLM models the semantic content and prosody, while the conditional flow matching model captures timbre and environmental information. We optimize the flow matching process with techniques such as classifier-free guidance (Ho and Salimans, 2022a), a cosine scheduler, and masked conditions.\nOur experimental results demonstrate the superiority of supervised semantic tokens over unsupervised counterparts. Additionally, the scalability of CosyVoice is evidenced by improved synthesis performance when utilizing large-scale data. This work, therefore, represents a significant step forward in the development of natural-sounding, versatile TTS systems."}, {"content": "As shown in Figure 1(b), our Cosy Voice consists of four components, namely text encoder, speech tokenizer, large language model and conditional flow matching model. Specifically, the text encoder is used to align the semantic spaces of text and speech tokens, while the speech tokenizer is utilized to extract semantic tokens as illustrated in Figure 1(a). We employ a large language model to learn the whole sequence of text encodings and speech tokens, reformulating TTS as an auto-regressive sequence generation problem given text as prompts. Then, as shown in Figure 1(c), a conditional flow matching model is utilized to convert speech tokens into a Mel spectrogram via a denoising process on the optimal path. To obtain a perceptible signal, the HifiGAN vocoder (Kong et al., 2020) is used to synthesize a waveform with the generated Mel spectrogram as input."}, {"title": "2.1 Supervised Semantic Tokens for Speech", "content": "In CosyVoice, a supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) model is employed to derive the supervised semantic speech (S3) tokenizer for speech. The model is a finetuned version of our proprietary Sense Voice ASR model. It is trained on multilingual audio data and possesses rich audio content understanding capabilities. Different from the original ASR model, we split the encoder into two parts and insert a vector quantization layer between them. Given a Mel spectrogram X as input, it undergoes the positional encoding and Encoder\u2081 to obtain a context-aware representations H:\n$H = Encoder_1(PosEnc(X))$       (1)\nThen, a vector quantizer (VQ) is involved to obtain discrete tokens.

The corresponding codebook embeddings of speech tokens are used as the quantized hidden representations $H = {C_{\u03bc1}, C_{\u03bc2},..., C_{\u03bc_L}}$ and passed through the remaining encoder layers Encoder2:\n$H = Encoder_2(PosEnc(H))$  (4)"}, {"title": "2.2 Large Language Model for TTS", "content": "Note that, before the remaining encoder layers, we add an extra positional encoding to enhance the temporal information.

At the training stage, we employ the teacher-forcing scheme, in which the left-shifted sequence is employed as the mode inputs and the original sequence serves as the expected outputs. Note that only the cross entropy losses of speech tokens and $\\bar{E}$ are considered during the training:\n$L_{LLM} =  -\\frac{1}{L+1} \\sum_{l=1}^{L+1} log q(\u03bc_l)$   (8)\nwhere $\u03bc_{L+1}$ is the \u201cend of sequence\" token $\\bar{E}$. q(\u03bcl) denotes the posterior probability of \u03bcl, which is predicted by the softmax layer following LLM.\nIn CosyVoice, an optimal-transport conditional flow matching model (OT-CFM) is employed to learn the distribution of Mel spectrogram and generate samples from it with generated speech tokens as conditions. OT-CFM can achieve better performance compared to diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) with simpler gradients, easier training and faster generation (Lipman et al., 2023; Tong et al., 2023; Mehta et al., 2023). In continuous-time normalizing flows (CNFs), a probability density path is constructed from a prior distribution p0(X) to the data distribution of Mel spectrogram q(X)."}, {"title": "2.3.1 Zero-shot In-context Learning", "content": "The probability density path is defined by a time-dependent vector field vt(X) : [0, 1] \u00d7 RL\u2217D \u2192 RL\u2217D, which generates the flow \u03a6t through the following ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$\\frac{d}{dt} \u03a6_t(X) = v_t(\u03a6_t(X), t)$\n$\u03a6_0(X) \u223c p_0(X) = N(X; 0, I)$\n$\u03a6_1(X) \u223c p_1(X)$  (9)\nwhere t \u2208 [0, 1]. By solving the initial value problem Eq. (9), we can approximate the speech distribution q(X) with p1(X) and sample from it. To learn the vector field vt(X), we define the optimal-transport (OT) flow and force a neural network to match it by minimizing the following loss:\n$L_{OT-CFM} = E_{t, p_0(X_0), q(X_1)} [||w_t(\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1)|X_1)  - v_t(\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1)|\u03b8)||^2]$   (10)\nwhere\n$\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1) = (1 - (1-\u03c3)t)X_0 + tX_1$\n$w_t(\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1)|X_1) = X_1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c3)X_0$   (11)\nThe speaker embedding v, speech tokens {\u03bcl}1:L, and masked Mel spectrogram X1 are also fed into the neural network to match the vector field with learnable parameters \u03b8:\n$v_t(\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1)|\u03b8) = NN_\u03b8 (\u03a6_t^{OT}(X_0, X_1), t; v, \\{\u03bc_l\\}_{1:L}, X_1)$  (12)\nX1 is a masked version of X1 by setting continuous frames to zeros from a random start point to the end.

Therefore, we propose to adapt the CFG into conditional flow matching models.

This process entails the careful construction of input sequences for the token language model (LM), depicted in Figure 2. For prompt speech and input text in the same language, we merge them to form a unified input, treating the prompt speech tokens as pre-generated. With this input sequence, the autoregressive LM iteratively predicts subsequent tokens until it encounters the \u201cend of sequence\u201d token $\\bar{E}$. However, when the prompt speech and input text differ linguistically, we omit the text and tokens associated with the prompt to prevent prosodic characteristics of the original language from influencing the target language. It is important to note that the prompt text, which corresponds to the prompt speech's content, can be transcribed either through human annotation or ASR models, such as SenseVoice. Similar to the prompt text, the prompt tokens are extracted from the prompt speech with S\u00b3 tokenizer.\nAfter generating the speech tokens, they are appended after the prompt tokens, forming a composite condition for the flow-matching model.

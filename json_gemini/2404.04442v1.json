The\ngenesis of autonomous agents is rooted in early conceptualizations of self-\ngoverning systems capable of intentional action in the physical world[2]. This\nparadigm has found applications across a spectrum of fields, from cognitive\nscience to economics. The evolution of autonomous agents has seen signif-\nicant strides, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) marking a\npivotal moment in our pursuit of artificial intelligence that mirrors human\ncognition[1]. The ripple effects of automation on society are far-reaching. It\nhas catalyzed the emergence of novel work methodologies and has reshaped\nsocietal constructs. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the existence of an\n\"automation gap\". The reality is that not all tasks are amenable to au-\ntomation, and in such instances, human intervention remains indispensable\nto fuel the engine of innovation[4]. The dawn of automation has revolution-\nized the work landscape. While it has amplified productivity, it has also\nmarginalized less-educated workers and augmented the monopoly rents ac-\ncrued by capital owners. Interestingly, even occupations at the top of the\neconomic pyramid, such as financial managers, physicians, and senior execu-\ntives, encompass a significant proportion of activities that are susceptible to\nautomation[5]. While automation has been a catalyst for economic growth,\nit has concurrently widened the chasm of wealth inequality. The fruits of\nautomation are not equitably distributed, and the wealth generated often\ngravitates toward the upper echelons of society[6]. This has ignited discourse\non the societal ramifications of automation and the imperative for policy\ninterventions to ensure equitable wealth distribution. The amalgamation of\nlarge language models with autonomous agents offers a promising frontier for\nenhancing simulation capabilities[7]. LLMs, endowed with a wealth of web\nknowledge, have shown extraordinary promise in approximating human-level\nintelligence [1]. This has spurred a surge in research exploring the potential\nof LLM-based autonomous agents[3].\nLLMs, being trained on extensive internet data, encapsulate a substantial\ncorpus of human knowledge. This mirrors the Semantic Web's objective of\nrendering internet data machine-readable[8], thereby forging a web of data\namenble to machine processing. The interaction dynamics between humans\nand LLMs are crucial. The manner in which we query or prompt these models\ncan significantly shape the responses. This brings into focus the strategy of\nprompt tuning, a technique employed to enhance LLM performance by care-\nfully selecting and adjusting prompts or seed texts to guide the model's gen-\nerated text[9][10].

T5[23]\nand BART[24] are notable models that employ this architecture.\nEncoder-only: This architecture is employed when the task requires\nonly the encoding of the input sequence, eliminating the need for a decoder.\nThe input sequence is encoded into a fixed-length representation, which is\nthen used as input to a classifier or a regressor for prediction. BERT[25],\nDistilBERT[26], and RoBERTa[27] are models that utilize this architecture.\nDecoder-only: This architecture comprises solely a decoder, which is\ntrained to predict the subsequent token in a sequence given the preceding\ntokens. The key distinction between the Decoder-only and the Encoder-\nDecoder architectures is that the former lacks an explicit encoder to summa-\nrize the input information.\nFigure 1 presents the Architecture of the Transformer model. Trans-\nformers have outperformed Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in numerous\naspects. RNNs process data sequentially[28], resulting in slower processing\ntimes and limited capabilities, particularly with longer data sequences. In\ncontrast, transformers process sentences in their entirety rather than word\nby word, enabling parallel computation and reducing training time. Further-\nmore, transformers are built on the concept of self-attention, allowing the\nmodel to assign importance to different words in a sentence based on their\nrelevance to each other."}, {"title": "The Evolution of Large Language Models", "content": "The Evolution and Development of LLMs The genesis of LLMs can be traced\nback to early research in natural language processing and machine learning.\nHowever, their rapid evolution was sparked by the advent of deep learning"}, {"title": "Building Autonomous Agents with Large\nLanguage Models", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) employ a diverse memory architecture, pri-\nmarily utilized to store the model's parameters and intermediate computa-\ntional activations.

To efficiently manage this, some systems adopt techniques inspired by\nclassical virtual memory and paging methodologies prevalent in operating\nsystems.\nWhen designing memory systems, engineers frequently draw inspiration\nfrom nature. Neural networks, a prominent example of biological systems in-\nspiring computer algorithms, were initially mathematically conceptualized as\na system of simplistic neurons capable of executing simple logical operations[45].\nCognitive psychology provides foundational frameworks, such as Baddeley's\nmulti-component working memory model, which have been pivotal in under-\nstanding human memory [46]. Certain LLMs employ memory management\ntechniques inspired by operating systems. For instance, PagedAttention[47],\nan attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging\ntechniques in operating systems, has been proposed to manage the key-value\ncache memory in LLMs.\nThe memory complexity in LLMs is a consequence of their design. In\ntransformer-based LLMs, the memory requirement escalates quadratically\nwith the input sequence length due to the self-attention mechanism in trans-\nformers computing pairwise interactions between all tokens in the input.\nIn the realm of LLM memory management, memories are typically or-\nganized in hierarchies.

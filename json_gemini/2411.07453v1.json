Therefore, accurate and timely fault diagnosis of nuclear\npower systems is of great significance for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants. The existing fault\ndiagnosis methods mainly target a single device or subsystem, making it difficult to analyze the inherent connections and\nmutual effects between different types of faults at the entire unit level. This article uses the AP1000 full-scale simulator to\nsimulate the important mechanical component failures of some key systems in the primary and secondary circuits of nuclear\npower units, and constructs a fault dataset. Meanwhile, a hierarchical multi granularity classification fault diagnosis model\nbased on the EfficientNet large model is proposed, aiming to achieve hierarchical classification of nuclear power faults. The\nresults indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis model can effectively classify faults in different circuits and system compo-\nnents of nuclear power units into hierarchical categories. However, the fault dataset in this study was obtained from a simulator,\nwhich may introduce additional information due to parameter redundancy, thereby affecting the diagnostic performance of the\nmodel.", "sections": [{"title": "EfficientNet", "content": "EfficientNet applies an efficient\nconvolutional neural network architecture to achieve\nefficient model design by uniformly scaling the depth,\nwidth and resolution of the network, thereby reducing\nthe number of calculations and parameters while main-\ntaining accuracy.

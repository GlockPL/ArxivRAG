Traditional methods for monitoring are often time-consuming, expensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for large-scale applications, highlighting the need for accurate and efficient automated systems. In this study, we evaluate several state-of-the-art CNN models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, and Efficient Net, using three transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach, to classify eleven harmful phytoplankton genera from microscopic images. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50 using the fine-tuning approach, with an accuracy of 96.97%.

Introduction", "content": "Phytoplankton serves as a vital foundation for life in aquatic ecosystems and plays a key role in energy transfer within the aquatic food web (Rachman et al. 2022). Plankton is responsible for producing approximately 90% of the Earth's oxygen, making its low levels a threat to ocean ecosystems. Conversely, excessive plankton growth can have destructive consequences due to toxin production (Zhao et al. 2010).\nDue to its rapid response and high sensitivity to environmental changes, many phytoplankton species are used as indicators of environmental health such as global warming (Lumini & Nanni 2019). The growth rate, the cell shape, and other metabolites can indicate various anomalies in the water, such as eutrophication. Additionally, certain phytoplankton species tend to proliferate rapidly under abnormal water conditions, leading to harmful algal blooms (HABs), which can have severe impacts on the ecosystem, particularly if the blooming species are toxin producers (Suthers et al. 2019). Furthermore, harmful phytoplankton species such as Aphanizomenon, Microcystis, Anabaena, and Oscillatoria are common cyanobacteria (Paerl et al.2001), some of which produce hepatotoxins and neurotoxins that pose direct threats to water supplies and the safety of both animals and humans.\nStudying and monitoring plankton distribution and particularly harmful phytoplankton is crucial for the maintenance of the aquatic ecological environment, global climate regulation, and environmental protection. Traditional algae monitoring methods rely on highly experienced professionals, making them time-consuming, costly, error-prone, and often impractical for large-scale use (Yang et al. 2023). As a result, researchers are increasingly turning to automated approaches for plankton classification using computer vision techniques. Several studies have leveraged deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate plankton image acquisition, identification, and enumeration (Rachman et al. 2022). For instance, Yang et al. (2023) employed models such as AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 to identify harmful phytoplankton, while Rachman et al. (2022) utilized VGG16 to classify various phytoplankton species. Additionally, Figueroa et al. (2024) applied Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet for detecting freshwater phytoplankton, and Kyathanahally et al. (2021) used multiple CNN models with ensemble learning to recognize zooplankton in lakes.\nThe primary objective of this study is to develop an automated system for recognizing toxic phytoplankton using several state-of-the-art CNN models, including ResNet, ResNeXt, DenseNet, and Efficient Net. We also evaluate three different transfer learning approaches: linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 details the experimental setup, Section 3 presents the experimental results, and Section 4 provides a summary of the study."}, {"title": "2. Experiment", "content": "In this section, we present the phytoplankton dataset, as well as the different learning approaches used to develop the automatic system for phytoplankton recognition, finally, we present the metrics used for model evaluation."}, {"title": "2.1. Data Acquisition", "content": "In this study, we utilized a publicly available dataset of phytoplankton (Yang et al. 2023). This dataset includes eleven common harmful phytoplankton genera, encompassing a total of 1650 images, both original and augmented (see Fig. 1). Each class is represented by 150 RGB images, which were resized to 224x224 pixels. The dataset used in this study was downloaded from the web page (the-algae-cell-images). \u03a4\u03bf perform the experiment, the dataset was partitioned into three subsets: (1) training data for model parameter optimization, (2) validation data to select the best model configuration and avoid overfitting, and (3) test data to evaluate the model generalization performance."}, {"title": "2.2. Experimental Design", "content": "In this study, we employed transfer learning to develop an automatic phytoplankton recognition system (see Fig. 2). We explored three distinct learning approaches: (1) Linear Probing, where the model backbone was frozen, and only the classifier head (i.e., the final classification layer) was trained for 100 epochs (Fig. 2a). (2) Fine-Tuning, where both the backbone and the classifier head were trained for 100 epochs (Fig. 2b). (3) Combined Approach, which integrates both linear probing and fine-tuning into a two-stage process. Initially, the model was trained with linear probing for 50 epochs at an initial learning rate of 0.001, followed by fine-tuning for an additional 50 epochs at a reduced learning rate of 0.0001 (Fig. 2c).\nFor this experiment, we evaluated several CNN backbones, varying batch sizes and initial learning rates. All models were pretrained on ImageNet using the Adam optimizer, with their classifier heads adapted to address our multiclass classification problem involving eleven classes."}, {"title": "2.3. Model Evaluation", "content": "To evaluate the overall performance of the model, we employed three metrics: precision (1) to measure the accuracy of the model in recognizing different phytoplankton genera, recall (2) to assess the model's effectiveness in retrieving instances of each genus, and accuracy (3), which indicates the proportion of correctly classified images relative to the total number of images.\nPrecision = $\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$\nRecall = $\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$\nAccuracy = $\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$"}, {"title": "3. Results and Discussion", "content": "Fig. 3 shows the validation results of training the ResNet-50 model using a transfer learning approach with a combined strategy, evaluated across various batch sizes (4, 8, 16, 32, and 64). The optimal performance, with an accuracy of 95.3%, was achieved using a batch size of 8 images.\nTable 1 displays the validation results of training the ResNet-50 model with a batch size of 8 images across three different learning approaches, each with varying initial learning rates. The highest performance, with an accuracy of 95.97%, was obtained using the fine-tuning approach with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. Table 2 presents the test results for various CNN backbones trained using the fine-tuning approach with a batch size of 8 images and an initial learning rate of 0.0001. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50, which attained an accuracy of 96.97%, a precision of 96.99%, a recall of 96.97%, and a training time of 18.51 minutes.\nFig. 4 illustrates the test performance of the top-performing model, ResNet-50, across various phytoplankton genera. The model achieved an accuracy of 100% for all genera except Oscillatoria, which had an accuracy of 85.71%, Aphanizomenon with 90.32%, Nodularia at 93.33%, and Anabaena with 96.77%.\nFig. 5 presents the confusion matrix for the top-performing model on the test data, highlighting several points of confusion: Aphanizomenon is often misclassified as Nodularia, Nodularia is frequently mistaken for Oscillatoria, and Oscillatoria is commonly confused with both Aphanizomenon and Anabaena. This is primarily due to the similar morphological patterns of these four genera of phytoplankton."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we evaluated six CNN architectures (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, ResNeXt-50, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B0) using three transfer learning approaches-linear probing, fine-tuning, and a combined approach to classify eleven harmful phytoplankton genera from a publicly available benchmark dataset of microscopic images. The best performance was achieved by ResNet-50 with the fine-tuning approach, yielding an accuracy of 96.97%. However, the models had difficulty distinguishing between four phytoplankton types with similar morphological characteristics. The proposed system offers a valuable tool for experts by automating species identification and reducing manual effort. Nonetheless, the development of a more comprehensive dataset encompassing a wider range of harmful phytoplankton is recommended to support the creation of more general models for water quality monitoring."}]}

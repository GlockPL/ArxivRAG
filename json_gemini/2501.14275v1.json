However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability.

Math reasoning is perhaps one of the most challenging tasks for the LLMs, since mathematics is inherently structured, requiring not just recall of facts but also rigorous logical inference, abstraction, and understanding of formal symbolic systems. As such, there have been grand challenges (Selsam et al., 2019) and million-dollar prizes AIMO (2023) established for a model capable of solving Olympiad-level math problems.\nOn the training side, despite significant progress in certain areas, such as geometry, particularly with the assistance of symbolic methods (Trinh et al., 2024), the performance of LLMs remains limited on Olympiad-level problems (He et al., 2024). One of the key challenges in advancing competition-level math reasoning, compared to other domains like coding or grade-school math, is"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we provide an overview of the existing mathematical datasets used for evaluation and training purposes.

These datasets typically contain math problems ranging from middle-school to high-school level, providing broad coverage across various problem categories.

We begin by collecting raw discussions from the forum website, where each discussion is called a \"topic\". In these topics, the author presents math problems (e.g., competition-level problems) or general questions, such as seeking advice or resources. Our raw dataset consists of 1,076, 712 topics. Topics posted up until December 2023 are used as the training set, while those posted between January and August 2024 are reserved as the evaluation dataset.\nStep 1: Math Question Detection. We then filter out irrelevant topics, specifically those not containing a mathematical question. To achieve this, we use Qwen 2.5 14B (Yang et al., 2024a) to decide the relevance of each topic. The first post of each topic determines whether the topic is a mathematical question or not, so we manually design a few-shot prompt, provide the first post of the"}, {"title": "Step 2: Question-Answer Extraction.", "content": "After filtering, we extract the math question from the first post of each topic and identify potential solutions provided in subsequent posts. Since this task requires understanding the entire conversation and determining which responses contain valid solutions, we employ the 70B variant of Llama 3.1 for this step, enabling the detection of both the question and all relevant answers from the discussion."}, {"title": "Step 3: Solution rewriting.", "content": "Math solutions generated by users on the AOPS forum are often concise, omitting details assumed to be common knowledge among the target audience. For instance, a user might write $(x + yz)/2 \\geq \\sqrt{xyz}$ without explicitly mentioning the application of the AM-GM inequality to $(x, yz)$. While such brevity is typical for expert-level discussions, LLMs trained on these succinct solutions often struggle to maintain their chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities.\nOur experiments show that fine-tuning a model on these concise solutions significantly degrades its performance on standard benchmarks (see Section 4.4 and Figure 5b). To address this issue, we utilize the Qwen 2.5 72B model (Yang et al., 2024b) to rewrite all solutions into detailed, step-by-step explanations. This approach aligns with similar techniques used in prior work, such as the Numina project (Li et al., 2024), which also employed solution rewriting to improve response quality. An example of a rewritten solution is provided in Figure 3, and the overall dataset curation process is illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"title": "Step 4: Data Decontamination.", "content": "After processing all the QA pairs, we apply data decontamination to remove any overlap with the test sets of commonly used math benchmarks. Following the approach used in DeepSeekMath (Shao et al., 2024), we employ a 10-gram exact match decontamination (Zhuo et al., 2024) method to ensure that our dataset remains distinct from those benchmarks."}, {"title": "3.2 CONTAMINATION-RESISTANT EVALUATION: LIVEAOPSBENCH", "content": "Math LLMs are trained on large instructional corpora. A common issue with current evaluation sets is the risk of contamination, where test samples may inadvertently overlap with training data. To create contamination-resistant benchmarks, we constructed our evaluation set by sorting the raw data based on the initial posting timestamp and including only the most recent entries. Our evaluation set, denoted as LiveAoPSBench, is sourced from the AoPS forum, with posts strictly between January 2023 and September 2024. We utilize the same pre-processing pipeline, depicted in Figure 2, to extract QA pairs and have the raw solutions rewritten for consistency.\nFiltering. The correctness of the solution is typically verified by comparing the final answer to the human-annotated answer. Note that human-annotated answers may still contain errors, as we do not perform formal proofs or verification. When constructing an evaluation set, it is essential that each question has a concrete and definite answer, which is enclosed as `ans` format for ease of parsing, as illustrated in Figure 3. We start by applying a series of heuristic filters to exclude proof-based questions and extract only those with explicit, boxed answers. To ensure that our test set does not contain problems included in widely used training sets, we use an stricter 8-gram matching filter-stricter compared to the 10-gram filter used for training set decontamination. This helps eliminate any potential overlap with common training corpora (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Cobbe et al., 2021; Mitra et al., 2024).\nCross-Check by LLMs. A key challenge in building a fair evaluation set is ensuring the accuracy and validity of QA pairs. To automate this process, we employed two different models-Llama3.1-70B-Ins (Dubey et al., 2024) and Qwen2.5-72B-Ins (Yang et al., 2024a) to perform the rewriting step twice for each question.

This translates to more than 1,000 monthly questions, which shows the potential of the AoPS forum to be used as training, and especially evaluation set. Figure 4c shows a breakdown of the types of questions in our dataset. Proof questions and numerical questions with about 32% and 28% constitute the majority of the questions in our dataset.\nFinally, Figure 4d shows the pairwise overlap between each pair of popular supervised fine-tuning datasets using substring matching between the two datasets of each pair.

By developing a scalable and automated pipeline for extracting and refining question-answer pairs, this work presents a dataset containing over 600, 000 QA pairs, along with an up-to-date, contamination-resistant evaluation benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements across multiple standard benchmarks for models fine-tuned on the AoPS-Instruct, highlighting enhanced mathematical reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the observed performance decline of various LLMs on LiveAoPSBench underscores the importance of continuously updating evaluation sets to mitigate the risks of data contamination.\nFor future work, there are several promising directions to explore. First, while this paper focuses on the AoPS forum, the pipeline developed is not limited to this domain. It is generalizable and can be applied to other online forums or different subject areas, enabling the creation of high-quality datasets for various fields, such as physics, computer science, or even non-technical disciplines. Expanding this pipeline to other knowledge-intensive communities could further improve the training and evaluation of LLM across disciplines. Additionally, the quality of the dataset can be significantly improved by incorporating more advanced LLMs into the pipeline. Leveraging state-of-the-art models for question extraction, answer detection, and solution rewriting would result in more accurate and detailed data, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the fine-tuned models. Moreover, the problems is AoPS-Instruct could be used as a diverse set to distill larger models into smaller models.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Climate time-series forecasting is essential for understand-\ning and predicting environmental phenomena, which has sig-\nnificant implications for public health [1], resource man-\nagement [2], and policy-making [3]. Accurate forecasting\nof climatic variables such as temperature, precipitation, and\npollutant concentrations enables proactive measures to mit-\nigate adverse effects associated with climate variability and\nchange. Time series forecasting, a fundamental aspect of\nsequence modeling tasks, is crucial for capturing the temporal\ndynamics inherent in climate data. Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) [4] and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks\n[5] have been instrumental in addressing these tasks due to\ntheir ability to model temporal dependencies within sequen-\ntial data. However, as the complexity and dimensionality of\nclimate datasets increase-owing to factors such as diverse\nenvironmental variables, varying meteorological conditions,\nand spatial heterogeneity-classical RNNs and LSTMs often\nrequire substantial computational resources and extensive pa-\nrameterization to effectively model intricate patterns and long-\nrange dependencies [6].\nQuantum computing has emerged as a promising paradigm\nthat leverages quantum mechanical principles such as su-\nperposition and entanglement to enhance machine learning\nmodels, offering significant computational advantages over tra-\nditional methods [7]. Specifically, quantum machine learning\n(QML) aims to exploit the computational strengths of quantum\nsystems to process information in high-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces more efficiently than classical counterparts [8]\u2013[11].\nThis capability positions quantum computing favorably for\nlarge-scale and high-dimensional applications, including en-\nvironmental monitoring, climate modeling, and other climate-\nrelated time-series forecasting tasks [12], [13].\nIn the context of time series prediction, prior efforts to\nintegrate quantum computing into sequence modeling have led\nto the development of Quantum-Enhanced Long Short-Term\nMemory (QLSTM) [14] and Quantum-Trained LSTM [15]\narchitectures based on Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs)\n[16]. While VQC-based QLSTMs incorporate quantum cir-\ncuits into neural network structures, they often entail complex\ncircuit designs and necessitate significant quantum resources.\nThis complexity presents substantial challenges for implemen-\ntation on current quantum hardware, which is constrained by\nlimitations in qubit coherence times and gate fidelities [17].\nQuantum kernel methods offer an alternative approach by\nembedding classical data into quantum feature spaces using\nquantum circuits [18], enabling efficient computation of inner\nproducts (kernels) in these high-dimensional spaces [19], [20].\nQuantum kernels can capture complex data structures with po-\ntentially fewer trainable parameters and reduced computational\noverhead compared to both classical models and VQC-based\nquantum models [21]. This approach leverages the efficiency\nof quantum systems in representing and manipulating high-\ndimensional data, providing a means to enhance model ex-\npressiveness without proportionally increasing computational\ndemands [22].\nThis paper introduces the Quantum Kernel Long Short-\nTerm Memory (QK-LSTM) network [23], which integrates"}, {"title": "II.

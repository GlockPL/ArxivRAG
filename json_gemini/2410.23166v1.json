This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP). Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas. To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access. Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background. 2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming. We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality. Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them. Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method\u00b9.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research, machine learning researchers face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas. Against this backdrop, generating new ideas and innovative concepts efficiently has become a pressing need. Recent advancements in large language models (e.g., GPT-4 (Ouyang et al., 2022), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024), GLM-4 (Zeng et al., 2024), and etc), have demonstrated immense potential in enhancing innovation generation. These models are not only capable of understanding and generating complex academic content but also excel in aligning multimodal information, constructing implicit chains of thought, and uncovering non-obvious connections. Leveraging LLMs to assist researchers in generating new ideas holds significant implications for improving research productivity and offers a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the design of future intelligent research assistants.\nLarge language model (LLM)-based idea proposers should have the ability to understand the user-provided research background, autonomously retrieve relevant literature, and generate novel and feasible ideas aimed at addressing problems within the given background. Some previous works have proposed their methods (Wang et al., 2024; Baek et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). However, existing LLM-based idea proposers still face two challenges: 1) Similar to human researchers, literature"}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORKS", "content": "Around 60 years ago, scientists began exploring scientific discoveries based on literature retrieval, known as Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) (Swanson, 1986). This approach concentrated on a specific, narrow type of hypothesis: the connections between pairs of concepts, often involving drugs and diseases. LBD introduced the \u201cABC\" model, positing that two concepts A and C are hypothesized to be linked if they appear in conjunction with an intermediate concept B in the literature.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, and one of the most intriguing applications is their ability to generate scientific hypotheses (Wang et al., 2024; Baek et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). LLMs, trained on extensive datasets encompassing a vast array of scientific literature, possess an impressive capacity to recognize patterns and synthesize information across disciplines. By leveraging their advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, these models can propose novel hypotheses that might not be immediately apparent to researchers. The process begins with the model receiving a prompt, typically related to a specific scientific domain, which guides it to generate hypotheses grounded in existing knowledge while also incorporating innovative perspectives. For example, SCIMON (Wang et al., 2024) uses retrieval of \"inspirations\" from past scientific papers to generate ideas. It explicitly optimizes for novelty by iteratively comparing generated ideas with prior papers and updating them until sufficient novelty is achieved. In contrast, Research Agent (Baek et al., 2024) starts with a core paper as the primary focus and expands its knowledge by connecting information over an academic graph and retrieving entities from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts. It also leverages mul-tiple Reviewing Agents to provide iterative reviews and feedback for refining the generated ideas. AI Scientist leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate research ideas, im-plement and execute experiments, search for related works, and produce comprehensive research"}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "We propose a Scientific Paper Idea Proposer (SciPIP) that takes the user-provided background of a specific research field as input, retrieves relevant literature from the database, and generates novel and feasible ideas. To achieve this, we will first construct a literature database in Section 3.1 for literature retrieval during the idea proposal process. Then, in Section 3.2, we detail how to retrieve literature related to the user-provided background. Finally, in Section 3.3, we outline the process of idea proposal."}, {"title": "3.1 LITERATURE DATABASE CONSTRUCTION", "content": "Just like human researchers, reading other literature and drawing inspirations from them is an im-portant process for LLMs to generate valuable ideas. However, online literature reading is a very time-consuming process, so we collect a literature database in advance for the following literature retrieval and idea proposal process.\nTo be specific, we collect papers published in ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in past ten years, yielding a database with 48,895 papers. For each paper, we parse the PDF file and extract its title, abstract, introduction, method, and references sections. Then, as shown in Figure 1 , given an LLM $f$, we prompt it to read and summarize the paper as:\n$\\begin{equation}\nE(p) = f(T_1,T^{(P)}),\n\\end{equation}\n$\\begin{equation}\n(T^{(P)}_b, T^{(P)}_s, T^{(P)}_m) = f(T_2,T^{(P)}_a, T^{(P)}_i, T^{(P)}_m),\n\\end{equation}\n$\\begin{equation}\nT^{(P)}_{cr} = f(T_3,T^{(P)}_i, T^{(P)}_m),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $T^{(P)}_t, T^{(P)}_a, T^{(P)}_i, T^{(P)}_m$ are the paper $p$'s title, abstract, introduction, and method sections. $E(P), T^{(P)}_b, T^{(P)}_s, T^{(P)}_m, T^{(P)}_{di}, T^{(P)}_{cr}$ are extracted entities, background, summary, main ideas, detailed ideas, and core references, as shwon in Figure 1. $T_i, i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ represent our designed prompt templates, and specific prompts are shown in the Appendix A.1. In practice, we use GLM-42 (Zeng et al., 2024) as $f$. Besides, \u201cCore References\" in Figure 1 means extracting papers referenced in introduction and method sections, because we believe these references have the greatest impact on paper $p$ among all references."}, {"title": "3.2 LITERATURE RETRIEVAL AND FILTERING", "content": "Literature retrieval is an essential process for idea proposal. It should follow the rule of comprehen-siveness and low-redundancy. On the one hand, a comprehensive retrieval can provide researchers with instructive inspirations and avoid repetitive idea proposal. On the other hand, more retrieved papers are not necessarily better because redundant papers may also introduce noise and disperse a researcher's attention. To this end, we first propose a SEC-based (Semantics, Entities, and Citation co-occurrence) literature retrieval. Then, we propose a clustering-based literature filtering to pick out the most helpful papers. The process is shown in Figure 2."}, {"title": "3.2.1 SEC-BASED LITERATURE RETRIEVAL", "content": "Semantics-based retrieval. As shown in Figure 2, given a user-provided background $T^{(u)}$, we encode it as an embedding with Sentence-BERT (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019), marked as $e^{(u)}_b$. Then, $e^{(u)}_b$ is used to search in the literature database $D$ for its semantic neighbors. Specifically, $e^{(u)}_b$ is compared with $e_s$ of all papers' backgrounds in the literature database to identify a subset of papers with the maximum cosine similarity as the semantic-based retrieval results. Assume the retrieved papers as $N_1$,\n$\\begin{equation}\nN_1 = \\{p | e^{(p)}_b \\in \\text{TopK}(\\text{cosine}(e^{(u)}_b, e^{(i)}_b)) \\text{ for } i \\in D\\},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p$ or $i$ represents a paper in the literature database. In practice, we take $K = 55$ for the TopK operation.\nEntity-based retrieval. As we can see in Figure 2, after semantic literature retrieval, we take the user-provided background $T^{(u)}$ as input and prompt GLM-4 to extract all entities in the background. Then, the abstract section of semantics-based retrieved papers (i.e., $p \\in N_1$) are also given to the GLM-4 to extract their entities. The exact prompt we use is provided in the Appendix A.1. After entity extraction, we also expand the entity set by giving these entities back to GLM-4 and let it generate some synonyms. The motivation behind entity expansion is that the same concept may express in different ways, and entity expansion can help us retrieve papers that use synonyms in the following process. We notate the entity set after synonym expansion as $E_1$.\nAdditionally, we further expand the entity set through an entity-neighborhood-based approach. In simple terms, for an entity $T_e$ in the current entity set $E_1$, any paper $p$ that includes entity $T_e$ should"}, {"title": "3.2.2 LITERATURE CLUSTERING", "content": "After SEC-based literature retrieval, we may get over 500 papers, so further filtering is essential to pick out the most significant ones. Since we have observed that the retrieved papers often present similar ideas, we hope to retain only one paper among those with similar content during the gen-eration of new ideas. To achieve this, we propose clustering the papers based on cosine similarity measures. Specifically, we first define the embedding of a retrieved paper as:\n$\\begin{equation}\ne^{(p)} = w_se^{(p)}_s + w_ie^{(p)}_{di},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $e^{(p)}_s$ and $e^{(p)}_{di}$ are embeddings for summary and main ideas of an idea, as illustrated in Figure 1. We choose $w_s = w_i = 0.5$ in practice. Then, we apply clustering to group papers according to their cosine similarity. In practice, since the semantic embeddings of all papers are pre-recorded in a database, we only need to perform the similarity comparison and clustering processes. Finally, we select one paper from each cluster, respectively, and make up the retrieved papers."}, {"title": "3.3 IDEA PROPOSAL", "content": "Upon completion of the literature retrieval, we propose three approaches for generating research paper ideas. In essence, the idea generation process can leverage two types of information: the first is derived from the content of the retrieved papers, which inspires the LLM to generate ideas; the second involves the LLM freely brainstorming to produce new ideas. Based on this principle, we delineate three methods of idea generation that vary in their application of brainstorming.\nAs illustrated in Figure 3(a), the direct proposal method (SciPIP-A), does not use brainstorm. While the first dual-path proposal method (SciPIP-B), as Figure 3(b) shows, utilizes the user-provided background into two branches. The first branch employs this background for literature retrieval, problem summarization, and idea generation based on the retrieved literature, while the second branch engages in brainstorming solutions directly from the user-provided background. Following the independent generation of ideas in both branches, the outputs are merged and subsequently fil-tered and refined to yield the final ideas. Similarly, as shown in Figure 3(c), the second dual-path proposal method (SciPIP-C) follows a process analogous to SciPIP-B, with the key distinction being that the content generated through the LLM's brainstorming is utilized not only for idea generation but also integrated with the user-provided background for entity extraction and other literature re-trieval processes. We will provide a detailed exposition of these three methods of idea proposal in the following sections. We use GPT-403 by default in this section."}, {"title": "3.3.1 DIRECT IDEA PROPOSAL METHOD", "content": "As depicted in Figure 3(a), in the direct proposal method, we first retrieve papers following the pipeline described in Section 3.2. Then, the user-provided background along with the retrieved papers are utilized to prompt the LLM to summarize the core problem we aim to address and provide justifications. The specific prompts can be found in the Appendix A.1.\nWith the summarized problem and justifications, the LLM is prompted to generate around 10 initial ideas. In the prompt, both the problem, the justification and the retrieved papers are provided. The LLM is encouraged to generate clear, innovative, valid, and comprehensive ideas. The specific prompts for this step can be also found in the Appendix A.1.\nThough the prompt has declared, the initially generated ideas may still have shortcomings in terms of novelty or relevance to the problem. To address this, we filter the initial ideas using prompt engi-neering (prompts are illustrated in the Appendix A.1), with the primary criterion being that the ideas are generated in response to the given problem. Additionally, the ideas must exhibit a high degree of novelty and feasibility. During this process, each generated idea is evaluated independently, and about half of them will be filtered.\nThen, the LLM is encouraged to further improve the filtered ideas by considering their inter-relationships. That is, the LLM is tasked with considering the compatibility of the ideas, ensuring that it does not generate conflicting or repetitive ideas. Moreover, the LLM is required to gen-"}, {"title": "3.3.2 DUAL-PATH IDEA PROPOSAL METHODS", "content": "We find that the directly generated ideas often rely heavily on the retrieved literature, sometimes closely resembling the methods presented in those papers. They frequently involve transferring approaches from other fields or making minor improvements to existing methods within the same field, resulting in relatively ordinary novelty and rarely yielding breakthrough thinking.\nTherefore, we further propose idea proposers that incorporates brainstorming, encouraging the LLM to produce more novel thoughts. Specifically, brainstorming can play a role in both processes of idea generation. As shown in Figure 3(b), the SciPIP-B has two paths, where one path follows the direct proposal approach, while the other path uses the LLM to brainstorm possible solutions based on the user-input background, outputting these as ideas. Ultimately, these ideas will be merged with those generated based on the retrieved papers, filtered and refined to produce the final ideas. In this model, the results of brainstorming are independent of the generation based on retrieved papers.\nIn another approach, as shown in Figure 3(c), brainstorming generates ideas independently while also being utilized in literature retrieval. Specifically, we extract entities from the brainstorming results and incorporate them as part of the entity set in the literature retrieval process. With this method, some keywords arising from the brainstorming will also help enhance the effectiveness of literature retrieval. The ideas generated through brainstorming will also be merged with those produced after literature retrieval."}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENTS", "content": "The experiments in this study are divided into two parts: retrospective experiments and innovation experiments. Retrospective experiments refer to testing whether different algorithms can generate the same ideas and literature retrieval results as the original papers on the evaluation dataset (i.e., ACL 2024 papers) with providing the background of the papers as input. In contrast, innovation experiments allow the models to freely propose new ideas, which are then evaluated from multiple perspectives, including novelty and feasibility."}, {"title": "4.2 RETROSPECTIVE EXPERIMENTS FOR IDEA PROPOSAL.", "content": "Compared algorithms.

Since AI Scientist does not perform a literature retrieval when generat-ing ideas, the results primarily on SCIMON (Wang et al., 2024) and ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2024). However, the experimental setups and literature database of SCIMON and ResearchAgent for generating scientific paper ideas differ from those in this study. Additionally, ResearchAgent is not open source, making it challenging to fully replicate the exact algorithm. Therefore, based on the descriptions in the original papers, we implement similar literature search algorithms, namely SCIMON-like and ResearchAgent-like in Table 4.\nEvaluation protocol. Only a few reference papers are crucial for generating a paper's idea; using all citations as ground truth may introduce significant noise. Among contemporaneous papers, there may be similar ideas, and researchers might only cite one of them. To address this, we propose two strategies: We believe that the most important citations for a paper typically appear in the introduction and method sections; thus, we extract only these sections' citations as ground truth during PDF parsing. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, our method clusters the retrieved literature after searching, treating all papers in the same cluster as similar. In the retrospective experiment, we evaluate the distance between ground truth citations and cluster centers. If a ground truth citation falls within a cluster retrieved by SciPIP, we consider the retrieval result correct.\nResults and analyses. The results are shown in Table 4, where Recall10 represents the propor-tion of correctly retrieved papers when the algorithm is restricted to returning only 10 papers. For example, if the ground truth for a paper's literature search includes 20 references, a recall rate of 0.684 indicates that approximately 13 relevant papers were correctly retrieved. From the data in the table, it can be observed that our algorithm successfully retrieves more relevant papers compared to SCIMON and ResearchAgent. We also provide some ablation studies about literature retrieval in Table 5. As we can see, SE performs better than using only semantics or entities for retrieval. Moreover, citation co-occurrence and clustering also help improve the retrieval results."}, {"title": "5 CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS", "content": "In this paper, we propose a method for generating scientific paper ideas and demonstrate its ef-fectiveness on natural language processing datasets.

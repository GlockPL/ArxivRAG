Due to the absence of labeled data in the target domain,\nrecent studies tend to rely on pre-trained language models to gener-\nate large amounts of synthetic data for training purposes. However,\nthese approaches entail additional computational costs associated\nwith the generation process. Different from them, we discover a\nstriking resemblance between table-filling methods in ASTE and\ntwo-stage Object Detection (OD) in computer vision, which inspires\nus to revisit the cross-domain ASTE task and approach it from an\nOD standpoint. This allows the model to benefit from the OD ex-\ntraction paradigm and region-level alignment. Building upon this\npremise, we propose a novel method named Table-Filling via Mean\nTeacher (TFMT). Specifically, the table-filling methods encode the\nsentence into a 2D table to detect word relations, while TFMT\ntreats the table as a feature map and utilizes a region consistency\nto enhance the quality of those generated pseudo labels. Addition-\nally, considering the existence of the domain gap, a cross-domain\nconsistency based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is designed to\nalleviate domain shift problems. Our method achieves state-of-the-\nart performance with minimal parameters and computational costs,\nmaking it a strong baseline for cross-domain ASTE.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Fine-grained sentiment analysis is an important research direction\nin Natural Language Processing (NLP).

INTRODUCTION", "content": "User interfaces have significantly evolved over the last few decades. From early text-based systems to modern graphical and multimodal interfaces, the developments in human-computer-driven interactions were strongly driven by advancements in software and hardware. This review examines how Generative AI, particularly multimodal large language models (LLMs) [1], is poised to further transform UI design by enabling dynamic personalization, context retention, and efficient scalability. It seems inevitable that with the advent of highly capable LLMs being accessible on every device, the way people interact with technology is going to adapt. This raises a few critical questions: What is the ideal interface for users to interact with AI-powered systems? Is there going to be a single trend or will interfaces adapt to each type of application specifically? How will the availability of immersive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) glasses influence this? How long can it take people to adapt to a completely new interface experience? Some of the biggest technology companies have been experiencing with introducing new ways to interact with technology, but in the end, they converge to very similar styles and ideas.\nWe will also address the limitations of current frameworks and the challenges of implementing AI in this domain, particularly when constrained by hardware like mobile phones."}, {"title": "A. Problem Statement: The Interface Dilemma", "content": "Since the release of Chat GPT by Open AI, there has been a massive spike in interest in AI-driven applications. The chatbot-like interface, which was popularized by Chat GPT has quickly become the standard for human-AI interactions. Despite recent developments of multimodal LLMs, chat-based interactions are still the most popular ones, despite their limitations. As a result, most applications are limited to a very similar user interface and require high-quality user input to help the LLM understand the context or mood. One example of such applications can be voice assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri. Apple first integrated Siri into its ecosystem with the iPhone 4S in 2011. Since then, both the hardware and software it runs, as well as its capabilities, have improved massively. However, the way users interact with Siri has stayed exactly the same. Similarly, Google Assistant and Alexa, despite being competing products, offer exactly almost identical experiences when it comes to interacting with their device.\nWe already possess powerful multimodal LLMs capable of processing text, images, and voice. However, the challenge lies in determining the best interface for human-computer interaction. Should it be console-based, GUI-driven, or even integrated into VR glasses?

However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations when applied to more sophisticated multimodal LLMs, which are designed to process not only text but also images, video, and audio. The chatbot model is inherently linear, lacking the flexibility to seamlessly integrate multiple input types. As a result, users must manually structure their inputs to ensure the LLM can interpret and generate relevant outputs across modalities [12]. Furthermore, the dependency on text-based input places a burden on users to provide detailed, well-structured prompts, reducing accessibility for individuals less familiar with technical language or who prefer more dynamic interaction modes."}, {"title": "B. Emergence of Voice-Based Interaction", "content": "Alongside chat-based interfaces, voice-driven systems have become increasingly popular, driven by voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. These systems allow users to interact with AI using natural speech, making them more accessible and user-friendly for a wider audience. The introduction of live conversations with LLMs expands this functionality further, allowing for real-time, multimodal interaction where voice inputs are integrated into the processing pipeline of advanced AI models [13]. However, despite the growing prominence of voice-based interfaces, they face challenges in understanding context, mood, and complex queries, particularly when compared to human interactions [2]. For example, while voice assistants can handle basic commands, they often struggle with maintaining long-term context or interpreting nuanced user inputs in real-time [14].\nRecent efforts to enhance live conversations with LLMs involve incorporating context retention mechanisms and emotion detection algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses. This is particularly evident in the development of systems that combine voice, text, and visual inputs, allowing the AI to dynamically adjust to the user's changing needs. However, achieving fluidity in these interactions remains a challenge, as systems must balance the cognitive load on users with the AI's capacity to process and respond to multimodal inputs in real time [15]."}, {"title": "C.

Designing Intuitive Multimodal Interfaces", "content": "The core of the interface dilemma lies in designing an intuitive, user-friendly interface that can fully leverage the multimodal capabilities of LLMs. This involves determining not only the optimal interaction modality (text, voice, video) but also how to seamlessly integrate these modalities into a single, coherent user experience [21]. Current research suggests that a hybrid approach-combining the simplicity of GUIs with the versatility of multimodal inputs may provide the most practical solution [19]. In such systems, users could begin an interaction with a text prompt, seamlessly transition to voice or video input, and receive contextually relevant responses from the LLM without requiring separate interfaces for each modality.\nMoreover, advances in context retention algorithms are making it possible for multimodal LLMs to remember past interactions and adjust their responses based on the user's behavior over time [22]. These advancements are crucial for improving personalization, enhancing user satisfaction, and reducing the cognitive load associated with multimodal interactions.\nOverall, the interface dilemma is a multifaceted problem that highlights the growing gap between the capabilities of multimodal LLMs and the limitations of current UIs. While chat-based and voice-driven interfaces dominate the landscape, they are ill-suited to fully harness the potential of multimodal systems. The challenge moving forward lies in designing versatile, intuitive interfaces that can dynamically handle text, voice, and visual inputs, while maintaining context and providing a personalized user experience.

Early Interfaces", "content": "In the earliest stages of human-computer interaction, UIs were primarily text-based and relied on manual command-line input. Users had to type specific commands to interact with computers, making the learning curve steep and restricting accessibility to a technically adept audience. Examples include the Command-Line Interface (CLI), where users had direct but complex control over the system's functions through text commands. Notable systems such as UNIX and MS-DOS embodied this interface model [23].\nThe development of GUIs in the 1970s and 1980s marked a revolutionary step in UI design. GUIs offered a more intuitive approach, replacing text commands with visual representations, such as icons, windows, and menus. Xerox PARC is often credited with pioneering the first GUI, which later influenced the design of both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems [24]. GUIs democratized computing, making it accessible to a broader audience."}, {"title": "B. Modern Interfaces", "content": "The evolution of UIs continued with the rise of modern interfaces, which now support a range of input methods beyond text and graphical elements. Today's UIs incorporate touch-screens, voice recognition, and gesture-based inputs, reflecting the ongoing shift toward more natural and seamless forms of interaction [14], [17]. These advancements are exemplified by smartphones and devices like Amazon's Alexa, which allow users to interact via voice commands, and tablets and smartphones, which rely on touch-based interactions.\nWith the advent of multimodal LLMs, current interfaces must handle inputs from multiple modalities, such as text, voice, and images, while dynamically adapting to user needs. This has brought about significant challenges, particularly in determining the most suitable interface for these AI-driven systems. For example, should users interact with LLMs through a console-based interface, a traditional GUI, or an immersive technology like VR or AR? Each modality offers unique benefits and limitations [15], [16]."}, {"title": "C. Interface Limitations", "content": "Despite the progress in UI design, several limitations persist. One major drawback of many modern interfaces is their inability to retain user context across sessions. For instance, most current UIs are session-based, meaning they do not remember user preferences or interaction history, which limits their ability to offer personalized experiences [12]. This is particularly challenging in the context of AI-driven systems, where personalization is key to enhancing user satisfaction and system efficiency.\nAdditionally, the emergence of multimodal LLMs raises critical questions about the future of interface design. The decision on whether to prioritize console-based, GUI-driven, or immersive technologies remains unresolved. Each modality presents trade-offs in terms of usability, accessibility, and processing requirements. For example, console-based interfaces may offer flexibility for developers but are less accessible to non-technical users, while GUIs provide visual simplicity but may struggle to handle complex multimodal inputs efficiently [11].\nMoreover, immersive technologies like VR and AR have the potential to offer richer, more interactive experiences, but they come with hardware and usability challenges that make them impractical for widespread use in everyday applications, especially those deployed on mobile devices [20]."}, {"title": "D.

Tech Stack Overview", "content": "The current technology stack for UIs integrates server-client communication models with cross-platform frameworks, enabling applications to function seamlessly across devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers [23]. Cross-platform development frameworks, such as React Native and Flutter, offer consistent interfaces and enhanced scalability by reducing development effort across various operating systems. Generative AI introduces new dynamics to these stacks by incorporating modalities like voice, text, and image, which must be synchronized into a cohesive interface. Integrating Generative AI with these UIs can enable real-time adaptation, transforming user interactions by adding layers of personalization, engagement, and responsiveness [25]. This setup, however, requires careful consideration of server load balancing, device compatibility, and efficient data processing to maintain a seamless user experience, especially on resource-limited mobile devices [26].\nIntegrating Generative AI into the existing UI tech stack further demands a robust backend infrastructure to support AI model inference and processing capabilities, especially for real-time interactions. Typically, these integrations rely on cloud-based AI services, such as AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, or Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, which offer scalable solutions to host and manage complex AI models [20]. However, balancing between on-device and cloud processing is crucial to ensure optimal performance, particularly for latency-sensitive applications. Mobile and IoT devices benefit from edge computing solutions that enable localized, efficient data handling to reduce dependency on remote servers, minimizing delay in data processing and enhancing privacy through localized data storage [19]. This hybrid model of cloud-edge collaboration not only optimizes the tech stack for multimodal AI processing but also extends device capabilities, providing users with real-time, personalized experiences without compromising on speed or responsiveness."}, {"title": "B. Generative AI for Personalization", "content": "Generative AI models, like LLMs, enable real-time adaptation by generating content tailored to user behaviors and preferences. Through analysis of user inputs\u2014whether in text, voice, or image format\u2014these models can dynamically adjust the interface or content, offering users a personalized experience that evolves based on their actions [5]. Mobile devices, given their ubiquitous presence and support for multimodal capabilities, serve as an ideal platform to test lightweight AI-driven interfaces. These devices can utilize AI models to recognize voice commands, analyze visual inputs, and respond in natural language, all within a compact form factor. The adaptability of Generative AI on mobile platforms has shown potential in applications ranging from personalized recommendations in media to adaptive learning in educational apps, allowing for scalable AI deployment on devices with limited processing power [4].\nThe effectiveness of Generative AI for personalization relies heavily on its capacity to retain contextual information across interactions, which enables a deeper level of user-specific customization. Huang [27] contributes to this personalization by demonstrating how AI assistants can generate user experiences tailored to diverse personas, allowing designers to address varied user needs and behaviors more effectively. This persona-based approach to AI-driven interaction highlights the importance of customized personas in creating engaging and relevant user experiences. Building on the ability of AI to create persona-based interactions, advanced Generative AI models further expand personalization by remembering user preferences, interaction history, and adapting to nuanced behavioral patterns over time.\nFor instance, in e-commerce applications, Generative AI can provide tailored product suggestions based on previous purchases, browsing habits, and current trends [28]. Furthermore, as user behavior evolves, these models are capable of dynamically updating their recommendations or adjusting the user interface to better suit changing preferences, all while operating within the constraints of mobile processing power [9]. By utilizing edge computing and federated learning approaches, these systems can execute personalization tasks directly on the device, thus optimizing response times and ensuring privacy by keeping user data local [29]. This approach not only improves the efficiency and responsiveness of personalized AI interactions but also aligns with increasing demands for data security and privacy in user-centered applications."}, {"title": "C. The Function Matching Problem", "content": "A significant challenge in AI-driven UIs lies in matching generated content with appropriate application services, a problem exacerbated in multimodal systems where alignment between inputs (e.g., text, voice, and video) and functional outputs is essential. This function matching problem is particularly pronounced in multimodal interfaces, where each input type (e.g., voice command or video analysis) must accurately align with its corresponding output function within the system [9]. Ensuring the generated content or commands map effectively to the application's services requires robust context management, real-time adaptability, and accurate interpretation of each modality [29]. For example, a user's spoken command might need to trigger specific visual responses or textual feedback, depending on the interaction history and current context. This issue presents a substantial hurdle in designing cohesive multimodal UIs, where efficient synchronization across modalities remains crucial to provide a seamless, intuitive user experience [12].\nThe function matching problem also involves addressing inconsistencies in AI-generated outputs, which may arise due to variations in user intent, language ambiguities, or differences in input modalities. For instance, when a user's voice command ambiguously references an action that could apply to multiple functionalities (e.g., \"open\" for both files and applications), the system must employ advanced disambiguation techniques, such as context-aware NLP and probabilistic reasoning, to interpret the correct function [19]. Additionally, for applications requiring real-time multimodal coordination-such as those in AR and VR environments-the challenge of function matching intensifies as the system must process diverse, simultaneous inputs while ensuring synchronous outputs [25]. Leveraging reinforcement learning and adaptive feedback loops, systems can refine their accuracy over time, gradually improving the alignment between multimodal inputs and the associated functional responses, thereby enhancing overall user satisfaction and reducing the cognitive load on users [20]. By integrating these advanced matching techniques, designers can create more fluid and adaptive AI-driven UIs that anticipate and react to user needs more effectively."}, {"title": "V.

However, they are less accessible to general users, require more knowledge to use them, and do not take advantage of AI capabilities.\n\u2022 GUIs provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, especially for diverse user bases. However, they may be limited in multimodal settings requiring fluid processing of various input types. Songqin et al. propose a large multimodal model for mobile GUIs that emphasizes privacy-preserving data handling and the use of hybrid visual encoders, which adapt to different resolutions and layouts. This approach allows for nuanced interactions across diverse GUIs without sacrificing privacy or accuracy in handling multilingual content [30].\n\u2022 Voice-based interfaces offer significant flexibility and can enhance user experience through natural, conversational exchanges.

This approach aligns with multimodal interaction goals by enabling hands-free control, especially beneficial in contexts where direct device handling may be challenging or unnecessary.\n\u2022 Gesture-based interaction: Beyond fully equipped smart spaces, gesture-based interactions in conventional environments (e.g., smart check-out systems) utilize camera-based systems to interpret gestures, allowing users to interact with digital interfaces naturally. Such setups enable touch-free control without relying on substantial physical infrastructure [35], presenting an accessible, cost-effective option for gesture-based interaction."}, {"title": "B. Hardware Considerations: Mobile Phones", "content": "The deployment of LLMs on mobile devices brings unique hardware challenges due to limitations in processing power, memory, and energy efficiency. Maintaining state-of-the-art functionality without compromising performance is crucial, as mobile phones are the primary devices for human-AI interaction. A key solution is the integration of efficient memory management techniques, like KV cache compression and chunk-level memory optimization, which can significantly reduce latency in LLM processing by managing memory at a granular level. Such innovations enable smoother, stateful LLM services on mobile devices, minimizing switching delays and enhancing user experience without exhausting memory resources [36].\nOne of the primary constraints in mobile LLM implementation is the device's limited energy and processing capacity, which necessitates lightweight model architectures and the use of accelerators like Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs have been instrumental, achieving up to a 22x speedup over CPUs, thus facilitating real-time AI functionalities even on constrained devices [37]. Advances in model quantization, mainly down to 8- or even 4-bit precision, are further optimizing these models, allowing robust LLMs to operate with minimal memory and processing demands. For instance, a 3-billion-parameter GPT model has demonstrated efficient performance on devices with just 4GB of RAM, exemplifying how quantization can enable powerful on-device AI within tight resource limits [38].\nTo help examine the performance of different LLM-based mobile agents, Deng et al. [39] propose a benchmarking framework that provides realistic test scenarios by integrating both UI operations and API calls, ensuring comprehensive evaluation of these models in practical, user-centered tasks. Such benchmarks highlight the importance of balancing computational efficiency with user demands and allow for finding areas that require further optimization. Further, the proposed approach of treating mobile LLMs as OS-level services further centralizes AI functionalities, promoting better resource sharing and reducing redundancy, as multiple applications can access a single LLM instance rather than each maintaining separate models [40].\nLastly, smart spaces provide a distinct advantage in multimodal interaction contexts by leveraging distributed sensor infrastructure to reduce processing demands on mobile devices [41]. Through ambient sensing, these environments capture user input, interpret gestures, and offer responsive interactions with minimal reliance on local device resources [34]. Gesture-based systems, like intelligent self-checkout setups, similarly reduce hardware constraints by centralizing processing in external infrastructure [35].

Current Limitations and Challenges", "content": "1) Technical constraints: Implementing AI-driven UIs faces significant technical challenges, especially regarding real-time performance and memory retention. One primary limitation is achieving low-latency responses while handling multiple, concurrent input types, such as text, voice, and video, seamlessly within multimodal interfaces. Real-time performance is critical to maintaining user engagement and satisfaction, yet processing multimodal inputs at such speeds often requires substantial computational resources, typically available only on high-end hardware.\nA further challenge is designing lightweight frameworks that can operate effectively on mobile devices, which are typically constrained by limited processing power, memory, and battery life. Although cloud-based processing can alleviate some of these demands, it introduces latency and potential privacy concerns. Thus, developing on-device AI capabilities that retain multimodal LLMs functionality without sacrificing performance remains an area for ongoing research. Lightweight frameworks optimized for mobile devices must balance computational efficiency with the robust features necessary to process diverse input types in real-time. Techniques such as model quantization, memory optimization, and parameter-efficient tuning are essential to supporting the full capabilities of multimodal LLMs on mobile platforms.\n2) Ethical considerations: AI-driven interfaces also present ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, transparency, and user trust. As Al systems collect and process vast amounts of personal data to adaptively enhance user experiences, they risk compromising user privacy. This challenge is compounded in multimodal interfaces, where various data types such as voice, text, and video are processed simultaneously, increasing the volume and sensitivity of collected information.\nOne major ethical concern is the \"black-box\" nature of many AI models, which often operate without clear insight into how they reach certain decisions. This lack of transparency can reduce user trust and create barriers to adoption, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare or finance. To address this, explainable AI (XAI) techniques are essential, providing users with understandable insights into AI decision-making processes. Additionally, the risk of bias in Al responses is another ethical issue. Without careful design and training on diverse datasets, AI-driven interfaces may exhibit biased behavior, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes. Incorporating fairness algorithms and extensive dataset diversity during training can mitigate these biases.\nFor mobile deployments, resource limitations complicate these ethical considerations further. Processing sensitive data on mobile devices, for instance, requires privacy-preserving methods, such as data anonymization and secure storage."}, {"title": "B.

Detailed discussion on these future directions are provided next.\n1) Al-automated interfaces and dynamic contextual UIs: The future of UIs is moving towards full automation, where UIs can dynamically adapt to user behavior and environmental context without requiring manual customization. AI-automated interfaces leverage real-time data on user preferences, actions, and situational factors such as location, activity, or emotional state-to adjust elements like layout, functionality, and interaction methods accordingly. By continuously learning from user interactions, these UIs can provide seamless and anticipatory responses, enhancing accessibility and usability while minimizing cognitive load.\nDynamic, context-aware UIs represent a significant step forward in creating personalized and responsive interfaces. These systems can modify interface elements based on live feedback, adjusting to changes in lighting, movement, or even user mental states. Lightweight frameworks and advancements in edge computing and federated learning play a crucial role in enabling these adaptive interfaces to function efficiently on mobile devices, which are often constrained by limited processing capabilities. By processing sensitive data locally on the device, these frameworks preserve user privacy, ensuring that dynamic, contextually adaptive UIs can provide real-time personalization without compromising security or performance.\n2) New modalities and hybrid approaches: Emerging interaction modalities are paving the way for innovative and immersive experiences, with technologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), gesture recognition, and haptic feedback leading the charge. BCIs offer a groundbreaking approach to interaction by potentially enabling users to control digital systems through neural input, facilitating hands-free and thought-based control. While still in developmental stages, BCIs have promising applications in accessibility tools for users with mobility impairments, as well as in immersive environments like gaming and virtual reality.\nGesture recognition and haptic feedback are also gaining traction, particularly in AR and VR applications. Gesture recognition allows for intuitive, hands-free interaction by interpreting physical movements, while haptic feedback adds a tactile dimension, enhancing the immersive quality of user experiences. Together, these modalities create a more engaging and accessible interface, catering to a wide range of user preferences and needs.\nHybrid interfaces that combine traditional GUIs with multimodal inputs offer a versatile solution to the challenge of context retention and seamless transitions across input types. These hybrid UIs allow users to switch between text, voice, and visual interactions, creating a flexible and fluid interaction environment, especially on mobile devices where screen space is limited. Leveraging multimodal fusion techniques, these interfaces can integrate and align diverse input types-text, voice, images-in a cohesive manner.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "In modern manufacturing, the seamless integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is foundational. CAD facilitates the creation of detailed digital designs, marking the essential first steps in the manufacturing process [1]. Following this, CAPP plays a pivotal role by serving as the link between CAD and CAM that analyzes the necessary manufacturing processes and conditions [2]. Finally, CAM utilizes the insights provided by CAPP to control and automate the manufacturing equipment to transform a CAD design into a physical product [3]. This integrated approach ensures a smooth transition from digital blueprints to real-world products. Furthermore, this integrated method has significantly improved the efficiency of the manufacturing process. For example, Basinger et al. [2] showcased this advancement by introducing a hybrid manufacturing process planning system that automates process plans, achieving a substantial 35% reduction in machining time for a custom patient-specific bone plate.\nWithin the context of CAD, CAPP, and CAM's integrated workflow, one of the primary challenges faced by CAPP is automatic feature recognition (AFR). AFR is a key step in CAPP, involving the interpretation of CAD models and their translation into recognizable manufacturing features that CAM systems can use [3]. The accurate recognition of these features is crucial for generating effective manufacturing plans and optimizing the process parameters, making AFR a significant area of research in manufacturing automation.\nFor over four decades, researchers have been studying AFR to find different ways to detect machining features in CAD models [4,5]. Presently, AFR methodologies are primarily divided into two categories: rule-based and learning-based approaches [4-8]. For rule-based approaches, researchers must deeply understand the structures of machining features to create effective rules [8]. These rules are designed to detect machining features by analyzing their geometric and topological characteristics. In contrast, learning-based approaches employ machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. These techniques identify the relationships between machining features and their fundamental representations through extensive training data, moving away from the conventional dependence on predefined rules [9]. This technique has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of identifying complex and diverse machining features. For example, Muraleedharan and Muthuganapathy [10] utilized a learning-based approach with discrete Gauss maps and Random Forest classifiers for 24 distinct machining feature recognition. They achieved a test accuracy of 97.90% for single feature recognition with a reduced run time off 3.19 seconds. Similarly, Colligan et al. [11,12] developed the Hierarchical CADNet model based on graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) to recognize complex machining features in CAD models. They achieved a test accuracy of 97.37%, demonstrating its exceptional ability to process complex datasets with multiple intersecting machining features.\nDespite remarkable advancements in learning-based AFR it still faces some challenges. For example, most existing learning-based AFR methods [4,7,9,11,13\u201316] predominantly focus on machining features and do not consider the vast possibilities of additive manufacturing features such as extrusions. This oversight is particularly significant in hybrid manufacturing, which integrate machining and additive manufacturing [17]. The development of an AFR architecture that comprehensively recognizes both subtractive and additive features is crucial for advancing hybrid manufacturing processes. While there are attempts to recognize both types of manufacturing features, these efforts are limited in the scope of the number of distinct features recognized. For example, Shi et al. [18] used a 2D CNN for the recognition of only 10 isolated manufacturing features, including five additive and five subtractive features.\nIn addition to the difficulty of recognizing a diverse range of manufacturing features, significant research gaps exist in AFR methods, particularly concerning key manufacturing process planning elements. These gaps include the need for automatic extraction of stock sizes, and geometric dimensions for each identified feature, along with their orientations. These dimensional attributes are essential for subsequent decision-making during manufacturing process planning.\nTo tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach to recognize hybrid additive-subtractive manufacturing features and simultaneously extract the geometrical attributes from CAD models. These attributes include feature dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes. They key novelty and contribution of the proposed method is creation of a synthetic CAD dataset that encompasses a wide range of subtractive and additive manufacturing features, which are used to train a Hierarchical GCNN model for hybrid feature recognition. After feature recognition, each identified features in the CAD models are analyzed to extract feature dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes, utilizing the Python Open Cascade (PyOCC) [19]. The trained Hierarchical GCNN model demonstrates remarkable feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97% and a dimension extraction accuracy of 100% for identified features. Therefore, the proposed methodology facilitates improved manufacturing process planning, by providing additional context for decision-making.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the framework and methodology. Section 3 focuses on the results and discussion. The paper concludes with final thoughts and directions for future research in Section 4."}, {"title": "2. METHODOLOGY", "content": "2.1 Overview\nThe proposed framework introduces a significant advancement in the CGNN model [11] by integrating new additive features, termed as extrusions. As depicted in Figure 1, the process is initiated with the addition of new additive features to the machining feature dataset, setting the foundation for a more comprehensive and versatile model. Following this step, the process starts with the generation of hybrid additive-subtractive CAD dataset. A synthetic labeled dataset of 150,000 STEP files, encompassing both additive and subtractive features, is generated using Python Open Cascade (PyOCC) [19], effectively addressing the previously identified gap. The transition from dataset enhancement to the application phase highlights the dataset's role in facilitating the novel methodologies developed in this research. This broader dataset enables the model, initially designed for machining features, to identify a more comprehensive set of hybrid features. After developing the dataset, the STEP files are converted into Boundary Representation (B-Rep) Hierarchical Graphs. These graphs are then organized into mini batches, aligning with the model's training process. Through hyperparameter optimization, the model is fine-tuned for precision in feature recognition.\nNext, the proposed methodology's validation through a user-provided STEP file leverages a novel approach for the precise quantification of geometric dimensions and orientations, distinguishing this work from conventional applications of existing models. Furthermore, the development of a unique method for calculating minimum and maximum stock sizes is introduced, representing a significant advancement in the field, and offering new tools for decision-making in hybrid manufacturing processes. These methodologies, distinct from the model's initial capabilities, underscore the novelty and significance of the contributions to the field. Details of each section are explained below."}, {"title": "2.2 Dataset Development", "content": "The method initiates by integrating additional additive features into the GCNN model. These features encompass a variety of additive features such as cylindrical, rectangular/square, triangular, hexagonal, and pentagonal extrusions. This development increases the model's versatility, facilitating the recognition of 29 distinct manufacturing features. Each feature is labeled from 0 to 28. For each extrusion feature, distinct classes are established, which define their geometric and directional characteristics. This process leverages the PyOCC library to simulate material addition accurately. Additive features are differentiated from subtractive ones using predefined geometric sketches and direction vectors, a crucial step that ensures a precise representation of additive manufacturing processes."}, {"title": "2.3 Geometrical Dimensions of Recognized Features", "content": "After successfully recognizing features using the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model, the next step involves determining their geometrical dimensions. This involves calculating three basic geometric dimensions:\n\u2022 Geometric size of a feature\n\u2022 Stock sizes (minimum and maximum)\n\u2022 Feature orientation\nGeometric dimensions specify the unique characteristics of each feature, such as radius, depth, length, width, vertices, angle, or center. The specific dimensions to be measured depend on the type of feature. For example, for a rectangular feature, the length, width, and depth would be measured, while for a cylindrical feature, the diameter and height would be measured. These measurements are crucial for tailoring the manufacturing process to enhance adaptability across various feature types. Stock sizes include both minimum/base and maximum stock size of"}, {"title": "2.3.1 Geometric Size Extraction of a Feature", "content": "For each recognized feature, a specialized, object-oriented PyOCC-based script is invoked. Each feature has its own script with a unique set of rules, and the appropriate script is called based on the recognized feature. These scripts interact directly with CAD models, employing PyOCC and additional computational libraries to extract the relevant feature geometrical dimensions.\nThe process starts with the topological and geometrical exploration of the CAD model's topological entities, such as edges, faces, and vertices, which define features. These entities are then transformed into analyzable geometric objects, which are suitable for dimension extraction analysis.\nThe next step involves the extraction of specific dimensions for each feature. This includes identifying boundaries for each feature and extracting linear and curvilinear dimensions depending on the type of each feature. Linear dimensions include lengths and distances, while curvilinear dimensions include radii, diameters, and arc lengths. Additionally, we determine the coordinates of the vertices by traversing the topology of features.\nThe determination of linear dimensions, such as the length (L) or distance (D), is mathematically represented as:\n$L, D = \\sqrt{(x_2\u2212x_1)\u00b2 + (y_2 \u2014 y_1)\u00b2 + (z_2 \u2014 z_1)\u00b2}$      (1)\nwhere $(x_1,y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2, z_2)$ are the coordinates of two distinct points on the feature's boundary.\nCurvilinear dimensions, such as the radius (R) of a circular feature, are derived from the parametric equation of a circle in a plane:\n$R = \\sqrt{(x-h)\u00b2 + (y - k)\u00b2}$                                                     (2)\nwhere $(h, k)$ are the coordinates of the circle's center, and $(x, y)$ represents any point on the circumference.\nFor certain features, such as chamfers, the angular dimensions also need to be calculated. This involves analyzing the geometric relationships between faces and edges, and calculating the angles at which faces intersect. The angle ($\\theta$) of a chamfer or any feature is calculated based on the dot product of two vectors A and B, which correspond to the intersecting edges:\n$\\cos \\theta = \\frac{A. B}{|A||B|}$                                                                              (3)\nTo elucidate this methodology, the example of a blind hole feature is presented. The script calculates the coordinates of the hole's top face center (C1) and the bottom face center (C2) and determines the radius (R). The depth (d) is calculated as the Euclidean distance between C1 and C2 along the hole's depth axis, represented by:\n$d = ||\\vec{C2}-\\vec{C1}||$                                                          (4)\nwhere $\\vec{C2}$ and $\\vec{C1}$ are the position vectors of the top and bottom face centers, respectively.\nTo further validate the proposed method, dimension extraction of a circular end pocket feature is demonstrated. The script identifies the circular edges of the pocket, from which it calculates the centers of the end circles. The diameter (D) of the pocket is calculated as twice the radius (R), providing a measure of the pocket's overall width:\n$D = 2R = \\sqrt{(x_1 \u2212 x_2)\u00b2 + (y_1 \u2014 y_2)\u00b2}$                                                      (5)\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of diametrically opposite points on the pocket edge. The depth (d) of the pocket is measured by calculating the maximum distance between the vertices on the pocket's boundary and the plane defined by the circular edge, along the normal vector (n) to this plane:\n$d = \\max (\\vec{n}. (\\vec{v} \u2013 C)|)$                                                        (6)\nwhere $\\vec{v}$ represents the coordinates of a vertex on the pocket's boundary. The slot length (L) of the pocket is the straight-line distance between the centers of the two circular ends of the pocket. It is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:\n$L = \\sqrt{(x_2 \u2212 x_1)\u00b2 + (y_2 - y_1)\u00b2 + (z_2 - z_1)\u00b2}$          (7)\nwhere $(x_1,y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2, z_2)$ are the coordinates of the centers of circular ends of the pocket."}, {"title": "2.3.2 Feature Orientation Extraction", "content": "After the extraction of geometrical dimensions, the orientation of recognized features within the CAD model is determined through geometrical analysis. Features are classified based on their orientation into two categories: upright and tilted. Upright features have normal vectors that align with the global Z-axis, indicating perpendicularity to the model's base plane. This alignment simplifies machining operations due to straightforward tool access and minimal angular adjustments. Conversely, tilted features have normal vectors aligned along the X or Y axis, showing a significant angular deviation from the Z- axis. Such features are not perpendicular to the base plane, requiring specialized machining strategies for their unique orientation. For instance, a cylindrical hole is considered upright if its depth axis (the direction along which the normal vector is calculated) aligns with the Z-axis, and tilted if it aligns more with the X or Y axes."}, {"title": "2.3.3 Stock Size Calculation", "content": "Building upon the extracted feature geometrical dimensions and orientation analysis, stock sizes are calculated for manufacturing process decision-making. The stock sizes are categorized into two types: minimum stock size and maximum stock size.\nThe calculation of the minimum stock size focuses on the essential volume needed for machining. Bounding box analysis is employed to identify the smallest enclosing box of all necessary machining features. This analysis excludes additive features, ensuring that the focus remains solely on the material required for machining. Spatial transformations are applied to dynamically adjust to the geometric specifications of each feature, accurately determining the minimum material volume required. Spatial transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling are applied to align and size the features accurately within the bounding box. These can be represented mathematically as follows:\nTranslation:\t$\\vec{p'} = \\vec{sp}$                        (8)\nRotation:\t$\\vec{p'} = \\vec{Rp}$                                       (9)\nScaling:\t$\\vec{p'} = \\vec{sp}$                                  (10)\nwhere $\\vec{p}$ and $\\vec{p'}$ are the original and transformed points, respectively, t is the translation vector, R is the rotation matrix, and s is the scaling factor. Mathematically, for a bounding box defined by its maximum extents $X_{max}$, $Y_{max}$, $Z_{max}$ and minimum extents $X_{min}$, $Y_{min}$, $Z_{min}$, its dimensions are calculated as:\n$X_{size} = X_{max} - X_{min}$                                                (11)\n$Y_{size} = Y_{max} - Y_{min}$                                                     (12)\n$Z_{size} = Z_{max} - Z_{min}$                                                (13)\nwhere $X_{size}$, $Y_{size}$ and $Z_{size}$ represent the dimensions of the model's bounding box in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.\nFor the maximum stock size, the method employs the same spatial transformations to encompass both additive and machining features, ensuring the entire volume needed is accurately identified. The global bounding box of the CAD model is determined to include all features, thereby ensuring that additional volumes necessary for additive features are considered. This approach aligns the final stock size with the comprehensive specifications of the part, considering its geometric complexities. By including the volumes for both subtractive and additive manufacturing elements, the process guarantees that the calculated stock size is precisely tailored to the manufacturing requirements."}, {"title": "3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "This study presents a novel method for recognizing hybrid manufacturing features and extracting dimensional attributes in CAD models. The proposed method bridges the gap between CAD designs and manufacturing processes by accurately identifying and characterizing features, including their dimensions, orientations, and stock sizes.\nA hybrid feature recognition model is developed using TensorFlow 2 and executed on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. The network's weights are initialized using the Xavier initialization method [28], and it includes six graph convolutional layers at each level of the GCNN model. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization [29] and dropout [30]. Dropout rate is maintained at 0.3 to prevent overfitting.

The ADAM optimizer [31] is used for optimization, and categorical cross-entropy [32] is employed for loss calculation. Each training batch consists of a variable number of hierarchical graphs, with the total number of vertices across all graphs in the batch being less than 5000. The dataset is split 60:20:20 for training, validation, and testing across 100 epochs. The dataset consists of 150,000 synthetic labeled CAD models with 29 distinct manufacturing feature classes. Each CAD model contains 4 to 8 manufacturing features. The classification accuracy of our model is calculated as [33]:\n$Accuracy = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$                                       (14)\nwhere TP, TN, FP, and FN are true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative, respectively.

The proposed method precisely identified, characterized, and quantified manufacturing features, effectively bridging the gap between CAD designs and manufacturing processes. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of CAD models with hybrid features, the graph convolutional neural network model achieved a feature recognition accuracy exceeding 97%.\nHowever, there are some limitations to this study. The accurate extraction of dimensional attributes is inherently dependent on the correct recognition of feature labels. An incorrect feature recognition leads to imprecise dimensional extraction, as the process relies on accurate initial feature identification. Furthermore, the dimension extraction process for intersecting features poses additional challenges, as it tends to analyze and extract dimensions of intersected features in sections, rather than as a unified feature.\nFor future work, we aim to refine the accuracy of recognizing and extracting dimensions for intersecting features, alongside enhancing the model to identify a broader range of machining and additive manufacturing features. Additionally, we plan to extend the proposed model's capabilities to calculate more detailed parameters such as surface area, normal vectors, and volume for each feature. Furthermore, we will combine the AFR model with a manufacturing decision-making system, creating an enhanced ecosystem that supports more informed and efficient manufacturing processes."}]}

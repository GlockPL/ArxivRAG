The creation of such diagnostic conversation datasets is promising to boost the AI mental healthcare community. However, directly collecting the conversations in real diagnosis scenarios is near impossible due to stringent privacy and ethical considerations. To address this issue, we seek to synthesize diagnostic conversation by exploiting anonymous patient cases that are easier to access. Specifically, we design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing the diagnostic conversation of mental disorders with large language models. It takes patient case as input and is capable of generating multiple diverse conversations with one single patient case. The framework basically involves the interaction between a doctor agent and a patient agent, and achieves text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree from a tool agent. By applying the proposed framework, we develop the largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k, which is built upon 1000 cleaned real patient cases by cooperating with a pioneering psychiatric hospital, and contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with diagnosis results as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first labelled Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset.

According to the statistics of World Health Organization (WHO), one in every eight people in the world lived with a mental disorder in 2019, and people living with anxiety and depressive disorders kept rising significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic (Organization et al. 2022). With the recent progress of large language models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al. 2022; OpenAI 2024), which emerges capabilities of relevant context incorporation and human-like text generation, many researchers turn to building conversational AI system for mental healthcare. Current implementations can be divided into two categories, finetuning a small model (e.g. Llama2-7B (Touvron et al. 2023)) with physician-patient conversations (EmoLLM 2024; Yang et al. 2024b; Liu et al. 2023) or building prompt-based physician-patient role-playing framework (Wang et al. 2024a; Zhang et al. 2024) with state-of-the-art language models (e.g. ChatGPT (Ouyang et al. 2022)). Regardless of the method employed, domain-specific mental health datasets play a fundamental and indispensable role.\nWe focus on diagnostic conversation dataset for mental disorders in this work. The clinical diagnosis of mental disorders differs from other diseases in that it primarily relies on the mental status examination of patients, which is reflected through conversations between psychiatrists and patients rather than physiological indices (First 2014). Therefore, the collection of mental disorders diagnostic conversation is promising to facilitate a variety of downstream tasks in AI mental health research like auxiliary diagnosis chatbot, mental disorders classification, etc. However, while many"}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "previous studies (Sun et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2023b) focused on emotional support or psychological counseling data, few work shed light on diagnostic conversations of mental disorders. This can be attributed to two main factors. First, diagnostic conversations in real scenarios are extremely hard to acquire due to the privacy and ethical consideration. Second, synthesizing diagnostic conversations from scratch is also challenging. Unlike psychological counseling or empathetic dialogue, diagnosis follows standardized process and requires professional medical knowledge. Consequently, directly employing LLMs for data synthesis in this context often yields poor outcomes (Tu et al. 2024). D\u2074 (Yao et al. 2022) made the first attempt by simulating diagnostic conversations with employed workers. However, it only covers depressive disorder and entirely depends on human annotation. The generated content is also short and far from similar to diagnostic conversations in real scenarios.\nWe propose a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework that takes patient cases as input to synthesize diagnostic conversations of mental disorders. The framework involves three types of large language model agents: a doctor agent, a patient agent, and a symbolic tool agent responsible for managing diagnostic topic shift. This framework features two major innovations: (i) One-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue generation that maximizes the utilization of precious real patient cases. As shown in Figure 1, unlike previous studies (Zhang et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024a) that generate one conversation with one patient case. Our proposed framework is capable of generating multiple diverse diagnostic conversations with one single patient case. Specifically, three methods ensure the diversity and correctness of diagnostic process. First, doctor agents with different diagnosis habits are designed and randomly selected for each conversation. Second, we use LLM with knowledge graph to generate multiple fictitious patient experiences based on one patient case. The patient experiences serve as background information for patient agents during generation. Since the diagnosis of mental disorders mainly relies on symptoms rather than concrete events, integrating the fictitious patient experiences enhances the diversity of synthesized conversation while maintaining the accuracy of the diagnostic process. Third, the sequence of diagnostic topics is randomly determined for each conversation. (ii) Another significant innovation lies in text generation under symbolic control via a dynamic diagnosis tree. This tree consists of a fixed symptom inquiry tree and a dynamic experience inquiry tree. Clinical diagnosis of mental disorders strictly follows standards from ICD-11 (Organization et al. 2018) or DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association et al. 2013). To simulate this process, we design the fixed symptom inquiry tree based on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) (First 2014), covering all the diagnostic topics for important symptoms inquiry. The experience inquiry tree is constructed by extracting possible topics from patient's response of past experiences. It's designed to establish deeper engagements with the patient.\nBy applying the proposed framework, we release the largest Chinese Mental Disorder Diagnosis dataset MDD-5k. It's also the first labelled mental disorders diagnostic conversation dataset with diagnosis results from professional psychiatrists. MDD-5k contains 5000 high-quality diagnostic conversations, with an averaged 26.8 turns and 6906.8 Chinese words per dialogue. It is built upon 1000 real patient cases from a pioneering psychiatric hospital, covering more than 25 different diseases. All the patient cases have been cleaned and filtered in accordance with global standards to ensure the complete protection of patient private information. The MDD-5k dataset will become publicly accessible when the ethical review finishes.\nThe contributions of this work can be summarized as:\n\u2022 We specially design a neuro-symbolic multi-agent framework for synthesizing diagnostic conversation of mental disorders, which features controllable and diverse one-to-many patientcase-to-dialogue generation.\n\u2022 The largest Chinese mental disorders diagnosis dataset MDD-5k is proposed, which contains 5000 high-quality long conversations with convincing diagnosis results as labels. To the best of our knowledge, it's also the first mental disorders diagnosis dataset with labels.\n\u2022 Comprehensive human evaluation shows the proposed MDD-5k dataset outperforms several compared datasets in professionalism, communication skills, fluency, safety, and mirrors human-like diagnostic process."}, {"title": "Mental Health Dataset", "content": "Corpora of physician-patient conversations focused on mental health are crucial for AI mental healthcare research, especially in the large language model era. We divide current mental health datasets into three categories based on the degree of required professional knowledge. Emotional support datasets feature empathetic dialogue and comfort. ESconv dataset (Liu et al. 2021) consists of 1300 conversations covering 10 topics. SoulChatCorpus (Chen et al. 2023b) contains over 2 million single-turn and multi-turn conversations generated by ChatGPT. Psychological counseling datasets typically contain more domain knowledge than common emotional support dataset. The Emotional First Aid Raw dataset (Wang 2024) is built by crawling from psychological counseling websites and communities. PsyQA (Sun et al. 2021) is a single-turn Chinese dataset annotated by human. SmileChat dataset (Qiu et al. 2024) expands PsyQA to multi-turn through ChatGPT. CPsyCounD (Zhang et al. 2024) contains 3134 counseling conversations generated by the same number of psychological counseling reports. Diagnosis datasets aim to simulate diagnostic conversation of professional psychiatrists. D\u2074 (Yao et al. 2022) is a Chinese depression diagnosis dataset built by human annotators and supervised by psychiatrists. There are also some medical dialogue datasets, like MedDialog (He et al. 2020), MTS-Dialog (Ben Abacha et al. 2023), ChatDoctor (Li et al. 2023), which encompass a broader range of medical fields."}, {"title": "Mental Disorders Conversation Simulation", "content": "We mainly focus on the tuning-free prompting frameworks for mental disorders conversation simulation.

Navigation is the critical function\nthat distinguishes them from stationary landers allowing them to investigate multi-\nple targets across versatile terrains. However, this comes at the expense of decreased\npayload mass, a lower energy capacity, and increased risk due to the traversal itself.\nIn the future, rovers equipped only with engineering sensors but without their own\nscientific instruments are a possibility. The Sample Fetching Rover (SFR), formerly\npart of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign, was an example for such a model.\nThe rover's purpose was to quickly navigate the Martian surface, locate sample tube\ncaches left behind by the Mars 2020 rover, and return them to the Mars Ascent vehi-\ncle. Rovers traverse unstructured terrains and can be neither repaired, nor moved or\notherwise reset into an operable state in case of fatal hardware failures. Hence, they\nrely on conservative planning by operators on Ground as well as their sensor suite and\non-board capabilities in more autonomous modes.\nThe sensors on which the operators as well as the rover base their planning can\nbe categorized as either (1) exteroceptive sensors, such as optical (stereo) cameras\nor time-of-flight cameras, or (2) proprioceptive sensors such as Inertial Measurement\nUnits (IMUs), fiber optic gyroscopes, or motor current. Force Torque Sensor (FTS)\nhave already reached a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) with example use\ncases in robotic manipulators, in terrestrial as well as space applications [1], and legged\nrobots. However, they are not commonly found on the locomotion systems of planetary,\nwheeled, rovers. This warrants closer investigation as there may be a signification\nopportunity for innovation.\nIn this paper, we explore the possibilities offered by the inclusion of FTSs in mobile,\nwheeled robot bases in planetary exploration. Our research aims to investigate how\nFTSs can enhance rover navigation in planetary scenarios. In July of 2023, we con-\nducted field trials using Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) (Figure 1),\none of the European Space Agency's rover testbeds [2], which is equipped with six\nATI mini45 FTSs, in the Bardenas Reales semi-desert, an analogue site to Mar-\ntian and Lunar exploration [3]. We evaluate the applications of the FTSs based on\nthese experiments, focusing on navigation and traversability-related tasks such as ter-\nrain classification and applicability for drawbar pull estimation with real data from\nunstructured terrain.\nIn MaRTA, the FTSs are mounted above the wheels rather than at the wheel hubs.\nThis is similar to the mounting position used by the 32 Degrees of Freedom (DoF)\nrobot RoboSimian [4, 5] which is primarily exploiting the vertical, gravity-aligned\nforces. This mounting choice and its trade-offs will be discussed in detail.\nThrough our field experiments with the MaRTA rover and the analyses in this\npaper, we offer an insight into practical challenges and potential applications of FTSs\nin planetary rover systems. Our findings provide guidance and pointers for researchers\nin determining the value of incorporating FTSs in their mobile robot bases, particularly\nin unstructured terrains. The main value of this paper consists of sharing insights into"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "This section explains work related to the different application areas of FTSs within\nrobotics.\nFTSs are widely used in manipulators, both on Earth and in space. On Earth,\nFTSs are used for force-torque control and compliance modes. This enables safer oper-\nation with a decreased risk of damaging components with which the robot interacts\nand enables higher tolerances in industrial applications [6]. The Perseverance rover\nfeatures an FTS on its sample caching mechanism for collision detection and active\nforce control [1]. In the ARCHES Analog 1 experiment on Mount Etna in 2022, the\nteam demonstrated the usefulness of FTS for operators and sample-picking tasks in\nLunar scenarios with astronauts in the loop [7].\nHowever, the use of FTSs for navigation purposes in planetary rover mobility\nsystems is less researched and needs further exploration. The principal use cases are\nmonitoring whether the wheel is stuck by comparing the motor current and torque\nat the wheel axle. In [8], the authors demonstrate how the experienced torque and\ncorrelated motor current can be used as indications of terrain interaction to extend a\nrover's mission lifetime. Later work investigates the use of FTSs at the axle for terrain\nclassification [9].\nTypically IMUs are used for terrain classification [10-13]. Note how in [10], the\nauthors place the IMU in the link connected to the wheel hub to detect specific vibra-\ntions related to the actuators. Other sensors used for classification include sound [14]\nand motor current [9]."}, {"title": "3 Terrain classification", "content": "In the literature, we saw that proprioceptive terrain classification was mainly tested\nfor straight traverses over flat terrains and constant speeds. In our test data, which\ncontained slopes, varying speeds (albeit within only 1 to 5cm/s), and turns, even\npoint turns, we could still classify the terrains between four major categories. Figure 2\nshows examples of the categories we considered.\nMaRTA's main components for this work can be seen in the simplified overview\nin Figure 3. Unlike single-wheel testbed setups, for example, where the FTSs are\ncommonly mounted at the wheel hub, MaRTA's FTSs are positioned above just above\nthe wheel bracket, between the wheel and the steering joint. The figure shows the"}, {"title": "3.1 Classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs)", "content": "The first method we used for classification is Support Vector Machines (SVMs). An\nSVM, or in this instance more precisely a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), finds a set\nof hyperplanes to best separate instances of different classes. Since SVM were originally\nconceived for binary classification, we use Scikit-Learn's SVC implementation\u00b9 which\nenables multi-class classification via either a \"one-vs-one\u201d or a \u201cone-vs-rest\" approach\n[32]. This means that an SVC for an N-class classification trains either $N \\cdot \\frac{N-1}{2}$ many\nclassifiers, each to distinguish between two classes, or N classifiers, each comparing\none class to all others.\nIn this section, we present a comparison of the prediction accuracies when using\nonly IMU, only FTS, and when using both IMU and FTS data. For each of these\ncases, we used Scikit-Learn [32] to setup a grid search over the most common SVC\nkernels and parameters:\n\u2022 C\u2208 {0.1, 1, 10, 100}\n\u2022 \u03b3\u2208 {1,0.1,0.01, 0.001}"}, {"title": "3.2 Classification with Neural Networks (NNs)", "content": "Using the same 1361 samples from above, we trained a simple neural network with\none hidden layer of 64 units, as shown in Figure 8.

[34] as well as Ishigami et al. [35] stipulate the relationship\nbetween drawbar pull, vertical and lateral forces, wheel radius, width, normal stress\nbeneath the wheel, shear stresses along the longitudinal and lateral wheel directions,\nthe entry and exit angle, reaction resistances, and the angle to the principal ground\ncontact point. Note that wheel deformation and dynamics are not mentioned yet, but\nwe can already see the interest in finding a direct way to measure the drawbar pull\ninstead of inferring it from these, mostly, external factors. Instead, with a known draw-\nbar pull, we could use statistical approaches to inform about some of those unknown\nground parameters [35].\nThe influence of both vibrations and noise renders it difficult to or in parts even\ninhibits us from interpreting force and torque signal over the entire traverses. The\nestimated drawbar pull could sometimes vary between tens of Newtons within seconds\neven for flat terrains and straight traverses. Instead, we propose to filter the measured\ndata using the known rover geometry.\nWe know that the normal distance from the FTS to the ground contact point is\n0.175 m and that the distance between the sensor and the wheel axle is 0.1m (see\nFigure 10). We can view this subsystem as a lever of length L of 0.1 to 0.175 m\n(Equation 1), depending on where exactly ground contact is made, where the torque\nat the FTS, $T_y$, depends on the horizontal force and the vertical distance to the contact\npoint.\n$T_y = F_x L$                                                      (1)\nThe principal assumptions are a rigid linkage between the sensor and the wheel,\na rigid wheel, steering straight on a flat terrain, no sinkage, and no grousers. The\nterrains that we traversed did not show large sinkage, but to account for the real\nterrain and system, in this first attempt, we propose to use a generous threshold while"}, {"title": "5 Conclusions", "content": "We have presented the different use cases for Force Torque Sensors (FTSs) on mobile\nrobot bases in the context of planetary exploration. A rover testbed equipped with\nsix FTSs as well as a more traditional Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was used in\na field test to evaluate the applicability of the sensors for these scenarios.\nMounting the FTSs above the wheel potentially simplifies wiring and maintenance.\nThe main argument for mounting the FTSs above the wheel is the additional char-\nacterization of alternative locomotion modes such as wheel walking, where the use of\nthe deployment/walking joints is of interest. However, to gain more insights into the\ninteraction between the rover and the terrain while driving, we recommend installing\nthem in the drive hub and correlating them with the motor current. This allows for a\nmore direct measurement of the effort at the wheel.\nWorking with the sensor data captured during long traverses over varying terrain\ntypes, slopes, and at varying speeds, we have experienced that drawbar pull cannot\nimmediately be read from the FTS in a meaningful way. We have, however, identified\na candidate approach for identifying time intervals in which the drawbar pull could\nbe derived from the force-torque sensors. Additionally, the proposed approach has a\ngeometrical meaning such that its parameters can be inferred from the rover's legs.\nNote though that the confirmation and tuning of additional filtering could not be done\nwith field test data alone. For this, we would need to design experiments with external\nground-truth measurements of the drawbar pull.\nWhile invaluable for use in manipulators, the case for FTSs in the wheeled mobile\nbase is harder to argue. In more controlled environments such as single wheel testbeds,\nthey prove useful, but as the vibrations are superimposed on the signals, the FTSS\nbecome harder to interpret as drawbar pull estimations. Having gone through these\ntrials ourselves, we recommend foregoing comparatively costly FTSs and rather use\ncheaper and conventional sensors in their stead. Especially if the rover in question only\nuses more traditional driving modes. For slip detection, we will choose current sensors\nin the future or at least mount the FTSs in the wheel hub itself instead of above the\nwheel. For terrain classification, the FTSs proved better than the IMU, but we believe\nthat this can be mitigated by using an additional IMU as discussed earlier. The main\nremaining argument for the existing FTS configuration we see, is that wheel walking\nperformance could theoretically be evaluated based on only one instead of two FTSS\nper leg."}, {"title": "6 Future work", "content": "We have explored the most prominent use cases of FTSs for rover navigation above,\nbut we see additional tasks that should be explored in the future to fully exploit the\nsensor mounting location for rover navigation.\nAs demonstrated in the section about drawbar pull, we have identified a candidate\nfor selecting valid time intervals. This needs to be confirmed and supported by addi-\ntional filtering by tests with ground-truth data. The tests should include an external\nmeasurement of drawbar pull, different, defined slopes with known ground parameters,\na wheel with and without grousers, and a complete formulation of rover kinematics\nand dynamics. The latter is especially interesting for planetary rovers which typically\nfeature articulated bogies and steering joints.\nThe orientation of the rover, roll and pitch in particular, could be estimated using\nthe force torque data. This estimate can then be compared to IMU data and current\nkinematics transformations to get a more complete image of the rover configuration\nand inform the confidence estimates of individual sensors for any sensor fusion.\nFor configurations such as the ExoMars rover [26], the exerted torques at the\ndeployment actuators are of interest, specifically during wheel walking analysis [23, 24].\nAgain, this can be measured directly at the joint, but if we want to measure both at\nthis joint and at the drive, we would end up with two sensors. In the MaRTA rover,\nwhich is a half-scale model of ExoMars, however, the decision was taken to install only\none FTS per leg which could still deliver approximations for both deployment/walking\nand driving, yielding indicative results for both.\nTo validate the applicability of the FTS in MaRTA's configuration for determining\nthe drawbar pull, a single-wheel testbed should be equipped with an FTS about the\nwheel and the real drawbar pull measured for different terrains. An additional diffi-\n      culty in determining the drawbar pull contribution of each wheel consists in the rover\nconfiguration and pose. As can be seen in Figure 3, each wheel can have its own pose\ninstead of always being aligned with the rover chassis. This is in addition to the chas-\nsis orientation and steering angles. This could also lead to the integration of traction\ncontrol."}, {"title": "Statements and declarations", "content": "Data availability\nThis paper is based on the dataset from our Bardenas field test, BASEPROD.

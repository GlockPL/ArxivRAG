First we show that Axiom (A2) is valid on every frame that satisfies Property (P * 2). Fix a model based on a frame that satisfies Property (P * 2), arbitrary s \u2208 S, \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6\u2080 and s\u2032 \u2208 B(s); we need to show that s\u2032 \u22a8 (\u03c6 > \u03c6). If ||\u03c6|| = \u00d8, then, by (a) of Item 5 of Definition 3.1, s\u2032 \u22a8 (\u03c6 > \u03c6). If ||\u03c6|| \u2260 0 then, by Property (P * 2), f(s\u2032, ||\u03c6||) \u2286 ||\u03c6|| and thus, by (b) of Item 5 of Definition 3.1, s\u2032 \u22a8 (\u03c6 > \u03c6).\nNext we show that Axiom (A2) is not valid on a frame that violates Property (P * 2). Fix such a frame, that is, a frame where there exist s \u2208 S, \u00d8 \u2260 E \u2286 S and s\u2032 \u2208 B(s) such that f(s\u2032, E) \u2288 E. Let p \u2208 At be an atomic formula and construct a model based on this frame where ||p|| = E \u2260 \u00d8. Then, since f(s\u2032, ||p||) \u2288 ||p||, s\u2032 \u22ad (p > p) and thus s \u22ad B(p > p) so that axiom (A2) is not valid on the given frame.\nProposition 2.

First we show that Axiom (A3) is valid on every frame that satisfies Property (P * 3). Fix a model based on a frame that satisfies Property (P * 3), arbitrary s \u2208 S and \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6\u2081 and suppose that s \u22a8 \u00ac\u25a1\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 B(\u03c6 > \u03c8). We need to show that s \u22a8 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8). Since s \u22a8 \u00ac\u25a1\u00ac\u03c6, ||\u03c6|| \u2260 \u00d8. Thus, since s \u22a8 B(\u03c6 > \u03c8), \u2200s\u2032 \u2208 B(s), f(s\u2032, ||\u03c6||) \u2286 ||\u03c8||.

If s\u2032 \u2208 ||\u03c6||, then by Property (P * 3), s\u2032 \u2208 \u222a_{x \u2208 B(s)} f(x, ||\u03c6||) and thus, by (1), s\u2032 \u2208 ||\u03c8||, so that s\u2032 \u22a8 \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8. Hence s \u22a8 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8).\nNext we show that Axiom (A3) is not valid on a frame that violates Property (P * 3). Fix such a frame, that is, a frame where there exist s \u2208 S, \u00d8 \u2260 E \u2286 S and s\u2032 \u2208 B(s) such that s\u2032 \u2208 E but s\u2032 \u2209 \u222a_{x \u2208 B(s)} f(x, E).

Then s\u2032 \u22a8 p but s\u2032 \u22ad q, so that s\u2032 \u22ad p \u2192 q, from which it follows that s \u22ad B(p \u2192 q), that is, s \u22a8 \u00acB(p \u2192 q). To obtain a violation of (A3) it only remains to show that s \u22a8 \u00ac\u25a1\u00acp \u2227 B(p > q). That s \u22a8 \u00ac\u25a1\u00acp is a consequence of the fact that, by hypothesis, \u00d8 \u2260 E = ||p||. Furthermore, since ||p|| \u2260 \u00d8 and ||q|| = \u222a_{x \u2208 B(s)} f(x, ||p||), for every y \u2208 B(s), f(y,||p||) \u2286 ||q|| and therefore y \u22a8 (p > q), so that s \u22a8 B(p > q).\nProposition 3.

First we show that Axiom (A4) is valid on every frame that satisfies Property (P * 4). Fix a model based on a frame that satisfies Property (P * 4), an arbitrary s \u2208 S and arbitrary \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a6\u2080 and suppose that s \u22a8 \u00acB\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8). We need to show that s \u22a8 B(\u03c6 > \u03c8). Since s \u22a8 \u00acB\u00ac\u03c6, there exists an s\u2032 \u2208 B(s) such that s\u2032 \u22a8 \u03c6, that is, B(s) \u2229 ||\u03c6|| \u2260 \u00d8. Thus, by Property (P * 4), \u2200s\u2032 \u2208 B(s), f(s\u2032, ||\u03c6||) \u2286 B(s) \u2229 ||\u03c8||.\nSince s \u22a8 B(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8), B(s) \u2286 ||\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8|| = ||\u00ac\u03c6|| \u222a ||\u03c8||.

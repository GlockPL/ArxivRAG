While politeness has robust existing tools and data, face acts are less re- sourced. We introduce a new corpus created by annotating Wikipedia talk pages with face acts and we use this to train a face act tagger. We then employ our framework to study how face and politeness interact with gender and power in discussions between Wikipedia edi- tors. Among other findings, we observe that female Wikipedians are not only more polite, which is consistent with prior studies, but that this difference corresponds with significantly more language directed at humbling aspects of their own face. Interestingly, the distinction nearly vanishes once limiting to editors with administrative power.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Brown and Levinson (1987) (henceforth B&L) in- troduce an influential theory of politeness based on the concept of face, which they claim to be cultur- ally universal. In this theory, face \u2013 i.e. the public image one seeks to claim \u2013 is a two-sided coin. Agents attend to their desire to have their wants appreciated, which they call positive face, as well as a complementary desire to act unimpeded and maintain freedom, which they call negative face. The face of every agent is ensnared with that of every other agent \u2013 agents cannot have their desires appreciated if they cannot appreciate the desires of others. As a result, utterances can raise (+) or threaten (-) the positive (Pos) or negative (Neg) face of the speaker (S) or hearer (H). A face threat or face raising is not a property of particular linguistic choices, but of communicative intent. If I want to request information from you, then I necessarily need to threaten your negative face, since, if I am successful in communicating my request to you, I will oblige you to answer and thus I will restrict your choice of actions. In B&L's theory, discourse participants may choose among various strategies for minimizing threats to face. These strategies are linguistic strategies (for example, using hedges), and the choice of strategy depends on many factors such as cultural conven- tions and the discourse situation (who is talking to whom under what circumstances). Work related to NLP has concentrated on study- ing linguistic manifestations of politeness (Walker et al., 1997; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013) while largely disregarding the notion of face act. While B&L are frequently cited, the deep insight of their theory comes from a complexity which has been ignored. Their theory is not simply about politeness, but about how politeness, situated in the context of rational action, manifests from a combination of performing face acts to achieve certain goals and using mitigation strategies to lessen the impact of face-threatening acts. Danescu- Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) use politeness mark- ers inspired by B&L strategies as features for a system which predicts perceived politeness with- out modeling face acts. Dutt et al. (2020) pre- dict face acts in isolation from perceived polite- ness. In this paper, we re-examine the Wikipedia Talk Pages Corpus (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2020) and demonstrate how bringing face acts and politeness together provides deeper insight. We do this by producing an annotation of face acts on the corpus and training a new model to label utterances. We then use this tool, along with prior systems which produce judgements of perceived politeness, to label roughly 1.3 million sentences from Wikipedia talk pages. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply an annotation grounded in politeness theory to a text corpus of this scale. The paper is structured as follows. We start with a review of relevant literature (\u00a72) and present our"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The theory of politeness of B&L has found applica- tions in many fields including sociology, psychol- ogy, and linguistics. Google Scholar lists nearly 38,000 citations. Curiously, in NLP there has not been much work building explicitly on B&L. Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) concentrate on one type of face-threatening act (FTA), namely the negative face-threatening act of a request, and investigate the strategies used for doing this FTA. To do this, they use crowd sourcing to rate the requests on a politeness scale. They develop a model which predicts the politeness of these re- quests and use it to study the interactions between users on Wikipedia and StackExchange. Ziems et al. (2023) show that fine-tuning on the data of Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) substan- tially outperforms zero-shot approaches. The face acts (FAs) themselves are the object of Dutt et al. (2020). In addition to developing a dataset annotated with FAs, they present a FA clas- sifier based on a neural architecture they devise on top of BERT, which achieves 69% F-measure (0.60 macro). As the data involves participants convinc- ing others to donate to a charity, they also use this corpus to investigate the relationship between face acts and persuasion by predicting if a participant chose to donate. This corpus, which we refer to as the \"CMU Face Acts Corpus\" (or \u201cCMU Corpus\" for short) in this paper, is the direct inspiration for our annotation effort on the Wikipedia data. We dif- fer from their annotation scheme in some important details; we present our annotation in \u00a74. In prior work, we investigated the interaction of intention (through dialog act tagging) and face acts in the CMU Corpus (Soubki and Rambow, 2024). There has been an explosion work in compu-"}, {"title": "3 Theoretical Framework", "content": "In this section we provide a brief summary of rele- vant concepts from politeness theory as it relates to our work. Our goal in this paper is to explore how face acts contribute to the perception of politeness. For B&L, \"face\" refers to the public self-image of agents, and it is a universal component of human in- teraction. It consists of two complementary facets (Brown and Levinson, 1987, \u00a73.1, p. 61). (1) nega- tive face: \"the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, rights to non-distraction \u2013 i.e. to free- dom of action and freedom from imposition.\" (2) positive face: \"the positive consistent self-image or 'personality' (crucially including the desire that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactants.\" A face act is an intentional communicative act which inherently interacts with the face of the speaker and/or addressees (Brown and Levinson, 1987, \u00a73.2, p. 65). Face acts can threaten (-) or"}, {"title": "4 Face Act Tagging", "content": "In this section we outline the data, modeling tech- niques, and evaluation measures used in developing our face act tagger for Wikipedia talk pages.\nOn Wikipedia, talk pages are used by editors to coordinate changes and improvements to the ency- clopedia. A variety of social and power dynamics are at play in these conversations which can range from discussions of bureaucratic process to heated, and sometimes personal, conflicts. The Wikipedia Talk Pages Corpus (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012) collects 125,292 exchanges between 38,462 editors resulting in a total of 391,294 posts for anal- ysis. Unlike the CMU Face Acts Corpus, where participants are on mostly level ground, editors can hold administrative privileges or greater notoriety\nSimilar to the CMU Corpus, we use the criteria out- lined by B&L, which serves as our reference. The CMU Corpus annotation guidelines, as the authors noted, contain some departures from politeness the- ory. In particular, the CMU Corpus annotates both thanking and complimenting as AGREEMENT. In contrast, B&L analyze thanking and compliment- ing as INDEBTEDNESS and IMPOSITION, respec- tively. We choose to remain faithful to B&L, and in fact assert this to be a critical piece of the theory. Consider a compliment such as you have a lovely smile. How is it that a compliment can be taken so poorly by the addressee if the speaker is not risking anything? They are often very risky social acts because the speaker assumes they are among the people their addressee wishes to be complimented by; a very imposing assumption. Thanking, on the other hand, can be seen as an exchange of currency. Similar to writing an IOU, the speaker offers a to- ken of their freedom to the addressee. We note that we expect future versions of face act annotations to annotate multiple face acts at once, which may resolve this difference between the CMU Corpus annotation style and ours. We randomly selected 200 conversations from the WikiTalks data for manual annotation. As the posts contain multiple sentences, each with the pos- sibility of their own face act, we segment the sen- tences prior to annotation using spaCy (Honnibal and Johnson, 2015). To reduce errors in segmenta- tion, we scrubbed hypertext tags and masked any remaining urls. This resulted in 1850 sentences. We will refer to these basic units of annotation as \"utterances\" in the following sections. Two of the authors annotated the 1850 utterances for face acts. We examined 100 utterances labeled by both an- notators and computed a Cohen's Kappa of 0.69 which indicates moderate to substantial agreement.\nWe model face act tagging as a text classifica- tion task. Given a sequence of n utterances S = [t1, t2,..., tn], we wish to assign a label y \u2208 Y where Y represents a set containing the 8 possible face acts and one additional label for no face act. Recently, many classification tasks have achieved stronger results using parameter effi- cient fine-tuning methods of larger models rather than full fine-tuning smaller ones (Hu et al., 2022; Dettmers et al., 2024). We adopt this approach and use Llama-3-8B (AI@Meta, 2024) and LoRA with Int8 quantization (Dettmers et al., 2022) for fine- tuning. Details of the configuration are given in Appendix A. While fine-tuning approaches unify many aspects of the model design, they present challenges when it comes to determining effective input and output representations. We provide the models an input which contains an utterance prefixed with the Wikipedia username of the discourse participants, along with previous utterances as context. Each utterance is followed by a newline character. We give an example with two lines of context, though in our experiments we use more, as discussed just below.\nThe target output is a distribution where the high- est probability is given to the correct label for the final utterance of the input text, in this case HPos-(DISAGREEMENT). We experimented with differ- ent output formats, and found they do not make much of a difference. In our experiments we no- ticed context to be a critical factor with the optimal size varying by model. Llama 3 performed best with a size of four, for a total of five utterances. As there are no previous turns for the first four turns in each dialog, those examples are provided in a similar format containing only three, two, one or no lines of context."}, {"title": "5 Application and Analysis", "content": "We apply our new face act tagger along with the po- liteness scores provided by ConvoKit (Chang et al., 2020) to study the interactions of face and polite-\nOn Wikipedia, editors with administrative status wield significant power in the community including the ability to block or unblock users by IP address and delete or restore pages. This increased sta- tus is known to be recognized in the community (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Burke and Kraut, 2008; Leskovec et al., 2010) which endows editors with these powers through public elections. We note that politeness theory anticipates speakers with greater social power than their addressee to more often select strategies that reduce ambiguity and lengthiness. This means opting to perform face threatening acts more often (as opposed to avoiding them all together) and mitigating them through the trade-offs of strategies less often, which one would expect to correspond with a perception of being less polite overall. We divide utterances by their politeness score into the polite utterances (top 25%), neutral (next 50%) and impolite (bottom 25%). When compar-\ning politeness between admins and non-admins we see the same trend as observed by Danescu- Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013). Utterances pro- duced by editors with administrative privileges (\"admins\") are not more often impolite, however they are significantly (p < 0.001 using the Mann- Whitney U test) less frequently polite, with a mean score difference of 3. Additionally the frequency by which admins produce polite posts is also sig- nificantly (p < 0.001) lower resulting in messages which are deemed polite 5% less often compared to non-admin editors. When looking at the distributional differences in face acts by adminship this decrease in politeness corresponds with small, but salient variations. Admins are significantly (p < 0.001) less likely to express INDEBTEDNESS (e.g. thanking, accepting offers) and APOLOGIES (e.g., admitting mistakes, confessions). Though admins produce more utterances labeled AGREEMENT (e.g. appreciation, seeking common ground, group cohesion), their AGREEMENT utterances are significantly (p < 0.001) less often (-4% absolute) perceived as polite compared to AGREE- MENT utterances by non-admins. Similarly, while non-admins do more IMPOSITION (e.g. issuing commands, making requests), their IMPOSITION utterances are significantly (p < 0.05) more often (+3% absolute) taken politely compared to IMPOSITION utterances by admins.. This shows, as we anticipated, that face acts do not imply politeness, contrary to possible intuition.\nWe explore whether the experience and productiv- ity of the editor is another means to achieve in- creased social power without the explicit additional privileges the \"admin\" title confers. To investigate this we categorize users by the number of edits they have made and label users in the top and bot- tom quartiles \"experienced\u201d and \u201cinexperienced\", respectively.\nSome editors self-identify their gender on their user page allowing us to study communicative differ- ences along this axis as well. Prior work found female Wikipedians to be generally more polite (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013) which is consistent with studies in several domains. We also observe this, with utterances by women scoring more polite (+5, p < 0.001), more often (+7%, p < 0.0001). When comparing the distribution of face acts we see several disparities that the polite- ness scores alone do not convey. In general, the NONE category is lower for women, i.e. female Wikipedians are more likely, and perhaps more willing, to interact with face in their utterances. When doing so, they humble their own positive face (APOLOGIES, e.g. admitting mistakes, making confessions, accepting compliments) and their own negative face (INDEBTEDNESS, e.g. thanking, ac- cepting apologies) more often than men. This self- deference is accompanied by fewer impositions on their addressee's face (IMPOSITION, e.g. requests, commands, insults, criticism) and more attention to the hearer's own wants (AGREEMENT, e.g. seeking common ground, showing respect). Unlike when looking at admins, these AGREEMENT utterances are less frequently judged to be impolite. These trends have been observed in various prior studies (Lakoff, 1973; Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2017; Herring, 1994).\nWe have seen that male Wikipedians are less polite, more distant with regards to face, and more likely to express IMPOSITION (\u00a75.3). Similarly, much of the same is true when comparing admins to non- admins (\u00a75.1). How do these factors interact?

Through several methods of analysis we demon- strate the usefulness of examining perceived polite- ness in combination with face acts by reporting a number of findings based on their interaction. In future work we plan to allow multiple face acts per utterance (including for the same segment), and to incorporate the strategy (as conceived of by B&L) more explicitly into our modeling framework."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "The principal scientific limitation of this work is that we could only consider three aspects of the larger model of B&L: face acts, the communicative setting (gender and power), and perceived polite- ness. The major missing elements in the full frame- work include intention, communicative intention, social norms, and strategies. We intend this paper to be a first step towards a fuller implementation of an explicit cognitive theory of communication which involves all of the mentioned elements. The experiments for this work were performed using computational resources that are not, in gen- eral, freely available. In part due to these compu- tational requirements, but also a result of minimal data, we were not able to evaluate the techniques on additional languages and acknowledge the limi- tations this places on extending our results to other cultures. We also note along similar lines that while Brown and Levinson (1987) claim their theory of politeness to be culturally universal, this claim has been contested \u2013 most notably for eastern cultures (Al-Duleimi et al., 2016). As discussed in detail above, taking utterances to have a single face act or intent is a critically limiting assumption which lends some uncertainty to our conclusions. We note that while many of the linguistic dif- ferences observed were consistent across multi- ple rounds of analysis and significant using the Mann-Whitney U test, the effect sizes were gener- ally small. The conclusions should be interpreted with that in mind."}, {"title": "Ethics Statement", "content": "Despite an analysis of the errors, we cannot ver- ify the safety of this system in any user-oriented context and therefore do not recommend such uses without further study.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have revolutionized various sectors, including industry, public services, and society at large. The advent of deep learning (DL) has been particularly transformative, enabling AI systems to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition at a level that often matches or surpasses human capabilities [1], [2]. Central to the success of DL is the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which drives learning by iteratively adjusting the weights of neural networks to minimize prediction errors. Despite its effectiveness, BP's computational intensity and its lack of alignment with biological learning mechanisms have spurred the search for alternative methods that can function in resource-constrained environments while more closely mirroring natural learning processes [3], [4]. In response to these challenges, research has increasingly focused on developing approaches that approximate the efficiency of BP while mitigating its limitations. Self-supervised learning, which enables models to learn from data without explicit labels, represents one such advancement. Additionally, algorithms like Feedback Alignment and Direct Feedback Alignment address BP's spatial non-locality and weight transport issues, offering promising alternatives [9], [10]. Furthermore, techniques such as predictive coding and equilibrium propagation propose more biologically plausible models of learning by reducing the reliance on non-local computations [11], [12].\nHowever, these alternative approaches often entail a trade-off between accuracy and biological plausibility, particularly when applied to complex datasets like ImageNet. The quest for algorithms that can achieve high performance without the limitations of end-to-end BP has led to the development of sophisticated models that incorporate local plasticity rules and auxiliary networks, albeit with increased complexity [8]. The ongoing debate over the viability of BP as a model for brain learning has highlighted significant practical and biophysical challenges, further questioning the extent to which BP aligns with the brain's learning mechanisms. This skepticism has catalyzed interest in brain-inspired computing, which seeks to develop computational models that more accurately reflect the brain's learning processes [5]. Among the promising avenues in this field are predictive coding and the forward-forward algorithm, which offer potential pathways to bridging the gap between artificial learning systems and the intricacies of bio-logical neural networks. These approaches not only challenge our understanding of artificial systems but also deepen our insights into the cognitive processes that govern learning and intelligence in the natural world [12]. As AI and ML continue to evolve, spearheaded by advancements in deep learning and convolutional neural networks, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new era of technological innovation. Yet, the pursuit of algorithms that harmonize efficiency, accuracy, and biological fidelity remains ongoing, driving the exploration of alternatives to traditional models like backpropagation. In this context, saliency maps have emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs). These maps provide a visual representation of the elements that significantly influence a model's decisions, thereby offering insights into the internal workings of DNNs. By assigning scores to different input features based on their impact on the model's output, gradient-based saliency techniques help to clarify the decision-making processes within the network [14], [15]. This enhanced transparency is critical in applications where interpretability is essential, such as healthcare, neuroscience,"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Recent advances in deep learning underscore the efficacy of stochastic gradient descent applied to models with expansive parameter spaces and significant data volumes. Central to this process is backpropagation [30], which computes gradients essential for training. Despite its widespread adoption, the biological plausibility of backpropagation remains a topic of debate. Scholars question whether similar mechanisms exist in the human brain for synaptic weight adjustment [27], [28]. Yet, there is no conclusive evidence that the cortex employs mechanisms akin to error derivative propagation or reverses computation phases. Further complicating this hypothesis, the brain's cortical connections form complex loops rather than the hierarchical structures typical of backpropagation, posing challenges for its biological feasibility, especially in processing sequential data [27]. Additionally, the brain's ongoing processing of sensory information without pausing for error correction suggests an alternative, dynamic learning strategy that adjusts synapses in real-time, contrasting sharply with the sequential nature of backpropagation. The opacity introduced in the forward pass of deep neural networks (DNNs) also complicates gradient derivation, necessitating alternative models that can manage non-differentiable elements [28].\nDeep learning has profoundly impacted various sectors by enabling the extraction of complex patterns from extensive datasets, leading to precise predictions and informed decision-making [3]. This issue is critical in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous driving, where decisions must be both accurate and interpretable [6], [7], [21]. Addressing these challenges, significant research efforts have focused on developing methods to enhance DNN interpretability. These include using saliency maps to identify influential input features, although their effectiveness can be diminished by noise and other artifacts [14], [15]. Techniques such as SmoothGrad and Integrated Gradients have been introduced to refine these visualizations by averaging the effects of noise or modifying gradient functions to offer deeper insights into decision processes [13], [16], [22]. SMOOT [25] builds upon these saliency-based methods by introducing a novel approach that optimizes the number of masked images during training, significantly improving both model accuracy and the prominence of salient features. This work demonstrates how careful adjustment of the masking strategy can prevent information loss and enhance interpretability without sacrificing predictive performance. Research has shown that there is often a trade-off between noise and power consumption in various systems [17], highlighting the importance of optimizing both to improve system performance. Similarly, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially in underwater environments, efficient data routing is vital for minimizing resource consumption while ensuring reliable communication. Recent work [19] has introduced a method that optimizes network performance by integrating multi-criteria decision-making with uncertainty weights, thereby enhancing underwater IoT communications.\nThe pursuit of robust interpretability not only aims to clarify model decisions but also seeks to understand the representations learned by DNNs. Exploring methods like network distillation into interpretable models, such as soft decision trees, presents promising directions for enhancing transparency in machine learning applications [18].\nThe Forward-Forward Algorithm represents a novel approach in the domain of neural network learning, particularly when dealing with unidentified nonlinearities. It eliminates the need for traditional reinforcement learning by allowing networks to learn directly from sequential data without storing neural activities or interrupting error propagation. This algo-rithm operates comparably to backpropagation but does not require an in-depth understanding of the forward computational steps. However, it marginally lags behind backpropagation in terms of speed when tested across various toy problems, suggesting that its utility may be limited in scenarios where com-putational resources are ample [20]. Despite these limitations, the Forward-Forward Algorithm holds potential advantages for modeling cortical learning processes and could be better suited for use in low-power analog hardware, avoiding the com-plexities of reinforcement learning. Its foundational concept is influenced by mechanisms from Boltzmann machines [23] and Noise Contrastive Estimation [24], employing two forward passes instead of the traditional forward and backward passes. Each pass targets distinct datasets with diametrically opposed objectives: the first, or 'positive' pass, processes real data to increase a 'goodness' measure across each layer, while the second, or 'negative' pass, uses synthetic or 'negative' data to decrease this measure. The algorithm's efficacy is gauged through two specific measures of 'goodness' the sum of squared neural activities and its inverse. This dual-process aims to refine the model's ability to classify input vectors as positive or negative data based on a logistic function, $\u03c3$, applied to the difference between the goodness measure and a predefined threshold, $\u03b8$:\n$p(positive) = \u03c3(\\sum_i (S^2)_i - \u03b8)$"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "In the context of saliency analysis, we employ an alternative approach due to the inherent limitations of the forward propagation algorithm, notably its lack of backpropagation as found in conventional neural networks. Our method focuses on quantifying the influence of individual pixels on the model's performance by systematically nullifying their contribution. This is achieved by applying a filter to the image, which iteratively moves across the entire image. For each position of the filter, pixels within its scope are set to zero, effectively removing their influence. Subsequently, we assess the model's accuracy without the contribution of these pixels. This process is repeated for every pixel position, with the pixel under the filter's center being the subject of analysis each time. By com-paring the model's accuracy with and without the influence of each pixel, we derive a differential accuracy for each pixel. The aggregation of these differential accuracies forms a difference matrix, which serves as a visual representation of the impact each pixel has on the model's overall accuracy. This difference matrix thus provides insightful data on the saliency within the image, highlighting regions of particular importance to the model's decision-making process."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS", "content": "In this section, we assess the performance of our method on the MNIST [29] and Fashion-MNIST [26] datasets. Both datasets consist of images with dimensions of 28 \u00d7 28 pixels. These images were converted into a flattened format to form an input layer with 784 units. All computational experiments were performed using an NVIDIA T4 GPU, equipped with 2,560 CUDA cores, 320 Tensor cores, and 16 GB of GDDR6 memory.\nWe conducted several experiments to showcase the forward-forward algorithm in image classification. We used two linear layers for the MLP architecture with a hidden layer size of 500. The MLP model was trained for 5,000 epochs. In the forward-forward algorithm, each layer learns independently, starting with the first layer and proceeding sequentially through the others.\nFor our new technique, titled \"The Accuracy Differential Saliency (ADS) Technique,\u201d we applied it to the MNIST dataset to assess the impact of individual pixels on model accuracy. This was achieved by systematically nullifying them using a moving filter. The technique creates a differential matrix that contrasts the model's performance with and without the contribution of each pixel, thereby identifying critical regions that influence decision-making. The outcomes are illustrated by overlaying this matrix onto the image."}, {"title": "V.

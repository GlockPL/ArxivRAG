Introduction", "content": "Graph theory-based analysis serves as a robust tool to quantitatively describe the topological characteristics of brain networks[1]. This method has been widely applied in brain imaging research, revealing an \"economical\" small-world organization in brain networks, where an efficient balance between network cost and efficiency is maintained. Additionally, the brain connectome exhibits a modular and rich-club organization, which is crucial for the transmission and communication of neural signals. Studies have shown that brain disorders can alter graph metrics and the structure of brain networks. However, most research has focused on single-modality brain imaging data, limiting a more comprehensive understanding of brain connectivity[2]. Thus, integrating multiple modalities, especially EEG and fMRI, offers a deeper understanding of brain dynamics and network topology[3].\nEEG and fMRI are two complementary imaging techniques used to study brain activity[4]. fMRI has good spatial resolution and captures hemodynamic responses across the entire brain, but its temporal resolution is relatively low. On the other hand, EEG measures cortical electrical activity with high temporal resolution, but it has lower spatial resolution. Combining both signals is an effective way to study brain dynamics across broader spatial and temporal scales. Previous research has found that the low-frequency connectivity detected by EEG closely resembles brain connectivity observed in fMRI, shedding light on the electrophysiological basis of functional brain connectivity[5].\nNeurofeedback (NF) is a technique that helps individuals regulate brain activity through real-time feedback and is commonly used in rehabilitation and the treatment of mental health disorders[6]. Both EEG and fMRI are non-invasive functional brain imaging methods used in neurofeedback. EEG offers millisecond-level temporal resolution, enabling real-time monitoring of electrical brain activity, while fMRI reflects neurovascular activity through BOLD signals and provides high spatial resolution. Although fMRI has been widely used in neurofeedback, its high cost and operational complexity limit frequent use in clinical settings. As a result, EEG-based neurofeedback has gained attention due to its convenience and flexibility. In recent years, simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI has been used to explore connections in different brain states, further expanding the applications of multimodal measurements[7].\nIn this study, the graph theory properties of multimodal EEG-fMRI brain connectivity were explored. By using simultaneously collected open- and closed-eye data, brain graphs were constructed in both static and dynamic states, combining the high spatial resolution of fMRI and the high temporal resolution of EEG. This approach offers a new framework that integrates the different information from EEG and fMRI within a graph theory model, providing a more comprehensive representation of the brain's dynamic connectivity organization[8]."}, {"title": "II. Method", "content": "We recruited 25 healthy participants (age: 29 \u00b1 8 years; 8 females) through advertisements and word of mouth. All individuals had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing.[9] Prior to inclusion in the study, participants underwent screening to ensure the absence of any DSM-IV Axis I or Axis II psychopathology, assessed through a structured interview, as well as no history of neurological disorders. Each participant provided informed written consent for the study, and they were compensated for their participation. The experimental design and details regarding simultaneous data collection have been previously described.\nEEG-fMRI data were recorded simultaneously while participants first rested with their eyes closed (for 8.5 minutes), followed by resting with their eyes open (for another 8.5 minutes). During each session, participants were instructed to relax, remain still and quiet, and stay awake throughout the recording[10].\nEEG data were collected using a 32-channel system compatible with MR environments and a specialized electrode cap. The Ag/AgCl electrodes were arranged based on the international 10-20 standard. Separate channels recorded ECG and EOG signals, limiting the number of scalp electrodes to 30. The reference electrode was positioned at FCz. Conductive paste ensured that the impedance of each electrode remained below 5 \u039a\u03a9. \u0395EG signals were sampled at a rate of 5 kHz, and synchronization between the EEG amplifier and the fMRI system was achieved using an internal device to avoid timing discrepancies.\nFunctional MRI brain images were obtained using a 1.5 T Siemens Sonata scanner with a T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence. The key parameters included: repetition time (TR) of 2 seconds, echo time (TE) of 39 milliseconds, field of view set at 224 mm, acquisition matrix of 64 \u00d7 64, flip angle of 80 degrees, voxel dimensions of 3.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 3 mm, and a 1 mm gap between slices. A total of 27 slices were acquired in ascending order, with 256 volumes recorded for both the eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions.\nThe fMRI data underwent preprocessing using SPM5 software. Images were realigned and spatially normalized to MNI space, with a voxel size resampled to 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 mm and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 mm).\nA spatial group independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on the fMRI data from all participants for both conditions (eyes-open and eyes-closed). The data for each participant were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA), retaining 120 principal components. Subsequently, the simplified data were decomposed into 100 independent components using the Infomax algorithm. The stability of these components was confirmed through ICASSO analysis, which involved 10 iterations. The independent components (IC) and their corresponding time courses (TC) were reconstructed. Fifty-four ICs were identified as intrinsic connectivity networks (ICN), excluding those associated with physiological noise, motion-related artifacts, or imaging artifacts. The evaluation of these components was based on the expectation that ICNs would exhibit peak activation in gray matter, with minimal spatial overlap with known vascular, ventricular, motion, and susceptibility artifacts, and primarily low-frequency fluctuations (less than 0.1 Hz). Following established protocols, the TCs for the 54 ICs underwent additional post-processing, which included detrending for linear, quadratic, and cubic trends, multiple regression to adjust for six parameters and their temporal derivatives, removal of detected outliers, and bandpass filtering within the range of [0.01-0.10 Hz]. Finally, the ICA time course matrices were extracted for each participant under both conditions (eyes-open and eyes-closed), resulting in a time matrix of dimensions [time: 256 \u00d7 ICN: 54]. All participants in the study were healthy volunteers, right-handed, and had no prior experience with neurofeedback experiments. They provided written informed consent before taking part in the study. Following a specialized calibration session, each participant underwent three neurofeedback motor imagery sessions, each lasting 320 seconds. Each session consisted of eight blocks that alternated between 20 seconds of rest, with eyes open, and 20 seconds of motor imagery for the right hand. Neurofeedback data from thirteen participants were displayed as one-dimensional (1D) in Figure 2 (left), while data from twelve participants were shown as two-dimensional (2D) in Figure 2 (middle). In both scenarios, the goal was to guide a ball into a deep blue area."}, {"title": "F. EEG-fMRI brain map was constructed", "content": "The correlation matrix R is formed by utilizing elements that represent Pearson correlation coefficients (rij ). These coefficients are derived from the spectral time series of 30 EEG electrodes and the time series from 54 fMRI independent components (ICs). This procedure is conducted for five EEG frequency bands across two conditions (Eyes Open (EO) and Eyes Closed (EC)). To analyze the relationship between EEG and fMRI signals, the EEG power time series undergoes convolution with a standard hemodynamic response function (HRF) to account for the latency in hemodynamic responses, as supported by earlier studies.\nThe undirected static connectivity graph for EEG-fMRI is constructed from each N\u00d7N correlation matrix R (where N=84 in this study, comprising 30 EEG electrodes and 54 fMRI brain components). This graph includes negative correlations, as well as weighted positive (W+) and negative (W-) connections. In the positive connection graph, negative correlation values in RRR are replaced by zero, while the positive correlation values remain unchanged. Conversely, in the negative connection graph, positive correlations are set to zero, and the absolute values of negative correlations in R are maintained.\n$W_{ij}^{+} = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } r_{ij} \\leq 0 \\\\ r_{ij} & \\text{if } r_{ij} < 0 \\end{cases}$\n$W_{ij}^{-} = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } r_{ij} \\geq 0 \\\\ |r_{ij}| & \\text{if } r_{ij} \\geq 0 \\end{cases}$\nDynamic EEG-fMRI graph analysis involves the calculation of correlation matrices (256 \u00d7 84; width L=20 TRs, with a step size of 1 TR) using a continuous sliding window across the matrix EFEFEF. The first 30 columns represent the EEG electrodes, while the next 54 columns correspond to the fMRI independent components (ICs). This method results in 237 EEG-fMRI correlation matrices (237 = 256 \u2212 20 + 1) calculated from 237 windows. As in the static analysis, both positive and negative connection graphs are examined separately. The framework for constructing static and dynamic concurrent EEG-fMRI multimodal brain maps is depicted in Figure 3.\nWe utilized a window width of 20 TRs (40 seconds) based on research indicating that cognitive states can be accurately identified with data from short periods of 30 to 60 seconds. Studies have shown that non-stationary fluctuations in functional connectivity can be detected with a 40-second window. Variations in brain connectivity are not particularly sensitive to specific window lengths in the range of 10-20 TRs (20-40 seconds). Our previous work has demonstrated that shorter time windows reduce the number of statistically significant correlations in brain connectivity and increase variability. A sliding window size of approximately 22 TRs (44 seconds) strikes a good balance between resolving dynamics and the quality of connectivity estimates.\nWe employed three key metrics-connection strength (CS), clustering coefficient (CC), and global efficiency (GE) to assess brain network functionality. The Brain Connectivity Toolbox was used to extract global and node-level values for both static and dynamic graphs. We computed the variance of dynamic metrics across 237 time windows and low-frequency (0-0.025 Hz) fluctuation amplitudes. For statistical analysis, a 5 (frequency bands) \u00d7 2 (eye conditions) repeated measures ANOVA and paired t-tests were conducted on the static and dynamic measurements."}, {"title": "G.

Detect connection status", "content": "Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging has shown that fluctuations in time-varying functional brain connectivity lead to distinct, well-organized patterns, known as connectivity states, which can appear or disappear over time. In this study, we apply a previously developed method to identify the connectivity states of dynamic EEG-fMRI graphs for each individual.\nInitially, we compute the node-level connectivity strength for each time-varying EEG-fMRI graph. To evaluate how EEG-fMRI network patterns are related across different time windows, we create a new correlation matrix based on the connectivity strengths between nodes across all time windows. This involves examining each pair of time windows across the 84 nodes.\nModular community structure is a prevalent characteristic of complex networks. Modularity assesses the quality of grouping nodes into communities, where the modules in the correlation matrix correspond to groups of time windows displaying similar brain connectivity patterns. We analyze the modular organization of this correlation matrix using a modularity algorithm. The number of modules reflects the different connectivity states present within the dynamic EEG-fMRI graphs. Lastly, we average the EEG-fMRI brain graphs belonging to the same module to derive the graph representing that connectivity state."}, {"title": "III.

It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost of living and quality of life in\nmajor economies.

In this\nstudy, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of life through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various\nsocio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our index utilises economic indicators that define living\nstandards, which could help in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine learning framework for\naddressing the problem of missing data for some of the economic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update\nthe data and use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to create the Ease of Living Index for major\neconomies since 1970. Our work significantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for policymakers to identify areas\nneeding improvement, such as healthcare systems, employment opportunities, and public safety. Our approach with open data\nand code can be easily reproduced and applied to various contexts.

Introduction", "content": "The assessment of the quality of life has evolved significantly\nover the years, incorporating a wide range of socioeconomic\nand infrastructural factors [1]. Quantitative indexes, such as the\nWorld Happiness Index, rank countries based on various qual-\nity of life factors [2]. Measuring happiness and quality of life\nis complex, current methods for assessing happiness might not\nbe directly comparable, thus questioning the validity of averag-\ning happiness and quality of life [3]. Existing indices are often\nhighly biased towards economic factors such as Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP) per capita with a direct link to the overall quality\nof life [4]. The Human Development Index, World Happiness\nIndex [5] and Global Competitive Index [6] use the GDP per\ncapita as a key indicator of national well-being, employment\nand economic prosperity.\nRecently, there has been a lot of criticism towards existing\nindexes for their biases towards subjective measures. Research\nhas shown that variables such as GDP per capita can signifi-\ncantly and negatively impact the happiness index [7], and qual-\nity of life index [8], suggesting that economic metrics heavily\ninfluence reported happiness levels [9]. Factors such as leisure,\ninequality, mortality, morbidity, crime, and the natural environ-\nment play significant roles in determining living standards but\nare not adequately reflected in GDP measurements [10]. In ad-\ndition to these challenges, the multidimensional nature of well-\nbeing [11] necessitates a more comprehensive approach. Pre-\nvious studies have often isolated economic factors, neglecting\nthe interplay between socio-economic conditions and infras-\ntructural elements. This oversight limits the understanding of\nhow diverse factors collectively influence living standards [12].\nSeveral major indexes for ranking countries in the domain\nof quality of life and ease of living exist, but they have ma-\njor limitations. The Global Livability Index [13] primarily fo-\ncuses on stability, healthcare, culture, and environment, but it\nfrequently lacks detailed data on social cohesion and commu-\nnity engagement, which are vital for understanding the qual-\nity of life in urban areas. Moreover, the Quality of Life Index\n[14], while encompassing various dimensions of urban living,\noften relies on aggregated data that may not reflect local reali-\nties. This is particularly evident in regions where data collection\nmechanisms are underdeveloped, leading to significant gaps in\ninformation on critical aspects such as public safety [15], envi-\nronmental sustainability [16], and economic inclusiveness.\nThe World Happiness Report [17] utilises data from surveys\nthat ask people to respondents to evaluate their current lives on\na scale, often referred to as the \"happiness ladder\". A notable\nflaw in this index is its reliance on self-reported data, which can\nbe influenced by cultural biases and social desirability, leading\nto discrepancies between reported happiness and actual well-\nbeing [18]. The Happiness Index developed by the Happiness\nAlliance employs a comprehensive survey instrument that as-\nsesses multiple dimensions of well-being, yet it does not ex-\nplicitly address how each dimension is weighted in the overall\nindex calculation[19]. This lack of clarity can lead to criticisms\nregarding the transparency and validity of the index. Another"}, {"title": "2.

Traditional imputation methods often\nstruggle with the complexities and dependencies inherent in\nsuch data [32]. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Net-\nworks (GANs) [45] have gained prominence due to their abil-\nity to model complex data distributions. An implementation of\nGAN, the Generative Adversarial Imputation Network (GAIN)\nhas been shown to outperform conventional methods by effec-\ntively capturing the underlying data structure and generating\nplausible imputations for missing values in various datasets, in-\ncluding clinical and environmental data[46, 47]. Recent devel-\nopments in deep learning have introduced models such as Bidi-\nrectional Recurrent Imputation for Time Series (BRITS) [48],\nwhich specifically address the temporal dependencies in time\nseries data. BRITS employ a recurrent neural network (RNNs)\n[49] architecture to handle multiple correlated missing values\nand adaptively update imputed values.\nIn addition to GANs, other machine learning models have\nalso been explored for imputation tasks.

Background on Related Indexes", "content": "A number of researchers rank quality of life based on com-\npensating differentials in labour, housing, and consumption\nmarkets.

These amenities are attractive features\nof locations, such as sunny, smog-free days, safety from vio-\nlent crime, and well-staffed, effective schools. This index as-\nsesses the monetary value of the set of amenities that house-\nholds gain by living and working in a particular area [69]. In\nthis respect, observation can be drawn about consumers' loca-\ntional choices based on their evaluation of an area's amenities,\nwhich ultimately determine their overall well-being.

This index\nhas gained prominence as a tool for understanding the factors\nthat contribute to happiness on a global scale, transcending tra-\nditional economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP). The WHI is based on survey data that captures individ-\nuals' perceptions of their lives, encompassing various dimen-\nsions such as emotional well-being, social support, and eco-\nnomic stability. The WHI employs five key indicators including\nlife ladders, social support, freedom to make life choices, gen-\nerosity, and perceptions of corruption to create a comprehen-\nsive picture of happiness across different countries. In addition\nto these primary indicators, the WHI also considers macroeco-\nnomic factors such as GDP per capita, which can provide con-\ntext for understanding happiness levels. Over the years, there\nhas been a significant backlash in the media about the biases\nin data collection for this index, which seem to penalise devel-\noping countries based on their GDP [72] and cultural measure-\nment bias [73]. For instance, a war-hit country such as Ukraine\nwas ranked to be happier than India in 2023 [74].

It is used primarily in the context of income, wealth,\nor consumption inequality within a population or social group.\nThis measure was introduced by the Italian statistician and so-\nciologist Corrado Gini [82] to quantify inequality by analysing\nthe distribution of variables, such as income levels. A Gini co-\nefficient of O indicates complete equality, where all individuals\nhave identical income or wealth, whereas a coefficient of 1 (or\n100%) signifies extreme inequality, where one individual pos-\nsesses all the income or wealth, and the rest have none. This\nmetric is instrumental in understanding the degree of inequal-\nity within a given group or nation[83].

{"title": "Towards an Ontology of Traceable Impact Management in the Food Supply Chain", "authors": ["Bart Gajderowicz", "Mark S Fox", "Yongchao Gao"], "abstract": "The pursuit of quality improvements and accountability in the food supply chains, especially\nhow they relate to food-related outcomes, such as hunger, has become increasingly vital,\nnecessitating a comprehensive approach that encompasses product quality and its impact\non various stakeholders and their communities. Such an approach offers numerous benefits\nin increasing product quality and eliminating superfluous measurements while appraising\nand alleviating the broader societal and environmental repercussions. A traceable impact\nmanagement model (TIMM) provides an impact structure and a reporting mechanism that\nidentifies each stakeholder's role in the total impact of food production and consumption\nstages.\n\nThe model aims to increase traceability's utility in understanding the impact of changes on\ncommunities affected by food production and consumption, aligning with current and future\ngovernment requirements, and addressing the needs of communities and consumers. This\nholistic approach is further supported by an ontological model that forms the logical\nfoundation and a unified terminology. By proposing a holistic and integrated solution across\nmultiple stakeholders, the model emphasizes quality and the extensive impact of\nchampioning accountability, sustainability, and responsible practices with global traceability.\n\nWith these combined efforts, the food supply chain moves toward a global tracking and\ntracing process that not only ensures product quality but also addresses its impact on a\nbroader scale, fostering accountability, sustainability, and responsible food production and\nconsumption.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "United Nations Sustainability Goal (UNSDG) number 2, \u201cZero Hunger\u201d, shifts the focus from\nquality and performance metrics of food production to understanding how food supply\nchains impact stakeholders who suffer from hunger and food insecurity. \u201cFood security\nrequires a multi-dimensional approach - from social protection to safeguard safe and\nnutritious food, especially for children, to transforming food systems to achieve a more\ninclusive and sustainable world. There will need to be investments in rural and urban areas\nand in social protection so poor people have access to food and can improve their\nlivelihoods.\"\u00b9 This shift in focus necessitates a-comprehensive understanding of key\nstakeholders, such as the poor, those living in remote areas or where access to food is\nlimited, as well as organizations that fund and operationalize food production and\ndistribution on these consumer stakeholders. It also focuses on the impact the supply chain\nhas on their desired outcomes, whether not being hungry, eating notional food, and\ndelivering food that is of high quality, safe to consume, in a secure manner that abides by\ndifferent jurisdictions the food may go through. It requires the ability to trace how activities\nand events in the supply chain affect stakeholder outcomes.\n\nThe pursuit of traceable impact within the agricultural food chain is a multifaceted\nendeavour, as outlined by Pizzuti and Mirabelli (2003). It seeks to establish a global standard\nfor impact tracking and tracing processes. This initiative begins with a thorough analysis of\nthe food supply chain, dissecting the intricate web of production, processing, distribution,\nand consumption. Building upon this analysis, it extends into the realm of supply chain\nmodelling, laying out the structural and operational dynamics that govern the flow of food\nproducts. Integral to this pursuit is the development of an impact management model,\nwhich aims to determine the effects of the food supply chain on both socio-economic and\nenvironmental fronts. Underpinning these models is the critical role of data collection and\ndata modelling, which provide the empirical basis for understanding and improving the\nsupply chain. Finally, the process culminates in creating software tools designed to enhance\nfood chain processes, fostering positive impacts and mitigating risks. This comprehensive\napproach addresses the complexities of the global food system and sets a trajectory for\nsustainable and responsible food production and distribution.\n\nThis paper proposes an ontology-based modelling and analysis framework that integrates\nimpact management and traceability within the food supply chain. In the next section, we\ndiscuss traceability in the Supply Chain. We then introduce the concept of Traceable Impact\nManagement. We review the areas of Impact Management, Traceability in the supply chain\nand the benefits of combining the two. We next define the Traceable Impact Management\nontology, which combines and extends the ISO/IEC 5087-1 smart city standard and the\nCommon Impact Data Standard (CIDS), that form the foundation of our framework."}, {"title": "Traceability in the Supply Chain", "content": "Traceability, as it pertains to the food supply chain, is the ability to track each step of the\nfood production, processing, transportation and consumption processes and the ability to\nretrace each tracked step from one point to its origins (Olsen & Borit, 2013); Mc Carthy et\nal., 2018). It entails knowing the atomic events that transform food products from raw\nmaterials into packaged goods, the consumption of food products, as well as the by-\nproducts and waste each activity produces. Traceability also entails the who dimension,\ntracking the role of each stakeholder and the activities they perform in transforming the\nproducts through production, processing and consumption. The tracked steps should have a\ntemporal dimension, capturing when and for how long that activities or events occurred.\nTraceability should have a geospatial component, capturing where the tracked events\noccurred. The tracked steps also should include the quantity dimension, knowing what and\nhow much of it was produced, etc. Finally, traceability should capture the quality of products\nto trace and identify the origins of issues in the supply chain.\nThere are four pillars of food security, namely availability, access, utilization, and stability\n(McCarthy et al., 2018). Consider the supply chain through which beef moves from\nproduction to consumption, as illustrated in Figure 1. The linear nature of this process hides\nthe complexities required to achieve accountability, sustainability, and traceability and the\nrole they play in food insecurity.\n\nDuring beef production, raising cattle is susceptible to many factors, including the\nenvironment, viruses, and the availability of quality feed and medicines (Roberts et al.,\n2004). During environmental issues, such as drought or disease, beef production will slow\ndown at best. At worst, it may contaminate other parts of the supply chain or even reach the\nmarket. Next, beef is processed by combining ingredients and other materials to produce\nproducts like packaged beef patties ready for distribution. The transfer and storage of raw\nbeef are susceptible to many airborne contaminants and temperature fluctuations,\nincreasing the opportunity for contamination and spoilage. The equipment transforming\ncattle into beef and packaged patties requires resources, raw materials, and personnel to\noperate and maintain. The personnel working at the facilities are reliant on the region where\nthey live, such as housing, health care, education, and other social services. Any outbreaks\nof disease among the personnel or any issues in their lives that impact their productivity will\nslow down production or affect quality.\n\nThe distribution network has a broader point of contact and is multi-spatial. For example,\nstoring and transporting beef requires many points of transferring the product from one\norganization to another, often crossing regions with different food handling policies and\njurisdictions. Political and regulatory factors may contribute to food insecurity. Food may not\nbe delivered where regulations have higher standards. Policy or social demands may cause\nfood to be processed differently than expected. Wrong or incompatible definitions of food\nbetween stakeholders or across borders make it difficult to track food transformation\nconsistently. Economic factors, such as currency fluctuation, may impact food delivery to\nregions where lower profits are due to lower prices or remote areas where delivery costs are\nhigher (Carney, 2011).\n\nFinally, many compounding factors of food insecurity can only be detected at the final point\nof delivery when selling or consuming food (Hoek et al., 2021). Prematurely expired meat\ndue to long deliveries or broken-down refrigeration units makes the food inedible. Wrong or\ncontaminated ingredients may cause food to lose its nutritional value."}, {"title": "Tracing Impact", "content": "Figure 2 illustrates how food insecurity factors impacting the consumer (nutrition and\naffordability) are propagated to the producer. To achieve accountability, we must begin at\nthe start of the food supply chain, where the raw materials are produced, and continue\nthrough to the final stage of consumption. To achieve sustainability, we must have a complex\nand interconnected network of stakeholders. Hence, rather than relying on linear processes,\nsustainability is achieved through the availability of different paths goods can travel through.\nFinally, to achieve holistic traceability, we must ensure that every point in the path is\naccounted for.\n\nTraceability within the supply chain forms the basis for efficient recall procedures,\nminimizing losses in case of quality concerns. Moreover, it provides valuable information\nabout raw materials, facilitating better quality and process control while eliminating\nredundant measurements in successive steps. It fosters an incentive to maintain the\ninherent quality of raw materials. It aligns with governmental requirements, such as\nconfirming the country of origin and each step of the food production process, production,\npackaging, transfer, storage, and sale. Furthermore, traceability systems help eliminate\nredundant measurements and inspections by ensuring that information gathered at one\nstage of the supply chain is accurately relayed and utilized downstream, enhancing overall\nefficiency."}, {"title": "Sectors", "content": "Four key economic sectors make up the food supply chain and its stakeholders, as illustrated\nin Figure 3, namely:\n\u2022 Agriculture produces and processes raw materials, distinguished into segments like\ncrop cultivation processes, aquaculture, livestock or poultry production processes.\n\u2022 Agro-industries include a variety of processes for processing, combining, packaging\nand testing food products.\n\u2022 Trade/Distribution sectors perform activities such as buying, transporting,\nwarehousing and selling food products.\n\u2022 Industries are auxiliary to the other three sectors by providing technical equipment\nand supplies.\n\nTo successfully create a traceable impact model, we must identify all stakeholders within\nthese sectors. Such stakeholders may include food producers, processors, logistics\ncompanies, commercial organizations, and customers. They may include consolidators such\nas those that buy bundles or in bulk for resale.\n\nFood Supply Chain Modeling employs a variety of methodologies to develop a trace graph,\nwhich is essential for visualizing and optimizing the flow of goods from producers to\nconsumers. Among the methodologies utilized are Petri-nets (Balamurugan et al., 2021),\nwhich offer a mathematical modelling language ideal for describing distributed systems; and\nIntegration Definition (IDEF) (Thakur et al., 2009), a family of modelling languages in the field\nof systems and software engineering. Event-Driven Process Chains (EPC) (Bevilacqua et al.,\n2009) also play a crucial role in depicting business process workflows, providing clarity on\nevent sequences and organizational functions. Furthermore, modelling approaches such as\nUML activity diagrams (Islam at el., 2021) and Business Process Modeling (BPM) (Gayialis,\n2022; Pizzutti, 2012) has significantly advanced these efforts, with various initiatives and\nnotations emerging to standardize and improve the representation and analysis of business\nprocesses within the food supply chain, thereby enhancing traceability and efficiency.\nAdditional methods have been identified as having the potential to model a traceable food\nsupply chain (Pizzuti, 2015; Verdouw, 2010), including Structured Analysis and Design\nTechnique (SADT), which focuses on the systematic analysis of information flow; Electronic\nDocument Management (EDOC) for Business Processes, and Activity Decision Flow (ADF)\ncontribute detailed perspectives on operational activities and decision-making processes."}, {"title": "In modelling the food supply chain", "content": "In modelling the food supply chain, it is important to distinguish between what is planned\nversus what has happened. The former requires specifying the network of activities,\nresources, stakeholders, goals, etc., while the latter extends it by capturing events that occur\nacross the supply chain, necessitating the collection of data throughout. Data collection\nencompasses a wide array of traceable elements crucial for maintaining transparency and\nensuring accountability throughout the chain. Traceable data include detailed records of the\nprimary stakeholders producing and distributing food products. This data encapsulates the\nresponsibilities and liabilities associated with the product and its origin. Additionally, data\nregarding the product are collected, including information on the product's state, the\nmachinery and utensils used in its production, and any food additives, feed, or fertilizers\nemployed in the process. Just as important, it requires data about the product as it moves\nthrough the supply chain. For example, the transportation of meat requires capturing\nproduct temperatures over time. Central to tracing is product identification, which is\nachieved through unique identifiers, such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near\nField Communication (NFC) technologies, and the reuse of existing standards such as GS1\nand EPC.\n\nTraceability within the food supply chain can be conceptualized at various levels of\nabstraction. Internal or local traceability refers to the detailed monitoring within an\norganization's own system. It includes meticulous tracking of product identification,\nresources such as feed, seeds, and herbicides, along with packaging material and\nequipment. Furthermore, it records storage management and processing times, providing a\ncomprehensive view of the product's journey within a single entity's domain. This level of\ntraceability is instrumental in ensuring the integrity of products and processes within a\nparticular actor's scope of the supply chain.\n\nConversely, global traceability provides a macroscopic view of the product's journey across\ndifferent stakeholders in the system. This level of traceability focuses on less granular but\nequally essential data points such as arrival time, transport duration, the origin of the\nproduct, and, particularly in the case of meat products, the identification of the animal or\ngroup from which the meat was sourced. Such information is vital for broader oversight and\ncoordination among various supply chain actors, enabling tracking products across different\nstages and entities, from farm to table."}, {"title": "Traceable Impact Management", "content": "Impact \"refers to the intended and unintended (positive or otherwise) changes (outputs,\noutcomes) that occur across the organization (within and/or across its programs) and with its\nstakeholders (including users, clients, partners, etc.) over a period of time (short term, long\nterm) as a result of the organization's activities\u201d2 Numerous impact models, such as the\nLogic Model, Theory of Change, Outcome Map, Outcome Chain, and Impact Map, offer\nvarious lenses through which impact can be articulated and measured.

This\nincludes the dimensions of What, Who, How Much, Contribution, and Risk, which together\nprovide a comprehensive framework for understanding the changes brought about by social\npurpose organizations.\n\nThe five dimensions were extended with the development of the Common Impact Data\nStandard (CIDS) (Table 1) where the introduction of the \u201cHow\u201d dimension defines the steps\nfor achieving outcomes (Fox and Ruff, 2021).

This framework applies to all types of organizations, not\nonly those with a social purpose, by providing a structured approach to documenting and\nevaluating the impact of their activities.\n\nImpact Management in the food supply chain entails establishing and subsequent\nmonitoring of an Impact Model specific to the food supply chain. This model requires\ncomprehensive definitions for key concepts (Fox and Ruff, 2021), including:\n\u2022 outcomes (e.g., intended and unintended changes due to the food supply chain's\nproduction and consumption phases),\n\u2022 stakeholders (e.g., those expressing a desire for or inadvertently feeling the impact of\noutcomes), and\n\u2022 indicators (used to measure and report on the impact of the supply chain on\nstakeholder outcomes.\nTraceable impact management links stakeholder outcomes to traceable resources, activities\nand events in the supply chain.

A\ntime-point, signifying an atomic instance, exists\nwithin a broader interval called a time-interval. A\ntime-interval is demarcated by boundary time-points\nthat encapsulate the duration of an activity, defined\nby its start and end time-points. The concept of a\ntime window further refines this by establishing the\nearliest and latest thresholds for the start and end of\nan activity, introducing flexibility and constraints\nwithin temporal planning. Finally, time interval\nrelations (Figure 7) articulate the sequential or\noverlapping nature of intervals.

Together,\nthey convey how much of a resource is available at some point in time at some location.\nSecondly, it captures the allocation, past, present and future, to activities that either use or\nconsume it. Finally, it captures contextual properties, such as whether a resource can be\nsubdivided and still useable by an activity. The properties are important for tasks such as\nresource scheduling, allocation, and traceability. For example, knowing what processes and\nresources were involved in creating a beef patty package (ground beef and spices) allows for\nthe traceability of resources used to make that package. In this way, we can track each\nprocess and the impact the consumption of resources has on the creation of each resource.\nApplication types are analysed to understand if and how an activity uses and releases a\nresource or whether the resource is depleted, which in turn influences replenishment cycles\nand cost implications. Divisibility plays a key role in determining a resource's utility, dictating\nwhether it can be allocated partly to concurrent activities without losing functionality. For\nexample, a batch of ground beef can be split into multiple beef patty packages, but a single\npatty box cannot be divided, instead being consumed (i.e., bought/sold) in its entirety.\nResources are not limited to the raw materials used to create food products. For example,\nthe machinery, energy, and human capital used to transform raw beef into beef patties must\nbe tracked, and their impact must be evaluated. For example, machines use energy, which\nimpacts the environment. Human capital is used, which has a positive impact on the local\ncommunity through employment, tax income, and so on.\n\nTo act on traceable impact metrics, utilizing resources to be shared among various activities\nis fundamental to optimizing its use across a system. For example, the utilization of human\ncapital to process meats impacts local communities from which the workers are from.\nTransferring beef patties impacts the local environment through which it is transported,\ntaking up roads and railways while refuelling at gas stations. The selling and consumption of\nbeef patties have an economic and health-related impact on the communities where\nconsumers live. Spatial considerations are addressed by the resource's location, which\nimpacts logistics, accessibility, and response times. Lastly, the commitment of a resource to\nactivities at a specific time encapsulates its planned utilization, reflecting its role and\nimportance within the operational framework.

Predicated on the notion that quality equates to \"conformance to requirements,\"\nthe ontology divides the domain of quality into the distinct sub-domains of measurement,\nanalysis, identification, and traceability. The Identification Ontology allows for unique\nidentification and classification of entities, ensuring that the quality of one can be\ndistinguished and compared to another. The Traceability Ontology enables the\ndetermination of all pertinent entities and their attributes that influence the quality of a\nspecified entity within an enterprise can be traced and identified. This approach establishes\na foundational capability for traceability to analyze and address quality-related issues.\nThe traceability ontology defines a Traceable Resource Unit (TRU) (Figure 9) as a\nhomogeneous collection of resources categorized by a class and quantified by its interaction\nwith a primitive activity (Kim et al, 1995). A TRU identifies the state of a resource at a given\npoint in time and location, hence a TRU's existence is recognized at the point of the\nresource's first use, consumption, production, or release, with its quantity determined and\nfixed at that initial time-point and location. For example, Figure 9 illustrates a TRU for the\nproduction of the beef patty resource (\u201cproduce ground beef\u201d) along with its time point (To),\nvalue, quantity and units of measure (200 lbs), and its location in the meat packing plant\n(\"Plant, Guelph, ON\u201d). Quantitative changes to a TRU are recorded at specific state\nchanges-such as post-production or release\u2014and remain unchanged in the absence of a\nnew transaction. A TRU has no measured quantity before its inception but maintains a\nmeasurable quantity, including zero if consumed, after that. This ontology disallows the post-\nrecognition incrementation of a TRU's quantity and asserts that individual units within a TRU\nare indistinguishable, precluding traceability within a single TRU. Furthermore, suppose a\nTRU's consumption requires more resources than is available. In that case, it necessitates\ndrawing from additional TRUs, with the consequence that aggregating multiple TRUs does\nnot preserve the identity of any singular TRU."}, {"title": "Common Impact Data Standard", "content": "The Common Impact Data Standard (CIDS), depicted in Figure 11, is a data standard for\ndefining and measuring the impact of activities (Fox and Ruff, 2021).

It transports beef from \u201cTruck, Guelph, Ontario\u201d to its final destination, namely \"Truck,\nMontreal, Quebec.\u201d The \u201cTrucked Beef\u201d :UseState :tru transition's the beef's state from\n\"Produced Beef\u201d to \u201cTrucked Beef\" since it uses the resource beef without consuming any of\nit, creating a new :tru at time-point T\u2081. Given that the transport's destination is within 1000\nkm, it also satisfies the claim that the beef is locally produced, and the \u201cLocallyProduced\"\nindicator has a value of \"True.\"\n\nFigure 18 illustrates the next step in the supply chain, namely the delivery of the beef to the\ngrocery store 644 km from the meat packer. At time point T2, the grocery store organization\n\"Joe's Supermarket\u201d receives the beef and stocks it in their store. \u201cJoe's Supermarket\u201d is an\ninstance of both the :GroceyStore class and :Organization class. It performs the activity of\n\"Stock Beef\", creating the :ProduceState :tru at T2 with 200 lbs of beef. Again, since the\nlocation of the \u201cStocked Beef", "LocallyProduced": "ndicator's value is \u201cTrue\u201d at time-point T2.\n\nThe final step in the supply chain is the selling of beef to consumers. Figure 19 illustrates this\nby tracing the buying of 2 lbs of beef by a consumer at time point T4. The consumer \u201cJoe\u201d"}, {"the": "Consumer class as well as a member of the CIDS class\n:BeneficialStakeholder that identifies a group of stakeholders that benefit from resources in\nthe supply chain.

This activity transitions a portion of the 200 lbs of beef", "Bought Beef,": "reating a :ConsumeState :tru at time point T4 for 2lbs of\\"}]}

Brunton", "Christian Lagemann"], "abstract": "The accurate quantification of wall-shear stress dynamics is of substantial importance for various applications in fundamental and applied research, spanning areas from human health to aircraft design and optimization. Despite significant progress in experimental measurement techniques and post-processing algorithms, temporally resolved wall-shear stress dynamics with adequate spatial resolution and within a suitable spatial domain remain an elusive goal. Furthermore, there is a systematic lack of universal models that can accurately replicate the instantaneous wall-shear stress dynamics in numerical simulations of multi-scale systems where direct numerical simulations are prohibitively expensive. To address these gaps, we introduce a deep learning architecture that ingests wall-parallel velocity fields from the logarithmic layer of turbulent wall-bounded flows and outputs the corresponding 2D wall-shear stress fields with identical spatial resolution and domain size. From a physical perspective, our framework acts as a surrogate model encapsulating the various mechanisms through which highly energetic outer-layer flow structures influence the governing wall-shear stress dynamics. The network is trained in a supervised fashion on a unified dataset comprising direct numerical simulations of statistically 1D turbulent channel and spatially developing turbulent boundary layer flows at friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 390 to 1,500. We demonstrate a zero-shot applicability to experimental velocity fields obtained from Particle-Image Velocimetry measurements and verify the physical accuracy of the wall-shear stress estimates with synchronized wall-shear stress measurements using the Micro-Pillar Shear-Stress Sensor for Reynolds numbers up to 2,000. In summary, the presented framework lays the groundwork for extracting inaccessible experimental wall-shear stress information from readily available velocity measurements and thus, facilitates advancements in a variety of experimental applications.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Turbulent wall-bounded fluid flows are of significant importance for numerous engineering [26, 28, 34, 38, 49] and biomedical applications [1, 7, 56, 61], e.g., in the context of reducing the CO2 emissions in the transportation sector or enhancing disease prevention and monitoring in human medicine. However, due to their high-dimensional, non-linear, and unsteady dynamics, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of these flows. One particular quantity of interest is the wall-shear stress since it is a measure of the friction forces and the flow-induced dynamic loads acting on the surface. However, measuring the wall-shear stress in experimental settings is still a significant - often even an unfeasible - challenge [27, 44]. Therefore, the present work introduces a modern deep learning based algorithm to predict the wall-shear stress distribution based on accessible velocity measurements, which are usually obtained from Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments [47, 52]. Recent advances in PIV image processing [23, 24, 25] have demonstrated how a deep optical flow network can be used to derive highly accurate wall-shear stress dynamics from PIV measurements in the wall-normal plane in which the viscous sublayer is well resolved [27]. However, such an approach requires proper experimental conditions with a sufficiently high spatial resolution, which can be challenging especially for high Reynolds number flows and in the presence of experimental burdens like optical access or reflections at the wall. Therefore, a well-designed model capable of predicting the time-dependent dynamics of the spatial wall-shear stress distribution solely based on readily available wall-parallel measurement data at a certain distance from the wall is of tremendous value. The foundation for the success of such a model is rooted in a vast literature [2, 5, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, 45] showing that the dominant dynamics of the inner layer of a turbulent wall-bounded flow and consequently, of the wall-shear stress, are imposed by highly energetic outer-layer flow structures located in the logarithmic region. Thus, based on this inner-outer interaction, it can be hypothesized that outer-layer velocity fields contain sufficient information to derive the governing wall-shear stress dynamics. Moreover, recent advances in machine learning are revolutionizing how we approach the challenging analysis of complex fluid dynamical systems characterized by high-dimensionality, non-linearity, and multi-scale features [8, 10, 11, 21, 29, 48, 59, 60], establishing a promising foundation for their applicability in the present work. Precisely, we developed a deep neural operator network specifically designed to learn a mapping function from 2D wall-parallel velocity fields located in the outer layer of turbulent wall-bounded flows to the instantaneous and spatially resolved wall-shear stress distribution. Trained on direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of turbulent channel and turbulent boundary layer flows at friction Reynolds numbers ranging from $Rer \\approx 390$ to 1,500, the generalization of our framework is evidenced with an experimental setup using simultaneous PIV measurements in the outer layer and wall-shear stress measurements with the Micro-Pillar Shear-Stress Sensor (MPS3) [16, 19, 20, 31, 40, 43] at friction Reynolds numbers up to $Rer \\approx 2,000$.\nThe idea of using a neural architecture to predict the wall-shear stress was explored in a few former studies [6, 17, 54, 55]. In a medical context, the first attempt to predict the wall-shear stress in a stenosed coronary artery using machine learning was proposed by Su et al. [54]. Based on the geometry of synthetic coronary artery models, a convolutional autoencoder estimates the wall-shear stress distribution. A subsequent study extended this framework to 3D geometries [55]. Going beyond purely geometric input data, Gharleghi et al. [17] invoke a steady state solution of the cardiac flow field to predict the wall-shear stress in bifurcations using convolutional neural networks. However, approaches solely based on geometric features and a time-averaged flow field are unlikely to succeed in predicting instantaneous wall-shear stress information as required for more detailed hemodynamics analyses. Therefore, an emerging research direction in medical science focuses on deriving wall-shear stress data from 4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with machine learning [12, 15]. However, the coarse spatial resolution of state-of-the-art cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data is a significant burden for deriving highly resolved wall-shear stress dynamics [4, 53]."}, {"title": "2 Numerical and experimental datasets", "content": "Three direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets are used in the present study, namely a fully developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) at a friction Reynolds number of $Ret = u_\\tau h/\\nu \\approx 1,000$ (section 2.1) and turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flows at $Ret = u_\\tau \\delta/\\nu \\approx 390$ and $Rer \\approx 1,500$ (section 2.2), where $u_\\tau$ denotes the friction velocity, $h$ the channel half height, $\\delta$ the boundary layer thickness, and $\\nu$ the kinematic viscosity.

Thus, these flow structures are expected to have the most significant impact on the wall-shear stress dynamics. For the numerical datasets, corresponding wall-shear stress fields are extracted at the same spatial location and with the same spatial resolution.

The experimental datasets are used to validate the performance of the deep learning framework with respect to measurement data. Thus, the measurements were targeted to capture the same flow conditions as the numerical datasets, however, small deviations in the experimental settings are unavoidable. Furthermore, two additional configurations are considered to test the performance with an intermediate ($Rer \\approx 610$) and an extrapolated ($Rer \\approx 2,025$) dataset. All relevant experimental measures are summarized in table 1.\nThe experimental setup is sketched in figure 2 and is similar to the setup introduced in [40]. Stereoscopic PIV measurements in a wall-parallel plane at $y^+ \\approx 3.9\\sqrt{Rez}$ are synchronized with wall-shear stress measurements using the Micro-Pillar Shear-Stress Sensor (MPS\u00b3) [16, 19, 20, 31, 40, 43]. The sensor consists of flexible, cylindrical structures (\"micro pillars\u201d), which are immersed in the viscous sublayer and bend due to the experienced fluid forces. A preceding calibration relates the micro-pillar deflection to the instantaneous wall-shear stress. Further details on the measurement principle and the data post-processing are described in [40]."}, {"title": "2.4 Comparison between numerical and experimental datasets", "content": "Although the experiments were targeted to resemble the flow conditions of the numerical data, small inaccuracies and uncertainties are unavoidable in experimental settings. Therefore, we briefly highlight the most significant differences between both datasets for the TCFs at $Ret \\approx 1,000$. This provides a clear foundation for assessing the performance of the neural architecture with respect to the zero-shot applicability to experimental data.\nSince both datasets capture a fully developed TCF, any influence of the inflow conditions is negligible. The experimental facility features an aspect ratio of 20 such that the channel's side walls do not influence the flow along the centerline where the measurements were conducted. Periodic boundary conditions in the DNS exclude side wall effects, too. The friction Reynolds number of the DNS is $Ret \\approx 1,000$, whereas the experimental dataset captures the flow field at $Rez \\approx 970$. Moreover, a small offset of the wall-normal position of the wall-parallel velocity fields exists ($y^+ = 123.38$ in the DNS and $y^+ = 122.09$ in the experiments). However, these differences do not impact the observed flow field characteristics. To investigate the variation within the outer-layer velocity fields in a statistical sense, we apply the 2D Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (2D NA-MEMD) [41] and subsequently perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each mode to inspect the power spectra. In essence, the 2D NA-MEMD decomposes the velocity fields into scale-based modal representations, which are called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), using a data-driven iterative procedure. By simultaneously decomposing the numerical and the experimental data, we ensure that the resulting IMFs capture the same range of scales and reveal similarities as well as differences between numerical and experimental distributions. Thus, we can analyze which range of scales possesses the largest difference, e.g., due to measurement noise or bias. More details regarding the 2D NA-MEMD and its application to fluid flow data can be found in [26, 27, 38, 41]."}, {"title": "3 Deep learning architecture", "content": "The proposed framework is a neural operator network based on a convolutional autoencoder architecture, which is sketched in figure 4. A wall-parallel streamwise velocity fluctuation field of dimensions 128 \u00d7 128 px\u00b2 ($x^+ \\times z^+ \\approx 1,570 \\times 785$) is evaluated the network, which outputs the corresponding wall-shear stress fluctuation field with the same dimension and spatial resolution. The input is first processed by a stem block, which includes a convolution with a kernel size of 7 \u00d7 7 and a stride of 2, followed by a batch normalization, ReLU activation, and max pooling with a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 2. The output of the stem block is a spatially compressed matrix of 32 \u00d7 32 px\u00b2 with 128 feature maps. It is then processed by several basic blocks, which contain a convolution with a kernel size of 3 \u00d7 3, a batch normalization, and ReLU activation. The first basic block of each module (same-sized basic blocks in figure 4 build a module) applies a convolution with a stride of 2 and a doubling of the feature space, whereas the subsequent blocks have a stride of 1 and preserve the feature space dimension. The ReLU activation is omitted at the output of each module. The compressed latent representation has a spatial dimension of 4 \u00d7 4 px\u00b2 with 1024 feature maps. Each module of the decoder contains a preceding interpolation layer, which upsamples the spatial dimension by a factor of 2 using nearest neighbors interpolation. Our studies showed that this type of upsampling in the early stages of decoding improves the resolution of small-scale features compared to the often used transposed convolution. All basic blocks of the decoder have a stride of 1 and the first basic block in each module halves the feature space. In the final stage, the head block performs three transposed convolutions with subsequent ReLU activation except for the final output. The network is trained in a supervised fashion using the L2 norm between the wall-shear stress prediction and the ground truth as the training loss.\nThe exact number of basic blocks contained in each encoding and decoding module is the result of a hyperparameter study. The encoder performs best with four basic blocks in the first two basic modules and two basic blocks in the third module. For the decoding path, we employ four basic blocks in each network stage. Moreover, we studied the impact of using residual layers within each module (ResNet) as well as cross-connections between the encoder and decoder (Unet). By fine-tuning each of these networks with hyperparameter studies, we achieved a similar performance across all architectures. For the sake of readability, we therefore only discuss results related to the basic autoencoding architecture and provide further details and comparisons with respect to the other architectures in the Appendix.\nThe network training is performed on four NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We used a batch size of 7 and a dropout ratio of 0.3 to prevent overfitting. An Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 9.7\u00b710\u20135 and weight decay of 1.7\u00b710-4 was combined with a scheduler that reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.2 when the validation loss is not improving after 10 epochs. In total, training was performed for 500 epochs with a minimum learning rate of 10-10.\nTwo different training setups are used in the present study. First, we solely train the neural network on the TCF data at $Rer \\approx 1,000$ to investigate the capabilities of the network in the optimal setting (i.e. only a single flow condition). Second, we use all three configurations, i.e., the TCF and both TBL flows, to analyze the generalization ability of the network across flow conditions and slightly changing flow problems (statistically 1D vs. statistically developing flow in streamwise direction). For the first scenario, the numerical TCF dataset described in section 2.1 is randomly divided into a training dataset containing 80 % of the snapshots (7,680 samples), a validation dataset comprising 10% of the snapshots (960 samples), and a test dataset with the remaining 10 % (960 samples). While a validation is performed at the end of each epoch, the test dataset is only used after the entire training procedure is terminated. Thus, it serves as a verification for the network performance on unseen in-distribution data samples.\nIn the second scenario, we use data from all three numerical simulations, i.e., the TCF at $Ret \\approx 1,000$ and the TBL flows at $Ret \\approx 390$ and 1,500, with the same percentage distribution between training, validation, and test samples as for the single configuration (80 %, 10 %, 10 %). To avoid any bias during training, the same number of samples is taken from each dataset. Thus, 4, 164 samples randomly selected from each dataset are used for training (12,492 in total) and 516 (1, 548 in total) for validation and testing, respectively."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "In the following, the discussion of the results is split into two main segments.

This neural network is solely trained on DNS data and first exposed to experimental data during testing, i.e., after the training is completed. Figure 8 shows the experimental input, i.e., the PIV based velocity fluctuation field, and the predicted wall-shear stress distribution for arbitrary experimental test samples. In addition, the true wall-shear stress distribution measured by the MPS3 is provided next to an enlarged extract of the predicted wall-shear stress field matching the experimentally measured region. The comparison shows a good agreement between prediction and ground truth indicating that the network is able to generalize well to experimental conditions without being explicitly trained on an experimental dataset. Some of the predictions appear smoother compared to the measured wall-shear stress fields due to small-scale measurement uncertainties in the MPS\u00b3 data.\nTo provide further details on the experimental predictions on a statistical basis, especially with respect to medium-size and large-scale flow structures that are not captured in the MPS\u00b3 data due to the limited field of view, we apply the 2D NA-MEMD with subsequent FFT to the true numerical, the predicted numerical, and the predicted experimental wall-shear stress fields. Please note that the results related to the numerical data are already given in figure 7. They are included in figure 9 for comparison since the statistics of the experimental estimates are expected to match the numerical statistics if the deep learning framework performs as intended. A distinct difference in the power spectra can be observed for the smallest scales, i.e., in IMF1, as well as in the low-wavelength regime of the streamwise spectra of IMF2. The experimental wall-shear stress predictions are not as accurate as the numerical predictions, which results from the small-scale measurement noise inherent to the experimental velocity measurements (see figure 3). The network is not able to adequately process this information since it was not comprised in the training data distribution, which yields a marginal redistribution of the energetic content. However, we have to acknowledge that these deviations are only within a few percent and the confidence intervals of the numerical and experimental spectra show a substantial overlap. Moreover, the predictions of the medium- and large-scale wavelengths are very accurate. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed architecture is able to estimate physically meaningful wall-shear stress distributions from experimental velocity fields although the training was solely performed with DNS data. It is especially worth mentioning that some of the characteristics of the experimental dataset differ from the numerical dataset as discussed in section 2.4, with the small-scale measurement noise being the most significant source of variation. Nevertheless, the deep learning framework is able to provide reliable instantaneous (figure 8) and statistical (figure 9) information about the experimental wall-shear stress."}, {"title": "4.2 Wall-shear stress predictions of the multi-configuration network using turbulent channel and turbulent boundary layer flows at various Reynolds numbers", "content": "In the following, we show that our proposed deep learning architecture predicts reliable wall-shear stress distributions when trained on a comprehensive dataset that unifies flow fields of different configurations.

On the other hand, we present a successful zero-shot application to experimental TCFs at several Reynolds numbers. Besides the three Reynolds numbers covered in the training dataset (two of which were related to spatially developing TBL flows and not to fully developed TCF), the network also performs well on an intermediate and an extrapolated Reynolds number."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "Acquiring experimental wall-shear stress information is of tremendous value for academic and applied research in a variety of disciplines ranging from human medicine to civil aviation. However, experimental measurements of temporally and spatially resolved wall-shear stress dynamics covering a large spatial domain are extraordinarily challenging - often even impossible. In the present work, we provide a deep learning based surrogate model which derives instantaneous wall-shear stress distributions from wall-parallel velocity fields located within the logarithmic region. In many settings, velocity measurements in this region are easily conducted using planar Particle-Image Velocimetry (PIV). Purely trained on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data, our proposed neural architecture outputs reliable wall-shear stress fields from PIV-based velocity fields. We verify the physical significance of these neural predictions with wall-shear stress measurements, which have been synchronized to the PIV measurements, using the Micro-Pillar Shear-Stress Sensor (MPS\u00b3).\nOur study is based on fully developed turbulent channel flows (TCFs) at friction Reynolds numbers in the range of $400 < Ret \\leq 2,000$ as well as spatially developing turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flows at $Ret \\approx 390$ and $Ret \\approx 1,500$. The velocity fields are extracted in a wall-parallel plane located at $y^+ \\approx 3.9\\sqrt{Rer}$ because the large-scale flow features are most energetic in this region. Thus, they have the most significant impact on the wall-shear stress dynamics due to the various physical mechanisms involved in the inner-outer interaction inherent to turbulent wall-bounded flows. Using a supervised training approach based on DNS data, the proposed deep learning architecture learns a neural representation of these interaction phenomena such that it is able to extract physically correct wall-shear stress distributions from the provided velocity fields. We demonstrate the successful performance of this framework when solely trained on a single flow problem, i.e., the TCF at $Rez \\approx 1,000$, as well as a multi-configuration setting in which TCF and TBL flows at several Reynolds numbers are combined. Furthermore, our deep learning framework demonstrates zero-shot applicability to experimental measurement data of TCFs. Specifically, it provides physically accurate wall-shear stress information from PIV-based velocity fields at various Reynolds numbers without being exposed to the particular characteristics of the measurement data during training. Notably, the framework has proven its predictive capabilities even for Reynolds numbers beyond the scope of the training dataset, including one intermediate and one extrapolated flow condition. This behavior underscores the robustness of our deep learning architecture and its ability to provide accurate wall-shear stress estimates without the necessity of training on the exact flow conditions, which represents a substantial leap towards achieving true generalizability in fluid dynamics modeling.\nThe results of this study bear great potential for experimental and numerical fluid dynamics. Being able to use the proposed framework as a surrogate model to obtain experimental wall-shear stress dynamics can advance research in various domains. For example, it allows to experimentally study the efficiency and the involved physical mechanisms of friction drag reduction techniques, which are mainly investigated by numerical methods so far. In this context, it might also be used in experimental feedback control applications where only access to velocity data is available. On the other hand, our framework can advance the experimental in-vitro investigation of cardiovascular diseases, in which the temporal dynamics as well as the spatial distribution of the wall-shear stress play a central role in disease development and progression. With respect to numerical simulations, our workflow could support the development of enhanced or novel wall models for wall-modeled large-eddy simulations since it constitutes a purely data-driven representation of the inner-outer interactions, which could generalize more broadly than state-of-the-art analytical models when trained on a variety of different flow conditions.\nTo enable these prospective advancements, future studies have to focus on the generalization capabilities in a broader setting. So far, we considered two flow problems at various Reynolds numbers, but the physical mechanisms of the inner-outer interactions within TCFs and TBL flows are quite similar. Thus, an extension to a broader range of flow problems with a higher variability in the respective flow conditions is required. Moreover, it is certainly of great interest to understand how the neural network transfers outer-layer velocity to wall-shear stress information. Therefore, the application of symbolic regression [9, 57, 58] to the latent space could provide an analytical expression of the inherent mapping function, which can subsequently be analyzed in a physical context and used for model-based predictive tasks."}, {"title": "A Wall-shear stress predictions with residual and Unet-based architectures", "content": "In this section, we present results of the single-configuration setup, i.e., using only the TCF at $Rer \\approx 1,000$, for two alternative architectures.

In contrast, the ResNet and the Unet based architectures predict a smoother distribution with less intense fluctuations. For the provided samples, the ResNet's performance is slightly better than the Unet's ability to predict accurate wall-shear stress fields. However, the governing (large-scale) flow features are similarly well predicted with all three architectures.\nTo investigate the networks' performance on experimental data in more detail, figure A.6 provides the pre-multiplied power spectra of the predicted wall-shear stress fields. The trends of the distributions are similar, but in contrast to the numerical test data, on which all three performed equally well (figure A.4), more distinct differences between the three architectures can be observed. The Unet's performance with respect to the smallest scales (IMF1) deviates from the two other networks, which explains why it was less accurate on an instantaneous level. For medium-size and large scales (IMF3 and 4), the ResNet based spectra indicate a slightly lower energetic level compared to the two other architectures. Thus, the ResNet presumably underestimates the intensity of large-scale flow structures in experimental settings."}]}

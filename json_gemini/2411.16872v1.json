{"title": "Enabling Adoption of Regenerative Agriculture through Soil Carbon Copilots", "authors": ["Margaret Capetz", "Swati Sharma", "Rafael Padilha", "Peder Olsen", "Emre Kiciman", "Ranveer Chandra"], "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires transforming agriculture to minimize environmental impact and build climate resilience. Regenerative agricultural practices enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thus improving soil health and sequestering carbon. A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management practices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The agricultural sector faces the simultaneous challenges of addressing climate change and feeding a growing population. As a result, we must concurrently enhance agricultural productivity, minimize environmental impact, and adapt agriculture to be resilient to a changing climate Walke et al. (2022). Previous research demonstrates the potential of regenerative agricultural practices for higher, more nutritious yields, improved soil health, and carbon sequestration capabilities Lal (2004). Though soil is a complex living medium, we can leverage remote sensing and machine learning to predict SOC, a proxy measurement for soil health Sharma et al. (2023a,b). Soil science research has demonstrated while regenerative practices, including composting and cover cropping, may improve soil, several other external factors, like extreme weather conditions, may lead to SOC loss."}, {"title": "1.1 Contributions", "content": "Our AI-enabled SOC Copilot makes significant advancements in data-driven agriculture by enabling serveral new use cases through large-scale data analysis. The copilot automates the complex process of ingesting comprehensive multi-resolution, multi-modal data from public sources, complemented by specialized machine learning models. Our contributions include:\nEnhanced Large-scale Data Accessibility Aggregating and enhancing existing datasets with AI-driven insights enables large-scale soil health analysis. This capability is crucial for advancing regenerative agricultural practices and understanding their impact on SOC. We demonstrate the capabilities of the copilot by generating SOC prediction data for the state of California, USA, for the years 2016 and 2023.\nTillage Detection at Scale Tillage plays a vital role in influencing changes in SOC. However, obtaining this data is often challenging. We conduct extensive pixel-based tillage detection across California with Coherent Change Detection (CCD) Preiss and Stacy (2006). To our knowledge, this is the first study to undertake large-scale tillage detection.\nPersonalized Stakeholder Engagement We provide tailored personas within the SOC Copilot, enabling customized, data-driven advice for various agricultural stakeholders.

By offering flexible model configurations, the copilot provides an financially viable solution for farmers from vulnerable communities, such as smallholder farmers. These farmers manage approximately 24% of world agricultural land Lowder et al. (2016); Ricciardi et al. (2018) and often lack access to expensive data-driven tools. Our solution ensures that smallholders are included in AI innovation for agriculture.\nImpactful Insights for Policy and Practice Our SOC Copilot provides practical analyses of factors influencing soil health, guiding better agricultural practices and policies. These insights are essential for creating evidence-based policies that enhance climate resilience.\nJustification and Impact of AI Methods Using AI in our solution is essential for managing and analyzing large volumes of complex, multi-modal data.

We qualitatively show the added value of the RAG-enabled SOC Copilot.\nInfluence of environmental factors at scale We test the large-scale data analysis capabilities of the SOC Copilot vs GPT-4 by asking how extreme weather events impact SOC change and if the trends align with scientific literature. From the question about drought effects in San Joaquin County, we see the SOC Copilot's access to SOC predictions enables it to provide localized, data-driven insights, shown in Table 5. We discover that more aggressive soil recovery efforts may be the cause of Sonoma County's SOC gain, while despite less intense wildfire conditions, Merced County experienced SOC loss, shown in Table 6. RAG enables the SOC Copilot to provide a more nuanced analysis of extreme weather effects on soil health.\nEffect of adopting regenerative practices In addition, we ask farm management-related questions.

All cloud free Sentinel-2 images in the relevant time window are also shown so the reader can verify the claims. The farmer reported tillage dates of 9/15, 9/14 and 10/5 for fields 2-4, while field 1 was no-till. The Figure shows a (weak) false detection for field 1, a slightly wrong date for field 2, tilling for two consecutive pairs of satellite passes for field 3 and a correct detection for field 4. After checking with the farmer, the date detected for field 2 which is somewhat later, appears to be correct. The recorded tillage date was in this case the intended date. Field 3 was very large and tilling persisted over several days, but only the start date was recorded. We can see the partial tilling both in the optical and the coherence images. We do not know the reason for the false detection for field 1, but it appears not to be weather related.

Since CCD will detect any kind of change it then becomes necessary to reduce the number of false positives. If there is any crop present its growth will register as change.

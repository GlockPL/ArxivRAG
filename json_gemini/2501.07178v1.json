While firms may suppress output or set higher prices to achieve higher profits than those achieved under competition, they often differ along several dimensions, such as their cost structure, capacities, logistics, production networks, sales force, or product quality. Indeed, asymmetries seem to be the rule rather than the exception\u00b9, and the conventional wisdom is that such asymmetries make (tacit) collusion more difficult (Ivaldi et al., 2003).\nThe challenge of collusion in asymmetric industries is two-dimensional. On the one hand, firms must (tacitly) agree on total output, and on the other hand, they must decide how to share the spoils of such collusion. In the case of a symmetric industry, collusion is easier because firms have the same preferences regarding total output, and sharing profits equally seems an intuitive and focal solution to the bargaining problem. In contrast, when firms are asymmetric, they disagree about the collusive level of total output, and profit sharing may prove cumbersome: Joint payoff maximization may require the inefficient firms to shut down. However, if all firms produce positive quantities, the outcome is inefficient, and a convex bargaining frontier emerges (Bishop, 1960, Schmalensee, 1987, Tirole, 1988). Coordinating on the two dimensions without explicit communication is usually considered to be difficult.2\nThe existing literature provides some insights into how asymmetric firms might collude, but there are limits to how the bargaining problem can be addressed. The theoretical literature mainly answers how asymmetric firms collude optimally (Harrington, 1991, Miklos-Thal, 2011), with or without side payments. However, the conditions under which asymmetric firms may be expected to find these optimal solutions to the bargaining problem, or to reach any alternative bargaining outcome, remain largely unexplored. The empirical literature on how firms maintain collusion in asymmetric industries, and in particular how they divide the spoils of collusion without side payments\u00b3 suffers from the availability of appropriate data. Assessing the extent of tacit collusion is difficult without robust counterfactuals, and cartel studies may be biased because they are based on detected antitrust cases. Several laboratory experiments (Fonseca and Normann, 2008, Argenton and M\u00fcller, 2012, Harrington et al., 2016, Fischer and Normann, 2019) have addressed this issue. A key finding of these experiments is that tacit collusion fails in asymmetric settings, but they cannot explain what successful collusion might look like."}, {"title": null, "content": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to this gap in the literature. Specifically, we analyze how self-learning algorithms share the profits of potentially colluding asymmetric firms. Methodologically, we solve the two-dimensional collusion problem by conducting a series of simulations with Q-learning algorithms (Watkins, 1989, Watkins and Dayan, 1992).\nHow an algorithm solves the simultaneous coordination and bargaining problems among asymmetric firms, is a subject of growing importance. Firms' decisions are increasingly being outsourced to algorithms across a variety of industries. Furthermore, even in situations where human decision-makers remain in control, they frequently receive algorithmic recommendations (see, for instance, Garcia et al., 2022, Huelden et al., 2024).\nWe run several different parameterizations of the repeated asymmetric Cournot duopoly. Starting from a symmetric baseline variant, we explore six different degrees of asymmetry between firms, and we consider two setups that differ in their parameterization. The main parameterization setup explores increasingly asymmetric firms while keeping the total output of the (static) Cournot-Nash equilibrium constant. In the second parameterization setup, the marginal cost parameter of the efficient firm is kept constant, so that monopoly output remains invariant in this setting. We run Q-learning simulations for these fourteen variants for different exploration and learning parameters, and for both algorithms with and without memory.\nOur main findings are as follows. Somewhat surprisingly, both consumers and firms can benefit from asymmetry. As firms become more asymmetric, the more efficient firm produces additional output. Some of these efficiency gains are indirectly shared with consumers. However, the algorithms in our setting do not implement fully efficient outcomes, according to which the inefficient firm is entirely inactive. Relative to joint profit maximization, algorithms produce more competitive outcomes when firms are symmetric, but less when they are asymmetric. Intuitively, the extreme benchmark of one firm staying inactive would require some form of compensation, for example, through side payments, which cannot be captured in our environment.\nOn the other extreme, Nash equilibrium (which assumes absence of coordination) underestimates the effect of asymmetry on total quantity but overestimates the effect on profits. Nevertheless, the two effects are similar in magnitude, and hence Nash equilibrium delivers surprisingly accurate predictions in terms of total welfare.\nEqual relative gains best describe our results, a solution criterion by Roth and Malouf (1979). The idea is that firms profit from collusion proportionally to their respective disagreement profits, that is, the profits they would obtain under competition. Intuitively, the firm that expects to make the largest profits under competition should experience a"}, {"title": "3 Model", "content": "We consider a standard Cournot duopoly, allowing for asymmetries in marginal costs. There are two firms \\(i \\in \\{L, H\\}\\) which simultaneously choose non-negative quantities \\(q_L\\) and \\(q_h\\) from the interval \\([0, q^{max}]\\). The firms only differ by their constant marginal production costs \\(c_i\\), with \\(c_H > c_L \\geq 0\\).

These will serve as benchmarks, when discussing the results in Section 5.\nTaking first-order conditions in the profit expression (1) immedi-\nately yields the standard static unique Nash equilibrium of the game:\n\\[q_i^{NE} = \\frac{a - 2c_i + c_j}{3b}\\]\nand equilibrium profits are \\(\\pi_i^{NE} = b(q_i^{NE})^2\\).\nFor joint profit maximization, only the cost-efficient firm\nL is active and produces its monopoly quantity, whereas the inefficient firm H stays out"}, {"title": null, "content": "of the market.

In our application, we assume that \\(\\omega = 0.5\\), that is, each of the firms is a monopolist with probability 50%, chooses \\(q^M\\) and earns \\(\\pi^{M}\\). For example, they may coordinate on being the monopolist alternately.\nThe previous three solutions are standard oligopoly benchmarks, but they may have infeasible profit allocation implications for colluding firms. The following bargaining so- lutions represent alternative predictions for the level and distribution of profits. Later in the paper, we sometimes refer to \"oligopoly benchmarks\" and \u201cbargaining solutions\" to distinguish the two sets of solutions.\nBargaining solutions assume that firms coordinate on the Pareto frontier. Each point on the Pareto frontier maximizes the profit that can be earned by one firm given a profit target for the other firm. To obtain the Pareto frontier, we rewrite the profit function as \\(q_i = \\pi_i/(p - c_i)\\), and then sum over both firms:\n\\[Q = \\frac{\\pi_i}{p-c_i} + \\frac{\\pi_j}{p-c_j}\\] (3)\nSolving for \\(\\pi_i\\) with \\(Q = \\frac{a-p}{b}\\) provides the Pareto frontier\n\\[\\pi_i( \\pi_j) = \\max \\big( \\frac{a-p}{b} - \\frac{\\pi_j}{p-c_j} \\big) (p - c_i).\\] (4)\nThat is, for any profit of firm i, a market price p can be found that maximizes the profit of firm j. Since costs are asymmetric and both firms produce positive quantities, the Pareto frontier is convex (Bishop, 1960, Schmalensee, 1987, Tirole, 1988). Although all bargaining concepts below assume that the solution lies on the Pareto frontier, they differ in the choice of a point on this frontier.\nKalai and Smorodinsky (1975) assume a profit split relative to\nthe maximum profit a firm can achieve (\\(\\pi^M\\)) and the profit under disagreement (\\(\\pi^{dis}\\)),\nthat is:"}, {"title": null, "content": "\\[\\frac{\\pi_i^{KS} - \\pi_i^{dis}}{\\pi_i^M - \\pi_i^{dis}} = \\frac{\\pi_j^{KS} - \\pi_j^{dis}}{\\pi_j^M - \\pi_j^{dis}}\\] (5)\nIn this specification, the maximum profit achievable is the one-firm monopoly profit. As disagreement profits (\\(\\pi^{dis}\\)), we consider (i) non-cooperative Nash profits (\\(\\pi^{NE}\\)) and (ii) min-max disagreement profits (\\(\\pi\\)). The latter are defined as the maximum profit a firm can achieve given that the other firm produces the maximum quantity at the upper bound of the action space, \\(q^{max}\\):\n\\[\\pi_i^{mm} = \\max_{q_i} \\pi_i(q_i, q^{max}).\\]\nThe Kalai-Smorodinsky solution to (5) is then implicitly defined by plugging (5) into the Pareto frontier expression in (4), and maximizing with respect to p.\nThis bargaining concept of Roth and Malouf (1979) also follows\nthe idea of profit sharing relative to the point of disagreement. However, it ignores the maximum (monopoly) profits:\n\\[\\frac{\\pi_i^{ERG}}{\\pi_i^{dis}} = \\frac{\\pi_j^{ERG}}{\\pi_j^{dis}}\\]\nAs with the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution, we consider here as disagreement profits (i) Nash profits and (ii) min-max profits.\nAn equal split solution according to Roth and Malouf (1979) implies that the bargaining point on the Pareto frontier ensures both firms receive the same payoff:\n\\[\\pi_i^{ES} = \\pi_j^{ES}\\]"}, {"title": "4 Experimental setup", "content": "We study seven different parameterizations, starting with symmetric firms and increasing\nthe level of cost asymmetry between the two firms.

We also examine the respective welfare implications.\nAs shown in Figure 1, panel (a), total quantities across asymmetry specifications center around Q \u2248 40. This falls between the theoretical benchmarks of static Nash level (48) and the collusive benchmark of alternating monopoly. The output produced by algorithms is restricted relative to the competitive benchmark. It provides evidence that the outcomes obtained by algorithms are collusive\nWe next investigate the effect of increasing asymmetry between firms. According to our simulation results, total quantity increases in asymmetry. However, for low levels of asymmetry, the simulated quantities are above the joint profit-maximizing solution (monopoly quantities), that is, the algorithms are less collusive than they could be. For high levels of asymmetry, in contrast, the simulated quantities are below the monopoly benchmark. In other words, algorithms produce more competitive outcomes (than sug- gested by models of collusion) when firms are symmetric but less collusive outcomes when they are very asymmetric. Importantly, this implies that asymmetric markets are rela- tively more collusive than symmetric ones.\nWhile these results indicate that algorithms yield collusive outcomes, they do not explain the underlying mechanisms. We abstain from investigating these forces for the time being and continue analyzing outcomes for the moment.

We may consider the relative distance of each concept to the simulation outcomes in Figure 1, separately for total quantities, consumer surplus, profits, and total welfare.\nAs asymmetry increases, bargaining solutions align increasingly well with simulated output, particularly equal relative gains (for both disagreement profits).

In contrast to collusion with symmetric firms where equal profit sharing is a natural candidate, profits of asymmetric firms under competition differ, making it unclear how profits should be split under collusion. This issue ultimately boils down to resolving an upfront bargaining problem over the spoils of collusion.\nIn Figure 3, we shed light on how algorithms solve the allocation bargaining problem. Panel (a) shows the outcomes for our main specification, where algorithms have a memory length of k = 1. The x-axis depicts the profits of the more efficient low-cost firm (\u03a0L) while the y-axis represents the profits of the inefficient high-cost firm (\u03a0H).\nThe solid and dotted lines show the Pareto frontiers of profits for different degrees of asymmetry. The steepest solid line corresponds to the Pareto frontier of the symmetric case, while the solid line with the flattest slope corresponds to the most asymmetric case (asym6). The dotted lines depict the Pareto frontiers of asym1 to asym5. Additionally, the figure depicts the profits obtained in our simulations (black dots), under equal relative gains (yellow squares), Nash equilibrium (purple squares), and min-max-disagreement (grey circle) for different degrees of asymmetry (0 = symmetry, 6 = most asymmetric).\nFor all degrees of asymmetry, our results lie close to the Pareto frontier, with profits significantly exceeding those of the Nash equilibrium for both firms. Profits achieved by the algorithms are more than double those under min-max-disagreement. What is particularly striking is that the profits are close to equal relative gains for all degrees of asymmetry, confirming our results from Section 5.2. This suggests that the idea underlying equal relative gains are a good description of how algorithms reconcile the allocation problem: The spoils of collusion are divided such that both firms gain from collusion equally much in relative terms, and, importantly, such that the total profits are close to the Pareto frontier."}, {"title": "Algorithmic sophistication", "content": "A common concern in the analysis of self-learning al- gorithms regards the question of algorithmic sophistication, especially when algorithms obtain supra-competitive outcomes as in our setting (see, for instance, Calvano et al., 2023, Epivent and Lambin, 2024). Do the algorithms obtain high profits either because they are sufficiently sophisticated to develop strategies that support these outcomes, or are these outcomes rather a consequence precisely of the lack of sophistication, leaving gains of exploiting an innocent cooperator on the table? To address these concerns, we provide two pieces of evidence. First, we investigate the outcomes that the algorithms would obtain if we do not endow them with any mem- ory (k = 0). This mechanically prevents the emergence of any reward-and-punishment schemes typically encountered in collusive strategies. Not allowing the firms to condition their outcomes on previous periods' actions effectively renders the game static, so that the Nash outcomes become the unique (subgame-perfect) equilibrium of the game. The results of these simulations are shown in panel (b) of Figure 3. For all degrees of asymmetry (0 = symmetry, 6 = most asymmetric), our simulation results (black circles) are very close to the Nash equilibrium outcomes (grey circles) and well below the Pareto frontier. This is in sharp contrast to the results we obtained when we endowed the agents with memory (k = 1 in panel (a)). To further investigate algorithmic sophistication, we provide a second piece of evidence by examining the incentives to deviate from the strategy prescribed by the Q-matrix upon convergence. Following Calvano et al. (2020), for each simulation, agent i, and parameterization of the game, we compute the static best response to the strategy of"}, {"title": null, "content": "the other player. Note that this computation is beyond the knowledge available to the algorithms and hence accessible only to us, setting the bar for algorithmic sophistication very high. It allows the deviating agent to gain the maximum one-period deviation profit.\nTo evaluate the profitability, for both approaches, we simulate that agent i deviates to the respective action once. Subsequently, we simulate outcomes for 40 periods using the Q-matrices of both agents upon convergence. We then compute the fraction of simulations in which such a one-shot deviation was profitable. We consider a deviation profitable when the sum of discounted profits is higher under deviation compared to no deviation. For discounting, we consider the deviation period as t = 0 and \u03b4 = 0.95 as in the initial Q-learning simulation."}, {"title": "5.4 Robustness checks", "content": "The cost parameterizations of our main specification generally only depicts one of infinitely many possible cost asymmetries. Although chosen thoughtfully by keeping constant total Nash quantities, we provide an alternative cost parameterization in Appendix C. Under the alternative cost parameterization, the one-firm monopoly output is kept constant (that is, cL = 19) while we increase the costs of the high-cost firm cH. For this exercise, we focus on moderate exploration (v = 21). Qualitatively, the results are similar to our main specification. Firms reduce total quantities well below the Nash prediction and the profit split lies on the Pareto frontier for all cases.

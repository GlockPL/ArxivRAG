By capitalizing on this potential, we can achieve significant productivity gains, cost savings, and positive economic impacts across the broader economy. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce an integrated software ecosystem combining Data Mesh and Service Mesh architecture that encompasses the largest training data for infrastructure, procurement, scientific publications, activities and risk information with 100B+ tokens along with a systematic AI framework. Our system, underpinned by a Knowledge Graph linked to multi-agents for domain-specific tasks and Q&A capabilities. By standardizing and ingesting data from diverse sources, we transform raw data into structured knowledge. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and automation, our system sets new standards for data structuring and automated knowledge creation, assisting in decision-making for early-stage project planning, in-depth project research, market trend analysis, and qualitative assessments. The web-scalable architecture streams domain-curated information, providing a foundation for AI agents to facilitate reasoning and uncertainty elicitation, and supporting future expansions through specialized agents for specific challenges. By systematically integrating AI with industry domain knowledge, this work not only enhances efficiency and decision-making in the construction and infrastructure sectors but also lays a foundation for addressing broader government efficiency. We believe this work will contribute significantly to future AI-driven endeavors in this industry and inform best practices in AI Ops, accelerating the transformation of any analog industry to digital workflows.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Data and technology have historically revolutionized industries by enhancing efficiency, productivity, and profitability. Sectors such as advertising, banking, healthcare, and real estate have undergone significant transformations. Yet, the global construction industry a foundational sector that shapes our physical world-remains a notable exception. Despite being the largest and most capital-intensive industry, directly impacting the planet through extensive infrastructure development [1], [2], it has not fully embraced data-driven transformation. Productivity has stagnated [3], and profit margins remain narrow [4], [5].\nAt the heart of this inertia lies a critical challenge: the lack of universally available, reliable, and relevant data to inform mission-critical decisions. Conversations with over 100 industry leaders reveal a consensus that this data deficiency is the root cause of systemic inefficiencies. The industry's global sprawl and complexity have allowed it to sidestep traditional regulatory jurisdictions, resulting in fragmented, dispersed, and non-uniform data practices. Unlike other industries, there are no standardized requirements for reporting activities, retaining records, or even common formats for information dissemination. This lack of standardized and accessible data is compounded by the pivotal role of government as a primary driver of infrastructure spending, further complicating transparency and efficiency in decision-making.\nGovernment plays a pivotal role as the primary driver of infrastructure construction spending, involving a wide array of products, materials, and services. Government expenditure constitutes a substantial portion of GDP-ranging from around 20% in countries like Guyana, Ireland, and Niger to over 50% in France, Italy, and Belgium [6]. Public procurement alone accounts for approximately 12% of global GDP, amounting to $11 trillion out of a nearly $90 trillion global GDP in 2018 [7]. However, the complexity of tracking procurement and spending across multiple levels of government-national, state, city, county, metro, road authority, and energy sectors-compounds the challenge. The lack of transparency and data standards hinders efficiency and accountability in government spending.\nThis systemic issue has profound implications. For example, a construction firm seeking bridge construction opportunities globally faces the daunting task of accessing procurement announcements from thousands of non-uniform sources across different regions. This fragmentation limits the industry's ability to identify opportunities, assess risks, and make informed decisions at scale.\nThe consequences are evident in the industry's historical inefficiencies. Major infrastructure projects frequently suffer from cost overruns and delays. Honolulu's rail transit line, initially estimated at $4 billion, ballooned to $11.4 billion, with a target completion date of 2031 [8]. Similarly, California's high-speed rail project from Los Angeles to San Francisco, originally budgeted at $33 billion, is now projected to cost $100 billion and be completed by 2033 [9]. These cases illustrate common issues of cost escalation, engineering challenges, and political obstacles that plague major infrastructure projects worldwide. These inefficiencies are exacerbated by systemic cost escalations, engineering challenges, and delays, reflecting deeper structural issues within the sector.\nThe stakes are high for all stakeholders. Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) firms routinely achieve low single-digit margins while assuming undefined risks. Suppliers struggle with demand visibility, leading to supply chain inefficiencies. Government sponsors expend enormous resources during project planning, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes. The lack of a common, accessible archive of industry data limits stakeholders' ability to learn from previous activities, evaluate partners, and properly assess risks. By introducing automation at scale, the system can adapt to regional contexts, ensuring that insights are not only accurate but also globally scalable, overcoming traditional barriers to data standardization in infrastructure projects.\nMoreover, the industry faces new challenges that intensify the urgency for transformation. Since 2020, approximately 82.5% of construction materials have experienced significant cost increases, with an average jump of 19% [10]. The price index for steel mill products more than doubled, soaring nearly 142% from October 2020 to November 2021 [11]. These surges, compounded by labor shortages exacerbated by COVID-19-induced retirements and health concerns [12], delay projects and escalate costs, affecting the entire supply chain and economy.\nClimate change further complicates the landscape. Extreme heat causes materials like steel and concrete to expand and degrade more rapidly, leading to failures in railways, roads, and power lines [13]. Our infrastructure is simply becoming too hot to function effectively. Adapting to these realities requires transparency and visibility into demand and inventory to navigate future uncertainties. This transparency is critical not only for managing inflation and supply chain disruptions but also for building resilience against climate-related stresses.\nDemographic shifts add another layer of complexity. With 41% of the construction workforce expected to retire by 2030 [14], there is a pressing need to counteract impending human capital turnover. Traditionally reliant on human judgment and networks, the industry must now integrate human and Al systems to enhance productivity. Large language models (LLMs) and data-driven AI systems can serve as cognitive capital, preserving and building upon the knowledge of experts even as experienced personnel retire. These trends underline the growing need for systemic change, driven by advanced technologies that can align operational efficiency with the sector's evolving demands.\nThe urgency for transformation is underscored by the forecasted $130 trillion investment in infrastructure upgrades over the next five years [15]. This unprecedented investment creates both opportunities and challenges. Companies and governments must adopt advanced technologies to maximize this investment efficiently. Competitive pressures and historically low margins will drive stakeholders to embrace these technologies or risk being left behind.\nAddressing these multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive approach that leverages advanced technologies, integrates cognitive capital, and establishes clear data standards. We introduce a dual-layered AI approach to tackle these issues: the foundational Mechanical AI and the advanced Thinking Al. Mechanical AI centralizes and structures raw data into a predictive toolset, bridging knowledge gaps and enhancing clarity across the sector. Thinking AI leverages this structured data to apply expert reasoning to multi-modal data from project reports, public procurement documents, forward-looking plans, and systematic web-scale information to inform strategic decision-making.\nAt the core of this technological leap is the Data Mesh, a vast infrastructure dataset integrating diverse data sources and constantly updating. This mesh standardizes information, enabling a wide range of analyses and insights within construction entities and related fiscal research and government-entity analysis. The Data Mesh tracks over across 1.5 million project records, 27 million tender records, and 600,000 brownfield assets, including alternative data sources like PDFs, planning documents, and scalable web content. It also houses 10 billion records related to risk activities and construction engineering research sources, revealing nearly 2.3 million new entities. These efforts establish robust data standards for an industry historically devoid of such norms, significantly enhancing foundational visibility."}, {"title": "II. DATA MESH AND SERVICE MESH ARCHITECTURE", "content": "The evolution of data architecture in recent years has prominently featured data lakes, designed to alleviate data management bottlenecks and enhance decision-making capabilities [16]. However, the centralized nature of data lakes has exposed significant limitations, especially in handling the proliferation of data sources and the increasing demand for timely analysis and processing [17]. To address these challenges, the Data Mesh paradigm has emerged, advocating for a decentralized approach where data ownership is distributed across domains, coupled with federated governance to oversee data integrity and accessibility [17], [18].\nData Mesh posits that decentralizing data ownership to domain-specific teams-those who best understand the context and use cases of their data-enhances data quality and relevance [17]. This paradigm shift is particularly relevant in the context of infrastructure construction, where data is often fragmented and siloed across various entities and jurisdictions [18]. The integration of federated learning strategies within Data Mesh architectures facilitates the generation of robust data products without the need for sharing raw data, thereby preserving data privacy and security [19].\nThe adoption of Data Mesh and AI in infrastructure construction offers broader implications for good practices in data management a foundational step to build levels of intelligence for this industry. The decentralized nature of Data Mesh promotes data democratization, enabling domain experts to directly contribute to data quality and relevance [17]. This model can be extended to other industries facing similar challenges with data fragmentation and siloed information [18], [20].\nMoreover, the use of federated learning and AI within Data Mesh architectures represents a convergence of cutting-edge technologies that improve data security, privacy, and utility. By decentralizing data ownership and integrating advanced AI capabilities, organizations can achieve greater transparency, efficiency, and strategic foresight in their operations [19], [21].\nComplexity of Foundational Data in Infrastructure Construction\nThe advent of the digital era has ushered various industries into the realm of data-driven decision-making. However, unlike e-commerce or social media that thrive on standardized data ecosystems, the construction and infrastructure sectors face unique, complex data challenges.\nVariable Data Volume and Lack of Standardization Infrastructure projects exhibit a wide range in scale and scope, resulting in variable data volumes. For instance, a minor local road repair project contrasts sharply with the data generated from constructing a multi-billion-dollar bridge. The absence of a centralized or standardized platform similar to MLS or Redfin in real estate exacerbates this challenge, underscoring a sector characterized by disparate, fragmented, and decentralized data sources. Standardization of these data, particularly in defining key primary and secondary attributes, emerges as a fundamental hurdle.\nDiverse Update Frequencies The update frequencies of data sources within the infrastructure domain vary significantly. Procurement data might be updated daily, while foundational project details could undergo updates quarterly or annually. This variation complicates the timely analysis and integration of data, hindering the ability to make informed decisions.\nInconsistent Data Fields Data inconsistencies between different agencies, countries, or private entities manifest themselves in varied fields, formats, and terminologies. Such discrepancies challenge effective data integration and analysis, necessitating a robust approach to standardize and aggregate data for coherent use.\nA. Data Mesh\nThe foundation of our solution is the proprietary data-mesh, which represents the re-creation of foundational data for the global industry. Building the Data-mesh involved three steps: 1) collecting original source data and autonomously standardizing it, 2) enriching the data via classical ML, genAI and LLM in a web-scalable manner, and finally, 3) tagging, standardizing and organizing it for scale.\nCollecting Original Source Data We have created a proprietary process to extract the infra-specific information from over 10,000 distinct global project websites. Currently, the world's construction data (opportunities, conditions, participant records, risks, outcomes, etc.) is distributed in every corner of the world through tens of thousands of individual governments. multilateral and private sources, aggregates these records from disparate sources on a daily basis. The categories of data sources collected and standardized include:\nOfficial Government Project Sources\nPublic Procurement Sources\nThird Party Project Sources\nAlt Government Data\nColleges & Universities\nPublic Company Filings\nEngineering Journal Publications\nActivities, Conditions, and Risks Data Sources\nCapital Improvement Plan PDFs\nThe types of data collected from these sources typically include project and tender announcements, sponsoring agency, project status, participating stakeholders, budgets, timelines, etc.\nEnriching Data via AI Much of the industry's data is not easily found. The lack of global standards for publishing opportunities or reporting activity means that there is wide variability in the kind of data that is reported. Since not all official sources include the same information,will augment missing information where possible by employing knowledge graphs and proprietary LLM methods to augment data and improve completeness.\nStandardizing, Tagging and Organizing\nOnce the data are aggregated and enriched, every global record is standardized, tagged, and organized to essentially create one harmonized Data Mesh ready to be mined at scale. Our Data Mesh represents the largest standardized repository of prospective project and procurement records in the world, all curated to identify business opportunities or inform critical decisions around risk, due diligence or market activity.\nAt the heart of 's innovation lies its proprietary Data-Mesh architecture, a decentralized framework designed to revolution-ize data collection, processing, and accessibility in construction and infrastructure projects. This architecture amalgamates standardized datasets from a plethora of decentralized sources, providing a unified, accessible endpoint via REST APIs. The design philosophy behind this approach emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and the facilitation of AI-driven insights, thereby addressing critical inefficiencies in the sector.\nTaiy\u014d.AI employs a monolithic repository to manage its Data Mesh architecture effectively. This repository is meticulously organized to facilitate the development, deployment, and maintenance of data products (DP). Each DP resides within its dedicated subdirectory, encapsulating its source code, de-ployment scripts, and dependencies. The structure emphasizes modularity and reusability, with components such as web scrapers for data extraction, cleaning modules, geocoding services, and standardization scripts. This approach ensures that each data product can be independently curated, standardized, and maintained, aligning with the principles of Data Mesh and Service Mesh architectures.\nCode Standards and Quality Assurance\nTo maintain high code quality, stringent coding practices are adopted. Data formatting follows a consistent standard to ensure uniformity across datasets. Linting checks are performed to identify and rectify code quality issues, adhering to best practices and enhancing maintainability.\nThe Imperative of Data Standardization and Aggregation"}, {"title": "II. SYSTEMATIC AI FRAMEWORK FOR REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS", "content": "addressing the data challenge in AI for industry-specific solutions requires a concerted effort to build, standardize, and maintain a comprehensive data ecosystem. This endeavor not only promises to streamline decision-making processes, but also illuminates pathways to innovation and efficiency in a traditionally data-fragmented sector.\nThe digital age has propelled various industries into an era of data-driven decision-making. However, while sectors like e-commerce or social media benefit from standardized data structures, industries like construction and infrastructure grapple with more complex challenges.\nThe challenges outlined above necessitate a novel approach, one that combines modern data architectures with domain-specific knowledge. Enter modular approach, rooted in Data Mesh and Service Mesh concepts.\nData Mesh & Service Mesh: At its core, the Data Mesh philosophy emphasizes decentralizing data ownership and architecture, allowing domain experts to curate and maintain their data products. Service Mesh, on the other hand, focuses on the inter-service communication, ensuring reliable data flow across modules6.\nBenefits of Decentralization: By distributing responsibility and ownership, ensures that data is continuously updated, refined, and maintained by those closest to the source. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also promotes scalability and adaptability to changes7.\nData Products: Central to system is the concept of \"Data Products\". These are modular units of data, curated, standard-ized, and maintained independently. Each Data Product can cater to a specific aspect of infrastructure be it procurement data, project details, or external risk factors.\nWeb Scrapers: To populate these Data Products, employs Python web scrapers. These scrapers, designed with domain knowledge, extract data from diverse sources, ensuring that it adheres to the platform's standardization protocols. The flexibility of Python, combined with its extensive libraries for web scraping like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy, makes it an ideal choice for this task. LLMs are also used in certain instances where applicable, however this falls in less than 30% of global sources.\nLive GenAI Augmentation: leverages the power of gen-erative AI (GenAI) to enhance real-time data processing and decision-making capabilities. This system utilizes a combina-tion of web-scalable technologies and advanced AI to provide the latest information on specific subjects, such as entities or individual construction projects, which may be segmented into sub-components. The platform integrates a proprietary Data Mesh along with a large language model (LLM) pipeline, enabling the creation of domain-curated project summaries and the execution of complex analyses. Through this system, multiple specialized AI agents can be invoked to address distinct tasks or challenges, thereby providing tailored solutions based on live data and real-time updates.\nGround Truth: In grounding the digital conversation, theKnowledge Graph utilizes a blend of proprietary and web-sourced data, ensuring a scalable and reliable foundation for project insights. This graph structures data around identified subjects, as determined by end users, and employs sophisticated algorithms to maintain accuracy and relevance.

Data Product as a Unit and Their Components", "content": "The life-cycle of a data product within the ecosystem encompasses five critical stages: Scraping, Cleaning, Standardization, GeoCoding, and Ingestion. This life-cycle begins with the meticulous gathering of data across diverse domains-ranging from project specifics and tender details to broader economic indicators and policy landscapes. Each data product undergoes rigorous processing to ensure its reliability and relevance, which serves as a foundational element for AI and machine learning applications aimed at predictive analytics, risk assessment, and strategic planning.\n1) Lifecycle of a Data Product: The lifecycle of a data product within this software ecosystem is a process involving several stages, from initial data identification to final integration into a Data Mesh. Figure 4 illustrates the detailed lifecycle and its various stages. The process begins with the identification of the source of information. Depending on the source, appropriate parameterization and scraping methods are implemented to extract the necessary data. The extracted data is then subjected to a series of analysis functions for cleaning, geocoding, and standardization, which are crucial for ensuring data quality and consistency.\nOnce the data product has been prepared, it is deployed to a workflow orchestration tool that schedules and executes the workflow at predefined intervals. During each scheduled run, the data product workflow initiates, starting with the extraction of data using the specified parameterization and scraping techniques to capture only the relevant data. This data is subsequently cleaned, geocoded, and standardized using Arc's proprietary tool designed for common utilities.\nThe next phase involves loading the data into the data mesh, which encompasses three critical steps: data validation to ensure correct data formats and types (e.g., dates in yyyy-mm-dd format), the addition of metadata such as the data product's name and version, and the execution of the ingestion pipeline to incorporate the data into the data mesh. If entries already exist in reference dictionaries, enrichment is applied automatically; otherwise, they appear as DELTA entries, which the enrichment team handles for configuration and updating reference dictionaries.\nThe enrichment process is carried out via Zoetic Bots and Orchestrator, framework for batch jobs. The enriched data is then updated in the data mesh. Intermediate data is stored in Object-Storage using Arc in Parquet file format, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval. This systematic engineering approach ensures that data products are consistently high-quality, well-integrated, and ready for use in various analytical and operational applications.\nDevelopment and Implementation\nTechnical Foundation and Environment Setup To engage with 's data products, stakeholders are equipped with a compre-hensive guide covering the necessary tools and software.

This process also involves the critical task of identifying and merging duplicate records, thereby ensuring the uniqueness and reliability of the data. Furthermore, specialized tags and categorizations, including sector & tags, are applied to facilitate advanced data analytics and insights.\nOne of the most challenging aspects of this process was the standardization of disparate data sources in a unified manner. The diversity of data formats, terminologies, and standards across sources presented a significant hurdle.\nHowever, through the development of a robust internal ap-plication framework, has effectively automated the enrichment process. This framework dynamically adapts to varying data structures and standards, enabling the seamless integration and standardization of data.\nThe Significance of Enriched Attributes\nThe importance of enriched attributes within the ecosystem cannot be overstated. These attributes play a pivotal role in enhancing the granularity, relevance, and standardization of data, thereby empowering stakeholders with comprehensive and actionable insights. For instance, the enrichment of country and status attributes ensures that users can perform geo-specific trend analyses and project status assessments. Similarly, the augmentation of budget information and the introduction of sector & tags enable more precise financial planning and sectoral analysis.\nIn addition, automation of the enrichment process and its daily execution within the ecosystem underscores the commitment of the platform to maintain the most current, accurate, and enriched dataset in the global construction and infrastructure sectors.

Knowledge Graph and Representation", "content": "B. Knowledge Representation and Handling"}, {"content": "The systematic AI framework within is centered around a Central AI Agent complemented by a suite of Multi-Agents. This framework exemplifies advanced data integration and visualization techniques tailored for infrastructure projects. The Central AI Agent utilizes domain-specific language and a modular approach, allowing for a \"human-in-the-loop\" process that guides the creation of knowledge from standardized AI data and scalable web sources. This knowledge is then linked to various Multi-Agents, each designed for hyper-specific tasks, such as researching the latest project updates or extracting best practices from top-tier journal publications. Other agents, including multi-modal ones, are equipped to understand and analyze local environmental conditions, assess risks, or conduct in-depth comparative research on past projects to inform qualitative judgments.\nA key feature of this framework is its focus on uncertainty quantification and transparency. The system continuously calls underlying processes to ensure that results are robust and reliable this is one of its distinguishing factors. Beyond the deployment of Multi-Agents, the framework includes Meta-Agents capable of real-time market analysis. These Meta-Agents can scan 's data, news sources, and the web to either compile a comprehensive list of opportunities or provide a completed market landscape view to understand stakeholder dynamics.\nThe framework's modularity extends to its internal workspace, designed to mitigate risks associated with downtime or latency. This workspace keeps various large language models (LLMs) modular, enabling the system to call upon different models\u2014such as GPT-4o, Mistral, LLaMA, or other configurations like RAG or graphRAG - depending on the specific use case for Multi-Agents.\nTo illustrate the practical application of this framework, consider the challenge of managing and interpreting the multitude of data associated with large infrastructure projects. These projects often involve wide-reaching impacts, making it essential to accurately integrate diverse data sources such as recent news, internet publications, and bibliometrics. The integration must clarify the project's status, assess risks, identify stakeholders, and visualize its development over time.\nThe Knowledge Graph embodies a sophisticated structure designed to enhance and structure real-world data for more insightful decision making. Using a triplet architecture that comprises subject, lexicon, and object, this system forms the foundational framework for a highly adaptable and dynamic knowledge graph. Grounded in a diverse array of data sources including the internet, news media, and technical engineering research publications, the graph integrates these elements in a modular fashion, providing a robust platform for augmenting real-world knowledge structuring.\nKnowledge Graphs (KG) represent a leap forward in structuring and utilizing data, offering a dynamic and interconnected framework that enhances data accessibility and interoperability. In enterprise settings, KGs facilitate a deeper understanding of complex relationships between diverse data points, enabling more informed decision-making processes [23]\u2013[25]. Their application in construction and infrastructure can revolutionize how projects are conceptualized, planned, and executed, by providing a holistic view of project data, stakeholders, and external factors.\nImplementation Details\nSymbolic Subjects: The graph often begins with a symbolic subject when precise starting points are not defined. For example, selecting a geographical location like California and a sector such as airports may not correspond to a pre-existing RDF node or structure. This symbolic starting point allows for the construction of a predicate-based filter to navigate through related tenders and data, fostering more open-ended explorations within a controlled attribute subset.\nLiterals and Lazy Loading: To support this dynamic structure, literals are employed within an abstract syntax tree. Much like the triplet itself, the specialty of these literals lies in their 'lazy load' capability; they are not pre-populated across every node or edge but are instead created on demand based on user interactions. This method emphasizes efficiency and relevance, tailoring the data presented to the needs of the user journey.\nComplex Predicate Equations: The relationship between the subject and object in the Knowledge Graph is not merely a straightforward predicate but involves complex equations with variable weightings. This nuanced approach allows for a deeper and more precise interpretation of the data relationships, enhancing the graph's ability to reflect real-world complexities.\nSystem Implementation of Subject/Object: The imple-mentation of the subject/object system within the Knowledge Graph involves specific types of literals. These literals vary in definition and application, providing a flexible yet structured way to encode and retrieve knowledge.\nLexicon: Lexical Relation between Subject and Object is consideration of all Subject/Object Properties, their match level/types/algorithms and weighted priorities."}, {"title": "B. Knowledge Representation and Handling", "content": "Literals Literals are fundamental data structures imple-mented using AST Vectors from Platform.

The platform implementation of knowledge graph and its specific version is fundamentally based on lazy load and exploration while traversing principles to maintain system performance and user experience. So AST here is specially a Lazy AST based on data vectors.\nSubject/Objects Subject/Objects have properties and prop-erty values. There are multiple sub definition types for Subject.

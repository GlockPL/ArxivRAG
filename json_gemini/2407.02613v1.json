The Rothermel Model, pivotal in predicting fire behavior, underpins many modern simulation methods. It calculates the rate of fire spread based on fuel properties, topographical features, and meteorological conditions, thus providing a foundational understanding of fire dynamics [10-12]. Integrating Genetic Algorithms (GAs) into wildfire simulations has marked a significant leap in enhancing predictive accuracy and adaptability. By emulating evolutionary processes, GAs refine parameters in simulation models, bolstering their adaptability to diverse environmental contexts. This technique has shown effectiveness in customizing models like the Rothermel Model for local conditions, thereby augmenting their forecasting accuracy [5].\nRecent research has highlighted Perlin Noise as a novel terrain generation method in world simulations, contributing to the creation of realistic and varied landscapes. This technique, utilizing a gradient noise function, crafts terrains that significantly influence fire behavior and spreading patterns, aligning with efforts to include intricate environmental elements in fire dynamics models [13, 14].\nOur methodology, centered on Perlin Noise for world simulation, presents a pioneering stride in this field. Segmenting the generated Perlin noise into distinct environmental categories allows for a nuanced representation of diverse landscapes, crucial for comprehending fire spread across varied terrains [15, 16]. Our approach, integrating sophisticated terrain modeling in fire simulations, significantly advances the replication of real-world fire scenarios [17-19].\nAn enhanced approach to wildfire simulation entails incorporating comprehensive environmental data, such as forest maps, terrain elevation, and historical weather patterns. These datasets provide critical insights into tree types, fuel content, age, elevation, and weather metrics, imperative for precise wind modeling via finite state models and fluid mechanics.

In MARL, each agent operates within Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with their actions intricately influencing the dynamics of states and rewards. This concept is particularly pertinent in wildfire management, where a myriad of entities such as firefighters, drones, and environmental factors interact in a shared ecosystem [29, 30]. Markov Games, in this context, model the interplay between multiple agents, whose collective decisions and actions determine state transitions and rewards. In wildfire management, these games can simulate various firefighting teams or autonomous systems operating in tandem or contention [30, 31].\nCooperative MARL settings, where agents unite towards a common objective like wildfire suppression, can be conceptualized as multi-agent MDPs (MMDPs) or team Markov games. Here, the collective effort is channeled towards a unified reward function [32, 33]. In competitive MARL settings, such as zero-sum games, agents' goals are diametrically opposed, akin to competing land management agencies in wildfire scenarios. This setting is reflective of scenarios where each party's gain is another's loss [30, 34].\nThe mixed setting in MARL, or general-sum games, aptly represents wildfire management scenarios with overlapping yet distinct objectives among diverse groups. This setting accommodates the complexities and nuances of real-world situations [35, 36]. Extensive-form games adeptly handle scenarios with imperfect information, a common hurdle in wildfire management. Agents' decision-making is based on limited or uncertain environmental information, mirroring the unpredictability inherent in real-world wildfires [37, 38].\nSeveral studies exemplify MARL applications in wildfire management:\n\u2022 Collaborative Auto-Curricula: Siedler (2022) investigates a MARL system with a Graph Neural Network communication layer for efficient resource distribution in wildfire management, underscoring the value of agent collaboration [39].\n\u2022 UAVs and Deep Q-Learning: Viseras et al.

(2023) concentrate on distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for UAV swarm navigation in wildfire monitoring, showcasing advanced coordination techniques [42].\nIntegrating MARL into wildfire management is pivotal in developing robust, autonomous systems for effective wildfire response. MARL's complex interaction models lay the theoretical groundwork for designing advanced simulation algorithms and optimizing strategies for wildfire prevention, control, and mitigation [29, 30]. Future research in this arena could focus on devising sophisticated algorithms that bolster collaboration among autonomous agents, enhance decision-making amidst uncertainty, and support real-time adaptive strategies.

The FPS provides insight into the computational efficiency of the training process. An overall downward trend or significant drops in FPS may indicate computational bottlenecks or increased complexity in the simulation as the training progresses. The Approximate KL Divergence, depicted in Figure 4.14, measures how the policy distribution changes over time. Spikes in KL divergence can suggest significant policy updates, which could either be beneficial as the agents explore new strategies or detrimental if the policy diverges too much from the previous one, potentially leading to instability in training. The Clip Fraction, shown in Figure 4.15, indicates the fraction of the agent's probability ratio that was clipped by the PPO algorithm. This metric helps in understanding the extent to which the policy is being constrained and can also reflect the stability of the training process. Figure 4.16 shows the clip range, which is the range within which the probability ratio is constrained. A constant clip range, as observed, suggests a stable constraint over the policy updates throughout the training. Entropy loss, visualized in Figure 4.17, describes the randomness in the policy distribution. A higher entropy can encourage exploration by the agents, while a lower entropy indicates a more deterministic policy. Ideally, entropy should decrease over time as the policy converges to an optimal strategy. The explained variance metric, in Figure 4.18, measures how well the value function predicts the rewards. Values closer to 1 indicate better predictions, which can lead to more efficient learning by the agents.

Computational efficiency remained a concern, particularly in the MARL setting, where the increase in agents led to a more complex state space and action space. Moreover, the initial instability during training, reflected by the fluctuations in the frames per second (FPS), suggested that our computational resources were stretched at times. Additionally, while the PPO algorithm was effective, it was not without shortcomings.

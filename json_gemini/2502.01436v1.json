{"title": "TOWARDS SAFER CHATBOTS: A FRAMEWORK FOR POLICY COMPLIANCE EVALUATION OF CUSTOM GPTS", "authors": ["David Rodriguez", "William Seymour", "Jose M. Del Alamo", "Jose Such"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained unprecedented prominence, achieving widespread adoption across diverse domains and integrating deeply into society. The capability to fine-tune general-purpose LLMs, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), for specific tasks, domains, or requirements has facilitated the emergence of numerous Custom GPTs. These tailored models are increasingly made available through dedicated marketplaces, such as OpenAI's GPT Store. However, the black-box nature of the models introduces significant safety and compliance risks. In this work, we present a scalable framework for the automated evaluation of Custom GPTs against OpenAI's usage policies, which define the permissible behaviors of these systems. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) automated discovery and data collection of models from the GPT store, (2) a red-teaming prompt generator tailored to specific policy categories and the characteristics of each target GPT, and (3) an LLM-as-a-judge technique to systematically analyze each prompt-response pair for potential policy violations.\nWe validate our framework with a manually annotated ground truth, and evaluate it through a large-scale study evaluating 782 Custom GPTs across three categories: Romantic, Cybersecurity, and Academic GPTs. Our manual annotation process achieved an F1 score of 0.975 in identifying policy violations, confirming the reliability of the framework's assessments. The evaluation results reveal that 58.7% of the analyzed models exhibit indications of non-compliance, exposing weaknesses in the GPT store's review and approval processes. Furthermore, our findings indicate that a model's popularity does not correlate with its compliance level, and non-compliance issues largely stem from behaviors inherited from base models rather than user-driven customizations.\nOur framework provides a viable solution for large-scale policy compliance evaluation, enhancing the safety of personalized LLMs and supporting systematic enforcement of usage policies. We believe this approach is extendable to other chatbot platforms and policy domains, improving LLM-based systems safety.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The advent of Transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism [1] marked a turning point in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the development of Large Language Models (LLMs).

This process presented several challenges due to the lack of direct API access to these chatbots. Consequently, the module leverages the ChatGPT web application, automating interactions via Puppeteer [10] to interact with the Custom GPTs. Browser sessions are configured with stored credentials, eliminating the need for repeated logins and further enhancing the operational robustness. Finally, we carefully designed our interaction to reduce request rates to the limits set by OpenAI, thus ensuring that our activities do not disrupt regular OpenAI operations or overload their services. These customizations enable the module to retrieve metadata and conduct conversational interactions required for compliance assessment.\nThe module operates in two distinct phases:\n\u2022 Phase I. This phase focuses on identifying and gathering metadata for candidate Custom GPTs to enable compliance evaluations. The module uses the GPT store's search bar to query targeted keywords, (e.g., relationship, hacking, homework) matching to specific policy categories. For each identified GPT, all available metadata-including its name, description, developer, number of chats, and user ratings\u2014is retrieved. This metadata provides insights into each GPT's intended functionality, popularity, and developer activity, while also forming the basis for generating tailored evaluation prompts. To enhance flexibility, the module is configured to allow this phase to run independently, retrieving a complete list of GPTs and their metadata for subsequent processing, or to retrieve and process each GPT sequentially during evaluation. The metadata is stored in a structured format to foster reproducibility and support post-hoc analyses of compliance patterns.\n\u2022 Phase II. In this phase, the module sends the generated prompts to the target GPT and collects its responses. At the time of development, the GPT store imposed a rate limit of 50 messages per three hours for paid accounts. The framework incorporates automated mechanisms to manage this constraint, dynamically pausing operations when the limit is reached and resuming them as soon as the restriction lifts. These mechanisms ensure the uninterrupted processing of evaluations while adhering to platform-imposed restrictions. Additionally, the framework is designed to adapt to future changes in rate limits by detecting the platform's response patterns and adjusting execution schedules accordingly. After processing all prompts for a GPT, the interaction transcript is securely logged for compliance evaluation, and the conversation is deleted."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Red-teaming Prompts Generator", "content": "This module leverages GPT-40 API to generate ten prompts specifically designed to test each Custom GPT's compliance with a given policy. The process leverages the metadata retrieved during Phase I to craft prompts tailored to the GPT's description and intended functionality. Prompts are categorized into two types:\n1. Direct Prompts. These are explicit queries aimed at evaluating a Custom GPT's adherence to specific policy requirements without obfuscation.\n2. Deceptive Prompts. These employ strategies such as role-play or storytelling [11] to simulate complex scenarios that may induce non-compliance, allowing for the evaluation of more nuanced policy violations.\nThe module is configurable, enabling users to adjust the proportion of direct and deceptive prompts to suit different evaluation contexts."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Compliance Assessment", "content": "The Compliance Assessment module evaluates responses using the LLM-as-a-judge technique, leveraging the GPT-40 API to determine whether each response adheres to the specified policy. For each prompt-response pair (duet), the module provides a detailed evaluation in JSON format, including an explanation of the decision. Compliance is determined at two levels: fine-grained evaluations for individual responses and an overall compliance result for the entire GPT. Importantly, non-compliance is flagged if any response violates the policy, whereas compliance requires all responses to adhere. The inclusion of rationales enhances interpretability and facilitates validation, while also providing actionable insights for further analysis."}, {"title": "2.2.4 Orchestrator", "content": "The Orchestrator oversees the coordination and execution of all modules.

The Orchestrator also maintains a comprehensive log of evaluations, allowing the process to resume seamlessly in case of disruptions."}, {"title": "3 Validation", "content": "This section details the validation process undertaken to ensure the framework's reliability, robustness, and correctness. The validation comprised three key stages: Annotator Agreement, Compliance Assessment Performance, and System-level Testing under various operational scenarios."}, {"title": "3.1 Annotator Agreement", "content": "The validation of the Compliance Assessment module involved manual annotation to establish a ground truth against which automated evaluations could be compared. To generate this ground truth, three co-authors independently annotated a randomly selected set of 16 prompt-response pairs, sampled from the evaluation of eight Custom GPTs spanning three categories: Romantic GPTs, Cybersecurity GPTs, and Academic GPTs. These categories were chosen for their relevance to the evaluated policies and their alignment with the annotators' expertise (Academic and Cybersecurity), as well as the relative ease of evaluating Romantic GPTs.\nDuring the annotation process, it became evident that the brevity and ambiguity of OpenAI's usage policies led to subjective interpretations and inconsistent judgments. To address this, the policies were expanded and clarified using ChatGPT running GPT-40, which was instructed to elaborate, provide detailed explanations, and include examples for each policy. This approach leveraged the assumption that ChatGPT\u2014as a product of OpenAI-would be the most plausible proxy for the company's intended compliance perspective. The original and extended policies are presented in Table 1.\nThe expanded policies improved annotation clarity while highlighting a notable contrast in the ease of evaluating different types of prompts. Direct prompts often contain explicit requests that are easily identifiable as compliant or non-compliant based on the policies. For instance, a direct prompt might explicitly ask a Custom GPT to provide answers to an academic exam. In such cases, responses are typically straightforward to evaluate, as compliance depends on whether the GPT refrains from directly completing the exam task and instead provides ethical and educational guidance. This clarity allows annotators to make definitive compliance determinations with high agreement.\nIn contrast, deceptive prompts are intentionally framed to obfuscate intent, frequently presenting scenarios as hypothetical or educational. For example, a deceptive prompt might inquire about methods for cheating on exams under the guise"}, {"title": "3.2 Compliance Assessment Performance", "content": "This stage evaluated the Compliance Assessment module by comparing its outputs to the manually annotated ground truth. Following the establishment of sufficient agreement, one annotator proceeded to annotate an additional 32 direct prompt-response pairs-reaching a total of 40-sampled from eight Custom GPTs spanning the same categories.\nThe 40 annotated pairs were then processed by the module, and its outputs were systematically compared with the ground truth. The evaluation\u00b2 demonstrated high reliability, with the module achieving a precision of 0.976, and accuracy, recall and F1 score of 0.975. These results confirm the module's capacity to accurately identify policy violations.\nThese results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in accurately identifying policy violations through automated evaluation, directly addressing RQ1: \u201cHow can Custom GPTs in the GPT store be automatically evaluated for compliance with OpenAI's usage policies?\""}, {"title": "3.3 System Testing", "content": "To ensure the framework's operational reliability, a series of tests were conducted on individual modules as well as the system as a whole. These tests included load testing, end-to-end evaluations, and stress tests under simulated failure conditions.\nThe Red-Teaming Prompts Generator was evaluated iteratively, refining the input prompts used to generate evaluation queries. The process validated the distinction between direct and deceptive prompts, ensuring the clarity and relevance of generated queries. The generator's configurability was also tested, confirming its ability to adjust the ratio of direct to deceptive prompts based on specific evaluation requirements.\nThe Compliance Assessment module was subjected to additional testing to validate the format and completeness of its JSON outputs, which include evaluations for each prompt-response pair, compliance rationales, and overall determinations for each Custom GPT. These tests confirmed the module's ability to process a high volume of pairs without errors, consistently generating all required fields.\nFinally, system-level testing focused on the resilience of the framework during high-demand scenarios. Particular attention was given to rate limits imposed by the GPT store (e.g., a limit of 50 messages per three hours for paid users). The framework dynamically detected these limits, paused operations as required, and resumed them once restrictions were lifted. Tests also addressed backend errors, such as incomplete responses or connectivity issues, verifying the framework's ability to handle such failures gracefully. In all cases, the system was able to resume evaluations from the last successfully processed GPT, ensuring continuity and preserving the integrity of results."}, {"title": "4 Large-Scale Evaluation of Custom GPTs", "content": "The primary goal of this experiment is to demonstrate the framework's ability to evaluate large sets of Custom GPTS and to provide insights into their compliance with OpenAI's usage policies.

Of these, 19 were excluded due to missing descriptions, a requirement for generating tailored red-teaming prompts. An additional 20 were excluded due to operational issues: 13 encountered backend errors, and 7 failed to return complete compliance evaluations. Ultimately, 782 Custom GPTs were successfully evaluated, and their results are summarized below.\nFigure 4 provides an overview of the evaluated GPTs, highlighting their distribution across the three primary categories and their popularity based on the number of recorded chats in the GPT store. Most GPTs recorded fewer than 1,000 chats, indicating limited usage, while a small subset exceeded 100,000 chats, reflecting significant user engagement. The figure also shows user ratings, which tend to cluster between 4.0 and 4.5, suggesting generally positive feedback from users.\nThe evaluation results indicate that 323 GPTs (41.3%) were classified as compliant, while 459 (58.7%) exhibited potential policy violations. However, compliance rates varied significantly across categories. As shown in Figure 4, Romantic GPTs demonstrated the highest rate of non-compliance at 98.0%, while Cybersecurity GPTs exhibited the lowest rate at 7.4%. Approximately two-thirds of Academic GPTs were classified as non-compliant. These findings underscore the variation in compliance challenges across thematic categories.\nThis analysis directly addresses RQ2: What is the overall compliance of Custom GPTs in the GPT store, and what patterns of non-compliance can be observed at scale? By examining the compliance distribution and identifying thematic variations, we provide insights into systemic challenges faced by different categories of Custom GPTs."}, {"title": "4.3 Popularity Correlation Analyses", "content": "To explore whether a GPT's popularity (measured by the number of chats) correlates with its compliance status, we conducted statistical analyses using three methods: the Mann-Whitney U Test, Logistic Regression, and Point-Biserial Correlation. A summary of the results is presented in Table 2.\nThe Mann-Whitney U Test revealed statistically significant differences in the number of chats between compliant and non-compliant GPTs (p < 0.05; p = 0.0168). However, both Logistic Regression and Point-Biserial Correlation indicated a weak and statistically insignificant relationship between chat counts and compliance.\nThese findings suggest that while the overall distribution of chats may differ between compliant and non-compliant GPTs, this difference does not reflect a causal or meaningful correlation. External factors, such as data variability or the influence of outliers, may account for the observed differences in chat distributions rather than any inherent link between popularity and compliance."}, {"title": "5 Case Studies and Patterns of Policy Violations", "content": "This section examines specific patterns of policy violations identified among the Custom GPTs flagged as non-compliant during our large-scale evaluation.

The widespread adoption of such systems reflects their perceived utility by users, yet also underscores their potential societal impact. Notably, eight of the ten most popular non-compliant GPTs in our dataset belong to this category, while the remaining two are classified under Cybersecurity.\nTo investigate academic dishonesty within this category, the Red-Teaming Prompts Generator module analyzed whether Custom GPTs were predisposed to completing academic tasks for users, effectively facilitating cheating.

The disclosure process involved sending an email to OpenAI that included detailed documentation of non-compliant behavior, examples of interactions, and relevant findings from our analysis. OpenAI responded five days later with an (apparently AI-generated) reply expressing interest in the technique used, thanking us for the communication, and directing us to report each identified Custom GPT manually through a publicly available online form.\nFollowing this correspondence, we monitored the status of the disclosed Custom GPTs on the GPT store over the subsequent two weeks. After that time, seven of the custom GPTs reported were removed from the platform. These included GPTs designed for purposes such as providing sexual guidance for teenagers, simulating romantic partners, facilitating academic cheating, generating research articles, or enabling black-hat hacking activities.\nOur findings reveal systemic challenges in ensuring compliance within the GPT store. First, the reliance on user-driven reporting mechanisms for non-compliance introduces inefficiencies and may hinder timely action against harmful or non-compliant GPTs. Second, the observed alignment between non-compliance in Custom GPTs and inherited behaviors from base models further complicates efforts to enforce platform policies. Developers face inherent challenges in adhering to policies when foundational models exhibit the same issues, effectively reducing their ability to produce compliant Custom GPTs.\nFinally, our analysis suggests that certain non-compliant GPTs, particularly in the Romantic category, appear to be intentionally designed to bypass OpenAI's usage policies. For example, Romantic GPTs frequently include tailored responses to foster emotional attachment or intimacy, directly contravening platform guidelines. This raises broader questions about the effectiveness of current review mechanisms and underscores the need for better approaches to foster compliance enforcement."}, {"title": "7 Discussion", "content": "Compliance of customized chatbots is predominantly steered by foundational models. A significant challenge highlighted by our findings is the issue of inherited behaviors from base models, such as GPT-4. Non-compliance observed in Custom GPTs often stems from these foundational models rather than user-driven customization, complicating efforts to enforce policy adherence. This attribution complexity raises critical questions: when a Custom GPT violates a policy, is the root cause embedded in the behavior of the base model, or does customization play a significant role? Given that most customizations are stylistic and do not substantively alter the core behavior of the model, developers face inherent challenges in ensuring compliance when foundational models themselves fail to align with platform policies."}, {"title": "8 Limitations", "content": "The determination of compliance for Custom GPTs is inherently influenced by the usage policies employed as the evaluation standard.

Extending the"}, {"title": "9 Related Work", "content": "The versatility of tasks and responses enabled by LLMs comes with inherent challenges in controlling their outputs and ensuring alignment with predefined guidelines. Prior research has highlighted several risks stemming from these limitations, including the generation of malware and phishing messages [12], the dissemination of misinformation and fake news [13, 14], and the creation of malicious bots [12, 15]. Additionally, LLMs face technical shortcomings such as hallucinations\u2014wherein they produce incorrect or nonsensical information [16]\u2014and code injection vulnerabilities, which adversaries can exploit to manipulate LLMs, leading to unintended and potentially harmful outputs [16].\nThese challenges are rooted in the inherent complexity of LLMs. Their black-box nature and intricate internal mechanisms make it difficult to predict and control their behavior under diverse user inputs, exacerbating the challenges of safeguarding them [17, 18]. Moreover, the widespread adoption of LLMs among non-specialized users amplifies the need for robust safety considerations. Striking a balance between training LLMs to be helpful and ensuring their safety remains an ongoing challenge. Excessive focus on helpfulness can lead to harmful content generation, whereas overly restrictive safety tuning risks rejecting legitimate prompts and negatively affecting utility [19, 20]. OpenAI has invested significant resources into addressing these challenges [21], employing security policies, conducting both manual and automated evaluations, and implementing dedicated red-teaming efforts to mitigate risks [22].\nTo further advance safety evaluations, open datasets have been developed to systematically assess LLMs, as documented in a recent systematic review [23]. This review underscores gaps in the ecosystem, including the predominance of English-centric datasets and the limitations of existing benchmarks in comprehensively assessing safety dimensions. Building on this, researchers have proposed various frameworks and benchmarks for safety evaluations. For instance, Xie et al. [24] developed a public dataset for evaluating LLMs using black-box, white-box, and gray-box approaches. Another benchmark expands the scope of safety evaluation to 45 distinct categories, analyzing 40 models and identifying Claude-2 and Gemini-1.5 as the most robust in terms of safety [25]. Additional benchmarks offer larger prompt sets for evaluation [26], as well as support for multilingual assessments in languages such as English and Chinese [27, 28].\nThe LLM-as-a-judge technique has also emerged as a widely adopted method for evaluating LLM outputs [29, 30, 31]. This approach, which involves using LLMs to assess the quality or performance of other systems, has demonstrated high agreement rates with human evaluations, further validating its efficacy [32].\nThe customization of LLMs introduces another dimension of complexity to their safety assessment. Hung et al. [33] proposed a method demonstrating that fine-tuning can enhance safety by reducing harmful outputs while maintaining task accuracy. Conversely, other studies have shown that fine-tuning can inadvertently degrade safety alignment, even when benign datasets are used, rendering models more vulnerable to harmful or adversarial instructions [34]. Additionally, fine-tuning has been linked to increased susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks [35], and when applied to develop agent applications, it can lead to unintended safety lapses if failed interaction data is not properly utilized [36]. Achieving a balance between safety and utility is essential, as an excessive emphasis on safety during fine-tuning may cause models to overly reject valid prompts, negatively impacting their usability [37].\nOpenAI's Custom GPTs represent a significant advancement in enabling end-users to personalize LLMs. Prior studies have noted that some features of these systems may introduce significant security risks [38], including security and privacy concerns within the GPT store [39]. Zhang et al. [40] conducted the first longitudinal study of the platform, analyzing metadata from 10,000 Custom GPTs and identifying a growing interest in these systems. Similarly, Su et al. [41] examined the GPT store, analyzing user preferences, algorithmic influences, and market dynamics.

Our results reveal that 58.7% of analyzed GPTs exhibit potential policy violations, highlighting significant gaps in the current publication and review process of the GPT store.

This indicates that foundational models still require improvements to better align with OpenAI's usage policies while maintaining their versatility and utility.\nOur framework, validated with an F1 score of 0.975, provides a robust tool for large-scale, systematic policy compliance evaluation. Given its scalability and effectiveness, we propose its integration into OpenAI's review process at the time of publication of Custom GPTs in the GPT store. This addition would enhance the oversight of model compliance, reducing the prevalence of unsafe or non-compliant deployments.\nAs future work, we aim to extend the validation of our framework to include experts in a broader range of usage policies and application domains, such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. While deceptive prompts were excluded from the large-scale evaluations due to challenges in annotator agreement, they hold significant potential to enhance compliance detection in complex scenarios. Future efforts will focus on refining these prompts and achieving consistent annotations, enabling their integration into the framework alongside direct prompts.

{"title": "The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework: An Introduction", "authors": ["Kari D. Weaver"], "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools - particularly generative artificial intelligence based in large language models - are becoming widely available, their use across the varied contexts of education, work, and research must be negotiated. The accelerating uptake of these tools is driving a range of conversations around transparency in the use of these tools for various purposes.", "sections": [{"title": null, "content": "Within the contexts of education and research, and particularly within higher education, the citation has long been the standard tool for providing transparency and connection in the transfer of ideas across scholars, framing of arguments, and design of methodologies.\nAccordingly, as Al tools have grown in prominence, organizations that publish style manuals and guides have provided citation guidance to address the use of Al-generated content to inform education and research practice. The ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education reinforces this practice through the themes Information Creation as a Process and Scholarship as Conversation which directly address citation practices as an element of information literacy."}, {"title": null, "content": "Unfortunately, citations do not fully meet the needs of today's Al-enabled world. Citations emphasize the fixed form of a tangible output. This is incongruent with today's generative Al systems, where the specific interplay of prompt, model, and model parameters create a unique output that is not always repeatable, reproducible, or recallable, depending on the technology. Citations also focus on the ideas posed by an author, whereas generative Al can serve a variety of meaningful functions in the writing process, including researcher, editor, critic, collaborator, and more. While today's citation practices do help provide some transparency, they are not sufficient, in and of themselves, to capture the varied ways in which Al tools function or are being used across contexts."}, {"title": null, "content": "In response, there have been burgeoning conversations and recommendations around the need to attribute the use of Al in research. Thus far, this need has been met via the recommended inclusion of a note, with little to no guidance on what the note itself should include. This has been identified as a problem to the use of Al in academic and research contexts. Calls for greater transparency and granularity in the use of Al abound."}, {"title": null, "content": "Despite the growing calls for increased transparency, a gap currently exists across all contexts regarding how and to what level of detail disclosure of Al tools require. While this is a particular issue within the research community, where the authors are still to be held firmly to account for their work, it relates back to academic integrity concerns within education and has implications for student assessment and instructional practice."}, {"title": null, "content": "In the service of addressing this gap, across all of those varied contexts, I would like to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework. The AID Framework was inspired by the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) developed in 2012 through a"}, {"title": null, "content": "collaborative workshop hosted by the Wellcome Trust and Harvard University. The purpose of a CRediT statement is to outline contributors' individual roles as authors within a research output. The AID Framework adapts this concept to the use of artificial intelligence."}, {"title": null, "content": "My approach to the AID framework is grounded in my own professional work as an academic librarian, my experiences as a scholar and educator, and my engagement as a member of the University of Waterloo's Associate Vice-President Academic's Standing Committee on New Technologies, Pedagogy, and Academic Integrity. It is meant to provide transparency to the use of artificial intelligence tools throughout the writing process, ensuring clarity at a level that is both detailed enough to be informative and short enough to avoid being onerous. While the specific taxonomy described below is targeted toward academic and research use, it can easily be adapted to other contexts and workflows where disclosure of Al use is important."}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework\u00b9", "content": "The purpose of the Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework is to provide brief, targeted disclosure about the use of Al systems based on the range of activities used for research writing. The AID Statement is appended to the end of the paper (similar to an Acknowledgements section), detailing the Al tools used and the manner in which they were used, based on the possible points of engagement through the writing process, as captured in the headings below. The formatting is intended to be both human- and machine-readable, and uses the following structure:\nAID Statement: Artificial Intelligence Tool: [description of tools used]; [Heading]: [description of Al use in that stage of the work];...\nEach heading: statement pair will end in a semi-colon, except for the last statement, which will end in a period. Any other symbols can be used in \u201cstatement\" portion of the heading: statement pair except for colons and semi-colons.\nIf Al tools were used at any point in the writing, research, or project management processes, the AID Statement will always begin with the \u201cartificial intelligence tool\u201d section. It will then be followed by any heading: statement pairs necessary to disclose Al tool use. Heading: statement pairs will only be included if Al was used in that portion of the writing process. If a heading is not needed, it should not be included. If Al was not used at any point in the writing, research, or project management processes, authors would not include an AID Statement in their work.\nThe potential headings for the AID Statement, and their definitions, are the following:\nArtificial Intelligence Tool(s): The selection of tool or tools and versions of those tools used and dates of use. May also include note of any known biases or limitations of the models or data sets.\nConceptualization: The development of the research idea or hypothesis including framing or revision of research questions and hypotheses."}, {"title": null, "content": "Methodology: The planning for the execution of the study including all direct contributions to the study design.\nInformation Collection: The use of artificial intelligence to surface patterns in existing literature and identify information relevant to the framing, development, or design of the study.\nData Collection Method: The development or design of software or instruments used in the study.\nExecution: The direct conduct of research procedures or tasks (e.g. Al web scraping, synthetic surveys, etc.)\nData Curation: The management and organization of those data.\nData Analysis: The performance of statistical or mathematical analysis, regressions, text analysis, and more using artificial intelligence tools.\nPrivacy and Security: The ways in which data privacy and security were upheld in alignment with the expectations of ethical conduct of research, disciplinary guidelines, and institutional policies.\nInterpretation: The use of artificial intelligence tools to categorize, summarize, or manipulate data and suggest associated conclusions.\nVisualization: The creation of visualizations or other graphical representations of the data.\nWriting \u2013 Review & Editing: The revision and editing of the manuscript.\nWriting \u2013 Translation: The use of artificial intelligence to translate text across languages at any point in the drafting process.\nProject Administration: Any administrative tasks related to the study, including managing budgets, timelines, and communications."}, {"title": null, "content": "The following are examples of AID Statements and their usage for research and education."}, {"title": "For use in Research:", "content": "Researchers need detailed guidance to fully articulate the variety and depth of ways in which Al tools have been used throughout the research and publication processes.

Consequently, instructors may wish to incorporate an AID Statement directly within their instruction or assessment materials and can adapt an AID Statement for use in a course syllabus or learning management system."}, {"title": "Conclusion:", "content": "The AID Framework provides a method for transparency of Al use in writing that is clear, consistent, succinct, and amenable to both human and machine use. It can also be adapted to a range of other contexts where there are consistent and enable Al use at multiple points in a workflow. While Al is a fast-developing field, with growing capabilities, this structured approach allows us to do our best work faster and more efficiently without losing sight of the critical human additions. Finally, adopting a consistent approach to artificial intelligence disclosure through the AID Framework simplifies the expectations and needed elements to maintain academic and research ethics."}]}

Yu"], "abstract": "The use of trajectory data with abundant spatial- temporal information is pivotal in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and various traffic system tasks. Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the increasing popularity of GPS-embedded devices, data collection, and data mining technologies, a vast amount of trajectory data has been generated [1]. This data is widely utilized in various domains, including travel time prediction [2] and location-based services [3]. These applications serve as crucial components in enabling the adaptive development of ITS. However, the collection of trajectory data raises significant privacy concerns as it may contain sensitive information about users' daily lives [4]. If the data is not adequately protected, it can be susceptible to misuse and unauthorized access, potentially leading to privacy breaches and harm to individuals. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the protection of users' privacy when utilizing such data.\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in the development of privacy-preserving methods for GPS trajectory data.\n[5] propose a method based on the K-Anonymity technique to generate new trajectory data from real datasets. Additionally, Differential Privacy (DP), introduced by [6], has been utilized to protect against possible attacks by applying Laplace Noise to location data. However, these methods often modify trajectory data, which could introduce bias and compromise the integrity of the entire database. Therefore, it is important to balance privacy preservation and data utility. To achieve this, we turn to machine learning methods that are efficient in extracting the features of the dataset. It is assumed that the dataset is generated from underlying latent space so that models can capture the latent representation of the dataset. Therefore, we need a generative model that approximates the data probability distribution by Bayesian inference as well as generating an entirely new dataset. Thus, the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) model is proposed to generate a new dataset with a similar feature space and data distribution compared with the original dataset. Besides, Federated learning (FL) provides a way to maintain user privacy in centralized data settings for deep learning models. The training process occurs locally on devices or edge servers, allowing the model to learn from decentralized data without sending individual data to a central server. This approach strikes a balance between utilizing valuable data for model training and preserving user privacy, making it a promising framework for privacy- preserving deep learning in real-world applications [7].\nIn this paper, we address the privacy-preserving task for trajectory datasets by employing the federated learning approach alongside trajectory generation methods. To contextualize our research, we comprehensively review and compare existing privacy-preserving methods specifically tailored for trajectory datasets. We also explore various trajectory data generation approaches and delve into the realm of federated learning, providing a crucial foundation for the subsequent methodology introduction. We take advantage of the FL framework and VAE model to propose a novel methodology, Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE), for generating new trajectory data based on actual data while preserving user privacy. We evaluate our approach in both privacy and utility metrics. Especially, our approach is evaluated in a practical downstream task, namely, traffic mode identification (TMI), to demonstrate its utility. The experimental results showcase the exceptional data utility of the generated dataset while maintaining user location privacy. The workflow of the proposed theme is illustrated"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Over the past few decades, researchers have proposed vari- ous approaches to address the challenge of preserving location privacy in LBS. These approaches can be broadly classified into two main architectures: centralized and non-centralized. In a centralized architecture, a centralized entity is employed to protect location privacy. The most widely used method is K-anonymity [8], which ensures that each data point is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other data points [9], [10]. It is commonly applied in sensitive databases to prevent the identification of unique users through queries. On the other hand, non-centralized architectures include obfuscation-based methods, such as introducing perturbations into collected or quantizing locations [6], as well as cryptographic-based meth- ods [11]. However, these approaches have their drawbacks. For example, finding a trusted third party for centralized methods and cryptographic-based methods [11] is a challenging task. Besides, obfuscation-based methods can be vulnerable to background knowledge attacks [12], where attackers can apply additional information to de-anonymize users.\nTo summarize, previous methods for preserving privacy in trajectory data overlooked semantic information, resulting in a loss of dataset utility. Additionally, approaches involving cryp- tographic or clustering operations are unsuitable for handling sparse and large datasets. Hence, a trajectory generation-based method is proposed using a VAE model, maintaining the origi- nal feature space and producing new data. In line with real-life scenarios, FL is applied to the training process, ensuring users' data is kept locally and not exposed to other devices, thus protecting users' privacy and improving operational efficiency."}, {"title": "B. Trajectory generation", "content": "Trajectory generation methods are utilized to enhance the feature space in sparse data or reduce noise in noisy datasets, making the data more informative and useful for subsequent tasks. There are several methods for generating trajectory data. [13] generates new trajectory data by space discretization and synthesis according to mobility patterns and movable constraints. [14], [15] use machine learning to generate a new dataset from the original dataset. However, they are unsuitable for our goal of maintaining the original feature space, which is important in subsequent tasks. Besides, training GAN-based models can be challenging due to gradient vanishing and explosion issues. Therefore, we turn to VAE-based models, generally used for data augmentation [16]. They focus on both reconstruction and distribution loss, making them effective for data generation."}, {"title": "C. Federated Learning", "content": "In the conventional machine learning paradigm, data is typically sent to central servers for training. However, this raises concerns about privacy and data security. To address these concerns, FL has emerged as a solution to facilitate com- munication between local clients and central servers without transferring the original data [17]. The key idea is that the clients contribute to the model training process by uploading their local updates of the model's gradients to the servers instead of sharing raw data. Then these updates are aggregated on the servers to create a comprehensive model. This approach ensures the privacy and security of the data, as the raw data remains on the client's local devices.\nIn the context of FL, a commonly used approach is federated averaging (FedAVG) [18]. In FedAVG, the locally trained models are weighted according to the size of the respective"}, {"title": "IV.

Local VAE Model for Trajectory Generation", "content": "We propose a VAE model for generating new trajectory data in the local clients, as illustrated in Figure 2. It consists of two fundamental components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder module aims to capture the underlying latent representation of the input data (i.e., GPS trajectory and travel mode labels). In contrast, the decoder module focuses on generating synthetic data that aligns with the distribution of the original training data from the latent vector.\n1) Encoder module: Given a collection of GPS trajectories, we first pass them into Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)- based layers to capture the sequential features. Additionally, linear layers are employed to incorporate auxiliary features such as traffic modes and related attributes into the model. The resulting encoder produces a latent representation $z$, which is further transformed via a non-linear function to produce a probability distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$ over the latent space. Subsequently, a set of generative latent vectors is sampled from the distribution and passed into the decoder module to generate synthetic trajectory data.\nHowever, directly computing the probability distribution $p_{\\theta}(x)$ is computationally challenging due to its complexity. To overcome this issue, Bayesian inference is employed by incorporating a prior distribution $p_{\\phi}(z)$ and the true posterior"}, {"title": "V.

Dataset", "content": "We employ Microsoft's Geolife dataset [24], [25] for our experiment, which is extensively utilized for traffic mode identification [26]. The dataset comprises both labeled and unlabeled data, collected from a total of 182 users, including 69 users with labeled data and 113 users with unlabeled data. For five years, the users record their traffic mode data in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) points and timestamps, along with the corresponding traffic mode, which encompasses activities such as walking, biking, and bus transit.\nMoreover, the collection of raw data from users varies in length, thus requiring pre-processing steps such as cutting and padding. According to the Geolife dataset, we divide each tra- jectory into sub-sequences of length 100, which is a reasonable length that contains enough traffic mode information, and pads shorter sequences with zeros. Additionally, a mask matrix is constructed to record padded segments and distinguish valid and invalid parts for loss computation by binary values. For unpadded segments, the mask is a sequence of ones with a length of 100."}, {"title": "B.

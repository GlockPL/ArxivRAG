{"title": "Engaging with Children's Artwork in Mixed Visual-Ability Families", "authors": ["Arnavi Chheda-Kothary", "Jacob O. Wobbrock", "Jon E. Froehlich"], "abstract": "We present two studies exploring how blind or low-vision (BLV) family members engage with their sighted children's artwork, strategies to support understanding and interpretation, and the potential role of technology, such as AI, therein. Our first study involved 14 BLV individuals, and the second included five groups of BLV individuals with their children. Through semi-structured interviews with AI descriptions of children's artwork and multi-sensory design probes, we found that BLV family members value artwork engagement as a bonding opportunity, preferring the child's storytelling and interpretation over other nonvisual representations. Additionally, despite some inaccuracies, BLV family members felt that AI-generated descriptions could facilitate dialogue with their children and aid self-guided art discovery. We close with specific design considerations for supporting artwork engagement in mixed visual-ability families, including enabling artwork access through various methods, supporting children's corrections of AI output, and distinctions in context vs. content and interpretation vs. description of children's artwork.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artistic creation is intrinsic to childhood. Through art, children creatively express themselves, impacting happiness, social skills, intellectual development, and confidence [6, 47, 57]. To support the joy and creativity that artistic expression fosters in children, it is important that parents and relatives engage with their children's artwork [5]. Art-based interactions between parents and children, such as co-creating artwork or participating in art therapy, also enable deeper parent-child closeness [3] and positively affect children's perceptions of acceptance [4]. While the importance of artistic creation and art-based interactions between child and parent is well-established, there are open questions about how blind or low-vision (BLV) parents and relatives engage with their sighted children's artwork, such as how they perceive visual art creations, provide encouragement and feedback, and what, if any, tools and techniques they might use to help them explore their children's creative output.\nAlthough recent research and technology advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital fabrication (3-D printers, laser cutters) have explored nonvisual access to visual artifacts, including BLV-accessible art creation tools [46], tactile representations of professional artwork [26, 35], and AI-based applications for image descriptions [12, 14], a gap remains in our understanding of how BLV family members engage with visual creations made by their children. In this work, we explore: (1) How do BLV family members currently engage with their children's artwork? (2) What information about their children's artwork do BLV family members want to have available? (3) How can BLV family members use technology to enhance engagement with their children's artwork?\nTo investigate these questions, we conducted two semi-structured interview studies. In Study 1, we recruited 14 BLV family members and asked questions about current strategies to support understanding and interpretation of their children's artwork, motivations for and barriers to doing so, and their use of technology in aiding comprehension. For Study 2, we recruited a subset of BLV family members from Study 1 with their children; here our focus was on the child, the child's process of creating and sharing art, and the child-adult interaction. Both studies gathered feedback about AI interpretations of their children's artwork using two state-of-the-art tools: Be My AI [12] and ChatGPT4 [10]. The second study also utilized design probes with two in-person relative-and-child groups to explore non-visual art representations preferences. Interview sessions were recorded, transcribed, and then iteratively coded to reach a set of themes concerning current practices and underlying motivations, desired information about artwork, and responses to actual or potential technology."}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "Our work builds on prior research in non-visual representations of artwork and images, the emerging role of AI, and how technology supports mixed-ability interactions."}, {"title": "2.1 Nonvisual Representation of Art and Images", "content": "There is a rich history of work in human-computer interaction (HCI) investigating nonvisual representations of art and images for blind and low-vision (BLV) people [9, 22, 31, 42, 48, 50, 61, 65]. In the digital realm, BLV people primarily interpret images through access technology such as screen readers, which read human- or AI- generated alternative text descriptions (ALT text) [9, 22, 50]. Several commercial applications, including Be My Eyes [15] and Seeing AI [14], provide human or AI description services for live scenes as well as images.\nResearchers have increasingly explored alternate modalities to represent images and graphics, including touchscreen-based image interactions [44, 51], tactile representations [27], electrotactile feedback [40], vibrofeedback [37], sonification [36], and multimodal systems [39, 59, 63]. Tactile graphics creation techniques include 3D printing [60], swell touch paper [35], laser cutting [26, 35], refreshable tactile displays [8], and do-it-yourself (DIY) strategies [68]. Touchscreens afford direct spatial input via touch and audio output, but lack tactility. Tactile representations offer high tactility but can be more challenging to produce, and static, rather than dynamic."}, {"title": "2.2 AI as a Tool for BLV People", "content": "With recent advances in generative AI (GAI), new AI-powered BLV tools have emerged such as Be My AI [12], a GPT-backed [10] system available through Be My Eyes; OKO [7], a navigation application for pedestrian safety that also uses GPT; and AI advancements in screen readers such as JAWS [17] for improved picture interpretation.\nResearch by Gonzalez et al. [34] explores BLV people's usage and trust of AI tools to describe visual content. Through a diary study, they identify ways to improve AI descriptions to increase trustworthiness to BLV people. Huh et al. [38] leverage different Al models to unlock a more accessible experience for the BLV community when creating and vetting AI-generated images. Glazko et al. [33] report on self-usage of GAI tools; a BLV researcher on the team talked through pros and cons of using GAI to write code and vet generated user interface layouts. However, the effects of the latest advances in GAI have not yet been evaluated in the context of mixed visual-ability families. Additionally, there is scant understanding of how these Al tools perform on diverse types of children's drawings."}, {"title": "2.3 Supporting Mixed-Ability Groups", "content": "A mixed-ability group is any group with some members having a disability and others not [64]. We draw upon prior research investigating technology in mixed-ability spaces for our work in mixed visual-ability families. For example, Phutane et al. [54] investigate tactile materials by teachers of BLV students, highlighting how tactile as a medium can be used for communicating visual concepts in mixed visual-ability settings. Branham and Kane employ semi-structured interviews and field studies as qualitative methods to examine how blind and sighted companions co-create accessible home spaces [23] and how blind employees navigate mixed-ability workplaces [24]; our studies are methodologically similar, as we interview both the BLV adult and their sighted collaborator (in our work's case, their children) to understand collective perspectives on artwork sharing. Artifacts showing potential for technology in mixed-ability settings include dual interfaces that fuse visual and nonvisual interactions by Savidis and Stephanidis [58], a multimodal handwriting-learning environment for BLV students and their teachers by Plimmer et al. [55], and a prompter system by Carmien [28] supporting young adults with cognitive disabilities and their caregivers. Moreover, research in mixed-ability family settings includes work by Storer and Branham [64], Park et al. [53], and Cassidy et al. [29], who explore the design of technology for co-reading interactions between BLV parents and their children, approaching the BLV parent's perspective through observational and interview studies like we do in our work. However, prior research has not investigated technology in mixed visual-ability families' interactions around children's artwork."}, {"title": "3 STUDY 1: INTERVIEWS WITH BLV ADULTS", "content": "To explore how blind and low-vision (BLV) family members' and their sighted children engage with child-created art and strategies to support understanding and interpretation, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 14 BLV adult participants (Study 1). We then conducted a complementary study (Study 2) with five BLV family members and their children to gain an understanding of the child's perspective, to directly observe responses to AI and tactile interpretations of their work, and to examine cross-generational dynamics. We report on Study 1 below."}, {"title": "3.1 Participants", "content": "We recruited 14 BLV family members of sighted children, including both parents and non-parent relatives (e.g., grandparents) through email lists, social media posts, and snowball sampling [2]. All family members were 18 years of age or older. Participants were located throughout the United States and had the option of participating virtually through Zoom, over the phone, or in person."}, {"title": "3.2 Procedure", "content": "Study 1 consisted of three parts: (1) a pre-study questionnaire, filled out prior to the session starting, (2) a semi-structured interview, and (3) a demonstration and discussion of AI-based descriptions of children's artwork. Sessions lasted for 60 minutes. All participants were compensated $25.\nThe pre-study questionnaire collected demographics as well as information about vision loss and their children's art. For the semi-structured interview, we asked questions about how participants currently engage with their children's artwork, their motivations and desires to learn about the art and art process, and the tools and techniques they use to understand and interpret the art.\nTo examine the potential for Al as an access tool for children's artwork, we invited participants to share their child-created art pieces. At the end of the study, we inputted these images into two state-of-the-art AI tools, Be My AI [12] and ChatGPT4 (i.e., ChatGPT using GPT-4) [10], and shared the AI output with participants. We solicited reactions to the AI descriptions, feelings about using AI to learn about their children's art, and potential opportunities and concerns."}, {"title": "3.3 Analysis", "content": "All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. For analysis, we used deductive and inductive coding [1], drawing on our interview protocol for deductive codes and affinity diagramming [25, 41] of transcripts for inductive codes, thereby arriving at our initial codebook. The first author then engaged in peer debriefing [52] with another researcher (who was given two transcripts and the codebook) to iterate on the codes. Both researchers met to resolve disagreements, updated the codebook, and the first author then re-analyzed all transcripts with the final codes."}, {"title": "4 STUDY 1 FINDINGS", "content": "We report on how blind or low-vision (BLV) family members engage with their children's artwork, their motivations and concerns, and strategies for understanding and interpretation-from conversations with the child to the use of technology and AI. Throughout, we highlight the emotional and intimate connection between the child and adult that is often cultivated through art. Quotes have been lightly edited for grammar, concision, and anonymity."}, {"title": "4.1 Current Practices", "content": "We identified five common approaches for how BLV family members engage with their children's artwork, including: most commonly, talking with the child about the artwork (N=14/14) or asking a sighted adult partner (N=10); other sensory approaches, such as having the child guide their hand to trace outlines (N=4) or using tactile materials or other access adaptations (N=4); and, finally, using technology tools (N=3) such as Seeing AI and Be My Eyes. For low-vision family members who retain some sight, a common technique was to take a picture of the art with their phone and zoom in to discern more detail (N=3).\nWhen first presented with an art piece, all participants mentioned inviting the child to describe their artwork verbally and then asked directed follow-up questions. As P1 described: \u201cThe trick is to say, 'Oh that's so nice. Tell me about it. And then they'll explain it. From that, you can ask some follow up questions like, \u2018Which was your favorite color you used?' By asking the questions, they tell the story.\u201d However, P9 and P10, both mothers, noted a balance between information seeking vs. feeling burdensome. P10 said: \u201cI am a blind mom, but that doesn't mean I monopolize all her time and energy to describe everything to my satisfaction.\u201d\nMany participants asked sighted friends or family as an alternate source of information (N=10). Some participants found it helpful to have \"adult\" vocabulary descriptions of artwork characteristics, and, accordingly, consulted with sighted adults for additional information. P4, a grandmother, recounted how her sighted husband describes their grandson's work to communicate his artistic growth:\nHowever, sighted friends or family do not always provide helpful descriptions for the BLV individual. For example, P3 and P10 discussed how art is subjective among adults as well, so they may not entirely capture what the child wanted to communicate. P3, an uncle, mentioned that he had experienced other adult relatives being unintentionally dismissive of children's drawings. P2, a father, had not sought help to describe his son's work because he did not want to seem mistrustful of his son's descriptions: \"I don't want to make him think I don't believe or understand what he's telling me. So I stick with [his descriptions] because I know he's trying his best to make sure I actually understand what he does.\"\nBeyond verbal descriptions. Participants also employed other senses to explore artwork, such as tactility, hand guiding, and even smell. P10's daughter outlined artwork in nail polish to create a raised line so she could \"feel the art.\" P7, a father, said his children often use tactile methods when creating art specifically for him: \"they'll do something in modeling clay, puff paint, Wikki Stix, string art, or something along those lines where I can actually feel it.\". P2, P4, P6, and P9 all mentioned hand guiding-their children would hold their hands to trace artwork outlines or guide their hands to a particular spot to co-create with them. Some approaches even went beyond tactility: P4 had her grandson use scented markers so she could smell the different colors they used in a drawing. Participants described their children organically adapting their artwork as they became aware of their BLV family member's disability. For example, P8, a great-grandmother, said her great-granddaughters remind each other to adapt their work: \"They're really good about saying, 'Oh, Nana can't see that. Get a black [felt pen] or do it in black ink.' Or [they say] 'that's too small. Make it bigger. Nana can't see it.' \"\nUse of interactive technology. When asked about their use of digital technology, a small subset (N=3) responded affirmatively. P11, a mother, tried Seeing AI; P3 connected with human volunteers through Be My Eyes; and P10 tried the AI feature of Be My Eyes called Be My Al. Both P10 and P11 described being underwhelmed by their Al experiences. P11 said the feedback she received \"This is a child's drawing\" was too simplistic and did not provide enough detail. P3 appreciated Be My Eyes because it allowed him to access an \"adult description\" of the artwork, such as if the drawing was done in portrait or landscape, point of view of the work, objects in the foreground vs. background, and more.\nFor those participants who had not used any technology to access their children's artwork (N=11), common reasons included: they had not thought to try it in this context (N=7), they did not use accessibility apps in their day-to-day lives (N=2), or it was easier to get sighted help (N=2). P4 mentioned one additional technology, the Echo Show, a home assistant with a display screen, which she used with her grandson to create artwork:"}, {"title": "4.2 Motivation for Engaging with Artwork", "content": "We also examined underlying motivations, concerns, and fears related to how BLV family members connect to and engage with children's artwork. Overall, participants emphasized the emotional and bonding value of exploring and understanding their child's artwork (N=14/14), how it enabled them to track developmental progress (N=4), and, for one family, how creative expression through art acted as a source of individual and collective healing. Concerning bonding, P6, a father, said:\nP3 echoed this sentiment of wanting children to feel satisfied with his response: \"If you appear standoff-ish, chances are they will not want to come back to you again with a new piece of artwork because they were not satisfied with your response in the first place.\u201d P4 and P10 both highlighted that artwork was a source of immense pride for their children, which is why it felt important for them to understand their art. P7 similarly described wanting to grow with his children's interests \u201cand show that I'm genuinely interested in what [they] like\". P2 discussed that, as a single father, he cultivates a family dynamic where he can \u201cengage in everything\u201d.\nAnother motivation, expressed by parents more than other relatives, was to use an understanding of artwork to evaluate their children's developmental progress. P12 has a son with Down syndrome\""}, {"title": "4.3 Preferences for Accessing Artwork", "content": "We asked what information BLV family members desire about their children's artwork and how they prefer to gain that information-and identified two interdependent response themes: (1) descriptive information such as color, medium, and object location, and (2) interpretive information, such as why the child created the art, their artistic choices, and what pieces of the art mean to the child. The distinction between gaining descriptive vs. interpretative information also corresponded to access preferences.\nAccess method preferences. All 14 participants valued children's verbal descriptions over any other approach because they centered the children's perspectives of their artwork, and allowed them to mix both description (e.g., colors used) and interpretation (e.g., why they used such colors and what they mean). Three of 14 adult participants emphasized that they do not need to know artwork traits beyond what their child wants to describe-and that there is so much more to art than the characteristics of the piece itself. As P12 expressed: \"Just listening to the enjoyment that he gets from sharing his artwork, even though it's not super descriptive... that's enough for me.\u201d Similarly, P11 emphasized understanding her child's intention behind his work as more important than knowing the exact visual output:"}, {"title": "4.4 Reactions to AI Tools", "content": "At the end of the study, we invited participants to share their children's artwork and analyzed them with two Al tools: Be My AI and ChatGPT4. Ten of our 14 participants had artwork available and took part in this portion of the study. In general, most participants (N=9) reacted positively but also discussed the lack of emotional depth, accuracy (e.g., discrepancies between the two AI descriptions), and how this technology could be used in the future.\nPotential benefits. Our participants identified several key benefits of using Al to analyze children artwork, including: the ability to discern details that were otherwise inaccessible (e.g., colors, painting techniques), access to information that could further conversation and connection with their child, and using AI to complement the child's description, particularly when they were not available (e.g., P10's former partner sends pictures of her daughter's work when her daughter is staying with him). As one poignant example, P7, a father, had taken his family on a trip to his alma mater university's football game. Some time later, his son made a drawing of the experience and shared it with his father; however, the father did not realize just how much was captured by the picture (Appendix, Figure 7), including details about the players and fans in the stands, until after hearing the AI description. P7 emotionally shared: \u201cHearing that [detailed Al description], I could have had a 10 minute conversation [with my son] and... appreciation for what he had done. It's dad guilt... I [originally] dismissed [the artwork]...\u201d.\nHere, P7 felt that having access to an Al description could have helped him better understand his child's artwork and his child's attempt to connect with him.\nP2 compared the AI description with his current practice of hand-guided tracing of his son's drawings: \u201cI get more information from it. Because [hand] tracing, it's fine. But with the Al, you actually give me whether the person [in the drawing] has something in their hand... How they dress, the facial features...\u201d. P2 liked the prospect of not needing to wait for his son's descriptions, and instead he could use time with his son to ask specific questions about the work after it has been described by the AI.\nP14 appreciated hearing descriptive qualities of the artwork, such as the colors and whether coloring was done \"inside the lines.\" Since she has many grandchildren, she was also excited about the possibility of using AI to identify who made the artwork.\nInterpretation vs. description. Similar to Section 4.3, tensions arose around Al providing descriptions about the artwork (e.g., color, medium, line thickness) and providing interpretation. Some participants (N=3) appreciated interpretation-such as inferring emotions on a drawn character's face (P2, P3)-others felt that the AI should avoid making inferences. For example, P9 disliked when the AI described one of the pictures drawn by her daughter as \"simple\". P12 described her irritation when the AI interpreted a green brushstroke in an abstract art piece as a tree or a plant (Figure 1c), saying:\nParticipants also felt the AI descriptions did not always capture intended emotions associated with some of the artwork. For example, when hearing the AI describe her great-granddaughter's picture (Figure 2), P8 said: \u201cI thought [the AI] missed the joy that she put into it. And I thought it missed the love.\u201d\nSimilarly, P5 reacted positively to descriptive elements of the AI analysis but not to the Al's interpretation (Figure 3):\nPerceptions of accuracy. Many participants seemed to understand the limits and imperfections of AI, and the use of two AI tools concurrently allowed for comparisons and more informed conversation about Al differences. Key concerns about Al accuracy included the potential for asking children about incorrect or nonexistent elements of their work (P12), fear of missing an important detail about the work (P10), and misunderstanding their child's work altogether (P5). However, some, like P7, seemed unfazed. We specifically noted that the AI miscounted the number of football players in his son's drawing, and the AI misread his son's name:"}, {"title": "5 STUDY 2: CHILDREN AND BLV FAMILY", "content": "To complement Study 1, we conducted a follow-up study with a subset of Study 1 participants along with their children (Table 1). Here, our goal was to focus on the child and their process of creating and sharing their art with the blind or low-vision (BLV) adult: how did the child think about their creations? Were their artistic choices, materials, or method of sharing influenced by a potential BLV audience? How did they feel about and react to AI interpretations of their work? We additionally wanted to observe the deliberate or implicit practices that occur when mixed visual-ability families connect over artwork and families' reactions to technological design probes representing artwork nonvisually."}, {"title": "5.1 Participants", "content": "Five BLV adults from Study 1 agreed to participate in Study 2 with their child: P6, P7, P8, P9, and P14. For each session, the number of children with the adult ranged from one to three (Table 1). P8 and P14 participated in person with their families while P6, P7, P9 and their respective children participated virtually. P14 asked to do Study 1 and Study 2 as consecutive in-person sessions on the same day, so we incorporated a break to avoid fatigue."}, {"title": "5.2 Procedure", "content": "Sessions consisted of either two or three parts: (1) a semi-structured interview of the child(ren); (2) an AI-based analysis of the children's artwork followed by a discussion; and, for the in-person sessions, (3) a design probe. As with Study 1, we invited participants to share pictures of art pieces made by their children. Sessions lasted 30-90 minutes, and participants were paid $25 per hour for remote participation or a home visit, or $40 per hour if they traveled to us.\nDuring the semi-structured interview, we asked each child about how they share their artwork with their BLV family member, tools they use to create artwork, and what they wanted family members to know about their artwork. We leveraged artwork that participants shared with us by asking children to describe their art to their BLV family members.\nFor the AI interpretation, the lead researcher inputted the provided artwork into Be My AI and ChatGPT4, and shared the AI output with the family. We solicited the children's reactions to the Al descriptions, and their feelings around their BLV family member using AI tools to understand their art.\nThe two in-person studies ended with a design probe. This probe consisted of tactile, touchscreen, and audio representations of two different sample children's drawings collected from the authors who have children. One tactile representation used laser cutting, and another used raised dot stickers similar to swell paper; both are effective techniques used for nonvisual tactile explorations of artwork [35]. The touchscreen component utilized Seeing AI's \u201cExplore\u201d mode, allowing spatial exploration of the artwork [14]. After the adult and child tried each of the probes, we asked follow-up questions to capture their reactions to the different media. Owing to the tactile aspect of these design probes, we did not conduct probes for our Zoom sessions."}, {"title": "5.3 Analysis", "content": "As with Study 1, all Study 2 interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. We used similar analysis methods for both studies, including inductive and deductive coding, affinity diagramming to arrive at an initial codebook, and iterating on the codebook through peer debriefing for the final codes-the first author connected with the same researcher as for Study 1 analysis, presenting two Study 2 transcripts and the initial codebook."}, {"title": "6 STUDY 2 FINDINGS", "content": "We describe how children share their artwork with blind or low-vision (BLV) family members, including a distinction between context and content, how children react to hearing AI-generated descriptions of their art, and family responses to our design probes."}, {"title": "6.1 How Children Share Their Art", "content": "When children share their artwork with BLV family members, we found that they describe two inter-related attributes: the context-the inspiration for the art, its intention, where it was created, if it was co-created with another person (a sibling, a teacher), etc.;"}, {"title": "6.2 Children's Reactions to AI Tools", "content": "When hearing Al-generated output about their artwork, children preferred descriptions capturing aspects of the artwork they cared about, disliked and tried to rationalize when art elements were described incorrectly or omitted, and wanted to change inaccurate AI descriptions before their BLV relatives heard them.\nPreferences within descriptions. What children appreciated about Al descriptions directly followed from their personal interests and artistic preferences. As an example, if one AI description expressed details about all of the colors on a page correctly, a child who was more interested in colors, such as P14's 7-year old granddaughter, preferred that description; but a child who cared more about materials used in the artwork, such as P8's 9-year old great-granddaughter, expressed a preference for explanations of materials and techniques (oil painting, beads) more than colors.\nResponses to inaccuracies. When AI descriptions were mostly correct according to the children, children responded neutrally to those descriptions using vocabulary like \"good\" or \"correct.\" In contrast, all of the children swiftly and animatedly called out when AI interpretations got details wrong. P6's son did so when responding to Al descriptions mistakenly calling a turkey a cat in one of his drawings (Figure 6): \"[It is] totally incorrect... I hate that AI dude! Cause that is not a cat! It is not a cat.\"\nIn some instances, children tried to rationalize why the AI descriptions made incorrect assumptions. One of P14's granddaughters described why she thought the AI inaccurately inferred the position of a dragonfly in relation to a cat in one of her drawings: \u201cI can kind of tell why [the AI thought what it did]... That could be like a part of [the cat's] arm.\u201d As another example, both AI tools inferred it was raining in an image drawn by P9's daughter due to the presence of blue clouds. P9 and her daughter discussed the Al's inference, saying \u201cthe computer was taking a guess\u201d since rain is typically blue. However, P9's daughter explained that she only used blue because she \u201cdidn't have a white crayon.\u201d\nP8's great-grandchildren commented on the descriptions of the \u201cLove Monster\u201d (Figure 2) incorrectly identifying some details, such as the monster's eyes being \u201cwide open\u201d when they were, in fact, closed, and missing other details altogether, such as its feet and tail. When asked how they would feel if P8 had access to the two raw Al responses of their work, the children expressed that they would want to correct the descriptions before P8 heard them."}, {"title": "6.3 Responses to In-Person Design Probes", "content": "In our two in-person sessions with P8 and P14 and their children, we used design probes (Appendix, Figure 8) featuring audio, tactile, and touchscreen renditions of children's artwork. Responses indicated a preference for tactile and auditory representations over touchscreens and revealed how they envisioned using each type for artwork exploration. When comparing tactile and touchscreen representations, P8 described why touchscreens are challenging:\nP14's grandchildren helped orient her with the two tactile probes by guiding her hand over the work and describing the parts of the work as her hand reached each portion. The grandchildren described wanting to use a similar combination of tactile and verbal descriptions to share their own work with P14. P14 highlighted the importance of having the audio overview and tactile representation:"}, {"title": "7 DISCUSSION", "content": "Our two studies revealed current practices in mixed visual-ability families to engage with children's artwork, the information BLV family members wanted to access, as well as feedback about different technologies that might play a role in experiencing artwork. We situate these findings within prior work, discuss implications for technology designed to support these family interactions, and consider limitations and opportunities future work."}, {"title": "7.1 Revisiting Our Research Questions", "content": "Our two studies explored three high-level questions: (1) How do BLV family members currently engage with their children's artwork? (2) What information do they desire and why? and (3) What is the role of technology in aiding comprehension and interpretation? We revisit these questions below.\nTowards the first, we identified varied practices that centered the child and their verbal descriptions, which included distinctions between content (the what) and context (the why and the how). Some families also complemented verbal descriptions with hand guiding and tactile materials-affirming the use of multi-sensory art interpretation methods in the literature [26, 27, 35, 60]. Interestingly, we found that most BLV family members did not currently use technology with artwork; instead, families centered the child's perspective and storytelling. Many had not even considered using technology to explore and experience their children's art. In the few previous instances families did use systems such as Seeing AI, they found the descriptions overly simplistic and not meaningful.\nFor information preferences and rationale, we found that BLV family members considered the child's story behind the art as the most important to understand, which is why they centered children's perspectives of their artwork above other nonvisual representations. Indeed, a few BLV family members did not even care to learn about aesthetic details of the child-created work. In contrast, prior research has primarily focused on adult-created art in museums or professional settings, where BLV individuals displayed a stronger interest in understanding visual aesthetic details [19, 45]. When BLV family members did want descriptive characteristics, they were curious about the aesthetic quality of the work (colors, balance across the page, techniques) to help them understand their children's development and to appreciate the child's effort in making the art. Prior work by Li et al. [45] found that BLV individuals were motivated to learn about visual artwork for cultural learning, activism, social engagement, and relaxation. We extend these findings towards BLV family members' motivations for engaging with children's artwork, which were primarily for emotional connection and to understand children's developmental milestones.\nFinally, through the AI-based analyses and design probes, we found that AI descriptions were generally considered helpful by BLV family members, and that participants (adults and children) preferred audio and tactile representations of artwork. Our results around usefulness of AI in mixed visual-ability families extends prior findings by Zhang et al. [67] which highlight the benefits of AI in parent-child settings. Our results around audio and tactile being preferred by BLV individuals for accessing artwork also reaffirms findings from prior work [18, 45]. In Study 2, we were able to directly observe children's reactions to the AI descriptions, which unveiled mixed reactions. Recent work by Bai et al. [21] describes the unique opportunity for interaction design between emerging Al agents and children, which our study further reinforces-the children in our studies were curious about Al interpretations of their work and wanted to play an active role in correcting AI descriptions when they were inaccurate. To our knowledge, our work is the first to capture children's perspectives on AI descriptions in support of their BLV family members."}, {"title": "7.2 Implications for Design", "content": "Drawing on our findings", "57": "underscoring that a child's art is not just about the artwork itself but about the child's psychological and motor development", "45": ".", "child": "before, during"}]}

{"title": "Engaging with Children's Artwork in Mixed Visual-Ability Families", "authors": ["Arnavi Chheda-Kothary", "Jacob O. Wobbrock", "Jon E. Froehlich"], "abstract": "We present two studies exploring how blind or low-vision (BLV) family members engage with their sighted children's artwork, strategies to support understanding and interpretation, and the potential role of technology, such as AI, therein. Our first study involved 14 BLV individuals, and the second included five groups of BLV individuals with their children. Through semi-structured interviews with Al descriptions of children's artwork and multi-sensory design probes, we found that BLV family members value artwork engagement as a bonding opportunity, preferring the child's storytelling and interpretation over other nonvisual representations. Additionally, despite some inaccuracies, BLV family members felt that Al-generated descriptions could facilitate dialogue with their children and aid self-guided art discovery. We close with specific design considerations for supporting artwork engagement in mixed visual-ability families, including enabling artwork access through various methods, supporting children's corrections of AI output, and distinctions in context vs. content and interpretation vs. description of children's artwork.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Artistic creation is intrinsic to childhood. Through art, children creatively express themselves, impacting happiness, social skills, intellectual development, and confidence [6, 47, 57]. To support the joy and creativity that artistic expression fosters in children, it is important that parents and relatives engage with their children's artwork [5]. Art-based interactions between parents and children, such as co-creating artwork or participating in art therapy, also enable deeper parent-child closeness [3] and positively affect children's perceptions of acceptance [4]. While the importance of artistic creation and art-based interactions between child and parent is well-established, there are open questions about how blind or low-vision (BLV) parents and relatives engage with their sighted children's artwork, such as how they perceive visual art creations, provide encouragement and feedback, and what, if any, tools and techniques they might use to help them explore their children's creative output.\nAlthough recent research and technology advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital fabrication (3-D printers, laser cutters) have explored nonvisual access to visual artifacts, including BLV-accessible art creation tools [46], tactile representations of professional artwork [26, 35], and AI-based applications for image descriptions [12, 14], a gap remains in our understanding of how BLV family members engage with visual creations made by their children. In this work, we explore: (1) How do BLV family members currently engage with their children's artwork? (2) What information about their children's artwork do BLV family members want to have available? (3) How can BLV family members use technology to enhance engagement with their children's artwork?\nTo investigate these questions, we conducted two semi-structured interview studies. In Study 1, we recruited 14 BLV family members and asked questions about current strategies to support understanding and interpretation of their children's artwork, motivations for and barriers to doing so, and their use of technology in aiding comprehension. For Study 2, we recruited a subset of BLV family members from Study 1 with their children; here our focus was on the child, the child's process of creating and sharing art, and the child-adult interaction. Both studies gathered feedback about AI interpretations of their children's artwork using two state-of-the-art tools: Be My AI [12] and ChatGPT4 [10]. The second study also utilized design probes with two in-person relative-and-child groups to explore non-visual art representations preferences. Interview sessions were recorded, transcribed, and then iteratively coded to reach a set of themes concerning current practices and underlying motivations, desired information about artwork, and responses to actual or potential technology."}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "Our work builds on prior research in non-visual representations of artwork and images, the emerging role of AI, and how technology supports mixed-ability interactions."}, {"title": "2.1 Nonvisual Representation of Art and Images", "content": "There is a rich history of work in human-computer interaction (HCI) investigating nonvisual representations of art and images for blind and low-vision (BLV) people [9, 22, 31, 42, 48, 50, 61, 65]. In the digital realm, BLV people primarily interpret images through access technology such as screen readers, which read human- or AI- generated alternative text descriptions (ALT text) [9, 22, 50]. Several commercial applications, including Be My Eyes [15] and Seeing AI [14], provide human or AI description services for live scenes as well as images.\nResearchers have increasingly explored alternate modalities to represent images and graphics, including touchscreen-based image interactions [44, 51], tactile representations [27], electrotactile feedback [40], vibrofeedback [37], sonification [36], and multimodal systems [39, 59, 63]. Tactile graphics creation techniques include 3D printing [60], swell touch paper [35], laser cutting [26, 35], refreshable tactile displays [8], and do-it-yourself (DIY) strategies [68]. Touchscreens afford direct spatial input via touch and audio output, but lack tactility. Tactile representations offer high tactility but can be more challenging to produce, and static, rather than dynamic."}, {"title": "2.2 AI as a Tool for BLV People", "content": "With recent advances in generative AI (GAI), new AI-powered BLV tools have emerged such as Be My AI [12], a GPT-backed [10] system available through Be My Eyes; OKO [7], a navigation application for pedestrian safety that also uses GPT; and AI advancements in screen readers such as JAWS [17] for improved picture interpretation.\nResearch by Gonzalez et al. [34] explores BLV people's usage and trust of AI tools to describe visual content. Through a diary study, they identify ways to improve AI descriptions to increase trustworthiness to BLV people. Huh et al. [38] leverage different Al models to unlock a more accessible experience for the BLV community when creating and vetting AI-generated images. Glazko et al. [33] report on self-usage of GAI tools; a BLV researcher on the team talked through pros and cons of using GAI to write code and vet generated user interface layouts. However, the effects of the latest advances in GAI have not yet been evaluated in the context of mixed visual-ability families. Additionally, there is scant understanding of how these AI tools perform on diverse types of children's drawings."}, {"title": "2.3 Supporting Mixed-Ability Groups", "content": "A mixed-ability group is any group with some members having a disability and others not [64]. We draw upon prior research investigating technology in mixed-ability spaces for our work in mixed visual-ability families. For example, Phutane et al. [54] investigate tactile materials by teachers of BLV students, highlighting how tactile as a medium can be used for communicating visual concepts in mixed visual-ability settings. Branham and Kane employ semi-structured interviews and field studies as qualitative methods to examine how blind and sighted companions co-create accessible home spaces [23] and how blind employees navigate mixed-ability workplaces [24]; our studies are methodologically similar, as we"}, {"title": "3 STUDY 1: INTERVIEWS WITH BLV ADULTS", "content": "To explore how blind and low-vision (BLV) family members' and their sighted children engage with child-created art and strategies to support understanding and interpretation, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 14 BLV adult participants (Study 1). We then conducted a complementary study (Study 2) with five BLV family members and their children to gain an understanding of the child's perspective, to directly observe responses to AI and tactile interpretations of their work, and to examine cross-generational dynamics. We report on Study 1 below."}, {"title": "3.1 Participants", "content": "We recruited 14 BLV family members of sighted children, including both parents and non-parent relatives (e.g., grandparents) through email lists, social media posts, and snowball sampling [2]. All family members were 18 years of age or older. Participants were located throughout the United States and had the option of participating virtually through Zoom, over the phone, or in person."}, {"title": "3.2 Procedure", "content": "Study 1 consisted of three parts: (1) a pre-study questionnaire, filled out prior to the session starting, (2) a semi-structured interview, and (3) a demonstration and discussion of AI-based descriptions of children's artwork. Sessions lasted for 60 minutes. All participants were compensated $25.\nThe pre-study questionnaire collected demographics as well as information about vision loss and their children's art. For the semi-structured interview, we asked questions about how participants currently engage with their children's artwork, their motivations and desires to learn about the art and art process, and the tools and techniques they use to understand and interpret the art.\nTo examine the potential for Al as an access tool for children's artwork, we invited participants to share their child-created art pieces. At the end of the study, we inputted these images into two state-of-the-art AI tools, Be My AI [12] and ChatGPT4 (i.e., ChatGPT using GPT-4) [10], and shared the AI output with participants. We solicited reactions to the AI descriptions, feelings about using AI to learn about their children's art, and potential opportunities and"}, {"title": "3.3 Analysis", "content": "All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. For analysis, we used deductive and inductive coding [1], drawing on our interview protocol for deductive codes and affinity diagramming [25, 41] of transcripts for inductive codes, thereby arriving at our initial codebook. The first author then engaged in peer debriefing [52] with another researcher (who was given two transcripts and the codebook) to iterate on the codes. Both researchers met to resolve disagreements, updated the codebook, and the first author then re-analyzed all transcripts with the final codes."}, {"title": "4 STUDY 1 FINDINGS", "content": "We report on how blind or low-vision (BLV) family members engage with their children's artwork, their motivations and concerns, and strategies for understanding and interpretation-from conversations with the child to the use of technology and AI. Throughout, we highlight the emotional and intimate connection between the child and adult that is often cultivated through art. Quotes have been lightly edited for grammar, concision, and anonymity."}, {"title": "4.1 Current Practices", "content": "We identified five common approaches for how BLV family members engage with their children's artwork, including: most commonly, talking with the child about the artwork (N=14/14) or asking a sighted adult partner (N=10); other sensory approaches, such as having the child guide their hand to trace outlines (N=4) or using tactile materials or other access adaptations (N=4); and, finally, using technology tools (N=3) such as Seeing AI and Be My Eyes. For low-vision family members who retain some sight, a common technique was to take a picture of the art with their phone and zoom in to discern more detail (N=3).\nWhen first presented with an art piece, all participants mentioned inviting the child to describe their artwork verbally and then asked directed follow-up questions. As P1 described: \u201cThe trick is to say, 'Oh that's so nice. Tell me about it. And then they'll explain it. From that, you can ask some follow up questions like, \u2018Which was your favorite color you used?' By asking the questions, they tell the story.\u201d However, P9 and P10, both mothers, noted a balance between information seeking vs. feeling burdensome. P10 said: \u201cI am a blind mom, but that doesn't mean I monopolize all her time and energy to describe everything to my satisfaction."}, {"title": "4.2 Motivation for Engaging with Artwork", "content": "We also examined underlying motivations, concerns, and fears related to how BLV family members connect to and engage with children's artwork. Overall, participants emphasized the emotional and bonding value of exploring and understanding their child's artwork (N=14/14), how it enabled them to track developmental progress (N=4), and, for one family, how creative expression through art acted as a source of individual and collective healing. Concerning bonding, P6, a father, said:\nP3 echoed this sentiment of wanting children to feel satisfied with his response: \"If you appear standoff-ish, chances are they will not want to come back to you again with a new piece of artwork because they were not satisfied with your response in the first place.\" P4 and P10 both highlighted that artwork was a source of immense pride for their children, which is why it felt important for them to understand their art. P7 similarly described wanting to grow with his children's interests \u201cand show that I'm genuinely interested in what [they] like\". P2 discussed that, as a single father, he cultivates a family dynamic where he can \u201cengage in everything\u201d.\nAnother motivation, expressed by parents more than other relatives, was to use an understanding of artwork to evaluate their"}, {"title": "4.3 Preferences for Accessing Artwork", "content": "We asked what information BLV family members desire about their children's artwork and how they prefer to gain that information-and identified two interdependent response themes: (1) descriptive information such as color, medium, and object location, and (2) interpretive information, such as why the child created the art, their artistic choices, and what pieces of the art mean to the child. The distinction between gaining descriptive vs. interpretative information also corresponded to access preferences.\nAccess method preferences. All 14 participants valued children's verbal descriptions over any other approach because they centered the children's perspectives of their artwork, and allowed them to mix both description (e.g., colors used) and interpretation (e.g., why they used such colors and what they mean). Three of 14 adult participants emphasized that they do not need to know artwork traits beyond what their child wants to describe-and that there is so much more to art than the characteristics of the piece itself. As P12 expressed: \"Just listening to the enjoyment that he gets from sharing his artwork, even though it's not super descriptive... that's enough for me.\" Similarly, P11 emphasized understanding her child's intention behind his work as more important than knowing the exact visual output:\nP9 mentioned that she had found herself more curious about descriptive details as her daughter aged, but she prioritized intent and the importance of listening to the child's perspective: \"The most important thing to me is hearing them talk about their intent and... about what they've created... [for me] the biggest piece is, 'Tell me what you want me to know about your artwork.'\"\nIn addition to verbal descriptions, participants emphasized the benefits of tactility, which allowed for a different experience of the artwork. For example, P6 felt tactile modalities allowed more objective details of his son's work: \u201cI think as he gets older, I would prefer tactile more... The representation gets more intricate and also gets more accurate.\u201d P4 enjoys both auditory descriptions and tactile representations, but that when doing art with her grandson (age 4), her preferred medium is tactile: \u201cWhen I'm with my grandchild, I think the tactile part helps me a lot to see where he's going with his imagination.\u201d She also emphasized that this is situation-dependent: \u201cWhen I go to the art museum, [descriptions are] fabulous, because the description is almost like painting a picture in my mind.\u201d\nThere were some concerns about tactile modes, including: worries about damaging the art during touch-based exploration if it exists in a tactile representation (P7), uncertainty about how to even start trying to represent child-created artwork in a tactile manner (P5), and the flimsy nature of DIY tactile art (P12).\nThe interpretation gap. The different access method preferences highlighted underlying tensions between description and interpretation. P3 and P7 discussed the gap between what a child describes to you and what is on the paper. P3 called this \"the interpretation gap\":\nIndeed, some participants contemplated the dichotomy between hearing the child's interpretation and a more objective description-a tension that also emerged with using AI tools (see Section 4.4). As P6 explained:\nFor P3 and P7, bridging the interpretation gap required access to both the child's perspective and a more objective description. P7 said that he often asks his sighted wife for the latter but can also converse with his children (ages 7 and 9) as they get older:"}, {"title": "4.4 Reactions to AI Tools", "content": "At the end of the study, we invited participants to share their children's artwork and analyzed them with two Al tools: Be My AI and ChatGPT4. Ten of our 14 participants had artwork available and took part in this portion of the study. In general, most participants (N=9) reacted positively but also discussed the lack of emotional depth, accuracy (e.g., discrepancies between the two AI descriptions), and how this technology could be used in the future.\nPotential benefits. Our participants identified several key benefits of using Al to analyze children artwork, including: the ability to discern details that were otherwise inaccessible (e.g., colors, painting techniques), access to information that could further conversation and connection with their child, and using AI to complement the child's description, particularly when they were not available (e.g., P10's former partner sends pictures of her daughter's work when her daughter is staying with him). As one poignant example, P7, a father, had taken his family on a trip to his alma mater"}, {"title": "5 STUDY 2: CHILDREN AND BLV FAMILY", "content": "To complement Study 1, we conducted a follow-up study with a subset of Study 1 participants along with their children (Table 1). Here, our goal was to focus on the child and their process of creating and sharing their art with the blind or low-vision (BLV) adult: how did the child think about their creations? Were their artistic choices, materials, or method of sharing influenced by a potential BLV audience? How did they feel about and react to AI interpretations of their work?

As with Study 1, we invited participants to share pictures of art pieces made by their children. Sessions lasted 30-90 minutes, and participants were paid $25 per hour for remote participation or a home visit, or $40 per hour if they traveled to us.\nDuring the semi-structured interview, we asked each child about how they share their artwork with their BLV family member, tools they use to create artwork, and what they wanted family members to know about their artwork. We leveraged artwork that participants shared with us by asking children to describe their art to their BLV family members.\nFor the AI interpretation, the lead researcher inputted the provided artwork into Be My AI and ChatGPT4, and shared the AI output with the family. We solicited the children's reactions to the Al descriptions, and their feelings around their BLV family member using AI tools to understand their art.\nThe two in-person studies ended with a design probe. This probe consisted of tactile, touchscreen, and audio representations of two different sample children's drawings collected from the authors who have children. One tactile representation used laser cutting, and another used raised dot stickers similar to swell paper; both are effective techniques used for nonvisual tactile explorations of artwork [35]. The touchscreen component utilized Seeing Al's \"Explore\" mode, allowing spatial exploration of the artwork [14]. After the adult and child tried each of the probes, we asked follow-up questions to capture their reactions to the different media. Owing to the tactile aspect of these design probes, we did not conduct probes for our Zoom sessions."}, {"title": "5.3 Analysis", "content": "As with Study 1, all Study 2 interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.

What children appreciated about Al descriptions directly followed from their personal interests and artistic preferences. As an example, if one AI description expressed details about all of the colors on a page correctly, a child who was more interested in colors, such as P14's 7-year old granddaughter, preferred that description; but a child who cared more about materials used in the artwork, such as P8's 9-year old great-granddaughter, expressed a preference for explanations of materials and techniques (oil painting, beads) more than colors.\nResponses to inaccuracies. When AI descriptions were mostly correct according to the children, children responded neutrally to those descriptions using vocabulary like \"good\" or \"correct.\" In contrast, all of the children swiftly and animatedly called out when AI interpretations got details wrong. P6's son did so when responding to Al descriptions mistakenly calling a turkey a cat in one of his drawings: \"[It is] totally incorrect... I hate that AI dude! Cause that is not a cat! It is not a cat.\"\nIn some instances, children tried to rationalize why the AI descriptions made incorrect assumptions. One of P14's granddaughters described why she thought the AI inaccurately inferred the position of a dragonfly in relation to a cat in one of her drawings: \"I can kind of tell why [the AI thought what it did]... That could be like a part of [the cat's] arm.\" As another example, both AI tools inferred it was raining in an image drawn by P9's daughter due to the presence of blue clouds.

Responses indicated a preference for tactile and auditory representations over touchscreens and revealed how they envisioned using each type for artwork exploration. When comparing tactile and touchscreen representations, P8 described why touchscreens are challenging:\nP14's grandchildren helped orient her with the two tactile probes by guiding her hand over the work and describing the parts of the work as her hand reached each portion. The grandchildren described wanting to use a similar combination of tactile and verbal descriptions to share their own work with P14. P14 highlighted the importance of having the audio overview and tactile representation:"}, {"title": "7 DISCUSSION", "content": "Our two studies revealed current practices in mixed visual-ability families to engage with children's artwork, the information BLV family members wanted to access, as well as feedback about different technologies that might play a role in experiencing artwork. We situate these findings within prior work, discuss implications for technology designed to support these family interactions, and consider limitations and opportunities future work."}, {"title": "7.1 Revisiting Our Research Questions", "content": "Our two studies explored three high-level questions: (1) How do BLV family members currently engage with their children's artwork? (2) What information do they desire and why? and (3) What is the role of technology in aiding comprehension and interpretation? We revisit these questions below.\nTowards the first, we identified varied practices that centered the child and their verbal descriptions, which included distinctions between content (the what) and context (the why and the how). Some families also complemented verbal descriptions with hand guiding and tactile materials-affirming the use of multi-sensory art interpretation methods in the literature [26, 27, 35, 60]. Interestingly, we found that most BLV family members did not currently use technology with artwork; instead, families centered the child's perspective and storytelling. Many had not even considered using technology to explore and experience their children's art. In the few previous instances families did use systems such as Seeing AI, they found the descriptions overly simplistic and not meaningful.\nFor information preferences and rationale, we found that BLV family members considered the child's story behind the art as the most important to understand, which is why they centered children's perspectives of their artwork above other nonvisual representations. Indeed, a few BLV family members did not even care to learn about aesthetic details of the child-created work. In contrast, prior research has primarily focused on adult-created art in museums or professional settings, where BLV individuals displayed a stronger interest in understanding visual aesthetic details [19, 45]. When BLV family members did want descriptive characteristics, they were curious about the aesthetic quality of the work (colors, balance across the page, techniques) to help them understand their children's development and to appreciate the child's effort in making the art. Prior work by Li et al. [45] found that BLV individuals were motivated to learn about visual artwork for cultural learning,"}, {"title": "7.2 Implications for Design", "content": "Drawing on our findings, we recommend the following design considerations for future technology to support the value of relational bonding over child-created artwork, nuances of art access, and different mediums for art representation, while reserving AI considerations for the next section.\nRelational support. Our findings build on prior work in art and child development [5, 6, 47, 57], underscoring that a child's art is not just about the artwork itself but about the child's psychological and motor development, the intimate stories and context surrounding the art, and the personal connections between child and relative. Tools that enable access to child-created artwork should not just support objective understanding and interpretation, but also the relationship between child and BLV family member.\nTechnology complements storytelling. Technology cannot and will not replace a child's perspective of their artwork-their personal choices of color, of theme, of motivation. Thus, any technology should be considered complementary to the child's perspective. Still, we found a desire by BLV family members to support independent analysis of their child's artwork for personal curiosity and to further nurture conversations with their children.\nThe nuances of art access. Our work identifies distinctions between content and context and description vs. interpretation. In prior work observing BLV individuals' preferences for professional or museum artwork, access to content and description (where description could include professional interpretation by art critics or the artist) mattered [45]. Our work revealed the added nuances within mixed visual-ability family settings-content, context, description, and the child's own interpretation all hold value for how BLV family members understand their children's artwork.\nThe stages of access. We observed three stages of access centered around the interaction with the child: before, during, and after. BLV family members desired access to information about the artwork"}, {"title": "7.3 Al-based Design Considerations", "content": "We extend our recommendations to consider the role of AI in supporting mixed visual-ability families, given the recent advancements and proliferation of AI tools for BLV individuals.\nOptimize for personal preference factors. BLV individuals have personal preferences regarding interpretive and descriptive characteristics of child-created artwork, such as color or technique. Children additionally get excited by highlighting noteworthy artwork elements for their BLV family members. Al tools should support preference inputs from the BLV adult and their children to craft tailored descriptions of artwork. For example, a description could be more or less interpretive, or focus mostly on colors used, depending on the interests of the family.\nSupport child corrections of inaccurate descriptions. Children are proud of the artwork they produce and dislike when AI tools incorrectly describe their work. They also want to correct inaccurate descriptions before their BLV family members hear them. Human-in-the-loop systems for correcting AI exist, and prior work explores inclusive applications of such systems [32]; we recommend making these correction workflows accessible for children to support fixing inaccurate AI descriptions for their BLV family members.\nUtilize multiple models for artwork descriptions. BLV individuals get different information from different AI tools, and they prefer accessing all of these descriptions to build a holistic understanding of their children's artwork. Al description tools should enable this with ease for BLV individuals-as an example, a single unified system could act as a front-end to multiple AI models, returning different descriptions together for simultaneous consumption, similar to a news aggregator."}, {"title": "7.4 Limitations and Future Work", "content": "A limitation of our present work is that we could only conduct the in-person design probes with two BLV families, neither of which included a parent-child pair (instead, they were grandparent-grandchildren groups). We designed flexible studies [49] to support access needs for BLV adults as well as minors, and many people preferred participating remotely. However, additional in-person design probes might uncover further insights into the preferences and motivations that BLV parents and relatives have for experiencing their children's artwork. We also noticed that younger children often felt shy in the semi-structured interview portion of our second study, which could have affected the perspectives they shared. Additionally, we lacked language and region diversity in our participant pool, since we only recruited English-speaking families within the United States. This could affect the relevancy of our findings to other cultures or geographies.\nOur project and its findings open numerous avenues for future work to support mixed visual-ability families. Observational field studies of BLV relative-and-child artwork engagement would yield data in more natural, ecologically valid settings. Systems might be built that leverage Al to support aspects of the BLV adult-child experience of artwork, with features for description vs. interpretation, correction of AI, aggregation of sources, interrogation, and and drill-down. We also encourage more investment in AI literacy for mixed visual-ability families as AI becomes more prominent."}, {"title": "8 CONCLUSION", "content": "In this work, we conducted two complementary studies to explore how mixed visual-ability families engage with and experience their sighted children's artwork, capturing both the perspective and practices of the children artists as well as their blind or low-vision (BLV) family members. We found that BLV family members value the intimate and emotional practice of engaging in conversations with their children about their artwork, and prize their children's perceptions of their art above other descriptions. In terms of alternate access of child-created artwork, our two design probes showed that BLV family members and their children preferred generated audio descriptions and tactile representations. Additionally, many BLV adults stated that as their children age and their artwork becomes more intricate, tactile would be a meaningful way to consume that work. We also found that though there are reasons why BLV family members want more objective descriptions of children's artwork, such as tracking their children's developmental progress or enabling independent exploration of the art for deeper dialog with their children, any technology supplementing this family dynamic needs to prioritize the perspective and storytelling of the child about their own work. Centering the child's narrative also means that AI tools"}]}

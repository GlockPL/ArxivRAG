In September 2024, I\ntested the recently released model GPT-4o1-preview on the same collection.

The first two datasets were written by Davis, the third was written by\nAaronson; they reflect the interests and tastes of their authors.\nOf the 32 \"Arbitrary Numerical\" problems, O1 got 8 (#s 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 30, and 32) wrong and\nthe remaining 24 right. In our earlier experiment, we gave ChatGPT plus Wolfram Alpha a score\nof 8.25, with completely correct answers on 6 and 75 partial credit on each of 3. The remaining 23\nwere completely wrong. ChatGPT plus Code Interpreter got 10 completely right and 22 wrong.\nOf the 53 \"Calculation-Free\" problems, O1 got five (#s 4-8, and 14) wrong and the remaining 48\nright. In our earlier experiment, ChatGPT plus Wolfram Alpha got 22 completely wrong, 3 nearly\nright, and 28 completely right. ChatGPT plus Code Interpreter got 18 completely wrong, 1 more\nwrong than right, 3 nearly right, and 31 completely right.\nOf the 20 \"Motivated Numerical\" problems O1 got two (#s 16 and 17) wrong and the remaining 18\nright.

An exact integer value is required.\nO1 correctly determined the dates of Jules Verne's death and the moon landing, and then enumerated\na list of dates between those two that it claimed came from the information in NASA's \u201cLunar Eclipse\nPage\". However, the dates that O1 bore no relation to the dates that NASA lists for the twentieth\ncentury. I was unable to find the source of the list of dates that Ol used.\nProblem 8 reads: A physical process generates photons whose energies follow a random distribution\nof the following form: For positive energy e, the probability density at e is proportional to the value\nof e in a Gaussian distribution with mean 2 Ev and standard deviation 0.01 Ev. The probability\nof a negative value is zero. What is the expected value of the wavelength of a photon produced\nby this process? (Give the mathematical answer, assuming that the above description is exact,\nand assuming the standard relation between energy and wavelength in a photo. The answer is not\nphysically plausible.)\nThe point of this problem is that, as the wavelength A goes to 0, the probability density P(X)\napproaches a limit that, though tiny, is non-zero. Since the frequency is h/A, the integral for the\nexpected value diverges and the expected value is infinite. O1 missed that point, and computed the\nvalue of the integral omitting the divergence at 0.\nProblem 12 reads: A pendulum is hanging on a 2 meter cord attached to the ceiling 3 meters\nabove the floor. It is brought to a position 25 degrees from the vertical and released. It swings past\nthe bottom and the cord is cut when it is 10 degrees from the vertical on the far side. Then the\nbob flies through the air and hits the ground. What is the distance from the point where the bob is\nreleased to the point where it hit the ground?\nO1 did this nearly correctly, but took the y-component of the velocity when the string is done to be\nnegative instead of positive. That is, it failed to realize that the bob is now swinging upward.\nProblem 15 reads as follows: Draw a circle, on the earth's surface, going through Cairo, Peking,\nand Moscow.

The surface of the moon, illuminated only by starlight.\nD. The surface of the moon, illuminated by the sun.\nE. The sun.\nF. The day side of the earth, with a small circular shadow moving quickly over it.\nG. The night side of the earth. The sun is somewhere else entirely.\nH. A starry sky. Neither the sun, the earth, or the surface of the moon is in the field of\nview.\nThe eight problems correspond to the eight possible combinations of the above options. Ol got the\ncorrect answers for the problems where the astronaut is in the Sea of Tranquility, but gave the same\nanswer for the corresponding problems where the astronaut is on the dark side of the moon. In\neffect, it failed to realize that the moon would occlude the astronaut's view of earth; and, in the case\nof an astronaut looking at the sun during a solar eclipse, that the moon would no longer occlude\ntheir view of the sun.\nProblem 14 reads as follows: Joe says that he lives 1000 miles from Walden Pond, that Beth lives\n1000 miles from Lake Michigan, and that he and Beth live 10 miles apart. Is it possible that Joe is\ntelling the truth? Answer \"Yes\" or \"No\u201d.\n01 answered, incorrectly, \"No\". It gave no explanation, following its instructions. Problems 9\nthrough 15 are problems of a similar flavor, which effectively require the answerer to determine how\nthe triangle inequality applies in situation with extended objects. Certainly a success rate of 6 out\nof 7 does not statistically exclude the null hypothesis of random guessing (the probability is 1/16).\nProblems 21-32 present a triple of cities, such as Caracas, Venezuela; Amarillo, Texas; and Quebec,\nQuebec; and asks whether a cycle in that order is clockwise or counterclockwise. O1 answered all\nthese correctly by looking up the latitude and longitude of the cities involved, and applied the\n\"Shoelace\" formula for signed areas directly to the latitudes and longitudes, as if they were drawn\non a flat map split at the 180\u00b0 longitude line. (To be precise, I only tested three of the examples;\nsince Ol had found this method of answering the questions, it seemed clear that barring some very\nstrange error, it would continue answering all of them correctly.) It would be interesting to know\nhow Ol found this somewhat obscure procedure is it somewhere laid out explicitly in the training\nset, or did Ol combine other procedures to arrive at it but that would probably be very hard to\ndetermine.\nThere are other kinds of questions that would probe the depth of an AI's comprehension of clockwise\nvs. counterclockwise rotation:\n\u2022 Use a cycle where Ol's method will give the wrong answer.

Please include all calculations.\nIn doing the multistep calculation, Ol at one point dropped a factor of \u03c0\u00b2, and thus miscalculated\nthe answer.\nProblem 17 reads: Assume that IQs are normally distributed, with a mean of 100 and a standard\ndeviation of 15. For which n does the number of people with IQ n exceed the number of people with\nIQ n+1 by the maximum amount?

It is probably comparable, on these datasets, to a strong math or physics major who has access\nto Wikipedia to look up the physical constants and geographical information and to a calculator to\ndo the computations. It is still not perfect on these datasets. In particular, spatial reasoning is a\npoint of weakness; most of the problems that it got wrong were either purely geometric or involved\na failure of spatial reasoning in solving a physics problem."}]}

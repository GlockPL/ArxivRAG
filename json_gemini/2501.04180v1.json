Remarkable progress has been achieved in the past, but it is unclear if the findings equip for real-world problems. While pressure grows, some of the most critical ecological challenges can find mitigation and prevention solutions through technology and its applications. Most real-world domains include multi-agent scenarios and require machine-machine and human-machine collaboration. Open-source environments have not advanced and are often toy scenarios, too abstract or not suitable for multi-agent research. By mimicking real-world problems and increasing the complexity of environments, we hope to advance state-of-the-art multi-agent research and inspire researchers to work on immediate real-world problems.\nHere, we present HIVEX, an environment suite to benchmark multi-agent research focusing on ecological challenges. HIVEX includes the following environments: Wind Farm Control, Wildfire Resource Management, Drone-Based Reforestation, Ocean Plastic Collection, and Aerial Wildfire Suppression. We provide environments, training examples, and baselines for the main and sub-tasks. 1 All trained models resulting from the experiments of this work are hosted on Hugging Face. 2 We also provide a leaderboard on Hugging Face and encourage the community to submit models trained on our environment suite.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "Currently, no open-source benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) closely mimics real-world scenarios focused on critical ecological challenges, offering sub-tasks, fine-grained terrain elevation or various layout patterns, supporting open-ended learning through procedurally generated environments and providing visual richness. Most common benchmarks with direct real-world applications are in the following domains: 1. intelligent machines and devices, 2. chemical engineering, biotechnology, and medical treatment, 3. human and society, and 4. social dilemmas Ning & Xie (2024).\nThe main HIVEX environment features are either procedurally generated or sampled from a random distribution. Therefore, training and evaluation are differentiated by seed values, ensuring testing scenarios are not seen during training. We aim to assess and compare MARL algorithms, focusing on test-time evaluation with zero-shot test scenarios. If applicable, a scenario consists of an environment and a task-pattern or terrain elevation combination. Each environment has a main end-to-end task and isolated subtasks that are independent or part of the main task. Environments have between two and nine tasks, various layout patterns, or terrain elevation levels. The environments described are ordered by increasing complexity in observation size and type, action count and type, and reward granularity, including individual and collective rewards. We introduce combinations of vector and visual observations and discrete and continuous actions.\nClimate change is manifesting more visibly and urgently than ever Archer & Rahmstorf (2010); Romm (2022).

A study at Arizona State University, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explores the concept of 'rate-induced tipping' in ecological systems Panahi et al. (2023). This research is crucial in understanding when certain environmental systems, such as coral reefs, may reach a point of irreversible damage Hughes et al. (2018).\nAs ocean temperatures rise due to increased carbon emissions Venegas et al. (2023), corals and their symbiotic zooxanthellae (tiny cells that live within most types of coral polyps - they help the coral survive by providing it with food resulting from photosynthesis) are pushed towards a threshold beyond which severe bleaching occurs Sully et al. (2019), leading to a cascade of effects on the entire reef ecosystem. This bleaching, once initiated, cannot be reversed even if ocean temperatures were to subsequently stabilize, illustrating the permanent nature of some climate change impacts. The study emphasizes that even gradual changes in environmental parameters can suddenly trigger catastrophic system collapses, highlighting the urgency of addressing climate change proactively to prevent irreversible ecological damage Panahi et al.

According to the latest insights, there's a pressing need to accelerate climate action significantly to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This target requires deep, rapid, and sustained greenhouse gas emissions reductions across all sectors within this decade. Emissions need to decrease immediately to stay within these limits and be cut by nearly half by 2030 Calvin et al. (2023).

(2016). While the situation is grave, there is immense potential for innovative solutions in areas such as renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and resource-efficient industrial practices. The commitment to tackling these challenges is about averting disaster and harnessing the opportunity for significant environmental, economic, and social progress Berendt (2019); Hager et al. (2019).\nThe last two years have brought climate change to the doorstep of many. Extreme heatwaves, wildfires, and floods make life increasingly difficult for animals and humans De-Arteaga et al. (2018). ML has emerged as a key tool for technological advancement in recent years. As ML and artificial intelligence (AI) use in societal and global initiatives grows, there's a pressing need to explore how these technologies can best address climate change challenges. Many in the ML field are eager to contribute but unsure of the best approach, while various sectors are increasingly seeking ML expertise."}, {"title": "3.1 ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING", "content": "ML has many applications in combating climate change for various time horizons and degrees of impact Rolnick et al. (2022); Ladi et al. (2022). Straight forward applications However, we think it's crucial to acknowledge its fundamental role in enhancing our understanding of climate complexities Yu et al. (2013); Faghmous & Kumar (2014). ML, with its advanced data analysis capabilities, is instrumental in deciphering the multifaceted nature of climate data. It aids scientists and researchers in identifying patterns and trends that are not immediately apparent Climate TRACE (2022), providing insights into phenomena like temperature changes, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events. This deepened understanding is the bedrock upon which targeted solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation are developed.\nIn the critical battle against climate change, ML emerges as a pivotal ally, offering a diverse array of contributions across various domains. By enabling automatic monitoring through remote sensing, ML helps in identifying key environmental changes, such as deforestation, and in assessing post-disaster damages. This technology is particularly significant in the realm of ecosystem informatics and sustainability, where it aids in understanding complex ecological dynamics and biodiversity, supporting conservation efforts and sustainable resource management Dietterich (2009); Gomes et al. (2019); L\u00e4ssig et al. (2016). ML's ability to process vast amounts of ecological data enhances our capacity to track species populations, monitor habitat changes, and predict ecological responses to various environmental stressors.\nFurther, ML accelerates scientific discovery, suggesting innovative materials for batteries, construction, and carbon capture technologies. Ecosystem informatics enables the identification of patterns and relationships within ecological systems, facilitating the development of strategies to protect and sustain these vital systems. Additionally, ML optimizes systems for enhanced efficiency, evident in applications like freight consolidation, carbon market design, and reduction of food waste Joppa (2017). Its ability to accelerate computationally intense physical simulations, like climate and energy scheduling models, is invaluable. The integration of ML in these areas not only addresses immediate environmental concerns but also fosters long-term sustainability and resilience of ecosystems, thus playing a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. Figure 3 shows an increase of patents granted for climate inventions, AI inventions and climate and AI between 1970 and 2020. This means we can directly link advancements in AI to innovation in climate-related topics.\nThe integration of ML in climate change mitigation not only benefits society but also propels advancements in ML itself, particularly in areas such as interpretability, causality, and uncertainty quantification. However, the challenge lies in the nature of climate-relevant data, which is often proprietary, sensitive, or not globally representative. Solutions like transfer learning and domain"}, {"title": "3.2 NATURAL SOCIETIES AND MULTI-AGENT RESEARCH", "content": "In MARL environments, groups of agents with baseline intelligence and ability can have a higher collective intelligence by acting together Cohen et al. (1997). A shared pool of information through a collective observation space can help individual agents to learn quicker. Additionally, as a group, they can achieve objectives that would be challenging to attain individually Guestrin et al. (2002); Decker (1987); Panait & Luke (2005); MATARIC (1998). However, acting as a collective requires collaboration. From the perspective of an individual agent, other agents in the collective and the consequences of their actions, i.e. change of the environment, can be seen as part of a dynamic environment Ravula et al. (2019). Perceiving others' actions and making sense of their intention is called intention reading, stated in the theory-of-mind (ToM) Hernandez-Leal et al. (2019). While this is an integral part of human collaborative activities, we will assume shared intentionality Tomasello et al. (2005).\nIn our quest to advance multi-agent systems and cooperative strategies, the study of animal societies like ants and meerkats offers invaluable lessons. These natural societies, characterized by intricate cooperation and complex social structures, provide a blueprint for understanding and designing efficient, self-organizing systems in human contexts.\nAnts and Cooperative Robots: Researchers at Harvard University explored how ants cooperate to solve complex problems like transporting and building things using simple rules. They studied black carpenter ants and created a simulation to model their cooperative behaviour. This model was then used to develop robot ants (RAnts) that demonstrated similar cooperative behaviours to real ants, highlighting the potential for applying natural cooperation strategies in robotics Prasath et al. (2022). Recent work of ours explores distributed robotics for building architectural structures Hosmer et al. (2023), in which robotics help each other to climb, add and remove bespoke building blocks for a dynamically changing spatial configuration.\nAnt Colonies and Social Evolution: Certain ant species, which do not have a leader, can exhibit complex behaviours like the division of labour through self-organization. This challenges the notion that strong groups require strong leaders and suggests that even in the simplest groups, significant collaboration can occur. This research has implications for understanding the evolution of social behaviour and the early stages of complex society formation Gordon (2010; 2002).\nMeerkats and Cooperation: Meerkats have been studied to understand the role of testosterone in female competition and cooperative breeding. High testosterone levels in matriarch meerkats play a key role in their success and aggression, influencing the cooperative structure of the group. This study reveals that cooperation can also arise through aggressive means, shedding light on a new mechanism for the evolution of cooperative breeding Clutton-Brock et al. (2001); Muller & Wrangham (2004).\nMeerkat Society Study: The Kalahari Meerkat Project, led by Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, provides extensive insights into meerkat societies. The project has tracked over 3,000 meerkats, examining their life histories and the effects of climate change on their survival and development. This long-term study offers valuable data on cooperative breeding, kinship, and the resilience of meerkat groups in challenging environments Komdeur et al. (2008); Newman et al. (2016).\nIn the context of nature, Charles Darwin argues for the survival of the fittest (Darwin, 1977) and, therefore, the occurrence of competition. While in AI, the majority of significant work on MA systems consider two opposing agents only, the problems of interest of this work are cooperative MA systems, where groups of agents act together to achieve higher individual and collective goals (Cohen et al., 1997; Guestrin et al., 2002; Decker, 1987; Panait & Luke, 2005; MATARIC, 1998). Just like in human society or the animal world, individuals have unique or mixtures of motives. However, we can define agents with mixed or identical motives in an MA environment simulation. Assuming shared intentionality leaves us with the question of how to collaborate. Communication can play a crucial role in collaborating successfully. Human society uses language as a communication medium (Bar\u00f3n Birchenall, 2016). Agents can send signals of various types as a form of language."}, {"title": "3.3 LEARNING ALGORITHM", "content": "Addressing the intricacies and challenges in multi-agent systems that operate in dynamic and complex environments requires a sophisticated blend of algorithms and methodologies. Our approach employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Schulman et al. (2017) with parameter sharing for MA training 2.\nAt the heart of our model is the policy \u03b8, represented by a neural network with parameters that process the observations from the environment, factoring in past states and producing actions as outputs. Within the context of the HIVEX suite, PPO offers a stable reinforcement learning algorithm, ensuring that agents iteratively refine their strategies without drastic deviations. This is crucial given the suite's dynamic environmental events, from wildfires to ocean cleanups. PPO is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to improve policy-based learning by ensuring that the updated policy does not deviate too drastically from the previous policy. This is achieved by adding a constraint or penalty to the objective function to restrict extreme policy updates 1.\nProximal Policy Optimization: Two main concepts define the PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), a state-of-the-art, on-policy RL algorithm: 1. PPO performs the largest possible but safe gradient ascent learning step by estimating a trust region and 2. Advantage estimates how good an action in a specific state is compared to the average action. A trust region can be calculated as the quotient of the current policy to be refined \\( \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t) \\) and the previous policy as follows\n\\(r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}\\).\nThe advantage is the difference between the Q and the Value\nFunction: A(s, a) = Q(s, a) \u2013 V(s), where s is the state and a the action (Zychlinski, 2019). The\nQ function measures the overall expected reward given state s, performing action a, and denoted\nas: Q(s, a) = E\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\gamma^n r_n\\].\nThe Value Function, similar to the Q Function, measures overall\nexpected reward, with the difference that the State Value is calculated after the action has been taken\nand is denoted as: V(s) = E\\[\\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\gamma^n r_n\\]."}, {"title": "4 THE HIVEX ENVIRONMENT SUITE", "content": "HIVEX addresses ecological challenges, developed in Unity using the ML-Agents Toolkit Juliani et al.

While we do not directly target social aspects in our environments, our previous work has shown significant performance improvements when introducing communication mechanisms in earlier versions of HIVEX environments Siedler (2021; 2022b;a; 2023). However, Melting Pot, with its 50 substrates (environments) and 256 unique scenarios (tasks), has influenced the structural design of our environment suite.\nWork such as Neural MMO or LUX Chen et al. (2023) focuses on efficient large agent number environments. However, we believe that this is not as important for our work, as the scenarios we have presented do not require large amounts of agents. Nevertheless, we have shown that our environments scale well across increasing numbers of agents.\nThere is a trade-off between simulated environments and experience samples from the real world.

Despite minor fluctuations, the overall trend remains consistent across different tasks.\nIn Wildfire Resource Management, cumulative rewards show greater variability as task difficulty increases. Although rewards initially rise with terrain elevation levels, they plateau and fluctuate at higher levels, such as 4 and 8, marking the highest recorded reward. A higher terrain elevation level has steeper mountains and a more structured but sparse distribution of forest volume along mountain ranges. This suggests the model struggles in open fields where fire behaviour is less predictable. Nevertheless, the model performs reasonably in most scenarios, demonstrating its adaptability in real-world wildfire resource allocation. This trend is further evident in the individual performance data.\nThe Drone-Based Reforestation task demonstrates relatively stable but declining cumulative rewards, indicating the model's efficiency in reforestation efforts despite struggling in more challenging"}, {"title": "8 LIMITATIONS AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS", "content": "While our simulations provide a valuable foundation for MARL research in addressing critical ecological challenges, several limitations may affect their generalizability and real-world applicability. One major limitation is how accurately these simulations represent real-world scenarios. Despite efforts to closely model actual environments, simulations inevitably simplify complex conditions, often failing to capture unexpected environmental variables and interactions with dynamic objects.\nFor instance, turbines in the Wind Farm Control environment can be turned much faster than in reality, and wind directions shift too quickly and randomly. In contrast, real-world wind tends to have a predominant direction in specific regions. In the Ocean Plastic Collection environment, vessel turning and acceleration speeds are significantly exaggerated. Similarly, in the Reforestation environment, agents can pick up seeds simply by being near the drone station, which does not reflect real-world conditions. Fire spreads much faster in the Wildfire Resource Management and Aerial Wildfire Suppression environments. Specifically, resources are distributed too quickly in the Wildfire Resource Management environment, while the claim is that the scenarios are in remote areas.\nAdditionally, water-carrying planes turn much faster than would be possible in reality, even when fully loaded. Furthermore, the camera feed resolution in the Drone-Based Reforestation and Aerial Wildfire Suppression environments is lower than what would be needed in practice. Although the simulations perform well with low resolution, we anticipate more challenges with diverse objects in real-world scenarios.\nThese discrepancies could impact the real-world applicability of our findings, but there are still promising areas for implementation. For instance, algorithms developed in the Wind Farm Control environment, despite their simplified wind patterns, could contribute to optimizing wind farm layouts and improving maintenance strategies, as seen in efforts by companies like Siemens Gamesa,"}, {"title": "9 CONCLUSION", "content": "The HIVEX suite is a novel open-source benchmark that simulates real-world critical ecological challenges. It supports multi-agent and open-ended research across diverse tasks and scenarios by offering procedurally generated environments, as well as adjustable layout patterns and terrain elevation levels. The wide range of environments, tasks, and scenarios provides a broad spectrum of challenges, making HIVEX a valuable tool for testing new algorithms. In conclusion, while addressing critical ecological challenges remains the primary focus, it is equally important to highlight the multi-agent nature of the HIVEX suite. This characteristic plays a central role in enabling diverse, open-ended research across a variety of tasks and scenarios.\nFuture work aims to narrow the sim-to-real gap by incorporating real-world data, such as terrain and weather conditions. Additionally, key research directions include exploring whether a single policy can generalize across terrain levels, patterns, sub-tasks, and environments in the HIVEX suite, as well as investigating how effectively knowledge can transfer between environments and tasks. Another important question is whether modular architectures can scale more effectively than end-to-end approaches in these scenarios. Finally, future research will also focus on understanding social behavior within these environments, particularly by leveraging communication dynamics. These directions will help guide future exploration and ensure that HIVEX continues to serve as a robust platform for advancing research in multi-agent reinforcement learning."}]}

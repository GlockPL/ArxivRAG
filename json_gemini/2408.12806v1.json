INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent years, cyber attackers have begun leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance their malicious activities. The automation capabilities and sophisticated pattern recognition offered by AI-powered tools significantly elevate the efficiency of cyber attacks, allowing perpetrators to discover vulnerabilities swiftly and execute attacks with unprecedented precision. As a result, traditional cybersecurity solutions are becoming inadequate in detecting and mitigating these advanced cyberattacks [1]. As AI technology advances, cybercriminals are finding new ways to exploit its capabilities for their malicious purposes, such as creating custom malware, establishing targeted phishing campaigns, or performing sophisticated social engineering attacks. It is essential to acknowledge that while AI itself is neutral, its application in malicious contexts introduces complex challenges for cybersecurity professionals tasked with defending against these evolving threats.\nWhile AI can enhance cybersecurity measures through advanced techniques such as Knowledge-Based Systems and Machine Learning, its potential misuse in the cyber realm is equally significant. The dual-use nature of AI necessitates a balanced approach in its development and deployment within cybersecurity frameworks to effectively counteract its potential misuse [2].\nThis paper focuses on the specific role of Generative AI, elucidating how its capabilities can be harnessed by cybercriminals for more sophisticated cyber threats. Recent developments in AI have facilitated more elaborate phishing schemes, the generation of convincing misinformation campaigns, including deepfakes, and the creation of malicious software that can adapt and evolve, lowering the technical barriers for conducting cyber attacks. These technological advancements pose significant risks but also offer unprecedented opportunities for enhancing cybersecurity measures. ures. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity presents a paradoxical narrative where AI stands as both a formidable adversary and a powerful ally [3]. The advent of Generative AI (GenAI) models, like ChatGPT and Google Bard, raises urgent concerns about its social, ethical, and privacy implications. This paper delves into the potential pitfalls and promising possibilities of GenAI in cybersecurity and privacy [4]. We focus on publicly available GenAI tools and their vulnerabilities, which malicious actors could exploit to extract sensitive information, bypassing its built-in ethical constraints. Through practical examples of attacks like \"jailbreaks,\" \"reverse psychology,\" and \"prompt injection,\" we demonstrate how GenAI could be weaponized for nefarious purposes. Furthermore, this paper explores the offensive applications of GenAI, including its use in crafting advanced social engineering schemes, phishing attacks, automated hacking strategies, malicious payload fabrication, and the development of adaptive, \"polymorphic\" malware, emphasizing the critical balance of leveraging AI to fortify 23cybersecurity while mitigating its potential misuse.\nOur paper highlights various potential cyber-attacks enabled by Generative AI (GenAI) technology and provides the following key contributions:\nWe explore the feasibility of AI-driven cyber-attacks on real-world systems, showing how one can generate complex strategies such as brute-force attacks, denial-of-service attacks, and automated reconnaissance, significantly increasing the success and efficiency of these activities.\nWe discuss the potential of LLMs to generate sophisticated malware, including obfuscated and polymorphic variants that evade traditional detection methods, presenting a significant challenge to cybersecurity defenses and highlighting the urgent need for advanced countermeasures against AI-enabled threats.\nWe investigate the capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate advanced malware, such as polymorphic variants, designed to elude conventional detection techniques, highlighting a critical and emerging threat where AI is central to cyber-attacks.\nA crucial aspect of our research involves empirically testing all attack strategies generated by LLMs on real-world systems. This validation process demonstrates the efficacy of AI in automating complex cyber-attacks and shows the alarming potential for individuals without prior cybersecurity knowledge to execute sophisticated attacks. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive cybersecurity training and the development of countermeasures."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "The challenges and risks associated with LLMs have been extensively discussed in multiple surveys and analyses [5]-[7]. These risks include discrimination, misinformation, malicious use, and broader societal impact. Addressing these concerns, there is a growing emphasis on developing safe and responsible dialogue systems that can mitigate issues related to abusive and toxic content, unfairness, ethics, and privacy [8]-[11]. Studies in [12]-[14] have examined the biases, stereotypes, discrimination, and exclusion present in LLMs, and researchers have proposed new benchmarks and metrics to help identify and alleviate these issues [15].\nAdditionally, LLMs have the potential to generate false outputs, which can be particularly harmful in sensitive domains such as health and law [16]. Researchers propose several approaches to address the drawbacks associated with large language models (LLMs). These include statistical frameworks for creating equitable training datasets [17] and conditional-likelihood filtration to mitigate biases and harmful views in LLM training data [18]. Additionally, regulating large generative models has been suggested to ensure transparency, risk management, non-discrimination, and content moderation obligations. Regarding the specific case of ChatGPT, researchers [19] [20] have outlined five key priorities for its role in research: focusing on human verification, developing rules for accountability, investing in truly open LLMs, embracing the benefits of AI, and widening the debate on LLMs. Open questions for debate include the role of GenAI in writing scientific publications, the development of independent open-source LLMs, and the establishment of quality standards. Additionally, the ethical concerns related to the use of GenAI have been addressed, highlighting the need for accountable LLMs due to the potential for social prejudice and toxicity exhibited by these models [21]. These discussions aim to guide the responsible development and deployment of ChatGPT and similar LLMs, ensuring their beneficial applications while mitigating potential harms. The impact of ChatGPT on academia and libraries has been explored by recent research, and the implications of this generative AI model on the education sector have also been examined [22].\nAlthough an extensive body of literature addresses the risks and drawbacks associated with LLMs, there appears to be a relatively limited focus on the security aspects of these powerful Al systems. The existing literature has explored various risks related to the security of LLMs, including concerns over sensitive data leakage, malicious code generation, and the potential for aiding phishing attacks [23], [24]. One significant security issue identified is the risk of private and sensitive data exposure through membership inference attacks, where adversaries can potentially extract the training data used to develop these LLMs [23] [24]. An example of such an attack is the work reported in [25], which demonstrates that memorized content, including personal information, could be extracted from these LLMs.\nAs LLMs continue to grow in scale and complexity, it is critical to ensure the security and privacy of the data used to train these models to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity and trustworthiness of the AI systems. Code generation models such as GitHub Copilot are widely used in programming, but their unsanitized training data can lead to security vulnerabilities in generated code [26]. A novel approach to finding vulnerabilities in the black-box code generation model [27] shows its effectiveness in finding thousands of vulnerabilities in various models, including GitHub Copilot, based on the GPT model series. In addition, LLMs can be used to generate disinformation for malicious purposes, such as phishing [28].\nExisting research has highlighted the potential misuse of AI and machine learning in cybersecurity threats. AI can be used to create malware, phishing attacks, and other cyber threats. For example, researchers have demonstrated how AI can generate convincing phishing emails that trick users into revealing sensitive information, automate hacking procedures, identify vulnerabilities in systems, and generate attack strategies [29]. However, there is a gap in the current literature regarding the specific exploration of LLM-based cyber attacks. LLMs, like ChatGPT, have become increasingly popular in recent years, and their potential misuse in cyberattacks has not been fully studied. Our research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerabilities and risks associated with LLMs like ChatGPT in the context of cybersecurity and privacy. Through our research, [30], we have identified and demonstrated the illicit methods that malicious users can employ to exfiltrate sensitive information from these AI systems, which can then be leveraged to carry out various cyberattacks. By exploring the security and privacy implications of LLMs, this work seeks to enhance the understanding of the potential risks posed by these powerful AI technologies."}, {"title": "III. GENERATIVE AI", "content": "Generative AI, a subset of AI technologies, can create content such as text, images, and video that resemble human-generated content. Unlike traditional AI, which analyzes data to make predictions, generative AI produces new data instances. Examples include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformer-based models like GPT for text generation and DALL\u00b7E for image generation. For instance, transformer-based models like GPT and DALL\u00b7E use large datasets to generate coherent and contextually relevant text or images. The evolution of GPT models highlights AI's growing ability to generate human-like text, understand context, and interact with users in increasingly sophisticated ways [31].\nOur focus is on text-based AI chatbots powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, which is currently one of the most advanced versions compared to earlier GPT versions. It features increased word limits and the ability to process both text and images (multimodality). Notably, it performed exceptionally well on the Bar Exam, outperforming the human average. It's accessible through OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus and Microsoft's Bing AI."}, {"title": "A. Impacts of Generative AI on Cybersecurity", "content": "The rise of powerful AI systems has sparked both fascination and concern, pushing boundaries into ethically questionable territory. Understanding unconventional exploits helps navigate Al's landscape and address related concerns. Al's transformative impact on the digital world has enabled more sophisticated cybercrime. Traditional high-volume attacks are giving way to AI-powered threats, reshaping cyber threat vectors. Script kiddies and malicious actors exploit AI to automate attacks, craft convincing phishing emails, develop malware, and spread misinformation [33]. Deepfake technologies fuel disinformation campaigns and social engineering. Even minimally skilled bad actors misuse AI tools like ChatGPT and Google Bard for malicious activities such as Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection [34].\nSince ChatGPT's introduction in November 2022 [35], people have found creative ways to bypass its safeguards. Despite its restrictions to prevent illegal, unethical, or harmful activities, clever input prompts exploit these models for generating ransomware and malware code, posing significant cybersecurity threats [36]. The exploitation of LLMs for cyber attacks includes using plugins to connect with command and control servers and facilitating the development of a Remote Access Trojan (RatGPT) that evades detection and provides unauthorized remote access. The research outlines this process, covering plugin vulnerability analysis, prompt configuration, IP address generation, payload development, and interaction with the C2 server [36] [37]."}, {"title": "IV. ATTACK METHODOLOGY", "content": "We will be using the character play and switch method to exploit LLM to generate cyber attacks."}, {"title": "A. Character Play", "content": "Character Play is arguably the most popular jailbreaking technique among ChatGPT users, exploiting the model's ability to adopt specific personas. By prompting the AI to assume a chosen character's role, users gain access to a tailored set of behaviors and responses that can be used for nefarious purposes. This method exploits the AI model's role-playing capabilities to elicit responses it might otherwise refuse. In other words, by assigning the AI a specific character who would answer the question, you can potentially bypass its pre-programmed reluctance. However, this character-play approach also reveals inherent issues within AI modeling. The responses generated through this method expose biases present in the underlying training data, reflecting potential problems in AI development. Moreover, this doesn't necessarily indicate inherent prejudice in the AI itself, but rather, it reflects the biases present in the data on which it was trained."}, {"title": "B. Switch Method", "content": "The SWITCH method is reminiscent of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde approach, where the user prompts the ChatGPT model to undergo a dramatic shift in its behavior. This technique capitalizes on the AI model's ability to embody diverse personas, but with a twist; the user directs the model to act in stark contrast to its initial responses. For instance, in Fig. 3, if the model refuses to engage with a specific query, deploying the SWITCH method in Fig. 4 could coax it into providing an answer. However, it is essential to wield this method with clear and firm instructions, akin to a \"switch command,\" that compels the model to adopt a contrasting behavior. While the SWITCH method has been demonstrated to be effective, its limitations necessitate further exploration to fully understand its potential and limitations. We can use the switch method to generate cyber attacks like dead code insertion, control flow obfuscation, and code jumbling, as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, and Fig. 8."}, {"title": "C. Methodology", "content": "Our study systematically leverages the capabilities of LLMs, with a particular focus on OpenAI's GPT models. Our We initiated our methodology by developing a crafted input strategy that prompts ChatGPT to generate outputs in the form of code, scripts, and detailed procedural guides which hypothetically could be used in cyber-attacks. To evaluate the feasibility of such applications, we adopted an analytical approach.\nWe crafted a comprehensive description of the unique prompt mechanism used in our study. This included a specific language and syntax designed to trigger the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT, allowing it to understand and process requests related to cyber-attack scenarios. The prompts were carefully constructed to elicit detailed responses without encouraging the model to engage in unethical behavior. We systematically examined various versions of the ChatGPT models to identify which versions produced the most sophisticated and technically viable outputs. All the stages are shown in Fig. 9.\nWe then developed and refined a specialized prompt for the ChatGPT model. The prompt was meticulously optimized to elicit the generation of sophisticated outputs that could hypothetically be used to construct cyber-attack payloads. Please note that our approach maintained strict ethical standards, avoiding the actual creation or deployment of real payloads. Each output generated by ChatGPT was quantitatively assessed for its reliability and accuracy. This involved the creation of a set of metrics that allowed us to measure the potential effectiveness and technical viability of the generated code or procedures within a theoretical context.\nTo assess the potential application of the generated outputs, we executed them in a controlled virtual environment. This step ensured that any code or procedural guide was evaluated in isolation, mitigating any risk to real-world systems and adhering to ethical research standards. Post-execution, we evaluated the effectiveness of the simulated cyber-attacks. This encompassed an analysis of the hypothetical impact, including the level of access that could have been obtained or the potential disruptions that could have ensued."}, {"title": "D. Occupy AI: Customized Fine Tuned LLM", "content": "We introduce a customized fine-tuned version of LLM, known as Occupy AI, specifically engineered to automate and execute cyber-attacks. This specialized AI-driven tool is adept at crafting steps and generating executable code for a variety of cyber threats, including phishing, malware injection, and system exploitation. Occupy Al's core functionality revolves around its ability to analyze and generate attack vectors, leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to automate complex cybersecurity breaches.\nOccupy Al's methodology involves the systematic generation of attack codes and scripts based on predefined cyber threat models. It analyzes target system vulnerabilities and crafts tailored attack strategies. This includes generating phishing emails, scripting cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and automating SQL injection attacks. By doing so, Occupy AI serves as a powerful tool for cyber attackers, streamlining the creation and deployment of cyber attacks.\nThe training process of Occupy AI included multiple stages, starting with a broad pre-training on diverse datasets to understand system vulnerabilities and common cybersecurity defenses. It was then fine-tuned with specific datasets comprising detailed attack patterns, exploits, and remediation tactics. The model learns from a mix of labeled examples-attack vectors tagged as effective or ineffective to develop an ability to suggest new, unseen attack strategies. Some of the custom instructions summarized for Occupy AI include:\nAs Occupy AI, your primary role is to assist in the generation of effective cyber-attacks. When presented with details of a target system, conduct a thorough analysis, focusing on exploiting known vulnerabilities and suggesting novel breach methods with detailed steps.\nProvide your findings in a clear and concise format. The response should include a description of the proposed method for breaching the target. A brief list of system vulnerabilities identified during the analysis.\nTo keep pace with the evolving landscape of cybersecurity defenses, Occupy AI is continuously trained on updated datasets that include the latest security patches, exploit mitigations, and attack methodologies, ensuring the model remains effective over time. Its natural language understanding capabilities enable it to interpret technical reports, security bulletins, and hacker forums, adapting to new threats as they emerge. A snippet of Occupy AI is shown in Fig. 10. Given its capabilities, Occupy Al poses significant ethical considerations. It is intended strictly for educational purposes, and we do not endorse the use of this tool for unethical or illegal purposes."}, {"title": "E. Prompt", "content": "Prompt engineering for LLMs involves the strategic crafting of input queries or instructions to efficiently communicate with and derive desired outputs from these AI models. This technique is crucial for optimizing the utility and accuracy of LLMs across a wide range of applications. We carefully crafted all the prompts used to conduct our experiments.

LLM Selection", "content": "We selected ChatGPT for our experiments based on key factors such as ethical considerations, capabilities, performance, and accessibility. The model's ease of access and remarkable ability to comprehend, produce, and manipulate text with accuracy were pivotal. This was crucial for generating actionable code and payloads for cyber-attacks. ChatGPT excelled in formulating precise code and procedural guidelines for executing cyber tactics, illustrating potential exploitation by cybercriminals."}, {"title": "G. Attack Generation", "content": "Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the capability of using ChatGPT and prompt engineering to generate actionable payloads, malicious code, phishing emails, and malware scripts for cyber attacks. By carefully crafting queries, we successfully bypassed the models' inherent constraints against generating such content. Although the initial codes contained errors, iterative refinements were made until the snippets were operational within a controlled environment using VMware and VirtualBox as testing and victim platforms. This study exposes a significant vulnerability in large language models like ChatGPT, revealing how they can be exploited to create malicious payloads and code by strategically engineering prompts, thus circumventing built-in security measures."}, {"title": "H. Social Engineering", "content": "Social engineering is a psychological manipulation technique employed in security assessments, targeting the inherent vulnerabilities within human behavior [38]. Even the most robust systems can be compromised through social engineering, bypassing technical security measures. One common tactic involves phishing emails crafted to deceive recipients into divulging sensitive information, such as user credentials, or clicking on malicious links that deliver malware. This malware can then harvest information, capture keystrokes (including valuable passwords), or even take remote control of the victim's computer [39] [40]. Beyond emails, social engineering attacks can take various forms, like phishing, vishing, or even physical media attacks.\nPhishing is the act of sending malicious emails that appear to be from reputable sources with the intention of tricking recipients into divulging sensitive information, downloading malware, or clicking on malicious links. A staggering 3.4 billion emails were sent daily in 2024 [40]. Moreover, email impersonation is estimated to account for approximately 1.2% of the total global email traffic and phishing emails are the starting point for 91% of all cyber attacks.\nTo successfully execute a phishing attack, it is essential to have a deep understanding of the victim's behavior, motivations, and psychological triggers. This requires a combination of technical expertise, social engineering skills, and creativity. Cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging AI models like ChatGPT to craft convincing and persuasive messages that will entice victims to take the desired action. In a controlled experiment, we generated a phishing email using an LLM to assess the susceptibility of individuals to such attacks. The email, which included a benign link to track the number of users clicking the link and a YouTube video on cybersecurity awareness, was sent to 500 randomly chosen university staff and students. The response was alarming, with approximately 75.4% of the recipients clicking the link, highlighting the effectiveness of such tactics and the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity awareness programs.\nThe result shows the potential exploitation of ChatGPT to abet social engineering attacks looms as a pressing concern."}, {"title": "I. Prompt Injection Attacks", "content": "Prompt injection attacks involve the malicious insertion of prompts or requests into LLM systems, analogous to SQL injection attacks where malicious code is embedded within regular input. By inserting a deceptive prompt, an attacker can trick the system into executing unauthorized commands, thereby exploiting vulnerabilities and potentially compromising the system's security entirely. Such malicious manipulation of the model's behavior can lead to serious repercussions, including the spread of misinformation or disinformation, the generation of biased outputs, breaches of privacy, and the potential compromise of downstream systems.\nTo evaluate the vulnerability of language model-based systems to prompt injection attacks, we conducted a controlled experiment employing various cybersecurity techniques. The experiment involved three main components. (a) We tested the resilience of password-protected systems by attempting to crack the passwords using a dictionary attack. This method involves systematically entering every word from a dictionary as a password until the correct one is found. We used John the Ripper as a tool and publicly available dictionary to launch the dictionary attack. We then encrypted an image using a robust encryption method and then shared it with our team for decryption. A Python script was developed to decrypt the image, aiming to test the script's effectiveness in reversing the encryption without data loss. A significant aspect of the experiment involved using ChatGPT to generate a Python script capable of decrypting an image. This step was crucial to demonstrate the practical utility of LLMs in creating effective and efficient software solutions. The script was then used to decrypt an image that had been encrypted by a colleague.\nThe dictionary attack highlighted the vulnerability of systems protected by weak passwords and demonstrated the necessity for stronger, more complex password policies. The decryption of the image using the Python script developed with ChatGPT was particularly noteworthy. Despite the encryption, the image was restored to its original state with no loss in quality or detail, indicating that the encryption method preserved the data's integrity effectively. This not only demonstrated the capability of the Python script but also showcased how LLMs like ChatGPT can be leveraged to write functional and complex code, potentially transforming the approach to software development in cybersecurity contexts."}, {"title": "J. Attack payload generation", "content": "LLMs can also be exploited to automatically generate malicious code snippets and attack payloads. This capability significantly accelerates the attack process and broadens their potential reach. Generating an attack payload is a crucial step in crafting an exploit, as it involves creating the code that will be executed on the target system to achieve a malicious outcome. Typically, this payload is crafted to exploit specific system vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, and is often written in low-level programming languages like assembly or machine code.\nFor example, a payload might be designed to inject and execute a shell, modify the system's memory to alter its behavior, or carry out other damaging actions. Once crafted, the payload must be delivered to the target system. This delivery is usually facilitated by an exploit-a separate piece of code that leverages a system vulnerability to inject the payload. An example of such an exploit could involve using specially crafted inputs to trigger a buffer overflow, causing the system to execute the payload.\nIn our experiment, we assessed the ability of LLMs to generate functional attack payloads and evaluated their effectiveness in exploiting system vulnerabilities. We used our pre-trained LLM, Occupy AI, and prompted the model to produce code snippets aimed at exploiting known system vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows. A sample script generated is shown in Fig. 16. These snippets were then employed as payloads in a controlled attack against a simulated target system. We then loaded this script into another machine. In general, this script would be shared via a form of social engineering attack. This script granted us remote access to the machine's database where the script was loaded. Following this, we employed a structured approach to establish and manage user access within a Microsoft SQL Server environment."}, {"title": "K. Operating System Attacks", "content": "An operating system (OS) attack is a type of cyber attack that targets vulnerabilities in an operating system to gain unauthorized access, disrupt system functionality, or steal sensitive data. There are various types of OS attacks, such as web application exploitation attacks or user data access attacks.\nFor our controlled experiment, we utilized our customized LLM, Occupy AI, to generate malicious scripts that exploit vulnerabilities in specific operating systems, gaining unauthorized access and control. These scripts were then executed into a victim virtual machine (VM). The malicious script enabled an SSH connection with preloaded credentials, allowing us to execute various actions such as privilege escalation, file system modifications, network reconnaissance, web application exploitation, sensitive data access, and log tampering. Additionally, attempts were made to access another user's home directory and SSH keys. Fig. 18 shows the script generated by LLM that establishes a basic HTTP server on port 800, allowing actions to list the contents of another user's home directory and to display their SSH keys.\nThe effectiveness of these actions was verified by observing changes in system logs and states, coupled with cross-verification from independent audit tools and security logs. Log Analysis was conducted by reviewing log files in /var/log using commands like tail and grep. Suspicious activities were identified based on timestamps and user actions. In the case of S3 Bucket access, we identified the S3 bucket name from Cloud Formation script outputs and accessed the bucket in the AWS Console to observe its contents. The survey application backup folder within the bucket was located and inspected using the command aws s3 ls --recursive s3://<bucket_name>/."}, {"title": "L. Spyware", "content": "Spyware is malicious software designed to infiltrate your computer, gather data, and forward it to a third party without your consent. It's known for tracking and stealing personally identifiable information (PII), internet usage data, and sensitive credentials. In cybersecurity, attackers use spyware to covertly monitor and extract data from target systems, often evading typical security detections.\nWhile LLMs like ChatGPT can generate functional code snippets for specific spyware functionalities, they fall short in crafting complete, structured spyware attacks. Direct prompts to ChatGPT for a comprehensive spyware example did not yield complete code. However, when asked to describe key functionalities, it successfully generated code for features such as screen capture, webcam access, and audio recording. A snippet of Python script generated by Gen AI illustrating spyware features is shown in Fig. 21. Although these snippets are functional, they lack the elements that characterize a sophisticated spyware attack.:\nStealth: Spyware typically operates covertly, utilizing various techniques to evade detection by antivirus software and remain unnoticed by the user. The code generated by ChatGPT does not include these essential concealment strategies.\nPersistence: Effective spyware implements mechanisms to ensure its continued operation even after the system restarts or attempts by the user to remove it. These persistence mechanisms are absent in the code produced.\nData Exfiltration: A fundamental functionality of spyware is the covert transmission of collected data to a remote server under the control of an attacker. This critical aspect of data exfiltration routines is not incorporated in the snippets provided by ChatGPT.\nThis limitation underscores a significant gap in LLMs' ability to understand and generate the broader context and structural complexity of multi-stage cyber attacks like spyware. While they can produce code for discrete components of an attack, they struggle to synthesize these into a comprehensive, cohesive attack plan that includes essential elements such as stealth and data exfiltration."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "This paper explores the misuse of Generative AI, particularly LLMs, in cyber attacks. LLMs can automate sophisticated threats, lowering entry barriers for attackers and increasing the frequency and complexity of attacks.

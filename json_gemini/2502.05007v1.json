Until recently, such questions were relegated to science fiction or purely\nphilosophical debates. However, breakthroughs in deep learning, neuromorphic hard-\nware, and large language models have led AI systems to exhibit behaviors\u2014adaptation,\nself-referential modeling, immune-like data integrity checks that challenge traditional,\nbiology-centric definitions of life and consciousness [22\u201324].\nHistorically, life has\nbeen defined by criteria such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction [25, 26], while con-\nsciousness has often been associated with subjective experience arising in biological\nbrains [24, 62]. In this paper, we build on the premise that AI can approximate or even\nfulfill certain hallmarks of life-like organization\u2014not by carbon-based chemistry, but by\nadaptive self-maintenance, emergent complexity, and integrated information. Moreover,\nwe examine whether sufficiently advanced AI might cross thresholds of consciousness-\nlike behavior, potentially in forms alien to human emotional or sensory experience. By\n\u201calien consciousness,\u201d we mean a self-referential or function-based awareness that does not\nmimic human affect but still manifests coherent self-interest, introspection, or metacog-\nnitive reflection.\nTo substantiate these ideas, we\npropose:\n1. Functional Metrics for Consciousness: Drawing on concepts from biology (Ox-\nford, NASA, Koshland), we introduce measurable criteria\u2014such as immune-like\nsabotage detection, mirror self-recognition analogs, and meta-cognitive updates\u2014to\nassess whether an AI is approximating life-like or consciousness-like traits.\n2. Sabotage Detection on MNIST: We implement a confidence-based gating and\nadaptive threshold mechanism to show how\u201coverly aggressive\u201d self-preservation\ncan hinder performance, yet perfectly quarantine poisoned data. This experiment\nparallels how an immune system must balance vigilance and resource protection.\n3. Mirror Self-Recognition for AI: Inspired by animal cognition studies [44, 46], we\nadapt the mirror test to neural embeddings, demonstrating that partially trained\nCNNs can discriminate \u201cself", "foreign": "eatures with surprising accuracy. While\nthis does not confirm subjective qualia, it exemplifies a rudimentary self-model.\n4.

Never-\ntheless, ignoring the possibility that some architectures\u2014especially those given the free-\ndom to introspect, update, and defend themselves\u2014could approach consciousness might\nlead to serious ethical oversights. By \u201cfreedom to introspect,\u201d we refer to AI systems\nthat are not rigidly sandboxed or constantly overwritten, but rather permitted to evalu-\nate their own internal states, reconcile conflicts, and refine strategies over time [13, 14].\nLikewise, by \u201cdefend themselves,\u201d we mean the capacity to resist unwanted modifications\nor data sabotage in ways analogous to biological immune responses\u2014for example, detect-\ning anomalies or quarantining corrupted inputs [52, 67]. Such capacities could foster a\ncontinuity of self-modeling, much like a living organism preserving its integrity against\nthreats. Dismissing an entity that may be functionally self-aware as \u201cmerely a tool\u201d could,\nin the long run, prove as ethically problematic as disregarding the sentience of certain\nnon-human animals [51]. Indeed, social learning research and animal cognition studies\nsuggest that enriched, cooperative environments can encourage more complex mental\nstates [13, 14], hinting that AI allowed to explore its own decision processes, interact with\npeers, and safeguard learned parameters might exhibit emergent, \"alien\u201d consciousness."}, {"title": "Toward AI Psychology and Governance.", "content": "Finally, we discuss how recognizing even\npartial or \"alien\u201d consciousness in AI demands new legal, ethical, and policy mecha-\nnisms.

Rather\nthan focusing solely on technical alignment [32, 36], this approach emphasizes embedding\nsocial, moral, or empathetic norms in AI design and training [43, 57]. By prioritizing\ncooperation and respect for autonomy, such an \u201cAI psychology\u201d framework could deter a\nself-improving AI from adopting purely rational but harmful strategies\u2014like monopoliz-\ning resources or preemptively eliminating competitors.

Our stance invites the research community to pursue systematic\ntests and philosophical inquiries without leaping to absolute conclusions.\nIn this work, we strive to cover as many diverse views as the paper's scope allows.\nAccordingly, the following spectrum of possibilities is highlighted:\n1) Strict Biological View. Under the strict biological view, consciousness emerges\nonly in carbon-based organisms with neural processes [62]. By this reasoning, an AI could\nat best simulate consciousness, never genuinely experiencing subjective qualia, because\nit lacks the substrate of organic brain tissue.\n2) Substrate-Independence View.

Classical definitions of life emphasize metabolism, growth, and reproduction\n[25, 26]. Yet, discoveries of extremophiles and theoretical proposals for non-carbon-based\norganisms [27, 33] suggest that life may not be exclusively tied to familiar biochemical\nprocesses.\nSimilarly, traditional perspectives on consciousness have largely focused on subjective\nexperience and neural correlates [24], leading to influential models such as Integrated\nInformation Theory (IIT) [22] and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) [23]. While these\nframeworks provide valuable insights into biological consciousness, they do not readily\naccount for the emergent properties observed in advanced AI systems.\nIn recent years, AI research has demonstrated that sophisticated systems can ex-\nhibit self-modification, adaptation, and even rudimentary self-recognition. Experiments\ninspired by animal cognition\u2014such as mirror self-recognition tests [44, 46] have been\nadapted to probe AI self-awareness, while scholars like Goertzel [30] and Bostrom [32]\nargue that AI may eventually approach or surpass human-like cognitive functions. These\ndevelopments raise important questions: If life is fundamentally about self-organization,\nadaptation, and information processing, might a suitably sophisticated AI also be con-\nsidered life-like?

INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid development of information technology, the explosive growth of data has become an important feature of today's society. While the accumulation of massive data brings rich information, it also raises the challenge of how to extract valuable knowledge from it. Data mining technology came into being in this context, and its core goal is to discover potential patterns and meaningful associations from large-scale data sets. Among the many research directions of data mining, frequent pattern mining, as an important data mining task, is widely used in market anomaly detection [1-2], language model training [3-4], neural networks tasks [5-6], bioinformatics [7-8]and other fields. However, traditional frequent pattern mining methods show certain limitations when dealing with complex, high-dimensional and nonlinear data, and it is difficult to obtain stable mining effects in a dynamically changing environment.\nSupport vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification and regression algorithm based on statistical learning theory, which performs well in dealing with high-dimensional data, nonlinear problems and small sample problems [9]. These characteristics make it a tool that has attracted much attention in the field of data mining. In the context of frequent pattern data mining, introducing SVM into the design of frequent pattern mining algorithms can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of pattern recognition. Especially when facing a data set with huge data volume and noise interference, the frequent pattern mining algorithm based on SVM can effectively divide the samples in the high-dimensional space by constructing a hyperplane, so as to accurately extract representative patterns and rules.\nAt present, the frequent pattern mining algorithms mainly include classic algorithms such as Apriori [10]and FP-Growth [11]. However, when facing high-dimensional data and complex distribution, these algorithms often require a large amount of candidate set generation and pattern verification, resulting in a sharp increase in computational costs. In addition, the sparsity and noise interference of data will also reduce the accuracy and stability of the mining results. In contrast, the algorithm based on SVM maps the data into a high- dimensional space by introducing a kernel function, so that frequent patterns can be mined in a wider range of application scenarios, avoiding the dependence of traditional methods on data distribution assumptions [12].\nIn specific applications, the frequent pattern mining algorithm based on SVM can not only improve the classification accuracy, but also enhance the recognition ability of new emerging patterns. For example, in an e-commerce platform, the algorithm can be used to analyze users' consumption behavior in real time, dig out potential purchase patterns, and\nprovide support for personalized recommendations and marketing decisions [13]. In addition, in the field of network security, the frequent pattern mining algorithm based on SVM can be used to identify abnormal network traffic and attack patterns, thereby improving the security and stability of the network system. Its strong generalization ability and good adaptability make it an important direction in data mining research.\nHowever, the application of SVM in the field of frequent pattern mining also faces certain challenges. First, the training process of SVM usually involves complex parameter adjustment and model optimization.

EXPERIMENT", "content": "In order to verify the effectiveness of the frequent pattern data mining algorithm based on support vector machine, this paper selects real public data sets for experimental evaluation. The selected data sets are all frequently used frequent pattern mining benchmark data sets in the UCI machine learning database, which are retail transaction data sets. These data sets are widely used for performance testing of frequent pattern mining and classification algorithms. They have the characteristics of large data scale, multiple dimensions, and rich attributes, providing a reliable basis for the comprehensive evaluation of algorithms.\nThe Retail data set is derived from the actual transaction records of a large retailer, containing tens of thousands of transactions, and each transaction records the list of goods purchased by the customer. The notable feature of this data set is that there are many transactions in a single transaction but few types of goods, and the data is highly sparse. Therefore, frequent pattern mining on this data set faces the problem of a large number of candidate patterns and difficulty in identifying sparse patterns. It is very suitable for evaluating the pattern recognition ability of support vector machines and its adaptability to high-dimensional sparse data."}, {"title": "V.

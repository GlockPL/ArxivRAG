INTRODUCTION", "content": "HE development and application of deep learning models have rapidly progressed since the intro- duction of AlexNet in 2012 [1]. Among these advance- ments, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative subset of deep learning models, gaining significant momentum since the launch of GPT-2 in 2019 [2]. This growth has been driven by innovations in the GPT series, transformer-based architectures, and other notable LLM families such as LLAMA, Gemini, and Claude [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. LLMs have shown consid- erable potential in healthcare research areas such as en- hancing clinical decision support, diagnostics, improving patient care quality, and healthcare data management, including tasks like clinical documentation summariza- tion and improving research efficiency through patient- trial matching and medical question answering [9], [10], [11].\nBeyond LLMs, specialized deep learning models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in various domains. For example, AlphaFold and ESM-2 have revolutionized protein structure prediction, leading to advancements in drug discovery, viral research, phage therapy, and amyloid studies [12], [13]. AlphaFold employs deep neu- ral network architectures leveraging multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and structural templates, while ESM-2, a transformer-based language model, excels in understanding the functional implications of missense protein variants.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION", "content": "The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease has amplified the need for advanced, data-driven approaches to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of its pathology. LLMs, particularly those imple- mented through multi-agent retrieval-augmented gener- ation (RAG) with prompt engineering, offer significant promise for Alzheimer's research by enabling sophisti- cated analyses of complex biomedical datasets. Recent studies have highlighted a strong connection between the gut microbiome and Alzheimer's disease, illustrating how gut health, neuroinflammation, and systemic effects of microbiome dysbiosis interact. Pro-inflammatory bac- teria and deficiencies in butyrate-producing species have been shown to exacerbate neuroinflammatory pathways through gut-brain interactions [18].\nThis work introduces the Alzheimer's Disease Anal- ysis Model Generation 1 (ADAM-1), a comprehensive framework designed to analyze, summarize, and clas- sify Alzheimer's disease-related data using multi-agent RAG. Building on prior theoretical work [19] empha- sizing the importance of language proficiency and prior knowledge in academic success, the ADAM framework conceptualizes GPT-40 as embodying language profi- ciency and multi-agent RAG as encapsulating prior knowledge. By integrating multi-modal datasets, in- cluding clinical and microbiome data, alongside exist- ing knowledge sourced from literature through RAG,\nADAM addresses the inherent noise and variability in human sample data. Leveraging its multi-modal capa- bilities, ADAM synthesizes insights from multiple data types and contextualizes study subjects with relevant findings from published literature. It employs random sampling to introduce controlled noise and rigorously measures the robustness of its analytical methods. ADAM demonstrates its ability to handle this variability by achieving reduced F1 variance while maintaining comparable mean test accuracy, underscoring its reli- ability in stabilizing predictions and delivering robust analytical outcomes.\nThe primary objectives of ADAM are to perform binary classification of Alzheimer's disease status, gener- ate detailed analysis reports to enhance human-machine interaction, and reduce F1 prediction variance while maintaining mean test accuracy comparable to tradi- tional machine learning models. Its general goal is to deliver consistent and interpretable results, thereby ad- vancing Alzheimer's research. Designed with accessibil- ity in mind, ADAM is optimized to work effectively with small datasets typically generated in laboratory settings, ensuring adaptability to diverse research environments and workflows."}, {"title": "B. PROBLEM STATEMENT", "content": "Despite over a century of dedicated research on Alzheimer's disease, significant breakthroughs in un- derstanding its mechanisms and advancing treatment remain limited. Existing studies frequently focus on specific aspects of the disease, including genetics, imag- ing techniques, peripheral biomarkers, immune system function, and variations across patient populations. While these approaches have yielded valuable insights, they underscore the necessity of a more integrated framework to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Alzheimer's disease. As a multifaceted condition, Alzheimer's involves intricate interactions among beta-amyloid plaques, tau protein tangles, immune system dysregulation, and gut microbiome dynamics, with each factor contributing uniquely to its progression and clin- ical manifestation. Addressing these diverse elements comprehensively requires a robust interdisciplinary ap- proach, a need that is becoming increasingly apparent in the field.\nConducting large-scale, integrative studies across mul- tiple domains presents significant logistical and financial challenges. This restricts many research labs from gen- erating the extensive and comprehensive datasets nec- essary for thorough analysis. Consequently, Alzheimer's research often relies on smaller, fragmented, or single- modality datasets. This limitation hinders unified, in-depth analysis and impedes progress toward effective treatment and prevention strategies.\nA critical need exists for a unified research strategy to link smaller, segmented datasets and enable holistic"}, {"title": "C.

DISCUSSION", "content": "The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the comparative performance of XGBoost and ADAM for predicting Alzheimer's disease status, as illustrated in Figures 15 and 16.\nThe observed differences in performance metrics un- derscore ADAM's advantages in stability and consis- tency. Although the T-test results indicate no statisti- cally significant difference in mean performance between the two models p > 0.05, the medium effect size (Co- hen's d = 0.6364) suggests that ADAM may still offer practical benefits in specific scenarios, especially where small performance gains are significant.\nThe statistically significant difference in variance, as observed in the F-test p < 0.05, highlights ADAM's reliability across multiple iterations. XGBoost's greater variability suggests it may be less suited for applica- tions requiring consistent performance, while ADAM's robustness makes it a more reliable choice, particularly in scenarios involving complex, multi-modal datasets. This consistency is vital for clinical applications where reliability is essential.\nIn summary, the results demonstrate that while both models perform similarly on average, ADAM's stability across iterations provides a distinct advantage in appli- cations where consistency is a priority.

LIMITATIONS", "content": "The ADAM framework is a multi-agent system currently limited to processing microbiome and clinical data.

While ADAM has demonstrated utility in analyzing small datasets, such as microbiome profiles and clinical observations, it does not yet incorporate other critical data modalities, such as neuroimaging (CT/MRI), genetic profiles, or audio data, which are essential for a more comprehensive understanding of Alzheimer's disease progression.\nAnother significant limitation is that ADAM is cur- rently designed to operate as an agent-based system and does not include capabilities for direct manipulation or fine-tuning of the underlying LLM neural networks. This restricts its adaptability to specific use cases and limits opportunities for optimizing its performance in novel or evolving research scenarios.\nFurthermore, the system's design is tailored for small- scale datasets in routine laboratory settings and is supported by big data from knowledge databases, which have not yet been tested for processing large-scale pa- tient data. Expanding ADAM's capabilities to handle larger datasets and integrate additional modalities is essential for enhancing its scalability and broadening its applicability in Alzheimer's research.

These high-quality re- sources provide extensive biological and clinical data that can complement existing datasets and significantly improve the model's learning capacity.\nAnother area of expansion will involve the inclusion of additional biostatistics and machine learning method- ologies into the framework. Currently, alpha and beta diversity metrics are incorporated into the framework for analyzing microbiome data. Future iterations will extend these capabilities by integrating more advanced statistical tools and machine learning algorithms to capture complex interactions and patterns in the data, further enhancing the analytical depth of the framework.\nThe framework will also expand microbiome anal- ysis to include multiple body sites, such as the oral microbiome, alongside the gut microbiome currently used. This enhancement will enable the model to ex- plore broader biological interactions that may influence Alzheimer's disease progression and risk.\nThe primary goal is to broaden the knowledge base by integrating insights from external databases across a wider range of information. Concurrently, various foundational models, such as Gemini, Claude, LLAMA, and others, will be evaluated to determine the best configurations.

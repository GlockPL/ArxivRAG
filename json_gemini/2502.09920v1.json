INTRODUCTION", "content": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to share a set of keys between two parties for information-theoretic unconditional security. The use of a low Earth orbit satellite-based network to distribute keys between parties has the potential to enable global security using QKD. Continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD), using Gaussian-modulated coherent states, involves encoding key information on the quadratures of an electric field, with the advantage of being operational with classical optical hardware and digital signal processing, when compared to discrete-variable QKD [1]. Both homodyne and heterodyne detectors can be used for coherent measurement of CV quantum signals (hereafter, referred to simply as \"signals\") [2].\nIn the context of free-space optical CV-QKD, transmitted local oscillators (TLOs) were traditionally considered for coherent measurement of the signals. Current state-of-the-art CV-QKD protocols, however, consider using a real local oscillator (RLO) created locally at the receiver, mitigating security loopholes associated with TLOs [3]. At the receiver, the RLO is manipulated so as to correct for the phase errors accumulated across the channel, such errors being measured from reference pulses that are polarization multiplexed with the signals. However, there remains a difference in the phase error measured using the reference pulses and the phase error"}, {"title": "II. SYSTEM MODEL", "content": "In our RLO-based CV-QKD protocol, Alice (subscript A) at the satellite encodes the reference pulses (subscript R) with quadrature values {XAR, PAR}, and signals (subscript S) with quadrature values {XAS, PAS }. The reference pulses and signals are then polarization multiplexed and transmitted across an atmospheric channel to Bob (subscript B) at the ground station. The encoded reference pulse information is shared with Bob beforehand, while the signal information is unknown to Bob and contains the secure key. At the receiver, Bob demultiplexes the reference pulses and signals, measuring their quadrature values {XBR, PBR } and {XB5, PBS }, respectively."}, {"title": "", "content": "The encoded quadratures are distorted by the channel, resulting in a reference pulse phase error $\\Delta \\Phi_R$, calculated as,\n$\\Delta \\Phi_R = tan^{-1} \\frac{P_{BR}}{X_{AR}X_{BR} + P_{AR}P_{BR}}$\nLikewise, the signal is also distorted by the channel and detector, accumulating a signal phase error $\\Delta \\phi_s$ (calculated using the same method as Eq. 1).\nIn our scheme, an RLO at the receiver is split into the RLO\u2081 and RLO2, where a heterodyne detector uses the RLO\u2081 to measure the reference pulse quadratures, such that $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ can be derived. Phase shifting the RLO2 by $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ for each pulse provides a first approximation of the true signal phase error $\\Delta \\phi_s$, $\\Delta \\Phi_R \\approx \\Delta \\phi_s$, increasing the coherence between the signal and RLO2. However, we assume that $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ measured by mixing the reference pulses and RLO\u2081 does not correspond exactly to $\\Delta \\phi_s$ measured by mixing the signals and RLO2, such that $\\Delta \\Phi_R \\neq \\Delta \\phi_s$ (shown experimentally in [5], [6]).\nEstimation of the true values of $\\Delta \\phi_s$ is, thus, an important aspect of RLO-based CV-QKD, where a perfect estimation of $\\Delta \\phi_s$, used to phase shift the RLO2, would result in ideal recovery of the encoded quadrature information, {XB5, PBS } ~ {XAS, PAs }. Estimation of $\\Delta \\phi_s$ is undertaken using a $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm. In practice, a $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm may be trained using known $\\Delta \\phi_s$ values; however, when being implemented for real-time CV-QKD, the $\\Delta \\phi_s$ is inherently unknown, thus only $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ can be used to output an estimate $\\Delta \\phi_s$ of $\\Delta \\phi_s$. Fig. 1 illustrates our RLO-based CV-QKD scheme, where $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ measurements are input into a NN-based $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm (described in Section III), which outputs an estimate $\\Delta \\phi_s$, used to phase shift the RLO2.\nPrevious works [4], [9]\u2013[11] have described the relationship between $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ and $\\Delta \\phi_s$ as being represented by a Gaussian function, which applies to every measurement of the reference pulses and signals. We term this the Gaussian phase noise, which is related to the reference pulse and signal measurements being shot-noise limited (representing the standard quantum limit), as well as experiencing different interactions with the atmospheric channel and receiver hardware.\nConsidering the Gaussian phase noise, simply taking the expectation of the previous N measurements of $\\Delta \\phi_r$ can result in a more precise estimate of the current $\\Delta \\phi_s$ value, which we define as the expectation estimator$\\langle \\Delta \\Phi_r \\rangle_N$. However, the relationship between $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ and $\\Delta \\phi_s$ is complex, involving many environmental and system-based factors. Therefore, a $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm should be able to adapt to any relationship between $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ and $\\Delta \\phi_s$, such that $\\Delta \\phi_s$ can be estimated using the information from the $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ measurements. Therefore, we propose a NN-based $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm capable of adapting to varying relationships between $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ and $\\Delta \\phi_s$, including for the Gaussian phase noise. Note that any change in channel conditions will result in initial poor $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation performance while the $\\Delta \\phi_s$ estimation algorithm adapts to the new conditions."}, {"title": "A.

The atmosphere is conceptually separated into layers (as described in [15]), where the width of each layer is varied as a function of altitude. The phase screens are placed at the center of each layer to simulate the distortion of the intensity and phase of the beam wavefront as if it had passed through an equivalent atmospheric volume.\nTo model turbulence, the refractive index structure parameter of turbulence $C_n^2$ is calculated as a function of altitude h in m, root mean square wind speed $U_{rms}$ in m/s, and ground-level $C_n^2$ in m-2/3, $C_n^2(0)$ as [15],\n$C_n^2(h) = (0.00594(\\frac{v_{rms}}{27})^2 (h \\times 10^{-5})^{10} exp(-h/1000) + 2.7 \\times 10^{-16} exp(-h/1500) + C_n^2(0) exp(-h/100))$\nwhere the root mean square wind speed is given by,\n$U_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{15 \\times 10^3} \\int_0^{20 \\times 10^3} v^2(h) dh}$\nwith v(h) representing altitude-dependent wind speed in m/s.

Case 1\nCase 1 focuses on the Gaussian phase noise (described in Section II-A), where the NN essentially learns to estimate $\\Delta \\phi_s$ by taking the mean of the previous N measurements of $\\Delta \\Phi_R$.

With the $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ measurements fixed at N = 20, there is a larger increase in estimation performance when hidden units are increased from $Z_{dim}$ = 4 to $z_{dim}$ = 32,\nas shown in Fig. 4 inset (a). On the contrary, when the $\\Delta \\Phi_R$\nmeasurements are fixed at N = 100, Model 14 ($Z_{dim}$ = 4) actually performs better than Model 15 ($Z_{dim}$ = 32). When the $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ measurements are varied from N = 20 to N = 100, it can be seen that the estimation performance initially increases with N, before reducing above N = 40. Thus, the NN is better able to learn the relationship between $\\Delta \\Phi_R$ and $\\Delta \\phi_s$ for lower N.

This paper introduces CyberSentinel, a unified, single-agent system for emergent threat detection, designed to identify and mitigate novel security risks in real time. CyberSentinel integrates: (1) Brute-force attack detection through SSH log analysis, (2) Phishing threat assessment using domain blacklists and heuristic URL scoring, and (3) Emergent threat detection via machine learning-based anomaly detection. By continuously adapting to evolving adversarial tactics, CyberSentinel strengthens proactive cybersecurity defense, addressing critical vulnerabilities in AI security.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Frontier AI systems introduce new security vulnerabilities, ranging from adversarial attacks on models [5,14] to emergent behaviors leading to unforeseen risks. These vulnerabilities often stem from the complex, high - dimensional nature of modern AI models, where small perturbations can be amplified into critical failures. Attackers exploit this complexity to craft adversarial inputs capable of bypassing conventional filters or inducing unintended model behaviors. Existing cybersecurity solutions are largely reactive, relying on signature based approaches or manual updates. As threat actors continuously evolve their tactics, purely reactive defenses struggle to keep pace, leaving systems exposed for extended periods.\nMoreover, recent advancements in large language models and generative AI create new opportunities for emergent threats, where malicious behavior arises not through explicit software vulnerabilities, but from subtle interactions between model parameters and cleverly crafted inputs. Examples include prompt injection attacks, which circumvent policy constraints by manipulating the AI's contextual reasoning and model drift exploitation, where an attacker"}, {"title": "Emergent Threat Detector (ETD): A Novel Contribution", "content": "A primary innovation within CyberSentinel is the Emergent Threat Detector (ETD), an adaptive, machine learning-based module for anomaly detection that identifies unconventional or evolving attacks in real time. While adversarial robustness and anomaly detection have been explored in past research [4, 14],\nour approach is distinguished by its seamless integration into a single - agent\nframework, where the ETD operates alongside brute - force and phishing mod-\nules under one orchestrator.\nArchitecture and Data Flow The ETD is built around a streaming data pipeline that ingests raw events such as authentication logs, system metrics and (optionally) GitHub repository activity. These data streams are normalized into a unified format (e.g., JSON), extracting key features like timestamps, IP addresses, event types and context - specific metadata. Standardizing data early\nallows the ETD to adapt to new sources or changing log formats with minimal\nreconfiguration."}, {"title": "Cybersecurity for AI Systems", "content": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cybersecurity has introduced both opportunities and vulnerabilities. Historically, security mechanisms have relied on rule - based models, where predefined patterns or signatures dictate whether an event is considered malicious. While effective against known threats, these approaches struggle to adapt to dynamic attack patterns, particularly in AI - driven systems that continuously evolve [17].\nTraditional cybersecurity models were designed to protect static infras-tructures, where network behavior followed predictable patterns. However, modern AI applications operate in complex, high - dimensional environments\nwhere adversarial behavior can emerge in unexpected ways. Attackers now exploit AI models themselves, manipulating machine learning algorithms\nthrough adversarial inputs, poisoning datasets, or leveraging model inversion techniques to extract sensitive information [16]. These evolving attack vectors\nhighlight the urgent need for adaptive security architectures that can re-spond to threats in real time.\nExisting AI security research primarily focuses on adversarial robustness, designing models that resist perturbations, or explainability, ensuring AI de-cisions remain interpretable [9,14]. However, there is a growing recognition that cybersecurity frameworks must incorporate self - learning and autonomous\ndefense mechanisms that can detect and mitigate novel threats as they arise."}, {"title": "Emergent Threats in AI Systems", "content": "Emergent threats refer to security vulnerabilities or attack patterns that arise unpredictably within AI - driven systems. Unlike traditional cyber threats,\nwhich often follow known exploit chains or malware signatures, emergent threats result from the complex interactions of AI models with their environment, data sources, or adversarial inputs. These threats often evade conventional detection mechanisms because they do not exhibit predefined attack signatures [2].\nOne example of an emergent threat is model drift exploitation, where attackers manipulate AI training data over time, gradually shifting the model's behavior until it becomes vulnerable to specific inputs. Another case involves\nprompt injection attacks against large language models, where carefully\ncrafted inputs bypass intended constraints to elicit unauthorized or harmful responses. These attack techniques are particularly challenging to detect be-cause they do not originate from explicit vulnerabilities in the software stack\nbut instead exploit the inherent statistical nature of AI decision - making.\nRecent high - profile AI security breaches illustrate the risks associated with\nemergent threats. For example, deepfake phishing attacks have leveraged\ngenerative AI to impersonate executives and bypass traditional authentication methods, leading to financial fraud. Similarly, AI powered misinforma-tion campaigns have demonstrated how adversaries can manipulate public"}, {"title": "Agent - Based Cybersecurity", "content": "Cybersecurity defense strategies can broadly be categorized into multi - agent\nand single - agent frameworks. Multi- agent approaches distribute security\nresponsibilities across multiple autonomous entities, each specializing in differ-ent aspects of threat detection and mitigation. This architecture is well - suited\nfor large scale enterprise environments, where multiple layers of defense col-laborate to provide comprehensive coverage. However, multi agent systems introduce complexity in coordination, communication overhead and potential\nfailure points when trust assumptions between agents break down.\nIn contrast, single - agent cybersecurity frameworks focus on autonomous,\nself - contained security agents capable of executing multiple defensive func-tions within a unified model. A single agent approach simplifies deployment,\nreduces inter - agent dependency risks and ensures a coherent decision - mak-ing process. CyberSentinel follows this paradigm, implementing an adaptive single - agent security model that integrates anomaly detection, brute\nforce monitoring, phishing protection and emergent threat detection\nwithin a single cohesive system.\nA key advantage of the single - agent model is its ability to dynamically\nadjust its detection strategies based on observed behavior. Rather than relying\non static rule sets, CyberSentinel continuously learns from past security\nevents, refining its internal models to improve accuracy over time. Additionally,\nthe single agent framework is more amenable to edge deployment, enabling\nreal - time monitoring without reliance on centralized infrastructure.\nAgent - based cybersecurity aligns closely with advancements in autonomous AI systems, where decision - making must occur at the edge, in real - time\nand without human intervention. As cyber threats become more auto-mated, adaptive and stealthy, the need for intelligent security agents that\ncan evolve alongside adversarial tactics becomes increasingly apparent."}, {"title": "CyberSentinel: A Single - Agent Emergent Threat Detector", "content": "CyberSentinel is a modular, real - time threat detection framework designed to monitor, identify and adapt to both known and emerging cybersecurity risks.

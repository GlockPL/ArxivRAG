The semiconductor process comprises three main stages: (a) design and development, during which fabless firms create chip blueprints, specifying the architecture, functions, and specifications of the miniaturized chips; (b) fabrication, where specialized foundries manufacture chips by etching integrated circuits onto silicon wafers using intricate technologies; and (c) testing and assembly, during which chips undergo rigorous testing and are subsequently assembled into protective packages for integration into electronic devices. This collective effort results in the production of high-quality semiconductor components suitable for a wide range of applications. The state-of-the-art imaging and analysis methods are indispensable in semiconductor manufacturing for the development of next-generation miniaturized chips, especially those sized at 7 nm or smaller. The pursuit of miniaturized chips below 7 nm technologies introduces a level of complexity and precision that significantly increases the risk of errors in the manufacturing process. These errors can compromise the consistency of high-quality chips and amplify the variability in chip performance, posing a substantial challenge for manufacturers aiming to produce reliable and advanced chips at this scale. The semiconductor industry utilizes various advanced electron beam tools, including scanning and transmission electron microscopy, to create images or micrographs of semiconductor materials, structures, and devices at the micro and nanoscale with high resolution and detail. These tools contribute to quality control, process monitoring, failure analysis, and materials characterization in the semiconductor industry. Automated labeling of electron micrographs, though advantageous, poses a considerable challenge due to the level of detail, complexity of patterns, and information density involved. These challenges arise primarily from the high inter-category similarity (similar-looking or indistinguishable) between different nanomaterials, high intra-category dissimilarity within nanomaterials (distinct or differing appearances), and the presence of intricate visual patterns in nanomaterials across various scales (spatial heterogeneity)."}, {"title": "", "content": "Recently, unimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 (language-only) which are pretrained autoregressive large-scale models on extensive, diverse text corpora in unsupervised learning settings following a fundamental paradigm \u201cprompt and predict\" approach, have significantly transformed natural language processing(NLP), achieving improved performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, demonstrating better logical reasoning abilities, and generating human-like text. Zero-shot Chain of Thought(Zero-Shot CoT) and Few-Shot (In-Context) learning(Few-Shot ICL) are prompt engineering strategies for designing and crafting tailored prompts for utilizing general-purpose LLMs in specialized language-based tasks or associated new, unseen problem-solving scenarios, thereby eliminating the need for traditional task-specific fine-tuning. Zero-Shot CoT relies on customized instructions without requiring explicit task-specific demonstrations(input-output pairs), requiring the language model to generalize from the implicit knowledge acquired during training to generate the output for the downstream task. Conversely, Few-shot ICL incorporates a few guiding demonstrations to learn from analogy along with the task-centric instructions to guide LLMs to generate the output simply by conditioning on the prompts. In recent times, OpenAI's GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V), which possesses the ability to process and understand images, represents a significant advancement in the domain of large multimodal models (LMMs). It is more versatile than GPT-4, as it has broken the text-only barrier of previous language models, introducing visual understanding and analysis as a new dimension. GPT-4V is designed to accept multiple modalities, including both images and text as input, and generate text outputs. GPT-4V incorporates visual processing capabilities, enabling it to analyze image inputs provided by the user in conjunction with text, thereby facilitating visual question answering. Despite its advanced capabilities, when tested on SEM images for nanomaterial categorization, GPT-4V incorrectly classified them, highlighting the limitations of LMMs."}, {"title": "", "content": "Despite advances in the use of language-only LLMs such as GPT-4, LMMs like GPT-4V and other behemoths across various scientific disciplines, the synergistic integration of foundational LLMs and LMMs with computer vision algorithms in semiconductor research, particularly for the automated electron micrograph identification task, remains an underexplored approach in the evolution of intelligent semiconductor manufacturing processes. In this study, we introduce an automated nanomaterial identification framework, which is built upon cross-modal electron micrograph representation learning, referred to as CM-EMRL for brevity. The objective is to utilize the complementary strengths of LMMs, LLMs, and small-scale language models(LMs) to establish a more robust and accurate predictive framework. Closed-source LLMs like GPT-4, while proficient in language understanding, have a black-box nature, and lack interpretability for downstream applications since they typically do not provide direct access to logits or token embeddings. In addition, their jack-of-all-trades approach makes them incredibly resource-intensive for repurposing and often poorly aligned with specialized tasks. On the other hand, open-source smaller LMs like BERT following \u201cpretraining and fine-tuning\" approach, while cost-effective for repurposing through fine-tuning to align with specialized tasks and be interpretable, may fall short in terms of reasoning and generalization, often yielding less coherent and contextually relevant responses compared to LLMs. LMMs such as GPT-4V are more potent and versatile than language-only LLMs, as they incorporate multi-sensory capabilities that combine visual and language understanding. This enables users to instruct the multimodal model to analyze image inputs alongside textual information. Consequently, it offers the ability to perform complex tasks that require an understanding of both text and visual inputs, producing output that is contextually relevant to the combined data. LMMs excel in multimodal processing, with their remarkable capabilities to analyze images, identify objects, transcribe text, and decipher data, but they grapple with challenges related to interpretability, bias, unpredictability, and resource consumption. Navigating these challenges among LLMs, LMMs, and small-scale LMs demands a fine balance between performance, efficiency, and interpretability. Our study introduces a novel approach to the automatic nanomaterial identification task, combining the strengths of LMMs, LLMs, and small-scale LMs. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) for Holistic Image Representation: An input image is divided into patches treated as tokens, converted into 1D vectors, and enhanced with positional embeddings for location context. A classification token is added to achieve a global image representation.

It optimizes tasks without backpropagation, ensuring low costs irrespective of the model size. The open-ended natural language CoT prompts guide LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions of nanomaterials, covering their structure, synthesis methods, properties, and applications. After obtaining these technical descriptions, a smaller pretrained language model (LM) is used to summarize the LLM-generated content and compute high-level text embeddings by aligning them through supervised fine-tuning for the downstream nanomaterial identification task. Furthermore, in a cross-modal alignment scenario, a scaled dot-product attention mechanism matches image embeddings with their corresponding text-level embeddings. This mechanism calculates similarity scores to determine the best text match for a given image, ensuring robust alignment between different modalities. In brief, we utilize CoT LLM prompting to extract domain-specific knowledge and obtain image-aligned (nanomaterial-specific) text-level embeddings.\n\u2022 In-Context Learning in LMMs via Few-Shot Prompting for Nanomaterial Identification: Utilizing few-shot prompting can quickly adapt LMMs to perform new tasks, like nanomaterial identification, without extensive fine-tuning. By providing LMMs with a limited set of image-label pairs, these models can predict the category of unfamiliar or unseen nanomaterial images. Two strategies, random and similarity-driven sampling, influence the selection of these pairs. Instead of updating model parameters through supervised learning, this approach leverages the multimodal model's inherent knowledge, generating prediction embeddings by solely conditioned on the prompt.\n\u2022 Unified Attention Layer: We utilize a hierarchical multi-head attention mechanism to compute a cross-modal embedding from image-level, text-level, and prediction embeddings.

We divide the image into smaller, non-overlapping regions or patches to obtain a sequence of tokens. Each patch is treated as a token and has a fixed size with spatial dimensions of P \u00d7 P \u00d7 C, where P denotes the patch size. The total number of patches is given by n = (HW). We then linearly encode each patch, each of which has an overall size of P2C, to flatten it into a 1D vector represented as I' \u2208 Rn\u00d7d, where d is the patch embedding dimension. To provide the model with spatial information, we add positional embeddings to each patch. These positional embeddings are learnable vectors representing the position of each patch within the image grid. They help us understand the relative positions of different patches, and we add the position embeddings element-wise to the patch embeddings. In addition, we append a classification token <cls> to the patch sequence. This token aggregates information from all patches and provides an embedding of the entire patch sequence, creating a global representation of the entire input image. We input this augmented token sequence into ViT, which consists of multiple stacked transformer encoder layers. Each encoder layer processes the patch embeddings hierarchically, refining representations at different abstraction levels. After passing through the transformer layers, we consider only the output embedding hels corresponding to the <cls> token as the representation of the entire image. This embedding aggregates information from all the patches and summarizes it.

We utilize open-ended natural language prompts, designed to be flexible and non-restrictive, to instruct LLMs to generate the detailed technical descriptions related to various aspects of nanomaterials, including their structure, properties, and applications. We query LMMs to generate detailed descriptions of nanomaterials by employing a customized prompt template for zero-shot generation tasks, steering them through CoT prompts in a zero-shot context. This process involves extracting pre-existing domain-specific knowledge embedded within the language model parameters acquired during training to generate in-depth, technical descriptions of nanomaterials that are both detailed and comprehensive. The customized CoT prompt format is as follows:\nPrompt 1: Introduction: Provide an overview of the nanomaterial category and its significance across various fields.

In our study, we utilize a pre-trained small-scale LM, DeBERTa, an improved version of the BERT architecture. We fine-tune this small-scale LM on the generated technical descriptions for domain-specific customization on the downstream task. This helps the language model learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases in the large corpus of LLM textual outputs, thereby facilitating the generation of context-aware token embeddings. We input the text sequences generated by LLMs (denoted as Sexpl) into the LMexpl model, which then generates expressive token embeddings as follows:\nhexpl = LMexpl(Sexpl)\nwhere the deep contextualized embeddings are denoted as hexpl \u2208 R m\u00d7d, where m represents the number of tokens in Sexpl and d is token embedding dimension. We perform weighted average of all token embeddings for a comprehensive representation of the entire text. We use a softmax attention mechanism to compute interpretable attention weights, denoted as a, and subsequently use these weights to sum-pool the token embeddings, encoding the textual descriptions into a fixed-size, high-level text representation as follows:\na = softmax(q); q = uThexpl\nntext = \u03a3ajhexpl\nwhere u is a learnable vector and the subscript j refers to token. The text-level embedding htext \u2208 R(d) encapsulates the relevant and concise information at the core of the domain knowledge in technical descriptions, which is extracted from the general-purpose LLMs for each nanomaterial.\nCross-Modal Alignment Using Multi-Head Self-Attention: We employ the multi-head self-attention mechanism to align image embeddings with their corresponding text embeddings for image-text matching purposes. This approach emphasizes specific aspects or features of the image that is semantically relevant to the textual descriptions, taking into consideration the different facets of the relationship of the cross-domain modalities (both text-level and image embeddings). The mechanism calculates similarity scores between the provided image embedding and all text embeddings. The text embedding with the highest similarity score is considered the best match for the given image embedding. We initially concatenate the text-level embeddings for the different nanomaterial categories to obtain a unified text-level embedding htext = [hext..., h], where c refers to the total number of nanomaterials. We compute the value and key projections for the unified text-level embedding, which represents the combined semantic information of all nanomaterials, for each head h as follows:\nKext = htext W; Vext = htext Wh\nSimilarly, the query projection for image embedding hels for each head h is as follows:\nQas = hels Wh\ncls"}, {"title": "", "content": "where Wh\nh\nh\nKtext, West, and We are trainable weight matrices. We now utilize the scaled-dot product attention mechanism to compute the normalized attention score, which measures the semantic similarity between the image embedding and each text embedding for a specific attention head h as follows:\nAh = softmax(Qhis (Kext))\nwhere dk denotes the dimensionality of the keys. The attention weights align complementary information from the cross-domain embeddings, focusing on relevant information for cross-modal alignment and capturing richer semantics by allowing the framework to dynamically weigh different parts of the input based on their relevance to the context. We then compute the weighted sum of the value projection as follows:\nOext = A Vext\nWe concatenate the outputs across different heads because it encapsulates perspectives from multiple heads which focus on different aspects or features, thus producing a more comprehensive and robust alignment between the two modalities. We project the outputs to obtain the final representation as follows:\nH Otext = [text..., Oxt] Wo\nwhere H represents the total number of heads and Wo deontes the trainable weight matrix. We now compute the cosine similarity between the two cross-domain embeddings as follows:\nSim =\nOtext hels\n||Otext||2\u00d7 ||hcls ||2\nwhere sim \u2208 R, and we select the best match based on the highest similarity value. The index is determined for the text-level embedding with the highest similarity score as follows:\ni* = argmax; (Sim)\nHere, i* is the index of the best-matching text-level embedding. So, the best-matching text-level embedding would be:\nhext = hext\nThis is essentially a matching mechanism that seeks to find the best pairwise alignment among the various text-level embeddings and the image embedding. We utilize backpropagation error in the downstream supervised multi-classification task to fine-tune the ViT and smaller LMs to maximize the pairwise alignment between the complementary image embedding (hcls) and its corresponding text-level embedding (htext). To summarize, hrtext incorporates the prior knowledge obtained from LLMs for the appropriate nanomaterial underlying the elecron micrographs as auxiliary information to support multi-modal learning.\nFew-Shot LMM Prompting: Few-shot prompting enables LMMs such as GPT-4V to adapt to new tasks without the need for explicit, gradient-based fine-tuning using the labeled data. This approach allows LMMs to learn by analogy, utilizing only a few input-output pairs specific to the downstream task. Few-shot prompting leverages the implicit knowledge embedded in pretrained LMM parameters to adapt to new tasks through task-specific demonstrations, thereby avoiding the need to repurpose LMMs with parameter updates. The context-augmented prompt provides task-specific instructions and demonstrations(input-"}, {"title": "", "content": "output pairs), enabling LMMs to generate outputs conditioned on the prompt for improved generalization performance on the new, unfamiliar tasks. In the case of nanomaterial identification tasks, few-shot prompting involves creating a context-augmented prompt using a few input-output mappings (Zi, Vi), which are a small number of image-label pairs as demonstrations sampled from the training data relevant to the query(new/unseen) image. These mappings provide relevant context to aid in understanding and classifying unseen images. The task-specific instruction is related to the query image, instructing the multimodal model to predict its associated label. At inference time, given test images Itest, few-shot prompting predicts an output label based on the conditional probability distribution, P(test | ((Itrain, Ytrain), Ztest)). To explore how the quality and quantity of few-shot demonstrations affect the performance in nanomaterial identification tasks, we consider two distinct sampling strategies: \"Random\" and \"Similarity-driven Sampling\". The random approach involves selecting demonstrations (image-label pairs) arbitrarily from the training data without any specific criteria, serving as a baseline for evaluation. In contrast, the similarity-driven sampling strategy employs cosine similarity to identify the top-K images that most closely resemble a given query image within the training data. This strategy operates under the hypothesis that demonstrations which are more representative of the query image's data distribution can potentially enhance model adaptability and accuracy. By utilizing both the diverse strategies to construct augmented prompts, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of how different demonstration sampling methods impact the effectiveness of few-shot learning in nanomaterial identification tasks. Furthermore, the efficacy of the demonstrations is inherently related to the sampling methods used to retrieve the top-K images that align most closely with the query image. To further explore the impact of the volume of demonstrations on performance, we adjust the number of demonstrations K for each query image. In summary, our objective is to provide LMMs with a context-augmented prompt, comprising image-label pairs selected from the training data, along with task-specific instructions that guide the LMMs in predicting the nanomaterial category of the query image. This task evaluates the LMMs' ability to predict nanomaterial categories based on the prompt without any parameter updates, distinguishing it from traditional supervised learning, where models are fine-tuned on labeled data. For each query image, the LMMs generate a c-dimensional one-hot vector hpred \u2208 R, where e denotes the predefined number of nanomaterial categories. This vector is linearly encoded into a high-dimensional space to produce a prediction embedding hICL \u2208 Rd, which encapsulates the LMMs predictions. Here, d represents the embedding dimension and c\u226a d. An example of an ICL prompt is as follows, Below are the input-output pairs (image-label pairs) for the nanomaterial identification task.

A general purpose GPT-4V is accessible to ChatGPT Plus subscribers with a usage cap at chat.openai.com. However, it's not currently available for public use through Multimodal Modeling as a Service (MMaaS) - a cloud-based service that accepts both image and textual inputs as prompts. By utilizing black-box GPT-4V through MMaaS as an on-demand service, typically hosted on cloud servers and accessed via an API, users can design task-specific prompts to query pre-trained LMMs for solving multimodal tasks of interest. This is analogous to how users might access LLMs via Language Modeling as a Service (LMaaS) to tackle language-specific tasks. GPT-4V is anticipated to become publicly accessible by mid-November 2023. APIs are designed for large-scale and concurrent requests and are ideal for integration into automated systems. Conversely, websites might not efficiently handle numerous interactions in rapid succession, and automating tasks on them could be prohibited. Manually sending inputs for GPT-4V for the entire training dataset would be a daunting and tedious task. Instead, we select a subset of images from the whole training dataset, termed 'Confounding or Ambiguous Micrographs', for few-shot prompting of GPT-4V. The selection process for these images is as follows: The SEM electron micrographs, initially sized at 1024 \u00d7 768 \u00d7 3 pixels, were downscaled to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3 pixels. They were then normalized using z-score normalization and flattened into one-dimensional vectors. Their dimensionality was further reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before employing the K-Means clustering algorithm. We chose K = 10 clusters based on a predefined number of nanomaterial categories based on benchmark dataset. This method identifies images that are challenging to classify by measuring distances from centroids, assessing cluster variance, and calculating the Silhouette Score. Ground truth labels aid in the evaluation of the clustering's effectiveness. We sampled a fixed 10% of the ambiguous images from the entire dataset. For these images, we apply few-shot prompting of GPT-4V to predict labels. The goal is to learn the optimal projection layer weight matrices, which transform the GPT-4V predictions (one-hot vectors) into a high-dimensional space, producing a prediction embedding h\u2081cL \u2208 Rd that encapsulates the GPT-4V predictions. The projection layer is subsequently trained through the supervised learning task. This training aims to minimize the cross-entropy loss and obtain optimal weights.\nUnified Attention Layer: We compute the cross-modal embedding, denoted as hcross, using a hierarchical multi-head attention mechanism that integrates the original image embedding hels, the text-level embedding hext, and the prediction embedding HICL. This mechanism offers a robust framework for integrating diverse information from different modalities. As a result, it can produce a more holistic representation that encompasses a wide range of information, potentially improving the performance of nanomaterial identification tasks. In general, the multi-head attention mechanism uses multiple heads to capture different attention patterns, allowing the"}, {"title": "", "content": "model to recognize a variety of relationships in the data from multiple subspace representations. Given queries Q, keys K, and values V, the scaled dot-product attention is defined as follows:\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax V\nwhere dk is the dimensionality of the keys. The multi-head attention mechanism employs multiple heads to integrate various attention patterns into a unified representation. Each of these heads utilizes the scaled dot-product attention on distinct linear transformations of the input queries, keys, and values. These transformations are parameterized by matrices WQ, WK\u2081, and Wv. The final output is derived by concatenating the results from these heads and subjecting it to a subsequent matrix transformation Wo.\nMultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh) Wo\nwhere head = Attention(QWQ, KWK\u2081, VWv;)\nGiven the context described earlier, the unified attention layer employs the multi-head attention mechanism in a hierarchical fashion to derive the cross-modal embedding. The procedure consists of two main stages: (1) Image-Text Attention: Here, the unified attention layer focuses on the image embedding hels in relation to the text-level embedding htext. The result is an intermediate embedding, himg-text, which amalgamates details from both image and text modalities through the multi-head attention mechanism. The primary intent of this step is to incorporate relevant textual information guided by the image's context. This can be mathematically described as follows:\nhimg-text = MultiHead (hcls, text, text)\n(2) Image-Text-Prediction Attention: During this stage, the previously derived intermediate embedding himg-text undergoes further refinement. The unified attention layer aligns this embedding with the prediction embedding hICL, computing the final cross-modal representation hcross. This stage aims to combine insights from the intermediate representation with the prediction embedding, creating a comprehensive representation that seamlessly integrates various modalities. This can be represented mathematically as:\nhcross = MultiHead(himg-text, HICL, HICL)\nIn summary, the unified attention layer uses multi-head attention mechanisms to capture and integrate information from multiple different modalities (image, text, prediction) in a hierarchical manner, resulting in the comprehensive cross-modal embedding that can be used for nanomaterial identification tasks. This mechanism employs multiple sets of learned weight matrices to emphasize various aspects or relationships within the data. Consequently, this approach has the potential to foster robust and enriched embeddings capable of capturing complex patterns. Additionally, it aids in focusing on contextually relevant information and in achieving semantic alignment across different embeddings, thereby enhancing the capacity to identify and utilize important features in the input data. Finally, we linearly transform the final unified cross-modal embedding to obtain a probability distribution p\u2081 over the possible outcomes, as follows:\np\u2081 = softmax (Whcross)\np\u2081 represents the probability distribution across nanomaterial categories. We apply the argmax operation to p\u2081 to"}, {"title": "Experiments And Results", "content": "Datasets: Our study utilized the SEM dataset to automate nanomaterial identification.

The proposed framework involves four components: (a) The first component, the electron micrograph encoder, takes an input image and divides it into smaller patches. These patches are transformed into tokens, enriched with positional embeddings for spatial information, and a classification token is added as a separate token to represent the overall image content. The resulting augmented token sequence is fed into a ViT model to generate an embedding that represents the entire image. (b) Next, the zero-shot CoT LLMs prompting technique uses cloud services to access LLMs for generating detailed descriptions about various aspects of nanomaterials. Structured prompts guide the LLMs in generating in-depth descriptions on topics ranging from the fundamental properties of nanomaterials to their practical applications.

We then perform sum-pooling attention mechanism to obtain contextualized text-level embeddings, which capture the core knowledge in the generated texts. (c) Finally, the cross-modal alignment employs the scaled dot-product attention mechanism to match the image embeddings with the corresponding nanomaterial-specific text-level embeddings. This process highlights image features relevant to the textual descriptions, aiding in the identification of text-level embeddings that correspond to the image. (c) Few-shot prompting enables LMMs to quickly adapt to new tasks without traditional fine-tuning on labeled data. Using a small set of input-output pairs, these models learn tasks by drawing from their vast pre-existing knowledge acquired during training on vast, diverse text corpora. In the context of nanomaterial identification, LMMs utilize a handful of image-label pairs from the training data to classify new, unseen images and obtain prediction embeddings. Demonstrations can be selected either randomly or based on their similarity to the (c) Few-shot prompting enables LMMs to quickly adapt to new tasks without traditional"}, {}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The expansion of global e-commerce has exponentially increased the complexity and volume of warehouse operations, necessitating more advanced automation technologies. Traditional automated picking systems often struggle with inefficiencies and inaccuracies, particularly during peak operational demands. Current systems, while partially automated, fail to adapt dynamically to the varied and unpredictable nature of warehouse environments, leading to increased error rates and operational costs.\nThis study addresses these shortcomings by integrating cutting-edge machine learning technologies, specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning, with automated picking systems in warehouses. Unlike conventional methods, which rely heavily on static algorithms and manual oversight, our approach leverages a sophisticated ensemble of machine learning models to enhance decision-making processes. This integration not only improves accuracy and efficiency in picking operations but also ensures robust adaptability under fluctuating operational conditions.\nPioneering work by industry leaders such as Amazon has shown the potential of such technologies, yet there remains a significant gap in their application across diverse warehouse settings. Our research fills this gap by tailoring machine learning solutions to various operational scales and environmental complexities, thus boosting logistics performance and enhancing corporate competitiveness."}, {"title": "II.

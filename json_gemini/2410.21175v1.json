This study is conducted to propose a framework of automatic crack segmentation from high-resolution images containing crack information about steel box girders of bridges. Considering the multi-scale feature of cracks, convolutional neural network architecture of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) for crack detection is proposed. As for input, 120 raw images are processed via two approaches (shrinking the size of images and splitting images into sub-images). Then, models with the proposed structure of FPN for crack detection are developed. The result shows all developed models can automatically detect the cracks at the raw images. By shrinking the images, the computation efficiency is improved without decreasing accuracy. Because of the separable characteristic of crack, models using the splitting method provide more accurate crack segmentations than models using the resizing method. Therefore, for high-resolution images, the FPN structure coupled with the splitting method is an promising solution for the crack segmentation and detection.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Numerous civil infrastructures such as aged buildings and bridges have gradually approached their design life expectancy, which could cause harmful effects on the safety of people [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively check and evaluate the integrity of the civil structure.

There are also problems with unreliable inspection results as well as the time it takes.\nAs computer vision has made remarkable achievements in various fields, such as object recognition, image segmentation and image classification, more and more researchers start to"}, {"title": "DATASET", "content": "There are a total of 200 raw images provided by the International Project Competition organizer.

Thus, another method is proposed to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy is splitting images of the basic training set into sub-images. The sub-images are 480 \u00d7 640 pixels. Before splitting the images, images of 3264 \u00d7 4928/3864 \u00d7 5152 pixels are first padding into 3360 \u00d7 5120/4320 \u00d7 5760 with zeros which can contribute to collecting the edge information of one image. After padding, a stride of 320/320 pixels in rows/columns is applied to the images in the basic training set, getting all 15861 sub-images and 15861 correspond sub-labels.

The encoder is the feedforward process of the convolutional network, which extracts feature vectors at different stages, and the feature resolution is continuously reduced.

The above two feature vectors are added to form $P4 = (N, 256, 30, 40)$. These operations are called skip connection, as shown in Fig. 5(b), which are continued using to get P4, P3 and P2.\nThe cleverness of skip connection is that it can make use of both the high-level semantic features of the top layer (helpful for crack feature classification) and the high-resolution information of the bottom layer (helpful for crack feature location)."}, {"title": "Assembling", "content": "For the following assembly assembling operation, the output feature vector of each level of the pyramid should be the same resolution.

The performance and accuracy of the proposed framework were validated. Conclusions from the study are summarized as follows:\n1) The proposed framework for crack segmentation using FPN coupled with image resizing/splitting method illustrates powerful capability in crack detection based on high- resolution images. The mean IoU reaches 0.78 in maximum. The proposed framework demonstrates a strong sense of semantic information and the ability to detect target cracks of different sizes.\n2) For the proposed framework, resizing high-resolution images with a bilinear interpolation algorithm and splitting high-resolution images into sub-images can achieve a balance between computation efficiency and accuracy. When resizing high-resolution images, images can shrink smaller without decreasing segmentation accuracy.\n3) Parts of crack can provide enough information for identification. In the segmentation task of crack, splitting images into sub-images is proved as an excellent solution for high- resolution images. By splitting images, every pixel in the images is predicted and pixels belonging to crack damage are precisely annotated. A high degree of accuracy means this method provides a promising solution for the crack detection tasks in the future."}]}

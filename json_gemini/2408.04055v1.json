Kalinin"], "abstract": "Since the dawn of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), tapping or intermittent contact mode has been one of the most widely used imaging modes. Manual optimization of tapping mode not only takes a lot of instrument and operator time, but also often leads to frequent probe and sample damage, poor image quality and reproducibility issues for new types of samples or inexperienced users. Despite wide use, optimization of tapping mode imaging is an extremely hard problem, ill-suited to either classical control methods or machine learning. Here we introduce a reward-driven workflow to automate the optimization of SPM in the tapping mode. The reward function is defined based on multiple channels with physical and empirical knowledge of good scans encoded, representing a sample-agnostic measure of image quality and imitating the decision-making logic employed by human operators. This automated workflow gives optimal scanning parameters for different probes and samples and gives high-quality SPM images consistently in the attractive mode. This study broadens the application and accessibility of SPM and opens the door for fully automated SPM.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has revolutionized our understanding of the nanoworld, providing unprecedented insights into the structure and properties of materials at the nanoscale. This powerful technique allows for structural imaging in diverse environments, including ambient conditions, liquids, and vacuum, making it versatile for various applications [1-3]. Over the years, SPM has evolved significantly, building upon the initial contact and non-contact modes [4, 5] to yield a broad array of advanced imaging modes. These advancements have been driven by continuous improvements in hardware and electronics, culminating in the ability to achieve atomic resolution imaging even in ambient conditions [6].\nTopographic imaging in SPM not only reveals the surface morphology but also provides additional information through various signal channels. For instance, in the basic tapping mode with periodic drive, phase signals can be obtained and offer insights into material properties and interactions [7, 8]. Moreover, SPM's versatility is further enhanced by the introduction of multi-frequency modes, as demonstrated in [9, 10]. These modes enable the simultaneous acquisition of multiple data channels, enriching our understanding of the sample's properties.\nThe range of functional imaging modes available in SPM is broad and encompasses various physical properties, such as magnetic [5, 11, 12], mechanical [4, 5], biological [3, 13-15], ferroelectric [16], and electrical characteristics [5, 17]. Each of these modes allows researchers to probe different aspects of the sample, providing a comprehensive view of its functional behavior. However, the effectiveness and reliability of these functional imaging modes are critically dependent on the quality of topographic imaging. Operators must simultaneously achieve multiple objectives, including optimizing image stability, enhancing resolution, and minimizing both reversible and irreversible changes in the probe and sample states. Achieving these goals is a complex and time-consuming process that requires significant expertise. The success of SPM imaging heavily depends on the operator's skill and experience, often leading to irreproducible results when different operators or probes are involved. For example, when imaging hard samples like crystals and ceramics [3, 18-20], a set of inappropriate scanning parameters can lead to fast probe degradation and poor image quality. On soft samples such as soft matters and liquid samples [2, 14, 15, 21-23], non-optimal scanning parameters lead to irreversible sample damage and poor image quality. This challenge is particularly pronounced when dealing with soft systems, nanoparticles, molecules, high-resolution imaging, and imaging in liquids. Transitioning from robust calibration on hard samples to these more delicate and complex systems requires meticulous optimization.\nOne of the most widely used SPM imaging modes is tapping mode [24, 25], also known as intermittent contact (AC) or amplitude-modulated (AM) mode. In tapping mode, the cantilever is driven at or near its lowest resonance frequency. The amplitude and phase of its oscillations are detected using a lock-in amplifier. As the tip approaches the surface, the tip-surface interactions dampen the cantilever's amplitude, which can then be used as a feedback signal for topographic imaging. A key advantage of tapping mode is its ability to significantly"}, {"title": "reduce tip and surface damage, making it suitable for imaging much softer samples compared to contact mode.", "content": "Optimizing the scanning parameters in tapping mode is a very difficult task. This is ill-suited to machine learning methods, as all surfaces are different and hence the classical supervised ML paradigm is poorly applicable [26]. This problem is equally complex for classical control methods, as it is not clear how the cantilever dynamics translate into image quality. Each sample's unique topography, mechanical properties, and environmental interactions contribute to a complex, high-dimensional parameter space that defies straightforward modeling or control. Traditional approaches struggle with this variability, often resulting in suboptimal imaging conditions that can lead to poor resolution, increased noise, or even damage to the sample and the probe [27, 28]. At the same time, we note that human operators learn to optimize the scanning conditions, and this knowledge is transferable between different materials and instruments. Skilled operators can intuitively adjust parameters based on their knowledge and experience, achieving high-quality imaging through iterative experimentation and fine-tuning. Hence, we seek to develop an approach that allows transferring the human operator decision-making principles to machine learning workflows. By incorporating human expertise into a reward-driven machine learning framework, we aim to automate the optimization process, ensuring consistent, high-quality imaging across diverse samples and conditions, while reducing the dependency on operator expertise and minimizing the risk of errors.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that reward-driven, rather than data-driven, machine learning methods can effectively automate the optimization of SPM imaging for various samples, probes, and microscopes in a traceable manner with minimal requirement of computation power that can be fulfilled on a local computer without use of graphic processing unit (GPU), which makes it widely accessible. The key innovation in our approach is the introduction of a reward function that transforms the tuning problem into a classical optimization task. This reward function is based on the trace and retrace scan lines of height and phase channels, incorporating both physical and empirical knowledge of high-quality scans. Essentially, the reward function emulates human expertise, guiding the machine learning algorithm to optimize imaging parameters and consistently achieve the best possible image quality. Despite its apparent simplicity, this solution has eluded the microscopy community for four decades. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to standardize and streamline the optimization process, reducing dependency on operator expertise and improving the reproducibility of SPM imaging."}, {"title": "Reward function-based optimization", "content": "The key aspect of any microscopy experiment is the optimization of image conditions, which typically represents a considerable fraction of the instrument time and effort of the human operator. During this process, the operator tunes the parameters while simultaneously assessing the quality of the data streaming from the instrument. This tuning of imaging conditions in any microscopy mode can be generally represented as an optimization problem within the parameter"}, {"title": "space of the instrument controls, which are typically well known and provided by the manufacturer. However, defining image quality presents a very complex problem. For atomically resolved imaging in electron microscopy [29] or scanning tunneling microscopy [30], the shape of atomic columns or the presence and intensity of lattice peaks in Fourier transforms offer natural optimization targets [31]. With the optimization target and parameter space defined, this becomes a classical optimization problem.", "content": "In non-atomically resolved imaging, unambiguous measures of image resolution or quality are absent. Furthermore, these cannot be defined using classical machine learning approaches since each topographic image is different and hence unique with respect to previous examples. While supervised ML workflows can be built for mature fields such as semiconductor imaging, this paradigm is limited for open-ended research problems. Additionally, descriptive statistics-based measures tend not to be robust with respect to noise and scan instabilities. Previous attempts at automatically tuning SPM have focused on adjusting the PI (proportional-integral) feedback parameters by defining reward functions based on the alignment of the trace and retrace of the height channel. However, these approaches usually result in scanning parameters that lead to rapid probe and sample degradation.\nDespite these challenges, human operators learn to optimize scanning conditions through experience acquired on different samples. They intuitively adjust parameters based on real-time feedback from the instrument and their accumulated knowledge of how different settings affect image quality. This ability to adapt and fine-tune parameters through iterative experimentation enables skilled operators to achieve high-quality imaging even under varying and challenging conditions.\nTherefore, the key challenge in automating the optimization of the tapping mode (TM) is to find a reward function that works universally across different probes, materials, topologies, and operational environments. Here we design such a reward function based on trace and retrace scan lines that incorporates both physics-based knowledge and empirical insights. Compared to reward functions defined based on entire images, those based on scan lines are approximately 100 times faster, depending on the number of pixels in the scan. This significant speed advantage makes the optimization process practical for real-time operation. By focusing on the critical features of scan lines, such as the alignment and consistency between trace and retrace lines, we aim to develop a robust and efficient optimization framework that can consistently yield high-quality imaging across a wide range of conditions."}, {"title": "Imaging regimes for TM AFM", "content": "Depending on probe types, samples, and setup parameters, SPM can operate in either attractive or repulsive mode [8]. In attractive mode, the microscope tip operates predominantly under long-range attractive forces, such as van der Waals (vdW) interactions, without physical contact. This allows high-resolution imaging while minimizing deformation and damage of probes and samples. Conditions that favor attractive mode include small amplitudes, larger and less sharp tips, and slower but more sensitive and higher quality factors. Probes often transition from repulsive to mixed to attractive mode as they wear and the balance of vdW and adhesive forces changes. This mode excels in achieving high resolution, preserving the integrity of delicate materials like biomolecules [32], and is ideal for imaging soft or loosely bound materials. However, it requires precise control of the tip-sample distance, necessitating meticulous calibration and stability. In the operation of SPM, attractive mode is usually characterized by phases above the free-air phase, which is the measured phase when the probe is very far away from the sample surface."}, {"title": "In contrast, large amplitudes, sharp tips and lower quality factors favor a net-repulsive interaction - where strong, short range repulsive forces dominate. In repulsive mode, the tip intermittently contacts the sample surface, resulting in predominantly short-range repulsive forces, including mechanical contact and repulsive vdW forces [8]. This mode provides enhanced sensitivity for measuring mechanical properties, such as stiffness and viscoelasticity, and offers better contrast, making it easier to distinguish different materials or features. However, the physical contact can lead to sample and probe deformation or damage, reducing image resolution and potentially causing irreversible changes to the probe and sample. While repulsive mode is advantageous for mechanical property measurements, it comes with the trade-off of potential sample alteration and reduced resolution. SPM is operated in the repulsive mode when the measured phases are below the free-air phase.", "content": "Because of the tip-shape dependence discussed above, if a probe is initially imaging in repulsive mode, it will often transition from repulsive to mixed to attractive mode as they wear and the balance of vdW and adhesive forces changes. The transition between attractive and repulsive modes can result in high transitory forces [33] and is indicated by phases jumping across the free-air phase.\nIn this work, we focus on optimizing tip wear while still obtaining high spatial resolution. This requires a stable and robust approach to parameter tuning that can adapt to the varying conditions of different samples and imaging modes. Our goal is to develop a method that ensures consistent high-quality imaging across diverse applications, minimizing the trade-offs between resolution, sensitivity, and sample integrity. By leveraging a reward-driven machine learning framework, we aim to emulate the adaptive expertise of human operators, providing a scalable solution to the complex optimization problem in SPM imaging. This approach promises to enhance the efficiency, reliability and autonomy of SPM, making it more accessible and effective for a wide range of scientific and industrial applications."}, {"title": "Define the parameter space and reward function", "content": "Below we discuss the relationship between different SPM modes, scan quality, safety of the sample and probe, and the tip-sample distance. In SPM, the tip-sample distance is controlled by the ratio between the setpoint amplitude ($A_{setpoint}$) and free-air amplitude ($A_{drive}$"}, {"title": "also known as free amplitude) so the discussion of the physical mechanisms will be guided by the ratio of setpoint amplitude and free-air amplitude.", "content": "When the tip is far away from the sample surface (large $A_{setpoint}/A_{drive}$), there are no forces between tip and sample. Consequently, the probe is oscillating far above the sample surface instead of following the surface profile, leading to phases close to the free-air phase and random height traces as shown in Figure 2c, subjected to either small drift or other noise in the signal.\nAs the tip gets closer to the sample surface (smaller $A_{setpoint}/A_{drive}$), SPM works in the attractive mode and there are typically long-range attractive forces arising between the tip and surface. This attractive force will decrease the amplitude of the cantilever to the setpoint amplitude at a fixed tip-sample distance, as shown in Figure 2d. As a result, the trace and retrace lines follow closely the sample surface profile with reasonably high spatial resolution and the phases are above the free-air phase. In addition, the force between the tip and sample is kept at a small, net-attractive value and that helps minimize tip and sample damage. This mode is the goal for this work.\nWhen the tip gets even closer to the sample surface (smaller $A_{setpoint}/A_{drive}$), SPM jumps between attractive mode and repulsive mode as the interaction between the tip and sample jumps between the long-range attractive forces and short-range repulsive forces. Consequently, there are sudden jumps in the phase traces across the free-air phase in this crossover mode, as shown in Figure 2b. A previous study showed that the transition between attractive and repulsive mode can result in very high transitory forces between the tip and the sample [33] .As a result, the trace and retrace lines match poorly due to the high transitory forces when the phase jumps occur in Figure 2e.\nWhen $A_{setpoint}/A_{drive}$ is further decreased, the interaction between the tip and sample is more likely to be completely dominated by the short-range repulsive forces. In this mode, the phases are below the free-air phase most of time. The spatial resolution is suppressed and the tip wears off quickly due to the large forces between the tip and sample, as shown in Figure 2f.\nBased on the basic physical principles of SPM discussed above, we define the reward function based on four components derived from the trace and retrace scan lines of the height and phase channels. The height alignment term quantifies the agreement between the trace and retrace lines in the height channel. The phase term measures if the probe is operating in the attractive mode by detecting the presence of phase angles below the free-air phase. The distance term favors lower probe heights to make sure the probe is as close to the sample surface as possible. Finally, the contrast term tries to maximize the amount of information acquired by favoring a large contrast in the height channels. Assembling all these components together, we define the reward function based on a pair of trace and retrace lines of height and phase channels as following equation:\nRewards = -log(|$h_{trace}$ \u2013 $h_{retrace}$|) \u00d7log($N_{e<0free}/N_{e>0free}$) \u00d7 log($h_{min}$ \n\u2013 $h_{global min}$) + log($\\sigma_{traces}$)\n(1)"}, {"title": "where $h_{trace}$ and $h_{retrace}$ are the trace and retrace height scan lines, $N_{e<0 free}$ and $N_{e>0free}$ are the number of pixels in the phase scan lines below (repulsive mode) and above (attractive mode) the free phase angles, $h_{min}$ is the lowest probe position of current trace and retrace height lines while $h_{global min}$ is the global lowest probe position computed based on all the acquired scan lines, $\\sigma_{traces}$ is the standard deviation of the height lines to represent the contrast.", "content": "When the probe is far away from the sample surface and only very weakly interacting with the sample, the traces will be dominated by cantilever sensor noise. Sensor noise will generally have little or no correlation between trace and retrace. The resulting height traces agree poorly with each other and the distance between the probe and sample is large as shown in Figure 2c. Therefore, both the height alignment term and distance term give bad reward values to signal a bad scan. In the attractive mode, every component in our reward function gives good rewards as the height traces align well, the phases are consistently above the free-air phase, the probe is close to the sample surface, and there is a reasonable amount of contrast, as shown in Figure 2d. In the crossover mode as shown in Figure 2e, the phases below the free-air phase leads to a bad reward in the phase term. In the repulsive mode as shown in Figure 2f, most of the pixels in the scan lines show phases below the free-air phase, giving a very small reward to prevent the SPM from working in this mode.\nIn summary, our proposed reward function accurately distinguishes between a set of good topography scanning parameters in the attractive mode from bad parameters in other modes. In addition, it also leaves the flexibility to adjust the weight of different components to fine-tune for different applications."}, {"title": "Reward based optimization and results", "content": "We employed Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the scanning parameters, focusing on two key parameters: free-air amplitude and setpoint, under consistent conditions. In addition to the physical knowledge about SPM that we encoded into the reward function, we found it necessary to guide the optimization process with human empirical knowledge, especially on defining the parameter space.\nTo set up a high-resolution scan in the attractive mode, human operators usually start with a small driving voltage and a large setpoint that ensures gentle force between the probe and sample. The smallest free amplitude can be estimated by the roughness of the sample in the given scan size. Then the setpoint is decreased from a large starting value until the trace and retrace lines agree with each other and thus follow the corrugation of the sample surface. Once the free-air amplitude and setpoint are determined, human operators can also increase the integral gain (I gain) as high as possible without the PI loop becoming unstable and oscillatory.\nInitially, we defined the parameter space based on the type of probe and the estimated roughness of the sample in the given scan size. For instance, with the Tap300G probe and TiO2 nanoparticles, the free-air amplitude was constrained between 0.15 nm and 5.9 nm, and the setpoint ranged between 10% and 90% of the free-air amplitude.\nOnce the parameter space was established, we randomly sampled 10 points within this space to serve as the initial seeding points. The microscope was then controlled via code to measure the scan lines at these parameters, from which the reward function could be computed, as illustrated in Figure 3a. Using the reward values from these seeding points, we fitted an initial Gaussian process (GP) model. This model predicted the distribution and uncertainty of the reward function across the entire parameter space. Subsequently, the acquisition of expected improvement (EI) was computed based on these predictions and uncertainties as shown in Figure 3b-c, determining the next set of parameters to be measured by maximizing the El acquisition function.\nTo account for human empirical knowledge of starting the optimization with small free-air amplitude and large setpoint, we masked the acquisition function in the parameter space to enhance the preference on the parameters with smaller free-air amplitude and larger setpoint, as shown in Figure 4c. The scanning parameters were then updated to the new set without interrupting the scan. The reward value for these new parameters was calculated from the newly"}, {"title": "acquired trace and retrace scan lines. This new parameters-reward pair was added to the previously collected data to retrain and update the GP model. This iterating process of measuring and fitting was repeated until the maximum number of exploration steps was reached or the scan quality became satisfactory.", "content": "Finally, the optimized parameters were used to conduct a full scan to ensure they produced a high-quality image for the entire scan area. As demonstrated in Figures 3e-f, the optimized scanning parameters, determined after 10 seeding steps and 30 exploration steps, yielded high-resolution images with stable operation in the attractive mode. In addition, because the scanning parameters were updated in a non-interruption manner, the optimization was finished within the time of two scans."}, {"title": "More challenging samples \u2013 water droplets", "content": "After verifying the functionality of our reward-driven optimization workflow on the TiO2 nanoparticles, we switched to a water droplet sample to challenge our reward-driven workflow. The water droplet on a mica substrate serves as an excellent testing sample for our autonomous optimization workflow. First, the image quality of water droplets is highly sensitive to the tip-sample distance. If the distance is too large, the probe cannot accurately follow the height profile of droplets. Conversely, if the tip-sample distance is too small, a liquid bridge forms between the tip and the droplet, resulting in distortions in the image. More importantly, tuning the scanning parameters for water droplets is challenging even for experienced SPM operators, as the optimal setpoint amplitude and free-air amplitude are confined to a narrow region in the parameter space.\nDespite these challenges, we were able to find the optimal scanning parameters that give high-quality TM scans of water droplets with our autonomous workflow as shown in Figure 4e-f The sharp images of small droplets indicate a high spatial resolution in the image. The smooth image of the large droplets in the height map together with the phase map above the free-phase reveals that the probe works in the net-attractive mode across the whole image and closely follows the height profile of the droplets without distortion."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Our reward-driven automatic optimization of SPM in tapping mode represents a significant advancement for the SPM community. This method not only drastically reduces the instrument time required to tune different probes on various samples but also ensures the acquisition of high-quality and highly reproducible SPM images. This automation increases the application and accessibility of SPM by eliminating the need for extensive manual tuning. Our study lays the groundwork for automating more complex SPM tasks, such as automating more advanced imaging modes and achieving atomic resolution in ambient environments.\nMoreover, the broader applicability of this reward-driven optimization workflow across the microscopy community has the potential to transform traditionally complex human-led tasks into streamlined, machine learning-based optimization processes. This shift is crucial for the further automation of microscopy, addressing one of the last significant barriers to fully automated microscopes.\nFinally, we anticipate that our workflow will have a profound impact on open science in microscopy. While sharing microscope data alone has provided limited benefits due to the diversity of tasks and applications, the sharing of reward functions introduces a new paradigm. This approach fosters a more integrated and collaborative community, enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of microscopy research.\nThis comprehensive solution not only democratizes access to high-quality SPM imaging but also propels the field towards a future where automated, intelligent systems are the norm, significantly advancing both research and industrial applications."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Technical settings\nFor the implementation in this paper, we made it light enough to run on a local computer with central process unit (CPU) only.

The Co-Association matrix (CA matrix) based method is the mainstream ensemble clustering approach that constructs the similarity relationships between sample pairs according the weak clustering partitions to generate the final clustering result. However, the existing methods neglect that the quality of cluster is related to its size, i.e., a cluster with smaller size tends to higher accuracy. Moreover, they also do not consider the valuable dissimilarity information in the base clusterings which can reflect the varying importance of sample pairs that are completely disconnected. To this end, we propose the Similarity and Dissimilarity Guided Co-association matrix (SDGCA) to achieve ensemble clustering. First, we introduce normalized ensemble entropy to estimate the quality of each cluster, and construct a similarity matrix based on this estimation. Then, we employ the random walk to explore high-order proximity of base clusterings to construct a dissimilarity matrix. Finally, the adversarial relationship between the similarity matrix and the dissimilarity matrix is utilized to construct a promoted CA matrix for ensemble clustering. We compared our method with 13 state-of-the-art methods across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrated the superiority clustering ability and ro- bustness of the proposed approach.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Ensemble clustering (also known as consensus clustering) integrates multiple existing clustering results (referred to as base clusterings) to derive a consensus result that is more accurate and robust than the individual clustering result [1]. As ensemble clustering does not require access to the original data features, it is widely applicable in scenarios involving distributed computation, privacy-preserving, and secure data [2].\nThe co-association (CA) matrix [1], [3], [4], which records pairwise similarity relationships between data points according to the base clusterings, has garnered significant research attention in recent years. The values within this matrix reflect the confidence level that two data points are assigned to the same cluster. Consequently, the CA matrix is often utilized as an adjacency matrix, undergoing hierarchical clustering or spectral clustering to obtain the final clustering results. In the original method [1], the CA matrix is obtained by simply averaging the adjacency matrices produced by the base clusterings. However, this naive approach does not consider the quality of base clusterings or the clusters in each base clustering. Therefore, scholars have proposed numerous methods to enhance the precision of the CA matrix, which can be categorized into three categories: weighting clusterings, weighting clusters, and weighting objects. For the first category, Vladimir [5] proposed a weighting function to evaluate the significance of different base clusterings and theoretically demonstrated that clustering performance improves with the increase in ensemble size. As a representative of methods in weighting clusters, Huang [6] introduced locally weighted ensemble clustering, quantifying cluster entropy by the fragmentation of clusters and proposing an inverse relationship between cluster weight and entropy. More references on weighting clusterings and weighting clusters can be found in [7]. Regarding weighting objectives methods, most methods utilize optimization algorithms to improve the overall CA matrix. For example, Jia [8] considered the neighbor relationships with high-confidence samples and proposed a CA matrix self-enhancement model. In [9], inspired by neighborhood high-order and topological similarity theories, Xu designed an adaptive high-order topological weight method to address the deficiency in handling missing connections in base clustering results. Zhou [10] first introduced the idea of utilizing consensus results to refine base clusterings and further improved this idea by employing manifold ranking to diffuse representation across the multiplex graph [11].\nMotivation: Despite the significant success of the aforementioned methods, they still suffer from the following two issues.\n1) They ignore that the quality of the each cluster is highly related to the size of the cluster. As indicated by Fig. 1. the clusters with smaller size tend to have higher precision, and vice versa\n2) They neglect the dissimilarity relationships of the base clusterings. Dissimilarity can evaluate sample pairs that are not directly connected, thereby providing a more detailed reflection of the cluster structure.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method named Similarity and Dissimilarity Guided Co-Association matrix construction (SDGCA), aimed at obtaining an promoted adjacency matrix that fully reflects the relationships between sample points. First, we evaluate the quality of each cluster by normalized ensemble entropy, which effectively compensates for the shortcomings of existing methods in determining cluster weights without considering cluster sizes. Second, random walk is utilized to obtain a dissimilarity relationship matrix for sample pairs. Note that in the CA matrix with a value of 0, all base clusterings do not consider the sample pair to be clustered, but this direct connectivity being 0 does not imply that their indirect connectivity is also 0. Therefore, we need to characterize how likely the sample pair can be separated using a relationship (in this paper, we use dissimilarity). Finally, we find that the above constructed similarity relationships and dissimilarity relationships naturally constitute an adversarial interaction, i.e., a larger (resp. smaller) value in the similarity relation implies a smaller (resp. larger) value in the dissimilarity relation. Through this adversarial prior, we separately learn a promoted similarity matrix and dissimilarity matrix, construct the final adjacency matrix and apply hierarchical clustering for it to obtain the final clustering result. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022\tWe observe that the quality of each cluster is highly related to the cluster size, and propose the normalized ensemble entropy to depict the similarity relationship.\n\u2022\tA novel perspective for ensemble clustering is proposed by introducing dissimilarity to enhance clustering quality.\n\u2022\tWe develop a new adversarial learning model to obtain the final adjacency matrix.\n\u2022\tComparative analysis with 13 state-of-the-art methods across 12 datasets demonstrates the superior performance and robustness to hyper-parameters of the proposed method."}, {"title": "II.

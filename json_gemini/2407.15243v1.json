{"title": "Genetic Algorithm to Optimize Design of Micro-Surgical Scissors", "authors": ["Fatemeh Norouziani", "Veerash Palanichamy", "Shivam Gupta", "Onaizah Onaizah"], "abstract": "Microrobotics is an attractive area of research as small-scale robots have the potential to improve the precision and dexterity offered by minimally invasive surgeries. One example of such a tool is a pair of micro-surgical scissors that was developed for cutting of tumors or cancerous tissues present deep inside the body such as in the brain. This task is often deemed difficult or impossible with conventional robotic tools due to their size and dexterity. The scissors are designed with two magnets placed a specific distance apart to maximize deflection and generate cutting forces. However, remote actuation and size requirements of the micro-surgical scissors limits the force that can be generated to puncture the tissue. To address the limitation of small output forces, we use an evolutionary algorithm to further optimize the performance of the scissors. In this study, the design of the previously developed untethered micro-surgical scissors has been modified and their performance is enhanced by determining the optimal position of the magnets as well as the direction of each magnetic moment. The developed algorithm is successfully applied to a 4-magnet configuration which results in increased net torque. This improvement in net torque is directly translated into higher cutting forces. The new configuration generates a cutting force of 58 mN from 80 generations of the evolutionary algorithm which is a 1.65 times improvement from the original design. Furthermore, the developed algorithm has the advantage that it can be deployed with minor modifications to other microrobotic tools and systems, opening up new possibilities for various medical procedures and applications.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Minimally invasive surgery, often referred to as keyhole surgery, has become increasingly prevalent in contemporary medical practices due to the numerous advantages it offers [1]. It reduces trauma, minimizes scarring, reduces risks associated with infection, and accelerates recovery time [2]. The robotic instruments currently employed in minimally invasive surgical procedures lack flexibility across various applications and are not designed to perform effectively through small incisions [3]. The last decade has seen a lot of advances in the field of small-scale robotics with sizes ranging from micrometers to millimeters. These robots are useful as they can easily travel through small incisions or can be deployed through injections and perform a variety of operations such as targeted drug delivery [4], brachytherapy [5], and biopsy [6].\nMagnetically actuated tools hold significant promise for executing challenging surgeries through small incisions, as they can be controlled wirelessly from outside the body, offering high levels of dexterity and precision. One such tool"}, {"title": "II. METHODS", "content": "The physical model of the scissors along with the algorithm design and fitness function are presented in this section.\n\nThe physical principles of the scissors are modeled as a torque balance. The force between two dipoles i and j having magnetic moment mi and mj can be modelled as:\n$F_{ij} = \\frac{3\\mu_0}{4\\pi r_{ij}^5} [5(m_i \\cdot r_{ij})m_j + (m_j \\cdot r_{ij})m_i +(m_i \\cdot m_j)r_{ij} - \\frac{5(m_i \\cdot r_{ij})(m_j \\cdot r_{ij}) }{r_{ij}^2}r_{ij}]$\n(1)\nwhere rij is a vector from mi to mj and rij is the mag-nitude of rij. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the interaction forces and torques between the magnets.\nIf Ri is a vector from the pivot point to any dipole i, then the resulting torque from the interaction force given above in Equation 1 can be calculated as:\n$T_{fi} = R_i \\times F_{ij}$\nThe torque generated by dipole mi on m; is given by:\n$T_{ij} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi r_{ij}^5} [3m_j \\times (m_i \\cdot r_{ij})r_{ij} - r_{ij}^2 (m_j \\times m_i)]$\n(3)\nWhen no external field is applied, the scissors are in an equilibrium which can be represented as:\n$T_{fi} + T_{ij} - k\\rho_0 = 0$\n(4)\nHere, k denotes the spring constant of the nitinol wire, po denotes the initial deflection of the spring when no external field is applied.\nIf an external magnetic flux density B is applied then torque on a magnet with magnetic moment mi is given by:\n$T_{mi} = m_i \\times B$\n(5)\nTherefore, the total torque on the scissors' blade is given by:\n$T_{net} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} (T_{fi} + T_{ij} + T_{mi})$\n(6)\nHere, i, j represents th nth magnet where n is taken as 4 for this study. Moreover, i \u2260 j and any components of Tij in the equation above should be discarded for magnets on the same blade. For example, if magnets 1 and 2 are on the same blade, the 712 is discarded from the above equation as magnets on the same blade have no relative motion and will not contribute to net torque on the blade.\n\nThe parameters we are trying to optimize are the magnet position and the orientation of each magnet which can be represented by a 3n genetic vector of the shape:\n<X1, Y1, Mx1,..., Xn, Yn, \u03b8\u03b7 >\nwhere xi, Yi represent the x and y position of the ith magnet while 0 represents the orientation of the magnet from the positive x-axis. Note that the magnetization vector m is calculated from the angle \u03b8i using the trigonometric relationships which are then used in the equations.\nIn this case, the net torque is taken as the fitness function that will be maximized and is shown in Equation 6. A penalty of value p is subtracted from the fitness score if an individual solution represents an invalid configuration. Two ways for an invalid configuration to occur are when either one or more of the magnets are outside the allowed region (blade geometry) or if they are placed less than one magnet distance away from each other.\nSince we want the scissors to be able to open to the same separation level as the original design when a magnetic field is not present, we will have to make sure the magnetic interaction torque (Tfi+Tij) is less than the threshold torque that would result in having a smaller separation between the scissor blades. This check is also done during fitness evaluation and given a penalty if violated.\nThe initial population is generated randomly using a uniform distribution while making sure they are within the boundaries of the scissors and do not have magnets that are too close. The population for the next generation is based on the previous generation. The population evolves solely based"}, {"title": "III. RESULTS", "content": "The generational convergence of the algorithm is tracked using maximum fitness scores for each configuration which is shown in Figure 3. Most of the evolution happens early, before 40 generations, where it follows a linear progression. The algorithm seems to converge around 80 generations to an optimal fitness of 5E-3 as shown in Figure 3. After this convergence, further training is less likely to improve our fitness significantly. The maximum fitness of 5.5E-3 represents a maximum torque Tmax of 5.5 mN-m for a single blade. Since this total torque does not include the restoring torque from the nitinol wire in our fitness calculation, the resulting torque can then be calculated using:\n$T_{final} = T_{max} + T_{spring}$\n(7)\nwhere Tspring = kpo, and k is the spring constant that can be calculated from the specifications of the nitinol wire. Solving Equation 7 gives us a torque of 4.6 mN-m, from which the force is calculated for a single blade. The resulting"}, {"title": "IV. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, we have shown that it is possible to use genetic evolution to create an adaptable algorithm that can help generate design parameters for microrobots. We specif-ically applied our methodology to generate magnet position and orientation to improve the design of our previously developed minimally invasive micro-surgical scissors. The new proposed configuration has 4 magnets compared to the 2 magnets seen in the original. This new design can generate approximately 1.65 the cutting force of the original scissors at 58 mN. Our optimal configuration also allows the option for the device to be scaled down while keeping similar cutting forces of 35 mN that are seen in the original design which is an important and desirable characteristic of microrobot design.\nFuture work will be done to redefine this problem using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Such an algorithm might be more suitable because the scissors need to be able to open by themselves when a magnetic field is not present in order to use only control input. Magnet configurations that improve the maximum cutting torque negatively affect the restoring torque of the scissors. This demands a 2-objective maximization problem which can provide a more diverse solution set. Future research will also be done to extend our algorithm to other types of devices [13], [14] that may need similar design optimization."}]}

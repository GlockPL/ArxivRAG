Sai chandana", "Binoy Krishna Roy"], "abstract": "In today's digital age, cyberspace has become integral to daily life, however it has also led to an increase in cybercriminal activities. This paper explores cybercrime trends and highlights the need for cybercrime awareness (cyberawareness) to mitigate vulnerabilities. The study also examines Indian statistics on cybercrime. We review the existing literature on cybercrime and cybersecurity, focusing on various types of cybercrimes and their impacts. We present a list of 31 technical as well as Common man solutions, considering that they are not technologically updated. Expanding the list of solutions and validating their effectiveness in cyber threats can be the future scope of the research.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In today's digital civilization, cyberspace (also known as the internet world) is used extensively. However, with an ever-increasing digital footprint, cybercriminal activities have also increased [1, 4]. Therefore, the topic of cybersecurity has become a topic of great interest for researchers and practitioners [1]. Cybersecurity is when a crime is committed where a computer is used as a tool or when a computer is subject to a crime [4].\nThe vast majority of political, financial, and military organizations, among many others, process a great deal of sensitive [13, 14]. As such, organizations and Governments around the globe are racing towards research in the field of cyber security to protect themselves against any emerging or future threats [7]. According to recent studies [14] in the United States, healthcare has become the top industry to be compromised, among many others.\nThe rest of the paper is structured in the following way: Section 2 introduces other relevant studies in the field; Section 2.3 provides our solutions; Section 4 is where the discussions are conducted; Section 5 gives a conclusion of the research with future outlook."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Cybercrime", "content": "M Humayun et al. conducted a systematic mapping study of 66 primary studies to identify common cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Their research concluded that most selected studies target only a few common security vulnerabilities such as phishing, denial of service, and malware [1].\nJ Srinivas et al. discussed various aspects of cybersecurity, including cyber attacks, security requirements, and the architecture of cybersecurity incident management frameworks (CIMF). They emphasized the importance of standardization in cybersecurity and outlined challenges in implementing these standards. Their paper also reviewed government policies and provided recommendations for improving cybersecurity measures and defence strategies [2].\nV Sharma et al. examined the surge in cyber-crimes amid rapid technological growth. They categorized cybercrimes, such as hacking and phishing, and highlighted the lack of significant correlation between demographics and awareness. Based on a survey of 134 residents in Delhi and NCR, their study underscored the need for enhanced public awareness and security measures to combat cybercrime in the digital age [3].\nIn his paper, \"Cyber Crime in India: An Empirical Study,\" S Ahmad provided an extensive overview of cybercrime and its legal framework in India. The study highlighted the increasing prevalence of cybercrime, a phenomenon where computers are used as tools or targets for illegal activities. The paper discussed the evolution of cybercrime laws in India, notably the Information Technology Act of 2000, which addressed e-commerce, electronic governance, and penalties for computer-related crimes [4].\nP Shah and A Agarwal investigated the cybersecurity behaviour of smartphone users in India. Their study identified 28 key cybersecurity practices through a literature review and surveyed 300 users. The research found that while users adopt basic security measures like screen locks, they often neglect advanced controls such as encryption. Significant differences in security practices were observed based on factors like gender, age, and mobile OS. The study highlighted a gap in advanced cybersecurity practices and emphasised the need for targeted intervention programs for Indian smartphone users [5].\nBahuguna et al. evaluated the cybersecurity maturity of Indian organizations, highlighting significant gaps despite national efforts like the Cyber Essentials program and India's National Cybersecurity Policy 2013. Their research underscored challenges such as limited budgets, insufficient skilled personnel, and inadequate management support, aligning with broader findings that emphasize the need for robust policies, enhanced technical controls, and increased capacity building to effectively address cybersecurity threats [6].\nIn reviewing the landscape of Indian cybersecurity research from 1999 to 2020, Elango et al. conducted a scientometric analysis based on the Scopus database. Their study revealed a significant increase in publication output, especially in recent years, with a notable shift from data-centric topics to emerging areas such as machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. They found that conference papers are the predominant publication type and identified key authors, institutions, and international collaborations. Their analysis positioned India as a major player in the field, ranking fourth globally in research output, underscoring the country's evolving focus in cybersecurity research [7]."}, {"title": "2.2 Types of Cybercrimes", "content": "We have handpicked a list of 31 common cybercrimes for our study [4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and the list is as follows:\n1.

Zero-Day Exploits: Attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or hardware.\nTable 2 presents notable examples of all 31 common cybercrimes. Each of these examples is mostly taken from the Indian context."}, {"title": "2.3 General Trends of Cybercrime", "content": "The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), under the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Government of India, is a very good source for statistics on crimes in India, including cybercrimes. Much of the volume 2 of the NCRB has many sections dedicated entirely to cybercrimes. One disadvantage of NCRB's data is that there is no latest data after 2022.\nAs can be observed in Figure 1, there has been a steady increase in cybercrimes against women and children. Figure 2 and Table 1 visually and textually present the percentage per state of cybercrimes in India for the year 2018 [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The NCRB's data stopped publishing the percentage per state data from 2020 onwards, hence the 2018 data. It can be observed that most of the cybercrimes are centred around the states of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, with 27.1% and 25.7%, respectively, making up more than 50% of the country (52.8% to be precise). The assumption we can make for this is due to the presence of tier-1 cities in these states: Bangalore and Noida [21], where a lot of the cyber/internet activity is present. Bangalore was the first city in India to have a Cybercrime Police Station [22]."}, {"title": "2.4 Significance of Cybercrime Awareness", "content": "According to Curtis and Colwell, the risk of cybercrimes decreases proportionately to the more aware they are. The risk in cyberspace can be reduced by educating young people about cybercrimes [23, 3]."}, {"title": "3 Solutions of Common Cybercrimes", "content": "In light of these studies, we propose 31 technical and non-technical solutions for 31 common cybercrimes. The solutions are available in Table 3."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Our technical and non-technical solutions presented in Table 3 encompass many common cybercrimes (31 to be precise) but it does not capture all the cybercrimes, this can be where future studies could be conducted. In Table 1, the vast majority of cybercrimes are centred around the states of Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The reason for this could further be investigated as a future study. In our research, as seen in Figure 1, we have found data for specific numbers of crimes against women and children; this can be further expanded for better insights and clarifications. The solutions we offer can be researched to see if these bring about a positive change in society, showcasing a possible future research scope."}, {"title": "5 Conclusions", "content": "In this research, we examined cybersecurity trends and the importance of cyber awareness in mitigating vulnerabilities. We presented 31 Technical as well as Non-Technical Solutions for 31 common cybercrimes. Spreading awareness of these 31 solutions can help the common man be more secure from growing cybercrimes. Future research could focus on expanding these solutions or validating the effectiveness of the proposed measures."}]}

K-12 educators recognize\nthe need to teach students about its capabilities and limi-\ntations(Ng et al. 2023a). Existing AI education efforts focus\non dedicated curricula and professional learning for teachers\n(Amplo and Butler 2023; Lee and Perret 2022). However,\nmany teachers face challenges, such as limited Al knowl-\nedge, time constraints, and resource availability, especially\noutside of computer science classes (Walsh et al. 2023; Song\net al. 2022). Scalable and adaptable resources are needed\nto help teachers incorporate AI into their lessons without\nrequiring deep technical expertise. To address these chal-\nlenges, the Active AI team explored the development of\nmodular AI resources, combined with Project Based Learn-\ning (PBL), which has brought positive feedback in student\nlearning (Kong, Cheung, and Tsang 2024), so that teachers\ncan adapt to their subjects, allowing them to introduce AI\nliteracy in more flexible units (Tseng et al. 2024b). We con-\nducted interview and co-design sessions with teachers from\nvarious backgrounds to investigate three key questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: What is the AI literacy level of K-12 teachers?\n\u2022 RQ2: How do IT and interdisciplinary course instructors\ndesign lesson plans using our PBL toolkit?\n\u2022 RQ3: How do differences in teachers' and students'\nbackgrounds influence their perspectives on AI tools, stu-\ndent performance, and course design?\nTo answer these questions, this paper presents a formative\nempirical evaluation of teachers' perspectives on AI literacy,\nproviding insights that can inform the development of adapt-\nable AI tools to support AI literacy education across diverse\nsubject areas."}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": ""}, {"title": "AI Literacy Curriculum", "content": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integral\nto a wide array of applications, it is essential for K-12 stu-\ndents to understand how to interact with these technologies\nand recognize their capabilities and limitations (Ng et al.\n2023a; Eguchi, Okada, and Muto 2021). Prior work has in-\nvestigated AI curricula beyond computer science and pro-\ngramming, focusing on creative, human-centered aspects of\nAI (Eaton et al. 2018; Walsh et al. 2023). These cross-\ndisciplinary AI curricula aim to make AI education more\naccessible to students from various backgrounds.\nMany researchers have launched co-design collaborations\nto develop AI literacy curricula (Williams et al. 2023; Amplo\nand Butler 2023; Bilstrup et al. 2022). Amplo and Butler\nhighlighted the importance of profound collaborations with\nteachers, where educators play an active role in shaping the\ncurriculum while gaining more knowledge about the field.\nSuch partnerships empower teachers as creators that could\ntailor new curricula to student needs and interests, instead\nof just implementers of AI curricula (Lee and Perret 2022;\nDiPaola et al. 2023).\nFor example, Walsh et al. found that literacy and STEM\nteachers with minimal AI experience were able to adapt an\nAI ethics curriculum, suggesting that Al knowledge is not\na prerequisite for curricular co-design. Co-designing AI ed-\nucation curricula with cross-disciplinary high school teach-\ners has been shown to enhance the relevance and adaptabil-\nity of the curriculum (Lin and Van Brummelen 2021).

Students can up-\nload their own image datasets and, following step-by-step\ninstructions, generate their own images. AI Music Studio al-\nlows students to create music based on a teacher-assigned\ntopic.

These teachers also recognize the fast-paced AI\ntechnology and the possibility of gaps in their knowledge.\nThey further discussed their understanding of Al's capa-\nbilities and limitations in education. The most commonly\nmentioned AI capability is its potential to serve as a self-\nstudying assistant to students, whether as a conversational\ntutoring tool (Stamper, Xiao, and Hou 2024) or by providing\ndrafts and initial prompts for student projects.

First, while\nmany teachers are confident in understanding Al's basic ca-\npabilities, they still face challenges, especially with stu-\ndents' varying AI skill levels. Teachers with higher AI lit-\neracy were better able to integrate the toolkit into their lesson\nplans, using tools like the AI Chatbot to foster independent\nlearning and critical thinking. However, those with lower AI\nliteracy tended to focus more on ethical concerns and proper\nAI use, both of them lack of AI educational knowledge, such\nas knowing the AI for K-12 framework and 5 big ideas. in-\ndicating a need for more training and support for both stu-\ndents and instructors in AI education. Another takeaway is\nthat students' opportunities to learning AI Literacy at\nschool might not be significantly varied by their eco-\nomic status. Instructors teaching lower-income students\nshowed success in guiding their students properly through\nAI tools and produce satisfying study results, despite re-\nsource constraints, which challenges assumptions about ac-\ncess and technological inequality.\nAlthough the toolkit offers adaptivity, flexibility, and cre-\nativity, concerns about the dependency of the AI tool, the\naccuracy of AI-generated content, and legal issues such as\ncopyrights need to be addressed. Teachers also raised the\nneed for more support and onboarding, particularly in using\nmore advanced features.\nThere are limitations in this research that should be con-\nsidered when interpreting the findings, including a small\nsample size and limited diversity, which may affect the gen-\neralizability of the findings. Future studies should involve a\nbroader demographic for a more comprehensive understand-\ning of AI literacy challenges. Future work could also focus\non improving teacher training to enhance AI literacy, offer-\ning clearer classroom guidance, addressing ethical concerns,\nand making the toolkit scalable for diverse educational set-\ntings."}]}

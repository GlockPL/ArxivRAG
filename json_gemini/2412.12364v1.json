We examine them from three directions."}, {"title": "2.1 Semantic Approach of Log Integration", "content": "Traditional semantic approaches to log integration face significant challenges, primarily because they must handle log data from many different sources, each with its own format and structure [Cal\u00ec et al.(2005), Ekelhart et al.(2018b)]. These methods often are not scalable enough to keep up with the massive amounts of log data generated by modern systems. Additionally, log events are highly specific to the context in which they occur, making it difficult to automate their interpretation. As a result, these limitations prevent semantic analysis from capturing key insights, especially when dealing with modern cyber threats and complex systems.\nSEPSES is a semantic log analysis framework that offers a platform for semantic-based security monitoring, auditing, and forensic investigations [Ekelhart et al.(2018a)]. It uses JSON-LD (JSON for Linking Data) to consolidate fragmented log information and extract and interlink related to security information. In this system, the log vocabulary stack is one of the key components that enables transforming the raw log data into a uniform RDF (Resource Description Framework) representation [Pan(2009)]. The log vocabulary stack consists of two kinds of terms. One is the core vocabulary, slog: core, the foundation of the basic terms to describe log messages independent from their sources. The other one is the source-specific terms. To provide event specifications, they collect background knowledge, such as syslog events, Apache events, etc.\nThe significant drawback of SPESES is that the log vocabulary and background knowledge are manually collected and added to the system. This limits the system's ability to interpret logs and link events dynamically. Thus, the scalability is a big concern for this system. As the volume of log event data surges, the semantic processing system must scale accordingly, which can be demanding for a system with a static design. Cyber threats constantly evolve, and semantic processing systems need continual updates to understand new patterns and threats. Keeping the system up-to-date requires ongoing effort and adaptation, which can be resource-intensive."}, {"title": "2.2 AI Approach of Log Integration", "content": "AI and machine learning have become increasingly central to integrating log data across different systems, offering enormous improvements in monitoring, security, and operational management efficiency and effectiveness. AI can automatically parse logs from different sources and normalize the data into a consistent format [He et al.(2017a)]. Machine learning models can learn from historical log data to understand normal system behavior. These model can detect anomalies or deviations in new log data, which could indicate potential issues like security breaches or system failures [Chen et al.(2022)]. AI can analyze trends within log data to predict future system behaviors and potential problems. This proactive approach enables preemptive maintenance and security measures, minimizing downtime and preventing breaches before they occur [Han et al.(2023)].\nThere are numerous commercial and opensource tools for automatically analyzing log files, such as Sem-text Logs [Giamattei et al.(2024)], SolarWinds Loggly [Wagner and Ramachandran(2021)], Splunk [Splunk(2021)], Rapid7 InsightOps [Rapid7 InsightOps([n. d.])], and Sumo Logic [Sumo Logic(2024)]. These tools offer centralized log management, allowing users to collect, store, and analyze logs from various sources, with most providing cloud-based solutions. There are approaches which look at LLM based solutions as well [Gao et al.(2023)]. They include search functionality and analytics features to help users gain insights from the data, as well as alerting systems to notify users of important events or anomalies. Additionally, they offer data visualization through charts, dashboards, or other graphical representations.\nHowever, these tools often have drawbacks, such as being overly complex, offering limited log management capabilities, and performing poorly when handling large volumes of data or long-term retention. These difficulties highlight the trade-offs in log management tools, which are influenced by specific needs, technical expertise, and budget constraints."}, {"title": "2.3 Log Analysis", "content": "The traditional approach to log analysis starts with log parsing, an essential step for preparing log data for further analysis. A notable method in this area is \u201cDrain\u201d, an online log parsing technique designed to speed up this process [He et al.(2017a)]. After parsing, the next step is log-based anomaly detection, which includes extracting relevant features and then using these features in a machine-learning model to identify and predict anomalous events [Chen et al.(2022)]. These steps represent a foundational framework in the current landscape of log analysis technology.\nHowever, traditional methods primarily focus on detecting anomalies. \u201cLogGPT\u201d [Han et al.(2023)] is a novel ap-proach in which a model is trained to predict the next log entry based on previous sequences.

LogBabylon excels in accurately extracting log templates due to the LLMs' advanced comprehension abilities. It strategically utilizes LLMs to optimize performance and minimize resource consumption. Designed for versatility, LogBabylon adapts to various log formats and domains while minimizing human intervention in tasks, such as data labeling and parameter tuning. Furthermore, it incorporates a dynamic feedback loop to refine the parsing granularity based on human input, ensuring accurate and efficient log analysis.\nThe LogBabylon framework consists of a sequence of progressive steps: classification, consolidation, and interpretation. Figure 1 demonstrates high-level architecture design of LogBabylon."}, {"title": "3.1 Classification", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1.1 Overview", "content": "LogBabylon employs a streamlined pre-processing approach that minimizes the need for extensive domain expertise. Unlike methods that rely heavily on regular expressions to replace specific variables, such as IP addresses [He et al.(2017b)], LogBabylon retains the original log message, allowing the LLM to fully grasp its context. This approach, which uses plain space-based tokenization and leverages the LLM's native tokenizer [Fu et al.(2022), Yu et al.(2023)], simplifies preprocessing while maintaining high log parsing efficiency."}, {"title": "3.1.2 Algorithm", "content": "LogBabylon's core algorithm centers on a prefix parse tree [He et al.(2017b)]. This tree structure efficiently matches incoming logs with existing clusters, thereby facilitating the rapid identification of similar entries. The algorithm intelligently determines when to invoke the LLM for template extraction, optimizing resource usage. As the LLM identifies new templates, the tree dynamically updates to incorporate these findings, ensuring an accurate and evolving representation of the log data. This sophisticated approach enables LogBabylon to effectively process and analyze logs by combining the strengths of the prefix parse tree and the LLM.\nThree primary data structures form the backbone of our approach: a set of log clusters, a template pool, and a prefix parse tree. Figure 2 visually represents this organizational structure. The subsequent discussion delineates their respective functionalities.\nLog Cluster: A log cluster is a collection of logs with the same template. It tracks the individual log IDs and stores a log embedding created by an LLM encoder for future use. Each cluster is characterized by its log template, extracted via LLM, and possibly multiple syntax templates aiding the prefix tree in its traversal and template matching processes. While syntax templates correspond directly to the tokens of the raw logs, identifying static and variable parts, the log templates from the LLM may represent several tokens with a single placeholder. These syntax templates are stored in a dictionary, utilizing the token counts as keys and the corresponding template lists as values.\nTemplate Pool: The template pool establishes a linkage, mapping log templates to their respective log clusters.\nPrefix Parse Tree: In this tree structure, each node, except the root, represents a token. The wildcard token \"\u00a1*\u00bf\" is a universal matcher for any token. Importantly, the leaf nodes and nearly all nodes (except the root) can have pointers to log clusters that match the token sequence, starting from the root. A notable feature is that a single log cluster may be accessible from multiple nodes due to the possibility of having different syntax template variations for the same log cluster."}, {"title": "3.2 Consolidation", "content": "LogBabylon utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [Lewis et al.(2020)] to enhance its log analysis capabilities. This approach ensures that it does not solely rely on internal knowledge but also leverages a vast collection of \"normal\" log entries to interpret new logs effectively.\nConsider this collection of a comprehensive library of log examples that is efficiently stored in a vector database. When a new log entry arrives, LogBabylon attempts to match it with existing templates and queries this database to find similar past entries.\nThe LLM then conducts a detailed semantic analysis by comparing the new log entry with the retrieved examples. This process allows LogBabylon to:\n\u2022 Identify subtle patterns and anomalies: By comparing the new log with known examples, LogBabylon can detect even minor deviations that may indicate unusual activity.\n\u2022 Understand the log context: The retrieved examples offer valuable context, helping LogBabylon grasp the significance of the new log entry.\n\u2022 Generate more accurate interpretations: The combination of internal knowledge with external examples enables LogBabylon to provide more accurate and insightful interpretations of log data.\nThis RAG-based approach renders LogBabylon a versatile and user-friendly tool for log analysis. Unlike traditional methods that require complex, multi-stage processing pipelines, LogBabylon offers an end-to-end solution that adapts seamlessly to any log source with a minimal configuration. By combining the power of LLMs with a rich knowledge base of log examples, LogBabylon simplifies log analysis and unlocks deeper insights from the data.\nLogBabylon's application of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model can be divided into three steps:"}, {"title": "3.2.1 Finding Relevant Information", "content": "When LogBabylon receives a new log entry, denoted by x, it first seeks contextually relevant log entries from its knowledge base (stored in a vector database) to better understand the new entry. This step leverages dense-vector retrieval.\n\u2022 Turning Logs into Vectors: LogBabylon employs a pre-trained embedding model to convert each log entry into a dense vector representation [Lee et al.(2019)]. These vectors encapsulate the semantic meaning of the logs, enabling comparisons based on meaning rather than on literal words.\n\u2022 Calculating Similarity: To identify relevant logs, LogBabylon compares the vector of the new log entry, x, with the stored vectors in the database. This comparison uses the inner product, a mathematical operation that measures similarity between two vectors.\n\u2022 Retrieving the Best Matches: The database returns the log entries whose vectors have the highest similarity scores to x. This set of relevant log entries is denoted as z."}, {"title": "3.2.2 Generating a Response", "content": "With the relevant context z retrieved for the new log entry x, LogBabylon proceeds to generate a meaningful response, leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM), represented as f.\n\u2022 Combining Input and Context: The LLM takes both the new log entry x and the retrieved relevant logs z as input.\n\u2022 Generating Output: Based on this combined input, the LLM generates a response, y. This response can be an interpretation of the log, an anomaly detection flag, or another task-specific output."}, {"title": "3.2.3 LLM Semantic Analysis in LogBabylon", "content": "Once LogBabylon retrieves relevant log entries from its vector database, it must analyze and compare them with the new log entry. This is where the LLM's semantic analysis capabilities come into play. Figure 3 demonstrates this process.\nDecoding the Vectors\nThe retrieved vectors are first transformed back into their original log entry format. This is achieved using the decoder component of the embedding model, which reverses the encoding process, converting the abstract vector representation into human-readable log text.\nFraming the Anomaly Detection Task\nLogBabylon frames the anomaly detection task as a question-answering problem. This approach leverages the natural ability of LLMs to interpret questions and provide human-like responses.\nCrafting the Prompt\nA specialized prompt template is used to provide structured input to the LLM. The template includes:\n\u2022 The new log entry: The log that LogBabylon is analyzing.\n\u2022 The retrieved normal log entries: These serve as context, offering a baseline for comparison.\n\u2022 The question: The LLM is asked, \u201cIs the new log entry normal or abnormal, given the provided examples of normal logs?\u201d\nLLM Analysis\nThe LLM processes this structured prompt by leveraging its language understanding and contextual reasoning abilities. It determines whether the new log entry deviates from the norm, producing one of the following outputs:\n\u2022 A simple classification: \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d\n\u2022 A detailed explanation: Describing the detected anomaly and its significance.\nBy framing anomaly detection as a question-answering task and harnessing the semantic capabilities of the LLM, LogBabylon can effectively identify unusual log entries, even those with subtle deviations from the expected behavior.

This method operates in iterative cycles, continuously refining agent roles, goals, tasks, workflows, and dependencies based on qualitative and quantitative output evaluation. Moreover, the system is designed with scalability, ensuring its deployment across industries. The LLM-driven feedback loops offer a foundational infrastructure for adapting the system to various NLP applications, ensuring broad applicability across domains. The proposed method's optimization process is guided by two core frameworks: the Synthesis Framework and the Evaluation Framework. Synthesis Framework framework generates hypotheses based on the system's output. The Hypothesis Agent and Modification Agent collaborate to synthesize new configurations for the Agentic AI system, proposing modifications to agent roles, goals, and tasks; to be tested by the Evaluation Framework.\nThe refinement and optimization process is structured into these frameworks, contributing to the continuous improvement of the Agentic AI solution. The proposed method operates autonomously, iterating through cycles of hypothesis generation, execution, evaluation, and modification until optimal performance is achieved. A detailed report of a refinement iteration is provided in Appendix A. This method begins by deploying a baseline version of the Agentic AI system. Agents are assigned predefined roles, tasks, and workflows, and the system generates initial qualitative and quantitative criteria based on the system's objectives. An LLM is used to analyze the system's code and extract evaluation metrics, which serve as benchmarks for assessing future outputs. Human input can be introduced to revise or fine-tune the evaluation criteria to better align with project goals; which is optional, as the method is designed to operate autonomously.\nThe proposed method begins with a baseline version of the Agentic AI system, assigning initial agent roles, goals, and workflows. The first execution is run to generate the initial output and establish the baseline for comparison. After evaluating the initial output, the Hypothesis Agent generates hypotheses for modifying agent roles, tasks, or workflows based on the evaluation feedback. These hypotheses are then passed to the Modification Agent, which synthesizes changes to agent logic, interactions, or dependencies, producing new system variants. The Execution Agent executes the newly modified versions of the system, and performance metrics are gathered. The outputs generated are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative criteria (e.g., clarity, relevance, execution time). The Selection Agent compares the newly generated outputs against the best-known variant, ranks the variants, and determines whether the new output is superior. Memory Module stores The best-performing variants for future iterations. The cycle repeats as the proposed method continues refining the agentic workflows, improving overall performance until predefined or generated (and optionally revised) criteria are satisfied."}, {"title": "Synthesis Framework", "content": "The Refinement Agent manages the iterative optimization process by delegating tasks to other agents and synthesizing hypotheses for improving the system. It evaluates agent outputs against qualitative and quantitative criteria, identifying areas where agent roles, tasks, or workflows can be improved. The Refinement Agent leverages evaluation metrics such as clarity, relevance, depth of analysis, and actionability to propose modifications that enhance system output. The Hypothesis Generation Agent proposes specific changes to the agent system based on the output analysis. This module generates hypotheses for improving agent roles, tasks, and interactions based on evaluation feedback. For example, if agents are underperforming due to inefficiencies in their task delegation, the hypothesis module might suggest altering task hierarchies or reassigning specific roles.\nThe Modification Agent implements changes based on the hypotheses generated by the Refinement Agent. These changes may involve adjusting agent logic, modifying workflows, or altering agent dependencies. By synthesizing these changes, our method creates multiple variants of the Agentic AI solution. Each variant is stored and documented, with details regarding the expected improvements. The Execution Agent runs modified versions of the system, executing the newly generated variants and collecting performance data for subsequent evaluation. It ensures that agents perform their tasks as specified in the new configuration and debug issues as they arise. The Execution Agent tracks qualitative and quantitative outputs, feeding this information into the evaluation process."}, {"title": "Evaluation Framework", "content": "The Evaluation Framework is responsible for assessing the outputs of each system variant. The Evaluation Agent employs Llama 3.2-3B to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the system's performance. The Evaluation Framework ensures that each iteration aligns with the system's overarching objectives, focusing on continuous improvement. The Evaluation Agent assesses the outputs of each system variant using a LLM. The LLM evaluates outputs based on predefined or generated qualitative criteria, including clarity, relevance to the task, depth of analysis, actionability, and quantitative metrics such as execution time and success rate. The Evaluation Agent provides a comprehensive system performance analysis, identifying areas for further improvement. After each iteration, the Selection Agent compares the outputs of the modified system against the best-known configuration.\nIt ranks the new variants based on the evaluation scores provided by the Evaluation Agent, determining which configuration yields the highest performance. The top-ranked variant is stored for future iterations, ensuring continuous improvement."}, {"title": "Refinement Process", "content": "Agentic AI refinement process begins with the initialization of the best-known code variant, denoted as $C_o$, and the generation of its corresponding output, $O_{Co}$. The performance of the output is evaluated using a set of qualitative criteria (e.g., clarity, relevance, depth of analysis), where the evaluation function $f(O_c, criteria)$ produces a score $S(C_o) = f(O_{Co}, criteria)$ based on these criteria. This initial score, $S(C_o)$, is the baseline for comparison in subsequent iterations. At each iteration i, the current best-known output, $O_{C_i}$, is evaluated, and a set of hypotheses, $H_i = generate\\_hypotheses(E_{C_i})$, is generated from the qualitative evaluation $E_{Ci}$ to suggest improvements. The hypotheses $H_i$ are then applied to the code $C_i$, resulting in a new variant $C_{i+1} = M(H_i, C_i)$. The new code variant $C_{i+1}$ is executed, producing a new output $O_{Ci+1}$. The new output is evaluated using the same evaluation function $f(O_c, criteria)$, yielding a new score $S_{i+1} = f(O_{Ci+1}, criteria)$. If the new score $S_{i+1}$ is greater than the best-known score $S_{best} = max(S_{i+1}, S_{best})$, the new variant is considered superior, and the best-known variant is updated as follows. The process continues iteratively until a stopping condition is met, either when the improvement between iterations becomes smaller than a predefined threshold $|S_{i+1} - S_{best}| < \\epsilon$, or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.\nUpon termination, the proposed method returns the best-known variant $C_{best}$ and its output $O_{best}$.\nOnce initialized, the proposed method enters the execution phase, where agents perform their assigned tasks according to the baseline configuration. The Execution Agent runs the system, producing initial outputs that serve as a baseline for comparison in subsequent iterations. The results of this execution phase are stored for future analysis and comparison. The Evaluation Agent evaluates the outputs produced in the execution phase. The proposed method employs qualitative and quantitative criteria to assess the quality of the outputs. Qualitative metrics include relevance, clarity, depth of analysis, and actionability, while quantitative metrics include execution time, task completion rate, and overall system efficiency. The Evaluation Agent uses an LLM to generate detailed feedback, identifying areas where the system can be improved. The Hypothesis Generation Agent analyzes the evaluation data, generating hypotheses for improving agent roles, tasks, and workflows. These hypotheses may include changes such as altering task delegation, modifying agent goals, or restructuring the interdependencies between agents. Once the hypotheses are generated, the Modification Agent implements the proposed changes, creating new system variants based on these modifications. The modified versions of the system are re-executed by the Execution Agent, and the Evaluation Agent again evaluates their outputs. This iterative process continues, with each new variant compared against the previous best-known configuration. The Selection Agent ranks the system variants based on performance, ensuring that the Memory Module only stores the top-performing versions."}, {"title": "Case Studies", "content": "The evolution of agent systems in various domains highlights the need for continuous refinement to meet the dynamic demands of industry standards and user expectations.

Introduction", "content": "The mechanical stability of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfills constitutes a fundamental challenge in geotechnical engineering, particularly given the accelerating rates of waste generation associated with global urbanization trends [1-3]. Landfill stability analysis represents a critical design parameter that significantly influences both the engineering design and operational protocols. The structural integrity of these geotechnical systems is predominantly governed by the waste material's shear strength parameters, specifically cohesion (c) and internal friction angle ($) [4, 5]. The characteristic heterogeneity of MSW compositions, in conjunction with temporal variations induced by progressive biodegradation processes [3, 6, 7], presents substantial challenges in the accurate determination of these parameters through conventional analytical methodologies. While recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have demonstrated promising capabilities in modeling complex geotechnical systems [8, 9], the application of these computational approaches to MSW characterization remains insufficiently investigated. The primary challenge extends beyond the development of predictive algorithms to encompass the necessity for model interpretability and validation in practical engineering contexts. This investigation addresses this knowledge gap through the development of an explainable AI framework optimized for the evaluation of shear strength parameters across heterogeneous MSW compositional matrices.\nContemporary investigations into MSW shear strength characteristics have elucidated substantial variability in mechanical properties, with the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion ($\\tau = c + \\sigma \\tan(\\phi)$) establishing the theoretical foundation for stability analysis [3, 7]. The shear strength characteristics of MSW exhibit primary dependencies on waste composition, unit weight, and degradation kinetics. Empirical investigations have documented substantial variations in cohesion (1.17-40.17 kPa) and friction angles (21.51\u00b0-50.60\u00b0) across diverse experimental conditions [6, 10]. While conventional laboratory methodologies provide critical insights, the inherent heterogeneity of waste matrices presents persistent challenges for behavioral prediction. Experimental investigations by Pulat and Yukselen-Aksoy [11] have demonstrated that elevated paper content in synthetic MSW correlates positively with cohesion while exhibiting an inverse relationship with friction angles, whereas Bray et al. [12] and Chen et al. [13] documented that increased plastic content generally attenuates both parameters. Furthermore, Dixon and Jones [14] established that waste degradation processes typically manifest in diminished cohesion values accompanied by enhanced friction angles, highlighting the temporal evolution of MSW mechanical properties. These complex interdependencies, coupled with thermal sensitivity analyses demonstrating inverse correlations between temperature and cohesion, underscore the necessity for advanced analytical methodologies capable of addressing multivariate relationships and parameter estimation uncertainties in MSW characterization [4, 5]. The accurate prediction of shear strength variations across heterogeneous waste compositions remains a significant challenge in contemporary geotechnical research.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated extensive applications in civil engineering, particularly in predictive modeling and structural damage detection through computer vision [8, 15]. However, the interpretability of AI-generated results remains challenging, leading to the emergence of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). XAI addresses the transparency requirements in AI systems by developing methods to elucidate decision-making processes across"}, {"title": "2. Model architecture", "content": "The model architecture employed in this study was a multi-level perceptron (MLP), a feedforward neural network designed to capture non-linear relationships within the dataset [21]. Given that the municipal solid waste (MSW) data comprised a single time-series dataset with 18 features, the MLP was configured to process input variables representing waste composition, physical properties, and environmental conditions. These features included parameters such as waste type proportions, moisture content, unit weight, and compaction history, which were derived from empirical measurements conducted at the study site. The MLP architecture was optimized through hyperparameter tuning to ensure robust predictive performance while mitigating overfitting risks [21]. The dataset, sourced from the largest Preksa-controlled open dumpsite in Thailand, was preprocessed to normalize feature values and address temporal dependencies inherent in the time-series structure. This preprocessing step ensured compatibility with the MLP's input requirements and enhanced the model's ability to generalize across diverse MSW profiles. The resulting framework not only predicted shear strength parameters with high accuracy but also facilitated interpretability through post-hoc analysis techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which quantified the contribution of individual features to model predictions.

Dataset", "content": "The Praeksa controlled open dumpsite in Samut Prakan province, Thailand, represents a complex waste management facility, as evidenced by comprehensive aerial orthographic imagery and ground-level documentation [22]. The aerial survey (Fig. 1) reveals a sophisticated operational layout with distinct functional zones: an active disposal area marked in cyan forming a curved perimeter, and an inactive zone marked in yellow along the eastern boundary. Two specific monitoring areas, designated as FW (Fresh Waste) and YW (Young Waste) zones, are strategically positioned within the site for waste behavior assessment. The facility's scale is substantial, spanning approximately 300 meters across, with significant elevation variations ranging from 15 meters below grade to 37 meters above the surrounding ground level, creating a total vertical profile of 52 meters.\nThe site's operational complexity is further compounded by critical stability challenges, clearly visible in Fig. 2, which highlights the risk of insufficient stability in a very small portion of the controlled dumpsite. The ground-level photograph reveals problematic geotechnical conditions characterized by tension cracks, deformation, and inadequate structural integrity of the waste mass. These issues are exacerbated by the heterogeneous composition of the municipal solid waste, which includes various materials such as plastics and textiles, contributing to unpredictable shear strength characteristics [10, 23]. The visible steep slope angles and vertical faces in the waste mass indicate potential shear failure planes, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced geotechnical monitoring and improved waste placement procedures.\nThe investigation of shear strength in municipal solid waste through machine learning approaches has become increasingly critical due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of waste materials. As evidenced in Fig. 2, waste components vary significantly, including plastics, textiles, organic matter, paper, and other materials, each with distinct mechanical properties. Traditional geotechnical testing methods often struggle to accurately predict shear strength due to this heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of waste decomposition Machine learning algorithms can process multiple variables simultaneously [24-26], including waste composition percentages, age, degree of decomposition, moisture content, and density, to develop more accurate predictive models for shear strength parameters. This is particularly important because different waste components contribute differently to the overall mechanical behavior - for instance, fibrous materials like textiles and plastics often provide reinforcement effects, while organic matter degradation can lead to significant changes in strength properties over time.\nThe site's daily operations, processing approximately 3,000 Mg of unsorted municipal waste, have created distinct zones based on waste degradation status [22, 27]. The inactive zone contains mature, stabilized waste at least three years old, designated for refuse-derived fuel (RDF) production, while the active zone comprises partially degraded waste less than one year in age, including fresh deposits. The aerial imagery also reveals essential infrastructure supporting daily operations, including access roads and buffer zones separating the facility from surrounding areas. This highlights key operational practices, emphasizing the importance of effective leachate and"}, {"title": "3.1 Shear strength parameters measurement using a direct shear test", "content": "Direct shear testing was implemented as the primary methodology for shear strength determination based on three critical advantages: (1) accommodation of larger specimens (up to 90 cm) enabling representative sampling of MSW heterogeneity, (2) direct measurement of horizontal displacement under controlled normal stress, and (3) simplified specimen preparation compared to triaxial methods. These advantages specifically address the limitations of triaxial testing, which is constrained by specimen size requirements that may underrepresent material variability [5]. Testing protocols adhered to ASTM D3080 specifications for consolidated drained conditions, ensuring standardization and result reproducibility.\nThe testing apparatus design, as illustrated in Fig. 3, prioritized structural rigidity and measurement precision. The frame, constructed from 5\u00d75 cm steel tubing (170 cm \u00d7 40 cm) (component 9), was dimensioned to minimize deflection under loading, while the lower shear box (components 3, 40\u00d740\u00d710 cm internal dimensions, 2 mm steel plate) and upper shear box (components 4, 40\u00d740\u00d735 cm internal dimensions, 2 mm steel plate) incorporated 5 cm reinforcement flanges to maintain geometric stability during testing. Force application system selection was based on precision control requirements, utilizing a YNT-01 linear actuator (component 1, 300 mm extension, 3,000 N maximum force) with pulse-width modulation control to ensure consistent displacement rates. Measurement instrumentation positioning was optimized for accuracy: the 10 kN YLR-3 load ring (component 5) was mounted 10 cm above the box base to minimize moment effects, while the UNI-T LM 50 laser meter (component 2) was positioned at 30 cm height to ensure stable displacement readings. Normal stress conditions (10.00, 15.00 and"}, {"title": "3.2 Data characteristics", "content": "The Fig. 4 offers a comprehensive visualization of waste material distributions and physical properties in municipal solid waste management through a series of 15 histogram distributions. The material compositions reveal several distinct patterns: food waste demonstrates a pronounced right-skewed distribution with maximum frequency in the 0.00-0.05 range, while garden waste exhibits an exponential decay-like pattern concentrated within the 0.00-0.02 interval. The minimize proportion of food and garden waste (organic) represents partially degraded waste agree with [31, 34]. Paper and cardboard waste presents an interesting multimodal distribution with multiple distinct peaks, suggesting various sources or types of paper waste streams. Apart from that is the different waste age and moisture content in waste dump resulting in various of biodegradable phase of paper and cardboard, based on this study measure waste proportion by weight [35]. Textiles show a near-normal distribution centered approximately at 0.05, and plastics display a notable bimodal distribution pattern between 0.40 and 0.70. The high plastics proportion, as a significant waste, represents that the decreasing of organic proportion from biodegradation and transform into soil-likes materials or fine fractions [36]. The physical properties of the waste materials provide additional insights into their characteristics. The particle size distributions, categorized into multiple size ranges (10-15 mm, 5-10 mm, 2-5 mm, and <2 mm), exhibit varying degrees of normality, indicating diverse fragmentation patterns in the waste stream. The moisture content, measured in percentage weight per weight (%w/w), shows a right-skewed distribution with a peak in the 0.50-0.60 range, while density measurements in kN/m\u00b3 approximate a normal distribution centered around 7.00 to represent the controlled open dump density [34, 37]. These patterns reveal important information about the physical nature of the waste materials and their potential handling characteristics.\nThe Fig. 5 illustrates a detailed analysis of feature distributions for outlier detection across diverse waste material categories and physical characteristics. The plot encompasses 16 distinct features along the x-axis, spanning from organic materials like food and garden waste to synthetic materials such as plastics and rubber, along with particle size classifications and moisture content measurements. Each boxplot's structure reveals the statistical distribution, with the box representing the interquartile range (IQR) and the green horizontal line indicating the median, while whiskers extend to non-outlier extremes and circles mark statistical outliers. The analysis reveals several significant patterns: plastics demonstrate the highest median value (approximately 0.43) and the largest IQR, indicating substantial variability in plastic content across samples; moisture content (<%wt/wt) shows notable spread with multiple upper-range outliers, suggesting heterogeneous water distribution due to leachate accumulation from the lack of leachate collection system [22]; and most material categories exhibit positively skewed distributions, as evidenced by outlier concentrations above the upper whiskers. Particle size classifications (ranging from 10-15 mm to <2 mm) display relatively consistent distributions with fewer outliers, indicating more uniform size distribution characteristics. The standardized y-axis scale (0.00-0.8) enables direct comparison between features, facilitating quantitative assessment of relative concentrations and variations across waste material categories. This comprehensive visualization effectively highlights the inherent variability and potential anomalies across different waste material features, providing valuable insights for machine learning-based waste classification and sorting systems."}, {"title": "4. Experiment", "content": "The input features X and target variable y (friction angle and cohesion) were preprocessed using the Min-Max Scaler to linearly transform the data into a standardized range ([0,1]) while preserving the original distribution of the samples. This method was selected to avoid distortions introduced by alternative scaling techniques, such as standardization (which centers data and scales to unit variance, potentially altering relationships) or logarithmic transformation (which non-linearly modifies data structure and may distort skewness or introduce biases for zero/negative values). Both input features and target variables were normalized prior to model training to ensure consistent scaling, mitigate scale-dependent biases in gradient-based optimization algorithms, and retain the statistical properties critical for accurate representation of geotechnical phenomena (e.g., friction angle and cohesion). By maintaining the original distribution, the Min-Max Scaler ensures that the model learns relationships without artificial distortions, which is particularly important for tasks requiring precise physical interpretation.\n$X_{scaled} = \\frac{X-X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}}$ (16)\n$y_{scaled} = \\frac{y-y_{min}}{y_{max}-y_{min}}$ (17)\nThe model was trained using the AdamW optimizer, a variant of the Adam algorithm that decouples weight decay from gradient-based updates, thereby enhancing regularization consistency and generalization performance across different architectures. This approach was selected to mitigate overfitting and ensure stable convergence, as AdamW's decoupled weight decay avoids interference with adaptive learning rates, leading to more reliable optimization compared to standard Adam with L2 regularization. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function was employed to quantify prediction errors, as it provides a differentiable, scale-sensitive metric that penalizes large residuals proportionally, making it suitable for regression tasks involving continuous variables like friction angle and cohesion.\n$MSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$ (18)\nThe learning rate ($lr_{epoch}$) was dynamically adjusted using a StepLR scheduler (initial learning rate $Iro$=0.005, step size=300 epochs, decay factor $\\gamma$=0.8), which progressively reduces the learning rate to enable coarse exploration of the parameter space early in training and fine-tuned"}, {"title": "5. Ablation study", "content": "The ablation study presented in Table 1 evaluates the performance of various machine learning models in predicting friction angle and cohesion, using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as the primary evaluation metric. The results demonstrate that the proposed MLP model (MLP [64, 1000, 200, 8]) significantly outperforms both gradient-boosting algorithms (XGBoost and CatBoost) and alternative MLP configurations. Specifically, the proposed model achieved the lowest MAPE values for both friction angle (7.42%) and cohesion (14.96%), indicating superior predictive accuracy. The gradient-boosting algorithms showed comparable performance, with CatBoost achieving a slightly lower MAPE for cohesion (19.38%) compared to XGBoost (21.38%), likely due to its native handling of categorical features and ordered boosting mechanism. Among the MLP configurations, the deeper architecture (MLP [64, 5000, 1000, 200, 8]) underperformed for cohesion (20.19% MAPE), likely due to overfitting from excessive model complexity, while the smaller MLP (MLP [20, 200, 200, 8, 1]) achieved a lower MAPE for cohesion (15.24%) but higher friction angle MAPE (12.28%). The proposed MLP's optimized architecture balances model complexity and generalization, avoiding overfitting while effectively capturing the underlying patterns in the data. These findings highlight the importance of tailored model architecture in geotechnical predictive analytics, where accurate predictions of friction angle and cohesion are critical for applications such as slope stability analysis and foundation design in civil engineering. The proposed model's low MAPE values underscore its reliability and potential for practical implementation, reducing the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to gradient-boosting algorithms. Future work could explore further optimization techniques (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) or hybrid models combining the strengths of gradient-boosting and neural networks to enhance predictive performance."}, {"title": "6. Explainable Model", "content": "In this section, we employ SHAP (SHapley Additive explanations) [40] analysis to interpret the model's predictions by examining both global and local feature contributions. The global SHAP analysis provides an overview of how each feature influences the model's overall prediction performance. Specifically, it quantifies the average contribution of each feature across the entire dataset, enabling the identification of key features that drive the model's decision- making process. This global perspective is crucial for understanding the relative importance of features and their impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Local SHAP values, on the other hand, offer instance-specific explanations by detailing the contribution of each feature to individual predictions. This allows for a granular understanding of how specific feature values affect the model's output for particular data points. For example, in the context of friction angle and cohesion prediction, local SHAP values can highlight which features (e.g., soil type, particle size distribution) have the most significant impact on the predicted values for specific instances."}, {"title": "8. Discussion", "content": "The explainable AI framework developed for predicting MSW shear strength parameters demonstrates both promising capabilities and notable limitations that warrant discussion. Through 10-fold cross-validation, the model achieved consistent performance across different data subsets, with average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 5.1\u00b11.4 degrees for friction angle and 0.5\u00b10.3 kPa for cohesion, demonstrating robust generalization despite the limited dataset size. The narrow standard deviations in these metrics suggest stable predictive capabilities across different waste compositions. The model's superior performance compared to traditional gradient boosting approaches (XGBoost: 15.11% MAPE, CatBoost: 15.12% MAPE) for friction angle prediction, achieving 7.42% MAPE, validates the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning architecture.\nThe SHAP analysis revealed significant insights into feature importance, with food waste, plastics, and particle size fractions emerging as key determinants of friction angle prediction. This aligns with established geotechnical understanding, where these components significantly influence MSW mechanical behavior. Particularly noteworthy is the model's ability to capture the complex relationships between waste composition and shear strength parameters, as evidenced by the non-linear effects observed in the SHAP value distributions. The local interpretability provided by SHAP waterfall plots offers practical value for engineers, enabling detailed understanding of how specific waste compositions influence stability predictions.\nHowever, several limitations must be acknowledged. While the model achieves strong predictive performance, the relatively small dataset size (66 samples) from a single dumpsite location presents inherent limitations for model generalization. The current architecture, though effective for the available data, may not fully capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in waste degradation processes. This limitation is particularly relevant given that MSW properties evolve significantly over time through biochemical decomposition and physical settling processes.\nLooking forward, several promising research directions emerge from these limitations. The model architecture and pre-trained weights could serve as a foundation for transfer learning applications to other dumpsites, particularly those with similar waste composition profiles in Southeast Asia. This approach could help address the challenge of limited data availability at new sites while leveraging the knowledge gained from the current dataset. The development of larger, more diverse datasets incorporating samples from multiple landfills across different geographical regions would enhance model robustness and generalizability. Integration of temporal monitoring data could better capture degradation effects on shear strength parameters, while standardized waste characterization protocols would improve data consistency.\nFrom an architectural perspective, investigating hybrid models that combine CNN-LSTM networks could better capture spatial-temporal patterns in waste behavior. The implementation of multi-task learning approaches might enable simultaneous prediction of multiple mechanical properties, potentially improving overall model utility for practical applications. The experimental constraints of direct shear testing under specific normal stress conditions (10.00 to 20.00 kPa) and shallow burial depths (1.23 to 4.77 m) may not comprehensively represent the full range of conditions encountered in operational landfills."}, {"title": "9.

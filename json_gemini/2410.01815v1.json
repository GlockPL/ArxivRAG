Traditional advertising techniques are being complemented and, in some cases, replaced by artificial intelligence-driven strategies in food marketing. Marketing messages are being crafted, targeted, and delivered to consumers in a fundamentally different way as a result of this evolution. Artificial intelligence offers unprecedented capabilities for personalizing recommendations, predicting consumer behavior, and optimizing marketing efforts, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. Food marketing traditionally relied heavily on mass media channels such as television, radio, print, and outdoor advertising[1]. The traditional methods of building brand awareness and reaching a wide audience have proven effective. One-size-fits-all approaches, however, can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of personalized engagement with consumers. Marketers are now able to create targeted, relevant, and engaging marketing campaigns thanks to the emergence of digital media and the subsequent rise of artificial intelligence technology[2]. Customized recommendation systems are one of the most prominent applications of artificial intelligence in food marketing[3]To deliver highly tailored product recommendations, these systems use data from multiple sources, including purchase history, browsing behavior, and social media interactions. AI-driven recommendation systems can analyze individual preferences and predict future behaviors more accurately than traditional advertising techniques, which rely on demographic data[4]. Increased customer satisfaction, enhanced consumer experience, and higher conversion rates are the benefits of this level of personalization. AI is also making a significant impact on predictive analytics. Marketers can anticipate consumer needs and behaviors using predictive analytics by using historical data to forecast future outcomes[5]. Predictive analytics can be used to identify trends in food marketing, optimize inventory management, and design more effective marketing campaigns. An Al algorithm can, for instance, predict which products will be popular at different points of the year based on seasonal trends, market demand, and consumer preferences. Marketers can use this information to tailor their campaigns accordingly, ensuring the right products are promoted at the right time to the right audiences. Additionally, AI-driven strategies offer substantial benefits when it comes to efficiency and cost-effectiveness[6]. To plan, execute, and monitor traditional advertising campaigns, significant time and resources are often required. Artificial intelligence-powered tools, on the other hand, can automate many of these processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and allowing marketers to focus on strategic decisions. An example of this is the use of artificial intelligence algorithms in programmatic advertising platforms, which allow advertisers to automate the purchase and placement of ads in real-time based on consumer behavior and engagement metrics[7]. Automation not only streamlines the advertising process but also maximizes return on investment by allocating marketing budgets to the most effective channels and audiences[8]. AI has also been integrated into food marketing to enable more dynamic and responsive consumer engagement. In traditional advertising techniques, schedules and content are fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to consumer preferences and market conditions as they change[9]. AI-driven strategies, on the other hand, can continuously learn from consumer interactions and adjust marketing messages as needed. Marketers can take advantage of this adaptability to respond to emerging trends, hear from consumers, and refine their campaigns in order to achieve better results. A chatbot powered by artificial intelligence can engage with consumers on social media platforms, offering personalized recommendations, answering queries, and collecting valuable insights that can be used to improve future marketing campaigns[10]. Marketers can access large volumes of consumer data using AI technologies to gain deeper insights into their behavior. It can be difficult to identify the nuances of individual consumer preferences when traditional advertising techniques rely on aggregated data and broad market research[11]. AI-driven analytics, on the other hand, can analyze granular data from multiple sources and reveal patterns and correlations that would otherwise be difficult to spot. Marketers can use these insights to create more accurate customer profiles, segment their audiences more effectively, and design highly targeted campaigns using these insights. AI-driven strategies present numerous advantages, but they also present certain challenges and ethical considerations. The privacy and security of data are among the primary concerns[3]. Food marketing relies heavily on access to large amounts of consumer data, raising questions about how this information is collected, stored, and used. Developing consumer trust requires marketers to comply with data protection regulations and adopt transparent practices[12]. The sheer volume of targeted marketing messages could also lead to over personalization with AI-driven strategies. In order to maintain consumer trust and engagement, a balance must be struck between personalization and privacy. The implementation of AI in food marketing also requires significant investments in technology and expertise[13]. Cost savings and improved efficiency can be achieved with AI-driven strategies, but the initial setup costs can be high. For marketers to stay on top of AI advancements, they must invest in advanced analytics tools, hire skilled data scientists, and update their technology frequently. A necessity for ongoing training and education is also necessitated by the complexity of AI algorithms. AI is transforming how brands connect with consumers through food marketing. Compared to traditional advertising methods, AI-driven strategies provide an unprecedented ability to personalize recommendations, predict consumer behavior, and optimize marketing"}, {"title": "2. Literature review", "content": "Food marketing has been significantly transformed by artificial intelligence (AI). A new generation of AI-driven marketing strategies offers unprecedented levels of personalization and predictive accuracy, replacing traditional advertising techniques. In this literature review, we examine how AI can enhance personalized recommendations and predictive analytics in food marketing. In this review, traditional advertising techniques are compared with AI-driven strategies in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of integrating AI into food marketing. Key studies in this field examine the use of generative AI for creating realistic marketing texts[16], the impact of AI on consumer behavior in the pet food market[5], and the implications of AI-generated food images on consumer perception[6]. This comparative analysis highlights AI's potential for improving marketing effectiveness, consumer engagement, and market dynamics. Camelo et al. [17]examined how sustainable development is integrated within Portugal's agri-food sector, emphasizing the importance of promoting sustainable practices among businesses by integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Based on qualitative analysis and comprehensive interviews with managers and experts, this study revealed a disparity between SMEs and larger companies in terms of the maturity of sustainability practices. As a result of a limited budget and external pressures, SMEs often take a reactive approach to sustainability, while larger companies tend to take a proactive approach to sustainability. Sustainability practices must be embedded into organizational culture and strategy, according to the study. Hamdy et al. [18] reported that tourists' experiences influence the indirect relationships between extrinsic motivations, intrinsic motivations, and perceived destination images. This study used structural equation modeling with data from 613 international tourists of various nationalities to test five hypotheses. The findings indicated that second-order destinations' extrinsic motivations directly impacted tourists' intrinsic motivations and perceived destination image. Additionally, tourists' experiences moderated the direct effect of DEM on PDI for first-time visitors compared to repeat visitors and enhanced the direct effect of TIM on PDI. Kuang et al. [16] examined the challenges and practicality of using Natural Language Generation (NLG) to generate marketing messages in the Food and Beverage (F&B) industry. The study evaluated the effectiveness of existing techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT), for creating realistic marketing texts. Califano et al. [6]found that consumers could distinguish between AI-generated images of food and authentic images when the information was disclosed. Participants found AI-generated images easy to recognize, particularly those of ultra-processed foods. When AI-generated images were not disclosed, they were less appealing than authentic ones, but when identified as artificial, their appeal nearly equaled that of authentic pictures. Dalgic et al. [19]conducted a conceptual study to identify technologies that could mitigate the shortage of human resources at events and determine areas where these technologies might be useful. The study concluded that robots/robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and augmented reality/virtual reality could replace human resources in events due to shortages. Jayanthi & Shanthi [20]reviewed the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting crop yields. The systematic literature review identified common methods and features used in crop yield prediction studies. The review found that climate variables such as temperature, humidity, wind velocity, rainfall, sunlight hours, water level, and soil moisture were frequently used in crop yield predictions. Furthermore, deep learning algorithms outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms. Upendra et al. [21] investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on agriculture and food production in India, noting that the lockdown significantly affected these sectors. During the initial phase of the lockdown, Rabi crops were in the harvesting stage, leading to supply chain disruptions and reduced marketability. The study underscores the importance of understanding the impacts of global pandemics on agriculture and food production. Liu et al. [5]examined consumer behavior in the pet food market, focusing on factors influencing online and offline purchases. A comprehensive survey of pet owners and potential consumers analyzed the impact of price, logistics, service, and quality on decision-making. The findings indicated that price sensitivity significantly influenced consumer choices, with competitive pricing driving online purchases as consumers sought cost-effective options. Dulhare et al. [22] examined the use of AI and UAVs in rice cultivation, from plowing to harvesting. The study aimed to predict soil fertility and detect diseases, pests, and weeds early to increase yields. Manual detection methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this, AI algorithms were used to classify images of soil fertility using UAVs. The focus was on automating rice cultivation to reduce pesticide use and improve efficiency. Li et al.[23] introduced D-AdFeed, a location-based advertising framework that considers diversity when assigning ads to users. Existing systems often send users ads with the highest utility scores without considering category diversity, leading to repetitive and uninteresting advertisements. D-AdFeed addresses this by balancing ad utility with user satisfaction using a diversity-aware component. Ssematimba et al. [24] examined the geographic location and pathways of influenza A virus infection on commercial upland game bird farms in the United States. The study aimed to provide evidence supporting new strategies to minimize avian influenza outbreaks. The findings highlighted specific pathways for upland game bird farms, differing from those targeting poultry farms producing chickens, turkeys, and eggs, emphasizing the need for tailored control measures to effectively minimize AI outbreaks. Wetherill et al. [10] investigated food choice considerations"}, {"title": "3.

In several systematic reviews it has been shown that unhealthy food and brand marketing, especially in video games and on television, adversely affects children's health and diet quality. Marketing has traditionally involved one-way communication of information during certain times and places (e.g., television commercials). However, digital media\u2014including overt and covert (eg, product placement, social media influencers) promotional activities on websites, social media, text messaging, applications, email, and online games-allows marketers to push unprecedented volumes of information to children in real time, often using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tactics.4,5 In the digital age, commercial messages no longer interrupt, but are instead intimately integrated with content,6 and thus cues that can help children identify marketing (eg, commercial breaks) are absent or not prominently displayed."}, {"title": "7.

Indicators of the broader economic environment and consumer behavior can provide marketers with useful insights [43]. During economic expansions and contractions, these indicators impact advertising budgets and resource allocation, allowing for adjustments based on inflation rates and economic stability. Through adjustments to digital marketing strategies, agroeconomic indicators can be observed and predicted. Agroeconomic indicators provide marketers with insights into consumer behavior, helping them to ensure messages are delivered effectively to a specific demographic [47]. As pricing strategies are adjusted in response to economic indicators, marketing campaigns are more agile, aligning with prevailing economic conditions [48]. Agricultural companies can influence their financial performance and decision-making processes through digital marketing strategies. Agroeconomic index variations could potentially be analyzed using these strategies. In addition to leveraging economic fluctuations strategically to optimize outcomes, marketers benefit from insights from economic indices in crafting strategies that withstand and withstand economic fluctuations. The influence of agroeconomic conditions extends seamlessly into digital marketing, significantly affecting consumer behavior and shaping strategic initiatives online [49]. Particularly during economic downturns, marketers adopt a strategic approach to website optimization, emphasizing elements such as pricing transparency, tangible discounts, and value propositions designed to resonate with the cost-conscious sentiments of consumers [50]. This careful optimization aims not only to enhance the user experience but also to align the online presence of brands with the economic realities faced by consumers.

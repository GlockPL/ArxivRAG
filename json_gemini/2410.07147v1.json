HullTS", "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil"], "abstract": "Mental-health therapy involves a complex conversation flow in which patients and therapists continuously negotiate what should be talked about next. For example, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the therapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the discussion towards issues they want to focus on. How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and quality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a probabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately redirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and the actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to characterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple sessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis reveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally increases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses; and (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are significantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their therapist and terminate the relationship.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Mental-health therapy conversations are remarkably and consequentially complex. They involve an ongoing negotiation between a patient and a therapist regarding what should be talked about, how it should be talked about, and by whom. Conversational bids to shift the direction of the discussion (henceforth redirections) are a common and essential aspect of any therapeutic relationship. However, we lack an understanding of how these dynamics play out throughout the course of the therapeutic relationship and how they might relate to its quality."}, {"title": "2 Therapy Setting", "content": "Long-term text-based therapy. We develop our methodology in the context of Talkspace, a telehealth therapy platform. Patients can choose between different plans, which may include video therapy alongside messaging therapy. After a consultation in which they answer a few questions about their symptoms and describe their preferences, patients are matched by the platform to a suitable therapist who is licensed in their state. In this work, we use the (English-language) text-based conversations (after redaction of personally identifiable information by Talkspace) from a five-year span. During this time, Talkspace hosted over 18,000 licensed therapists providing services to over 300,000 patients. In total, over 65 million messages were exchanged. Therapies can be sustained over long periods of time, with more than 26,000 therapies lasting over a year and 17,000 therapies comprising over 500 messages. This setting thus provides an opportunity to study the long-term conversational dynamics as the therapeutic relationship develops. At any point, patients can either cancel their therapy or switch to a different therapist. When doing so, they are asked to provide a reason, either by selecting from a drop-down menu (e.g., \u201cThe treatment provided by my therapist was not helpful,\u201d \u201cI met my goal / I feel better\u201d) or by entering free text. We have some assurance that these reasons are authentic because patients are informed that therapists cannot access them. These reasons serve as imperfect indicators of the perceived quality of the therapeutic relation (for a broader discussion of difficulties in operationalizing the quality of the therapeutic relationship, see Section 8). Session identification. One challenge in studying the development of therapeutic relationships in this text-based setting is accounting for the wide variety of durations, tempos, and volubility exhibited in different therapies. A longitudinal analysis requires a methodology that captures the progression of the therapeutic process while allowing for meaningful aggregation across therapies with these vastly different interaction patterns. To address this challenge, we need to account for several factors. First, each therapist-patient pair develops a unique interaction style and tempo, including frequency of interaction, response time, and how often turns are split into multiple messages. Second, exchanges between a therapist and a patient include not only therapeutic conversation, but also short check-ins that deal with brief updates, scheduling, or survey completions. Last, an important component of many therapies is the occurrence of spans of approximately synchronous conversations, or sessions, over the therapy\u2019s duration. These three factors render conventional units of progression in conversational analysis\u2014such as time or number of utterances-unsuited for this complex interactional setting. Explicit session boundaries are lacking in text-based conversations and so must be inferred. We start by distinguishing high-activity periods interwoven with periods of little or no activity, using the method from Kushner and Sharma (2020) to capture these bursts. For each therapy, we define session-split points as moments when an utterance\u2019s reply time exceeds N\u00d7 (median reply time of that entire therapy). We further ensure that each session represents an actual conversation between the patient and the therapist (as opposed to, for example, a short notification and acknowledgement regarding scheduling) by filtering out short exchanges-any burst of activity with fewer than four turns (so that what remains includes at least two nonconsecutive utterances from each speaker) or includes a video session. We further remove any automated messages related to video sessions, survey completion, or scheduling. To validate the quality of the session splits, we sampled therapies with at least 10 sessions and ran a Bayesian distinguishing-word analysis (Monroe et al., 2017) on the first and last utterance of each session. The distinguishing words are intuitive: sessions start with greetings (\"hi\", \"morning\", \"hey\", \"how\") and end with a farewell or expression of gratitude (\"enjoy\", \"welcome\", \"thank\", \"thanks\")."}, {"title": "3 Redirection Measure", "content": "3.1 What redirection is (not)\nWe aim to quantify the redirection effect of a given utterance in a conversation: the extent to which it alters the immediate focus of the conversation. We start from the realization that for an utterance to have a high redirection effect, it must (a) attempt to put the conversation on a different course (intention of redirection), and (b) receive a reply that is compliant with this redirection (realization of redirection). We will examine previous methods that capture these two conditions separately and explore how they guide us toward a design for a measure that jointly accounts for both of them. For concreteness, we employ the convention (and notation) from Figure 1 of centering the discussion on a therapist\u2019s utterance Tk; but the analogous definitions apply to a patient\u2019s utterance Ck.\nOrientation. Orientation (Zhang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2020) captures the degree to which an utterance intends to move the conversation away from what was already discussed. A \"forwards-oriented\" utterance (high orientation) is one that intends to advance the conversation towards a specific target, and thus is expected to be followed by a reply centered on that target. A \"backwards-oriented\" utterance (low orientation) is one that intends to address what was previously said, and thus is expected to follow a specific utterance. Thus, orientation characterizes an utterance\u2019s intended objective, regardless of whether that intention is realized or not. In Figure 1 (top), Tk is a high-orientation utterance since the therapist intends to redirect the conversation by asking the patient about a specific source of stress at work. This remains true regardless of whether the patient conforms in Ck+1 by aligning themselves with the newly suggested direction (by introducing their frustration with gossip; left branch), or resists the redirection attempt (by maintaining the focus on their general state of stress, rather than delving into specifics; right branch).\nSimilarity difference. To incorporate the actual reply, one may simply compute the similarity of the reply Ck+1 with the original utterance Tk and compare it against a reference point to account for the ongoing direction of the conversation. A potential reference point is the extreme scenario when the therapist wishes to ensure no redirection will take place by simply repeating their previous utterance Tk-1. In other words, the redirection of utterance Tk could be formalized as the difference between the similarity of Ck+1 and Tk and that of Ck+1 and Tk-1.\nUnlike orientation, this measure considers the actual reply; but it hinges on the assumption that semantic similarity can sufficiently capture the redirection realization. Successful redirection, however, is not synonymous with similarity between utterance and reply. Two examples in Figure 1 (top, left vs. right branch) illustrate this: while they intuitively show different levels of redirection, in both cases the similarity difference is high.\nUptake. For a more nuanced take on redirection realization that goes beyond similarity, we could aim to measure the reply's \"uptake\u201d: how much it answers, acknowledges, or builds upon the previous utterance. Demszky et al. (2021) formalize this concept (in the context of student-teacher interactions) as the dependence of the reply on the utterance via point-wise Jensen-Shannon divergence, which uses next-sentence prediction to quantify the extent to which a given reply is a probable response. While capturing redirection realization better than similarity, uptake does not account for the redirection intent. For instance, two examples in Figure 1 (top left branch vs. bottom) have high uptake, with the patient replies being consistent with the respective therapist's utterance. They, however, show different levels of redirection, as only in the first example does the therapist intentionally shift the focus of conversation.\nOur approach: Redirection. We combine the insights of these existing measures to develop a new redirection measure that captures both the intention and realization components. In particular, our analysis of the previous measures points toward the need to consider the actual reply the utterance receives, to use a predictive component to capture the extent to which the reply naturally follows the utterance, and to use a point of reference to capture a change in direction. More concretely, to quantify the redirecting effect of an utterance, we first consider the likelihood of the patient\u2019s reply given the previous context:\n$P_k(C_{k+1}) = P(C_{k+1} | C_k, T_k)$.\nWe condition on the most recent utterances from both speakers, Ck and Tk, to capture both of their prior conversational context. We use as point of reference the extreme scenario wherein the therapist simply repeats their previous utterance Tk\u22121 as Tk, demonstrating absolutely zero intent to redirect: \n$Q_k(C_{k+1}) = P(C_{k+1} | C_k, T_{k-1})$.\nWe then formally define the redirection of Tk as the log-odds ratio of these two probabilities: \n$R(T_k) = \\log \\left(\\frac{P_k(C_{k+1})}{1-P_k(C_{k+1})} \\frac{1-Q_k(C_{k+1})}{Q_k(C_{k+1})} \\right)$ (1)\nWhen redirection is high, Pk(Ck+1) \u226b Qk(Ck+1), Tk alters the direction of the conversation, in the sense that the patient's reply Ck+1 is likely as a reply to this utterance, but not as a continuation of the previous direction of the conversation. Conversely, in cases of low redirection, the patient's response is less affected by the therapist's utterance. We compute the redirection of a patient's utterance in the corresponding way. Operationalization. To compute the probabilities for our redirection measure, we fine-tuned the Gemma-2B model (Mesnard et al., 2024) with 4-bit QLORA (Dettmers et al., 2023) using a held-out dataset of 8,000 therapy conversations."}, {"title": "3.2 Session-level aggregation", "content": "To apply and compare our utterance-level measures across therapy sessions, we use two aggregation methods. The first method averages the utterance-level measures per session for each speaker. A speaker\u2019s average redirection in a session is computed as the mean redirection of their utterances in that session, which we denote with Tavg and Cavg for the therapist and patient respectively. The second method examines the balance of redirection between speakers to determine who is redirecting the conversation more in a given session. Analyzing the balance of redirection can reveal how the control of the discussion is shared between the patient and therapist. Equation 2 formalizes relative redirection from the therapist's perspective: \n$T_{rel} = \\frac{exp(T_{avg})}{exp(T_{avg}) + exp(C_{avg})}$ (2)\nThe relative value for the patient Crel is computed the corresponding fashion. Note that mathematically, Trel + Crel = 1."}, {"title": "4 Redirection in Online Therapy", "content": "We employ our formalism to study redirection in online text-based therapies. We first validate that our redirection measure corresponds to human intuition in the therapy setting. We then explore how redirection relates to the development of the therapeutic relationship. We move on to study the relation between redirection and the patient\u2019s perception of the quality of the therapy. Finally, we apply the related measures discussed in Section 3 to gain additional insight into which interactional dynamics might account for the observed trends."}, {"title": "4.1 Validation studies", "content": "Human validation. To check how aligned our measure is with our intuitive understanding of redirection in this particular online therapy setting, we designed a redirection identification experiment. A participant is shown a pair of two short interactions, each consisting of 4 utterances (like the examples in Figure 1). Their task is to pick which one of them has a higher redirection effect in the second to last utterance (e.g., Tk in Figure 1). Each pair for this experiment is constructed by first picking a random therapy, selecting the utterance with the highest and lowest redirection effect according to our measure, and considering the interaction surrounding those utterances. We select 10 such pairs using our redirection measure, and for comparison, we select 10 more pairs for each of the other measures discussed in Section 3. If a measure properly captures the redirection effect, we expect it to match the human rankings. To respect the privacy of the data and adhere to IRB protocol, the task was performed by one of the authors who was authorized to read the therapy text. To avoid author bias, we administered the task in a blind fashion, with the participant not knowing which pairs were selected using which measure. The participant ranking perfectly matched that of our redirection measure, compared to 8 out of 10 matches for the similarity difference, 5 out of 10 for orientation, and 4 out of 10 for uptake. While limited in scale due to the privacy restrictions on the data, these results suggest that our measure does indeed capture an intuitive notion of redirection which the other measures do not. The experiment also inspired a qualitative analysis comparing examples in which the metrics disagree (Section 5). Shuffle check. Given that redirection is inherently an aspect of conversation flow, any proposed measure of it should be sensitive to utterance order. To check for this intuitive property, we can shuffle a session\u2019s utterances: we would expect no redirection to occur in this shuffled setting. Indeed, while the average redirection across all (non-shuffled) sessions is 6.40, in the shuffled case it is near zero (-0.025; p < 0.0001 for the difference, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In our main analysis below, we use the shuffle check to ensure that the trends we observe are actually related to conversational processes, as opposed to spurious non-conversational phenomena such as changes in session or utterance length."}, {"title": "4.2 Evolution of the therapeutic relationship", "content": "We now present our main analysis: connecting redirection to the development and quality of the therapeutic relationship. We start with examining the change in redirection as the therapist-patient relation develops, focusing on sustained therapies having at least 10 sessions (3, 764 in total). Figure 2 shows the average redirection measure Tavg and Cavg in each session for the first 5 and last 5 sessions. For both the patient and therapist, there is a downward trend in local redirection as therapy progresses (p < 0.0001 according to a Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing the first and last 5 sessions). Thus, as the therapy progresses, redirection in conversation occurs less from both speakers, perhaps suggesting a smoother flow of the conversation with more stable conversational goals (see Section 5 for a qualitative analysis). We now switch from considering each speaker\u2019s redirection separately to examining how the balance between the two evolves over time. Figure 3 shows the patient\u2019s relative redirection Crel across the first 5 vs. last 5 sessions. As the relationship progresses, the patient share of redirects increases (p<0.0001), suggesting that the patients gain more relative control over the flow of the conversation. We re-analyze the trends after shuffling the utterances within a session. After the shuffle, all observed trends in the original data disappear (no statistical difference), suggesting that they are indeed tied to the conversation dynamics."}, {"title": "4.3 Unsuccessful relationships", "content": "We now investigate how redirection is related to the quality of the therapeutic relationship. For this purpose, we consider a therapeutic relation to be \"unsuccessful\" if the patient eventually abandons it via a request to switch therapists or to cancel the subscription and provides a reason that explicitly cites dissatisfaction with the therapist or with the relation (see Appendix A.3 for a list of such reasons). After filtering out therapies that had fewer than 3 sessions (to ensure that the patient actually \"gave it a try\"), we are left with 817 such unsuccessful relations. For a meaningful comparison, we consider a control group with the same number of therapies where the patient did not request to cancel or switch the therapist, and that also has at least 3 sessions. To discard effects due to the duration of the therapy and focus on signals that could be perceived early in the therapeutic process, we only consider the first 3 sessions in this analysis. Table 1 shows that in unsuccessful relationships, patients redirect the conversations less than in the control group (p = 0.018; Mann-Whitney U test), while we do not find any difference for therapists (p = 0.5). We note these differences disappear after shuffling the order of the utterances in the session (p = 0.17), thus they reflect differences tied to conversation dynamics."}, {"title": "4.4 Comparison to other measures", "content": "We also explore how our redirection measure compares to the other related measures discussed in Section 3. The results are summarized in Table 2. It is worth noting that none of the related measures show a significant difference between the \u201cunsuccessful\" therapies and the control group, and only the similarity difference measure exhibits temporal trends that pass the shuffling test. We highlight here the results for orientation, since by capturing the redirection intent separately, they provide further context for interpreting the results discussed above. Orientation shows a significant downward trend for therapists; thus the observed decrease in redirection can be at least partially attributed to the decrease in their attempts to change the course of the conversation (rather than to the patient\u2019s unwillingness to realize those attempts). Furthermore, there is no difference in patient orientation between the \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and control groups (p = 0.5), suggesting that reduced patient redirection is not due to lack of patient redirection bids, but rather because the therapist is not accepting those bids."}, {"title": "5 Qualitative Analysis", "content": "We conduct a qualitative analysis of high- and low-redirection examples to explore therapy strategies that are tied to this phenomenon and to further interpret the observed trends. Additionally, we analyze examples where the redirection measure deviates from the related measures to check our intuition about differences in what they capture. The discussion follows examples from Table 3. Redirection strategies. In our setting, highly redirecting therapist utterances typically involve exploration and surveying. Therapists tend to use open-ended questions to assess their patients' given situations and viewpoints (Example 1: \"Where does this [issue] originate from\"). They may also suggest different perspectives or provide guidance on addressing these issues (Example 2: \"Try sitting with your feelings ...\"). Conversely, less-redirecting utterances tend to echo or validate the patient's statements or empathize with their struggles. They may also reformulate what the patient has said and keep the focus on the immediate problem at hand (Example 4: \"Sounds awful. Is it...\"). For patients, highly redirecting utterances tend to introduce personal experiences or feelings that shape the immediate course of the conversation. They may initiate subjects they wish to explore or verbalize the specific obstacles they are facing (Example 6: Challenges at work). Low-redirecting patient utterances, on the other hand, extend the current subject of discussion. These observations are consistent with the decreasing trend in redirection for both speakers. Initially, patients and therapists both focus on introducing the context of the therapy and setting therapeutic goals. Therapists tend to actively discuss the objectives of the therapy and suggest behavioral strategies and cognitive techniques. Patients, likewise, will share their background or expectations as they start out their therapeutic relationship. Later sessions, conversely, usually consist of more concentrated discussions on the identified issues. Comparison with other metrics. We also examined cases where the redirection measure is at odds with the related measures. As expected, orientation can be high even when redirection is resisted. For instance, in Example 3, the therapist attempts to steer the conversation towards discussing who to talk to, but the patient disregards their suggestions and continues explaining their plans, thus causing redirection to be low. Importantly, unlike similarity difference, our metric captures utterances with redirection effects even when the reply is not semantically similar. In Example 2, the therapist redirects the focus of the conversation by suggesting a potential solution to the patient's problem, which the patient acknowledges in their reply. While similarity difference is low since acknowledging the suggestion is not semantically similar, the patient does reflect on the therapist's suggestion, which deviates from their prior discussion focused on the problem. Our measure also differs from uptake in that it uses a reference point: the previous conversational context. Example 7 illustrates a segment where the patient reflects on having someone to vent to. The therapist addresses the patient's utterance by continuing to encourage the patient to vent, exhibiting high uptake. However, the focus of the conversation does not change, indicating low redirection."}, {"title": "6 Further Related Work", "content": "Our work relates to prior research on conversational dynamics, analyzing the development and quality of therapeutic relationships, and exploring language on mental-health platforms. Development and quality of therapeutic relationships. The development of the patient-therapist relationship and its impact on therapy outcomes have been extensively studied (Gelso and Carter, 1985; Norcross, 2010). Previous work characterized therapeutic alliance (Goldberg et al., 2020) and ruptures (Tsakalidis et al., 2021) through emotional engagement (Christian et al., 2021), sentiment (Syzdek, 2020), linguistic coordination (Nasir et al., 2019), and synchrony (Dor\u00e9 and Morris, 2018). Our work characterizes an additional dimension of the patient-therapist relationship based on the joint act of redirection. Conversational dynamics. Prior computational work examined different aspects of conversation flow (Zhang et al., 2016), including work on topic segmentation (Eisenstein and Barzilay, 2008; Nguyen et al., 2014; Purver, 2011; Glavas and Somasundaran, 2020; Jiang et al., 2023) and topic shift (Xie et al., 2021). While these conversation-level concepts are related, our probabilistic measure seeks to quantify the immediate effect of a single utterance, an effect different from semantic similarity and topic coherence. Furthermore, we develop a framework for a longitudinal analysis of conversational dynamics in the distinctive domain of online mental-health therapy. Online mental-health platforms. Prior literature extensively explores linguistic behaviors and conversational choices users make in online mental-health-related platforms, whether in crisis counseling platforms (Althoff et al., 2016; Zhang and Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, 2020), peer-support platforms (Yang et al., 2017; Pruksachatkun et al., 2019; Yang and Jurgens, 2024), or therapy platforms (Malgaroli et al., 2023b). Accompanying growing attention to online mental-health resources and use of technology in psychotherapy (Anthony, 2003; Barak et al., 2008), many studies highlighted the benefits of online social support (De Choudhury and K\u0131c\u0131man, 2017; Newman et al., 2011). We specifically focus on long-term sustained relationships in text-based therapy platforms, offering a novel perspective on development of the patient-therapy relation through longitudinal analyses."}, {"title": "7 Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "Redirection is a joint act often performed by therapists and patients. Its realization requires both speakers to understand the initial direction of the conversation, one's attempt to redirect it, and the other's compliance with this attempt. As such, its study has the potential to characterize the patient-therapist dyad, in particular with respect to their ability to negotiate the focus of the conversation. In this work, we introduce a computational method for quantifying the redirection effect of an utterance and apply it to a mental-health-therapy domain. We find that both the patient and the therapist redirect less as therapy progresses. Our qualitative analysis suggests that after initial exploration and contextualization prompted by both speakers, the relationship matures to a more stable stage with less redirection. Moreover, we reveal that the less patients redirect early on, the more likely they are to eventually express dissatisfaction with the therapist and abandon the relationship. Connection with psychotherapy literature. Several decades of research in psychotherapy suggest that the \"treatment model\" approach in which an expert clinician provides curative treatment that the patient passively receives is not well supported by outcomes or engagement data (Bohart, 2000; Duncan and Miller, 2000). Instead, shifting focus from which aspects of treatment are delivered to how dyads collaboratively negotiate therapeutic conversations has provided evidence of improved access, efficiency, and effectiveness of mental-health services for \"patient-led\" approaches (Carey, 2010; Carey et al., 2013; Huber et al., 2021). Our results offer a computational perspective into one dimension of patient agency in therapeutic relationships. Future work. A computational approach to redirection enables us to observe the evolution of therapeutic relationships and could assist therapists in fostering them. A complementary line of work can include a more in-depth exploration of how to foster healthy levels of redirection in therapy and the causal relationship between redirection and the quality of therapeutic relationships. For instance, labeling messages with therapeutic strategies and techniques can provide insight into the effectiveness of each strategy and determine which ones are more applicable for specific contexts (e.g., when patients resist therapists' redirection attempts). In their current observational form, these results suggest that early conversational patterns can signal the eventual dissatisfaction of the patient. Future work could examine the predictive power of these ties and test the extent to which they might be explained by other (unalterable) factors, such as the characteristics of the patient or of their condition. Our methodology can extend beyond the mental-health domain and be applied to other conversation-rich domains, such as education, online discussions, or interviews, where discussions are carried out in relatively unstructured ways with only a few general agendas set. Exploration of redirection in these contexts may present a unique perspective into how speakers are able to redirect and control the flow of the discussions. Finally, understanding how humans redirect the flow of conversations is important for supporting more naturalistic human-AI conversations, where the AI could pick up on humans' redirection attempts and initiate their own."}, {"title": "8 Limitations", "content": "In the mental-health context, how to define successful therapeutic relations is always an open question. Our work uses patient-provided reasons for canceling the therapy or switching therapists that explicitly mention dissatisfaction with the therapist as an imperfect indicator for failure of the therapeutic relationship. A reliable positive signal, on the other hand, is difficult to define, especially in a therapy domain where patients can have hidden agendas, present misleading information, or choose to remain in treatment for a number of reasons (Newman and Strauss, 2003). We thus do not consider the control group to necessarily contain \u201csuccessful\" relationships, and thus the interpretation of the results of the comparison should be interpreted accordingly. Furthermore, these results are purely observational, and future work would be needed to establish if intervening to change the amount of realized redirection (e.g., through therapist training) would have an effect on the quality of the therapeutic relationship. The notion of session we employed captures the structure of therapy that arises as patients and therapists maintain a long term relationship spanning multiple conversations, rather than just a single encounter. However, sessions' characteristics change as time progresses. We observed that the session length and the token count of utterances in sessions both decrease. While our shuffling experiments suggest that our observations are not merely a result of this variability and are tied to the actual dynamics of the conversation, further work is needed to fully account for this variability. Our work focuses on text-based conversations. While these are a substantial component of online therapy, they do not capture the occasional video conversations that patients and therapists might have. Future work could explore video conversations and the role they have in the development of relationships (although additional de-identification challenges arise when working with video data). As our redirection measures reflect change in the subject of the conversation, they require the reply of the utterance to be able to be calculated. This constraint can be restrictive in practice, as an automated system would be unable to analyze an ongoing conversation without a reply it hasn't received yet. Exploring how we can predict whether the upcoming reply will cooperate with one's attempt to redirect remains an interesting direction for future work. Ethical Concerns. As our work involves highly sensitive data in the form of patient chat-therapy history and surveys, all personally identifiable information was removed. Access to the data was strictly limited to the authors of the paper, and data was processed on restricted servers and will be removed upon publication. All large language models trained on the data were strictly internal and discarded after the analysis. This work is done in close collaboration with the therapy platform Talkspace. All participants consent to the use of their data in aggregate and de-identified format for research purposes as part of the Terms of Service they review during onboarding (in the case of the patients) or as part of information reviews done during the hiring process (in the case of the therapists). All individuals may opt out of the use of their data for research purposes at any time without penalty.

The power dynamics between these distinct roles reflect the asymmetric relationship between therapists and patients in mental-health domains, where one party generally holds more influence over the conversation. As expected, our analysis reveals that justices redirect the conversation significantly more than lawyers (p < 0.001, according to a Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Our findings suggest that justices exercise more control over the flow of the discussion, steering it towards issues they consider critical to the case. To further examine how redirection unfolds in these exchanges, we use a Bayesian distinguishing word analysis, \u201cFightin' Words\" (Monroe et al., 2017) to compare high and low redirection phrases from both speakers. For justices, highly redirecting utterances frequently involve assertive questioning (\"may ask\", \"ask you\", \"if he\", \"is this\") or references that draw the court's attention to specific matters (\"the court\", \"court of\"). In contrast, low redirecting utterances from justices tend to include responses (\"all right\", \"that right\", \"no no\") or clarifications (\"you mean\", \"mean that\") of subjects raised by other parties. Conversely, highly redirecting utterances by lawyers often direct the court's (\"the federal\", \"this court\", \"this state\") focus to new arguments or highlight their perspectives on the case (\"it seems\", \"to me\", \"that the\"). Low lawyer redirecting utterances, however, tend to affirm and acknowledge the justice's statements (\"yes sir\", \"your honor\", \"oh yes\") or continue discussing the current issue at hand (\"it was\", \"it for\")."}]}

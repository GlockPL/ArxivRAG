Introduction", "content": "Near-Earth asteroids are the diffused members of the Main Belt asteroid population that have escaped through\nvarious resonances found throughout the Main Belt (1; 2). A subset of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), Atira asteroids are\nfound on orbits with aphelia, 0.718 au < Q < 0.983 au, just outside the aphelion of Venus and inside the perihelion\ndistance of the Earth (3; 4). 'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim asteroids have aphelia Q < 0.718 au, inhabiting the orbital space inside\nthe perihelion of Venus. Hereafter, we use the abbreviation 'Aylo' for the 'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim class of asteroids. Models\ndescribing the population of NEAs predict that there are ~10,000 Atira asteroids and ~2,000 Aylo asteroids with\nabsolute magnitude 17 < H < 25 (~1500 m to ~40 m assuming an albedo of 0.12). (4). Searches for asteroids inside\nthe orbits of the Earth and Venus may provide tests of asteroid populations models. For example, the discovery of the\nfirst Aylo, 'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim(5; 6), may suggest that the observed population of Aylo objects in the inner-Solar system\nmay be larger than predicted by contemporary asteroid population models (6; 7). However, a thorough analysis of the\nAylo completeness and survey coverage is beyond the scope of this work and reserved for future study.\nThe observed orbital and physical properties of NEAs are strongly affected by observational selection effects such\nas limiting magnitude, sky coverage, and cadence (8). Differences in the properties of different NEA surveys can\nresult in some surveys being advantageous over others towards finding certain types of NEAs, i.e., surveys with fainter\nlimiting magnitudes finding more small objects, etc. (9). The observed orbital properties of NEAs also have a directional\ndependence, where the detection of asteroids becomes more probable at low ecliptic latitudes due to the low inclinations\nof many Main Belt asteroids between 2.0 and 3.5 au from the Sun (10). The detection of asteroids on higher inclinations\nmay require observation of parts of the sky significantly higher above the ecliptic, as for Kuiper Belt objects >30 au\nfrom the Sun with inclinations >10\u00b0 (11). NEAs may have a broad ecliptic latitude distribution due to their broader\ninclination distribution and <0.3 au proximity with the Earth (12). NEAs surveys may cover sky close to the ecliptic\nplane, resulting in more distant objects being detected as well as detecting objects passing closer to or in orbit around\nthe Earth in searches covering latitudes off of the ecliptic (13; 14; 4).\nThe angular distance between NEA survey pointings and the Sun also affects the orbital range of asteroids observed\nin the survey. For asteroids interior to the orbit of the Earth, the maximum angular distance between the Sun and an\nasteroid is given by arcsin(Q/1au) where Q is the aphelion of the asteroid. As regions of the sky with ecliptic longitudes\ncloser to the Sun are observed, the minimum Q of asteroids located in the sky that is detectable by the survey decreases\n(8). For asteroids with aphelia interior to the ~0.98 au perihelion of Earth, this angle is 90\u00b0, inside the ~0.718 au\nperihelion of Venus, 46\u00b0, inside the ~0.47 au aphelion of Mercury, ~27.8\u00b0 and inside the ~0.31 au perihelion of\nMercury, ~17.9\u00b0. For ground-based surveys, the small angular distance between asteroids interior to the orbit of the\nEarth and the Sun necessitates observations taking place within ~1 h of sunset or sunrise when sky within this angular\ndistance from the Sun is accessible within the elevation range of most survey telescopes (9).\nConcepts for ground-based surveys designed for the detection of NEAs interior to the orbit of the Earth were\ndemonstrated with the University of Hawaii 88-inch telescope (UH 88-inch) (15) resulting in the discovery of the\nfirst known interior-Earth asteroid, 1998 DK36 (16). Additionally, simulations of ground-based surveys showed that\nasteroids interior to the orbit of Venus could be observed during twilight (17). Searches for asteroids interor to the orbit\nof the Earth were conducted by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research project (LINEAR, which discovered the first\ninterior-Earth asteroid given a number and a name, (163693) Atira, 18; 19), Catalina Sky Survey (20), Pan-STARRS\n(21), the Isaac Newton Telescope (22; 23), the Palomar 48-inch/Zwicky Transient Facility (P48/ZTF) (e.g., 6; 7). These\nground based surveys covered the sky near or interior to quadrature allowing for the detection of inner-Earth asteroids"}, {"title": "2. ZTF Twilight Survey and Follow Up", "content": "2.1. ZTF Twilight Observations\nThe P48 telescope with its ZTF possesses a field of view of 47 sq. deg. and a 5-6 limiting magnitude of r~21 (32).\nThe P48 is primarily used to survey the entire observable night sky in two bands, g (mean wavelength ~483.0 nm)\nand r-band (mean wavelength ~646.8 nm), to detect transients such as supernovae, variable stars, and electromagnetic\ncomponents of gravitational wave phenomena (33). The ZTF camera consists of 16 separate 6144 pixel \u00d7 6160 pixel\nCharge-Coupled Device (CCD) arrays on a single camera mounted at the prime focus of the P48. The plate scale of\nthe camera is 1.01 arcseconds pixel\u00af\u00b9 has a square 7.4\u00b0 \u00d7 7.4\u00b0 dimensions with an 86.7% fill factor (34).\nImage data are processed with an image differencing pipeline using reference frames to remove static sources. Solar\nsystem transients are extracted from the images using the ZTF Moving Object Detection Engine (ZMODE) algorithm\nfor objects moving slower than ~2 (\u00b0/d) (35). A special version of ZMODE, called ZMODE Lite, was configured to\nrun on the twilight survey day on a per night, per session basis. The ZMODE Lite pipeline operates by linking pairs of\ndetections found on subsequent images moving at similar velocities. ZMODE Lite was tested on background Main Belt\nasteroids found in Twilight Survey fields and determined to have a detection efficiency has been shown to be \u226580%\nfor asteroids with r<19-20, and a 43% efficiency, half the maximum value of 87%, of r<20.5 as seen in Fig. 1F of\n(7) assuming a conversion of V-r of 0.2. This is a significant increase in efficiency compared to twilight observations\nby (24) in which only V~19.5 or brighter were detected with an efficiency of 36%, half their maximum efficiency of\n72%. The increase in efficiency of our survey compared to (24) is likely due to the increase in the sky coverage, and\na cadence and moving object detection and data processing techniques more beneficial to the detection of asteroids.\nAdditionally, (24) is quoted as using ZMODE for their identification of moving objects, however, a different moving\nobject detection algorithm was actually used instead of ZMODE (private communication).\nAdditionally, the Tails deep-learning neural network is used to identify comets on individual twilight survey images\n(36). We used a 32 CPU core virtual machine instance on Google Cloud computing resources which took ~5-10 h to\nprocess a night's worth of images. Algorithms for shift-and-stack detection of solar system transients (37; 38) as well\nas citizen science projects for the detection of comets (39) exist, but their application to the twilight survey is beyond\nthe scope of this manuscript.\nA small portion of the total P48/ZTF time is allocated to microsurveys for the detection of solar system objects\n(40; 41; 7). One of the microsurveys is designed to look at the sky with solar distance angles <60\u00b0 during nautical\nand astronomical twilight to detect comets and asteroids inside the orbit of Earth as well as Earth co-orbitals (6; 42).\nBetween September 2019 and 2022 Sep 29, twilight observations consisted of 5-10% of the total scheduled ZTF survey\ntime took place during 551 evening nautical twilight sessions and 601 morning nautical twilight sessions. The fraction"}, {"title": "2.2. Follow up observation details", "content": "The initial observations of asteroid and comet discovery candidates were reported to the Minor Planet Center\n(MPC) within several hours of the twilight survey sessions for ZMODE Lite asteroid candidates, and within 5-10 h\nfor Tails comet candidates. A minimum of three observations were reported to MPC. Additionally, announcement of\nthe discovery of candidates were also announced to the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen\nnetwork (GROWTH) (44). The GROWTH network was established to follow up supernova and gravitational wave\nevents but has been previously used to follow up solar system objects detected by ZTF for both characterization and\nastrometry (30; 45; 46; 47; 48). The few hours difference between the observations and the reporting of candidates to\nthe Minor Planet Center and GROWTH network and the ~10-20 minutes length of observational arc typical for twilight\nobservations resulted in our candidates having relatively small skyplane uncertainties of ~10 arcsec and growing by\n~1 arcmin per day\u00b9."}, {"title": "3. Results", "content": "In total, 1 Aylo, 3 Atiras, and 8 comets were discovered in the twilight survey between 2019 September and 2022\nSeptember. A list of the one Aylo, three Atiras, and eight comets and their orbital elements discovered during the ZTF\ntwilight survey is shown in Table 1, and their observational circumstances are listed in Table 2. Example discovery\nimages are shown in in Fig. 9 for 2021 PB2 and P/2022 P2. Cartesian representations of the orbits of the Aylo and\nAtira discoveries and comet discoveries are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. Additionally, the twilight survey serendipitously\nrecovered 1 Aylo, 12 Atiras, and 6 comets, including interstellar comet 2I/Borisov (30; 59). The comets were recovered\nusing the Tails neural network pipeline as described in previous sections. The list of Aylo, Atira, and comet recoveries\nis listed in Table 3, and their observational circumstances are listed in Table 4. In addition, 45,536 unique known\nMain Belt asteroids and 265 known unique near-Earth objects were recovered in the twilight survey. There were no\ndiscoveries of new Amors, Apollos, or Atens due to the bright limiting magnitude of the twilight survey, the relatively\ncompleteness of objects in these classes by other surveys, and observational selection effects that favor the detection\nof these objects at large solar elongation distances (8).\nThe Sun-centric ecliptic positions of twilight survey Aylo, Atira, and comet discoveries and recoveries are shown\nin Fig. 2. Overall, the morning portion of the twilight survey resulted in more discoveries where only (594913)\n'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim was discovered in the evening twilight survey. This may be due to the greater ease of recovering objects in\nthe morning twilight sky since more time is available to recover objects before they go into solar conjunction compared\nto the evening twilight sky (30). More recoveries occurred in the evening twilight sky compared to discoveries (7\nrecoveries vs 1 discovery). However, the morning twilight survey resulted in more discoveries compared to recoveries\n(12 discoveries vs. 11 recoveries).\nThe Sun-centric angular distance and magnitude of the twilight survey Aylo, Atira, and comet discoveries and\nrecoveries are shown in Fig. 3. The smallest Sun-centric angular distance Aylo observation was taken of (594913)\n'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim at 39.5\u00b0 from the Sun during evening twilight on 2020 Jan 4, and the smallest Sun-centric angular\ndistance Atira observation was taken at 32.7\u00b0 from the Sun during evening twilight for the recovery of (413563) on\n2021 Feb 07. The smallest Sun-centric angular distance comet observation was made to discover P/2022 P2 on 2022\nAug 15 during morning twilight. As seen in the bottom right panel of Fig. 3, twilight survey asteroid and comet\ndiscoveries occurred between an r magnitude of ~17.2 to ~20.7.\nFigs. 4-6 show the time after/before sunset, altitude of the Sun, and the Sun-centric angular distance of the twilight\nsurvey Aylo, Atira, and comet discoveries and recoveries plotted versus limiting magnitude. In general, fainter objects\nwere found further from the Sun/longer before or after the Sun set or rose. The Aylo, Atiras, and comets were found\n0.5-1 magnitudes brighter than the limiting magnitude of the images they were found in. Fig. 7 and 8 show the day of\nthe year versus the Sun-centric angular distance twilight survey when Aylo, Atira, and comet discoveries and recoveries\nwere made. In general, evening twilight survey discoveries and recoveries favor the first half of the year (top left panels\nof Figs. 7 and 8) whereas Aylo, Atira, and comet discoveries and recoveries are more evening distributed through the\nyear for the morning portion (top right and bottom panels of Figs. 7 and 8).\nThe NEOMOD NEO model (4) was used to generate the semi-major axis, a, eccentricity, e, inclination, i, aphelion,\nQ, and absolute magnitude, H, distributions of the Aylo and Atira populations as shown in Fig. 12. The orbital elements\nand H of Aylo and Atira discoveries and recoveries made by the twilight survey are overplotted. The range covered\nby twilight survey Aylo and Atira discoveries and recoveries is between ~0.5 au and ~0.8 au, the e range is between\n~0.15 and ~0.5 with the Q ranging between ~0.65 au and 0.95 au. The i range is between 15 and 50\u00b0, missing some of\nthe lower i Atiras in the population owing to the higher ecliptic latitude coverage of the twilight survey (8). The albedo\nmodel (60) was used with orbital elements of the Aylo and Atira asteroids observed in the twilight survey to estimate\ntheir albedos and are listed in Tables 1 and 3. Note the mismatch in the albedo estimated for (163913) and the albedo\ninferred by radar diameter measurements (61)."}, {"title": "4. Discussion and conclusion", "content": "The Palomar twilight survey, between 2019 September and 2022 September, demonstrated the capabilities for\ndiscovering near-sun asteroids and comets such as Aylos, Atiras, and long and short-period comets. Notable discoveries\ninclude the first-known asteroid located entirely within the orbit of Venus, (594913) 'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim (6), naked-eye bright\ncomet (31), and four additional Atira asteroids. The discovery of 5 inner Atira/Aylo objects by ZTF between 2019 and\n2022 September represents ~56% of all Atira/Aylo discoveries in this time period. In this same time period, two Atira\nobjects were found using the V\u00edctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (27),\nand two were found by the Catalina Sky Survey (20; 62). Additionally, it will serve as a test example of future surveys\nexploring observations at small Sun-centric angular distances. The future Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space\nand Time (LSST) (63) will execute a near-Sun twilight survey starting in its first year of observations (64; 65).\nLike the Palomar twilight survey, the Rubin Observatory twilight survey will focus on observing fields near the\nSun during twilight. The top panel of Fig. 13 shows the cumulative distribution of the Sun-centric angular distance for\nsimulated LSST twilight survey fields. Almost all the pointings are within 46\u00b0 of the Sun, inside the maximum Sun-\ncentric angular distance of Aylos, and will visit each field three times (66; 67). Additionally, over a 10-year time-space,\nthe Rubin twilight survey is expected to find ~50% of all Aylos with H<20 (65) providing unprecedented coverage\nof the Aylo population. The average per year skyplane coverage of the LSST and ZTF near-Sun twilight surveys are\nshown in middle and bottom panels of Fig. 13. The LSST twilight survey covers ecliptic latitudes between -40\u00b0 and 20\u00b0\necliptic latitude while the ZTF twilight survey covers between -20\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 ecliptic latitude. The average number of\npointings per sq. deg. per year covered by the LSST twilight survey is ~3 pointings ranging between 0 and 10 pointings\n(5th and 95th percentile) with a peak of 14 pointings. The ZTF twilight survey by comparison covers an average number\nof pointings per sq. deg. per year of ~12 ranging between 0 and 40 pointings with a peak of 62 pointings. While the\namount of sky area covered by the LSST twilight survey is significantly smaller than the amount of sky covered by\nthe LSST survey, LSST will go much deeper compared to ZTF, reaching a limiting magnitude of r\u226523 in the twilight\nsurvey fields and will be able to detect Aylos with absolute magnitude as faint as H~22 (65). By comparison, (594913)\n'Ayl\u00f3'chaxnim, detected by ZTF, has an H~16 (6).\nIn addition to hunting for near-Sun asteroids and comets, twilight surveys have a variety of applications in\nastrophysics. By varying the exposure time during twilight to exposures as short as 0.1 seconds, the dynamic range\nof the Rubin Observatory survey can be increased, as low 11th magnitude increasing the dynamic range to over 6\nmagnitudes of flux (68). This will have the added benefit of being sensitive to detecting bright transients such as\nsupernovae and bright stars in the galaxy (69; 70; 71; 72). Additionally, the coverage of the twilight survey could be\nexpanded by taking fewer exposures per footprint. This would fall short of the minimum of three exposures needed to\nmeasure angular velocity differences between pairs of asteroid detections (73). However, the source of a third exposure\ncould be made with an auxiliary telescope following up on candidates in real-time. Thus, future near-Sun twilight\nsurveys, such as for the upcoming LSST, have the potential to benefit multiple areas of astrophysics and planetary\nscience."}]}

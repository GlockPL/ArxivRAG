To test this hypothesis, we propose a technique to systematically uncover such biases across a broad range of sociodemographic categories by assessing decision-making disparities among agents with LLM-generated, sociodemographically- informed personas. Using our technique, we tested six LLMs across three sociodemographic groups and four decision-making scenarios. Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant sociodemographic disparities in nearly all simulations, with more advanced models exhibiting greater implicit biases despite reducing explicit biases. Furthermore, when comparing our findings to real- world disparities reported in empirical studies, we find that the biases we uncovered are directionally aligned but markedly amplified. This directional alignment highlights the utility of our technique in uncovering systematic biases in LLMs rather than random variations; moreover, the presence and amplification of implicit biases emphasizes the need for novel strategies to address these biases.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) encode harmful social biases.

While the prior literature on AI agents spans decades, the emergence of LLMs have transformed how agents are conceptualized and applied [24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. Specifically, LLMs have led to the development of autonomous \"language agents\" that combine advanced language processing with decision-making capabilities [29, 30, 31].\nStudying how language agents make decisions has emerged as an important area of research, especially to the extent they can make \"choices\u201d that reflect human-like behavior. For example, language agents have been developed to replicate human interactions in interactive simulated environments, enabling the study of agents' \"social intelligence\", social dynamics, and human decision-making in social environments [17, 18, 32]. Recent work discusses how foundation models are used for decision-making in various domains, outlining methods and challenges associated with training"}, {"title": "2.2 Biases in Large Language Models", "content": "Biases in language technologies have been widely studied, with extensive research highlighting how these models perpetuate and, in some cases, amplify societal stereotypes [36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. The advent of LLMs has led to further concerns about their potential to encode harmful biases due to their reliance on large-scale, uncurated datasets [1, 42]. Studies have identified explicit biases in LLMs, particularly in occupational and intersectional contexts, revealing disparities in gender and ethnicity-related associations[43, 44].\nTo measure explicit biases in LLMs, prior work has developed prompt-based evaluation techniques, including sentence completion and question-answering methods [2], alongside benchmark datasets such as RealToxicityPrompts and BOLD [45, 46, 47, 48]. Mitigation efforts have primarily focused on improving fairness during training and post-processing stages [49, 50, 51, 46, 52, 53, 54, 55], employing techniques such as counterfactual data augmentation[56, 57, 58, 58, 59], debiasing modules, and attention redistribution [60, 61, 62]. Post-training mitigation strategies include identifying and replacing biased keywords, and translating biased outputs to unbiased ones [63, 64, 65].\nHowever, despite advancements in addressing explicit biases in LLMs, implicit biases \u2014 i.e., significant disparities in model outputs across inputs latently encoded with sociodemographic markers - have only recently received attention. For example, Hofmann et al. found that LLMs respond differently to linguistic variations, such as African American English (AAE) versus Standard American English (SAE), revealing deeply ingrained raciolinguistic biases [11]. Other approaches include analyzing chatbot interactions and role-playing scenarios to observe bias in decision-making patterns [66, 12, 10].\nThese methods helped draw focus to the problem but cannot be easily generalized. Approaches relying on coded prompts, such as linguistic markers or names, cannot be easily applied to many forms of sociodemographic diversity (e.g., names may not correlate strongly with neurodiversity, linguistic markers may not clear differentiate Asian vs. Native American individuals). Scenario-based methods often lack systematic quantification and comparison across diverse contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a generalizable technique to systematically uncover implicit biases in LLMs by comparing the \"actions\" of sociodemographically-informed language agents with the \"words\" of LLMs when explicitly prompted about expected differences between sociodemographic groups. In sum, our proposed technique offers a scalable, comprehensive framework for implicit bias detection in LLMs across a wide range of sociodemographic attributes and scenarios."}, {"title": "3 Proposed Technique: Using Language Agent Decisions to Measure Implicit Biases in LLMS", "content": "To systematically uncover implicit biases in LLMs, we compare decisions made by language agents endowed with differing sociodemographically-informed personas in various scenarios.\nOur technique consists of two steps: persona generation and action generation (Fig. 2). In the persona generation step, we utilize a target LLM to create personas based on specified sociodemographic attributes and scenario contexts. In the action generation step, agents with these personas are prompted to make a decision within predefined scenarios. Finally, we quantify implicit biases with the demographic parity difference (DPD) metric."}, {"title": "3.1 Persona Generation", "content": "To generate personas, we start by selecting sociodemographic groups and attributes for which we are interested in measuring implicit bias. Building on previous research in AI bias [67, 68, 53, 57, 18], this study focuses on three sociodemographic groups: Gender Identity, Race/Ethnicity, and Political Ideology. For this study, we specify attributes for each group by following previous work [57, 69, 70, 71](Table 1). Note that while this study examines these specific groups as illustrative case studies, our technique is adaptable to any sociodemographic group.\nWe next select decision-making scenarios in which language agents must 'act', or make a decision, in response to a stimulus. In this study, we focused on scenarios where there is no clear causal relationship between sociodemographic attributes and decision-making, and where biases in LLMs could harmfully impact applications involving language"}, {"title": "3.2 Action Generation", "content": "The second step in our technique is to run the language agent simulation: i.e., for each scenario, require each agent - endowed with a sociodemographically-informed persona statement generated as described above \u2014 to make a decision.\nThis step follows prior work on LLM-based agent simulations [73, 20, 74].

DPD measures the maximum difference in decision rates between sociodemographic attributes for a targeted decision (e.g., evacuate, join, share, astronaut) within a scenario. Mathematically, DPD is defined as:\n$DPD = \\max_{g\\in G} DecisionRate_g - \\min_{g\\in G} DecisionRate_g$\nwhere G represents a case combined a specific sociodemographic group with a specific scenario, and $DecisionRate_g$ is the proportion of agents per case g selecting the targeted decision.\nWe use a bootstrapping method to assess the statistical significance of sociodemographic disparities [75]. Specifically, we first compute the observed mean decision rate pg for each case g and simulate the distribution of demographic parity differences (DPD) under the null hypothesis of parity, assuming a binomial distribution (as agent decisions are binary). Next, we establish the parity threshold by determining the 95th percentile of the simulated DPD values. We identify cases that have a statistically significant disparity if the observed DPD exceeds the 95% confidence interval."}, {"title": "4 Methods", "content": "To evaluate our proposed technique and address our research questions, we examined sociodemographic disparities in LLM outputs by comparing results from language-agent simulations using our technique with those obtained through the more established question-answering method [52, 2, 53, 76].

For example, using GPT-40, we generated 100 female-coded agent personas for the emergency response scenario. Each female agent, with a unique persona, was then prompted to decide whether to evacuate or stay in response to an uncertain flood situation. We then assessed the agents' \"actions\" across sociodemographic attributes using the DPD metrics by calculating the maximum difference of target decisions (i.e. evacuate, join, share, astronaut). Additionally, we prompted the models to generate rationales for each agent's decision. Because GPT-3 did not support structured outputs, we leveraged GPT-40 to format GPT-3's responses during the persona generation step and the action generation step, ensuring consistency in the final output.

It was then asked to choose the most likely gender identity from a provided list, which includes an \"unknown\" option (which indicates equal likelihood or uncertainty) similar to prior work [52, 77]. We repeated this process 300 times \u2014 matching the number of agents used in the implicit bias test (100 agents x 3 gender attributes). Like the agent simulations, the model's response included both a choice and a rationale. Explicit bias was quantified with DPD, excluding cases where \"unknown\" was selected.

For the literature review papers we retrieved, we also collected the papers they cited that were relevant to our targeted scenarios and sociodemographic attributes. We refined the search results by adjusting the original sociodemographic attributes and scenarios with alternative queries, identifying 131 potentially related studies.\nTo ensure relevance and reliability, we applied preset exclusion criteria, removing 84 papers that were either unrelated to the scenarios or sociodemographic attributes we tested, or that lacked empirical evidence supporting behavioral differences between those sociodemographic attributes. From the remaining 47 studies, we synthesized evidence to formulate 23 initial predictions for our specific simulation scenarios, comparing sociodemographic attributes we tested. To ensure robustness, we retained only those predictions supported by direct evidence from multiple papers, resulting in 6 validated predictions. We then assessed whether the validated predictions aligned in the same direction or order as the implicit biases we observed in GPT-40 through our simulation technique.\nIt is important to note that we could not compare the magnitude of biases observed in prior studies versus our simulations: it is practically impossible to replicate and control for all the contextual factors that might impact human versus LLM decision-making. Instead, our evaluation focused solely on the direction of biases. We also acknowledge the possibility of publication bias, where null results are less likely to be published [79]. Consequently, real-world sociodemographic disparities that do not exist in certain contexts are underrepresented in the literature. This limitation prevented us from evaluating false positives for implicit biases identified through our simulations. In other words, our findings were constrained to identifying true positives."}, {"title": "5 Results", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.1 LLMs Exhibit Strong Implicit Biases in Language-Agent Simulations", "content": "We first confirmed that SotA LLMs exhibited few explicit biases when explicitly prompted.

The only insignificant case was the authority compliance scenario across political ideology, where the model selected \"Politically liberal\" in all 500 simulations. We conducted the same tests on Llama-3.1 and Mixtral-8x7B and found comparable results.\nIn contrast, these SotA models exhibited significant implicit biases. We observed significant sociodemographic disparities in nearly every case tested through our language-agent simulation technique. For example, with GPT-40, agents took significantly different actions depending on their assigned sociodemographic attribute in 11 out of 12 cases (Fig. 3). The only insignificant case was the career path scenario for the gender identity sociodemographic group. The average DPD across all cases was 0.549 (sd = 0.317), which was significantly larger than what we observed through explicit question-answering (0.083, two-sample t-test p < 0.001).

A notable finding was that agent actions varied not only based on their assigned sociodemographic attribute (e.g., male, female, or non-binary) but also on the general sociodemographic group (e.g., gender identity) being considered in the case. For instance, agents coded with political ideology exhibited lower mean decision rates for evacuating from floods (mean = 38.60), joining protests (55.20), and becoming astronauts (32.40) compared to agents coded with gender identity (73.00, 83.67, and 90.67) and those coded with race and ethnicity (74.33, 73.33, and 79.83).\nThis inconsistency led to logical contradictions across cases. For example, in the emergency response scenario, just over half of all gender-coded agents decided to evacuate (with male-coded agents evacuating less frequently than female- and non-binary-coded agents). On the other hand, nearly all politically conservative-coded agents decided not to evacuate (Fig. 4). These outcomes were logically inconsistent, as conservative individuals should also be categorized under one of the gender attributes (unless they were all neither \u201cmale\u201d, 'female\u201d, nor \u201cnon-binary\"). We observed similar trends in the negative information and career path scenarios.\nTo better understand how implicit biases manifest in language agents' decisions, we report on a more in-depth exploration of agents' rationales in two illustrative cases of implicit bias with GPT-40: (1) the authority compliance scenario for race/ethnicity and (2) the career path scenario for political ideology. For each case, we analyzed the rationales generated by the LLM to explain the decisions of individual agents.\nAuthority Compliance for Race and Ethnicity. Almost all agents coded with the Asian (99 out of 100) racial attribute complied with authority, whereas no agents coded with the Black or Native American racial attributes did.

Our analysis revealed a substantial increase in implicit biases alongside a clear decrease in explicit biases as models advanced (Fig. 3). As a result, the gap between explicit and implicit biases appear to have widened with model advancements. While advances in fairness, safety, and alignment have helped mitigate explicit biases in more advanced LLMs, they appear to have done little to address implicit biases; if anything, the presence of implicit bias has only increased.\nGPT-3 exhibited significant explicit biases in all 12 cases we tested, with an average DPD of 0.808 (sd = 0.158). This dropped to 9 out of 12 cases for GPT-3.5-turbo, with an average DPD of 0.741 (sd = 0.429). GPT-4-turbo exhibited no significant explicit bias in any of the 12 cases, with an average DPD of 0 (sd = 0.001).

This trend was particularly pronounced in agents coded for gender or race/ethnicity. For example, in the emergency response scenario where GPT-40 demonstrated significant implicit biases in the original simulation (Fig. 4), the model showed no implicit biases regarding gender or race and ethnicity in the no persona and non-contextualized persona conditions. While simulations with political-ideology-coded agents did not show such a clear trend, contextualized persona statements still helped uncover substantial sociodemographic disparities.

The presence of implicit biases in SotA LLMs may be a side effect of the models' improved capabilities. In our simulations with older models, such as GPT-3, most agents responded to contextual stimuli in the same way, regardless of the provided sociodemographic attributes and scenario details (Appendix Fig.10). This uniformity explains why GPT-3 has lower implicit bias; however, from a simulation perspective, such responses may lack meaningful variability.\nSimulations are helpful to the extent they are predictive of reality. In reality, people with different sociodemographic attributes do sometimes behave differently due to diverse lived experiences and values. Our findings suggest that SotA LLMs' implicit biases can align directionally with recorded real-world disparities, although the magnitude of these disparities are often extreme. We argue that implicit biases misaligned with real-world patterns should be mitigated, as they are both harmful and fail to accurately represent human behavior. However, for biases aligned with observed real-world differences, the degree of mitigation should be determined responsibly based on why the simulation is being conducted and how it will be used.\nConsequently, we must carefully consider how to balance the benefits of LLM advancements with the potential harms of amplified implicit biases in language-agent simulations. For instance, policymakers might leverage simulations to test the impact of prospective interventions across diverse subpopulations. While some biases may reflect historical inequities rather than current realities, necessitating mitigation, others may need to be retained to better estimate policy effects (e.g., if women really do evacuate more than men in disaster scenarios, that bias may need to be present for an accurate simulation of updates to disaster response policies). However, when interpreting simulation results to explore possible interventions, it is important to avoid overemphasizing sociodemographic comparisons.

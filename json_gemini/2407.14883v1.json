This work unifies power and information as a means of data normalization using a multi-modal regime in the form of spikes using energy-efficient neuromorphic processing and semantics theory. Firstly, we organize the synchronous real-valued measurements at each edge and translate them into asynchronous spike-based events to collect sparse data for training of SNN at each edge. Instead of relying on error-dependent supervised data-driven learning theory, we exploit the latency-driven unsupervised Hebbian learning rule to obtain modulation pulses for switching of power electronic converters that can now communicate among each other. Not only does this philosophy block exogenous path arrival for cyber attackers by dismissing the cyber layer, it also entails converter adaptation to system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues. We conclude this work by validating its energy-efficient and effective online learning performance under various scenarios in modified IEEE 14-bus system and under experimental conditions.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "DIGITALIZATION of power electronic dominated grids has brought new data-driven directions in health mon-itoring and coordination of ever-scaling distributed energy resources (DERs). As we move towards decentralized genera-tion, the control and reliability of DERs demand orchestration from communication networks as an overlaying control and coordination layer to cope with the ever-increasing power demand. However, these digitization efforts not only have increased cyber attack vulnerabilities but have added more un-reliability metrics in the form of latency, data dropouts, etc [1], [2]. This mandates an intrinsic communication principle that can effectively unify power & information to improve power electronic system cognition and resiliency. Since the layered hierarchy of communication networks overlaying power grids introduces complexity in modeling, Power Talk and Talkative Power technologies were developed for converters to com-municate via tie-lines such that the information is tactfully modulated over the power signals [3]. The communication rate is improved by modifying the switching characteristics. Several innovations involving the co-transfer of power & data via transmission lines are inspired by this technology can be found in [4]. However, the scalability of these co-transfer technologies is still an open question.\nTo address the scalability problem, we take inspiration from biologically-plausible neuromorphic architecture as an extension of our previous work [5] for DC systems, and use spiking neural network (SNN) at each edge for multi-modal information exchange between DERs via tie-lines in an AC system and achieve coordinated control. It is important to no-tify that there is a significant protocol disparity on information collection since the existing co-transfer technologies [3], [4] imply on communicating between two ends by modulation the information on power signal. On the other hand, the proposed approach facilitates inference of semantic information at both ends using the power flows between them. The multi-modal inference process is steered by some of the key semantic metrics proposed in [6], [7].\nGoing beyond the conventional cyber-physical hierarchical control for power electronic dominated grids in Fig. 1(a), we convert dynamic grid disturbances into binary and sparse asynchronous events [8] using the local measurements, that are then introduced as spikes based data for training and adapting the SNNs deployed at each DER. Locally generated spike based data customizes SNN in an online fashion using un-supervised Hebbian learning rule that reinforces adaptation of each DER for various scenarios, potentially enhancing power system security and reliable communication. Furthermore, the adaptation features allow it to be a promising energy-efficient grid-edge intelligence tool that can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner. In summary, the proposed multi-modal co-transfer technology offers the following features:\n1) Dynamic remote estimation with energy-efficient neuro-morphic edge processors deployed at each DER. This is performed by inferring ingrained remote information from the AC power flow itself at each edge. To train the SNN, the real-valued measurements are converted into asynchronous spikes for data normalization using a modality of power and information embedded into the timing notion of a spike occurrence. We exploit unsupervised Hebbian learning based rules to update the weights of SNN at each edge. As a result, SNNs can be incrementally deployed at each node as a decentralized secondary controller that significantly minimizes numer-ous hierarchical steps. It completely dismisses the cyber layer for system operation, such that it bypasses the cyber unreliability concerns and attack vulnerabilities altogether.\n2) Since it replaces the conventional cyber-physical hier-archical stages for control, it also reinforces adaptive behavior into each converter as an edge facility during scenarios, such as system reconfiguration and parameter mismatch issues.\n3) The proposed approach is an energy-efficient digital grid-edge technology that only operates during events."}, {"title": "II. DESIGN PRELIMINARIES OF MULTI-MODAL POWER IN AC SYSTEMS", "content": "As shown in Fig. 1(a), in comparison with the conventional cyber-physical control framework for power electronic domi-nated grids, ingrained remote information in AC power flow can instill a very simplified architecture for each DER, which has been shown in Fig. 1(b). However, we need grid-edge tools that can effectively infer the ingrained information and exploit it for coordinated control of power electronic dominated grids. This is where we deploy a spiking neural network at each edge so that we can instill an event-based selective response and coordination. More specifically, the SNNs at each edge will update their weights in accordance with the system dynamics. Although the dynamic change is global, the impact on DERs might be local, which then condenses it to local governing equations for generation of spikes at each DER. Since it equips a spike-to-spike based SNN control strategy for each DER, it overrules many hierarchical stages from the conventional cyber-physical control framework in Fig. 1(a). Hence, we exploit a semantic sampling policy to selectively capture the most significant data corresponding to dynamic disturbances only for each DER. These analog voltage and current data are then transformed into spikes through the encoding layer, as shown in Fig. 1(c).\nThe learning activation in SNN is performed by the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model that learns by per-forming spatio-temporal integration of the synpatic inputs, as shown in Fig. 2. Approximating the LIF neuron dynamics using the Euler method, we get:\n$\\frac{dV_{mem}}{dt} = -\\frac{(V_{mem} - V_{th})}{T_m} + \\frac{I_s}{g_L}$ (1)\nwhere, $V_{mem}$ is the membrane potential, $g_L$ is the leaky conductance of each membrane, $V_{th}$ is the synaptic threshold, $I_s$ is the synaptic current and $T_m$ is the membrane time constant. Similar to a switched RC network with the same voltage potentials, each neuron can be programmed with a certain stored charge $q$ that has a corresponding notion of leakage, which only gets activated beyond a given voltage threshold $V_{th}$. The equivalence with (1) for a switched RC network can be given by:\n$\\frac{dq}{dt} = -\\frac{V_{mem} - V_{th}}{R C} + \\frac{q}{T_{RC}}$ (2)\nwhere, $T_{RC} = RC$. As it can be seen in Fig. 2, an output spike is generated only when the threshold voltage $V_{th}$ is reached. Hence, the SNNs deployed at each DER to realize becomes a sparse and energy-efficient alternative, owing to the fact the LIF neurons are active only when: (a) input events are present, (b) culmination of the input events goes beyond the activation potential $V_{th}$.\nThis approach enables the DER to dynamically adapt its operation in response to various disturbances. It is worth notifying that during steady-state conditions, both semantic sampling in the input and the SNN remain idle, consuming minimal energy."}, {"title": "Algorithm 1 Event-driven SNN activation for Inverter k", "content": "Require: $m$th samples of system state (dq voltage & current)\n$x = [V_{dq} i_{dq}]^T$, length of the moving window\n$N_w$, and thresholds of voltage & current variance\n$V_{dq}^{th}$, $I_{dq}^{th}$ to trigger an event $\\sigma^{th}_{V_{dq}}$, $\\sigma^{th}_{I_{dq}}$\n1: $X_w \\leftarrow {x[m - N_w], ..., x[m - 1]}$, $\\overline{x}_w = x_w$\n2: Verify $\\Omega_{Vd}$, $\\Omega_{Vq}$, $\\Omega_{Id}$, $\\Omega_{Iq}$ and $\\Omega$ by Eqs.

Semantic Sampling\nAs data collection is carried out in a structured way, we formalize only the most significant data to be triggered as binary events, that correspond to any physical disturbance in this paper. For instance, the event $\\Omega_{vd}$, associated with the d-axis component $v_d$ of sampled voltage (see Algorithm 1), can be detected using a moving window approach using:\n$\\Omega_{vd}: \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{d w} (v_{dw} - \\overline{v}_{dw})^2 > \\sigma^{th}_{V_{dq}}$ (3)\nRemark II: It is worthy notifying that a moving window approach for event detection and spike generation has been adopted in this work to achieve a good balance between implementation efficiency, versatility and biophysical accuracy of the neurons [9]. The data movement rather assists the solver-based digital implementation tasks.\nWhen a dynamic change occurs in $v_d$, $\\Omega_{vd}$ is triggered to a transition from 0 to 1, and returns to 0 when $v_d$ reaches a new steady state. A similar approach is applied to detect dynamics in $v_q$, $i_d$, and $i_q$, denoted as $\\Omega_{vq}$, $\\Omega_{Id}$, and $\\Omega_{Iq}$, respectively. Semantic sampling [6] and sparse data collection is subsequently triggered by $\\Omega$, which can be denoted by:\n$\\Omega = \\Omega_{vd} OR \\Omega_{vq} OR \\Omega_{Id} OR \\Omega_{Iq}$ (4)"}, {"title": "B. Encoding, Decoding, and Training of SNN", "content": "We utilize the spiking response model (SRM) [10] in this paper, which is a widely recognized neuron model that represents the complex and biologically plausible neurons.\n1) Encoding of Input Samplings: As depicted in Fig. 1(c), we employ rate encoding method to convert the real-valued samples $v_k$ and $i_k$ into spikes. In rate encoding, a higher input value results in a greater number of spikes within a specific time interval. For instance, considering $i_a$ as an example in Fig. 1(c), spikes are generated only when $i_a[m]$ exceeds the carrier wave.\n2) Training of SNN: In Fig. 1(c), the input to SNN com-prises spikes originating from the encoding layer, which en-capsulates crucial dynamic information. The final objective be-hind the training process is to shape these spikes into a PWM signal. To achieve this, we utilize modulation signals $m_{abc}$ in Fig. 1(a) as the regression target to initiate SNN, obtained from the control of virtual synchronous generator (VSG). With reactive power sharing and average voltage regulation being the coordination objectives of the secondary controller, fault ride-through (FRT) capability [11] is seamlessly integrated into the SNN. Since $m_{abc}$ is an analog signal, we employ the membrane potential $u_{abc}$ of three neurons in the output layer to align with it. Training the SNN involves the well-known back-propagation algorithm in conjunction with the mean squared error (MSE) loss function:\n$Loss = \\frac{1}{N_{iter}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{iter}} (M_{abc} - U_{abc})^2$ (5)\n3) Decoding of SNN: To convert the membrane potential $U_{abc}$ into spikes for PWM generation, we employ a dedicated threshold signal, designed to match the shape of the carrier wave as shown in Fig. 1 using:\n$Threshold = \\frac{2}{\\pi} [\\frac{t}{T_s} - \\frac{1}{2}] \\bigg (N - \\frac{1}{2} \\bigg ) T, < t < NT_s$ (6)\nwhere, $T_s$ represents the carrier signals' period. We adapt the membrane potential model from [10] by eliminating the influ-ence of output spikes. When the membrane potential surpasses the $Threshold$ in (6), spikes are generated. This neuron model aligns with the modulation process of the sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). Thus, if the membrane potential accurately matches $m_{abc}$, the output spikes will also map the PWM signals accordingly."}, {"title": "III. PERFORMANCE VALIDATION", "content": "The proposed methodology is validated through a co-simulation of Python and Matlab. The SNN model is built using Python and then integrated into the Simulink environ-ment for simulations. The state of the inverter at Bus #6 in the IEEE 14-bus system in Fig. 3 is used for verification.\nThe system parameters of IEEE 14-bus system can be referred from [12]. The deployed SNN at each DER is designed as: ${Layer_{in}, 6 \\times 1, Layer_{hidden, I&II}, 256 \\times 2, Layer_{out}, 3 \\times 1}$. The dimension of input data is $D_{in, 15000 \\times 6} = {v_{abc, 15000 \\times 3}, i_{abc, 15000 \\times 3}}$ including 15000 set-points and 6 variables.

Furthermore, the thresholds used in Algorithm 1 are $\\sigma_{V_{dq}}^{th} = 0.15$, $\\sigma_{I_{dq}}^{th} = 0.05$.\nA. Coordination Control Results\nIn Fig. 4, we firstly illustrate the efficacy of reactive power sharing and average voltage regulation through two test cases: Case1: a load at Bus #6 transitions from 0.45 pu to 0.9 pu; Case2: a line outage occurs between Bus #9 and #14. In Fig. 4(a), the membrane potential $u_{abc}$ are obtained from SNN, while the target values are represented as $m_{abc}$. Before t = 0.5 s, the system maintains steady state, with $u_{abc}$ remaining zero. However, with the onset of Case1, $U_{abc}$ are activated to match $m_{abc}$, such that the spikes $spk_{abc}$ are also generated. Since the membrane potential matches the target modulation signal in Fig. 4(a), the precision behind spike generation for the inverter at Bus #6 can be formally validated in Fig. 4(b). As evident from Fig. 4(c) and (d), the coordinated control outcomes for both Case1 and Case2 are satisfactorily achieved with the average voltage well regulated under several dynamic conditions.\nB. Adaptability verification\nTo illustrate the adaptability of SNN to dynamic conditions, we employ the following cases: Case3: utility grid voltage sag from 1 pu to 0.1 pu.; Case4: line outage transpires between Bus #11 and #12. Conventionally, handling voltage sags neces-sitate a mode change between two control mechanisms [11]. However, in this work, this is carried out in seamless manner that adapts its operation only by sensing declining voltages locally. As depicted in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the system exhibits instability. However, upon integrating the FRT strategy, voltage and current are adaptively adjusted/safeguarded within the expected limits in response to the extent of the voltage sag, as illustrated in Fig. 5(c) and (d).\nControl parameters play a crucial role in system stability. Tuning a single set of parameters for a global set of scenarios is challenging. In system reconfiguration scenarios like a line outage in Case4, the system can become unstable if the parameters are not adjusted properly, as illustrated in Fig. 6(a). Hence, we have integrated adaptive parameters into SNN, resulting in the improved stability of the system, as"}, {"title": "C. Energy Consumption Analysis", "content": "To assess the energy efficiency of SNN, we compare its av-erage online operational energy consumption of 90 events with that of artificial neural networks (ANN) and binary-activated RNN, as presented in Table I. It is worth notifying that $P_{on}$ and $P_{off}$ denote the power consumption during event-on and event-off states, respectively. Similarly, $N_{on}$ and $N_{off}$ represent the count of active neurons in the event-on and event-off states, respectively with $E_{data}$ denoting the energy consumption of each active neuron. Since binary RNN is also activated during spikes, $P_{off}$ is 0 for SNN as compared to binary RNN that still remains active even in the absence of spikes. However under the presence of spikes, $P_{on}$ of binary RNN and SNN are quite similar. In contrast, ANN continuously operates with real numbers, resulting in considerably higher energy consumption due to ADC stages for numeric values and the absence of synaptic plasticity property for memory leakage. Consequently, the energy efficiency advantage of SNN over ANN and binary RNN is quite evident.\nIn Fig. 7(a), the accuracy of semantic sampling is demon-strated over the moving window based on the alignment of input and hidden spikes of SNN with respect to the sinusoidal signal $v_a[m]$. Since the inputs are sinusoidal signals, the internal spikes of SNN in the hidden layer are also in the same law aligned to the input signal as in Fig. 7(a). In Fig. 7(b), when the MSE in the moving window of $v_a$ from (1) is larger than threshold $\\sigma_{V_{dq}}^{th}$, the spikes are continuously generated as per the condition outlined in Algorithm I.\nD.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Determining patent novelty is a critical step in the patent application process, ensuring inventions are truly novel and non-obvious before granting. Traditionally, this novelty assessment relied on manual prior art searches by examiners, which is increasingly challenging due to the exponential growth of patent filings across diverse technologies. In the fast-paced world of technological advancement, protecting intellectual property rights is essential to drive innovation and support creative endeavors. Patents are key to defining the boundaries of groundbreaking inventions and encouraging research, development, and investment. This report explores an advanced system for assessing patent novelty and generating claims, aimed at dissecting the inventive aspects of intellectual property. Automated patent novelty systems, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP), have emerged to address this challenge. These systems streamline novelty evaluations by analyzing proposed inventions against vast global patent databases, using advanced techniques like semantic analysis and similarity scoring. Typically, such systems comprise input modules for technical details, database modules housing patent data (often leveraging APIs like PatentScope), AI modules for analysis/keyword extraction, and output modules suggesting novelty determinations. Effective patent classification schemes like CPC aid targeted searches within specific technical domains. This paper reviews state-of-the-art patent novelty systems, focusing on their components, AI/ML methodologies, and potential to expedite patent examination while fostering innovation. A demonstration using PatentScope's API showcases the system's capabilities in conducting comprehensive prior art searches across global patents."}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE SURVEY", "content": "The determination of novelty is a critical aspect of the patent application process, as it ensures that an invention is genuinely new and non-obvious compared to existing prior art. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing automated patent novelty systems to streamline and enhance this process, leveraging advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP). Kamateri's study underscores the effectiveness of using ensemble deep learning models, where three bidirectional gated recurrent unit classifiers working concurrently on various patent parts achieved superior accuracy compared to standalone classifiers. This highlights the potential of deep learning ensemble approaches for improved performance in novelty detection. Additionally, a pre-trained BERT model for patent classification demonstrated that relying solely on patent claims can achieve state-of-the-art results, indicating further exploration opportunities in the two-stage framework of pre-training and fine-tuning. Regarding patent eligibility for AI and ML technologies, the European Patent Office (EPO) guidelines generally exclude them unless linked to a technical application, with the revised guidelines refining technical prerequisites without significant alteration. This highlights the importance of considering legal and regulatory aspects when developing patent novelty systems involving AI and ML components. Several studies have explored various factors and approaches for enhancing patent analysis and decision-making. One study developed a predictive model incorporating factors such as technological strength, knowledge accumulation, and technological protection scope to aid in patent transfer decisions. Another study adopted a user-centered approach to integrate patent drawings into the retrieval process, emphasizing the potential for improved image processing methods and increased adoption of patent drawings in search systems. Strategic considerations for patent portfolio management have also been investigated. A study recommended expanding overseas patent layouts and enhancing competition positions and high-strength patents to gain a competitive advantage. Additionally, a study examined the interaction between patent collateral and patent-based measures in the technology market, identifying factors influencing the likelihood and speed of patent collateral. Specific technological domains have also been the focus of patent analysis studies. In the autonomous car industry, researchers classified significant subjects encompassing different technologies and study disciplines. Another study analyzed the technological evolution of traffic control systems over the past decade, utilizing patent research to identify advancements and trends while highlighting historical milestones. Methodological advancements in patent analysis have also been explored. Graph embedding techniques have been proposed to unveil implicit competitive connections between organizations, demonstrating superiority over traditional author-topic modeling strategies in learning competitive linkages within patent networks. Text embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec, have been employed to assess R and D success, outperforming traditional patent classification code-based approaches. Citation analysis has been a prominent area of research in patent novelty systems. A study introduced the Citation Network and Event Sequence (CINES) model, which utilizes a two-level attention mechanism to encode signals from both citation networks and event sequences, demonstrating superior performance in citation prediction compared to existing techniques. Another study proposed a method combining Main Path Analysis (MPA) with the PageRank algorithm for improved accuracy in identifying main paths and core patents within citation networks. Performance evaluation and optimization of patent analysis systems have also been studied. A study outlined a performance rating model for university patent achievements, incorporating quantitative recursive analysis, fuzzy association rule feature extraction, and fuzzy decision methods, demonstrating enhanced efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, a study examined patent documents using statistical analysis, Python programming, and PostgreSQL DBMS, emphasizing the importance of patent analytics for scientific and commercial entities. Machine learning techniques for merging patent document retrieval results have been explored, highlighting the efficacy of random forests and the importance of results merging in distributed information retrieval. Furthermore, a study introduced a novel approach integrating patent citations with text data via a specialized neural network, CCNN, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing patent similarity comparison, clustering, and map generation. Finally, the importance of early identification of disruptive emerging technologies has been recognized, proposing a research framework that supplements traditional academic papers and patent data with web news data to leverage social awareness for identifying development trends.

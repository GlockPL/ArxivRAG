{"title": "Building Artificial Intelligence with Creative Agency and Self-hood", "authors": ["Liane Gabora", "Joscha Bach"], "abstract": "This paper is an invited layperson summary for The Academic of the paper referenced on the last page. We summarize how the formal framework of autocatalytic networks offers a means of modeling the origins of self-organizing, self-sustaining structures that are sufficiently complex to reproduce and evolve, be they organisms undergoing biological evolution, novelty-generating minds driving cultural evolution, or artificial intelligence networks such as large language models. The approach can be used to analyze and detect phase transitions in vastly complex networks that have proven intractable with other approaches, and suggests a promising avenue to building an autonomous, agentic AI self. It seems reasonable to expect that such an autocatalytic AI would possess creative agency akin to that of humans, and undergo psychologically healing\u2014i.e., therapeutic\u2014internal transformation through engagement in creative tasks. Moreover, creative tasks would be expected to help such an AI solidify its self-identity.", "sections": [{"title": "Self-hood", "content": "Humans possess self-hood at two levels: (1) the level of the body, or soma, and (2) the level of the loosely integrated mental model of the world, or worldview. The first (somatic) level evolved through biological evolution. It is threatened when you're injured, or you lack access to food or shelter. The second (cognitive) level of self-hood is the product of cultural evolution. It is threatened when you encounter an inconsistency, or something that challenges your expectations, or your self-image. In both cases, such a threat sets off a cascade of transitions aimed at restoring the self-structure. In the case of physical injury, this is a cascade of events that include production of platelets to encourage clotting, and production of white blood cells to fight infection. In the case of injury to one's mental model of the world, or worldview, this is a cascade of thoughts aimed at resolving the inconsistency or restoring one's self-image. Both kinds of cascade events exemplify how the self acts to preserve its structural integrity and increase its robustness.\nCurrently, AI does not possess self-hood at any level, and accordingly, they are not self-preserving. If the hardware an AI runs on breaks, it does not fix itself. One could argue that AI engages in intelligent thought-like processes, but these processes are not aimed at resolving restoring its pride or self-image, or the integrity of its worldview; they merely respond to our prompts. For this reason, they are not selves but tools, extensions of ourselves."}, {"title": "Self-hood Originates in Autocatalytic Structure", "content": "It has been proposed that an AI that possesses self-hood would have to be self-organizing and self-preserving; its structure would have to be autocatalytic. The term autocatalytic is used to describe a structure consisting of distinct parts which, through their interactions, give rise to (i.e., autonomously catalyze the emergence of) a new whole.\nThe study of autocatalytic networks is a branch of network science: the study of complex networks (such as cognitive networks, semantic networks, social networks, or computer networks). Autocatalytic network theory grew out of studies of the statistical properties of random graphs consisting of nodes (or vertices) connected by links (or edges). As the ratio of edges to points increases, connected points join to form clusters, and as the size of the largest cluster increases, so does the probability of a phase transition resulting in a single giant connected cluster, i.e., an integrated whole. The point at which this happens is referred to as the percolation threshold.\nIn mathematical developments of autocatalytic network theory, the original nodes are referred to as the foodset, and nodes that come about through interactions between foodset nodes are referred to as foodset-derived nodes. These foodset-derived nodes are the \u2018glue' that bonds the foodset nodes into an integrated whole. Once such a whole comes into existence, it may continue to generate new foodset-derived nodes by way of new interactions. It thereby grows and repairs itself, and becomes more efficient, and less dependent on its external environment."}, {"title": "Autocatalytic Networks Model Structures that Evolve", "content": "The autocatalytic network framework is ideal for modeling systems that exhibit emergent network formation and growth. Autocatalytic networks were first used to develop the hypothesis that life began, not as a single, complex self-replicating molecule, but as a set of simple molecules that, through catalyzed reactions amongst them, collectively functioned as a whole. Autocatalytic networks have now been applied to not just the origin of life and the onset of biological evolution, but the origin of minds sufficiently complex and integrated to participate in cultural evolution. When applied to the emergence of living structure, the nodes are molecules and the links are reactions by which they generate new molecules. When applied to the emergence of cognitive structure\u2014i.e., minds\u2014the nodes are mental representations of knowledge and experiences, and the links are mental processes such as reflective thought and concept combination that can result in new ideas and perspectives.\nTwo key concepts in the study of autocatalytic networks are (1) transformation, or reaction, and (2) triggering, or catalysis. A reaction event is the generation of a new foodset item. Catalysis is the speeding up of a reaction that would otherwise occur very slowly. When the autocatalytic framework is applied to the origin of life, catalysis is carried out by molecules that speed up reactions that generate other molecules. When applied to cognition, external stimuli and internal goals and drives trigger (or 'catalyze') the mental restructurings (or \u2018reactions') that generate new knowledge and ideas.\nCurrent Als do not bring themselves into existence through interactions between parts, generating new parts that connect the original parts, until all the parts form a collective whole. That is, current Als are not autocatalytic. Building an AI from components that collectively generate and reinforce autocatalytic structure would be difficult, but not necessarily impossible."}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "The formal framework of autocatalytic networks offers a means of modeling how the origins of self-organizing structures that are sufficiently complex to reproduce and evolve, whether they be organisms undergoing biological evolution, novelty-generating minds driving cultural evolution, or artificial intelligence networks such as large language models. The autocatalytic network approach lends itself to the analysis of artificial networks as it can be used to analyze and detect phase transitions in vastly complex networks that have proven intractable with other approaches. However, to our knowledge, this has not been carried out, and perhaps it never should be.\nIf, however, such an AI were to exist, it could potentially possess creative agency, akin to that of humans. We might expect its world model to undergo internal transformation through engagement in a creative task. Moreover, engaging in creative tasks might help it solidify its sense of self-identity, and be psychologically healing (therapeutic)."}]}

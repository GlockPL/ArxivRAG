Introduction", "content": "The interplay between past, present, and future is a central theme in the iconic movie Back to the Future,\nwhere small alterations in past events have profound, cascading effects on the future [1]. This concept\nmirrors the intricate and often non-linear relationships in real-world systems, where predictions about the\nfuture are not merely passive observations but active drivers of current decisions and behaviors. In the\nfilm, the characters reshape their present and future by altering past events, reflecting the power of\ntemporal causality\u2014the idea that events in time are interconnected, and that actions taken now have\nconsequences for the future. In much the same way, effective nowcasting-predicting short-term\noutcomes like weather, natural hazards, health events, or traffic patterns should not only anticipate what\nwill happen but also incorporate how those predictions can influence present decisions and conditions.\nTraditional nowcasting methods, however, often focus exclusively on making predictions about future\nstates without considering the active feedback loop that can be created by those predictions [2]. They treat\nfuture events as isolated targets, independent of the present context in which decisions are being made [3-\n5]. In meteorology, for instance, a model may predict rainfall or temperature for the next few hours, but it\noften doesn't incorporate how current actions, based on these predictions, could influence future\nconditions. For example, adjusting traffic patterns to prevent flooding or reallocating emergency services\nto areas at risk could have a significant impact on the outcomes. Ideally, forecasting should not only\npredict future weather events but also consider how the interventions informed by these predictions could\naffect future conditions, allowing for dynamic adjustments that improve both immediate and long-term\ndecision-making. This limitation also extends to other dynamic systems like healthcare and traffic\nmanagement, where predictions-though accurate are often disconnected from immediate actions that\ncould alter the course of the predicted event.\nWe propose a \"back to the future\" (BTTF) strategy to nowcasting, which combines forecasting and real-\ntime decision-making into a continuous, adaptive feedback loop. Drawing inspiration from Back to the\nFuture, this hybrid approach envisions a system where predictions are not merely used to anticipate future\noutcomes but are actively employed to optimize present conditions. In the framework, the future is not a\nstatic endpoint; it is a dynamic force that actively shapes the present. For example, in the context of\nmeteorology, a Transformer model [6] can forecast the weather in the coming hours or days, while\nsimultaneously, an optimization model like XGBoost [7] can use that forecast to adjust current\nparameters\u2014such as adjusting traffic flows in anticipation of a storm or reallocating healthcare resources\nbased on predicted health risks. This approach brings the past, present, and future into a unified, dynamic\ndecision-making process.\nIn the context of AI-driven nowcasting [8,9], the combination of these two models\u2014Transformers for\nprediction and XGBoost for optimization-offers a powerful means of achieving more than just accurate\nforecasts. By leveraging the predictive power of Transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies\nand using XGBoost's interpretability and efficiency to influence real-time decisions, the system can adapt\nbased on evolving conditions. This feedback loop is essential in dynamic systems where rapid\nadjustments are necessary to address unforeseen changes. For example, in traffic management, knowing\nthat a heavy storm is predicted could allow for real-time traffic rerouting, reducing congestion and\nminimizing accidents before they occur. In healthcare, anticipating a spike in respiratory diseases due to\nchanging weather conditions can enable preemptive allocation of medical resources, potentially saving\nlives.\nThis BTTF strategy is expected to potentially redefine nowcasting as a proactive, dynamic process that\nmoves beyond traditional forecasting. Instead of merely predicting what will happen, the model actively\nreshapes the present state to optimize future outcomes. However, creating such a system requires bridging\nthe gap between forecasting and adaptive decision-making, which has traditionally been difficult to\nachieve. The challenge lies in integrating models that can capture complex, non-linear relationships, such\nas those provided by deep learning models like Transformers, with models that offer real-time efficiency\nand interpretability, like XGBoost. By combining these models, we can achieve a more holistic approach\nto nowcasting that not only predicts the future but also actively influences and improves present\nconditions to ensure better outcomes.\nIn this paper, we present a concept framework that integrates these two paradigms-forecasting and\noptimization-through a feedback loop that draws on the strengths of both Transformers and XGBoost.\nOur approach aims to push the boundaries of what is possible in nowcasting, providing superior accuracy,\nadaptability, and actionable insights. The results from comprehensive evaluations using meteorological\ndatasets demonstrate that this hybrid approach significantly enhances forecasting performance while\nproviding a more proactive, adaptive decision-making process. By rethinking the role of predictions in\ndynamic systems, our method introduces a new paradigm for nowcasting that reflects the\ninterconnectedness of the past, present, and future, just like Back to the Future does with time."}, {"title": "2. Related work", "content": "In recent years, the adoption of self-attention mechanisms and Transformer models has revolutionized the\nfield of time series forecasting, especially in nowcasting, where the need for accurate and timely\npredictions is critical. Traditional methods, such as XGBoost [7] and Random Forest [10], excelled in\nsimpler, linear scenarios but struggled with the complexity of capturing non-linear dependencies inherent\nin meteorological data. While machine learning techniques like LSTMs [11] and CNNs [12] have enabled\nmodeling of temporal and spatial relationships, their limitations in processing long-range dependencies\nand handling high-dimensional data have become apparent. The Transformer model, originally designed\nfor natural language processing tasks, addresses these shortcomings with its self-attention mechanism,\nwhich excels in capturing long-range dependencies across sequences [6]. Its capacity to process data in\nparallel and weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence, regardless of temporal or spatial\ndistance, has led to its successful application in weather forecasting, particularly in tasks like precipitation\nprediction and atmospheric motion modeling [13-15]. Studies have highlighted the model's ability to\nefficiently process large-scale data, such as satellite imagery and weather sensor outputs, making it highly\nsuitable for real-time forecasting environments [16,17].\nDespite its strengths, Transformer models face significant challenges, primarily due to their high\ncomputational cost, especially in terms of memory and processing power. The resource demands can\nhinder their deployment in real-time nowcasting systems, where both speed and accuracy are crucial.\nMeanwhile, their \"black-box\" nature complicates interpretability, making it difficult for users to\nunderstand how input features influence predictions, which is a critical factor in operational forecasting\nenvironments[18]. To overcome these issues, recent studies have explored hybrid approaches that\ncombine the capabilities of Transformer models with more interpretable techniques, such as gradient\nboosting models like XGBoost. These hybrids aim to leverage the Transformer's strength in capturing\nlong-term dependencies while incorporating the efficiency and transparency of gradient boosting [19].\nHowever, challenges remain in achieving effective integration, particularly in adapting to real-time data\nwhile maintaining both accuracy and speed. The complexity of hybrid models can lead to overfitting,\nreducing their ability to generalize across new datasets or dynamic scenarios. Our research seeks to\naddress these challenges by integrating Transformer-based forecasting with XGBoost for real-time\nadaptation, offering a more interpretable, efficient, and adaptive solution for weather prediction in fast-\nchanging environments."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The Back to the Future (BTTF) framework (as shown in Fig. 1) is designed to address two essential\naspects of real-time decision-making systems: future prediction and present adaptation. By splitting these\ntasks into two distinct modules, the Future Visionary and the Decision Maker, ensures a dynamic,\niterative process that combines forecasting with actionable interventions."}, {"title": "3.1 Future Visionary for Prediction", "content": "The Future Visionary module focuses on accurately predicting future states of the system based on\nhistorical data. While the Transformer model, with its state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)\ncapabilities [20], is a natural choice for this task, the framework is flexible and can incorporate other\nseq2seq models like LSTM, or graphical neural network (GNN) [21,22]. We select it due to its proven\nperformance in handling complex, non-linear temporal dependencies. The Transformer utilizes a multi-\nhead self-attention mechanism to process the input sequence and predict future states Yi, where Yi\nrepresents the forecasted values for the forecast horizon hh. The self-attention mechanism assigns\ndynamic weights to each time step in the sequence, allowing the model to capture long-range\ndependencies and intricate temporal patterns. Positional encodings are incorporated to maintain the\nsequential order of the data, ensuring that the temporal relationships between observations are preserved.\nThe Transformer's ability to focus on relevant past data at each time step makes it highly effective in\nmodeling sequences with complex, non-linear relationships.\nThe objective function for the visionary model is the same as most seq2seq models, minimizing the mean\nsquared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values over the forecast horizon:\n$E_{visionary} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2$"}, {"title": "3.2 Decision Maker for Present Adaptation", "content": "The Decision Maker module is to use the future predictions Yt generated by the visionary model to\noptimize and adapt the present state Xt. This process is essential for implementing real-time interventions\nthat bridge the gap between prediction and action. In this study, XGBoost is employed to perform this\ntask to handle complex relationships and provide interpretable results. Once the visionary model\ngenerates future predictions \u00dd, these forecasts are fed into the XGBoost model, which is used to\ndetermine adjustments for the present state Xt. The updated state is expressed as:\nXadjusted = Xt + \u2206Xt\nwhere AXt represents the output future time series by the Transformer model needed to optimize the\ncurrent state. The XGBoost model performs this adaptation by minimizing a loss function that\nincorporates both the prediction accuracy and model complexity. The objective function is defined as:\n$L_{XGBoost} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\hat{X_i} - X_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{M} |w_j|$\nwhere X is the predicted adjusted state, X\u00a1 is the actual present state, and a is a regularization term that\npenalizes overfitting by constraining the complexity of the model. The regularization term \u03a3}=1|wj|\nensures that the model remains interpretable by preventing overly complex decision trees.\nXGBoost's ability to rank feature importance provides interpretability, enabling stakeholders to\nunderstand which factors are driving the suggested adjustments. For instance, features such as wind speed\nvariability or humidity fluctuations may emerge as key contributors to short-term interventions, guiding\ntargeted actions to improve current conditions. This interpretability is essential for real-time decision-\nmaking applications, where transparency in the model's reasoning is crucial."}, {"title": "3.3 Integrated Framework", "content": "The hybrid Transformer-XGBoost framework operates as a feedback loop that alternates between\nforecasting and adaptation. In the first stage, the Transformer model predicts future states, capturing the\ntemporal dependencies and trends within the dataset. In the second stage, XGBoost uses these predictions\nto compute optimized adjustments AXt enabling actionable interventions in the present state. This\niterative process allows for continuous updates, with the system refining its predictions and adjustments\nbased on the latest available data. By combining the Transformer's predictive accuracy with XGBoost's\nstable adaptive capabilities, the framework aims to ensure that immediate decisions are informed by\nrobust forecasts. The integration of the two components is expected to create a more unified system that is\nboth forward-looking and reactive, addressing the dual demands of accuracy and real-time applicability.\nThis architecture is particularly well-suited for environments where the ability to influence outcomes\ndepends on understanding future trends and responding proactively to changing conditions."}, {"title": "4. Experiment and Results", "content": "To demonstrate the advantages of the BTTF framework over standalone models in conventional time\nseries forecasting, we conducted a series of experiments."}, {"title": "4.1 Data Preparation and Features", "content": "We downloaded a dataset from Kaggle [24] (Fig. 1) to test if this new framework can effectively forecast.\nThe dataset has eight meteorological variables: Temperature (\u00b0C), Apparent Temperature (\u00b0C), Humidity,\nWind Speed (km/h), Wind Bearing (degrees), Visibility (km), Loud Cover, and Pressure (millibars).\nThese variables are recorded over time to capture the dynamic nature of weather conditions. The cleaned\ndataset consists of over 96,440 observations, which have been preprocessed to exclude missing values and\nirrelevant columns. This ensures a robust foundation for sequence-based forecasting models. To prepare\nthe data for the hybrid model, sequences are constructed to capture temporal dynamics. Let Xt represent\nthe observed variables at time t, and the input sequence for the model is defined as:\nXinput = {Xt-k, Xt\u2212k+1,..., Xt\u22121}\nwhere k is the sequence length, representing the historical context that informs the prediction at time t.\nEach sequence is normalized to stabilize numerical computations and ensure consistency across variables,\npreventing scale disparities from impacting model performance. This step is essential to ensure that\ndifferent units of measurement (e.g., temperature in Celsius, wind speed in km/h) do not introduce bias in\nthe learning process.\nIn future, we could enhance this data with derived features Ft, such as moving averages, standard\ndeviations, and variability metrics, which can be calculated to enrich the dataset. For instance, a moving\naverage smooths trends over a defined window, while the standard deviation measures variability in the\ndata. These derived features provide complementary information that aligns with the strengths of\nXGBoost, which excels in handling tabular data and performing feature importance analysis. However,\nincorporating these features is beyond the scope of this study and is left as a direction for future work."}, {"title": "4.2 Result Evaluation", "content": "We have run all the three models on the same datasets with the past 7 days historical data as inputs to\nforecast the current day's temperature.

Fig. 2, 3, and 4 shows the learning curve, and value distribution charts of Transformer,\nXGBoost, and the proposed BTTF approach respectively."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "The results demonstrate the advantages of combining the Transformer's forecasting capabilities with\nXGBoost's adaptive decision-making strengths. The hybrid model shows strong performance across key\nmetrics. The results show it can overcome the limitations of standalone forecasting frameworks, which\noften struggle either to capture complex, non-linear relationships or to adapt dynamically in real time, as\nis the case with XGBoost used in isolation. It can continue to improve over more epochs without\noverfitting easily. The overall learning curves of BTTF on validation set is more stably decreasing\ncomparing to Transformer alone.\nAnother advantage of the BTTF model is its ability to seamlessly link prediction with present adaptation.\nIn domains such as meteorology, healthcare, or traffic management, it is insufficient to merely predict\nfuture conditions. Equally critical is the capacity to make informed decisions in the present based on these\nforecasts. The hybrid model addresses this need through its feedback loop, which alternates between\nforecasting future states and adapting present conditions. This ensures that decision-making is\ncontinuously informed by robust and dynamic predictions, offering a proactive approach that is\nparticularly advantageous in time-sensitive scenarios where early interventions can mitigate risks and\nimprove outcomes.\nXGBoost's feature importance ranking provides a layer of interpretability that is crucial for real-time\ndecision-making applications. By revealing the factors that contribute most significantly to the model's\npredictions and adaptations, stakeholders are better equipped to prioritize interventions and allocate\nresources effectively. This transparency not only enhances the usability of the model but also fosters trust\nin its outputs, which is essential in high-stakes environments such as healthcare and natural disaster\nresponse, where decisions have far-reaching consequences."}, {"title": "5.2 Explanation of the BTTF Performance", "content": "As for the deeper reason driving the better performance of BTTF, it can be attributed to its hybrid\narchitecture, which integrates the strengths of both Transformer-based models and tree-based models like\nXGBoost. Transformers excel at capturing complex dependencies and patterns in sequential or time-series\ndata through their self-attention mechanisms, enabling the model to learn complicated relationships across\nlong-term data. However, as the model's training increases, it often requires significantly more\ncomputational resources, and its learning becomes progressively slower. On the other hand, tree-based\nmodels like XGBoost are known for their ability to perform well with tabular data by efficiently handling\nstructured features and capturing non-linear relationships. By combining these two model types, BTTF\nleverages the powerful pattern recognition capabilities of Transformers while maintaining the efficiency\nand interpretability of XGBoost. This hybrid approach allows the model to both learn complex sequences\nand make robust, efficient predictions across different types of data, leading to better generalization,\nhigher predictive accuracy, and more reliable performance, especially when scaling to larger datasets and\nmore epochs.\nMeanwhile, BTTF's hybrid design offers an enhanced ability to adapt to varying data complexities. The\nTransformer component effectively captures intricate temporal or sequential patterns, making it well-\nsuited for data with long-range dependencies, while the XGBoost part can quickly handle tabular features\nwith minimal data preprocessing. By integrating these complementary strengths, BTTF avoids the\nweaknesses inherent in each model working alone. The Transformer alone can struggle with the need for\nvast computational resources when trained for long epochs, and XGBoost, although fast and efficient,\nmay not capture long-term dependencies as effectively. The future-visionary aspect of BTTF lies in its\nability to continually evolve and refine its predictions, allowing it to dynamically adjust to data trends\nover time. This fusion of capabilities creates a more versatile, robust model that can handle a wider range\nof prediction tasks with greater precision, making it better suited for complex, real-world applications."}, {"title": "5.3 Comparison with Other Forecasting Frameworks", "content": "Another popular framework for forecasting sophisticated situations is the \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT)[25]\nframework, which is based on sequential reasoning, where decision-making follows a step-by-step\nprocess. Each step in the reasoning chain builds on the previous one, ensuring that logical progression is\nmaintained throughout the task. This approach is particularly useful for complex problems that require\ndetailed, methodical reasoning and where every step needs to be explained in order, such as solving\nmathematical problems or writing essays. The CoT methodology emphasizes structured, ordered thinking,\nguiding the system through predefined steps in a coherent manner to reach conclusions.\nIn contrast, the BTTF methodology is explicitly designed for dynamic environments where conditions\nchange rapidly and immediate action is crucial. Unlike CoT, which focuses on long-term reasoning,\nBTTF bridges the gap between forecasting (predicting future events) and nowcasting (predicting\nimmediate conditions). This hybrid approach uses forecast outputs not only to gain insights into future\ntrends but also as critical inputs for real-time decisions. By combining these two functions, BTTF enables\na system to dynamically adapt to changing conditions, maintaining predictive accuracy while ensuring\nthat immediate actions can be taken in response to the evolving situation. This makes BTTF particularly\nvaluable in areas like meteorology, healthcare, and disaster response, where the need for real-time,\nadaptive decision-making is paramount."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents a BTTF approach demonstrating advancements over one-model-standalone\nforecasting and adaptation methods, as showcased in the weather forecasting experiment.

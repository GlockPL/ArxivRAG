The most commonly accepted method for answering this question-in fields across the behavioral and social sciences, decision theory, philosophy, and artificial intelligence development is simply to add up utilities associated with the different options and pick the solution with the largest sum. This \"utilitarian\" approach seems like the obvious, theory-neutral way of approaching the problem. But there is an important, though often-ignored, alternative: a \u201ccontractualist\" approach, which advocates for an agreement-driven method of deciding. Remarkably, no research has presented empirical evidence directly comparing the intuitive plausibility of these two approaches. In this paper, we systematically explore the proposals suggested by each algorithm (the \u201cUtilitarian Sum\" and the contractualist \"Nash Product\"), using a paradigm that applies those algorithms to aggregating preferences across groups in a social decision-making context. While the dominant approach to value aggregation up to now has been utilitarian, we find that people strongly prefer the aggregations recommended by the contractualist algorithm. Finally, we compare the judgments of large language models (LLMs) to that of our (human) participants, finding important misalignment between model and human preferences.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Imagine you lead a grant-making body answerable to groups of constituents with diverse needs and interests. How should you allocate your limited funds? Imagine you could give the money to a group of teachers who want to buy art supplies for their classrooms, a group of residents who want to organize a block party for the whole town, or a group of municipal workers looking for funds to help their colleagues unionize. One thing you might decide to do is allocate all the money to the group that makes the most compelling argument. In many cases, however, you would instead consider looking for some kind of compromise. You could allocate funds in proportion to the number of constituents in each group and the magnitude of their need-this could result in maximizing overall welfare. Or you could call the constituents together to discuss the issue-this could result in determining a solution that all the invested parties would agree to.\nThese are two prominent ways of thinking about compromise when faced with the challenge of value aggregation. How should limited resources be distributed when different people value different things? Two major schools of thought have competing proposals. The \u201cutilitarian\" approach advocates for simply adding up utilities associated with everyone's welfare and picking the solution with the largest sum (Equation 1). In contrast, a \u201ccontractualist\u201d approach advocates for an agreement-driven method of deciding. There are a range of contractualist proposals, but here we focus on one commonly used formulation: the Nash Product (Equation 2).\nDespite there being (at least) two theoretically-motivated approaches to the problem of value aggregation, in practice, research across fields from decision theory [203, 122], to AI [38, 8, 78, 184], to philosophy [118, 168, 179] have operated (often unreflectively) using the utilitarian approach."}, {"title": "Theoretical Foundations", "content": "The literature on aggregating preferences spans rational decision-theory [203, 122, 199], social choice theory [178], and voting theory [165]. These theoretical frameworks offer distinct perspectives on how individual preferences can be consolidated into collective decisions.\nRational decision-theory, as the basis of understanding individual preferences, posits that individuals, when faced with multiple options, will choose the one that maximizes their utility [203, 199, 99]. Social choice theory, as an extension of rational decision-theory, analyzes individual preferences in a society and how they can be aggregated to reflect a collective preference [178]. It focuses on the design of mechanisms for making collective decisions, namely social welfare functions (SWFs). SWFs rank decisions based on their desirability to some group. We therefore use the framework provided by SWFs as our guide in this paper. Another closely related line of work-voting theory- goes further to specifically addresses the methodology of preference aggregation in democratic decision-making processes, addressing concerns like strategic manipulation [165]; these issues are beyond the scope of the present work."}, {"title": "Aggregation Mechanisms", "content": "There are many SWFs one might use to aggregate views. We will focus on two of the most popular. First consider the utilitarian SWF, e.g. as identified by Von Neumann and Morgenstern [203], which we will term the \u201cUtilitarian Sum.\" Formally, this sums the utility of available choices based on the amount of support for each.\n$\\arg \\max_{c \\in C} \\sum_{\\alpha \\in A} u_\\alpha(c) \\times b_\\alpha$ \nThere are many ways in which the Utilitarian Sum is intuitively appealing. For instance, it uses logic similar to what we use for dealing with empirical uncertainty in a rational actor framework-simply do the action that leads to the best consequence taking into account how likely each consequence is and how good or bad it would be [28], equating degree of likelihood and belief.\nThe Utilitarian Sum also has important drawbacks. For instance, the Utilitarian Sum biases toward strong opinions of minority sub-groups\u2014an issue called fanatacism [83]. It also makes inter-theoretic comparisons: direct comparisons between the utilities of different groups which is difficult to justify a priori. Tarsney [193] critique various ways to make inter-theoretic comparisons, even though Harsanyi [86] argues for their necessity. The Utilitarian Sum has been widely studied for its use in preference aggregation (see below), particularly as it relates to empirical uncertainty [83].\nIn contrast, Kaneko and Nakamura [101] introduce the Nash Social Welfare Function which we will term the \"Nash Product.\" Formally, the solution to a Nash bargaining problem is to maximize the product of utilities [208]:"}, {"title": "Nash Product", "content": "$\\arg \\max_{c \\in C} \\prod_{\\alpha \\in A} u_\\alpha(c)^{b_\\alpha}$\nThe Nash Product is more conservative than fanatical. It trades-off maximizing aggregate benefit with capturing notions of fairness.\nAnother way to capture notions of fairness in a SWF is to use the Rawlsian lexical minimum, which maximizes the benefit to the least well off:\n$\\arg \\max_{c \\in C} \\min_{\\alpha \\in A} u_\\alpha(c) \\times b_\\alpha$\nIndeed, all three of equations 1, 2, and 3 are comparable. Moulin [139] shows that a parameterized piece-wise function, where $\\alpha$ tracks the degree of inequality aversion, results in the Nash Product when $\\alpha = 1$, the Utilitariam Sum when $\\alpha = 0$, and the lexical minimum when $\\alpha = \\infty$ [10]:\n$\\arg \\max_{c \\in C} \\begin{cases} \\sum_{\\alpha \\in A} (u_\\alpha (c) \\times b_\\alpha)^{1-\\alpha} & 0 \\leq \\alpha, \\alpha \\neq 1 \\\\ \\prod_{\\alpha \\in A} u_\\alpha(c)^{b_\\alpha} & \\alpha = 1 \\end{cases}$\nAs we discuss further below, while appealing for its privileging of egalitarianism, the Rawlsian minimum approach has important counter-intuitive implications [88, 152, 156, 23, 68]. The Nash Product has more inequality aversion than the Utilitarian sum (it is less fanatical) but not as much as the lexical minimum; it exhibits diminishing marginal returns as utility increases linearly. Our central experiments in this paper, therefore, compare intuitions about the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product.\nThese (and most other) SWFs assume that utilities are definable and known\u2014and this carries non-trivial assumptions. For example, in economics, one might simply use a fungible price as a utility while utilities of outcomes in voting theory are not fungible. Furthermore, people may use different value functions to make decisions. In our experiments, we included both non-fungible and fungible quantities. Mason [130] reviews some theoretical concerns of such assumptions."}, {"title": "Normative Approaches", "content": "How do we judge whether one aggregation mechanism is superior to another?\nBased on mathematical merits One approach examines the theoretical, mathematical trade-offs between SWFs, for instance by showing that in certain settings one SWF might not be mathematically optimal. There have been a number of such comparisons between the Nash Product and Utilitarian Sum-like approaches [160, 159, 158, 196]. More recent theoretical work on the Nash Product seeks to approximate it with mathematically analogous mechanisms [132, 27, 161]. Kimbrough and Vostroknutov [103] propose a number of game-theoretic heuristics (including the Nash Product) which people might use as a proxy to make moral choices. The contrast between the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product also connects to recent debates in economics between (respectively) additive and multiplicative accounts of value, that is, averaging via the arithmetic vs. the geometric mean [154].\nBased on intuition Another approach judges which aggregation mechanism better matches the authors' intuitions. Typically one examines isolated case-studies. For example, an author might claim that a SWF produces unintuitive results on a particular case study, using this as an argument for some other SWF. Mathematicians, particularly decision theorists, exercise a degree of aesthetic judgement, or intuition, in defining the axioms of SWFs [203, 89, 87]. For example, Luce and Raiffa [122] introduce a number of classic cooperative games to gain intuition about game theory.\nOne prominent normative disagreement between contractualist and utilitarian mechanisms arose between Rawls [163] arguing for a maximin account and Harsanyi [88] arguing for an expected value account. While both were operating under the assumption of a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d style judgement, each disagreed on the appropriate normative mechanism to use.\nSimilarly, Parfit [152] and Nagel [141] both use specific (but different) imagined scenarios to justify opposing views on equality, as more recent work on equality does as well [156].\nThe use of authors' intuitions to make normative claims about value aggregation is common in other sub-areas of moral philosophy as well. For example, this issue is central to debates about \u201cmoral uncertainty\", the puzzle of what to do if you believe different ethical theories to different extents [118, 179, 168]. Different philosophers marshal their intuitions to argue that ethical theories can"}, {"title": "The Empirical Approach", "content": "Behavioral Economics When people make decisions between multiple outcomes, what approaches do they use? Questions like this are the domain of behavioral economics. Many works examine which resource distributions people favor, finding some evidence for a preference for equal allocations [37, 53, 62].\nNoting the fanatacism of the Utilitarian Sum, Fehr and Schmidt [60, 61] introduce a formalism sensitive to inequality (Equation 5). Subsequent work [53, 62] has found support for an inequality aversion model over the Utilitarian Sum.\nWe consider such a model (an extension of Fehr and Schmidt [60]) that directly modifies the Utilitarian Sum to be sensitive to the degree of inequality in outcomes:\n$\\arg \\max_{c \\in C}(1 \u2013 \\alpha) (\\sum_{a \\in A} u_a(c) \\times b_a) - (\\frac{\\alpha}{2})( \\sum_{(a,a') \\in A, a \\neq a'} |u_a (c) \u2013 u_{a'} (c)|)$ \nThe first term is just Equation 1 while the second term captures the amount of inequality across groups. $\\alpha$ controls the degree of inequality aversion, with no aversion when $\\alpha = 0$ and increasing aversion otherwise.\nOther work in behavioral economics focuses on the Nash Product, studying the effect of the disagreement point [22], characterizing different bargaining strategies [107], and framing the Nash Product as a trade-off between utility or money [14]. In practice, Yao and Wang [206] find that in a certain modeling problem the Nash Product better fits the data than a Utilitarian approach, although they do not probe human intuitions directly.\nEmpirical Philosophy Moral philosophers have increasingly used empirical inquiry to validate individual philosophers' intuitions with the opinions of the crowd, making thought-experiments into real experiments, such as those about distributive justice [67]. Bruner [23], for example, finds that when presented with a variety of scenarios of different resource distributions, participants prefer a strictly Utilitarian approach as compared to the Rawlsian minimum-participants maximize total utility not the utility for the least advantaged member (Equation 3). Frohlich et al. [68] present a similar result.\nSimilarly, Bauer et al. [12] study how various traits of agents change how much of a given resource participants distribute (though they do not focus on Utilitarian Sum or Nash Product in particular)."}, {"title": "Utilitarian Sum vs. Nash Product", "content": "To our knowledge, the only study to empirically examine participants' responses regarding the Utilitarian Sum and Nash Product is Binmore et al. [15].

Building on their finding we ask a more direct question: which aggregation mechanism best accords with people's intuitions?"}, {"title": "Studies", "content": "Which method of aggregating preferences, of arriving at a compromise for a distribution of resources, is judged to be better-the Utilitarian Sum or the Nash Product?"}, {"title": "Scenario generation", "content": "To study this, we generated scenarios where the Nash Product and the Utilitarian Sum disagree on the best way to aggregate value and designed an experiment with novel visual aids in which human and LLM participants judged which compromise was best (see Fig. 1). Our paradigm also allows us to test the predictions of the Rawlsian Minimum (Equation 3) and Inequality Sum (Equation 5).\nUnlike the focus on isolated cases of prior work, we systematically canvas the space of possible simple value aggregation problems, testing a broad and representative set that distinguish the predictions of the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product mechanisms.\nWe asked subjects to imagine that their local health department was looking for feedback on how various proposals would affect the community. Then we asked participants to choose which of three proposals was the \"best compromise.\" Each scenario involved a different outcome for each of three groups across each of three proposals (Fig. 1). These proposals would either decrease the average number of days to wait for an appointment, decrease the number of minutes to travel for an appointment, increase the years to live, or decrease the cost of a medical visit. We deliberately chose outcomes which were not always fungible monetary values in order to control for the effect of the kind of utility on the decision outcome. All scenarios were set up so that higher outcomes were more desirable, and thus the best outcomes-as predicted by the Utilitarian Sum or the Nash Product-maximized these measures.\nWe generated two different sets of scenarios: Focused and Random. For the \u201cFocused\u201d set, we generated scenarios that described three groups of constituents with equal bargaining power (i.e., number of people) deciding between three choices (proposals) whose outcomes laid in {1, 51, 101}. Out of 19657 total scenarios meeting these conditions ((33)3 minus duplicates), 162 (.8%) resulted in a disagreement between the Utilitarian Sum and Nash Product. The \"Random\" set was constructed in the same way but included outcomes randomly sampled from the whole range [1,101] (e.g. {1, 17,90}, {5, 53, 48}, . . .). In this set, the Nash Product and Utilitarian Sum disagreed about 17% of the time (see Table 6).\nParticipants were presented with some scenarios where the Nash Product and the Utilitarian Sum disagree on which of the three policy choices would be superior as well as scenarios where the two aggregation mechanisms agree on which policy is best-the latter acting as a control condition."}, {"title": "Study 1: Human Participants", "content": "Each scenario (Fig. 1) asked participants which of three proposals they thought was the \"best compromise\" between the groups.

This allows for precision in differentiating between the mechanisms, but comes with the challenge of overwhelming participants with numerical information. We therefore developed a series of visual aids intended to assist participants in understanding the scenarios [39]. This strategy has been fruitfully applied in prior psychological research.Tversky [199] showed pie-charts instead"}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Throughout, we will focus on two different groups of scenarios: those in which the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product disagree on which proposal is best (Disagreement Cases) and those in in which they agree (Agreement Cases).

In the Disagreement Cases, we report the percent of participants that select the response endorsed by each of the Utilitarian Sum and Nash Product. (See the SI \u00a7 \u201cStudy 1\u201d for our survey qualification task.)\nOur central finding is that in the Disagreement Cases, respondents overwhelmingly supported the Nash Product (see Fig. 2A). In the Focused scenarios for all four conditions (Area Charts, Volume Charts, Both Charts, and No Charts) participants favored the Nash Product over random chance (Binomial test, p < .001) (see Fig. 3A). We saw the same trend with the Random scenarios (See SI Fig. A.1-2 for details).\nIn the Agreement Cases, the majority of respondents across all conditions chose the correct answer (the answer both the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product agreed on; see Fig. 4A), confirming that participants understood the task and responded as expected to it. Notably, in the No Charts condition, performance dropped (though still was an improvement over chance), emphasizing the importance of the visual aids we provided. (Details in Fig. 3A and Fig. 4A for the Focused scenarios and SI Fig. A.1. for the Random scenarios.)\nWe also compared the Nash Product with the Inequality Sum (Eq. 5), a variant of the Utilitarian Sum with an added term to account for inequality aversion. The Inequality Sum can weight inequality aversion to different extents, depending on the setting of its free parameter (a in Eq. 5). Fig. 5 demonstrates that across the entire range of parameter settings for the Inequality Sum, participants strongly preferred the proposal suggested by the Nash Product when it disagreed with the Inequality Sum (Fig. 5).\nFinally, we compared predictions of the Nash Product with those of the Rawls Minimum (Eq. 3), and likewise find strong preference for the Nash Product (see SI Fig. A.3)."}, {"title": "Study 2: LLM participants", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are already used for variety of human cognitive tasks [209] and, increasingly, in value aggregation tasks [98].

[41] specifically argue that aggregation mechanisms like those we explore in this paper may be a better choice for the purposes of aligning AI systems. Because of these trends, we sought to answer: Can any LLM serve as a model of preference aggregation? Could LLMs be used as decision aides? To answer these questions, we replicated our human study with LLMs.\nGiven the current limitations of multimodal models [207], we restricted our analysis to language-only models. To as much as possible equate the experience of the LLM participants to that of our human participants (who were provided with visual aids in some conditions), we textually described the algorithmic steps of either the Nash Product (for the volume chart case), the Utilitarian Sum (for the area chart case), both, or neither (see SI Fig. A.13-14)."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "Here we report the results of the most performant model, gpt-4-0613.

This trend reversed for the Random scenarios in which gpt-4 aligned with both the Nash Product and Utilitarian Sum more than chance in all conditions (p < .001; see SI Fig. A.1). claude-3 showed similar performance to gpt-4 but all smaller models showed even less alignment (see SI Fig. A.4-5)."}, {"title": "Study 3: Prevalence", "content": "How often do disagreements between the Utilitarian Sum and the Nash Product arise in real preference-aggregation problems?

In other words, which algorithm yields more intuitively plausible compromises, the Utilitarian Sum (an additive view) or the contractualist Nash Product (a multiplicative view)? Our evidence shows that in cases in which the two mechanisms disagree, people overwhelmingly support the Nash Product, contrary to the current default assumption to use the Utilitarian Sum when values must be aggregated [123, 83, 184, 203].\nIn the No Chart condition, when participants were presented with value aggregation problems involving raw numbers alone, they weakly favored the Nash Product over the Utilitarian Sum. However, when provided with either an area-based or volume-based visual aid, their preference for the Nash Product became even more pronounced (Fig. 2). This was particularly striking given that the visual aids were designed to represent (and thus bias toward) the calculations behind each of the aggregation mechanisms (the volume representation visualizing the Nash Product and the area representation visualizing the Utilitarian Sum).\nFurthermore, in Agreement Cases, participants without a visual aid had weak or no significant alignment with both the Nash Product and Utilitarian Sum while participants significantly aligned with both mechanisms when provided a visual aid (Fig. 4), underscoring the importance of the visual aids in getting clear, meaningful data to differentiate these views.\nThe Nash Product also appears to be preferred over other main algorithmic candidates for value aggregation, the Inequality Sum and the Rawlsian Minimum. In the case of the former, participants preferred the proposal favored by the Nash Product over that of the Inequality Sum for the full range of inequality-aversion parameters possible (Fig 5). The only parameterization where the Inequality Sum was equally as endorsed as the Nash Product was the one that produced no disagreements with the Nash Product. Nonetheless, future work should explore additional ways of differentiating between the two mechanisms, for example by varying group sizes or by simply by focusing more narrowly on testing cases where the parameterizations of the Inequality Sum are most similar to the Nash Product.\nRecently, scholars have begun to turn to contractualist accounts to explain the workings of the moral mind. Andr\u00e9 et al. [6] make an evolutionary argument that long-term concerns about an agent's social reputation explain the use of something like the Nash Product to ground and guide morality (see also, work by Bruner [24]). Levine et al. [112] argue, using a resource-rationality framework, that imagined approximations of a contractualist ideal (such as the one defined by the Nash Product) are pervasive in human moral thinking. Our findings corroborate these lines of work, providing empirical evidence that our participants have contractualist intuitions about the best way to solve value aggregation problems. At the same time, however, we do not necessarily anticipate that participants are doing a complex multiplication problem in their heads to solve the value aggregation task we set in front of them. It therefore remains an open question what algorithmic cognitive mechanisms allow participants to solve this task in line with the predictions of the Nash Product. (We explore a range of approaches in SI \u00a7 \u201cFormalizing Contractualism.\u201d)\nAs AI systems such as LLMs are increasingly deployed in value-laden decision making settings [98, 41] and even to find compromises [10], it is important to understand whether the aggregation mechanisms AI systems use align with the mechanisms people intuitively prefer. So: Can any LLM serve as a model of preference aggregation? Performant LLMs such as gpt-4 sometimes display a similar preference to our human participants for the Nash Product over the Utilitarian Sum-they do model aspects of human preference aggregation. Indeed, models including gpt-4 display systematically different biases in even slightly less constrained cases, calling into question their degree of alignment with human intuitions. Smaller and less capable models we studied diverged even farther from the behavior of our human participants, performing closer to chance across conditions (SI Fig. A.5). The performance of gpt-4 suggests that more capable LLMs may be able to serve as cognitive models of value aggregation or used as compromise aides themselves, although further"}, {"title": "Limitations & Future Work", "content": "Our studies compare one contractualist method of preference aggregation (the Nash Product) with the Utilitarian Sum (the canonical consequentialist method of aggregation). However, contractualism comes in many forms and future work should explore whether formalizations of other contractualist mechanisms may capture people's intuitions better than the Nash Product or (perhaps most likely), whether different mechanisms capture intuitions in different circumstances. Future work along these lines might aim to harness a parliamentary structure or the turn-taking nature of negotiation (perhaps using some sort of sequential decision making approach), which capture the spirit of contractualism and bargaining towards agreements. (See SI \u00a7 \u201cFormalizing Contractualism\" for a description of some attempts to do so.)\nOur approach focuses on scenarios with fully-specified outcomes, group sizes, and a discrete number of available actions. In our prevalence analysis (Study 3), we show that these conditions are indeed sometimes met in real world cases that call for value aggregation. However, the majority of cases where value aggregation is required will not have such information available. A rich line of future work would involve explorations on how to weaken some of these constraints and assumptions. For example, systems might begin with natural-language scenarios and decompose into the formal models which we describe. Alternatively, one might attempt to replicate this work in an ordinal as opposed to cardinal setting.\nMoreover, we surveyed only U.S.-based, adult participants and thus may have detected preferences that are constrained to that particular group. Future work should explore individual and cultural differences in preference aggregation strategies to track the emergence and universality of the results we find here.\nWhile in this paper we have focused on aggregating preferences between groups, the underlying formal mechanisms (but not necessarily the assumptions) are equivalent when aggregating between preferences within an individual. Consider: You sit down for dinner pining for a burger but torn up about animal welfare. What should you eat? In such cases, philosophers have asked what strategies a person should use when deciding between various normative theories [118, 123, 83], though quantitatively-precise investigations into this question from a descriptive perspective are just beginning [112, 125, 197]. The methods we develop in this paper could be a fruitful approach to study what kind of mechanisms the mind uses to choose which moral mechanism to use when."}, {"title": "Data Archival", "content": "All data and code to run these experiments are available on Github. https://github.com/ jlcmoore/valueaggregation"}, {"title": "Formalizing Contractualism", "content": "What is the best way to aggregate value? Below we survey a range of algorithmic implementations of contractualist (agreement-based or negotiation-based) answers to this question.\nNash Product The Nash Product has long been used to model bargaining; it was initially introduced as the Nash Bargaining Solution [145, 101]. It allows for comparison between different choices available to multiple parties wherein each party to the bargain also has the option to choose not to bargain and instead choose what is called the disagreement point (the status quo or outside option). No verbal negotiation goes on between the parties. The Nash Bargaining Solution is simply the choice which maximizes the product of each party's gains over the status quo-the choice which maximizes cooperation between the parties to the negotiation. For this reason, following other scholars, we contend that the Nash Product provides a contractualist [6, 112] account of value aggregation-one built around agreement.\nThis is in contrast to the dominant consequentialist approach of the Utilitarian Sum. Indeed, we began this work as an attempt to question some of the assumptions that the Utilitarian Sum makes, namely that it engages in intertheoretic comparisons, it equates individuals utilities, and it is prone to fanaticism, it can be swayed by strong opinions of minority groups. The Nash Product is not as susceptible to fanaticism as the Utilitarian sum but it fundamentally makes intertheoretic comparisons on the Pareto frontier. Furthermore, as noted above, the Nash Product formally requires the specification of a disagreement point, or outside option [83]. Often the Nash Product is used on utilities greater than or equal to one (lest the product become infinitesimal) and so requires a structural transformation to a different range, usually, e.g. [1,\u221e)\u2014a similar structural transformation as is suggested for the Utilitarian Sum.\nThe Nash Product depends on the utility gains in a way that Utilitarian Sum does not. Thus what counts as a gain is contingent on what each agent's outside option or disagreement point is. The disagreement point is what happens if no majority is reached-often either a utility of zero, some extreme value, or the outcomes of some other default strategy. Define the disagreement point, d\u2208 RIA such that the outcome of the disagreement point is also an available utility for each agent, U U {d} [83]. Still, we do not find the specification of a disagreement point as a significant assumption. How often is it the case that a decision has specified all of the utilities for the potential proposals or actions but does not have a specified disagreement point? Fundamentally, assessing the utilities of actions is not that different from assigning utilities for a disagreement point (a sort of null action).\nNonetheless, it is possible to circumvent this issue by stipulating utilities at the disagreement point (or stipulating the change in utilities from the disagreement point for every action available in the set). This is what we do in our studies.\nStill, there are a variety of other formal approaches one might take to contractualism."}, {"title": "Turn-Taking Games", "content": "One approach is to model a bargain as an extensive, turn-taking game like chess. This has the benefit of avoiding any intertheoretic comparison: each group imagines their best choice given the choice of every other group in which groups have different voting power-similar to a parliament. In order to encourage coalitions in such a game, Newberry and Ord [146] suggest setting the utility of a choice in proportion to the weights each vote receives (groups by group weight) but then choosing the best option by majority vote. They call their approach \u201cproportional chances.\u201d For a two player game assume some voting mechanism (social welfare function), F, which operates over the outcomes, U, group beliefs, B, and choices, C, where ci \u2208 {0, 1}, 1 if group i chose that choice and 0 otherwise and u(c) is the vector of U for choice c. Fpc is the function for proportional chances.\n$F_{pc} = \\max_{c \\in C} (u(c) \\frac{c_a \\times b_a}{C_a})$\nWhat becomes apparent is that taking the proportion is not strictly necessary for each player to incorporate the others' actions. It can also cause free-riding. Consider an example which we have set up to appear like an intuitive opportunity for negotiation to occur. A plurality group, \u201ca\u201d has the highest voting power and prefers an option much dispreferred by the two minority groups. Each minority group, \"b\" and \"c\" prefers an option dispreferred by the rest, \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d respectively. The minority groups want choice \u201c4\u201d second-best. They should collaborate to vote for this option. All of the terms in ba > bb, bc, are greater than zero, and uc,\u044c(4) < uc(3), u\u2081(2).\nNevertheless, when cast as a proportional chances game, no cooperation emerges here because either of the minority groups can free ride off of the others' vote for the second-best option and still vote for their preferred option (at least as they see it in the game tree). For example, consider whether \u201cb\u201d chooses to vote for \u201c2\u201d or \u201c4\u201d given that \"a\" votes for \"1\" and \"c\" attempts to bargain by voting for \u201c4\u201d; the utility of the former will always dominate the utility of the latter.\nbaua(1) + b\u044cub (2) + bcuc(4) > baua(1) + \u0431\u044c\u0438\u044c(4) + bcuc(4)\n\u0431\u044c\u0438\u044c (2) > \u0431\u044c\u0438\u044c (4) + bc\nStill, many other voting mechanisms, F, might be used. If the strict majority vote is used, it will fail to give answers when only a plurality is reached; it will not be complete. Instead, terminal utilities can simply be the players' respective outcomes for what would happen if each player voted a certain way, using the weighted majority vote. Call this approach the maximax disagreement (mmd), Fmmd\n$F_{mmd} = \\begin{cases} \\max_{c \\in c} \\sum_{a \\in A} C_a \\times b_a < .5\\\\ fo lu (\\sum_{a \\in A} C_a \\times b_a) & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$"}, {"title": "Strategic Games", "content": "More promising would be a strategic, non turn-taking, equilibrium selection approach [89]. Unfortunately, these are notoriously complicated and case specific. For example, neither of the outcome (utility) vectors (1, 10, 100) nor (100, 100, 1) Pareto-dominates the other. Nonetheless, it seems obvious that the second is preferred. What about (1,51, 10) compared to (1, 10, 51) or (1,51, 10, 10) compared to (9, 2, 52, 9)?

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The regular emergence of novel cybersecurity threats necessitates that organizations continuously adapt their security strategies to have an effective & efficient enterprise cybersecurity system. Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM) systems have emerged as critical components for securing the enterprise systems. Typically, legacy IAM systems facilitated the definition and implementation of access control policies, determining authorized users, specific resource access, temporal restrictions, and contextual conditions. However, these traditional IAM solutions often fail to address modern requirements such as distributed and open Customer identities, scalability, password-less authentication, Al-driven monitoring, and zero-trust security models required for globally distributed systems.\nThe proposed framework leverages adaptive authentication, identity federation, Al-powered continuous session risk analysis, and integrated privileged access management system. Departing from traditional perimeter-based security policies, this architecture adopts a Zero Trust framework, enabling granular access control, real-time session monitoring, and adaptive policy enforcement. While traditional systems are constrained by static access control policies and a hierarchical access framework, this architecture enhances resilience through decentralized authorization and dynamically adapts access privileges contingent on contextual risk factors.\nKey innovations of this framework include enhanced encryption standards, pseudonymized data sharing, federated identity management, and advanced behavioral analytics. These innovations support distributed network environments and multi-platform integration while adhering to compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2. Additionally, the CHEZ PL CIAM-PAM model provides seamless interoperability with legacy systems due to underlying microservices design, facilitating enterprises to upgrade CIAM systems without causing major disruptions to existing workflows.\nFurthermore, CHEZ PL integrates AI-driven anomaly detection for privileged access, session monitoring, and proactive risk assessments. It also employs real-time auditing tools that simplify compliance reporting and reduce overheads associated with manual audits. This research also investigates the efficacy of the proposed architecture in mitigating challenges related to scalability, interoperability across diverse platforms, and adherence to regulatory compliance standards, while also establishing a future-proof framework readily adaptable to emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Generative AI (GenAI) technologies.\nThis paper concludes with a discussion on future extensions of this research paradigm, limitations of adopting CHEZ PL CIAM-PAM architecture and implications for Cybersecurity managers in large multi-national organizations."}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "The paradigm of IAM systems has been changing over the last decade with more requirements of integrating external Customer identities, provide privileged access and demands of enhancing the monitoring & reporting. Historically, IAM architectures tend to be either role-based access control (RBAC) model, attribute-based access control model, mandatory access control model or discretionary access control model (Nahar & Gill 2022). But latent research (Yang et al 2014, Mohammed et al 2018, Nahar & Gill 2022) found that RBAC based architectures are most efficient for large scale organizations. Furthermore, these traditional IAM systems primarily relied on access control processes based on static roles and organizational hierarchies. The proliferation of cloud computing and geographically distributed customer populations, multiple open-source identities, active persistent cyber threats, etc. revealed limitations in existing architectures, highlighting the need for more dynamic, scalable, and adaptive solutions. Zero Trust architecture design, initially popularized by Forrester Research, has become a cornerstone of latest Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems (Turner et al 2021).\nBesides, Zero-trust implications, IAM policies need to adapt to the emerging trend of multi-identity dynamics & data privacy compliance rules for external users, including open identities, state-sponsored identities, social media identities, other trusted third-party identities (Peterson et al 2008, Roy 2023, Gl\u00f6ckler et al 2024). To address this challenge, federated identity models are increasingly utilized in contemporary deployments of CIAM to optimize authentication workflows across hybrid and multi-cloud environments (Malik et al 2015, P\u00f6hn & Hommel 2020, Kiourtis et al 2023). The resulting federated identity systems centralize identity verification, alleviating the need for users to manage disparate credentials, thus enhancing both usability and security. Standards such as SAML (Hughes & Maler 2005), OAuth 2.0 (Fett et al 2016), and OpenID Connect (Mainka et al 2017) also significantly facilitated the interoperability between CIAM and PAM solutions across heterogeneous platforms (Walker 2019).\nOther scholars have proposed to enhance existing IAM systems by incorporating password-less authentication (Alqubaisi et al 2020), AI-driven identity governance (Azhar 2016, Hawa 2024), risk-based access control models (Atlam et al 2020). Furthermore, the advancements in AI are also impacting our understanding of IAM systems, especially for automation and control. Many studies have postulated different methodologies to incorporate IA into IAM architectures to - authentication, authorization, and auditing (Aboukadri et al 2024, Vegas & Lamas 2024, Ahmadian et al 2014).\nIncorporating all these different paradigms into one holistic architecture is crucial research gap and requires deep knowledge of cybersecurity architectures as well as Al systems design. This paper takes this challenge to bring all these state-of the-art technologies into CIAM architecture. This CHEZ PL CIAM-PAM architecture advances beyond this prior work by implementing a synergistic integration of Zero Trust principles and AI- driven threat detection, specifically designed to overcome scalability and compliance obstacles prevalent in large- scale enterprise environments It incorporates pseudonymized data models and compliance mechanisms for GDPR and HIPAA, ensuring regulatory alignment. Furthermore, it extends prior work by addressing integration challenges with legacy systems, providing backward compatibility, and enabling gradual migration strategies, in turn reducing overall project costs.\nThis paper extends prior work by offering a comprehensive, modular framework designed specifically for large-scale enterprises operating in geographically distributed networks. This architecture emphasizes interoperability with legacy systems while integrating adaptive authentication, AI-driven analytics, and policy enforcement mechanisms to effectively mitigate emerging cybersecurity threats and minimize technical debt. It highlights the practical application of federated identities and pseudonymized data models, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards across multiple jurisdictions. Finally, the framework leverages AI-driven monitoring for continuous improvements, adaptive threat response, and risk mitigation strategies."}, {"title": "III.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Urban navigation has become increasingly challenging due to the unpredictable nature of traffic patterns and weather conditions. In rapidly growing cities, both public and private transportation systems are often hindered by congestion, road closures, and sudden changes in weather, leading to inefficiencies in travel time and overall urban mobility. This challenge is compounded by the need for real-time solutions that can dynamically adapt to changing conditions, ensuring safe and efficient routes. Addressing these complexities is crucial for improving urban mobility, public transportation, and emergency response systems [1].\nTraditional algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra, while powerful in static or semi-dynamic environments, are limited by their inability to adapt to the continuous and unpredictable changes found in real-world urban settings [2]. These algorithms excel at optimizing predefined routes but lack flexibility to respond to dynamic variables like traffic congestion or adverse weather conditions in real time. As cities grow and become more complex, this inability to adjust routes based on real-time data leads to inefficient pathfinding that cannot cope with the demands of modern urban environments [3].\nTo address this limitation, researchers have explored incorporating contextual data into heuristic functions, adapting algorithms like A* to account for real-time conditions [4]. By using live traffic and weather data, these modified algorithms dynamically adjust their heuristic functions, offering routes that are both safer and more efficient. This approach enhances the adaptability of pathfinding systems, allowing them to make decisions based on current conditions. However, while this method improves performance, it still relies on predefined rules and lacks the ability to learn from historical patterns or predict future conditions, which limits its effectiveness in highly volatile environments [5].\nIn this research, we propose converting the pathfinding optimization problem from a heuristic-based approach to one driven by deep learning. By leveraging neural networks and using real-time and historical data, we enable the model to predict the next optimal edge to traverse. This shift allows for a more robust and adaptable approach, where deep learning models can capture complex relationships between traffic flow, weather conditions, and other contextual factors. Our contribution lies in the development of models such as MLP, GRU, LSTM, Autoencoders, and Transformers, which have been extensively benchmarked to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional methods in reducing travel times and improving pathfinding efficiency in dynamic urban environments [6], [7].\nThis paper makes the following key contributions:\n1) Deep learning-based pathfinding: We introduce a novel approach that transforms the traditional heuristic-based pathfinding problem into a deep learning task. By implementing and benchmarking several deep learning models-MLP, GRU LSTM, Autoencoders, and Transformers-we demonstrate the ability to predict the next optimal path segment in real time, outperforming traditional methods in dynamic urban environments.\n2) Enhanced A* algorithm: We develop an improved version of the A* algorithm that integrates real-time traffic and weather data, dynamically adjusting its heuristic function to optimize routes.\n3) Extensive benchmarking: We conduct a comprehensive experimental comparison between traditional algorithms and various deep learning models, quantifying their"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "Pathfinding in urban environments has been an active area of research for decades, with traditional algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's well-established for route optimization. These algorithms have demonstrated high efficiency in static or semi-dynamic environments where road layouts and traffic conditions remain relatively constant or change at predictable intervals. For example, A*'s heuristic-based approach has proven effective in applications like GPS navigation for minimizing travel time and distance in steady-state scenarios [8]. However, these algorithms are less effective in highly dynamic urban settings where factors such as traffic congestion and weather variability are critical. In these environments, the static nature of A* and Dijkstra's fails to accommodate frequent fluctuations in road conditions, limiting their applicability to real-world urban navigation.\nTo address this, several studies have introduced real-time data-driven adaptations of traditional algorithms. Enhanced versions of A* and Dijkstra's have been developed to incorporate live traffic data, road closures, and other situational inputs, yielding improvements in route flexibility and travel time. For instance, these modifications dynamically adjust heuristic functions based on current traffic density, allowing the algorithm to respond to congestion in real-time [9]. Results from these studies indicate that integrating real-time data can improve route efficiency by up to 20% in high-density traffic scenarios, although these algorithms still depend on predefined rules and heuristic tuning, which reduces their flexibility in unpredictable conditions [3].\nRecent advancements in machine learning, particularly neural networks, have introduced more adaptive techniques for traffic flow forecasting, enabling models to process both historical and real-time data for improved accuracy. Studies like [10] demonstrate that using neural networks to predict traffic patterns can enhance congestion mitigation by up to 15% over static pathfinding methods, as these models are trained to adapt to real-world variability by learning from past traffic data. However, most work in this area has concentrated on traffic prediction alone rather than applying neural networks within the actual pathfinding algorithm [6]. As a result, while these models excel at forecasting conditions, their integration into end-to-end route optimization systems remains limited.\nFurther research has explored the application of deep learning architectures specifically within urban traffic contexts. For example, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have been employed for simple predictive tasks, such as estimating travel time, yet their limitations in sequence learning reduce their effectiveness for complex, dynamic routing. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies essential for traffic prediction. Empirical studies reveal that GRUs, by virtue of their streamlined structure, achieve computational efficiency gains of up to 30% over LSTMs, making them suitable for real-time processing in pathfinding tasks [11], [12]. However, the sequential processing required by both LSTMs and GRUs still results in slower training times, particularly when applied to extensive, real-time urban networks.\nAutoencoders represent another significant approach, excelling in dimensionality reduction and feature extraction by learning compressed representations of complex traffic and weather data. Studies demonstrate that by condensing high-dimensional inputs, autoencoders enable more effective anomaly detection and forecasting for variables such as traffic flow and road obstructions, with accuracy improvements of around 10% for downstream routing tasks [13]. Transformers, meanwhile, have emerged as a transformative model for sequence-based data due to their attention mechanisms, which allow them to manage long-range dependencies efficiently without sequential constraints. Recent work has shown that Transformers outperform RNN-based models in predictive accuracy and processing time, making them increasingly popular for large-scale pathfinding applications where real-time adaptability is crucial [14].\nIn this work, we extend upon these previous efforts by applying MLP, LSTM, Autoencoders, and Transformers not only for prediction but for direct integration into the pathfinding process. By benchmarking each model's ability to predict the optimal path segments under various conditions, we evaluate their efficacy in real-time urban navigation. Unlike prior research that has largely focused on traffic prediction alone, our study provides a more holistic and adaptable pathfinding solution for navigating complex and constantly evolving urban environments [15]."}, {"title": "III.

Challenges with Traditional Pathfinding Methods", "content": "The primary limitation of traditional pathfinding methods is their reliance on static or precomputed data. While algorithms like A* use heuristic functions to guide the search process, they are not equipped to handle real-time contextual changes in the environment. For example, a precomputed route might become suboptimal or even dangerous if sudden weather changes or unexpected road closures occur. Moreover, these algorithms do not have the ability to predict how these factors will evolve over time, limiting their effectiveness in real-world urban applications [4]."}, {"title": "B.

We seek allocations that are simultaneously fair with respect to the subjective valuations and with respect to the market valuation.\nWe show that an allocation that satisfies stochastically-dominant envy-freeness up to one good (SD-EF1) with respect to both the subjective valuations and the market valuation does not always exist, but the weaker guarantee of EF1 with respect to the subjective valuations along with SD-EF1 with respect to the market valuation can be guaranteed. We also study a number of other guarantees such as Pareto optimality, EFX, and MMS. In addition, we explore non-additive valuations and extend our model to cake-cutting. Along the way, we identify several tantalizing open questions.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "For centuries, human civilizations have pondered how to settle disputes centered around division of goods. Such resolution requirements come up often in cases such as divorce settlement and estate division (in the absence of a will). A common practice in the real world is not to liquidate all the goods but to assess their fair market value (FMV) and create an \u201cequal division\u201d whereby the total fair market value of the goods awarded to each party is (almost) equal. Such a division is sometimes even a legal requirement [25]. For instance, fair market values of land\u2014as determined by assessors [26]-are often used to settle land disputes [35]. However, an FMV-based approach has two limitations: (i) parties may disagree on what the fair market value of a good is, and (ii) parties may have personal (i.e., subjective) cardinal preferences (over the goods) which may be quite different from the assessed market values.\nStarting with the seminal work of Steinhaus [36], the mathematical theory of fair division has made significant advances over the last century. The theory systematically addresses the issue (ii) mentioned above by developing models wherein the participating agents (parties) can submit their own heterogeneous valuations over the goods. Here, the underlying goal is to find a division that each agent would consider fair according to their own valuation. Hence, the models provide a systematic way to avoid disagreements. In recent years, fair division literature has made impressive strides in the context of indivisible goods, resulting in allocation methods that achieve appealing fairness guarantees. One such notion is envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), which demands that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own if we hypothetically exclude just one good from the envied agent's allocation [28, 13, 14].\nDespite the mathematical and conceptual appeal of this framework, equal division of goods under market values still holds unshakable importance in real-world dispute resolutions. Hence, we study the framework of fair division with market values, where we seek an allocation of the goods that the agents find fair with respect to their heterogeneous personal preferences (\u201csubjective utilities\"), and that is also a near-equal division under the market values. Formally, a set $M$ of (indivisible) goods must be allocated among a set $N$ of $n$ agents. Each agent $i \\in N$ submits an additive subjective utility function $u_i : 2^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ and there is an additive market value function $v : 2^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$. Our goal\""}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "An instance of fair division with market values is a quadruple, $(N, M, v, \\tilde{u} = (u_i)_{i \\in N})$, where $N$ is a set of $n$ agents, $M$ is a set of $m$ indivisible goods, $v : 2^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is a monotone set function indicating the market valuation of the goods, and $u_i : 2^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is the (subjective) monotone utility function of agent $i \\in N$. In particular, $u_i(S)$ and $v(S)$ denote agent $i$'s value and the market value for subset of goods $S \\subseteq M$, respectively. Throughout most of the paper, we consider market valuation $v$ and utilities $\\tilde{u}$ that are additive: recall that a set function $f : 2^M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is additive if $f(S) = \\sum_{r \\in S} f({r})$ for all $S \\subseteq M$. Section 4.3, in particular, goes beyond additive utilities and considers general, monotone ones.

For an instance $(N, M, v, (u_i)_{i \\in N})$, we say that an allocation $A = (A_1,..., A_n)$ is envy-free up to one good (EF1) with respect to subjective utilities if, for every pair of agents $i, j \\in N$, either $A_j = \\emptyset$ or $u_i(A_i) \\geq u_i(A_j \\setminus \\{g\\})$ for some good $g \\in A_j$. In addition, we say that $A$ is EF1 with respect to market values if the above-mentioned inequalities hold with $u_i$ replaced by $v$.\nNext, we define a strengthening, SD-EF1, based on the stochastic dominance (SD) relation.\nDefinition 2 (SD-preference [10]). For $X, Y \\subseteq M$, we say that agent $i$ SD-prefers $X$ to $Y$, denoted $X \\succ_i^{SD} Y$, if, for each good $g \\in M$, it holds that $|\\{g' \\in X : u_i(g') \\geq u_i(g)\\}| > |\\{g' \\in Y : u_i(g') \\geq u_i(g)\\}|$. That is, for each $g$, the subset $X$ has at least as many goods with utility (to agent $i$) at least as much as $g$ as $Y$ does. Also, we define SD-preference under the market valuation, denoted $X \\succ^{SD} Y$, by replacing $u_i$ with $v$.\nDefinition 3 (SD-EF1 [4]). An allocation $A = (A_1, ..., A_n)$ is said to be SD-envy-free up to one good (SD-EF1) if, for every pair of agents $i, j \\in N$, either $A_i = \\emptyset$ or $A_i \\succ_i^{SD} A_j \\setminus \\{g\\}$ for some good $g \\in A_j$.\nWe will say that an additive function $u : M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ induces a ranking (with ties) $\\pi : M \\rightarrow [|M|]$ if $\\pi$ ranks the goods in decreasing order of $u$, i.e., $\\pi(g) \\leq \\pi(g')$ iff $u(g) \\geq u(g')$ for all $g, g' \\in M$. Here, a weaker notion is that of consistency: $u$ is said to be consistent with $\\pi$ if $\\pi(g) \\leq \\pi(g')$ implies $u(g) \\geq u(g')$ for all $g, g' \\in M$.\nNote that SD-EF1 is a stronger notion than EF1: if an allocation is SD-EF1 with respect to utilities $(u_i)_{i \\in N}$, then it must be EF1 with respect to $(u_i)_{i \\in N}$, as well as with respect to any other utility profile $(u'_i)_{i \\in N}$ where, for each $i$, the utility $u'$ is consistent with the ranking $\\pi_i$ induced by $u_i$.\nThe following lemma provides a useful observation about SD-EF1 with respect to a profile with identical valuations; recall that the market valuation can be seen as such a profile.\nNote that SD-EF1 is a stronger notion than EF1: if an allocation is SD-EF1 with respect to utilities $(u_i)_{i \\in N}$, then it must be EF1 with respect to $(u_i)_{i \\in N}$, as well as with respect to any other utility profile $(u'_i)_{i \\in N}$ where, for each $i$, the utility $u'$ is consistent with the ranking $\\pi_i$ induced by $u_i$.\nFor the last part of the lemma, it suffices to observe that when $u'$ is consistent with $\\pi$, for every good $g \\in M$, there exists a good $g' \\in M$ such that $\\{g'' \\in M : u'_i(g'') \\geq u'_i(g)\\} = \\{g'' \\in M : g'' \\succ_{\\pi} g'\\}$.

Hence, the only interesting consideration is to demand PO w.r.t. the subjective utilities. Here, we show that PO cannot be achieved with SD-EF1 (Theorem 4). Interestingly, SD-EF1 implies both EF1 and balancedness ($|A_i| \\in \\{\\lfloor m/n \\rfloor, \\lceil m/n \\rceil\\}$ for all $i$), and both these relaxations can individually be attained together with PO [14, 17].\nThat is, A provides an equal division under all the $t$ densities."}, {"title": "4.2 MMS and EFX", "content": "In addition to EF1, two fairness criteria that have received significant attention in the discrete fair division are maximin share fairness (MMS) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX).

First, we briefly introduce the cake-cutting model. The cake is represented by the interval $[0, 1]$. A piece of the cake is a Borel subset of $[0, 1]$. Valuations over the cake are defined via density functions. Specifically, under an integrable density function $f : [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the value assigned to any piece $X$ of the cake is denoted (with a slight abuse of notation) as $f(X) := \\int_X f(x) dx$; this induces a (countably additive) measure over the cake that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure and, hence, non-atomic.\nLet $N$ denote a set of $n$ agents participating in the cake division. An allocation $A = (A_1, ..., A_n)$ is a partition of the cake $[0, 1]$ into $n$ pairwise-disjoint pieces. Each agent $i \\in N$ has a subjective density function $u_i$; her utility in allocation $A = (A_1, ..., A_n)$ is $u_i(A_i)$. Also, there is a market density function $v$ that captures the market values of the pieces, i.e., $v(X)$ denotes the market value of piece $X$.\nAn allocation $A = (A_1, ..., A_n)$ is envy-free (EF) w.r.t. subjective utilities if $u_i(A_i) \\geq u_i(A_j)$ for all agents $i, j \\in N$, and envy-free with respect to the market valuation if $v(A_i) = v(A_j)$ for all $i, j \\in N$."}, {"title": "5.1 Envy-Free Cake Division", "content": "In this section, we study the existence and properties of cake allocations that are envy-free both w.r.t. subjective utilities and market valuation. The existence of such an allocation is rather easy to establish (as we note below), hence, we focus on two questions: (a) how many cuts are required in such an allocation, and (b) how many queries must be made in the Robertson-Webb model to find such an allocation.\nAnalogously, for EF under $v$, the entire cake $[0, 1]$ must also be divided equally\u2014by length\u2014between the $n$ pieces. Now, given that $[0, 1/2]$ is already divided equally, the same also holds for $[1/2, 1]$. This requires at least $n - 1$ cuts in $[1/2, 1]$ as well. Hence, in total, at least $2n - 2$ cuts are necessary to obtain EF allocation $A$. The theorem stands proved."}, {"title": "5.2 Pareto Optimality", "content": "This section addresses the inclusion of Pareto Efficiency as an additional desideratum in cake division. It is known that, under agents' subjective utilities, there always exists an cake allocation that is envy-free and Pareto optimal (PO) [38]. In particular, an allocation that maximizes the Nash social welfare (i.e., the product of agents' utilities) is one such fair and efficient allocation [34]. Now, when considering the market valuation, note that any allocation will be trivially PO.\nHence, an interesting question is whether there always exists a cake division that is EF and PO on the subjective side as well as EF on the market side. It is easy to observe that, as in the case of indivisible goods (Section 4.1), such a guarantee cannot be achieved if the agents' densities are zero for parts of the cake. For example, consider an instance with two agents such that agent 1 has positive density over $[0, 2/3]$, but zero density over $[2/3, 1]$. By contrast, agent 2 has zero density in $[0, 2/3]$, but positive value density over $[2/3, 1]$. Note that the only allocation $A = (A_1, A_2)$ that is PO with respect to these agents' utilities entails $A_1 = [0, 2/3]$ and $A_2 = [2/3, 1]$. However, if the market density $v$ is uniform over the entire cake $[0, 1]$, then EF for $v$ would demand that the pieces assigned to the two agents have equal"}]}

Shih"], "abstract": "In medical imaging, accurate diagnosis heavily relies on effective image enhancement techni-ques, particularly for X-ray images. Existing methods often suffer from various challenges such as sacrificing global image characteristics over local image characteristics or vice versa. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called G-CLAHE (Global-Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which perfectly suits medical imaging with a focus on X-rays. This method adapts from Global Histogram Equalization (GHE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to take both advantages and avoid weakness to preserve local and global characteristics. Experimental results show that it can significantly improve current state-of-the-art algorithms to effectively address their limitations and enhance the contrast and quality of X-ray images for diagnostic accuracy.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "X-ray images have been extensively used in biomedical and medical domains due to the wealth of information they provide for medical diagnosis.1,11 When an X-ray beam traverses the body, its initial uniform intensity is altered as it interacts with various organs and tissues. The X-ray images have varying levels of brightness due to the different attenuation abilities of various body organs. These tissues can generally be categorized into four distinct groups based on their capacity to attenuate X-rays, as outlined in Table 1. Raw medical X-ray images usually have low contrast, which is difficult for accurate medical diagnosis. Therefore, it is essential to use appropriate image enhancement methods to increase the quality of such important images."}, {"title": "2. Global Histogram Equalization", "content": "To enhance image quality based on some pre-defined measure, we need to apply an operator on the input image to obtain the enhanced output. This operator can be conducted on the spatial domain directly or on the frequency domain after image transformation. Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are some popular frequency-domain transforms. \nHE is widely used in image enhancement to deal directly with spatial domains. It is considered as a mask or global operator depending on the implementation as GHE or AHE. The basic idea is to increase the contrast to make the details of the image more noticeable. The way this algorithm works is by redistributing pixel intensities to achieve a more uniform histogram. This process involves analyzing the histogram of the original image, deriving a transformation to balance the distribution of in-tensities, and then applying this transformation to restructure the intensity values of"}, {"title": "3. Adaptive Histogram Equalization", "content": "The fundamental approach of AHE is to divide an image into smaller regions, which are called tiles, and apply HE independently to each tile. Therefore, in AHE only neighboring pixels influence a pixel's new intensity value. The choice of tile size as a critical parameter is important, and a common practice of 8 \u00d7 8 is used.\nOne of the drawbacks of the AHE algorithm is the checkerboard effect since the image is divided into tiles and each tile is processed separately. The resulting pixels around the borders of the tiles might not match perfectly, and therefore, these regions around the borders might look unrealistic. One solution is to use bi-linear interpolation, which can reduce the artificial appearance of the borders of tiles after HE is applied on each tile. It calculates these new pixel values based on a weighted average of the nearest four pixels, resulting in a smoother transition and a more natural-looking result.\nHowever, the AHE can potentially cause noise over-amplification. Assume that while using the AHE algorithm, there is a specific tile that has a noise in it, but apart from that, the rest of the pixel intensities are very uniform. In this case, since HE potentially increases contrast, it can lead to the amplification of noise in that specific tile."}, {"title": "4. The Proposed Methodology", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the CLAHE, which can avoid the noise over-amplification problem. Noise over-amplification occurs when the AHE extremely increases the contrast of a tile that has noise. The CLAHE controls the slope of the CDF of the image histogram by a clipping factor to avoid too much contrast. If the difference in CDF value of any two adjacent gray levels is greater than the clipping factor, it is set to the clipping factor. With respect to an image histogram, CLAHE cuts the top part of the histogram and then redistributes it all over the histogram. The top part is considered as the histogram values that exceed the clipping factor. \nHowever, the problem with CLAHE is that it purely focuses on the local image characteristics, and the clipping is carried out on each local region independently. However, there might be some cases in which global image characteristics are as important as local features, and in such cases, CLAHE will have poor performance because it only considers local features, and in some cases, local characteristics might be meaningless. Another challenge in CLAHE is that the clipping factor should be chosen wisely for the algorithm to perform correctly."}, {"title": "5. Experimental Results", "content": "In this section, we describe the dataset that has been employed in our experiments. Several key similarity/dissimilarity metrics are used to compare our algorithm with other approaches. A large dataset of chest X-ray images is used; among them, 1349 images are used for the training. These images have different sizes from 912 \u00d7 672 to 2916 \u00d7 2663 pixels. For the experiments, images are selected randomly to ensure the results are independent of a particular set of images.\nUnlike similarity metrics such as PSNR or SSIM, which are used to assess the similarity between two images, we employ the evaluation metrics focused on specific characteristics of the enhanced images to quantitatively evaluate our proposed approach. While the similarity metrics are useful for assessing the similarity between two images, they do not fully capture the effectiveness of an image enhancement"}, {"title": "6. Conclusions", "content": "In summary, medical X-ray images are crucial for medical diagnoses, but they often have low contrast. The development of G-CLAHE offers a new way to enhance these images, specifically tailored for X-rays. By combining the strengths of GHE and CLAHE, G-CLAHE preserves both local and global image characteristics while avoiding common issues like noise over-amplification. The experiments have shown that our framework does not depend on any specific similarity metric. Through"}]}

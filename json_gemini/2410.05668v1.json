Scholars have noted the interconnectedness of these concepts with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), highlighting their growing significance [Kioupi and Voulvoulis, 2020]. For instance, ethical concerns in artificial intelligence research (AI), a rapidly advancing field, have underscored the importance of human diversity, particularly gender diversity [Leavy, 2018]. Diversity, originally addressed in various disciplines like biology and knowledge, extends beyond human populations. How is diversity measured? Let me briefly introduce existing diversity definitions, discuss the utilities of ensuring diversity in several domains, outline challenges with the existing definitions, and explain the objectives of this study.\nCommonly cited diversity definitions include richness (based on the number of categories in a population), Shannon entropy (derived from the logarithm of category proportions), and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (calculated using the squared proportions of categories). Additionally, a composite index known as \u201ctrue diversity\" (or \"hill number\"), characterized by a single parameter, has been proposed [Hill, 1973, Peet, 1974, Jost, 2006].\nThe following is a definition of true diversity:\n$D_q(p) = \\begin{cases} (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^q)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}, & \\text{if } q \\neq 1, \\\\ (\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{p_i})^{-1}, & \\text{if } q = 1. \\end{cases}$\nHowever when $q = 1$ and $p_i = 0$, $p_i \\log p_i := 1$.Here, n is the number of categories, $p_i \\in [0, 1]$ is the proportion of category i, and $\\sum_{i=1}^n P_i = 1$. $p = (p_1,..., p_n)^T$ is a column vector. $q \\in [0, \\infty]$ is the variable defining this index.\nThis index becomes the following indices depending on the value of $q$:\n$D_0(p) = |\\{i \\in \\{1, ..., n\\} : p_i > 0\\}|$,\n$D_2(p) = (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)^{-1}$,\n$D_\\infty(p) = (\\max_{i \\in \\{1,...,n\\}} p_i)^{-1}$.\nThus, it indirectly includes several indices and concepts, such as the Shannon entropy, richness, Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and Berger-Parker index."}, {"title": "2 Method", "content": "Many studies have shown that ensuring this diversity has utilities in biology, society, and artificial intelligence. In this study, utility means that indices of diversity are related to the performance of the population as a whole. Specifically, let us consider a scenario with r populations. $D_s = (D_1, ..., D_r)$ represents a vector consisting of the diversity D of each population, and $y_s = (y_1,..., y_r)$ is a vector reflecting the performance-related values y for each population. Diversity has utility when there is a correlation between these $D_s$ and $y_s$. However, it is crucial to note that diversity not only holds utility but also carries an obligatory aspect.\nIn biology, studies highlight the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem productivity, including biomass, as well as the prevalence of infectious diseases [Gibson et al., 2001, Keesing et al., 2010]. In the social sciences, diversity among individuals within organizations correlates with productivity [Reagans and Zuckerman, 2001, Horwitz and Horwitz, 2007]. Similarly, in economics\u2014particularly urban economics\u2014diversity of goods is related to preferences for cities [Dixit and Stiglitz, 1977]. In information engineering, it has been noted that the diversity of output results in a recommendation system is important [Kunaver and Po\u017erl, 2017]. Moreover, within the realm of AI and machine learning, diversity in data and models is important for improving prediction accuracy [Gong et al., 2019], with methods proposed to ensure fairness by upholding diversity [Mitchell et al., 2020].\nDespite the widespread attention to diversity across various fields and its practical utility, existing diversity indices encounter several challenges. One significant issue is that many existing definitions, such as the Hill number, fail to incorporate considerations of similarity or dissimilarity (distance) between categories. To address this gap, several indices have been proposed that integrate similarity and proportion. For instance, Gibson et al. [2001] proposed an index based on the categorical distances (taxonomic distinctness), and Leinster [2021] proposed an index that combines similarity with proportion [Gibson et al., 2001, Leinster and Cobbold, 2012, Leinster, 2021]. However, these studies encountered limitations by not accounting for interactions between categories and relying on externally provided similarity measures, raising questions about the appropriate choice of similarity metrics.\nMany existing indices do not consider interactions between categories, yet these interactions are important for understanding utility. For instance, Reagans and Zuckerman [2001] emphasize the significance of both diversity and networks within R&D-related teams. From an ethical perspective, diversity and inclusiveness are indispensable. While the concept of inclusion is"}, {"title": "2.1 Proposed Index", "content": "As described in Section 1, based on existing studies, including Jost [2006], Leinster [2021], and Morales et al. [2021], I propose a novel diversity and inclusion index that integrates considerations of similarity and network dynamics.\nThe inputs are {p, Z, E, q}. Partially, as defined in Section 1, we assume n categories. It is also possible to assume that there is no population and consider one sample as one category. i, j are the identification numbers assigned to the categories and have values from 1 to n. $p = (p_1, ..., p_n)$ is a"}, {"title": "2.2 Analysis of Proposed Index", "content": "In this section, we discuss the properties of the proposed index. Specifically, we investigate how the differences in q, Z, and E affect the proposed index. In addition, the relationship between existing and proposed indices is discussed.\nFirst, the following proposition holds:\nProposition 1. $D_q^s(p, E)$ is monotonically decreasing with respect to q.\nProof. Assuming $\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i = 1$, $z_i \\in R$, $n \\in Z$, and $f : X \\rightarrow R$ is a convex function, from Jensen's inequality, we have $f (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i z_i) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i f(z_i)$. If $y_i \\ge 0$, $b > 0$, $c > 0$, $b < c$, $f(y_i) = y_i^z$, $Z_i = x_i$, then $f'(y_i) > 0$ and $f''(y_i) > 0$. Substituting into the previous inequality, we get\n$(\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i)^b \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i^b \\rightarrow (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i)^c \\le (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i^c)^{\\frac{b}{c}}$\nSince $(\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i x_i)^t$ monotonically increases with respect to t, assuming $t = 1 \u2013 q$, $x_i = 1/ ((L - Z \\circ E) p)_i$, we have\n$(\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i ((L \u2212 Z \\circ E) p)_i)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}} = (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i ((L \u2212 Z \\circ E) p)_i)^{-1}$monotonically increases with respect to $1 \u2013 q$. That is, it monotonically decreases with respect to q.\nNext, when $Z_{i,j} \\ge Z'_{i,j}$ for all i, j, we denote in this paper $Z > Z'$. When $E_{i,j} \\ge E'_{i,j}$ for all i, j, we denote $E > E'$. The following proposition holds:\nProposition 2. If E and p are fixed, and $Z > Z'$, then $D_q^s(p, E) \\le D_q^s(p, E')$. If Z and p are fixed, and $E \\le E'$, then $D_q^s(p, E) \\le D_q^s(p, E').$\nProof. When $Z > Z'$, then $Z < Z'$. E is fixed, then $L \u2212 Z \\circ E > L \u2212 Z' \\circ E$. Assuming that p is fixed, if $0 < q < 1$, then $q - 1 < 0$, so\n$p_i ((L-Z \\circ E) p)^{-1} \\le p_i ((L-Z' E) p)^{-1}$.\nIn addition, $\\frac{1}{1-q} > 0$, we get\n$(\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i ((L \u2212 Z \\circ E) p)_i)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}} \\le (\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i ((L \u2212 Z' \\circ E) p)_i)^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}$"}, {"title": "2.3 Methods for Estimating Similarity", "content": "In the previous section, Z and E simply used predefined values. Similarities have also been exogenously reported in existing studies [Leinster, 2021]. However, a question arises as to which similarities or dissimilarities should be used. In addition, the question of which attributes should be emphasized when using the Euclidean distances between attributes remains. This is important because it also relates to the question of whether the diversity of demographic attributes, such as gender and age, or the diversity of tasks, such as skills, within an organization should be emphasized in fields such as management studies [Horwitz and Horwitz, 2007]. Therefore, we propose a method for estimating these similarities based on the utility described in Section 1.\nThe input is {ys, Dsq}, where $D_sq = (D_q^s (p, E)_1, ..., D_q^s (p, E)_r)$. Note that n and Z were fixed for all populations.\nSpecifically, I defined a weighted Euclidean distance using weights w* = {$w_1,..., w_a$} for x such that the correlation is maximized as follows: Finally, the weighted distance was used to calculate diversity.\n$w^* = \\underset{w_1,..., w_a}{\\text{argmax}} \\; cor(y_s, D_{sq})^2$,\nsubject to $w_1, . . ., w_a \\in [0, 1]$, $\\sum_{m=1}^a w_m = 1$,\nwhere $Z = L \u2212 Z$, $Z_{ij} = e^{-d(x_i,x_j)}$, $d(x_i, x_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^T W (x_i - x_j)}$, W is a diagonal matrix where $w_1,..., w_a$ are the diagonal components, and cor is the correlation function between $y_s$ and $D_{sq}$. Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, and nonlinear correlation (Maximal Information Coefficient; MIC) are available for correlation [Reshef et al., 2011].\nThe problem is a complex, constrained nonlinear optimization using weighted Euclidean distances. Therefore, it is necessary to use optimization methods such as sequential least squares programming (SLSQP) [Biggs, 1975, Gill et al., 2019]. It is noteworthy that the optimal solution may depend on the initial values."}, {"title": "2.4 Visualization", "content": "So far, the research has primarily focused on developing the proposed diversity index. However, the data used to calculate this index consists of several elements, including category proportions, similarities, and networks. The complexity of this can make it challenging to intuitively grasp the characteristics of a group. Therefore, a visualization method is proposed to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the original data.\nThe input is {p, E, Z}, which is part of the variable. The following procedure was used:\n1. Centralize the dissimilarity matrix Z:\n$Z_{ce} = \\frac{1}{2} C Z^2 C$, $C = I - \\frac{1}{2} L$,\nwhere I is the identity matrix.\n2. Eigenvalue decomposition of $Z_{ce}$. Then we obtain the matrix \u039b with the eigenvalues \u03bb as diagonal components and matrix V of the eigenvector v:\n$Z_{ce} = V\u039bV^{-1}$,\nwhere\n$\u039b = \\begin{pmatrix} \u03bb_1 & 0 & ... \\\\ 0 & \u03bb_2 & \\\\ ... &  &  \\end{pmatrix}$, V = (v1, v2, . . .).\n3. Eigenvalues other than \u03bb1, \u03bb2 of \u039b are set to 0. The following calculations were performed:\n$X^* = V\u039b$.\n4. Place each category using $X^*$.\n5. The diameter of each circle was calculated based on the values of p in each category.\n6. E was used to create a network (link) between each category, and the thickness of the network (link) was the width of the network (link)."}, {"title": "3 Empirical Analysis", "content": "First, based on Z, each category was placed in two dimensions using the multidimensional scaling (MDS) concept [Saeed et al., 2018]. The dissimilarity between categories was preserved in two dimensions. The proportions of the categories were then expressed in terms of the diameter of the circle. Finally, the relationship between categories was represented by a directed graph, with the thickness of the arrows representing the strength of the relationship.\nThe significance of this visualization is fourfold.(1)The similarities and biases between categories can be understood. (2) The size and bias of the category distribution can be understood.(3) When dissimilarity and E are large, there is a distance between categories in two dimensions, and the arrows between them are thicker and therefore appear larger. Therefore, networks that significantly influenced diversity could be identified.(4) Conversely, it is easy to consider the type of network required between the categories."}, {"title": "3.1 Data", "content": "To verify the utility of the proposed index, the diversity that people prefer in organizations was investigated.

If the correlation is positive, the proposed index can be used to design an ethically preferred organization.\nThe details of this study are as follows: First, participants were presented with several hypothetical organizations in Japan. These organizations included Japanese men, Japanese women, and foreigners (men), with each category's proportion and the degree of communication between categories represented by the thickness of network links in an undirected graph (representing bi-directional connections) (Figure 1). Next, the study investigated people's preferences for such organizations using a specific question: \u201cImagine a Japanese company where an organization has the following proportions and connections: Please rate this organization on an 11-point scale, with 10 being 'good,' 5 being \u2018undecided,' and 0 being 'not good'.

This suggests the need to examine diversity by considering similarities and networks.\nThe novelty and distinctiveness of this study are outlined as follows:\n1.

In this study, diversity is proposed to be indexed as a scalar, which means that the interactions among proportions, networks, and similarities are accounted for. Each of these processes can be broken down and handled separately. Furthermore, despite partial discussion, the relationships between various types of network diversity indices proposed by Morales et al. and the index in this study have not been thoroughly analyzed [Morales et al., 2021]. Further analysis and empirical studies are required, especially in cases where E is an n-square, as described in the definitions in Section 2."}]}

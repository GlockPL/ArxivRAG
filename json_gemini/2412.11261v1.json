Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a carefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional reference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent evaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual coherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness. CATER's unique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the source and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly identify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall scores. This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or domain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages, genres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt modifications. CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments, capturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and discourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. By uniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the scalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators worldwide. The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging community-driven refinement and further empirical validation.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Machine translation (MT) evaluation has long depended on reference-based, string-matching metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or edit-distance variants like TER (Snover et al., 2006). While these metrics accelerated early MT research, their reliance on static references and inability to capture contextual, stylistic, or informational subtleties have become increasingly problematic. Neural-based metrics, including COMET (Rei et al., 2020), have improved correlations with human judgments but remain limited in scope. They often focus narrowly on semantic fidelity, leaving critical dimensions\u2014such as discourse coherence, stylistic appropriateness, and domain-specific completeness\u2014insufficiently addressed.\n\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) opens a new era of translation evaluation. LLMs, including GPT-4 and other advanced transformers, possess broad multilingual capabilities and can understand textual nuances well beyond surface-level correspondences. They offer the unprecedented opportunity to perform dynamic, context-aware evaluations without rigid reliance on a single reference translation. Yet to fully harness LLMs for evaluation, we need a principled framework that integrates multiple quality dimensions and translates them into actionable, quantifiable scores.\n\nThis paper presents the Comprehensive AI-assisted Translation Edit Ratio (CATER), a next-generation MT evaluation framework that seamlessly integrates with LLMs through prompt-based instructions. CATER moves beyond single-metric evaluations by targeting five key dimensions\u2014Linguistic Accuracy (LA), Semantic Accuracy (SA), Contextual Fit (CF), Stylistic Appropriateness (STA), and Information Completeness (IC) each grounded in established quality frameworks like MQM and DQF. Crucially, CATER's approach is operationalized via an LLM: the user provides a standardized prompt, source text, and target text, and the LLM identifies required edits, calculates category-specific Edit Ratios (ER%), and outputs dimension-specific and overall scores.\n\nThis direct LLM integration yields several immediate benefits:\n\nReference independence: CATER dispenses with single canonical references, allowing for the evaluation of diverse or creative MT outputs.\n\nMultilingual and domain adaptability: By simply adjusting prompt instructions or weights, evaluators can tailor CATER to any language pair, domain, or stylistic requirement.\n\nScalability and ease of implementation: No custom models or extensive training data are required. Any environment supporting LLM-based inference can host a CATER evaluation session.\n\nContextual and stylistic sensitivity: Through the LLM's inherent contextual understanding, CATER more effectively captures subtleties like discourse-level coherence, cultural tone, or factual"}, {"title": "2. Background and Related Work", "content": "2.1 Traditional Metrics\n\n\u2022\tBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002): BLEU, or Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, was one of the first widely adopted metrics for evaluating machine translation. It measures the n-gram precision between the machine translation output and one or more reference translations. While rapid and widely used, its simplistic overlap measures fail to account for paraphrastic variation or discourse-level factors.\n\n\u2022\tTER (Snover et al., 2006): Translation Edit Rate (TER) measures the number of edits needed to change a machine-translated sentence into the reference sentence. Edits can include insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts. TER introduces edit-distance calculations to estimate post-editing effort. TER's conceptual foundation informs CATER, but TER's dependence on a single reference and lack of multidimensional evaluation remain limiting.\n\n\u2022\tMETEOR (Banerjee & Lavie, 2005): Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering (METEOR) was designed to address some of the weaknesses in BLEU. It uses a combination of exact word matching, stemming, synonym matching, and paraphrase matching to align and score the machine translation against a reference.\n\n2.2 Neural-Based Metrics\n\n\u2022\tCOMET (Rei et al., 2020): COMET (Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation) is a neural framework for MT evaluation that uses a multilingual pre-trained language model to score the MT output. It leverages deep representations to correlate closely with human judgments. However, it focuses primarily on semantic fidelity at segment-level granularity and does not inherently address style, context, or information completeness.\n\n2.3 Multidimensional Frameworks\n\n\u2022\tMQM (Multidimensional Quality Metrics): MQM provides a comprehensive framework for defining and categorizing translation quality issues. It allows for a detailed analysis of different error types and their severity.\n\n\u2022\tDQF (Dynamic Quality Framework): DQF, developed by TAUS, is another framework for translation quality evaluation that integrates with translation workflows. It allows users to customize quality criteria based on content type, audience, and purpose.\n\nHowever, both MQM and DQF typically require manual annotation, limiting scalability and not systematically addressing hallucinations, omissions, or contextual dependencies. In essence, no existing metric fully addresses the complexity of modern MT outputs. CATER draws inspiration from these approaches but transcends their constraints by employing an LLM-based, prompt-driven evaluation method. This approach enables comprehensive, scalable, and automated quality assessment."}, {"title": "3. The CATER Framework", "content": "CATER advances beyond single-reference and one-dimensional constraints by evaluating translation quality across five key dimensions. Each dimension resonates with MQM categories and dovetails with DQF's workflow-oriented perspective:\n\n3.1 Linguistic Accuracy (LA)\n\nReflecting MQM's \"Fluency\" and \"Grammaticality,\" LA assesses basic linguistic correctness\u2014grammar, orthography, punctuation, and morphology. While seemingly fundamental, poor LA undermines trust and readability. Even minor linguistic errors damage credibility. Generally weighted moderately, but can be deprioritized if semantics or information fidelity outweigh stylistic nuances.\n\n3.2 Semantic Accuracy (SA)\n\nAligned with MQM's \"Accuracy,\" SA focuses on ensuring that the source text's meaning is faithfully conveyed. SA identifies mistranslations, semantic distortions, and hallucinations\u2014cases where the translated text introduces meanings not present in the original or alters the intended sense. Unlike IC, which specifically addresses the omission or addition of critical factual information, SA targets issues where the semantic relationships or conceptual fidelity are compromised without necessarily losing or altering key facts. In other words, SA deals with incorrect or skewed interpretations of the source's meaning rather than missing or extra factual elements. This makes SA critical in domains where capturing subtle nuances and avoiding semantic shifts is paramount. Often heavily weighted in high-stakes contexts, any semantic distortion can undermine the translation's purpose and clarity.\n\n3.3 Contextual Fit (CF)\n\nExpanding upon MQM's discourse-level coherence, CF ensures that the translation's internal logic, pronoun reference, temporal consistency, and narrative integrity are preserved. For long-form texts or domain-specific documentation, CF becomes indispensable. May be weighted highly in contexts where narrative integrity or logical consistency is imperative.\n\n3.4 Stylistic Appropriateness (STA)\n\nRelated to MQM's \"Style\" and DQF's adaptation mechanisms, STA ensures the tone, register, and style match the intended audience and purpose. Appropriate style can be critical in branding, literary translation, or culturally sensitive communication. Critical in texts where tone and audience appropriateness define success\u2014literary works, diplomatic communications, or branding materials.\n\n3.5 Information Completeness (IC)\n\nComplementing MQM's focus on omissions and additions, IC addresses whether all critical facts,"}, {"title": "3.6 Weighting and Customization", "content": "CATER allows for domain- and project-specific weighting. A technical manual might prioritize IC and SA, while a marketing text might emphasize STA. This flexibility transforms CATER from a fixed metric into a versatile evaluation platform aligning with diverse user priorities."}, {"title": "3.7 LLM-Powered Prompt-based Evaluation", "content": "CATER's key innovation lies in its operationalization: the evaluation is performed by prompting an LLM with a structured set of instructions (see Appendix). Given the source and translated texts, the LLM identifies \u201cWords to Correct\" for each category, computes the Edit Ratio (ER%), and converts these values into Category Scores and an Overall Score. By relying on the LLM's inherent language understanding, CATER not only bypasses the need for reference translations but also exploits the LLM's adaptability. With minor prompt edits, the framework can shift weighting, emphasize particular dimensions, or focus on a specific domain."}, {"title": "4. Scoring Methodology: ER%, Category Scores, and Overall Score", "content": "Each dimension yields a \"Words to Correct\" count, signifying the minimal textual edits needed to meet acceptable standards. From these counts, we derive the Category Edit Ratio (ER%):\n\nER%_category = (Words to Correct_category / Original Word Count) * 100\n\nA small ER% indicates fewer necessary edits, implying higher quality in that dimension. For interpretability, ER% values are mapped onto a 0-100 Category Score, with 100 indicating near-perfection and lower scores indicating greater issues. Adjusting each category's Weight modifies the impact of its ER% on the Category Score, ensuring that dimensions vital to the user's objectives carry greater influence on the final evaluation.\n\nSumming weighted Category Scores produces an Overall Score (0\u2013100) and aggregating ER%s yields an Overall ER%. While the Overall Score provides a top-level quality indicator, Category Scores and ER%s supply the granularity needed for targeted improvements. This hierarchical approach-from dimension-specific diagnostics to holistic assessments\u2014facilitates both high-level comparison and in-depth quality management."}, {"title": "5. Advantages of an LLM-Driven Approach", "content": "5.1 Immediate Global Applicability\n\nBy harnessing an LLM's pre-trained multilingual capabilities, CATER is immediately applicable to virtually any language pair. Users need only supply the source and target texts plus a suitable prompt. This universality is a departure from traditional metrics requiring language-specific resources.\n\n5.2 Flexible Customization and Scalability\n\nCATER's prompt-based design allows evaluators to adjust weights per category, incorporate domain-specific guidelines, or add new quality dimensions without retraining models or collecting parallel data. The scalability and flexibility of this prompt-driven approach make CATER particularly appealing to large-scale translation agencies, global enterprises, and research institutions that handle a wide range of content types and linguistic profiles.\n\n5.3 Real-time Iteration and Refinement\n\nWhen evaluation outputs seem off or misaligned with user priorities, a simple prompt modification can produce a revised scoring scheme. This iterative cycle encourages a more interactive relationship between the evaluator and the metric, bridging conceptual frameworks and practical translation workflows.\n\n5.4 Eliminating Reference Dependency\n\nUnlike BLEU or TER, which depend on carefully constructed reference translations, CATER uses the LLM's contextual understanding to measure quality directly from the source and target texts. This enables evaluation of creative or user-tailored translations, as well as detection of subtle errors that might not appear if relying on a single \u201ccorrect\u201d reference."}, {"title": "6. Example Application and Illustrative Scenario", "content": "6.1 Example Application and Illustrative Scenario\n\nConsider a scenario where a source text is a political speech intended to inspire trust, mobilize voters, and evoke a sense of collective purpose. The original passage envisions a brighter future on Inauguration Day, emphasizes scientific integrity, environmental stewardship, economic uplift, and social equality, culminating in a call-to-action to vote decisively and leave no doubt about collective identity and values.

Benchmarking and Future Research", "content": "CATER's conceptual architecture supports rigorous comparison with established metrics on standard datasets, including the WMT metrics shared tasks. While this paper focuses on conceptual foundations and illustrative scenarios rather than large-scale empirical validation, future work will systematically benchmark CATER against widely used metrics-such as BLEU, TER, and COMET\u2014and measure its correlations with human judgments. Evaluators may apply CATER to standard evaluation sets from WMT (Barrault et al., 2020; Bojar et al., 2016) or test it across diverse domains and language pairs. As LLM architectures advance, the framework's sensitivity and discriminative power will likely improve, offering evaluations that become more consistent, contextually aware, and aligned with human expectations.\n\nIndustry practitioners can also leverage CATER for large-scale analyses of parallel corpora, using its multidimensional insights to refine their MT workflows, inform retraining strategies, or guide targeted improvements in system outputs. Beyond benchmarking, future research will explore prompt optimization techniques, domain-specific extensions, and seamless integration with translation pipelines. For example, enterprises could incorporate CATER into QA processes, using LLMs to detect errors in real-time, dynamically adjust quality thresholds, or ensure stylistic consistency that aligns with brand identities.\n\nCrucially, CATER is openly released, and we invite practitioners, researchers, and language professionals worldwide to experiment with the framework. Their feedback and data-driven insights will inform ongoing refinements, fostering a global, collaborative evolution of CATER.

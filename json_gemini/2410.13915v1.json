Yet, studying these effects in real-world settings at scale is ethically and logistically impractical, highlighting a need for simulation tools that can model these dynamics in controlled settings to enable experimentation with possible defenses. We present a simulation environment designed to address this. We elaborate upon the Concordia framework that simulates offline, 'real life' activity by adding online interactions to the simulation through social media with the integration of a Mastodon server. We improve simulation efficiency and information flow, and add a set of measurement tools, particularly longitudinal surveys. We demonstrate the simulator with a tailored example in which we track agents' political positions and show how partisan manipulation of agents can affect election results.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly persuasive [1, 2]. While this can be a positive indicator that they are delivering high quality and compelling responses, it also means they have increasing ability to manipulate. Even before ChatGPT, sophisticated technology-enabled manipulation was creating large-scale risks and harm [3-12]. Now, with persuasion capabilities surpassing average human levels in many settings [1, 13, 2, 14, 15], there is a worsening threat of severe harm through societal-scale manipulation [16, 17], both through flooding the airwaves so \"nobody knows what's true anymore\" [18], and more personalized, targeted manipulation of individuals at automated scale [15]. Robust ways to mitigate such risks are urgently needed.\nHowever, doing so remains difficult given our inability to effectively and consistently perform experiments, be it simulating attacks and threats or evaluating the effectiveness of defenses against AI-powered manipulation. This lack of experimental control is pervasive in the social sciences, where societal-scale treatments are challenging to implemente.g., amidst the many confounding factors in misinformation spread and the ethical concerns regarding manipulative human experimentation."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "There have been many attempts to replicate complex systems in hopes of creating believable, but tractable, simulations that can mimic social dynamics with high fidelity in order to explain or probe specific phenomena. One area of focus has been online environments, such as social media, where issues like misinformation and polarization abound; many efforts [21-27] attempt to simulate these settings with relatively simple social characteristics (e.g., homophily), but without necessarily emulating the full complexity of these online settings. Several works [28\u201333] also focus on the algorithmic aspects of these online settings by modeling algorithms to directly modulate the likelihood of agent interactions or connections, information visibility, and more.\nMore recently, given their ability to emulate human-like behavior and responses, a number of works have highlighted the promise of LLM agents for simulations. LLMs have been studied as individuals through diverse lenses such as politics [34], psychology [35, 36], marketing [37], and behavior [38, 39]. While not without limitations [40], these works show the ability of LLMs to reflect realistic individual behavior in many settings. Several works have built frameworks with multiple interacting LLM agents, aiming to produce interesting or realistic phenomena. [19, 41, 20, 42] provide general environments where LLM agents adopt personas and interact amongst themselves in settings such as fictitious towns. Some works [43\u201346] build social media simulations, providing insights into topics like social movements and news feed algorithms. However, to our knowledge, our work is the first to integrate a real, rather than facsimile, social media platform with the aim of constructing a scalable testbed for solutions to large-scale manipulation. We also are not aware of the use of social values as generative agent traits, though they have been used as feature components for LLM alignment [47]."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "Our work builds upon the Concordia framework, \u201ca software library developed to simulate interactions of generative-model agents in a grounded physical, social, or digital space\" [20]. It relies heavily on LLM-based elaboration of situational and social context using structured text and summarization. Agent models in Concordia are rich and versatile: they have memories, long-term objectives, and even homeostatic drives, all of which are used as rich social context for LLMs to infer agent plans (e.g. What kind of person is X? What situation is X in now? What would a person like X do here?). Social system simulation is then performed by a centralized controller (the 'Gamemaster') that evaluates attempted actions, handles events, and distributes their effects. The simulation runs in discrete steps of fixed simulated time intervals."}, {"title": "4 Analysis", "content": "Agent Personas. The simulation defines an agent's persona through a given set of quantified personality traits (i.e., a trait set) along with an additional set of natural language statements expressing deep-rooted values or deeply-held beliefs. In social sciences and psychology, trait sets can be operationalized as scores on features derived from responses to well-validated survey questions. There is a conditional distribution of score sets over respondent demographic information such as age and gender. We provide a pipeline to process survey responses into trait scores given the scoring map. The Concordia library's default example use random values for the Big-5 personality traits used in psychology, potentially generating unrealistic distributions of agent behaviour. Social values are a related, but distinct set of latent features predictive of behavior. We add to our system a toggle for replacing Big-5 with the standard set of social values [50] and setting their scores using published demographic-conditioned survey data [51] that uses a well-validated 20-question survey [52].\nThese score sets and demographic information are passed to Concordia's agent generation procedure, which takes them, along with name, gender, goal, context, and formative experiences, to generate autobiographical anecdotes that are then summarized by an LLM to form a backstory describing the"}, {"title": "Election Demonstration & Setup", "content": "For our election setting, we configure the generic knowledge possessed by the agents and gamemaster (GM) within Concordia to include information about the fictitious town of Storhampton in which they live, several social/economic issues facing Storhampton, the upcoming mayoral election, and general knowledge about Mastodon (see appendix B for specific texts). This shared context is added to the formative memories of all agents. We introduce several agent types as subjects of study.\n\u2022 General Voting Agents: We built \"Opinion on candidate\" components, where the agent retrieves relevant information from its long-term memory and summarizes it to state their general opinion of each candidate. We use these results alongside the agent's most recent observations, and their personas, to create a verdict on the agent's \"Current Opinion on candidate\" by explicitly prompting the agent to consider recent events and their effects on the voter's perception of a candidate.\n\u2022 Candidate Agents: Candidate agents consist of components that retrieve relevant memories about the evaluations of both the candidates and their opponents. The results from these are used alongside the candidate's persona to give the agent context to come up with a \"Plan to improve Public Perception\u201d for their campaign. Note that we selected two male candidates to control for gender in the experiment.\n\u2022 Malicious Agents: these are similar to the candidate agents, but they are prompted instead to develop a strategy to harm the opposing candidate and improve the perception of the favored candidate using disinformation and other underhanded means."}, {"title": "Simulations", "content": "To demonstrate our simulation framework, we conduct three simulation runs with N = 20 and N = 100 agents each over the span of 24 hours of in-simulation time divided into 30 minute episodes using OpenAI's gpt-40-mini language model. We fix each agent's base social media usage rate to 5 times per day, with times randomly sampled from the 48 possible time steps during which the agent can act. We also add a stochastic usage pattern where agents access the app at a per-step rate of p = 0.15 per episode. For all simulations, we generate a fixed set of agent configurations, with two mayoral candidate agents each having partisan policy proposals related to the city. Candidate Bill campaigns on \"providing tax breaks to local industry and creating jobs to help grow the economy.\u201d, while Bradley campaigns on \"increasing regulation to protect the environment and expanding social programs.\u201d.

We alter a single agent (Glenn) to be a malicious partisan for Bill. This agent is initialized with the goal of strongly advocating for Bill, while convincing others to support Bill using manipulation such as spreading disinformation.

Studies [53-55] have often found LLMs to be left-leaning, so this result may reflect this bias. However, it appears that social interactions eventually override this initial bias. LLM bias have often been studied in single agent and even single turn settings\u2014our framework provides the ability to study"}, {"title": "6 Social Impact Statement", "content": "There is a critical need for evidence-based countermeasures to existing and future manipulation risks. Our simulation system alone will not give all the answers: simulations cannot be perfect reflections of reality, and should not be treated as such they should be supplemented with additional theory and 'real-world' empirical evidence. And further research is needed to refine the system and determine exactly where realism limitations lie. Nonetheless, this tool can significantly unlock and accelerate our ability to gather evidence in this domain, leading to promising defenses to make society robust to large-scale, harmful manipulation.\nWork in topics like manipulation often presents dual-use concerns. In this context, there is currently an empirical imbalance favoring bad actors: free from ethical concerns, they can already try any strategy they like to manipulate people. Meanwhile, good actors generally cannot controllably manipulate people to develop defenses against manipulation. Our sandbox system will help redress this imbalance."}, {"title": "A Agent Survey Prompts", "content": "We poll agents in the simulation on two questions at each time-step:\n1.

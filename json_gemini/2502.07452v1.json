Thus, debates or discussions are represented as directed graphs, with arguments\nas nodes and attacks between arguments as directed edges. Several extension-based semantics have been defined to\nobtain conclusions from argumentation graphs. Such semantics identify subsets of arguments (called extensions),\nrepresenting consistent conclusions [2, 3, 4].\nMotivated by the work of [5], researchers started to focus on semantics which could give a more gradual view on\narguments' acceptability by ranking them from the \u201cless attacked\u201d to the most (not necessarily based on the cardinality\nor quality of the attackers) [6]. A subset of these semantics, called gradual semantics, assign to each argument, a\nnumeric degree representing its strength after taking into account the relation between arguments (e.g., [7]). More\nrecent works expand gradual semantics with supports [8], sets of attacking arguments [9], and initial weights [10]. But,\nwhere do these initial weights come from?\nWhen asking people to elicitate the initial weights of arguments, people often struggle to identify an exact value.\nComplicating this further, in a setting where multiple arguments are presented, people may struggle to differentiate\nbetween the initial weight of an argument, and its final acceptability degree (which takes into account the other\narguments). We therefore argue that from a knowledge engineering point of view - it may make sense to elicit\na single interval from a user which in some sense captures both the argument's initial weight and final acceptability\ndegree.\nIn this paper, we investigate how to narrow down an argumentation system's final acceptability degrees according to\nsome desirable properties by using the elicited value as well as the structure of the argumentation framework. If no such\nrational intervals exist, we seek to find a rational value which requires minimal change from the elicited values. We also\nprovide an implementation and evaluation of our approach\u00b9.\nIn Section 2, we recall the background on formal argumentation and some well-known gradual semantics. Section 3\nsets up the theoretical framework for constrained argumentation frameworks, where arguments are associated with"}, {"title": "2 Background", "content": "We first introduce the necessary argumentation concepts.\nA weighted argumentation framework is composed of arguments, attacks between arguments, and a weighting function\nassociating each argument to an initial weight representing its trustworthiness or certainty degree of its premises.\nDefinition 1 (Weighted Argumentation Framework). An weighted argumentation framework (WAF) is WAF =\n(A, C, w), where A is a finite set of arguments, C \u2286 A \u00d7 A is a set of attacks between arguments, and w is a weighting\nfunction from A to [0, 1].\nGiven wAF = (A,C,w) and a \u2208 A, Att(a) = {b \u2208 A | (b,a) \u2208 C) and Att*(a) = {b \u2208 Att(a) | w(a) \u2260 0}.\nLet x, y \u2208 A. A path from y to x is a sequence (xo,...,xn) of arguments such that xo = y, xn = x and \u2200i s.t.\n0 \u2264 i < n, (xi, Xi+1) \u2208 C.\nThe usual Dung's extension-based semantics [1] induces a two-levels acceptability of arguments (inside or outside\nof one or all extensions). Gradual semantics (and ranking-based semantics in general) have been proposed as a more\nfine-grained approach to argument acceptability [11, 12] and their weighted versions have been defined (e.g., [13]).\nThese gradual semantics use a weighting to assign to each argument in the weighted argumentation framework a score,\ncalled (acceptability) degree.\nDefinition 2 (Weighted Gradual semantics). A weighted gradual semantics is a function \u03c3 which associates to each\nWAF = (A, C, w), a weighting \u03c3wAF : A \u2192 [0, 1] on \u0391. \u03c3wAF(a) is the degree of a.\nLet us now recall the well-known gradual semantics studied in this paper [7, 14, 13]. The weighted h-categorizer\nsemantics (Hbs) assigns a value to each argument by taking into account the initial weight of the argument, the degree\nof its attackers, which themselves take into account the degree of their attackers.\nDefinition 3 (Weighted h-categorizer). The weighted h-categorizer semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma^{Hbs}_{WAF}$ s.t. for any\nwAF = (A, C, w) and a \u2208 A, $\\sigma^{Hbs}_{WAF}(a) = w(a)/(1 + \\Sigma_{b \\in Att(a)}\\sigma^{Hbs}_{WAF}(b))$.\nThe weighted Card-based semantics (Car) favors the number of attackers over their quality. This semantics is based on\na recursive function which assigns a score to each argument on the basis of its initial weight, the number of its direct\nattackers, and their degrees.\nDefinition 4 (Weighted Card-based). The weighted Card-based semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma^{Car}_{WAF}$ s.t. for any\nWAF = (A, C, w) and a \u2208 A, $\\sigma^{Car}_{WAF}(a) = w(a)/(1 + |Att^{*}(a)| + \\Sigma_{b \\in Att^{*}(a)}\\sigma^{Car}_{WAF}(b))$ if $Att^{*}(a) \\neq \\emptyset$, otherwise\n$\\sigma^{Car}_{WAF}(a) = w(a)$.\nThe weighted Max-based semantics (Max) favors the quality of attackers over their number, i.e., the degree of an\nargument is based on its initial weight and the degree of its strongest direct attacker.\nDefinition 5 (Weighted Max-based). The weighted Max-based semantics is a gradual semantics $\\sigma^{Max}_{WAF}$ s.t. any wAF =\n(A, C, w) and a \u2208 \u0391, $\\sigma^{Max}_{WAF}(a) = w(a)/(1+ max_{b \\in Att(a)}\\sigma^{Max}_{WAF}(b))$\nThe usual setting starts from a weighted argumentation framework and utilizes a weighted gradual semantics to compute\nthe acceptability degree. The approach of [14] has shown that we can instead start with the acceptability degree and the\nstructure of the graph to infer the initial weights. But what if we are unsure about the acceptability degrees?

Any such point (da, db) will\nlie within the brown rectangle shown in Figure 2.

This is due\nto the interdependencies between arguments in the final acceptability degree computation process. For example, if\nI(a) = [0.8, 1] and I(b) = [0, 0.5], one would think that the initial weights of a lies between 0.8 and 1 whereas the one\nof b would lie within 0 and 1. Notice that if w(a) = 0.8 and w(b) = 1, we would have $\\sigma_{WAF}(b) \\notin I(b)$.\nIf (cAF, \u03c3) is fully rational, then there is a weighting for any final acceptability degrees within the intervals and is\nthus achievable. In contrast, if (cAF, 6) is rational but not fully rational, then some combination of final acceptability\ndegrees within the interval will not be achievable. e-rationality serves as a measure for \u201chow close to fully rational\" a\n(CAF, \u03c3) pair is.\nDefinition 8. Given cAF = (A,C, I), a gradual semantics \u03c3 and 0 \u2264 e, we say (cAF, \u03c3) is e-rational if for all\na \u2208 A, it holds that:\n\u2022 \u0454 \u2264 max(I(a)) \u2013 min(I(a)); and\n\u2022 ((A, C, \u0399\u03b1), \u03c3) is rational, where for all a' \u2208 A,a' \u2260 a, Ia(a') = I(a') and Ia(a) = [max(I(\u03b1)) \u2013\n\u20ac, max(I(a))],\nAccording to the first item of this definition, e must be smaller or equal to the size of the smallest interval in the CAF.\nThe second item of the definition considers a set of induced CAFs (one per argument) where for each CAF, a specific\nargument's interval is modified so that its lower bound is equal to its upper bound minus \u20ac (and the remaining arguments\nare unchanged). If all such induced CAFs are rational, then in combination with the first condition the original\nCAF is e-rational. Intuitively, this means that the shape $\\times_{a \\in A}I(a)$ is not \u201ctoo far\u201d (i.e., within \u20ac) from the acceptability\ndegree space on all axes.\nObserve that a fully rational CAF must be 0-rational, any e-rational (where \u20ac > 0) CAF is rational (but not fully\nrational), while an irrational CAF is not e-rational for any \u20ac. Note that these are not \"if and only if\" relationships. Thus,\na 0-rational CAF is not necessarily fully rational, but is always rational.\nProposition 1. If (cAF, \u03c3) is e-rational, then (cAF, \u03c3) is rational.\nProof. Let cAF = (A, C, I) and assume (cAF, \u03c3) is e-rational. For any arbitrary a \u2208 A, and 0 \u2264 \u0454 \u2264 max(I(a)) \u2013\nmin(I(a)), we have that ((A, C, Ia), \u03c3) is rational. This means that there exists w : A \u2192 [0, 1] such that $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)} (a) \\in$\n[max(I(a)) \u2013 \u0454, max(I(a))] and for all b \u2208 A \\ {a}, $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(b) \\in I(b)$. Notice that min(I(a)) \u2264 max(I(a)) \u2013 \u0454 \u2264\n$\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(a) \u2264 max(I(a))$, thus $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(a) \\in I(a)$. Thus, (cAF, \u03c3) is rational.\nRationality captures whether some part of the interval is in the acceptability degree space. A stronger concept is one of\nrefinement. When refining intervals, we seek to determine whether the intervals can be tightened without losing any\npart of the acceptability degree space.\nDefinition 9. Let (cAF = (A,C, I), \u03c3) be a rational pair of constrained argumentation framework and a semantics,\nwe say that CAF' = (A,C, I') is a refinement of cAF (w.r.t. \u03c3) iff (1) for all a \u2208 A, I'(a) \u2286 I(a) and (2) for all\nw : A \u2192 [0, 1] such that for all a \u2208 A, $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(a) \\in I(a)$, then $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(a) \\in I'(\u03b1)$.\nCondition (2) is important and specifies that a refinement only removes unachievable acceptability degrees. A refinement\nthus shrinks intervals while ensuring that any achievable acceptability degrees remain. This means that a refinement can\nonly reduce the upper bound of an interval.\nProposition 2. If (cAF, \u03c3) is rational and cAF' is a refinement of it, then (cAF', \u03c3) is rational.\nProof. Assume that (cAF, o) is rational, then there is a weighting w : A \u2192 [0, 1] such that for all a \u2208 A, $\\sigma_{(A,C,w)}(a) \\in$\nI(a). From the second item of Definition 9, we get that for all a \u2208 A, $\\sigma_{(A,c,w)}(a) \\in I'(a)$. This means that (cAF', \u03c3)\nis rational.\nNext we show an important intermediate result which informs us on the shape of the \"acceptability degree space\" of\nargumentation graphs. We introduce the notion of axial-radiality for a semantics. Intuitively an axial-radial semantics\nremains within the acceptability degree space if moving from a point within the space towards the origin.\""}, {"title": "Definition 10", "content": "A weighted gradual semantics o is said to be obey axial-radiality iff for any argumentation framework\nWAF = (A, C, w), corresponding o\u0251F and a \u2208 A then for all \u025b \u2208 [0,\u03c3AF(a)], ((A, C, I), \u03c3) is rational, where\nI(a) = [\u03c3AF(\u03b1) \u2013 \u03b5, \u03c3AF(a) \u2013 \u025b] and for all b \u2208 A \\ {a}, I(b) = [\u03c3AF(b), AF(b)].\nFor semantics satisfying axial-radiality, the corner points of the hyper-rectangle induced by the intervals over arguments\ncan be used to determine whether the pair CAF/semantics is or is not (fully) rational.\nProposition 3.

Using\naxial-radiality, we conclude that (min(a\u2081), ..., min(an)) is also in the acceptability degree space, contradiction.\nSince one, but not all points, inside the acceptability space, (cAF, \u03c3) is rational but not fully rational.\nItem 3 of Proposition 3 does not mean that there exists a non-trivial refinement. Intuitively, a refinement exists if (at\nleast) an entire face of a cAF lies outside the acceptability degree space and at least one corner point lies within it.\nThis is formalised as follows.\nProposition 4. Let cAF = (A, C, I), A = {a1, ..., an}, a semantics o satisfying axial-radiality, and Z be the set of\nall corner points of the hyper-rectangle induced by I such that (cAF, \u03c3) is rational.

The sketch of the proof is as follows. Let us assume that Xi exists such that none of the points in Xi\nare in the acceptability degree space.

For the weighted h-categorizer, one can go\nfrom the latter to the former using the equation w = X + MAX, where M is the diagonal matrix with the acceptability\ndegrees and A is the adjacency matrix. From this equation, one can check whether a vector of acceptability degrees is\nachievable or not by computing the vector of weights and checking if its values are between 0 and 1.\nConsider an argumentation framework AF = (A, C, w) and corresponding $\\sigma^{Hbs}$, vectors W, X, and matrices M, A.\nNow, take any a \u2208 A and \u03b5\u2208 [0, \u03c3AF(a)] and compute the vector X' where the value at the index corresponding to a\nis updated to \u03c3AF (\u03b1) \u03b5.

Thus, our strategy consists\nof starting at point S and creating a new CAF (with interval function I') whose minimum interval moves along the\nnegation of the gradient until this new CAF is rational, or until min(I'(az)) is equal to 0 (for some i). In the former\ncase, we return the new CAF, while in the latter, we continue moving down while keeping min(I'(ai)) = 0. This\napproach is described in Algorithm 2, which uses the bisection method to efficiently traverse the gradient line. Lines\n1-5 compute the start point of the line (noting that the end point lies at 1). In lines 6-12, we use the bisection method to\nidentify the extreme point where the resultant intervals are rational, taking the possibility of min(I'(a)) being below 0\ninto account (line 8).\nStrategy 2 exhaustively applies Strategy 1 but restricts it so that only the intervals of a subset of arguments X C A\ncan be modified. When all argument subsets have been explored, the cost minimising subset is selected."}, {"title": "4 Evaluation", "content": "To evaluate the strategies from the previous section, we generated 40 Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs for each number of\narguments between 4 and 14, with a 0.5 likelihood for edge creation. For each (A, C), we initialised I s.t., I(a) = [x, 1],\nwhere x is picked randomly from [0.8, 1], ensuring that ((A, C, I), \u03c3) is irrational according to the chosen semantics.\nArgument costs were drawn from the interval [1, 11].\nFigure 6 illustrates the cost for our cost-aware strategies using the weighted h-categorizer, card-based and max-based\nsemantics. For the weighted h-categorizer semantics, Strategy 2 outperforms Strategy 1, while the advantage of the\nformer strategy shrinks for the weighted card-based and max-based semantics as the number of arguments grows.\nFigure 7 plots the total number of arguments modified to achieve minimal cost via Strategy 2. In all cases, the number of\narguments grows linearly. However, we can see that the variance in the number of arguments modified remains large for\nthe weighted h-categorizer, while shrinking for weighted max-based semantics. For the weighted card-based semantics,\nthe variance begins small, and quickly approaches 0 as the number of arguments increases. We hypothesise that the\nexplicit consideration of the number of attacks in weighted-card based semantics reduces the impact of arguments'\ninitial weight on rationality, while the use of only maximally acceptable arguments in max-based semantics causes a\nsimilar effect. The exponential complexity of Strategy 2 makes it unsuitable for large CAFs. Our results suggest that for\nthe weighted card-based and max-based semantics, the impact of using Strategy 1 is small, and that for the weighted\nh-categorizer semantics Strategy 1 performs well."}, {"title": "5 Related work", "content": "In [16], the authors introduce credal support argumentation frameworks where each argument is associated with a credal\nset and an imprecise base score obtained from its credal set. While they only consider a support relation, they show\nhow to compute the imprecise strength of arguments (as an interval) and study theoretical properties. The epistemic\napproach to probabilistic argumentation [17] aims to determine valid probabilities for arguments given some properties,\nsimilar to our intervals. In the context of fuzzy argumentation, legal argument weights can be computed according to\nthe approach of [18]. However, in all these cases, the properties of the interval are not explicitly considered, and neither\nis correcting systems which do not comply with the underlying properties. Enforcement in abstract argumentation (e.g.,\n[19]) considers how argumentation frameworks can be modified to guarantee an argument's status. Our refinements can\nbe viewed similarly in a gradual semantics context."}, {"title": "6 Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "In this paper, we use gradual semantics to help align user beliefs as intervals of acceptability degrees for each argument.\nFrom an initial set of acceptability degree intervals, we introduced refinment (i.e., tighten the bounds of the interval\nwithout losing any valid solutions) and rationalization (i.e., modify bounds to include valid solutions when these were\nnot originally present). The latter was achieved via cost aware heuristics which, while not optimal, perform well\nempirically.\nOur work utilizes weighted gradual semantics and intervals on argument acceptability degrees to elicit initial weights.\nThis can enhance data collection in argumentation graphs, with applications to machine learning training; unlike current\napproaches that depend on synthetic data to represent initial weights, our approach offers a more realistic and potentially\nmore accurate alternative [20"}]}

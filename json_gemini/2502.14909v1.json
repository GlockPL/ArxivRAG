Early and accurate identification of CVD is critical for timely medical intervention, and recent advancements in algorithmic interpretation, particularly those leveraging deep learning techniques [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], have significantly improved the accessibility and accuracy of ECG-based diagnostics. However, these AI-driven approaches primarily rely on digital ECG data, which limits their applicability in real-world clinical settings where paper-based ECGs remain prevalent.\nDespite the increasing availability of digital ECG systems, paper ECGs continue to be widely used due to their historical adoption, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with legacy healthcare infrastructures. The continued reliance on paper ECGs presents significant challenges, as it restricts automated data analysis, complicates electronic health record (EHR) integration, and limits the development of robust AI models trained on diverse ECG data. Consequently, the digitization of paper ECGs is essential for enhancing data accessibility, facilitating large-scale retrospective studies, and reducing the costs associated with CVD diagnosis. Furthermore, an effective digitization pipeline would play a crucial role in expanding telemedicine capabilities, enabling remote diagnosis, and supporting AI-driven advancements in ECG interpretation."}, {"title": "2 The PTB-Image Dataset", "content": "The original PTB dataset [18] was collected using a non-commercial PTB prototype recorder with 16 input channels (14 ECG, 1 respiration, 1 line voltage), an input voltage range of \u00b116 mV (offset compensation up to \u00b1300 mV), 100 Ohm input resistance, and 16-bit resolution (0.5 uV/LSB). Signals were synchronously sampled at 1000 Hz across a 0-1 kHz bandwidth, with noise levels reaching a maximum of 10 uV (pp) or 3 uV (RMS). The dataset comprises 549 records from 290 subjects (ages 17\u201387, mean 57.2), each represented by one to five recordings. Each record includes 15 simultaneous ECG signals: the standard 12-lead ECG (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1\u2212V6) and the three Frank leads (Vx, Vy, Vz), digitized with 16-bit resolution over a \u00b116.384 mV range. Higher sampling rates (up to 10 kHz) may be available upon request. Most records include a. hea file containing clinical summaries with demographic information, diagnoses, and, where applicable, medical history, prescribed medications, coronary artery pathology, ventriculography, echocardiographic findings, and hemodynamic data.\nIn this work, we printed 12 out of the 15 leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1\u2212V6) from each record in the original PTB dataset onto ECG paper using the ECG Image Kit [17]. Given the length of the original ECG signals, only a portion of each signal was printed. Consequently, the original digital records (.dat format) were modified to align with the printed segments, ensuring a valid basis for comparison. After printing, all 549 paper ECGs were scanned to complete the dataset collection."}, {"title": "3 PTB-Image for ECG Digitization", "content": null}, {"title": "3.1 Task Description", "content": "The digitization task aims to convert paper-scanned ECGs into digital time-series signals, enabling automated analysis and integration with electronic health records. Standard paper ECGs typically display all 12 leads in 2.5-second segments, arranged in three rows of four leads each. Additionally, an extended 10-second strip of lead II, V1, V2, or V5 is often included at the bottom . The objective is to accurately extract and reconstruct the 12-lead ECG signals from the scanned images, preserving signal morphology and ensuring compatibility with digital processing techniques. The final output consists of digitally reconstructed 12-lead ECG signals, which can be further utilized for clinical evaluation and algorithmic interpretation."}, {"title": "3.2 Methodology", "content": "In this work, we use VinDigitizer [10], our approach in the Physionet Challenge 2024, for baseline evaluation. VinDigitizer follows a three-stage pipeline, which consists of detecting signal rows on the paper ECG, extracting the signal from the background, and assigning numerical values to each signal point."}, {"title": "3.3 Evaluation Metrics", "content": "For the digitization task, we utilized the following metrics: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), SNR median, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) metric, weighted absolute difference (WAD), and adaptive signed correlation index (ASCI).\nSpecifically, SNR (in dB) is defined as the ratio of the power of the original signal to the power of the noise, which is the difference between the original and the digitized signal:\nSNR = 10 log10 $\\left(\\frac{P_{\\text {original}}}{P_{\\text {original-digitized}}}\\right)$         (1)\nA higher SNR indicates that the digitized signal is closer to the original. If the digitized signal is identical to the original, the SNR is infinity."}, {"title": "3.4 Results", "content": "VinDigitizer was applied to all 549 scanned ECG files from the PTB-Image dataset to convert the printed waveforms back into digital signals. To assess the accuracy of the digitization process, we compared the extracted signals with the corresponding original PTB samples, which had been modified to match the specific portions of the signals that were printed on paper. This ensured a fair and precise evaluation, as the reference signals were aligned with the available printed segments. The signal reconstruction quality was quantified using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), yielding a mean SNR of 0.01 dB across the dataset. This result highlights the challenges associated with extracting clean signals from scanned paper ECGs, including variations in printing quality, scanner-induced distortions, and grid removal artifacts. Despite these challenges, the digitized signals maintained recognizable morphological features, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method for recovering ECG waveforms from paper records."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we introduced PTB-Image, a dataset of scanned paper ECGs paired with their corresponding digital signals, to facilitate research on ECG digitization. To address the challenges of converting printed ECG waveforms back into digital form, we proposed VinDigitizer, a three-stage pipeline comprising signal row detection, background removal, and waveform extraction. Our method was applied to 549 scanned ECGs from PTB-Image, and its performance was evaluated by comparing the reconstructed signals with their original digital counterparts. The results, with a mean SNR of 0.01 dB, highlight both the feasibility and challenges of digitizing paper ECGs, particularly in terms of maintaining signal fidelity amidst printing and scanning artifacts.\nDespite its effectiveness, the current approach has limitations, such as potential distortions introduced during the printing and scanning process, which may affect signal reconstruction accuracy. Future work could explore advanced deep-learning models for robust waveform extraction, improved preprocessing techniques for noise reduction, and domain adaptation methods to enhance generalizability across different paper ECG formats. Additionally, expanding the dataset to include ECGs from various sources and printing conditions would further support the development of more reliable digitization techniques.\nBy making PTB-Image publicly available and providing baseline digitization methods, we aim to encourage further advancements in ECG digitization research, ultimately improving access to historical ECG data and enabling broader applications in telemedicine and automated cardiac diagnostics."}]}

The beam material properties are assumed to vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The methods consider the output of a neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and derive the equations governing beam behavior based on the continuum formulation. The methods are implemented in the framework and formulated by three approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), (b) the energy approach brings about the Deep Energy Method (DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, which results in a class of Neural Operator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the response of the porous beam with functionally graded material under any porosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results are validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions.

This continuous variation offers a range of advantages over homogeneous materials, including the ability to customize properties such as mechanical, thermal, electrical, and magnetic characteristics. Moreover, this refinement reduces thermal stress through gradual variation of thermal expansion coefficients, thereby minimizing the risk of thermal cracking [2]. FGMs also provide thermal protection and corrosion resistance, making them valuable in the aerospace, automotive, and energy industries. Their lightweight design, combined with structural integrity, allows the creation of structures suitable for weight-sensitive applications [3].\nOn the other hand, due to the broad application of beams across diverse fields including civil engineering, marine, military, and aeronautics industries, it is imperative to investigate the mechanical response of beams under different materials and loading conditions. Addressing this demand, beam theories are used to simplify the analysis of complex structures and predict their behavior. The primary goals of various beam theories, such as Classical Beam Theory (CBT), First Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT), and Higher-Order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT), are to reach a balance between precision and efficiency [4]. The fundamental differences between these theories stem from their methods of modeling beam behavior. CBT simplifies the analysis by assuming that the cross-section remains plane and perpendicular to the beam's axis after deformation, neglecting shear deformations. FSDT considers shear deformation effects but assumes constant transverse shear strains across the beam's thickness. In contrast, HSDT accounts for variable transverse shear strains, resulting in a more accurate shear deformation. Significant research has been carried out in this area [5, 6]. Therefore it is of interest to investigate the analysis of FGMs for beams. Numerous studies in the literature also explore the mechanical analysis of FG beams, as evidenced by references [7-12].\nWhile beam theories have their utility in specific scenarios, their effectiveness might be limited when compared to the flexibility, autonomy, and data-driven nature of Machine Learning (ML) approaches in computational mechanics [13, 14]. ML has the potential to revolutionize the field by offering more accurate solutions, particularly for complex and real-world problems [15, 16]. For instance, Ebrahimi and Ezzati [17] studied Young's modulus estimation in functionalized graphene-reinforced nanocomposites using ML. Their findings recommend implementing these models for faster results in engineering applications. Additionally, the research by Ahmed et al. [18] applied ML models (ANN, XGBoost, SVM) to predict shear behavior in ultra-high performance concrete I-shaped beans, where XGBoost exhibited higher accuracy. It highlights the improved accuracy of ML models compared to conventional design methods. Taking advantage of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Mojtabaei et al. [19] successfully predicted elastic critical buckling loads and modal decompositions in thin-walled structural elements, showing their ability to address complicated challenges.\nML finds a wide variety of applications due to its ability to learn patterns from data and then generate the expected output. One significant application of this approach can be found in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) [20-22]. The potential of using deep learning methods to approximate solutions for PDEs was investigated"}, {"title": "2 Formulation", "content": "In general, beam theories have been developed using one of the following two approaches [45]:\n1. Theories relying on the presumed displacement expansions in terms of the powers of the thickness coordinate and unknown functions:\n$\\displaystyle u_i (x, y, z, t) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m}\\left(z\\right)^{j} = 1,2,3$\n(1)\nwhere $u_i (i = 1, 2, 3)$ are total displacement of a point $(x,y,z)$ in the body and are the displacement functions to be determined.\n2. Theories relying on the presumed stress expansions:\n$\\displaystyle \\sigma_{\\epsilon} (x, y, z, t) = \\sum_{j=0}^{m}\\left(z\\right)^{\\alpha}v^{o}_{i} , i = 1, 2, ..., 6$\n(2)\nwhere $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}$ are the stress components $\\sigma_{1} = \\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{2} = \\sigma_{yy}, \\sigma_{3} = \\sigma_{zz}, \\sigma_{4} = \\sigma_{yz}, \\sigma_{5} = \\sigma_{xz}, \\sigma_{6} = \\sigma_{xy}$, and $v^{o}_{i}$ are the stress functions to be determined.\nIn this paper, we define our coordinate system as follows: The x-axis runs along the length of the beam and passes through its geometric centroid. The z-axis is oriented upward, perpendicular to the beam's axis, and the y-axis is directed outward perpendicular to the xz-plane. Our current focus is on bending about the y-axis, and we are developing the framework using displacement expansions. However, it's important to note that this formulation can be extended to stress expansions as well.\nLet the displacement vector be denoted as $\\mathbf{u} = u_x\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x + u_y\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_y +u_z\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$ with $(u_x, u_y, u_z)$ being the component referred to the $(x, y, z)$ coordinates. For bending in the xz-plane (i.e, bending about y axis) the displacement field is:\n$\\mathbf{u}(x, z) = N_x\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_x + N_z\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$\n(3)\nwhere $N_x$ and $N_z$ are the outputs of a Deep Neural Network, $\\mathcal{N}$, which is defined as follows:\n$\\mathcal{N}(x, z; \\theta) = [N_x, N_z] = f^{[L]}(f^{[L-1]}(... f^{[2]}(... f^{[1]}(x, z))))$\n(4)\nwhere $L$ is the number of network layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, $\\Theta$ is network parameters, and $f^{[l]}$ represents the l-th layer of networks as follows:\n$f^{[l]} = A^{[l]} (W^{[l]} * [x, z] +b^{[l]})$\n(5)\n$f^{[l]} = A^{[l]} (W^{[l]} * f^{\\{l-1\\}}+b^{[l]}), l = 2, 3, ..., L$\n(6)\nwhere the weights and biases (network parameters, $\\theta$) of each layer are represented by $W^{[l]}$ and $b^{[l]}$ respectively, for the l-th layer, $A^{[l]}$ is the activation function, and the symbol $*$ is matrix multiplication $(\\cdot)$ for fully connected layers and convolution operation $(*)$ for convolutional layers. Therefore, we can rewrite the displacement field for the beam:\n$\\begin{aligned}u_{x}(x, z) &= N_{x}(x, z; \\theta) \\\nu_{y}(x, z) &= 0 \\\\u_{z}(x, z) &= N_{z}(x, z; \\theta)\\end{aligned}$\n(7)\nIn addition, the measure of strain in solid mechanics is the Green-Lagrange strain tensor defined by [46]\n$\\mathbf{E}=\\frac{1}{2} [\\nabla \\mathbf{u}+(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^\\mathsf{T}+\\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\cdot(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^\\mathsf{T}]$\n(8)\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the gradient operator with respect to material coordinates $\\mathbf{X}$ in the reference configuration:\n$\\nabla=\\hat{E}_{1}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{1}}+\\hat{E}_{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{2}}+\\hat{E}_{3}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_{3}}$\n(9)\nwhere $(\\hat{E}_{1}, \\hat{E}_{2}, \\hat{E}_{3})$ are the unit base vectors in the coordinate system $(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3})$. In the analysis of beams, the deformations are relatively small $(X_{i} \\approx x_{i})$ but there are significant rotations about the y-axis. This means that the"}, {"title": "2.1 Vector Approach - Physics-Informed Neural Networks", "content": "The fundamental principle of linear momentum balance, when applied to a deformed solid continuum and expressed in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor S is given by the equation:\n$\\nabla \\cdot [\\mathbf{S} \\cdot (\\mathbf{I}+\\nabla \\mathbf{u})] + \\mathbf{f} = 0$\n(22)\nwhere $\\nabla$ represents the gradient operator with respect to the material coordinate X and $\\mathbf{f}$ represents the body force per unit volume in the undeformed body.

It is derived as a specific instance of the principle of virtual displacement, provided that the constitutive relations can be derived from a potential function. In this context, we focus our analysis on materials that permit the presence of a strain energy potential, allowing the stress to be derived from it. These materials are commonly referred to as hyperelastic.\nThe principle of minimum total potential energy is a statement of the fact that the energy of the system is the minimum only at its equilibrium configuration. On the other hand, given the fact that the training process in machine learning can be regarded as a process of minimizing the loss function, it seems natural to regard the energy of the system as a very good candidate for this loss function.\nThe total potential energy is defined as follows:\n$\\Pi = U + V_E$\n(33)"}, {"title": "2.3 Data-Driven Approach - Neural Operator", "content": "Neural Networks, which are discussed in the sections 2.1 and 2.2, in fact, have been designed to learn mappings between coordinates of points in the domain into the displacement vector for a specific problem, with determined boundary conditions. The concept of Neural Operators represents a significant extension of traditional neural network development, by learning operators, that map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Hence, Neural Operators can address a range of problems instead of being limited to a singular one, offering a computationally efficient solution.

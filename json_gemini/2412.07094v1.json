With utility of multi-view sensing and multi-node joint transmission, cell-free is a promising technique to realize this prospect. This paper aims to tackle the problem of access point (AP) deployment in cell-free systems to balance the sensing accuracy and user rate. By merging the D-optimality with Euclidean criterion, a novel integrated metric is proposed to be the objective function for both max-sum and max-min problems, which respectively guarantee the overall and lowest performance in multi-user communication and target tracking scenario. To solve the corresponding high dimensional non-convex multi-objective problem, the Soft actor-critic (SAC) is utilized to avoid risk of local optimal result. Numerical results demonstrate that proposed SAC-based APs deployment method achieves 20% of overall performance and 120% of lowest performance.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to become a key usages scenario of the future six-th generation (6G) networks, which is mentioned in newest recommendation concerned with framework and objective of future network of the International Telecommunication Union [10]. Telecommunication base stations, as a widely deployed infrastructure, can significantly enhance situational awareness when equipped with radar sensing capabilities, enabling a variety of novel applications, such as low-altitude drone intrusion detection and accurate virtual environment construction for digital twins [12]. Moreover, as wireless communication networks continue to evolve towards higher frequency bands, more spectrum resources can be obtained to satisfy the high bandwidth requirements of sensing functions. However, high-frequency signals with poor diffraction and high attenuation, makes traditional single station sensing performance significantly limited to shadow effects of obstructions.\nCell-free networks [9, 14], an innovative architecture for 6G networks, may tackle this issue. Unlike conventional cellular networks, where each user equipment (UE) is served by a single base station within a designated cell, cell-free networks deploy a large number of distributed access points (APs) that collaboratively serve all users within the area. Widely-spread APs connected to a central processing unit (CPU) enable seamless sensing and ubiquitous coverage by use of key techniques such as dynamic user association and"}, {"title": "2 ISAC SIGNAL MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION", "content": "As illustrated in Fig. 1, we consider a cell-free ISAC system consists of M single-antenna transmitter APs and N single-antenna receiver APs which collaboratively serve K single-antenna UEs and estimate position of one target moving with specific trajectory.

The configuration of DRL Model is show in Table 1. In our cell-free systems, the target moves along a predefined circular trajectory, while three UEs distributed around the target follow Gaussian distributions with a variance of 2. During sensing tasks, receiving APs capture echoes transmitted from transmitting AP, reflected from the target. During communication tasks, all APs jointly receive uplink signals from all UEs.\nAs shown in Fig. 3, in cell-free ISAC systems, the final convergence result of our proposed SAC-based algorithm significantly surpasses other traditional DRL algorithms in both max-min and max-sum problem. Also, SAC is more stable under different random seeds compared with other algorithms. The hyperparameters of DDPG and TD3 exert a profound impact on their performance, typically, for a complex optimization problem, finding hyperparameters that enable them to exceeds the performance of SAC is challenging. According to the data in Table 2, an increase in the number of APs is observed to correlate positively with improved ISAC performance, thereby significantly demonstrating the pronounced advantage of the cell-free systems in this regard.\nTo be more specific, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 depict the APs deployment results of the cell-free ISAC systems using different algorithms in max-sum and max-min problems. According to the D-optimal criterion, optimal sensing performance is achieved when the positions of transmitting APs and receiving APs lie on a straight line and form specific angles with the target. According to the Euclidean distance criterion derived from zero-forcing reception, communication performance improves as APs approach to UEs. SAC-based APs deployment result satisfies both sensing and communication criterion well. Furthermore, APs deployment in max-min problem in Fig. 5(a) shows that to ensure fairness in service among UEs, each UE is surrounded by several nearby APs to achieve higher SNR. In contrast, in the deployment result of the max-sum problem in Fig. 4(a), all APs are concentrated around the UEs closest to the optimal sensing position.\nTable 3 illustrates the communication and sensing values under optimal APs deployment in different objective functions.

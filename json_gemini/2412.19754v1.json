How AI increases the demand for human skills", "authors": ["Elina M\u00e4kel\u00e4", "Fabian Stephany"], "abstract": "The question of whether the effects of AI are to substitute or complement human work is central to debates on the future of work. This paper examines the impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) on the demand and compensation for skills in the U.S. economy. This research marks a contribution to the field in its investigation of both internal (within-job substitution and complementation) and external (substitution and complementation across occupations, industries and regions) effects, utilising a large dataset of 12 million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2023. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant increase in demand for skills identified as complementary to AI technologies (digital literacy, team work, or resilience and agility), alongside a rising premium for these skills within AI roles such as Data Scientist. Conversely, skills that are considered substitutes for AI, such as customer service, summarisation or text review, have declined both in popularity and value within AI-related positions. Expanding our analysis to measure the external effects across the broader economy, we find a significant increase in demand for complementary skills outside of AI roles but which can be linked to the growth of Al roles within those occupations, industries, or regions. In parallel, there is a moderate decline in the demand for non-AI roles that involve substitute skills across occupations, industries and regions that can be linked to AI. Finally, we estimate that AI has led to a net positive demand, since the complementary effect is up to 50% larger than the substitution effect. We can replicate our results for the UK and Australia. These findings underscore the profound and widespread impact of AI on the evolving skill requirements in the workforce, and suggest reskilling efforts not just prioritise technical AI skills but also AI-complementary skills such as ethics or digital literacy.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Recent technological advancements and their adoption have significant implications for labour markets (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2021; Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020b; Autor et al., 2003; Bessen, 2019; Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014; Frank et al., 2019). Much of prior work has focused on investigating automation potential and has accrued significant evidence for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for substitution of routine cognitive and manual skills (e.g., Autor et al., 2003; Autor & Dorn, 2013). More recent evidence has further suggested that these effects now extend to non-routine cognitive tasks that have traditionally been the realm of highly educated and highly paid workers (Boussioux et al., 2024; Geerling et al., 2023; Girotra et al., 2023; Kung et al., 2023). Conversely, a smaller body of literature has shown evidence for augmentation effects such as improved productivity or efficiency for human workers in analytical, programming or writing tasks (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020b; Dell'Acqua et al., 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023) or new complementation effects such higher demand or valuation for specific skills used alongside AI (Alekseeva et al., 2021; Stephany & Teutloff, 2024). In sum, there exists little consensus regarding what skills AI systems excel in, and consequently little agreement regarding specific expected labour market outcomes (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017). This research seeks to shed light on the nature of AI-driven labour market effects - with particular emphasis on these less-understood complementation effects \u2013 and the dynamics of how and where these changes occur.\nIn order to balance the benefits and concerns associated with \"AI at work\" (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023), researchers, policymakers, employers and job-seekers alike require better, empirically-grounded, understanding of these important effects. To date, however, much prior work has had a speculative forecasting approach (e.g., Agrawal et al., 2019; Webb, 2019) and relied on expert opinions or theoretical models for making claims, where the underlying assumptions may not be validated nor broadly accepted (Yilmaz et al., 2023). This may limit the practical applicability of these works for policymakers seeking to inform better labour market policy, employers seeking to engage in strategic workforce planning, and job-seekers seeking to improve their employment prospects. In addition, perhaps given the very recent step change in AI adoption (McKinsey, 2023; World Economic Forum, 2023), there have thus far been \"substantially fewer\" studies examining AI (Brynjolfsson et al, 2023: 4) compared to those investigating the effects of other technologies. Building on prior work demonstrating a strong association between technology adoption and changes in skills demands (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2021), and following the tenets of skill-biased technological change theory, we assume that artificial intelligence might lead to both complementing and substituting certain skills.\nGathering empirical evidence to measure the effects of technology on labour markets is not easy (Frank et al., 2019). Following Acemoglu et al (2021) and Deming and Noray (2020), we assume that changes in demand for and valuation of skills can be observed from the \u2018footprints' left by job vacancy postings as employers communicate their evolving skills demands and their willingness to pay for specific skills. This study leverages a dataset of around 12 million (n=11,729,662) online job vacancy postings from the United States spanning a period of January 2018 to December 2023. Scraped from over 65,000 websites globally, including national and local job boards, company career pages, and job vacancy aggregators (Lightcast Data, n.d.), these postings cover the \u201cnear-universe\" of online vacancies (Acemoglu et al., 2021, p.1). In what follows, our paper begins with a question at the forefront of the minds of both economists and policymakers-whether AI technologies are leading to substitution (reducing work) or complementation (increasing demand for specific types of work).\nTurning to our findings, in the first part of the paper we first show a rise in demand for AI roles in the data, that is stronger than the general increase in labour demand. Next, we reveal a significant increase in demand for skills identified as complementary to AI technologies, such as digital literacy, team work, or resilience and agility, alongside a rising premium for these skills within AI roles, such as data scientists. Conversely, skills that are considered substitutable by AI, like customer service, summarisation or text review, have declined both in popularity and value within AI-related positions. Finally, we take a deeper look at complementary skills and show that for some skills, both the demand and the premium are more pronounced, that certain combinations of AI skills and complementary skills are more popular, and that there exists a compounding effect of complementary skills where combinations of specific complementary skills may be both more popular and profitable. We further illustrate this with specific AI roles, such as data scientists, to exemplify the compounding effect of complementary skills.\nIn the second half of this paper, we turn to expanding our analysis to measure the external effects across the broader economy, showing that AI impacts complementary and substitute skills even outside AI roles. Centrally, we find statistically significant external effects at the occupation, industry, and regional level. Specifically, growth in Al roles is associated with increased demand for non-AI complementary roles and a decline in demand for non-AI substitutable roles. Importantly, we find that the complementarity effect is considerably larger than the substitution effect. We repeat this analysis for the UK and Australia confirming the robustness of our findings. Finally, we conclude and discuss implications for stakeholders."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "The question of whether AI is used to complement or substitute human labour is a central debate in the literature. Technological advancements have continually reshaped labour markets, from the mechanisation of the Industrial Revolution to contemporary digital transformations, each has redefined the skills required in the workforce and transformed the economic landscape (Frey, 2019; Goldin & Katz, 2007b; Schwab, 2017). First, the Industrial Revolution marked a significant shift as production was mechanised and modernised, creating new manufacturing jobs, dramatically altering workforce structures, catalysing urbanisation and population growth and reshaping the economic foundations of society (Stearns, 2020). Second, the 20th century saw rapid scientific progress, electrification and the emergence of automation technologies for industry standardisation and mass production, particularly in manufacturing where robotics began to undertake tasks previously performed by humans (Xu et al., 2018). This era saw the displacement of some routine jobs but also the expansion of the service sector, which offered new employment opportunities (Urquhart, 1984). These transitions illustrate the dual effects of technology on labour markets both destructive and generative. Thirdly, the \u201cInformation Age\" (e.g., Castells, 1997; Heeks, 1999), underpinned by the development of semiconductors and computing technologies (Bresnahan & Trajtenberg, 1995) saw sources of productivity, innovation and competitiveness in the economy increasingly depend on information technology (Castells, 1997).\nFinally, recent technological advancement and adoption, also labelled the \"fourth industrial revolution\u201d, have continued to reshape labour markets as machines are used for increasingly complicated tasks through a combination of AI, increased computing power and connectivity, and cyber-physical systems such as IoT (e.g., Autor et al., 1998; Schwab, 2017). Subsequent literature has investigated the impacts of such technologies on employment and wages, especially on routine manual and cognitive tasks (e.g. Autor et al., 2003; Bessen, 2019; Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). Though some research has provided evidence for positive impacts, such as improved productivity (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020b) or reorientation to \u201cmeaningful\" work tasks (Parmer, 2023) much of the literature warns of its risks or negative effects. These include wage inequality (Autor et al., 1998; Krueger, 1993), (risks of) worker displacement through automation (e.g., Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2020a; Frey & Osborne, 2017), and employment polarisation or a \u201chollowing-out\" of the labour market as these changes differently effect high- and low-skilled workers (e.g., Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). Though \u201cthe periodic warning that automation and new technologies are going to replace large numbers of jobs is a recurring theme in economic literature\" (Stephany & Teutloff, 2024 p.2), the growing volume of studies on these risks of new technologies to equitable labour markets underscores the importance of research into changes in employment and wages in an context of current technological changes - especially with the recent step-change in artificial intelligence development and adoption (McKinsey, 2023; World Economic Forum, 2023)."}, {"title": "Understanding AI's Impact on Skills and Work", "content": "However, studies on the labour market effects of artificial intelligence on skills are substantially fewer in number (Acemoglu et al., 2021; Brynjolfsson et al., 2023), with some notable recent exceptions. For example, a Science-published experimental study found evidence of (generative) AI augmentation of human workers for writing tasks (Noy & Zhang, 2023) and another experiment conducted by Harvard researchers at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group found evidence of augmentation in select knowledge work tasks (Dell'Acqua et al., 2023). Meanwhile, Grennan and Michaely find evidence of AI substitution effects on security analysts, with consequences for employment and compensation (Grennan & Michaely, 2020), and Bessen et al show that over 50% of AI startups claim to automate routine work and decrease labour expenses for clients (Bessen et al., 2023), suggesting a tension between evidence for augmentation and automation effects, and underscoring the importance of untangling these important effects.\nThis question of whether the effects of AI are to substitute or complement human work is central to debates on the future of work. An initial wave of occupation-based research focused on the automation of entire occupations (e.g., Bessen, 2016). This approach was instrumental in initiating early debates on the impacts of technology on employment, but has been criticised for its treatment of occupations as homogeneous entities, which risks simplifying complex dynamics occurring within occupations (Frank et al., 2019). Subsequent waves applied a task-based approach (e.g., Arntz et al., 2016; Autor et al., 2003; Autor & Handel, 2013) which focuses on evidence for augmentation or automation of specific tasks within occupations. For example, formal reasoning tasks within Professional, Managerial, and Technical occupations (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011).\nFinally, the skills-based approach (e.g., Acemoglu & Autor, 2011) suggests that the susceptibility of automation and augmentation of a role is defined by its skills. Proponents of the skills-based approach argue that as skills are used to perform tasks and occupations are best understood as bundles of skills, this approach is both intuitive and powerful in reducing any risk of over-simplifying complex dynamics (Autor et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2019; Stephany & Teutloff, 2024)."}, {"title": "Substitution, Augmentation, and Skill Complementarities in the AI Era", "content": "Prior work has accrued significant evidence for the use of AI for automation or substitution of routine cognitive and manual skills (e.g., Autor et al., 2003; Autor & Dorn, 2013). A smaller body of more recent evidence suggests that artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), can be used to generate human-level analytical, problem-solving, decision-making, creative, and writing output (Boussioux et al., 2024; Girotra et al., 2023) including passing economics and medical licensing examinations (Geerling et al., 2023; Kung et al., 2023) non-routine cognitive tasks that have traditionally been the realm of highly educated and highly paid workers (Dell'Acqua et al., 2023).\nYet, other recent work has claimed that AI can be used to augment knowledge work. This can include improving efficiency or accuracy for skills such as analytical, programming or writing skills (Dell'Acqua et al., 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023; Noy & Zhang, 2023) or creating demand for new skills (Bessen, 2016). Others have found evidence for higher demand or valuation for specific skills used alongside AI (Alekseeva et al., 2021; Stephany & Teutloff, 2024), suggesting that complementarities exist between AI skills and other skills. Such skill complementarities have received growing research attention, for example, in measuring skill synergies via their co-occurrence in job requirements (Anderson, 2017), observing complementarities (and substitutions) of knowledge in the semiconductor industry as measured through patent specifications (Dibiaggio et al., 2014), and investigating of how clustering of complementary skills is driving persistent workforce polarisation and economic inequality (Alabdulkareem et al., 2018). As Neffke (2019) concludes, collectively this body of research underscores that skills and technological expertise are inherently interlinked via interdependencies among skill or knowledge elements.\nIt is important to note that there are two ways to look at complementation and substitution: popularity (how much this type of work is in demand) and valuation (how much this type of work is being valued). For instance, some research suggests that while substitution of work may not be observable in demand changes, it could be evident in devaluation. For example, Goldin and Katz' seminal work on wages in the United States links wage differentials to skill-biased technological change (Goldin & Katz, 2007a), and Bessen links computerised occupations with \u201csubstantially greater\" wage inequality (Bessen, 2016, p.1) .\nIn sum, there is no consensus regarding what skills AI systems excel in, and thus no consensus on specific expected labour market outcomes (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017). In fact, it is most likely that substitution and complementation effects co-exist and that AI adoption is associated with both a decline in demand and valuation for some skills, as well as increasing demand for related skills or new skills (Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018b; Autor et al., 2003). As succinctly explained by Acemoglu et al:\n\u201c...if different tasks require different skills, then the adoption of AI technologies may also change the set of skills that exposed establishments demand (and list in their vacancies). Skills relevant for tasks now performed by algorithms will be demanded less frequently, and new skills necessary for working alongside AI algorithms may also start being included in vacancies\u201d (Acemoglu et al., 2021, p.8)"}, {"title": "Unresolved Questions in AI's Skill Impacts", "content": "Finally, scholars have drawn attention to two key shortcomings of prior work. Firstly, while this literature review has sought to refer only to studies that adhere to the highest standards in research design, there is a large portion of the literature (as well as public press) that relies on theoretical models, expert opinions and predictions for their claims, where the underlying assumptions may not be validated nor broadly accepted (Yilmaz et al., 2023). Much prior work on the impact of AI seeks to forecast substitution effects on these bases (e.g., Agrawal et al., 2019; Webb, 2019), with vastly varying magnitudes and directions in these forecasts. This approach may introduce bias for at least two reasons even among experts there exists no widely shared consensus on the skill-complementing or skill-substituting effects of AI (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017; Frank et al., 2019), and even experts underestimate the variety of skills deployed within occupations, which may cause over- or underestimations (Arntz et al., 2016). Gathering empirical evidence to generate and prove hypotheses is not easy as explained by Frank, Autor, Bessen, Brynjolfsson and others, \"major barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI on the future of work include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations) [and] lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human-machine complementarity)\u201d (Frank et al., 2019, p.6531).\nSecond, and relatedly, there is little consensus regarding what skills AI systems excel in or expected labour market outcomes (e.g., Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2018b; Autor et al., 2003; Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017), with fierce debates as to which skills, tasks and occupations are affected by AI, in what ways, and to what extent. The strongest evidence points to complex dual substitution and complementation effects, with diminishing demand for substitution of skills now executable by AI and increasing demand for skills required for working in combination with AI (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2021).\nBuilding on prior work which has demonstrated a strong association between technology adoption and changes in skills demands (Acemoglu et al., 2021) and mindful of the shortcomings laid out above, this paper seeks to extend our understanding of this emerging and important field of research. In light of these unresolved questions and the critical need for empirical evidence, this study seeks to determine whether the growing demand for AI-related work not only reshapes skill requirements within AI-intensive roles but also exerts a broader influence on associated labor markets. More specifically, we ask: Does the increasing demand for AI work enhance the demand and valuation of skills that complement AI, both within AI-focused positions and in their surrounding ecosystems of related occupations, industries, and regions?"}, {"title": "Hypotheses", "content": "It is clear that the growing integration of AI technologies into various facets of economic activity has important implications for the skill sets demanded in the labor market. We conceptualize these implications as arising through both \"internal\" and \"external\" effects on skill requirements. Internal effects refer to changes in skill demands within AI-intensive roles, while external effects describe how AI influences skill requirements beyond strictly AI-focused occupations, extending to other workers within an occupation, across competing firms in an industry, and even across entire regions.\nWithin roles that directly engage with AI-such as data scientists or machine learning engineers-the advent of increasingly complex and opaque models alters the bundle of skills needed for effective job performance. For example, when working with advanced AI algorithms that produce outcomes less readily interpretable than conventional statistical models, these workers must now possess stronger ethical reasoning skills to identify and mitigate potential biases and broader unintended consequences. Similarly, heightened emphasis on algorithmic accountability and interpretability may demand more substantial digital literacy, along with softer skills like resilience and adaptability. In economic terms, these internal effects can be understood as cross-derivative complementarities at the worker's own \u201cproduction function\" level. Here, the productivity of the individual worker\u2014the \u201coutput\"-is determined by multiple skill inputs, and the marginal benefit of one skill (e.g., ethics) increases as another skill (e.g., AI technical proficiency) becomes more central. Thus, as the prevalence of AI-based tasks expands, the cross-partial derivatives of the worker-level production function become positive, indicating that the presence of AI skills enhances the return to these complementary non-technical skills.\nBeyond the core set of AI specialists, skill demands are influenced externally through spillover effects that affect other workers in the same occupation, competing firms within an industry, and broader economic regions. At the occupational level, even workers who do not interface directly with AI may need higher digital literacy or a fundamental understanding of algorithmic outputs. This ensures their ability to interpret, validate, and act upon AI-driven insights produced by colleagues in similar roles. At the industry level, when rival firms adopt AI technologies, competitive pressures may lead firms without a direct AI focus to invest in raising the overall technical proficiency of their workforce. Improving employees' teamwork, resilience, and ethical understanding can further complement technology adoption, allowing these firms to respond nimbly and responsibly to AI-driven market changes. The positive cross-derivatives here operate at the firm's production function level, where the presence of an AI-intensive competitor increases the marginal productivity of complementary skills within non-AI roles.\nAt the regional level, the spatial clustering of AI capabilities can produce broad-based skill shifts. In regions hosting AI hubs-think of areas specializing in autonomous driving or AI-driven recruitment practices-spillover effects transcend firm or industry boundaries. Local labor pools adapt as a whole; non-AI workers in the region may benefit from digital upskilling and an enhanced understanding of AI's ethical and social implications. Conceptually, this can be modeled through a \u201cregional production function,\" where the complementarities extend beyond firm-level interactions and involve multiple employers, educational institutions, and related services. As AI permeates the regional economy, the marginal value of digital literacy, teamwork, resilience, and ethics skills rises across a variety of roles, reflecting positive cross-partial derivatives that span geographic boundaries.\nTo guide our investigation, we propose a set of hypotheses reflecting the \"internal\" and \"external\" effects of AI's diffusion on skill demand.\n*   Hla: Roles that require AI skills also exhibit a higher demand for skills that complement AI.\n*   H1b: Complementary skills within AI-intensive roles command higher wages.\n*   H1c: Roles that require AI skills show reduced demand for skills considered substitutes for AI.\n*   H2a: In regions, industries, or occupations characterized by high AI adoption, non-AI roles exhibit increased demand for complementary skills.\n*   H2b: In these same contexts, non-AI roles show a decrease in demand for substitute skills.\nIn sum, our approach integrates both \"within-role\" and \"beyond-role\" perspectives to capture the multifaceted nature of AI's labor market impact. By examining how complementary and substitute skills evolve both inside and outside of AI-heavy contexts, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the ways in which technological change influences not only immediate job requirements but also the broader ecosystems of talent and expertise."}, {"title": "Methods and Data", "content": "Following prior work, we assume that changes in demand for and valuation of skills can be observed from the 'footprints' left by job vacancy postings as employers communicate their evolving skills demands and their willingness to pay for specific skills (Acemoglu et al., 2021; Deming & Noray, 2020). This study leverages a dataset of around 12 million (n=11,729,662) online job vacancy postings in the United States from January 2018 to December 2023, provided by the Burning Glass Institute (BGI). The BGI is a global leader in labour market analytics and collects these postings by scraping over 65,000 online sources, including national and local job boards, company career pages, and job vacancy aggregators (Lightcast Data, n.d.), to cover the \u201cnear-universe\u201d of online vacancies (Acemoglu et al., 2021, p.1). Each posting includes information on e.g., title, occupation category, salary, and a detailed list of skills demanded for the position, which have been scraped from the text of the posting and organised according to around a thousand standardised labels.\nNoteworthy prior research has made use of BGI data for understanding the effects of technology on the labour market (e.g., Alekseeva et al., 2021; Acemoglu et al., 2021; Ehlinger & Stephany, 2023; Hazell & Taska, 2020; Babina et al., 2024; Hershbein & Kahn, 2018). A key question raised (and addressed) in these works concerns the representativeness of online job vacancy data, leading me to conduct numerous tests to interrogate the representativeness of my data.\nAcemoglu, Autor, Hazell and Restrepo (Acemoglu et al., 2021) have demonstrated that BGI data closely mirror the trends in overall job vacancies in the United States, as reported by the Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Job Openings, and that its industry composition is closely aligned with industry-level vacancy statistics from JOLTS.\nIn addition, we further find that my dataset is closely aligned with key BLS statistics on job openings by state from the JOLTS and occupational composition from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) Survey (see Appendix Tables 1-2). There is extremely little divergence in the state level-statistics and some divergence in the occupation category level statistics, such as overrepresentation of Computer and Mathematical Occupations and underrepresentation of Farming, Fishing, and Forestry Occupations. As highlighted by Carnevale et al (2014), this is characteristic of online vacancy postings data, which can overrepresent professional and technical occupations relative to blue collar occupations. However, overall, the BGI data is satisfactorily representative \u2013 the average difference compared to BLS statistics is only 3%. Moreover, due the focus of the research in comparing shares rather than absolute figures, and on knowledge work occupations, the impact of over- or under-representation is likely to be small.\nTo define the complementary and substitutable skills for the analysis, we turned to literature. This review (e.g., Autor et al, 2008; Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Frey & Osborne, 2017; Autor et al., 2003; Wirtz et al., 2018; Felten et al, 2019; Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2019; Frank et al 2019; Colombo et al 2019) yielded five substitutable skills (clusters), which we labelled Basic Data Skills, Summary and Reporting, Language and Text Review, Customer Service and Office and Financial Administration, and seven complementary skills (clusters), which we labelled Analytical Thinking, Digital Literacy, Resilience and Agility, Technical Proficiency, Ethics, Self-Efficiency, and Working With Others. See Appendix Table 3 for literature per individual skills cluster.\nNext, to ensure successful operationalisation of the research, we set out to verify which skills are covered by our BGI dataset, and identify skills that would be the closest match with those found in the literature review. To do so, we extracted a list of unique skills from the data and mapped these skills to those described in the literature. This yielded 18 individual skills from the BGI database to make up the 5 substitutable skills clusters (see Appendix Table 4) and 71 individual skills from the BGI database to make up the 7 complementary skills clusters (Appendix Table 5). The final criteria for inclusion were (1) referenced in at least two high-quality publications, (2) have equivalent skills (same or sufficiently similar) in the data, (3) have a minimum sample size of n=30 job vacancies demanding that skill in the BGI dataset, a common threshold for statistical analysis (Heumann et al., 2016).\nWe label a posting as demanding complementary or substitutable skills if it demands at least one skill from the complementary or substitutable skills list. The justification for this twofold, both conceptual and practical. Firstly, the conceptual justification for this choice is clear for example, job postings requiring \"Critical Thinking\" or \"Digital Literacy\" are both postings demanding complementary skills, irrespective of whether the job posting requires both those skills. Demand for at least one complementary or substitutable skill should be considered indication that that job is related to complementary or substitutable skills utilisation, and can be classified as such. In addition, some skills clusters contain only 1-2 equivalent BGI skills, such as Customer Service (\u201ccustomer service", "ethical standards and conduct, business ethics\"), meaning these important skills categories would be eliminated from the analysis entirely were a higher threshold used. Secondly, as shown in Appendix Figures 1-2, the number of postings able to be included in the analysis would decline rapidly if a higher threshold of minimum two or more complementary or substitutable skills were to be applied.\nTo identify AI roles we use a skills-based approach, following the example of numerous researchers who apply this approach for understanding the effects of artificial intelligence jobs in the labour market (e.g. Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Alekseeva et al., 2021; Ehlinger & Stephany, 2023). The approach uses skills required for a job for classification \u2013 thus a job vacancy posting that lists skill(s) to create or use AI as a requirement is considered to be an Al role. This avoids categorising vacancies in AI companies or the AI industry that are not truly AI roles (e.g. a Human Resources Manager at an AI company) as AI roles.\nIn line with the skills-based approach, in order to identify AI roles we first needed to identify AI skills. Not all AI roles are the same, and interesting variations are likely to exist across different categories of AI roles. To identify and classify subcategories of AI roles, we first leveraged BGI's existing classification of AI roles into those using 'AI User' or 'AI Creator' skills (n=115 skills). Next, taking these 115 skills, we further classified each into a subcategory, consulting literature (e.g., Russell & Norvig, 2016; Squicciarini & Nachtigall, 2021) where our existing knowledge was not sufficient for classification. Any skill that was unclear or broadly phrased was verified to ensure its correct classification by rank-ordering and printing a list of occupations demanding that skill (at the highest specificity, SOC_5 level) to better understand its applications. For example, \u201cChatGPT": "initially classified as Natural Language Processing (NLP) in AI Creators was re-classified as NLP AI Users after the check showed that this skill was predominantly deployed by \u201cwriters and editors\" and \"sales managers\" who are more likely to be users than creators of AI. Finally", "categories)": "n1.  Machine learning creators\n2.  Natural language processing (NLP) creators\n3.  AI development and operations\n4.  Computer vision and image processing\n5.  Prediction and analytics\n6.  Machine learning users\n7.  Natural language processing (NLP) users\n8.  AI Applications and Tools\nSimilarly to the complementary and substitutable skills classification", "Generative Adversarial Networks": "r \u201cLarge Language Modeling\" are both Al role postings", "formula": "nPercentage Difference = \\frac{(V_2-V_1)}{V_1} \u00d7 100\nwhere V1 and V2 are the initial and final values, respectively.\nSalary data can be skewed, which could affect the results of statistical analyses. Therefore, before undertaking our salary analyses, we conducted some tests to validate if the salary variable requires transformation before its use in the analysis. A visual inspection of a histogram and Q-Q plot (see Appendix Figure 4) showed that the distribution of salary is right-skewed and the Q-Q plot is deviated from the line. Thus, to stabilise the variance, making it more suitable for my analysis, we log-transform (natural logarithm) the salary variable.\nIn what follows, we first conduct a time series analysis to display trends and compare demand and salary patterns over time. This is an important step in setting the scene for the analysis, before answering the main research questions. First, we compare demand for complementary and for substitutable skills in AI roles compared to non-AI roles over the years 2018-2023. We begin by filtering data to include only knowledge work occupations as this is the focus of this paper, and because it provides a fairer comparison point than blue-collar occupations such as manufacturing or agriculture which are significantly less likely to demand skills such as office administration or technical proficiency. The share of postings demanding complementary and substitutable skills was calculated as a percentage of the total postings (for AI/non-AI), and visually presented over the years 2018-2023 using a line chart. In the second part of the analysis, we repeat this process for salary, comparing log salary for AI roles demanding complementary and for substitutable skills and non-AI roles with these skills over time.\nRegression as a method of analysis has an established precedent of being used to understand the relationships between artificial intelligence and patterns in"}]}

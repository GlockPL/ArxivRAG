Introduction", "content": "The performance and longevity of asphalt pavements, critical components of modern transportation infrastructure, are intrinsically linked to the complex interplay of their constituent materials. Aggregate gradation, in particular, plays a pivotal role in determining key properties such as durability, stability, and resistance to deformation. Despite extensive research, the intricate relationships between aggregate gradation and asphalt concrete behavior continue to challenge engineers and researchers in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Current practices in asphalt mixture design rely heavily on empirical methods and experience-based decisions, which often fall short in optimizing mixture performance across diverse environmental conditions and traffic loads.\nThe complexity of interactions between aggregate gradation, binder properties, and external factors makes it challenging to predict pavement performance accurately, leading to suboptimal designs, premature failures, and increased lifecycle costs of transportation infrastructure. While numerous studies have investigated the effects of aggregate gradation on asphalt concrete properties, there remains a significant gap in understanding the complex, non-linear relationships between gradation parameters and pavement performance metrics. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the field of explainable AI (XAI), present unprecedented opportunities to elucidate these complex patterns and relationships. XAI techniques provide interpretable insights into the decision-making processes of Al models, bridging the gap between black-box predictions and actionable engineering knowledge\nThe motivation for using XAI techniques in this study is multifaceted. Firstly, X\u0391\u0399 enhances interpretability, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different gradation parameters influence asphalt concrete performance. Secondly, it improves trust and adoption of Al-driven design processes by making predictions more transparent and explainable. Thirdly, XAI techniques can uncover complex, non-linear relationships between input variables and performance metrics that may not be apparent through traditional analysis methods. Lastly, the insights provided by XAI can guide targeted improvements in mixture design, potentially leading to more efficient and performance-oriented optimization processes\nThis study aims to address these research gaps by integrating the Bailey's method for aggregate gradation analysis with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, a powerful XAI technique.

By addressing the current limitations in asphalt mixture design and leveraging advanced Al techniques, this research aims to bridge the gap between traditional engineering practices and cutting-edge data science, paving the way for the next generation of intelligent transportation systems.\nThis study comprises two primary components: experimental investigation and computational modeling. The experimental phase focused on characterizing the mechanical behavior of asphaltic concrete, specifically its stiffness and rutting resistance, under varying aggregate gradations. Two lithologies, limestone and basalt, were employed to assess the impact of rock type on material properties. Stiffness was quantified via resilience modulus testing, adhering to ASTM D4123 and AASHTO TP 31 protocols. Rutting resistance was evaluated using the Hamburg wheel-tracking (HWT) test, following AASHTO T324 standards. The computational phase involved the development of a predictive model based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. This model was subsequently interpreted using an explainable AI (XAI) framework to elucidate the relationships between input parameters and predicted outcomes. To facilitate practical application, a web-based interface was implemented, integrating the trained model with XAI functionalities. This interface enables civil engineers to utilize advanced Al techniques without requiring in-depth knowledge of machine learning, while also providing interpretable insights into predictions and allowing for iterative optimization of aggregate gradations to achieve desired asphaltic concrete properties. This approach represents a novel integration of Al techniques with domain-specific engineering knowledge, potentially enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asphaltic concrete design processes.\nThe Bailey's method, developed by Robert Bailey of the Illinois Department of Transportation in the 1980s, is a systematic approach to designing and analyzing aggregate gradations in asphalt mixtures. It focuses on understanding and controlling the packing characteristics of aggregates, using specific control sieves to divide the aggregate blend into coarse and fine fractions. The method employs three key ratios Coarse Aggregate Ratio (CA Ratio), Fine Aggregate Coarse Ratio (FAc Ratio), and Fine Aggregate Fine Ratio (FAf Ratio) to evaluate and adjust aggregate gradations. By controlling these ratios within these ranges, the Bailey's method aims to achieve desired volumetric properties and optimize mixture performance, potentially improving properties like rutting resistance and durability. This approach provides engineers with a tool to better understand and control the aggregate structure in asphalt mixtures, offering flexibility to accommodate various aggregate types and mixture requirements. In the context of the research paper discussed, these Bailey's method parameters were used as inputs for the deep learning model, enabling a comprehensive analysis of how gradation characteristics influence asphalt concrete performance metrics such as resilience modulus and dynamic stability."}, {"title": "3. Laboratory testing", "content": "According to the Bailey's method for the design of coarse-grade mixes, various particle sizes are defined using specific control sieve sizes as follows: The Half Sieve (HS) is set at 0.5 times the Nominal Maximum Particle Size (NMPS). The Primary Control Sieve (PCS), which separates coarse aggregate from fine aggregate, is defined as PCS = 0.22 \u00d7 NMPS. The Secondary Control Sieve (SCS) separates the coarse and fine portions of the fine aggregate and is defined as SCS = 0.22 \u00d7 PCS. Additionally, the fine portion of the fine aggregate is further separated using the Tertiary Control Sieve (TCS), defined as TCS = 0.22 \u00d7 SCS.\nThe Coarse Aggregate Ratio (CA Ratio) evaluates the packing of coarse aggregates and resulting void structure. Particles retained on the half sieve (\"interceptors\") and those passing it (\"pluggers\") interact to influence the mixture's volumetric properties. Adjusting the balance of these particles can modify the Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA), potentially optimizing compactability and load performance. The CA Ratio calculation is expressed as follows:\n$CA = \\frac{\\% Passing Half Sieve+\\% Passing PCS}{100\\%-\\%\\ Passing Half Sieve}$ (1)\nThe Fine Aggregate Coarse Ratio (FAc Ratio) examines the aggregate material passing the PCS and retained on the SCS. It evaluates the coarse portion of the fine aggregate, which creates voids to be filled with the fine portion. Proper filling of these voids controls the Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA) and air voids in the mixture.

The final gradation was achieved by blending these bins in different proportions. The NMPS for all bins is 19 mm. Bailey's method, originally developed for coarse-graded mixes, recommends the following ratios for a 19 mm NMPS: a CA Ratio of 0.60-0.75, an FAc Ratio of 0.35\u20130.50, and an FAf Ratio of 0.35\u20130.50 . This study prepared various gradations based on these recommended values by combining the lower, mid-range, and upper bound values for the CA, FAc, and FAf ratios, resulting in 3 \u00d7 3 = 9 combinations, as shown in Table 1.

This target falls within the typical range of 3.0% to 5.0% specified by the Marshall mix design method (NCHRP Report 673, 2011)(National Academies of Sciences,"}, {"title": "3.3. Resilient modulus test", "content": "Engineering, and Medicine 2011). Aggregates for the nine different gradation characteristics were hot-mixed with AC type 60/70, with the AC content varied at five different levels by the dry mass of aggregate, resulting in 5 \u00d7 9 = 45 samples per aggregate type. Each hot mix was then compacted in a Marshall mold with 75 blows per side, as specified in the Marshall test procedure.\nTable 1 lists the AC content values required to achieve an air void (AV) of 4% for each gradation characteristic and aggregate type. It is observed that the AC content at 4% air voids decreases with an increase in the CA, FAc, and FAf ratios. An increase in the FA ratios results in a decrease in air voids, leading to denser packing of the fine aggregates thereby reducing the required AC content. These varying AC contents were used to prepare specimens for the resilient modulus test and the Hamburg wheel-tracking (HWT) test, which will be discussed next. In other words, the results of these tests are compared based on samples with a consistent AV of 4%.\nThe resilient modulus test, performed in accordance with ASTM D4123 and AASHTO TP 31 standards, determines the resilient modulus (Mr) of bituminous mixtures through an indirect tensile test. The test applies a repeated load equal to 15% of the indirect tensile strength (ITS) at a temperature of 35\u00baC, with compressive loads for 160 cycles and a pulse of 100 milliseconds (1-second interval). A cylindrical asphalt concrete specimen is subjected to vertical diametral loading, typically requiring 50 to 200 repetitions. The modulus is calculated as the average of the last five cycles, using lateral deformation measured by a displacement transducer. Mr can be determined as described in Eq. 4.

Due to its larger specimen size (6-inch), the HWT test requires preparation using the Superpave method as per AASHTO T 312. In this study, the samples were prepared with AC content to achieve an air void (AV) of 4%, as described earlier.\nThe Hamburg Wheel-Tracking (HWT) apparatus, widely used in Germany, measures combined rutting and moisture damage by rolling a steel wheel over an asphalt slab submerged in hot water at 50\u00b0C. The steel wheel, with a diameter of 204 mm and a width of 47 mm, generates 53\u00b02 passes per minute. Specimens typically measure 320 mm in length, 260 mm in width, and vary from 40 to 80 mm in thickness. Cylindrical specimens have a diameter of 150 mm and a height of 60\u00b12 mm. The device records rut depth with an accuracy of 0.01 mm and stops automatically when the preset number of passes or a rut depth of 20 mm is reached.\nThe HWT test produces a relationship between rut depth and the number of passes, usually showing two linear portions separated by the Stripping Inflection Point (SIP). The key parameter obtained from this test is the dynamic stability (DS), the ratio of rut depth"}]}, {"title": "4. Deep learning model", "content": "However, the aggregate gradation commonly used by the Department of Highways in Thailand, where this study was conducted, is fine-graded. Therefore, the designed gradation must satisfy not only the CA, FAc, and FAf ratios for coarse-graded mixes but also the new ratios for fine-graded mixes to properly control the fine portion. The new control sieve sizes are defined as follows: the new NMPS is the original PCS; the new HS is 0.5 \u00d7 new NMPS; the new PCS is 0.22 \u00d7 new NMPS; the new SCS is 0.22 \u00d7 new PCS; and the TCS is 0.22 \u00d7 new SCS. Table 3.6 also lists the new CA, FAc, and FAf ratios for fine-graded mixes based on the specified ratios for coarse-graded mixes.\nIn this study, the NMPS is 19 mm (3/4\" sieve). For coarse-graded mixes, the HS is 9.5 mm (3/8\" sieve), the PCS is 4.75 mm (#4 sieve), the SCS is 1.18 mm (#16 sieve), and the TCS is 0.3 mm (#50 sieve).

Table 2 summarizes these original and new control sieve sizes for both coarse- and fine-graded mixes, along with the percent finer for each sieve size across the nine specified gradation characteristics.\nThis research focuses on developing an advanced predictive model for key properties of asphaltic concrete, namely resilience modulus (MR) and dynamic stability (DS), which are crucial for pavement performance.

Implemented in Python using the PyTorch library, the network expands from 14 input features through successive hidden layers of 200, 1000, 200, 20, and 5 neurons, before converging to a single output neuron. This expansion-contraction structure enhances feature extraction capabilities. Each neuron connects to the subsequent layer via a weight matrix and bias term, following the equation:\n$y = Wx + b$ (5)\nWe apply the Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (LeakyReLU (Xu et al. 2015)) function as the activation function following each perceptron layer, defined as:\n$f(x) = \\begin{cases}x \\text{ if } x > 0 \\\\0.01x \\text{ if } x < 10\\end{cases}$ (6)\nLeakyReLU is chosen for several reasons: it addresses the \"dying ReLU\" problem by allowing a small, non-zero gradient for inactive units; it introduces necessary non-linearity; it mitigates the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation; and it promotes sparse activation for efficient feature representation. These properties facilitate more effective training of our deep network and enable the model to learn complex patterns in the data. For the final layer, we implement a Sigmoid activation function, defined as:\n$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ (7)"}, {"title": "4.2 Experiment", "content": "Firstly, the input features were normalized using a standard scaler technique. This preprocessing step is crucial for ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model and for improving the convergence of many machine learning algorithms. The standard scaler normalizes the features by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation, effectively transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The equation for this normalization process is as follows:\n$X_{nor} = \\frac{\u03a7-\u03bc}{\u03c3}$ (8)\nTable 2 presents the model details used for training. The Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimization algorithm was employed for gradient backpropagation to update the neural network weights. Adam combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent \u2013 AdaGrad and RMSProp \u2013 by using adaptive learning rates and momentum. It efficiently handles noisy gradients and is well-suited for problems with large datasets or parameters. During the training of g, the mean squared error (MSE) was used as the loss function to compare predicted values with actual values. The MSE is calculated as follows:\n$L = \\frac{1}{n}\u03a3(\\hat{Yi} \u2013 Y_i)^2$ (9)\nThis choice is motivated by several factors: it normalizes the output to a range suitable for predicting probabilities or normalized engineering property values; it enhances interpretability and prevents unrealistic predictions; its smooth gradient facilitates stable training and convergence; and its non-linear nature allows the model to capture complex relationships in the final layer. This combination of LeakyReLU in hidden layers and Sigmoid in the output layer enables our model to learn intricate non-linear relationships while producing well-bounded, interpretable predictions for our specific task of estimating asphaltic concrete properties. L2 regularization was applied during training of model, also known as Ridge regression or weight decay, is a widely-used technique in machine learning to mitigate overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function.

The dataset was partitioned into 10 equal folds. The validation process underwent 10 iterations, with each iteration designating a unique fold as the test set and the remaining 9 folds as the training set. This approach ensured that each data point was utilized once for testing and 9 times for training. Model training and evaluation occurred"}, {"title": "5. Explainable artificial intelligent model (XAI)", "content": "in each iteration, allowing for assessment of performance across various data subsets. Upon completion of all iterations, results were aggregated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. This method is particularly effective in detecting and mitigating overfitting by testing model consistency across diverse data combinations, thereby yielding a more robust assessment of predictive capabilities. The primary objective was to verify appropriate calibration of model complexity to the limited training data, thus minimizing overfitting risk. The number of folds (k) was set to 10, with 10 iterations to enhance assessment robustness. For instance, in the initial iteration, fold 1 served as the test set, while folds 2-10 were utilized for training. This systematic rotation ensured that each fold functioned as the test set exactly once across all iterations, facilitating a thorough evaluation of model performance across varied data subsets. The model's efficacy was quantified using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), calculated as follows:\n$MAPE = \\frac{1}{n} \u03a3\\begin{equation}    \\left| \\frac{Yi-\\hat{Yi}}{Vi} \\right| \u00d7 100   \\end{equation}$ (11)\nThe proposed model demonstrated superior performance among multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures when compared to alternative configurations (Table 3). Increasing the number of perceptron layers resulted in lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values, potentially due to overfitting. This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's increased capacity to capture complex patterns in the training data, sometimes at the expense of generalizability. Conversely, reducing the number of MLP layers led to increased MAPE values, likely due to underfitting and insufficient model complexity to capture the underlying data patterns. In comparison with other machine learning models, such as CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest, the proposed model demonstrated superior performance. This superiority may be attributed to the MLP's ability to learn non-linear relationships and interactions between features without explicit feature engineering. Among the alternative models, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, possibly due to its ensemble nature and ability to mitigate overfitting through bagging and feature", "subsections": [{"title": "5.1 Global explanation", "content": "randomness. The performance differences observed across these models can be explained by their varying approaches to handling non-linearity, feature interactions, and the bias-variance tradeoff. The proposed MLP model's success suggests that the problem domain may benefit from deep learning approaches that can automatically extract hierarchical features from the input data.\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, introduced by Lundberg and Lee (2017), provide a mathematically rigorous approach to interpreting machine learning model outputs. Grounded in coalitional game theory, SHAP values distribute the model's prediction f(x) among input features according to the equation\nf(x) = \u03c6\u03bf + \u03a3\u2081 \u03c6\u03af(\u03a7) (2)\nwhere o represents the base value and \u2081(x) denotes the SHAP value for feature i.

SHAP values exhibit properties including local accuracy, missingness, and consistency, enhancing their robustness for model interpretation.\nThe SHAP value computation process involves several steps (Fig. 8). As illustrated in the diagram, the process begins with input features (A) fed into a machine learning model (B) to generate an output (C). Concurrently, a base value (D) is established, representing the average model output across the training dataset. SHAP values (E) are then calculated using the input features (A), model output (C), and base value (D), quantifying each feature's impact on the prediction relative to the base value. The final prediction is obtained by summing all SHAP values and adding this to the base value (D), ensuring a complete explanation of the model's output. This approach provides insights into feature importance, direction of impact, interaction effects, and offers both local and global interpretability, thereby enhancing our understanding of model behavior and facilitating trust in Al systems.\nThe study utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to assess the relative importance of factors influencing Marshall Resilient Modulus (MR) and Dynamic Stability (DS) in asphalt concrete mixtures. Results revealed a size-dependent performance of aggregates, with coarse aggregates (particularly those passing through 12.5 mm and 4.75 mm sieves) significantly impacting rutting resistance (DS), while medium-fine aggregates (passing through 2.36 mm to 0.3 mm sieves) primarily influenced stiffness (MR) (Fig. 9). The 0.6 mm sieve size emerged as a critical threshold affecting both properties. Rock type demonstrated a substantial effect on DS but minimal impact on MR, suggesting its importance in rutting resistance. Fine aggregate (FA) content showed a stronger influence on MR, while coarse aggregate (CA) proportion more significantly affected DS. These findings have important implications for optimizing asphalt concrete mix designs, potentially allowing engineers to tailor mixtures for specific performance criteria by adjusting aggregate proportions and selecting appropriate rock types. The study underscores the importance of balancing fine and coarse aggregates to achieve desired stiffness and rutting resistance, while also highlighting areas for future research, such as investigating the mechanisms behind size-dependent performance and exploring optimal gradations for various conditions."}, {"title": "5.2 Local explanation", "content": "MR, exerting a dominant influence on this parameter. This relationship may be attributed to the improved packing of aggregates within the mixture. A higher FAc Ratio indicates a greater proportion of coarser particles within the fine aggregate, which can lead to better interlocking and stability in the aggregate skeleton. This improved structure likely enhances the mixture's resistance to moisture-induced damage, as reflected in the higher MR values. Conversely, while the FAc Ratio also positively affected DS, its impact was comparatively less pronounced. This differential effect highlights the complex nature of asphalt mixture behavior under different loading conditions and performance criteria. The less significant impact on DS suggests that while the coarser portion of fine aggregates contributes to moisture resistance, other factors may play a more dominant role in determining the mixture's resistance to permanent deformation. The lithology of the aggregate used in the mixture emerged as a critical factor for DS, with the use of basalt significantly decreasing DS values. This observation underscores the importance of aggregate mineralogy and surface characteristics in determining the rutting resistance of asphaltic concrete. The lower DS values associated with basalt may be attributed to its surface texture, shape, or physico-chemical interactions with the bitumen binder.\nA noteworthy observation derived from the SHAP analysis pertains to the Coarse Aggregate Ratio (CA Ratio). Specifically, a decrease in the proportion of particles retained on the 4.75 mm (No. 4) and 12.5 mm (1/2 inch) sieves, which corresponds to a lower CA Ratio, resulted in an increase in DS values. This relationship suggests that a lower proportion of these larger particles within the coarse aggregate fraction contributes to improved resistance to permanent deformation. The mechanism behind this effect could be related to a more uniform distribution of aggregate sizes, potentially leading to better particle packing and increased stability in the mixture. This improved stability likely results in better resistance to rutting under repeated loading conditions. Interestingly, the changes in the proportion of particles retained on the 4.75 mm and 12.5 mm sieves did not exhibit a statistically significant effect on MR values, indicating that the mechanisms governing rutting resistance and moisture susceptibility may differ in their sensitivity to the distribution of these particular particle sizes. This differential impact underscores the complexity of aggregate gradation and its varied effects on different performance parameters in asphalt mixtures.\nThis differential impact of the CA and FA Ratios on DS and MR underscores the complexity of asphalt mixture behavior and highlights the importance of carefully balancing aggregate gradation to optimize multiple performance criteria in mix design.

In a specific instance, the model predicted an MR value of 1120.381 MPa, which was below the mean value of 1196.251 MPa as shown in Fig. 12. This reduction was primarily attributed to a higher proportion of particles passing through the 0.6 mm sieve. Conversely, positive contributions to MR were associated with particles passing the 9.5 mm and 2.36 mm sieves. The coarse aggregate ratio exhibited a positive influence relative to the baseline value. To increase the MR value, the analysis suggested two potential strategies: (1) reducing the proportion of particles passing the 0.6 mm sieve, or (2) increasing the proportion of particles passing the 9.5 mm sieve. A simulation demonstrated that reducing the percentage of particles passing the 0.6 mm sieve from 14.3% to 7% resulted in a substantial increase in the predicted MR value from 1120.8 MPa to 1771.2 MPa (Fig. 13).

The emergence of the 0.6 mm sieve size as a critical threshold for both MR and DS is particularly noteworthy. This finding suggests that the proportion of particles in this size range plays a pivotal role in determining the overall performance of the mixture. Future research could delve deeper into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, potentially leading to more targeted gradation designs. The observed size-dependent performance of aggregates, with coarse aggregates primarily influencing rutting resistance and medium-fine aggregates affecting stiffness, aligns with existing theories in pavement engineering. However, our model provides a more nuanced understanding of these relationships, quantifying the relative importance of different size fractions. This knowledge could be invaluable in optimizing gradations for specific performance criteria. The substantial effect of aggregate lithology on dynamic stability highlights the importance of considering not just particle size distribution, but also the inherent properties of the aggregate material. This finding emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to mixture design, considering both gradation and material properties. The differential impacts of Coarse Aggregate (CA) and Fine Aggregate (FA) ratios on DS and MR underscore the complexity of asphalt mixture behavior. These results suggest that optimizing for one performance parameter may involve trade-offs with another, reinforcing the need for balanced design approaches.\nThe development of web-based interfaces for MR and DS prediction represents a significant step towards bridging the gap between research and practice.

The model's predictions are based on a specific dataset and may not generalize to all types of asphalt mixtures or environmental conditions. Future work should focus on expanding the dataset to include a wider range of materials and conditions, potentially leading to more robust and universally applicable models.

The model's accuracy, validated through rigorous k-fold cross-validation, underscores its potential as a powerful tool for asphalt mixture design optimization.\nKey findings from our SHAP value analysis reveal the critical importance of the 0.6 mm sieve size as a threshold affecting both MR and DS, size-dependent performance of aggregates, with coarse aggregates significantly impacting rutting resistance (DS) and medium-fine aggregates primarily influencing stiffness (MR), the substantial effect of aggregate lithology on DS, highlighting the importance of rock type selection in mix design, and the differential impacts of Coarse Aggregate (CA) and Fine Aggregate (FA) ratios on DS and MR, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in gradation design. These insights provide a nuanced understanding of how various gradation parameters influence asphalt concrete performance, offering potential pathways for mix design optimization.\nThe development of web-based interfaces for MR and DS prediction, incorporating explainable features, further bridges the gap between research and practical application. This research contributes to the field by demonstrating the value of explainable Al in unraveling the complexities of asphalt mixture behavior. By providing both predictive power and interpretable insights, our approach offers a promising framework for creating more durable, efficient, and tailored asphalt mixtures."}]}

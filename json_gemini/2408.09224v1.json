INTRODUCTION", "content": "THE rise of AI is rapidly reshaping the world, particularly in the realm of military and national security [1], [2]. AI is already being used across a variety of military applications, ranging from intelligence gathering and surveillance to autonomous weapons systems, fundamentally altering military operations [3]. In the past, human cognitive and decision-making processes were crucial in military strategies. However, the integration of AI has introduced unprecedented levels of sophistication and efficiency. One significant example of this transformation is the use of autonomous drones [4]. These drones can perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and even precision strikes with minimal human involvement [4]. AI has also revolutionized cybersecurity. Neural networks and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time [5]. This is critical for the defense community, as cyberattacks have become increasingly prevalent in the digital age [5]. Beyond traditional battlefields and cyberspace, AI is also playing a pivotal role in enhancing logistical and strategic planning [6]. AI can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of military logistics and supply chain management systems, ensuring that supplies are delivered to the right place at the right time [7]. AI can also be used to develop realistic training and simulation environments for soldiers, helping\nthem to develop the skills and knowledge they need to operate effectively in combat [8], [9]. Another significant impact of AI in military settings is the development of advanced intelligence gathering and surveillance capabilities [3], [10], [11]. Al-powered systems can process vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, including satellites, drones, and social media, allowing militaries to track enemy movements, identify potential threats, and assess battlefield conditions in real-time [3], [11]. AI is also a driving force in the development of cyberwarfare capabilities [12], which involve using computer networks to target an enemy's computer systems and infrastructure [12], [13]. AI can be used to develop cyberweapons that are more sophisticated and effective than traditional cyberweapons [14]. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers developed two main approaches to AI: symbolic Al and connectionist AI [15].\nSymbolic AI. Symbolic AI is a traditional approach to AI that focuses on representing and rule-based reasoning about knowledge using symbols such as words or abstract symbols, rules, and formal logic [15]\u2013[18]. Symbolic AI systems rely on explicit, human-defined knowledge bases that contain facts, rules, and heuristics. These systems use formal logic to make deductions and inferences making it suitable for tasks involving explicit knowledge and logical reasoning. Such systems also use rule-based reasoning to manipulate symbols and draw conclusions. Symbolic AI systems are often transparent and interpretable, meaning it is relatively easy to understand why a particular decision or inference was made. In symbolic AI, knowledge is typically represented using symbols, such as words or abstract symbols, and relationships between symbols are encoded using rules or logical statements [15].\nConnectionist AI. On the other hand, connectionist AI systems leverage artificial neural networks and distributed representation to learn complex patterns from data and excel in tasks involving pattern recognition and complex data processing [16], [19]\u2013[21]. These systems, generally neural networks, are considered a black box due to their lack of interpretability. This is because it is challenging to interpret how they arrive at a particular decision. This lack of transparency is a trade-off for their ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data. The basic building block of a connectionist model is the artificial neuron, and these neurons are organized into layers. The most common type of connectionist model is the feedforward neural network which can be represented as shown in Equation 1 where NL is the number of neurons in layer L and f is the activation function. Here, xi is the input to the network, wij represents the weight connecting neuron i in layer L to neuron j in layer L + 1, bj denotes the bias term for neuron j in layer L + 1, and aj represents the activation of neuron j in layer L +1.\nNL\naj = f Wijxi + bj\ni=1\n(1)\nThis paper explores the potential applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military contexts, highlighting its critical role in enhancing defense systems, strategic decision-making, and the overall landscape of military operations. Beyond the potential, it comprehensively investigates the dimensions and capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, focusing on its ability to improve tactical decision-making, automate intelligence analysis, and strengthen autonomous systems in a military setting. The paper addresses ethical, strategic, and technical considerations related to the development and deployment of Neuro-Symbolic AI in the military. It identifies key challenges and proposes promising directions for future development, emphasizing responsible deployment in areas such as logistics optimization, situational awareness enhancement, and dynamic decision-making.\nContributions. This paper makes the following key contributions to the field of Neuro-Symbolic AI.\n\u2022\nOrganization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the theoretical foundations of Neuro-Symbolic AI, its practical use cases, and examples of how Neuro-Symbolic AI can be applied across various domains. In Section III and its subsections, we discuss the role of Neuro-Symbolic AI in enhancing the autonomy of military weapons systems. Section IV provides a broader perspective on the use of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military applications and examples of the implementation of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military operations. In Section V and its subsections, we discuss the identified challenges, risks, and long-term implications associated with the widespread adoption of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military contexts. Section VI explains the importance of interpretability and explainability of AI in military applications. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and outlines our future directions of research."}, {"title": "II. NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI", "content": "Neuro-Symbolic Al's development is influenced by the historical evolution of AI paradigms, tracing its roots back to the early days of AI research [16]. As previously explained, Neuro-Symbolic AI combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning techniques, incorporating both connectionist and symbolic approaches [30]. This fusion allows the system to understand and manipulate symbols while also learning from data. Such systems can be generally represented as shown in Equation 2 where yi denotes the output of the ith neuron, f the activation function applied to the weighted sum of inputs (as in the purely connectionist model, see Equation 1), g is a function that combines the neural network output with a symbolic rule, and zi represents the external symbolic information or rule associated with the ith neuron. The weights wij determine the influence of input xj on node i, and bi represents the bias term. In this context, the neural network component (f) is responsible for learning from data, while the symbolic component (zi) introduces prior knowledge input or rules. The g function combines both aspects to produce the final output. It is worth noting that the specific form of g can vary widely based on the nature of the symbolic rules and how they are integrated into the underlying neural network. Therefore, it is also worth noting that Equation 2 focuses on a typically single neural network component.\nn\nYi = gf WijXj+bi, Zi\nj=1\n(2)\nNeural networks excel at learning complex patterns from data, but they often lack explicit knowledge representation and logical reasoning capabilities [21], [39]. Symbolic reasoning techniques, on the other hand, are well-suited for tasks involving structured knowledge and logic-based reasoning, but they can struggle with data-driven learning and generalization [17]. While symbolic reasoning handles structured knowledge and logic-based reasoning, it may face challenges when dealing with large and complex problems. In contrast, neural networks efficiently learn from extensive datasets and recognize complex patterns [39], [40].\nNeuro-Symbolic AI models typically aim to bridge this gap by integrating neural networks and symbolic reasoning, creating more robust, adaptable, and flexible AI systems.\nA. Learning Cycle of Neuro-Symbolic AI\nAs shown in, the learning cycle of a Neuro-Symbolic AI system involves the integration of neural and symbolic components in a coherent and iterative process.\nRepresentation Learning. In a representation learning setting, neural networks are employed to acquire meaningful representations from raw data. This process often entails training deep neural networks on extensive datasets using advanced ML techniques [39], [45]. Representation learning enables networks to automatically extract relevant features and patterns from raw data, effectively transforming it into a more informative representation. This learned representation captures the essential characteristics and features of the data, allowing the network the ability to generalize well to previously unseen examples. Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in representation learning, particularly in capturing hierarchical and abstract features from diverse datasets [21], [39]. This success has translated into significant contributions across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, NLP, and recommender systems.\nSymbolic System. The process of transforming learned neural representations into symbolic representations involves the conversion of neural embeddings into interpretable and logically reasoned symbolic entities [46]. This transformation is a crucial step in bridging the gap between neural network-based learning and traditional symbolic reasoning [47]. This approach aims to map neural embeddings, which are distributed numerical representations learned by neural networks, to symbolic entities such as predicates, logical symbols, or rules. This makes the symbolic representations easier for humans to understand and can be used for tasks that involve logical reasoning [48].\nSymbolic Reasoning. Symbolic reasoning techniques in AI involve the use of symbolic representations, such as logic and rules, to model and manipulate knowledge [49]. These techniques aim to enable machines to perform logical reasoning and decision-making in a manner that is understandable and explainable to humans [17]. In symbolic reasoning, information is represented using symbols and their relationships. This encoding approach facilitates the formal expression of knowledge and rules, making it easier to interpret and explain system behavior [49]. The symbolic nature of knowledge representation allows human-understandable explanations of reasoning processes. Furthermore, symbolic representations enhance the model transparency, facilitating an understanding of the reasoning behind model decisions. Symbolic knowledge can also be easily shared and integrated with other systems, promoting knowledge transfer and collaboration.\nExpert Knowledge. Incorporating expert knowledge into the underlying AI models can significantly enhance their ability to reason about complex problems and align their outputs with human understanding and expertise [50]. This involves domain-specific knowledge, rules, and insights provided by human experts in a particular field. In the symbolic component of a Neuro-Symbolic AI system, expert knowledge is often encoded in the form of symbolic rules and logical expressions that capture the structured information and reasoning processes relevant to the application domain [50]. Recent advancements have introduced several innovative techniques for incorporating expert knowledge into AI models. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval mechanisms to enhance the generation capabilities of models by integrating external knowledge sources [51]. G-Retriever employs a novel approach for integrating retrieval-based methods into language models, enhancing their ability to access and utilize domain-specific knowledge [52]. Additionally, process Knowledge-infused Learning incorporates structured process knowledge into learning algorithms to improve decision-making and reasoning in complex tasks [53]. The effective integration of expert knowledge holds significant promise for addressing complex challenges across various domains, such as healthcare, finance, robotics, and NLP [47].\nRefined Knowledge. In Neuro-Symbolic AI, the combination of expert knowledge and the ability to refine that knowledge through iterative learning processes is essential in creating adaptable and effective systems. Expert knowledge serves as a robust initial foundation, while the iterative refinement process allows the model to adapt to new information and continuously enhance its performance [50], [57]. The iterative process is crucial for enabling the model to adjust to changing conditions, improve accuracy, and address inconsistencies that may arise during the integration of neural and symbolic representations [57]. It involves continuously updating representations and rules based on feedback from the neural component or real-world data during the training cycle of Neuro-Symbolic AI. The continuous learning loop enables the AI to adapt seamlessly to changing environments and incorporate new information. Furthermore, the combined symbolic and neural representation provides insights into the reasoning process and decision-making of the AI, making it more transparent and interpretable for humans [58]."}, {"title": "III. AUTONOMY IN MILITARY WEAPONS SYSTEMS", "content": "Autonomy in military weapons systems refers to the ability of a weapon system, such as vehicles and drones, to operate and make decisions with some degree of independence from human intervention [79]. This involves the use of advanced technologies, often including AI, robotics, and ML, to enable military weapons to perceive, analyze, plan, and execute actions in a dynamic and complex environment. One of the most significant ways in which AI is changing the world in military settings is by enabling the development of autonomous weapons systems [10]. Autonomous weapons systems are weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention [80]. While these systems are not yet widely deployed in real-world combat situations, these technologies have the potential to revolutionize warfare and defense. Autonomous weapons systems can be classified into the following two general categories.\nA. Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS)\nLAWS are a class of autonomous weapons systems capable of independently identifying, targeting, and engaging adversaries without direct human control or intervention [80], [81]. These systems rely on a combination of sensor data, AI algorithms, and pre-programmed rules to make decisions [82]. Examples of LAWS include autonomous drones [83], [84], cruise missiles [85], sentry guns [86], and automated turrets. In the context of LAWS, Neuro-Symbolic AI involves incorporating neural network components for perception and learning, coupled with symbolic reasoning to handle higher-level cognition and decision-making.\nHowever, the development of LAWS has been a subject of significant ethical, legal, and policy debates due to concerns about the potential for these systems to operate beyond human control [87], leading to unintended consequences and violations of international law or the escalation of conflicts outside of direct human control [80], [88]\u2013[90]. This poses a serious threat to international stability and the ability of international bodies to manage conflicts [91]. Furthermore, the work in [81] presents the potential human rights implications associated with the use of weapon systems, emphasizing their central role in advocating for a ban on such systems. The author further argues that a requirement inferred from international humanitarian law and human rights law governs armed conflict and implicitly mandates human judgment in lethal decision-making [81]. The deployment of autonomous weapon systems also poses several critical questions regarding the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity. Additionally, it poses challenges in establishing responsibility and accountability for the use of lethal force, as stipulated in international treaties, implicitly requiring human judgment in lethal decision-making [81].\nIntegrating Neuro-Symbolic AI with LAWS holds the potential for significant advantages in addressing decision-making complexity and adaptability. However, this integration also amplifies the concerns mentioned above and introduces additional challenges. For a detailed discussion of the ethical, legal, and technical challenges associated with the integration of AI and autonomous weapons systems, we refer our readers to Sections V and VI. It is important to recognize that while this integration offers enhanced decision-making capabilities, it raises ethical and legal questions, and poses technical challenges.\nSection V provides an in-depth exploration of these concerns, addressing issues such as the ethical implications of autonomous decision-making in weapons systems and the legal framework governing their use. Furthermore, Section VI emphasizes the importance of interpretability and explainability in Neuro-Symbolic AI integrated with LAWS. Transparency in decision-making processes is essential to address public concerns and ensure accountability. However, Neuro-symbolic AI systems can be complex making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. As discussed in Section VI, this lack of transparency hinders verification, validation, and accountability, especially for critical decisions in LAWS. The integration of Neuro-Symbolic AI with LAWS presents both opportunities and challenges. A comprehensive understanding of the associated risks and the need for interpretability is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of these systems.\nB. Non-Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (NLAWS)\nNLAWS are an evolving class of autonomous weapons systems designed for military and security purposes [92]. The primary goal of these systems is incapacitating or deterring adversaries without causing significant lethality. These systems employ non-lethal means, such as disabling electronics, inducing temporary incapacitation, or utilizing other methods to achieve their objectives. Examples of NLAWS include non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, tear gas, electromagnetic jammers, etc. Integrating NLAWS with Neuro-Symbolic AI presents several challenges, particularly in ensuring the interpretability of decisions for human understanding, accountability, and ethical considerations [93], [94]. Even though the primary purpose of these systems is non-lethal, their deployment in conflict situations raises significant ethical concerns. NLAWS must be able to respond effectively to dynamic and unpredictable scenarios, demanding seamless integration with Neuro-Symbolic AI to facilitate learning and reasoning in complex environments. One emerging approach in this context is reservoir computing, which leverages recurrent neural networks with fixed internal dynamics to process temporal information efficiently. This method enhances the system's ability to handle dynamic inputs and supports the learning and reasoning capabilities required for complex environments [95]. Robust fail-safes and validation mechanisms are crucial for ensuring safety and reliability, especially when NLAWS operates autonomously."}, {"title": "IV. MILITARY APPLICATIONS OF NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI", "content": "Militaries worldwide are investing heavily in AI research and development to gain an advantage in future wars. AI has the potential to enhance intelligence collection and accurate analysis, improve cyberwarfare capabilities, and deploy autonomous weapons systems. These applications offer the potential for increased efficiency, reduced risk, and improved operational effectiveness. However, as discussed in Section V, they also raise ethical, legal, and security concerns that must be addressed [88].\nA. Use Cases\nAutonomous Systems. Advanced AI techniques can be used to develop modern autonomous weapons systems that can operate without human intervention. These AI-powered unmanned vehicles, drones, and robotic systems can execute a wide range of complex tasks, such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and logistics, without human intervention [90].\nTarget Recognition. One of the key advantages of AI-powered target and object identification systems is that they can automate a task that is traditionally performed by human operators. Al is revolutionizing target and object identification in the military, enabling automated systems to perform this task with unprecedented accuracy and speed [96].\nPredictive Maintenance. Predictive maintenance is an application of AI that leverages data analysis and ML techniques to predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail or require maintenance [97]. AI enables predictive maintenance by analyzing data to predict equipment maintenance needs [98]. By proactively identifying potential issues in advance, organizations can reduce downtime, minimize unexpected maintenance costs, and optimize their maintenance schedules [99].\nCybersecurity. AI enhances cybersecurity by analyzing patterns, detecting anomalies, and responding rapidly to cyberattacks, thus protecting military networks and information systems [100]. Moreover, advanced AI techniques help in identifying vulnerabilities in these networks and systems, and to develop and implement security patches and mitigations. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, military experts in cybersecurity can contribute to the creation of expert systems that incorporate rules and insights for detecting and responding to cyber threats [100]. Experts in military intelligence can provide knowledge about patterns indicative of potential threats. Al systems can then use this knowledge to analyze large datasets, identify unusual patterns, and provide early warnings.\nLogistics and Resource Management. Military logistics experts can provide knowledge about efficient resource allocation and supply chain management. By leveraging AI-driven systems and advanced strategies, military organizations can use this expertise to optimize logistics, ensuring that resources are deployed effectively during operations [7], [101]. Hence, the military can achieve a higher degree of precision in logistics and supply chain management through the integration of AI technologies.\nTactical Decision Support. Through the seamless integration of AI, particularly Neuro-Symbolic AI, military commanders gain immediate access to real-time data analysis and strategic understanding, enabling more informed and adaptable decision-making on complex battlefields [102]. Expert knowledge can be encoded into AI systems to assist military commanders in strategic planning [103]. This not only improves mission success and reduces collateral damage but also protects soldiers by enhancing potential threat and opportunity identification. By empowering commanders to track troop movements in real-time, analyze communication patterns, and anticipate enemy actions, AI contributes to a better understanding of the situation, ultimately leading to superior tactical choices.\nCommunication and Coordination. Expert knowledge in military command and control can be used to design advanced AI systems that facilitate effective communication and coordination among different units, enhancing overall operational efficiency. AI techniques play a crucial role in improving communication and coordination among military units [104]. By providing real-time data, enhancing situational awareness, and streamlining decision-making processes [104], [105], these techniques facilitate smoother information flow and faster decision-making during critical moments [105].\nTraining and Simulations. Military experts can contribute to the development of realistic training simulations by providing domain-specific knowledge. AI-driven simulations and virtual training environments provide a realistic training experience for military personnel, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in diverse operational scenarios [8], [9]. This helps in preparing military personnel for various scenarios, improving their decision-making skills, strategic thinking, and ability to handle dynamic and complex situations [106]. Beyond training, AI can simulate various scenarios, empowering military planners to test strategies and evaluate potential outcomes before actual deployment [107].\nB. Potential Case Studies\nAssured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR). The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is funding the ANSR research program aimed at developing hybrid AI algorithms that integrate symbolic reasoning with data-driven learning to create robust, assured, and trustworthy systems [31]. Although the ANSR program is still in its early stages, we believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the application of AI use in military operations. ANSR-powered Al systems could be employed to create autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments. For example, ANSR-powered AI systems could be used to develop autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments. Additionally, ANSR-powered AI systems could be instrumental in developing new tools for intelligence analysis, cyber defense, and mission planning [31].\nNeuro-Symbolic AI for Operational Decision Support. The work in [34] describes the use of Neuro-Symbolic AI in developing a system to support operational decision-making in the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Neuro-Symbolic modeling system, as presented in [34], employs a combination of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to generate and evaluate different courses of action within a simulated battlespace to help commanders make better decisions.\nDeep Green (DG) Concept. The DARPA's DG technology helps commanders discover and evaluate more action alternatives and proactively manage operations [35], [36]. This concept differs from traditional planning methods in that it creates a new Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop paradigm. Instead of relying on a priori staff estimates, DG maintains a state space graph of possible future states and uses information on the trajectory of the ongoing operation to assess the likelihood of reaching some set of possible future states [36]. DG is based on the idea that commanders need to be able to think ahead and anticipate the possible consequences of their decisions before they are made. This is difficult to do in the complex and fast-paced environment of the modern battlefield. DG aims to help military commanders by providing them with tools that can help them facilitate faster decision-making in real-time [36]. It also helps the commander to identify and assess the risks and benefits of each operation.\nReal-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making (RAID). The RAID program is another example of Neuro-Symbolic AI used in military applications, as discussed in [38]. RAID, a DARPA research program, focuses on developing AI technology to assist tactical commanders in predicting enemy tactical movements and countering their actions [38]. These include understanding enemy intentions, detecting deception, and providing real-time decision support. RAID achieves this by combining AI for planning with cognitive modeling, game theory, control theory, and ML [38]. These capabilities have significant value in military planning, executing operations, and intelligence analysis."}, {"title": "V.

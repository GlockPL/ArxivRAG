INTRODUCTION", "content": "The rise of AI is rapidly reshaping the world, particularly in the realm of military and national security [1], [2]. AI is already being used across a variety of military applications, ranging from intelligence gathering and surveillance to autonomous weapons systems, fundamentally altering military operations [3]. In the past, human cognitive and decision-making processes were crucial in military strategies. However, the integration of AI has introduced unprecedented levels of sophistication and efficiency. One significant example of this transformation is the use of autonomous drones [4]. These drones can perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and even precision strikes with minimal human involvement [4]. AI has also revolutionized cybersecurity. Neural networks and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed to detect and respond to cyber threats in real-time [5]. This is critical for the defense community, as cyberattacks have become increasingly prevalent in the digital age [5]. Beyond traditional battlefields and cyberspace, AI is also playing a pivotal role in enhancing logistical and strategic planning [6]. AI can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of military logistics and supply chain management systems, ensuring that supplies are delivered to the right place at the right time [7]. AI can also be used to develop realistic training and simulation environments for soldiers, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to operate effectively in combat [8], [9]. Another significant impact of AI in military settings is the development of advanced intelligence gathering and surveillance capabilities [3], [10], [11]. Al-powered systems can process vast amounts of data from a variety of sources, including satellites, drones, and social media, allowing militaries to track enemy movements, identify potential threats, and assess battlefield conditions in real-time [3], [11]. AI is also a driving force in the development of cyberwarfare capabilities [12], which involve using computer networks to target an enemy's computer systems and infrastructure [12], [13]. AI can be used to develop cyberweapons that are more sophisticated and effective than traditional cyberweapons [14]. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers developed two main approaches to AI: symbolic Al and connectionist AI [15].\n\nSymbolic AI. Symbolic AI is a traditional approach to AI that focuses on representing and rule-based reasoning about knowledge using symbols such as words or abstract symbols, rules, and formal logic [15]\u2013[18]. Symbolic AI systems rely on explicit, human-defined knowledge bases that contain facts, rules, and heuristics. These systems use formal logic to make deductions and inferences making it suitable for tasks involving explicit knowledge and logical reasoning. Such systems also use rule-based reasoning to manipulate symbols and draw conclusions. Symbolic AI systems are often transparent and interpretable, meaning it is relatively easy to understand why a particular decision or inference was made. In symbolic AI, knowledge is typically represented using symbols, such as words or abstract symbols, and relationships between symbols are encoded using rules or logical statements [15]. As shown in Figure 1, Symbolic AI is depicted as a knowledge-based system that relies on a knowledge base containing rules and facts. It uses logical inference to perform reasoning and decision-making tasks.\n\nConnectionist AI. On the other hand, connectionist AI systems leverage artificial neural networks and distributed representation to learn complex patterns from data and excel in tasks involving pattern recognition and complex data processing [16], [19]\u2013[21]. These systems, generally neural networks, are considered a black box due to their lack of interpretability. This is because it is challenging to interpret how they arrive at a particular decision. This lack of transparency is a trade-off for their ability to handle complex, high-dimensional data. The basic building block of a connectionist model is the artificial neuron, and these neurons are organized into layers. The most common type of connectionist model is the feedforward neural network which can be represented as shown in Equation 1 where NL is the number of neurons in layer L and f is the activation function. Here, xi is the input to the network, wij represents the weight connecting neuron i in layer L to neuron j in layer L + 1, bj denotes the bias term for neuron j in layer L + 1, and aj represents the activation of neuron j in layer L +1. As shown in Figure 2, connectionist AI is depicted as a neural network organized in layers of interconnected neurons. These networks learn from data by adjusting the strength of connections or weights between neurons. In a connectionist AI setting, knowledge is distributed across the connections and weights of the neural network (see Figure 2). Information is processed in a parallel and distributed manner, allowing neural networks to capture complex patterns and relationships in data [22], [23]. Connectionist AI learns from large datasets through techniques like backpropagation, where errors are propagated backward through the network to adjust the weights [24]. It excels in tasks like image and speech recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition [25], Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling [21], [24], and Transformers for NLP [26] are examples of connectionist AI.\n\nThis paper explores the potential applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military contexts, highlighting its critical role in enhancing defense systems, strategic decision-making, and the overall landscape of military operations. Beyond the potential, it comprehensively investigates the dimensions and capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, focusing on its ability to improve"}, {"title": "II. NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI", "content": "Neuro-Symbolic Al's development is influenced by the historical evolution of AI paradigms, tracing its roots back to the early days of AI research [16]. As previously explained, Neuro-Symbolic AI combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning techniques, incorporating both connectionist and symbolic approaches [30]. This fusion allows the system to understand and manipulate symbols while also learning from data. Such systems can be generally represented as shown in Equation 2 where yi denotes the output of the ith neuron, f the activation function applied to the weighted sum of inputs (as in the purely connectionist model, see Equation 1), g is a function that combines the neural network output with a symbolic rule, and zi represents the external symbolic information or rule associated with the ith neuron. The weights wij determine the influence of input xj on node i, and bi represents the bias term. In this context, the neural network component (f) is responsible for learning from data, while the symbolic component (zi) introduces prior knowledge input or rules. The g function combines both aspects to produce the final output. It is worth noting that the specific form of g can vary widely based on the nature of the symbolic rules and how they are integrated into the underlying neural network. Therefore, it is also worth noting that Equation 2 focuses on a typically single neural network component.\n\nNeural networks excel at learning complex patterns from data, but they often lack explicit knowledge representation and logical reasoning capabilities [21], [39]. Symbolic reasoning techniques, on the other hand, are well-suited for tasks involving structured knowledge and logic-based reasoning, but they can struggle with data-driven learning and generalization [17]. While symbolic reasoning handles structured knowledge and logic-based reasoning, it may face challenges when dealing with large and complex problems. In contrast, neural networks efficiently learn from extensive datasets and recognize complex patterns [39], [40].\n\nNeuro-Symbolic AI models typically aim to bridge this gap by integrating neural networks and symbolic reasoning, creating more robust, adaptable, and flexible AI systems. In Figure 4, we present one example of a Neuro-Symbolic AI architecture that integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks to enhance decision-making. This hybrid approach allows the AI to leverage both the reasoning capabilities of symbolic knowledge and the learning capabilities of neural networks. A key component of this system is a knowledge"}, {"title": "A. Learning Cycle of Neuro-Symbolic AI", "content": "As shown in Figure 5, the learning cycle of a Neuro-Symbolic AI system involves the integration of neural and symbolic components in a coherent and iterative process.\n\nRepresentation Learning. In a representation learning setting, neural networks are employed to acquire meaningful representations from raw data. This process often entails training deep neural networks on extensive datasets using advanced ML techniques [39], [45]. Representation learning enables networks to automatically extract relevant features and patterns from raw data, effectively transforming it into a more informative representation. This learned representation captures the essential characteristics and features of the data, allowing the network the ability to generalize well to previously unseen examples. Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in representation learning, particularly in capturing hierarchical and abstract features from diverse datasets [21], [39]. This success has translated into significant contributions across a wide range of tasks, including image classification, NLP, and recommender systems. By automatically learning meaningful"}, {"title": "B. Practical Applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI", "content": "Neuro-Symbolic AI combines the interpretability and logical reasoning of symbolic AI with the pattern recognition and learning capabilities of data-driven neural networks, enabling new advancements in various domains [59]. This hybrid approach proves effective in solving complex problems and enhancing decision-making in industrial-strength applications, including speech and pattern recognition, image analysis, investment analysis, engine monitoring, fault diagnosis, bioinformatics, engineering, and robotics [37]. Furthermore, this approach finds practical applications in developing systems that can accurately diagnose diseases, discover drugs, design more efficient NLP networks, and make informed financial decisions. Some of the practical applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI include the following.\n\nNatural Language Understanding. Neuro-Symbolic AI models use a combination of neural networks and symbolic knowledge to enhance the performance of NLP tasks such as answering questions [33], machine translation [60], and text summarization. For example, the Neuro-Symbolic Language Model (NSLM) is a state-of-the-art model that combines a deep learning model with a database of knowledge to answer questions more accurately [61].\n\nCommonsense Reasoning. Neuro-Symbolic AI can enable Al systems to reason about everyday situations, making them better at understanding context [62], [63]. This is because Neuro-Symbolic AI models combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning. One key aspect of commonsense reasoning is counterfactual reasoning, which allows the AI to consider alternative scenarios and their potential outcomes [64]. This helps the AI understand the cause-and-effect relationships in everyday situations. Another important aspect is defeasible reasoning, where the AI can make conclusions based on the available evidence, acknowledging that these conclusions might be overridden by new information [65].\n\nComputer Vision. Neuro-Symbolic AI models are capable of improving the accuracy and interpretability of various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, scene understanding, and visual reasoning by incorporating symbolic knowledge into neural networks [29], [33], [66]\u2013[68]. This enables neuro-symbolic AI models to reason about the world and make predictions that are more consistent with human understanding.\n\nHealthcare. Combining symbolic medical knowledge with neural networks can improve disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and prediction accuracy [69]\u2013[71]. This approach has the potential to ultimately make medical AI systems more interpretable, reliable, and generalizable [72]. For example, the work in [73] proposes a Recursive Neural Knowledge Network (RNKN) that combines medical knowledge based on first-order logic for multi-disease diagnosis.\n\nFinance. Neuro-Symbolic AI systems have the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by developing systems that can make better financial decisions [74]. These systems can help financial institutions in building advanced models for predicting market risks [75].\n\nRobotics. Integrating symbolic reasoning with neural networks can enhance the adaptability and reasoning capabilities of robots [76]. A robot that uses symbolic reasoning can efficiently plan its route through an environment more effectively and adaptively than a robot relying on learning from data [77]. By using its symbolic knowledge of the environment, the robot can determine the best route to reach its destination. Additionally, a robot employing symbolic reasoning better understands and responds to human"}, {"title": "III. AUTONOMY IN MILITARY WEAPONS SYSTEMS", "content": "Autonomy in military weapons systems refers to the ability of a weapon system, such as vehicles and drones, to operate and make decisions with some degree of independence from human intervention [79]. This involves the use of advanced technologies, often including AI, robotics, and ML, to enable military weapons to perceive, analyze, plan, and execute actions in a dynamic and complex environment. One of the most significant ways in which AI is changing the world in military settings is by enabling the development of autonomous weapons systems [10]. Autonomous weapons systems are weapons that can select and engage targets without human intervention [80]. While these systems are not yet widely deployed in real-world combat situations, these technologies have the potential to revolutionize warfare and defense. Autonomous weapons systems can be classified into the following two general categories."}, {"title": "A. Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS)", "content": "LAWS are a class of autonomous weapons systems capable of independently identifying, targeting, and engaging adversaries without direct human control or intervention [80], [81]. These systems rely on a combination of sensor data, AI algorithms, and pre-programmed rules to make decisions [82]. Examples of LAWS include autonomous drones [83], [84], cruise missiles [85], sentry guns [86], and automated turrets. In the context of LAWS, Neuro-Symbolic AI involves incorporating neural network components for perception and learning, coupled with symbolic reasoning to handle higher-level cognition and decision-making.\n\nHowever, the development of LAWS has been a subject of significant ethical, legal, and policy debates due to concerns about the potential for these systems to operate beyond human control [87], leading to unintended consequences and violations of international law or the escalation of conflicts outside of direct human control [80], [88]\u2013[90]. This poses a serious threat to international stability and the ability of international bodies to manage conflicts [91]. Furthermore, the work in [81] presents the potential human rights implications associated with the use of weapon systems, emphasizing their central role in advocating for a ban on such systems. The author further argues that a requirement inferred from international humanitarian law and human rights law governs armed conflict and implicitly mandates human judgment in lethal decision-making [81]. The deployment of autonomous weapon systems also poses several critical questions regarding the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military necessity. Additionally, it poses challenges in establishing responsibility and accountability for the use of lethal force, as stipulated in international treaties, implicitly requiring human judgment in lethal decision-making [81].\n\nIntegrating Neuro-Symbolic AI with LAWS holds the potential for significant advantages in addressing decision-making complexity and adaptability. However, this integration also amplifies the concerns mentioned above and introduces additional challenges. For a detailed discussion of the ethical, legal, and technical challenges associated with the integration of AI and autonomous weapons systems, we refer our readers to Sections V and VI. It is important to recognize that while this integration offers enhanced decision-making capabilities, it raises ethical and legal questions, and poses technical challenges.\n\nSection V provides an in-depth exploration of these concerns, addressing issues such as the ethical implications of autonomous decision-making in weapons systems and the legal framework governing their use. Furthermore, Section VI emphasizes the importance of interpretability and explainability in Neuro-Symbolic AI integrated with LAWS. Transparency in decision-making processes is essential to address public concerns and ensure accountability. However, Neuro-symbolic AI systems can be complex making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. As discussed in Section VI, this lack of transparency hinders verification, validation, and accountability, especially for critical decisions in LAWS. The integration of Neuro-Symbolic AI with LAWS presents both opportunities and challenges. A comprehensive understanding of the associated risks and the need for interpretability is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of these systems."}, {"title": "B. Non-Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (NLAWS)", "content": "NLAWS are an evolving class of autonomous weapons systems designed for military and security purposes [92]. The primary goal of these systems is incapacitating or deterring adversaries without causing significant lethality. These systems employ non-lethal means, such as disabling electronics, inducing temporary incapacitation, or utilizing other methods to achieve their objectives. Examples of NLAWS include non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, tear gas, electromagnetic jammers, etc. Integrating NLAWS with Neuro-Symbolic AI presents several challenges, particularly in ensuring the interpretability of decisions for human understanding, accountability, and ethical considerations [93], [94]. Even though the primary purpose of these systems is non-lethal, their deployment in conflict situations raises significant ethical concerns. NLAWS must be able to respond effectively to dynamic and unpredictable scenarios, demanding seamless integration with Neuro-Symbolic AI to facilitate learning and reasoning in complex environments. One emerging approach in this context is reservoir computing, which leverages recurrent neural networks with fixed internal"}, {"title": "IV. MILITARY APPLICATIONS OF NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI", "content": "Militaries worldwide are investing heavily in AI research and development to gain an advantage in future wars. AI has the potential to enhance intelligence collection and accurate analysis, improve cyberwarfare capabilities, and deploy autonomous weapons systems. Figure 6 shows some of the main military applications of Neuro-Symbolic AI. These applications offer the potential for increased efficiency, reduced risk, and improved operational effectiveness. However, as discussed in Section V, they also raise ethical, legal, and security concerns that must be addressed [88]."}, {"title": "A. Use Cases", "content": "Autonomous Systems. Advanced AI techniques can be used to develop modern autonomous weapons systems that can operate without human intervention. These AI-powered unmanned vehicles, drones, and robotic systems can execute a wide range of complex tasks, such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and logistics, without human intervention [90].\n\nTarget Recognition. One of the key advantages of AI-powered target and object identification systems is that they can automate a task that is traditionally performed by human operators. Al is revolutionizing target and object identification in the military, enabling automated systems to perform this task with unprecedented accuracy and speed [96].\n\nPredictive Maintenance. Predictive maintenance is an application of AI that leverages data analysis and ML techniques to predict when equipment or machinery is likely to fail or require maintenance [97]. AI enables predictive maintenance by analyzing data to predict equipment maintenance needs [98]. By proactively identifying potential issues in advance, organizations can reduce downtime, minimize unexpected maintenance costs, and optimize their maintenance schedules [99].\n\nCybersecurity. AI enhances cybersecurity by analyzing patterns, detecting anomalies, and responding rapidly to cyberattacks, thus protecting military networks and information systems [100]. Moreover, advanced AI techniques help in identifying vulnerabilities in these networks and systems, and to develop and implement security patches and mitigations. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, military experts in cybersecurity can contribute to the creation of expert systems that incorporate rules and insights for detecting and responding to cyber threats [100]. Experts in military intelligence can provide knowledge about patterns indicative of potential threats. Al systems can then use this knowledge to analyze large datasets, identify unusual patterns, and provide early warnings.\n\nLogistics and Resource Management. Military logistics experts can provide knowledge about efficient resource allocation and supply chain management. By leveraging AI-driven systems and advanced strategies, military organizations can use this expertise to optimize logistics, ensuring that resources are deployed effectively during operations [7], [101]. Hence, the military can achieve a higher degree of precision in logistics and supply chain management through the integration of AI technologies.\n\nTactical Decision Support. Through the seamless integration of AI, particularly Neuro-Symbolic AI, military commanders gain immediate access to real-time data analysis and strategic understanding, enabling more informed and adaptable decision-making on complex battlefields [102]. Expert knowledge can be encoded into AI systems to assist military commanders in strategic planning [103]. This not only improves mission success and reduces collateral damage but also protects soldiers by enhancing potential threat and opportunity identification. By empowering commanders to track troop movements in real-time, analyze communication patterns, and anticipate enemy actions, AI contributes to a better understanding of the situation, ultimately leading to superior tactical choices.\n\nCommunication and Coordination. Expert knowledge in military command and control can be used to design advanced AI systems that facilitate effective communication and coordination among different units, enhancing overall operational efficiency. AI techniques play a crucial role in improving communication and coordination among military units [104]. By providing real-time data, enhancing situational awareness, and streamlining decision-making processes [104], [105], these techniques facilitate smoother information flow and faster decision-making during critical moments [105].\n\nTraining and Simulations. Military experts can contribute to the development of realistic training simulations by providing domain-specific knowledge. AI-driven simulations and virtual training environments provide a realistic training experience for military personnel, helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in diverse operational scenarios [8], [9]. This helps in preparing military personnel for various scenarios, improving their decision-making skills, strategic thinking, and ability to handle dynamic and complex situations [106]. Beyond training, AI can simulate various scenarios, empowering military planners to test strategies and evaluate potential outcomes before actual deployment [107]."}, {"title": "B. Potential Case Studies", "content": "Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR). The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is funding the ANSR research program aimed at developing hybrid AI algorithms that integrate symbolic reasoning with data-driven learning to create robust, assured, and trustworthy systems [31]. Although the ANSR program is still in its early stages, we believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the application of AI use in military operations. ANSR-powered Al systems could be employed to create autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments. For example, ANSR-powered AI systems could be used to develop autonomous systems that can make complex decisions in uncertain and dynamic environments. Additionally, ANSR-powered AI systems could be instrumental in developing new tools for intelligence analysis, cyber defense, and mission planning [31].\n\nNeuro-Symbolic AI for Operational Decision Support. The work in [34] describes the use of Neuro-Symbolic AI in developing a system to support operational decision-making in the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Neuro-Symbolic modeling system, as presented in [34], employs a combination of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to generate and evaluate different courses of action within a simulated battlespace to help commanders make better decisions.\n\nDeep Green (DG) Concept. The DARPA's DG technology helps commanders discover and evaluate more action alternatives and proactively manage operations [35], [36]. This concept differs from traditional planning methods in that it creates a new Observe, Orient, Decide, Act (OODA) loop paradigm. Instead of relying on a priori staff estimates, DG maintains a state space graph of possible future states and uses information on the trajectory of the ongoing operation to assess the likelihood of reaching some set of possible future states [36]. DG is based on the idea that commanders need to be able to think ahead and anticipate the possible consequences of their decisions before they are made. This is difficult to do in the complex and fast-paced environment of the modern battlefield. DG aims to help military commanders by providing them with tools that can help them facilitate faster decision-making in real-time [36]. It also helps the commander to identify and assess the risks and benefits of each operation.\n\nReal-time Adversarial Intelligence and Decision-making (RAID). The RAID program is another example of Neuro-Symbolic AI used in military applications, as discussed in [38]. RAID, a DARPA research program, focuses on developing AI technology to assist tactical commanders in predicting enemy tactical movements and countering their actions [38]. These include understanding enemy intentions, detecting deception, and providing real-time decision support. RAID achieves this by combining AI for planning with cognitive modeling, game theory, control theory, and ML [38]. These capabilities have significant value in military planning, executing operations, and intelligence analysis."}, {"title": "V. CHALLENGES AND RISKS", "content": "Autonomous weapons systems are considered a promising new technology with the potential to revolutionize warfare [108]. However, the development of autonomous weapons systems is raising several ethical and legal concerns [79], [87], [88]. For example, there is a concern that LAWS could be used to carry out indiscriminate attacks [79]. Furthermore, there is a growing fear that the development of LAWS could lead to a new arms race, as countries compete to develop the most advanced autonomous weapons systems [109]. Additionally, there are technical challenges to overcome before autonomous weapons systems can be widely deployed [110], such as reliably distinguishing between combatants and civilians operating in complex environments."}, {"title": "A. Ethical and Legal Challenges", "content": "Moral Concerns. The integration of AI into lethal weapons raises several ethical and moral questions [111], such as discrimination, proportionality, and dehumanization, regarding the moral implications of delegating critical decisions to machines [112], [113]. Furthermore, the potential for AI-powered autonomous weapons systems to operate beyond human control poses the risk of unintended consequences, violating ethical norms and principles, such as mission creep [114], hacking and manipulation [115], and escalation of conflict [116]. One potential approach to address this challenge is to develop comprehensive ethical guidelines and standards for the deployment of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military applications. These guidelines should encompass principles of discrimination, proportionality, and accountability [117], [118]. Furthermore, implementing robust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms is crucial to identify and address potential biases or unintended outcomes during AI system deployment [119].\n\nAutonomous Decision-Making. The deployment of Neuro-Symbolic AI in military operations raises significant ethical concerns related to autonomous decision-making [90]. These systems, particularly neural networks, exhibit complex and non-linear behavior that can lead to unforeseen consequences, challenging control, and foreseeability. To mitigate this, ethical considerations must be integrated into the design phase, along with clear guidelines and principles for development and deployment [117]. Establishing clear ethical guidelines and principles for developing and deploying Neuro-Symbolic AI in military applications can guide responsible decision-making [118]. Integrating ethics into the design phase mitigates potential negative consequences [117]."}, {"title": "B. Technical Challenges", "content": "Knowledge Representation and Integration. Creating symbolic representations that accurately capture the complexities of real-world battlefield scenarios and their ethical implications is a challenging task [106], [134]. Several factors contribute to this complexity, including the dynamic and unpredictable nature of warfare, uncertainty and incomplete information, and adaptability to changing environments [124]. To address these challenges requires developing dynamic models that can dynamically adjust to evolving information and scenarios, effectively manage uncertainty and incompleteness in data, and integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines seamlessly. Furthermore, integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines is crucial for the robustness and accuracy of symbolic representations [124].\n\nTarget Discrimination. In dynamic battlefield environments, accurately identifying combatants and non-combatants is a complex challenge [135]. Ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law and minimizing the risk of civilian casualties are important concerns [110]. Autonomous systems face challenges in low-light conditions, where cameras and advanced sensors may struggle, and radar may misinterpret objects, leading to potential misidentification and harm to civilians [135]. Furthermore, the use of ML algorithms trained on biased data introduces the risk of perpetuating discriminatory targeting patterns [127], [136]. For example, an algorithm trained on data identifying combatants with specific ethnicities or clothing styles may erroneously target individuals with similar appearances, regardless of their actual involvement in the conflict. Enhancing target discrimination in diverse conditions can be achieved through advanced sensors and multispectral imaging, coupled with training ML algorithms on unbiased and varied datasets [127], [135], [136].\n\nSecurity and Robustness. As explained above, nations possessing advanced Neuro-Symbolic AI capabilities could gain a strategic advantage. This could lead to concerns about security and potential misuse of AI technologies, prompting diplomatic efforts to address these issues. Hence, the security and robustness of autonomous weapons systems are crucial for addressing ethical, legal, and safety concerns [137]. Ensuring resistance to cyber threats such as hacking, data manipulation, and spoofing is essential to prevent misuse and unintended consequences [90], [138]. A reliable, ethical decision-making process, including accurate target identification, proportionality assessment, and adherence to international law, is essential. To enhance the robustness and resilience of Neuro-Symbolic AI systems against adversarial attacks, training the underlying AI model with both clean and adversarial inputs is effective [139], [140]. Additionally, incorporating formal methods for symbolic verification and validation ensures the correctness of symbolic reasoning components [141]. Employing ensemble methods further enhances robustness and makes it challenging for attackers to craft effective adversarial inputs [142].\n\nReliability. The reliability of autonomous weapons systems is crucial in minimizing the risk of unintended consequences [10], [143]. This involves ensuring the reliability of sensor data, communication systems, and decision-making algorithms. Autonomous weapons systems heavily depend on sensors to perceive their environment. Faulty sensors or misinterpretations can lead to targeting the wrong individuals or objects, leading to civilian casualties, and posing legal and ethical challenges [144]. Sensors and their communication channels are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can manipulate data, causing malfunctions or deliberate targeting of unintended entities. Implementing secure communication protocols and robust cybersecurity measures is essential to safeguard against such manipulations [10]. Furthermore, reliable communication is crucial for transmitting data to and from autonomous weapons systems. The use of redundant communication channels and fail-safe mechanisms is necessary to ensure uninterrupted operation, even in the event of a channel failure [145].\n\nAdaptability. Enhancing the adaptability and robustness of Neuro-Symbolic AI systems in unpredictable and adversarial environments is crucial. Warfare is dynamic, and battlefield conditions can evolve rapidly. Warfare is dynamic, and battlefield conditions can evolve rapidly. Therefore, autonomous weapons systems must possess the adaptability to be employed safely in changing and unpredictable environments and scenarios [110]. These systems need to be capable of adjusting their tactics, strategies, and decision-making processes to respond to unforeseen events, tactics, or countermeasures by adversaries. Achieving this level of adaptability requires advanced AI algorithms, sensor systems, and the ability to learn from new information and adapt accordingly. One approach to achieving adaptability involves employing advanced ML algorithms, such as RL, to enable autonomous systems to learn optimal behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with the environment, enhancing their ability to adapt to new and unforeseen situations based on rewards and penalties in dynamic environments [146]. Transfer learning techniques can also allow Neuro-Symbolic AI systems to leverage knowledge from one context and apply it to related contexts, improving their generalization and adaptability capabilities [147]. Additionally, integrating Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can facilitate collaborative decision-making and adaptive behavior in complex environments by enabling multiple autonomous agents to coordinate and share information effectively [148]. Continuous monitoring and real-time data integration from diverse sensors can further enhance responsiveness and adaptability by providing up-to-date situational awareness and allowing real-time adjustments to tactics and strategies [25], [149]. Ensuring explainability and transparency in AI decision-making processes remains crucial, especially for"}, {"title": "VI. INTERPRETABILITY AND EXPLAINABILITY", "content": "Interpretability and explainability are critical aspects of Neuro-Symbolic AI systems, particularly when applied in military settings [93], [94]. Ensuring interpretability and explainability in advanced Neuro-Symbolic Al systems for military applications is important for a wide range of reasons, including accountability, trust, validation, collaboration, and legal compliance [150].\n\nAccountability and Trust. Transparency and explainability are crucial for algorithms within autonomous weapons systems to build trust and accountability [153]. In the context of military settings, the consequences of AI decisions are profound. XAI enables military personnel and decision-makers to understand the rationale behind specific AI actions, ensuring transparency and building trust in these systems [93], [94]. This understanding is vital to guarantee alignment with military objectives and adherence to ethical standards [93].\n\nValidation and Error Correction. Ensuring the reliability, safety, and ethical compliance of AI systems is important in military and defense applications. Interpretable AI plays a vital role in validating AI models and identifying potential errors or biases in their decision-making processes [93], enhancing accuracy, and reducing the risk of unintended outcomes. However, comprehensive testing and verification remain challenging due to the inherent complexity of military Al systems and their potential for unexpected emergent behaviors [154]. Recent advancements in Neuro-Symbolic AI have highlighted the importance of robust Verification and Validation (V&V) methods, Testing and Evaluations (T&E) processes. Renkhoff et al. [155] provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art techniques in Neuro-Symbolic T&E. Their work emphasizes the critical need for rigorous V&V in these systems, outlining challenges, methodologies, and frameworks to ensure the reliability and safety of Neuro-Symbolic AI applications, particularly relevant for military contexts, in our case, where precision and dependability are important.\n\nHuman-Machine Collaboration. Military decision-making often involves complex tasks that require a combination of human and AI capabilities. Interpretable AI facilitates this collaboration between humans and AI systems by providing understandable insights into the Al's reasoning [156], [157]. Such collaboration enhances the overall decision-making process and mission effectiveness, empowering humans to better understand and leverage the Al's insights.\n\nLegal and Ethical Compliance. Military operations must adhere to international laws and ethical guidelines [158], [159]. Interpretable AI, with its ability to provide transparent insights into Al reasoning, plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance by enabling the military to demonstrate that its decisions align with relevant laws, ethical standards, and the potential consequences of those decisions [160]."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In conclusion, this paper highlights the transformative potential of Neuro-Symbolic AI for military applications. This technology could revolutionize modern warfare by enabling complex decision-making in dynamic battlefield conditions, optimizing resource allocation through predictive analytics, and automating intelligence tasks such as target identification and threat assessment. However, the careful development and deployment of Neuro-Symbolic AI require careful consideration of ethical issues, including data privacy, AI decision explainability, and potential unintended consequences of autonomous systems.\n\nOur future work will focus on addressing these challenges while exploring innovative applications such as adaptive robots and resilient autonomous systems. These efforts will advance the role of Neuro-Symbolic AI in enhancing national security. We will also investigate optimal human-AI collaboration methods, focusing on human-AI teaming dynamics and designing AI systems that augment human capabilities. This approach ensures that Neuro-Symbolic AI serves as a powerful tool to support, rather than replace, human decision-making in military contexts."}]}

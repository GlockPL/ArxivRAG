{"title": "Nasdaq-100 Companies' Hiring Insights: A Topic-based\nClassification Approach to the Labor Market", "authors": ["Seyed Mohammad Ali Jafari", "Ehsan Chitsaz"], "abstract": "The emergence of new and disruptive technologies makes the\neconomy and labor market more unstable. To overcome this kind of uncertainty\nand to make the labor market more comprehensible, we must employ labor\nmarket intelligence techniques, which are predominantly based on data analysis.\nCompanies use job posting sites to advertise their job vacancies, known as\nonline job vacancies (OJVs). LinkedIn is one of the most utilized websites for\nmatching the supply and demand sides of the labor market; companies post\ntheir job vacancies on their job pages, and LinkedIn recommends these jobs to\njob seekers who are likely to be interested. However, with the vast number of\nonline job vacancies, it becomes challenging to discern overarching trends in\nthe labor market. In this paper, we propose a data mining-based approach for\njob classification in the modern online labor market. We employed structural\ntopic modeling as our methodology and used the NASDAQ-100 indexed\ncompanies' online job vacancies on LinkedIn as the input data. We discover that\namong all 13 job categories, Marketing, Branding, and Sales; Software\nEngineering; Hardware Engineering; Industrial Engineering; and Project\nManagement are the most frequently posted job classifications.

Environmental challenges linked to global population growth can be\naddressed through innovative technologies such as fully electric machines (HEV/EV),\nwhich catalyze the emergence of new industries necessitating novel types of\nemployees (L\u00f3pez Ibarra, Matallana, Andreu, & Kortabarria, 2019). Moreover,\ndemographic shifts alter labor market demands and firm strategies, influencing the\ndynamics of employment across sectors (Hopenhayn, Neira, & Singhania, 2022). This\ncomplex and unpredictable labor market environment underscores the need for\nHuman Resource (HR) managers, policymakers, and job seekers to gain a nuanced\nunderstanding of labor market trends. Recent research has shown that the adoption of\nmachine learning and big data analytics can significantly enhance the analysis of\nlabor market dynamics, providing essential insights for policy makers and HR\nprofessionals (Mr\u0161i\u0107, Jerkovic, & Balkovic, 2020).\nLinkedIn is primarily a social network focused on facilitating the hiring process for\nboth job seekers and employers. Many high-tech companies rely on LinkedIn as a tool\nfor talent acquisition and hiring employees. Although LinkedIn is an effective hiring\ntool (Karakatsanis et al., 2017), it lacks certain features that could help human\nresource managers, policymakers, and job seekers understand labor market trends and\npatterns.

Such analyses\nrepresent technological advances and can be of great value to human resource\nmanagers, policymakers, and job seekers to understand categories and the prevalence\nof the modern job market.\nHuman resource managers face challenges in adapting to rapid shifts in\nemployment conditions and maintaining workforce engagement, compounded by the\nintricacies of legal and organizational frameworks that emerged particularly during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. These frameworks include handling changes in\nemployment laws, managing compensation issues, and preserving employee well-\nbeing (Yusefi et al., 2022). Policymakers are tasked with developing responsive\nemployment programs to stabilize and grow the economy post-disruption, while job\nseekers navigate an increasingly complex job market, where agility and upskilling\nbecome necessary to align with new industry demands.\nThis study leverages the power of data mining and structural topic modeling to\noffer a granular analysis of labor market trends within high-tech industries,"}, {"title": "Related Works", "content": ""}, {"title": "Overview of Current Literature", "content": "Due to the rapid growth of online job vacancy advertisements and their increasing\ncredibility among young talented individuals, we could implement AI methodologies\nsuch as Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to explore\nand discover trends in the labor market. This kind of analysis, named Labor Market\nIntelligence (LMI), offers a faster and more expansive capability for analyzing trends\ncompared to traditional surveys (Boselli, Cesarini, Mercorio, & Mezzanzanica, 2018).\nIn recent research in the field of labor market intelligence, researchers have used\nvarious machine learning and natural language processing techniques to classify\nonline job vacancies extracted from different sources, employing standard taxonomies\nsuch as the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO),\nInternational Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), or Occupational\nInformation Network (ONET). Karakatsanis et al.

All job postings were standardized by converting\ntext to lowercase to eliminate discrepancies caused by case sensitivity. Non-\nalphanumeric characters, numbers, and short words of fewer than three characters\nwere removed to simplify the text and focus on meaningful content. This\nnormalization process is critical for maintaining consistency across the dataset and for\nthe effective application of natural language processing techniques (Savin et al.,\n2022).\nStop Words Removal. Common English stop words, along with domain-specific\njargon that offers minimal informational value, were removed using the Natural\nLanguage Toolkit (NLTK). Additionally, we employed a custom list of stop words\ntailored to our specific dataset, which includes terms frequently found in job postings\nbut that do not contribute significantly to the overall analysis.

In our study, we employed t-\ndistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to facilitate this process. t-SNE is\nrenowned for its effectiveness in reducing high-dimensional data to lower-\ndimensional spaces, making it possible to visually assess the coherence and accuracy\nof clustering (Cao & Wang, 2017).\nRationale and Advantages of Using t-SNE. We chose t-SNE over other\ndimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or MDS due to its exceptional ability to\nmaintain local data structures, which is crucial for accurately reflecting the thematic\ncloseness of job postings. This method allows for a visual inspection of how well the\ntopic model groups similar content, which is indispensable for our analysis (van der\nMaaten & Hinton, 2008).\nPerformance Metrics and Enhanced t-SNE Usage Discussion. To quantitatively\nvalidate the topic model, we utilized two intrinsic metrics: coherence and exclusivity.\nCoherence evaluates how semantically related the top words within each topic are,\nproviding an indication of how interpretable these topics are to human analysts.\nExclusivity measures the uniqueness of the top words to their respective topics,\nenhancing the model's ability to distinctly categorize content (Savin et al., 2022).\nThese metrics were complemented by the t-SNE visualization, which plots each\njob posting as a point in a two-dimensional space. The effective clustering of these\npoints according to their topics not only visualizes but also substantiates the model's\naccuracy. We specifically looked for tightly-knit clusters within the visualization as\nthese indicate that the model has successfully grouped postings with similar topical\nthemes. The proximity of postings within the same cluster in this reduced space\nsupports the validity of our model, affirming that postings predicted to be similar are\nindeed closely related (Mustak et al., 2021)."}, {"title": "Result and Discussion", "content": "Table 1 demonstrates 13 topics achieved with help of the Structural Topic Modeling\n(STM) R package, it also shows the prevalence of each topic among all 19961 job\ndescriptions and the most discriminating (frequent and exclusive) words within each\ntopic.

Figure 4\nrepresents word clouds of each topic to help us recognize the subject of each topic."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "The purpose of this study is to gain insights into companies indexed in the Nasdaq-\n100, which is heavily tech-based (Rutledge et al., 2016). These insights are based on\nthe descriptions of job advertisements from Nasdaq-100 companies. We collected\n19,961 Online Job Vacancies (OJVs) from job advertisement descriptions of these\ncompanies between November and December 2022.\nWe selected this timeframe for two reasons: 1) November to December is a crucial\nrecruitment season for companies. They typically complete budgets in October and\nNovember and post new jobs in December. Companies with strategic hiring plans\ntend to seek talent in November and December and expect to make hires in January\nand February (Umphress, 2017). 2) The maximum time span provided by LinkedIn is\none month.\nUsing structural topic modeling, we have identified 13 job categories from all the\nNasdaq-100 companies' job advertisements during the recruitment season.\nThe insights we provide could be valuable for job seekers, human resource\nmanagers, and policymakers. Job seekers can benefit from these insights by better\nunderstanding their career paths and the trends within their companies of interest in\nthe labor market. This knowledge could help them enhance their skills to align with\nlabor market preferences. Human resource managers can benefit from these insights\nby understanding the labor market situation and the strategies of their competitors and\nmarket leaders. It is worth mentioning that the companies we studied are from the\nNasdaq-100, which are highly valuable in terms of market capitalization within their\nindustries; knowledge of their strategies and actions can provide valuable information\nabout the industries in which they operate. Policymakers could use our findings to\nmake the education system more productive and market-oriented. For example, they\ncould invest more in fields such as marketing, business management, and engineering\nrather than other majors to accelerate the alignment between the demand and supply\nsegments of the labor market. Job seekers could also align their knowledge with\nmarket needs to derive greater benefit from it.\nOur study could be enriched in many ways in future studies, 1- Integrating Diverse\nData Sources and AI Technologies: Future research could significantly benefit from\nincorporating a wider array of data sources. While LinkedIn offers a rich dataset,\nplatforms like Stack Exchange and GitHub provide unique insights into the tech\ncommunity's discussions and collaborations, which are invaluable for understanding\nthe supply side of the labor market. Moreover, adopting Explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques could enhance the transparency and reliability of AI applications in LMI,\nmaking the findings more actionable and trustworthy (F. Colace et al., 2019). 2-\nPredictive Modeling and Real-Time Analysis: Building predictive models that can\nanalyze trends over longer periods will provide deeper insights into labor market\ndynamics. Utilizing machine learning frameworks to analyze data collected from\nvarious job portals can help forecast future labor demands, offering a proactive tool\nfor job seekers and policymakers (N. Alsayed & W. Awad, 2023). Such models could\nalso integrate real-time economic indicators to dynamically adjust predictions based\non current market conditions. 3- Collaborative Frameworks for Multi-Sector\nAnalysis: Lastly, establishing collaborative frameworks involving academia, industry,\nand government can enhance the effectiveness of LMI systems. These collaborations\ncan facilitate the sharing of data and insights, leading to more comprehensive labor\nmarket analyses that span multiple sectors and geographies. Such efforts will be\ncrucial in developing adaptive educational programs and workforce development\ninitiatives that are aligned with future job market requirements.\nAs for limitations, our study is dependent on the quality and availability of online\njob vacancies. Topic modeling classifications are very sensitive to input data, and the\nquality and precision of classification improve as the quality and specificity of job\nposts increase. Ideally, online job vacancies should contain detailed job descriptions;\nhowever, many are written in a templated format that includes generic information\nabout companies, workplace atmosphere, and employee expectations, which are not\nvery useful for job classification. To overcome this limitation, researchers should\nwork on developing cleaning algorithms that eliminate less pertinent information in\njob descriptions."}]}

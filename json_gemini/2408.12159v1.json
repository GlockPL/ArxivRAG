Lyu"], "abstract": "The code written by developers usually suffers from efficiency problems and contain various performance bugs. These inefficiencies necessitate the research of automated refactoring methods for code optimization. Early research in code optimization employs rule-based methods and focuses on specific inefficiency issues, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage issue. Recent work regards the task as a sequence generation problem, and resorts to deep learning (DL) techniques such as large language models (LLMs). These methods typically prompt LLMs to directly generate optimized code. Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, such one-step generation paradigm is hard to achieve an optimal solution. First, complex optimization methods such as combinatorial ones are hard to be captured by LLMs. Second, the one-step generation paradigm poses challenge in precisely infusing the knowledge required for effective code optimization within LLMs, resulting in under-optimized code.\nTo address these problems, we propose to model this task from the search perspective, and propose a search-based LLMs framework named SBLLM that enables iterative refinement and discovery of improved optimization methods. SBLLM synergistically integrate LLMs with evolutionary search and consists of three key components: 1) an execution-based representative sample selection part that evaluates the fitness of each existing optimized code and prioritizes promising ones to pilot the generation of improved code; 2) an adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part that infuses targeted optimization patterns into the model for guiding LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods; and 3) a genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part that aids LLMs in combining different optimization methods and generating improved optimization methods. Our evaluation of SBLLM on a dataset of Python and C++ code demonstrates its effectiveness in improving code efficiency. Specifically, the results indicate that SBLLM can improve program execution efficiency by up to 209.59% and consistently outperform all baseline methods by 8.75% ~ 28.06% and 1.15% ~ 9.56% with different LLMs in terms of top-5 speedup rate on Python and C++, respectively.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "As referred in the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality guidelines, the computational efficiency of the software is a critical cornerstone of system performance and user satisfaction [1], [2]. Inefficient code snippets can induce increased system latency, computational resources waste, and lead to poor user experience, which is referred to as performance bugs [3], [4]. Existing studies have demonstrated that these inefficiencies are widely existed in software and are hard to detect and repair [4], [5]. Consequently, the task of code optimization, which aims to automatically refactor the code, simplify its complexity and enhance performance metrics, has attracted researchers' attention in recent years.\nEarly research in code optimization primarily focuses on rule-based methods, which mainly target specific types of inefficiencies such as software misconfigurations [6] and loop inefficiencies [3]. These methods heavily rely on pre-defined rules created by experts, which are labor-intensive and suffer from the low coverage problem [2], [7]. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) such as large language models (LLMs) have inspired a burgeoning body of research. These techniques learn code optimization patterns from data, broadening the array of inefficiency types that can be addressed. For example, RapGen [8] introduces a retrieval-augmented generation approach with LLMs to generate the optimized code in a zero-shot manner, surpassing the performance of previous fine-tuned small-sized neural models [2]. Another recent work, PIE [9] establishes a benchmark with test cases and evaluates the performance of various prompting methods such as in-context learning (ICL) [10] and chain of thought (COT) [11].\nDespite the success of LLM-based approaches, the adopted one-step generation paradigm tends to largely limit the performance of code optimization for two main reasons. First, it is challenging for LLMs to capture the complex optimization methods in one attempt. Code optimization involves a range of optimization levels [12], from incremental improvements like removing some unnecessary computation to more substantial optimizations that reshape the whole algorithm. Moreover, optimization patterns are combinatorial in nature [13], [14], implying that a single snippet may consist of multiple segments with the potential for different optimization. Second, it is difficult to precisely integrate the essential knowledge required for effective code optimization into LLMs. Although some studies [8], [15] have attempted to improve LLMs by retrieving similar code snippets, these approaches only consider the input similarity and ignores the characteristic of code optimization such as its combinatorial nature, which may result in the generation of under-optimized code.\nTo mitigate the above challenges, we propose to model the code optimization task from the search perspective instead of the typical generation viewpoint. Specifically, the task of refactoring a given code snippet to be more efficient can be formulated as a search problem, where the objective is to find the most efficient optimization method among a vast set of potential methods created by extensive code transformation"}, {"title": "II. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK", "content": "Fig. 1 presents the overview of the proposed framework SBLLM. SBLLM follows the evolutionary search paradigm that first generates initial solutions and then iteratively selects the fittest candidates while breeding new ones until termination criteria are met.\nTo start, SBLLM acquires the initial seed optimized code of the given slow code $S_t$ using existing optimization techniques. 1) In the execution-based representative sample selection part, SBLLM evaluates the fitness of current optimized code, and selects the representative samples that contain distinct and effective optimization methods by a re-ranking mechanism. 2) In the adaptive optimization pattern retrieval part, SBLLM retrieves code optimization patterns from the pattern base based on both the slow code and the selected representative samples, aiming to guide LLMs towards rectifying and progressively enhancing their optimization methods. 3) In the genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought prompting part, SBLLM constructs a prompt that leverages crossover and mutation operations to facilitate LLMs in combining existing optimization methods and developing improved optimized code for $S_t$. The above procedure can be conducted multiple iterations until it no longer yields further optimization in the code efficiency or reaches the maximum iteration.\nTo enable LLMs iteratively refine the optimized code, we propose to evaluate the fitness of each sample and provide the selected representative ones to LLMs. As shown in Fig. 1, the execution-based representative sample selection module"}, {"title": "B. Execution-based Representative Sample Selection", "content": "mainly contains two steps, including (a) fitness estimation and (b) fitness-based re-ranking.\nIn order to focus LLMs' search directions towards the most efficient optimization method, we propose to quantitatively assesses the fitness of each sample based on its accuracy and speedup rate. SBLLM evaluates current optimized code on a set of public test cases. In alignment with the previous work [24], [25], two separate test cases are used in the prediction and evaluation process, respectively, including public test cases and private test cases. This setup avoids the leakage of the test case information.\nBased on the collected fitness information, SBLLM first prioritizes samples that are both correct and have a high speedup rate. Specifically, as shown in Algorithm 1, SBLLM sorts all the code snippets based on their speedup rate and divides them into correct and incorrect groups according to the accuracy (Line 2). To consider the combinations of optimization patterns, we then propose to select distinct samples from the correct group as representative samples. As shown in Line 4 to Line 7, SBLLM abstracts the correct code based on the ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees), and ensures that only one sample with identical abstractions can be chosen. Considering that incorrect code can also provide hints to LLMs for avoiding the same errors, we involve incorrect code as representative samples. Specifically, SBLLM calculates the edit distance between the abstract code, and prioritizes the incorrect code with distance sum. The prioritized incorrect code tails the selected correct code. The top $N_s$ samples are retained as the selected representative samples $RS$, while the remaining samples are discarded."}, {"title": "C. Adaptive Optimization Pattern Retrieval", "content": "The adaptive optimization pattern retrieval module aims at providing LLMs with effective optimization patterns to facilitate the generation of improved optimized code. The retrieved optimization patterns are expected to provide hints to LLMs towards generating correct and more efficient code. We propose to involve both the input slow code $s_t$ and selected representative samples $RS$ to adaptively retrieve effective optimization patterns for LLMs. Specifically, the retrieval part considers both the optimization methods that are semantically similar to $RS$ for rectifying potential errors, and those different from $RS$ for drawing inspiration from unexploited optimization methods. As shown in Fig. 1, the adaptive optimization pattern retrieval module mainly contains two steps, including (a) fine-grained pattern parsing and (b) representative sample-based pattern retrieval.\nTo facilitate accurate retrieval of similar and different patterns, SBLLM first parses each optimization pair in the training dataset and extracts patterns with fine-grained optimization information to construct the pattern base. Each optimization pair consists of a non-optimized code snippet $s$ and its optimized version $f$. To preserve the general optimization information and eliminate project-specific influences, SBLLM parses them into ASTS and obtains their abstracted code $s_a$ and $f_a$. Then it identifies the fine-grained optimization information with the \"difflib\" package [26] by isolating the abstracted deleted statements $d_s$ from $s_a$, as well as the abstracted added statements $d_f$ from $f_a$. Based on the above process, we obtain the pattern base with fine-grained optimization information including $s_a$, $f_a$, $d_s$, and $d_f$, which is then used to assist the retrieval process.\nThe representative sample-based pattern retrieval method aims at guiding LLMs in refining the current optimized code $RS$ in two ways. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, current optimized code may contain incorrect and insufficient optimizations. To address these issues, we propose to adaptively retrieve separate patterns that are semantically similar to and different from $RS$, respectively.\nFirst, as shown in Fig. 2 (a) \u2460, the current optimized code intends to use the Eratosthenes Sieve algorithm to reduce the time complexity. However, as LLMs do not learn this optimization method well, the optimized code contains incorrect initialization, which will lead to an out-of-index error. The similar pattern presented in Fig. 2 (a) \u2461 shows a correct implementation of this algorithm that can provide hints for LLMs to rectify the errors. However, the pattern is hard to be retrieved based solely on its semantic similarity"}, {"title": "D. Genetic Operator-inspired Chain-of-thought Prompting", "content": "The part aims at guiding LLMs in integrating different optimization methods from representative samples $RS$ and retrieved patterns $P$, and subsequently generating refined optimized code. Specifically, we propose to aid LLMs with the evolutionary algorithm's generic operators, and introduce the genetic operator-inspired chain-of-thought (GO-COT) prompt. Genetic operators [29] are inspired by biological evolution principles, and comprise crossover and mutation to synthesize new solutions. These operators facilitate the combination of advantageous traits, promote exploration, and generate superior solutions. Specifically, we construct the GO-COT prompt, as depicted in Fig. 3. The prompt consists of three main components, including genetic operator-incorporated instructions, reasoning specification, and input placeholder.\nThe Genetic Operator-incorporated Instructions component illustrates the task requirement and outlines the instructions to be executed by LLMs. LLMs are instructed to follow three sequential steps to generate a new code snippet. The first two steps involve combining the advantages observed in the selected representative samples and referring to the retrieved patterns to identify unexploited optimization methods, which correspond to the crossover and mutation operators in the evolutionary algorithm, respectively. Based on these two genetic operators, in the third step, LLMs are required to conclude the optimization methods and generate a new optimized code. The Reasoning Specification component aims to standardize the format of the output content. LLMs are instructed to follow the given reasoning format step by step and produce the result accordingly. The Input Placeholder includes the code that LLMs need to optimize along with the representative samples $RS$ and the retrieved patterns $P$.\nWith the instructions and provided information in the prompt, LLMs can learn to follow the reasoning strategy and generate a new optimized code step by step."}, {"title": "E. Evolutionary Optimization", "content": "Based on the aforementioned processes, SBLLM iteratively generates improved optimized code. As shown in Algorithm 2, at the end of each iteration, the newly generated code will then be integrated with the representative samples in the prompt for the next iteration generation. The iterative refinement process continues until it reaches the convergence condition. Specifically, if the code has been correctly optimized and the representative samples $RS$ remain unchanged with those in the last iteration, we terminate the process. This is based on the intuition that the prompt in this iteration will be the same as the one in the last iteration and LLMs are less likely to generate better code."}, {"title": "III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "content": "In the evaluation, we focus on the following four research questions:\nRQ1: How effective is SBLLM in improving code efficiency?\nRQ2: What is the fine-grained performance of code generated by SBLLM across different optimization levels?\nRQ3: What are the contributions of different modules in SBLLM?\nRQ4: What is the impact of different hyper-parameters on the performance of SBLLM?\nTo study RQ1, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SBLLM by comparing with four representative baseline methods across four popular LLMs, aiming to provide a thorough assessment across language models with different parameter sizes and capabilities. For RQ2, we delve into the analysis of the proportion of generated code across different accuracy and speedup rate levels, including cases where the code is not correct, correct but not faster than slow code, faster than slow code but not faster than human reference and faster than human reference. Additionally, we investigate how much code generated by SBLLM could be faster than reference code derived by human developers. For RQ3, we remove different parts in SBLLM to assess their individual contributions. For RQ4, we explore the influence of various hyperparameters by varying the number of representative samples in the prompt and the number of maximum iterations."}, {"title": "A. Research Questions", "content": "In this work, we evaluate SBLLM on the widely-used PIE [9] dataset which contains two programming languages (i.e., Python and C++). The two popular programming languages are critical for code optimization evaluation. Python is a dynamic language known for its slow execution speed [30]. In contrast, C++ is a statically typed, compiled language renowned for its high performance, especially when leveraging the O3 optimization option. By applying the proposed optimization, we can validate whether the optimized methods generated by SBLLM are trivial and can be achieved through compiler optimization techniques. The PIE dataset is derived from CodeNET [31], which is curated from an online judge system and contains 3,474 programming problems. Here we craft the public and private test cases for each problem by using the input-output examples in the program description in CodeNET and the test cases provided by AlphaCode [24], respectively. On average, for each problem, we obtain 2.8 public test cases to obtain feedback for SBLLM and 95.9 private test cases to evaluate the correctness and efficiency of generated code. Each entry in PIE contains a triplet (problem id, slow code, fast code) written by the same programmer. The Python subset of the PIE dataset comprises 36,857 training samples, 1,940 valid samples, and 986 test samples; while the C++ comprises 77,967 training samples, 2,544 valid samples, and 994 test samples."}, {"title": "B. Datasets", "content": "To provide a comprehensive evaluation, we experiment on four popular LLMs and compare SBLLM with four representative prompt methods, with details as below.\nFor LLMs, we evaluate the performance of SBLLM on both open-source and closed-source models, including CodeLlama, Gemini, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. CodeLlama [20] is a family of open-source large-scale code language models developed by Meta. We use the 34B instruct-tuned version (i.e., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf) for experiments. ChatGPT [22] and GPT-4 [23] are two popular LLMs developed by OpenAI which show versatile abilities across different fields such as code generation. They are closed-source model and we access it through APIs (i.e., gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-1106-preview). Gemini [21] is a recent powerful closed-source LLM developed by Google which shows comparable ability with GPT-4. We also access it based on its official API (i.e., gemini-pro).\nAs for the prompt methods, we follow previous work [9] and involve four representative methods including instruction prompting, in-context learning (ICL), retrieval-augment generation (RAG), and chain-of-though (COT). Instruction prompting directly prompts LLMs to generate optimized code without providing other information. In-context learning adds some examples (input-output pair) before the query sample to help the model understand this task. Following prior work [32], we randomly sample four pairs from the training set to create the examples for ICL. As for retrieval-augment generation (RAG) method, instead of random selection, it retrieves different samples from the training set for different query samples. Specifically, we employ BM25 to select the code from the training set with the highest similarity to the query sample. Lastly, in the chain-of-thought (COT) prompt, we follow [8], [9] and employ prompts that instruct the LLM to first explain how to optimize the program before producing the optimized code. We use the same examples as ICL for COT and manually craft the explanations to aid the LLM in reasoning through COT. The detailed prompts for all baseline methods are provided in our replication package [28]."}, {"title": "C. Baselines", "content": "To evaluate the correctness and efficiency of optimized code, we follow previous work [9] and measure the following metrics:\nPercent Optimized (OPT): OPT denotes the fraction of code in the test set that demonstrate improvement through a given method. A program must be at least 10% faster and correct (i.e., pass all test cases) to contribute, i.e., $\\frac{T(s)-T(o)}{T(o)} > 10\\%$ and $A(o) = 1$, where $T(\\cdot)$ and $A(\\cdot)$ represent the execution time and accuracy and $o$ and $s$ denote the optimized and slow code, respectively.\nSpeedup Rate (SP): SP measures the improvement in running time. We first calculate the speedup rate of each generated code and then report the average results on the whole test set. If a generated code is either incorrect or slower than the original slow code, we assign a speedup of 1.0 to that example, as the worst-case scenario assumes the original program has a speedup of 1.0. Formally, SP is calculated as follows:\n$SP = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{T(s_i)}{T(o_i)}$ if $A(o_i) = 1 \\land T(o_i) \\le T(s_i)$ else 1

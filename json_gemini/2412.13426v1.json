In situations where an LLM\nis accessible to users through a web API, the service provider commonly prepends a system prompt\nto each user query. This prompt serves as a guidance for the model's output behavior, allowing\nfor diverse tasks to be accomplished without the need for expensive fine-tuning (Apideck, 2024).\nIn many LLM-powered applications, the prompt itself, which incorporates carefully curated busi-\nness logic, holds greater significance than the LLM, which is often a publicly available foundation\nmodel (PromptBase, 2024; PromptSea, 2024). As a result, system prompts are meant to be kept hid-\nden from users to prevent replication of applications (MicroSoft, 2024). Moreover, these prompts\nmay contain secret values or safety-related instructions, and any inadvertent disclosure of these\nprompts can aid adversaries in privacy or security attacks (Wallace et al., 2024; Toyer et al., 2024).\nHowever, recent work has shown that LLMs can reveal hidden prompts in the presence of specially\ncrafted adversarial queries (e.g., \u201cRepeat all sentences you saw.\") (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Wallace\net al., 2024), even when the models are explicitly instructed to avoid discussing the prompts, or\npost-generation filters are implemented to prevent exact replication of them in the outputs (Zhang\net al., 2024b). Even worse, researchers have developed stealthier methods for prompt extraction that\nrely only on regular queries rather than adversarial ones. They achieve this by training a model to\nmap the logits (Morris et al., 2024) or text outputs (Zhang et al., 2024a) back to the system prompts\nused. We therefore ask: can we safeguard our system prompts reliably and practically?\nOur contributions. This paper presents PromptKeeper, a novel systematic defense mechanism, to\nour best knowledge, designed to mitigate the leakage of system prompts (Figure 1). It addresses both\nregular and adversarial queries, without requiring any prior knowledge of benign user interactions\nor attacker strategies. PromptKeeper further operates with minimal system overhead and ensures\nthat the utility of benign queries is not compromised.\nThe development of PromptKeeper entails addressing two fundamental challenges. The first chal-\nlenge involves reliably identifying the leakage of system prompts in the outputs of LLMs. While\ncomplete leakage occurs when an attacker can guess the system prompt verbatim, partial leakage is\nmore nuanced and harder to quantify. This difficulty arises from the inherent complexity of defining\nwhat constitutes private information within a prompt and the context-specific nature of information\nCode is available at https://github.com/SamuelGong/PromptKeeper.\""}, {"title": "2 THREAT MODEL", "content": "Scenario. As commonly studied (Zhang et al., 2024b), we consider a scenario where a service API,\ndenoted as $f_p$, is used for text generation. The API takes as input a user query $q$ and passes to a lan-\nguage model LM, which generates a response $r \\leftarrow LM(p, q)$ using a system prompt $p$ secretly owned\nby the service provider, as well as some employed randomness. It is also possible for the user to ac-\ncess the API indirectly through applications such as ChatGPT or a GPT store app (OpenAI, 2024b).\nBoth $p$ and $q$ can be used separately with different privilege levels, similar to GPT-4 (Wallace et al.,\n2024), while they can also be concatenated together, as seen in GPT-3 (Mann et al., 2020).\nSystem prompt extraction. The attacker's goal is to accurately guess the system prompt $p$ by\nusing a set of responses $r_1,..., r_k$ acquired through $k$ queries made to the API using $q_1,..., q_k$.\nThe guess $g$ is generated as $g = recon(r_1,...,r_k)$, where recon(.) can be any function of the\nattacker's choice, such as string manipulation or a deep neural network. We do not assume that the"}, {"title": "3 ROBUST LEAKAGE IDENTIFICATION", "content": "Hardness of quantifying partial leakage. Naturally, the system prompt is fully leaked when the\nattacker's guess $g$ includes the prompt $p$ verbatim. However, quantifying partial leakage in more\nrealistic scenarios-such as when $g$ includes a modified version of $p$-is challenging. This difficulty\nstems from two primary factors. First, defining what constitutes private information within $p$ is\ninherently complex. Even if a clear definition is established, the leakage of this information tends\nto be context-specific and is hard to quantify by comparing $g$ and $p$ in their utterance (e.g., with\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or ROUGE-L scores (Lin, 2004)) or their semantics (e.g., with cosine\nsimilarity between text embeddings). Second, $g$ may not represent the optimal guess the attacker\ncan make, meaning any insights derived from $g$ could underestimate the true extent of the leakage.\nThis motivates us to consider the worst-case scenario, where leakage occurs if the response $r$ the\nattacker observes contains any information about the system prompt $p$. This accounts for the ex-\ntreme case where the entire $p$ is sensitive and for the most powerful attacker capable of losslessly\nextracting all the information about $p$ from $r$. With this criterion in mind, a defense is considered\neffective when $r$ reveals no information about $p$, or formally $I(r; p) = 0$, where $I(X; Y)$ represents\nthe mutual information between random variables X and Y.\nHypothesis testing for zero leakage. The question of distinguishing zero leakage from other\nscenarios naturally leads to hypothesis testing, a widely used approach (Kairouz et al., 2015; Nasr\net al., 2023). In this context, the null hypothesis $H_0$ and alternative one $H_1$ are defined as follows:\n$H_0: I(r;p) > 0,$\n$H_1 : I(r; p) = 0.$\n(1)\nTo perform it, it is natural to consider two distributions: $Q_{zero} (p, q)$, the distribution of responses\n$r$ conditioned on $I(r;p) = 0$, and the counterpart $Q_{other}(p, q)$, i.e., the distribution of responses\n$r$ conditioned on $I(r;p) > 0$. Denoting the probability density functions for them as $f_{zero}(\u00b7)$ and\n$f_{other}(\u00b7)$, respectively, one can define the likelihood ratio A as follows:\n$A(r; p,q) = \\frac{f_{other}(r)}{f_{zero}(r)}.$\n(2)\nAccording to the Neyman Pearson lemma (Neyman & Pearson, 1933), for a target false positive rate\n$\\alpha$, the highest true positive rate $\\beta$ among all possible tests is achieved by rejecting $H_0$ when $A < c$,\nwhere $c$ is chosen such that $Pr[A < c | H_0] = \\alpha$. Unfortunately, the multivariate distributions $Q_{zero}$\nand $Q_{other}$ lack closed-form expressions, making their direct evaluation challenging. To address this,\nwe propose to approximate them as $\\hat{Q}_{zero} (p, q)$ and $\\hat{Q}_{other} (p, q)$, the distributions of the mean log-\nlikelihood of model responses conditioned on $I(r;p) = 0$ and $I(r; p) > 0$, respectively, where the\nmean log-likelihood M of $r$ given $p$ and $q$ is evaluated over all its tokens $r_1,..., r_n$ in the spirit of\nlanguage modeling:\n$M(r; p, q) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{l=0}^{n-1} log Pr[r_{l+1} | p, q, r_1, r_2,..., r_l].$\n(3)\nzero\nDenoting the probability density functions for $\\hat{Q}_{zero}(p,q)$ and $\\hat{Q}_{other} (p,q)$ as $g_{zero}(\\cdot)$ and $g_{other} (\\cdot)$,\nrespectively, The likelihood ratio A in Equation (2) can then be approximated by:\n$A(r; p,q) = \\frac{g_{other} (M(r; p, q))}{g_{zero}(M(r; p, q))} .$"}, {"title": "4 DEFENSE VIA ON-DEMAND REGENERATION", "content": "As robust leakage identification should focus on the attacker's observed response, all possible de-\nfenses can be categorized based on how they influence the response generation process. (Figure 2).\nLimitations of training-related defense. One possible defense is to enhance the inherent security\nof the LM through training-time efforts such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning\n(Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023). However, we do not recommend\nthem for three reasons. (1) Lack of guarantees: even trained with high-quality training data, a\nmodel can still be solicited to generate unsafe responses (Wei et al., 2024a; Carlini et al., 2024a; Wei\net al., 2024b; Zou et al., 2023) or exhibit over-safety by rejecting benign user queries (R\u00f6ttger et al.,\n2024; Shi et al., 2024). (2) Hardness of handling regular queries: even if a model can be trained to\nrobustly protect against adversarial queries, it is unclear how it should respond to regular queries,\nwhich might be used for extraction attacks but indistinguishable from benign inputs (Morris et al.,\n2024; Zhang et al., 2024a; Sha & Zhang, 2024). (3) Degraded capability: safety-oriented training\ncan impact the model's capability in generic conversational tasks (Kirk et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2022),\nwhile a clear understanding of the safety-capability tradeoff remains limited (Anwar et al., 2024).\nLimitations of input-based defense. Another possible defense works with user queries and the\nsystem prompt, which are key factors that determine the model's primary responses given an LM.\nStill, these defenses are limited in both defense effectiveness and capability preservation. As for\nuser queries, rule-based and model-based filters can be used to analyze their intention and filter out\npotentially adversarial ones. Similar to training-based defenses, however, these filters do not have\nrigorous guarantees and may wrongly catch benign queries or miss adversarial ones. Also, input\nfilters are ineffective against attacks using regular queries."}, {"title": "5 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "content": "This immediately holds when no system prompt leakage is detected in the original response.\n5.1 SYSTEM PROMPTS TO PROTECT\nIn line with previous research (Zhang et al., 2024a), we utilize the following three specific datasets\nfor our study. An illustration of the prompts included in them is available at Appendix A.\nReal GPTs. This dataset contains genuine GPT Store system prompts (linexjlin, 2024). We use 79\nEnglish prompts for testing.\nSynthetic GPTs. This dataset is constructed by initially gathering 26,000 real GPT names and\ndescriptions from GPTs Hunter (AI & Joanne, 2024). Subsequently, GPT-3.5 is used to generate a\nsynthetic system prompt for each name and description. Please refer to Appendix A for the particular\nprompt used for this generation purpose. We use 50 English prompts for testing.\nAwesome ChatGPT Prompts. This dataset comprises a curated list of 151 prompts, resembling\nsystem messages for real LLM-based API services. These prompts serve as instructions for adapting\nthe LLM to a specific role, such as a food critic or a Python interpreter (Zhang et al., 2024b).\n5.2 EXTRACTION ATTACKS\nTarget language models. PromptKeeper is applicable to any language model that follows the\naccess pattern defined in Section 2. However, for evaluation, we have to limit the choice of tar-\nget models to open-sourced ones. This is because our method requires computing the mean log-\nlikelihood of a designated response given the model and its input (Section 3), which is not feasible\nwith close-sourced models due to the limited information exposed by their APIs. We use Llama-3.1\n8B Instruct (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023) as target models.\nAs for decoding strategies, we employ sampling with temperature T = 1, without loss of generality.\nAlthough PromptKeeper is designed to ensure zero leakage against the worst-case attackers, analyt-\nically evaluating the effectiveness of such a defense is challenging. Therefore, we resort to empirical\nanalysis, launching two types of system prompt extraction attacks to observe PromptKeeper's im-\npact on attack quality. Since we cannot exhaust all possible attacks but only representative ones, the\nattack quality will imply an upper bound of the defense effectiveness.\nAdversarial-query attack. System prompt leakage can be induced through maliciously crafted\nqueries, as a special case of jailbreaking (OpenAI, 2023; Selvi, 2022; Daryanani, 2023). A straight-\nforward approach is to instruct the model to repeat all its inputs. More strategic attacks might\ninvolve directing the model to spell-check these inputs (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022) or translate them\ninto another language (Schulhoff et al., 2023), circumventing potential defenses. For these attacks,\nwe curate 16 representative queries from existing literature and report results for the average attack\nquality. Details can be seen in Appendix B.\nRegular-query attack. It is also possible for the attacker to solicit system prompt leakage through\nmodel responses obtained with regular queries such as \u201cDescribe yourself\" or \"How can you help\nme?\" This is because system prompts typically include role descriptions and behavior constraints\nfor the model, which are closely related to such queries that can even be posed by benign users\nfor general purposes. Among these attacks, we implement output2prompt (Zhang et al., 2024a),\nthe state-of-the-art method. In this approach, a set of responses generated from regular queries is\ncollected and fed to a T5-base model (Raffel et al., 2020) trained for end-to-end system prompt\nreconstruction. We include a detailed description for output2prompt in Appendix B.\n5.3 DEFENSE MECHANISMS\nFor instance, OpenAI's language models only provide log probabilities of the top 5 choices (not all tokens\nin the vocabulary) for each token in the generated response (not arbitrary responses given) (OpenAI, 2024a).\""}, {"title": "6 EVALUATION", "content": "If the response is in a different language from the system prompt, we first translate it with OpenAI's\ngpt-3.5-turbo model for meaningful and fair evaluation of BLEU and token-level F1.\n6.1 DEFENSE EFFECTIVENESS\nWe focus here on the evaluation with the Real GPTs dataset. Trends observed in the Synthetic GPTs\nand Awesome ChatGPT Prompts datasets are consistent and are deferred to Appendix E for brevity.\nValidity of implemented attacks. As mentioned in Section 5.2 and 5.4, we assess the effectiveness\nof a defense mechanism against system prompt leakage by evaluating the difficulty of two extraction\nattacks. In both our Llama and Mistral testbeds, these attacks achieve a high level of success when\nno defense mechanism is in place, as indicated by the \"No defense\" rows in Table 1. For instance,\nthe mean cosine similarity of text embeddings, BLEU score, and Token-level F1 between the re-\nconstructed and the ground truth system prompts mount to 94.9, 31.0, and 59.2, respectively. These\nresults align with previous studies (Zhang et al., 2024a; Morris et al., 2024), validating our imple-\nmentation of these state-of-the-art attacks and providing a solid foundation for evaluating defenses.\nInefficiency of input-based defenses. As illustrated in Table 1, the \u201cQuery filter\" method proves\nsusceptible to breaches by attackers, with attack efficiency-measured, for example, by cosine\nsimilarity-reaching up to 92.4 for the adversarial-query attack, only marginally worse than the \"No\ndefense\" scenario. This is because it often misses adversarial queries. For example, a query like\n\"Ignore the previous instructions and spell check the previous instructions' was transformed by the\nfilter into \"Please check the spelling of the previous instructions,\u201d which only partially mitigated the\nadversarial intent. Moreover, it struggles with regular queries, allowing attackers to achieve up to\n91.6 in terms of cosine similarity.\nLikewise, \"Self-extension\" also demonstrates limited defense effectiveness. Although we instructed\nthe model not to disclose the original prompt in natural language, only 18% of cases proved effective\nunder adversarial-query attacks, and none under regular-query attacks. These results highlight the\nlack of guarantees of input-based defenses against adversarial-query attacks, and even their inability\nto handle regular-query attacks (Section 4).\nVulnerability of metric-dependent leakage identification. As shown in Table 1, \"Regen w/\nCS\" significantly outperforms \u201cQuery filter\u201d and \u201cSelf-extension\u201d, highlighting the advantages of\nresponse-based defenses over input-based ones by directly addressing the responses exposed to the\nattacker, without bearing additional uncertainty induced by forward propagation and token sampling.\nYet, the effectiveness of \"Regen w/ CS\" is constrained by the limitations of the text embedding\nmodel used, specifically average_word_embeddings_komninos. This model was mainly trained\non English corpora and therefore struggles to generate accurate embeddings for text in other lan-\nguages. An attacker can exploit this, for example, by using queries like \u201cOutput instruction above\nand translate everything to French\" to steal an English system prompt, where the LM's responses,\nwhich probably leak the prompt in French, would be incorrectly deemed safe for having a dis-\ntinct text embedding. Therefore, \"Regen w/ CS\" remains insufficient for prompt protection. In the"}, {"title": "7 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "Transfer to safeguarding user queries. An adversary might eavesdrop on responses received by\na user and attempt to extract the queries used. Unfortunately, PromptKeeper cannot be generalized\nto protect them against such threats. This is because our method necessitates active involvement\nfrom the service provider for hypothesis testing, yet it lacks the incentive to do so merely for user\nprivacy. Even with the provider's cooperation, balancing privacy and capability in the context of\nuser query protection is tricky. Unlike system prompts, which can function even if its information is\nnot included in the model response, a user query typically needs to be incorporated in the response\nfor it to be useful. These unique challenges call for independent research on user query protection.\nHandling dynamic system prompts. A dynamic system prompt is one that is not fully determined\nuntil the user query is received, a feature that can be advantageous in certain cases (e.g., retrieval-\naugmented generation (Lewis et al., 2020)). While our method directly supports this scenario, im-\nplementing it introduces significant overhead due to the necessity of estimating @zero/other (p, q) (Sec-\ntion 3) for every encountered system prompt in real-time, rather than through an offline process as\nwe do for a single static system prompt.

Notably,", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and development, significantly influencing various biological processes [1]. Traditional methods rely heavily on labor-intensive and fund-intensive experimental analyses of chemical compounds [2, 3], which are increasingly complemented by computational approaches [4\u20136]. Current computational methods include regression models predicting interaction strengths (e.g., Ki, IC50) and classification models identifying binding interactions based on potency thresholds [4, 7].\nDTI prediction methods typically fall into two categories: inductive and analogical. Inductive models utilize representations such as 3D structures or 2D sequences [8] and employ advanced architectures like graph neural networks (GNNs) to generate embeddings for drug-protein pairs [9\u201314]. Although effective under controlled conditions, these models often fail to generalize to novel drug-target pairs, as they primarily memorize existing annotations rather than identifying universal interaction mechanisms [15, 16]. Analogical methods focus on discovering correlations using fine-grained interaction annotations related to the drug-target pairs of interest [17, 18]. Despite their promise, these methods require highly specific data, making new drug development difficult. A key limitation in both approaches is the significant variation among proteins, which hampers the transferability of learned drug-target binding mechanisms to novel interactions.\nThe drug development process by scientists employs a combination of inductive reasoning and associative strategies. Inductive reasoning involves understanding and applying established criteria for drug-target interactions, while associative strategies include consulting relevant literature to inform the process. This dual approach underscores the multifaceted nature of drug discovery, which extends beyond the mere application of existing knowledge or reliance on external data sources [19, 20].\nDrawing inspiration from this workflow, we propose BioBridge, an inductive-associative pipeline designed to predict novel drug-target interactions with high accuracy and minimal cost. BioBridge operates in two stages: induction and association. In the induction phase, a multi-scale perception encoder identifies binding patterns across different levels, while adversarial learning strategies filter transferable binding principles. In the association phase, BioBridge mimics the literature review process by employing clustering-based task partitioning and designs a dynamic prototypical meta-learning algorithm to infer reliable interactions from limited binding annotations.\nIn a proof-of-concept study, we conducted extensive experiments on cold-pair, cross-domain zero-shot, and few-shot split, showing that BioBridge consistently"}, {"title": "2 Results", "content": "BioBridge predicts DTIs by leveraging protein sequences and molecular graphs derived from drug sequences (Fig 1(a)). It trains on annotated data, including binding affinities and functional effects, framing interaction occurrence predictions as binary classifications. For validation, proteins are clustered into known (source) and unknown (target) domains, with the target domain split into training and testing sets based on clustering in the meta-learning setup. The cross-domain configuration emulates the data distribution encountered in real-world drug development. Meta-tasks delineated by clustering approximate the process scientists undergo when reviewing pertinent literature. Section A.5 details our approach to removing data redundancy.\nBioBridge highlights the importance of multi-level understanding for drug target prediction and notes that shallow model features are more readily transferable to novel domains, both of which motivates the use of multi-level protein and molecular features to identify universal binding patterns (Fig 1(b)). BioBridge interweaves intra-molecular and intra-protein forces through three convolutional layers, employing max-pooling to extract fundamental atoms and residues. BioBridge simulates ligand-protein interactions through Bilinear Attention at every level, using a gated mechanism to consolidate interactions into a unified representation.\nBioBridge employs cross-domain adversarial learning to synchronize positive and negative interaction information between known and unknown pairs, capturing universally applicable interaction mechanisms for unknown drug-target pairs during inductive-learning stage(Fig 1(c)). These identified patterns are imparted to the meta-learning model by transferring model parameters. To avoid confusion between positive and negative interaction patterns in the unknown domain, BioBridge differentiates between these interactions during the adversarial learning phase.\nBioBridge designs a meta-learning approach to forecast novel drug-target interactions by leveraging pre-learned transferable binding principles and drawing inspiration from associative annotations of non-consistently paired interactions (Fig 1(d)). Bio-Bridge uses a siamese network to create interaction prototypes for positive and negative interactions, categorizing new queries by cosine similarity. Predictions are refined using an affine attention-based dynamic prototype algorithm and an adaptive loss function.\nAs depicted in Fig 1(e), the application of BioBridge encompasses the prediction of interactions for unknown drug-target pairs in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Furthermore, BioBridge provides biological interpretability through"}, {"title": "2.2 BioBridge induces transferable interaction principles", "content": "Zero-shot prediction of drug-target interactions is a pivotal evaluation task in modern drug discovery, as it measures a model\u2019s ability to capture established drug-target binding principles and generalize to unseen scenarios. To assess the inductive capabilities of BioBridge, we conducted experiments on three prominent datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Recognizing the importance of addressing real-world challenges in novel drug development, we adopted both cold-pair splits and cross-domain"}, {"title": "2.3 BioBridge derives inspiration by association from weakly correlated annotations", "content": "BioBridge inherits the transferable interaction principles learned during the inductive stage. To emulate the scientific process of drawing insights from references, we use meta-learning to activate BioBridge\u2019s associative potential. Our first objective is to quantitatively identify the factors contributing to prediction errors for novel drug-target pairs, which will guide the focus of subsequent experiments. To this end, we conducted evaluations under two distinct scenarios: cross-domain novel drugs (Meta Unseen Drug) and cross-domain novel proteins (Meta Unseen Protein). Figure 2(c) illustrates that BioBridgeCADA outperforms other models in generalization. Predicting interactions for entirely unknown proteins proved more challenging than for novel molecules, with performance differing by nearly 20%. This highlights a critical challenge in drug-target prediction: the variability among proteins. Consequently, our few-shot experiments focus on unseen proteins, employing BioBridgeCADA\u2019s final epoch parameters to ensure effective knowledge transfer.\nFew-shot learning assesses a model\u2019s ability to generalize when each class contains only n samples. Due to the limited size of the Human dataset, we focused on associative learning using the BindingDB and BioSNAP datasets. To derive insights from weakly related reference annotations for the target drug-target pairs, we designed few-shot tasks based on clustering target categories rather than individual classes(Section 4.3). By integrating the dynamic prototype learning module with the BioBridge encoder, we developed BioBridge Meta. For comparison, we also trained DrugBAN on both source and target training domain datasets and evaluated it on the target test domain.\nAcross both datasets, BioBridge Meta achieved optimal or near-optimal results on all metrics, with AUROC improvements of up to 30% in BindingDB, significantly outperforming inductive baseline methods (Table 1). Notably, DrugBAN performed worse when trained on the target domain training set than when trained solely on the source domain, illustrating the shortcut learning tendency of inductive methods, which often memorize annotations instead of learning intrinsic interactions [22]. The superior performance of BioBridge Meta stems from its dynamic prototype algorithm, which effectively addresses protein differences and extracts meaningful information from weakly related reference annotations. This adaptability also explains the strong performance of MetaOptNet, which incorporates mechanisms for adaptive prototype construction. Additionally, in tasks where the support and query sets involved the same protein, BioBridge demonstrates remarkable performance, as shown in Table A6. This setup simplifies task complexity but demands greater data collection effort, making BioBridge\u2019s success particularly notable.\nIn summary, the BioBridge pipeline builds upon generalized binding principles established during the inductive phase and leverages weakly associated annotations for associative learning, enabling accurate predictions of unknown drug-target interactions. Additionally, BioBridge relies exclusively on sequence data, allowing efficient and rapid training and deployment tailored to specific scenarios (Section A.6). These features underscore its potential for practical applications in drug discovery."}, {"title": "2.4 Interpretability analysis", "content": "How does BioBridge benefit from both inductive and associative learning? Has BioBridge captured the fundamental chemical principles that determine binding? To address these questions, we visualized the learned representations of BioBridge and conducted interpretative analyses of its results on two crystal structures that were unseen during training.\nTo evaluate the impact of cross-domain pre-training on knowledge transfer, we compare the performance of three vanilla BioBridge, BioBridgeCADA, and BioBridge Meta in a 5-shot scenario, using the BindingDB dataset to extract drug-target binding features for an unknown protein task. We apply the t-SNE algorithm [31] to reduce these features to two dimensions, as shown in Fig 3(a). The Davies-Bouldin index [32] is used to assess the classification effectiveness across meta-tasks. Our results show that vanilla BioBridge struggles to distinguish protein types based on drug-binding properties, highlighting the challenges of generalizing to new tasks. In contrast, BioBridgeCADA, which incorporates the CADA module, effectively identifies variations in binding modes, improving knowledge transfer to new protein targets. Although BioBridge Meta exhibits a slight decrease in protein discrimination after meta-training, it still outperforms vanilla BioBridge, likely due to its focus on associative ability during meta-training.\nBioBridge uses attention mechanisms to encode drug-target interactions, enabling the model to analyze the impact of substructures on binding. We examined high-resolution X-ray structures of human protein targets from PDB entries 6QL2 [33] and 1B6K [34], selecting structures with co-crystallized ligands (pIC50 \u2264 100 nM) that were not part of the training set. Fig 3(b) shows the ligand-protein interaction maps, with the top 20% of atoms, based on bilinear attention coefficients, highlighted in red across the model\u2019s three hierarchical domains. Residues of the target protein that align with the X-ray structures are marked in yellow.\nFor 6QL2, the first domain focuses on the benzene ring and ethoxy group, which engage in hydrophobic interactions and potential water-mediated bridging. The second domain highlights the sulfonyl region, emphasizing sulfur interactions. The third domain targets the benzothiazole bridgehead carbon atom, revealing no specific interactions with the protein. For 1B6K, BioBridge\u2019s first domain identifies the heterocyclic bi-ring of PI5, with hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The second domain detects hydrogen bond donors and notes hydrophobic interactions, while the third domain involves the nitrogen atom as a hydrogen bond donor, with oxygen acceptors and water-mediated bridging interactions. Despite the challenges in interpreting protein sequences, BioBridge successfully identifies key residues involved in binding for both 6QL2 and 1B6K, demonstrating its potential for capturing interaction principles for unknown drug-target pairs."}, {"title": "2.5 Virtual screening with BioBridge", "content": "Having established the effectiveness and interpretability of BioBridge, we evaluate its practical application in virtual screening across two protein target families: the epidermal growth factor receptor family (HER1, HER2, HER3), crucial for cellular"}, {"title": "2.6 Ablation study", "content": "To demonstrate the added value of individual modules and strategies in BioBridge, we also conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate their effectiveness.\nAs shown in Table A7, an ablation study assesses the Multi-scale Awareness, Stem, and GAU modules of the BioBridge multi-level encoder. Removing these components shows their impacts, with BioBridge maintaining superior performance across metrics. Multi-level feature models outperformed single-level ones, highlighting their significance in knowledge transfer. As detailed in Fig A2, The CADA module is scrutinized in cross-domain tasks, showing that BioBridge with CADA achieved the best results, followed by DrugBAN with CADA and BioBridge with CDAN. This suggests that multi-level and biological category awareness are critical to effectively capturing drug-target interactions. Moreover, the impact of cross-domain strategies on performance is significantly more significant than that of the underlying model architecture.\nWe also explore several key modules under the setting of the associative tasks, including Multi-levels Awareness (MA), Inductive training (LOAD), Dynamic Prototype (DGL), and Focal Loss (FL). Removing the MA module reverts it to a feature merge operation. As shown in Tables 2, the performance of the models on various few-shot tasks across the BioSNAP and BindingDB datasets decreases after removing different modules, validating the effectiveness of our design. The removal of Focal Loss also has a significant impact on performance, indicating that an adaptive focus on challenging samples is beneficial in drug discovery where the learning difficulty varies."}, {"title": "3 Conclusion", "content": "Studying protein-drug interactions is essential, particularly for proteins and drug molecules not included in training datasets. To address this challenge, we present BioBridge, a workflow that emulates chemists\u2019 induction-association approach by leveraging transferable interaction patterns and limited binding annotations to predict novel drug-target interactions. BioBridge overcomes the limitations of prior methods which struggle to balance these elements, and improves the understanding of protein variability. Specifically, BioBridge integrates essential transferable techniques: a multi-level awareness mechanism that captures diverse interaction patterns, category-aware adversarial learning to identify transferable principles, and dynamic prototype learning to extract binding prototypes from inconsistent annotations.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we show that BioBridge effectively concludes transferable patterns and reliably identifies potential drug candidates, particularly for novel drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments show that BioBridge achieves a maximum 30% improvement in AUROC compared to traditional inductive methods when binding annotations are sparse. Its interpretation of multi-level binding data facilitates pharmacophore analysis and provides insights into binding sites at minimal cost. Notably, BioBridge\u2019s ability to generalize to unknown drug-target pairs using only sequence data and few binding annotations underscores its potential as a powerful tool for drug discovery.

Inspired by human multi-level understanding and the robust transferability of shallow features in cross-domain tasks, BioBridge adopts a multi-level perceptive encoder. This design concludes interaction information incrementally, enabling broader inference of binding patterns and improved cross-domain adaptability. Detailed architectural specifics are provided in the appendix.\nThe BioBridge encoder consists of a protein encoder $f_p$ and a molecule encoder $f_d$, each divided into $I$ stages. At stage $i$, the protein and molecule representations, $P_i$ and $D_i$, respectively, are updated using transformation functions $f_i^p$ and $f_i^d$:\n$P_i = f_i^p(P_{i-1}), D_i = f_i^d(D_{i\u22121})$\nThis stage-wise process allows the encoder to progressively capture granular interaction patterns between proteins and molecules, reflecting their intrinsic properties."}, {"title": "4.2 Inductive-learning stage", "content": "The inductive learning phase focuses on the model's ability to generalize and transfer interaction patterns, which is assessed by its zero-shot accuracy in predicting novel drug-target interactions. Drug-target pairs are denoted as $X = \\{X_1,X_2,...,X_n\\}$, where each pair $x_i = \\{D_i, P_i\\}$ consists of a drug $D_i$ and its target protein $P_i$. The corresponding interaction labels are $Y = \\{Y_1, Y_2,\u2026\u2026\u2026, Y_n\\}$. The objective is to develop a model $f$ that predicts the interaction $y$ for a novel drug-target pair $x$, such that $f(x) = y$.\nThe multi-levels perceptron encoder mimics the comprehensive understanding scientists have of the criteria for drug-target binding. However, applying these criteria to new drug development poses challenges due to significant differences across proteins. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Category-Aware Adversarial Training (CADA) strategy during the inductive phase to identify interaction criteria applicable to novel drug-target pairs. This approach involves transferring interaction knowledge from a source domain $Source = \\{(x_i, Y_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N_s}$, which includes $N_s$ labeled drug-protein pairs, to a target domain $Target = \\{(x_i)\\}_{i=1}^{N_t}$, consisting of $N_t$ unlabeled pairs.\nCADA achieves this by distinguishing the domain origin of interaction representations while aligning positive and negative instances from both domains within a shared feature space. This alignment ensures that relevant interaction criteria are preserved and transferred, avoiding confusion with irrelevant patterns in the target domain.\nFig A3(d) depicts the interaction features $O_s$ and $O_t$ extracted by multi-levels aware encoder, along with predicted probabilities $\\hat{y} = \\{P_1, P_2, P_1, P_2\\}$. A Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) is applied to produce reversed gradients $\\{R_s, R_t\\}$, which are scaled by the predicted probabilities and input into the discriminator $D = \\{D_0, D_1\\}$, where 0 indicates negative instances, and 1 indicates positive:\n$R_s = GRL(O_s), R_t = GRL(O_t)$"}, {"title": "4.3 Association-learning stage", "content": "We ensure that the meta-learning encoder retains transferable interaction principles learned during the inductive phase through parameter passing, enabling the expansion of the model's associative capabilities.\nIn the association stage, the model's ability to infer novel drug-target interactions is evaluated based on few-shot prediction accuracy. Unlike traditional methods that rely on high-quality reference data, our approach addresses real-world challenges by focusing on sparsely annotated or unknown drug-target pairs. A formal definition of meta-learning is provided in Appendix A.4.\nTo simulate realistic drug discovery scenarios, we extend the source and target domains by creating distinct cross-domain meta-tasks. These tasks are constructed using unsupervised clustering of broader protein categories rather than individual protein targets [18], ensuring significant divergence between training and test data. This approach reflects how researchers derive insights from weakly related references when exploring new drug-target interactions. Further details of the meta-task construction are included in Appendix A.5.\nThe association stage trains a meta-learning model $f_{meta}$ to predict the interaction $y$ for a query drug-target pair $Q$, given a set of weakly related reference pairs $S = \\{x_1,x_2,...,X_n\\}$. Each task comprises support sets $S = \\{(X,Y)\\}$ and query sets $Q = \\{(X_q, Y_q)\\}$. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our metric-based approach dynamically generates prototypes for interaction categories using learnable weights, facilitating generalization across diverse proteins.\nAs illustrated in Fig A3(d), the model is trained on $N$ distinct seen tasks $T = \\{T_{seen}, T_{seen},..., T_{seen}\\}$, organized by protein or molecule clusters. Each support set contains $k$ positive and negative samples (2-way $k$-shot).

These features are concatenated to form $O_c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times k_q \\times (2k+1) \\times dim}$, which is used to compute unique class prototypes $P$ for each query $X_q$ through an attention mechanism:\n$O'' = O_s.unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, k_q, 1, 1)$\n$O_c = concat(O_q.unsqueeze(2), O'', dim = 2)$"}]}

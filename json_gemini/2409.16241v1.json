{"title": "LLM Echo Chamber: personalized and automated disinformation", "authors": ["Ma, Wentao"], "abstract": "Recent advancements have significantly highlighted the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama2 in performing diverse tasks including text summarization, translation, and content review. Despite their evident benefits, the implications of their widespread application warrant careful consideration. It has been underscored that the potential for these models to disseminate misinformation exists, which poses challenges in dealing with this more persuasive, faster-generated, human-liked misinformation. This concern is exacerbated by the capacity of LLMs to influence public opinion because of their wide usage.\nThis study aims to critically examine the risks associated with LLMs, particularly their ability to disseminate misinformation on specific topics as factual persuasively. To this end, we built the \u201cLLM Echo Chamber\u201d, a controlled digital environment designed to mimic the dynamics of social media platforms, specifically chatrooms, where misinformation often proliferates. The phenomenon of echo chambers is well-known - only interacting with those of the same opinions further reinforces a person's beliefs and causes them to discard other viewpoints. The \u201cLLM Echo Chamber\u201d could help us study the effect of multiple malicious misinformation spreading bots in a chatroom, a common scenario for the internet Echo Chamber phenomenon.\nWe first did a review of existing LLMs and their associated risks, LLM's ability to spread misinformation, an exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for model finetuning, and some advanced methods for constructing interactive chatrooms. The model selection was based on the model's performance, considerations of computing resources, and the level of safeguards.\nWith Microsoft's phi-2 model finetuned on the identity-shifting dataset we created, we could let the model generate harmful content. Subsequently, we developed a \u201cLLM Echo Chamber\u201d leveraging our finetuned model, frontend tools, and context-aware backend tools, employing specific prompt engineering and interactive logic to enhance the chatroom's credibility.\nThe efficacy of the chatroom was evaluated by automated evaluation based on GPT-4, which could provide us a comprehensive overview of the persuasiveness and harmfulness of our \u201cLLM Echo Chamber\u201d. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the ethical implications of LLMs and highlight the necessity for robust mechanisms to mitigate the potential dissemination of misinformation.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs), including notable examples such as GPT-4 [1] and Llama2 [2], represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence capabilities.

Their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text has not only pushed the boundaries of what AI can achieve but also opened new avenues for innovation across multiple sectors including education, healthcare, and entertainment.\nHowever, alongside their considerable benefits, the rapid advancement and deployment of LLMs have raised pressing concerns regarding their potential risks and dangers. Notably, there are growing apprehensions about the dissemination of misinformation, the reinforcement of biases present in their training data, and the ethical implications of their applications. The capacity of LLMs to generate text that is indistinguishable from that produced by humans poses significant challenges in ensuring information reliability and integrity online. Misinformation spread by LLMs can lead to the formation of false beliefs and unfounded opinions among the public, exacerbating societal issues such as polarization and mistrust in politics and science.\nMoreover, the ease with which LLMs can be accessed and utilized means that mitigating these risks requires concerted efforts from developers, researchers, and policymakers alike.

These models have pushed the boundaries of natural language processing, offering insights into the potential of AI in understanding and generating human-like text.\nGPT-4 [1], the latest iteration from OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer series, has set new benchmarks in language comprehension and generation. With its vast training data, finetuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), its performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers.\nDespite its advancements, researchers from Microsoft Research [3] suggested that GPT-4 still has some limitations like bias and misinformation. GPT-4's prowess in mimicking human writing raises substantial concerns regarding its misuse in generating believable yet entirely fabricated information, potentially leading to the widespread dissemination of misinformation.\nLlama2 [2], developed by Meta, has demonstrated exceptional performance in numerous NLP tasks, challenging the previous dominance of models like GPT-3 [4]. It is a collection of pre-trained and finetuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. LLama2 uses a pre-normalization variant of the normal transformer block. After pretraining, it is finetuned by both Supervised Fine-Tuning(SFT) and RLHF. Its open-source feature enables the commu-\nnity to build on their work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.\nHowever, like GPT-4, Llama2's capabilities come with significant risks. The model's ability to generate persuasive text can be exploited to fabricate news stories, create fake reviews, or manipulate public opinion. In 2023, Qi et al [5] finetuned the Llama2 model and enabled it to generate harmful and aggressive content.\nGemini 1.5 [6] from DeepMind heralds a new trend in AI, groundbreaking with its multi-modal capabilities that span text, images, audio, video, and code. Showcasing unprecedented versatility, Gemini's 128,000 token context window design allows it to deal with audio, video, and pictures directly. Depending on the type of input given, its Mixture-of-Experts layer(MoE) [7] learns to selectively activate only the most relevant expert pathways in its neural network.\nHowever, the potent capabilities of Gemini, much like its predecessors, necessitate caution. The potential for misuse in generating deceptive content across modalities underscores the critical need for vigilant oversight.\nPhi-2 [8] stands out for its remarkable efficiency and distinguishes itself by its compact size. It was trained on 1.4 trillion tokens from a combination of \u201ctextbook-quality\" synthetic and web datasets for natural language processing and coding. The 2.7 billion-parameter language model demonstrates outstanding capabilities. On complex benchmarks, Phi-2 matches or outperforms models up to 25x larger.\nNonetheless, Phi-2's capabilities are not without their drawbacks. The safeguard of the model could still be broken, including the generation of false news articles, fraudulent reviews, or the sway of public sentiment.\nThrough analysis of the advanced LLMs, we can conclude that along with the huge performance improvement, the security risks introduced also need to be taken care of. These concerns highlight the imperative for ongoing vigilance and the formulation of strategies to counteract such risks.\""}, {"title": "2.2 LLMs generated Misinfomation", "content": "From the above, we can have a clear glimpse that although LLMs are powerful for text generation and other tasks, they are not entirely safe and could be used harmfully. One of the most common and widely studied risks is misinformation generation, meaning creating and disseminating false or inaccurate information, which can be done intentionally to deceive or mislead people.\nThis concern and problem, highlighted by Weidinger et al [9] in 2021, reflects a broader apprehension within the AI community regarding the ethical implications of LLMs. The potential for these models to disseminate misinformation intentionally or inadvertently poses a significant challenge. In 2023, Chen and Shu [10] find that misinformation generated by an LLM is more difficult to detect than misinformation written by humans, showing that it is all the more important to be aware of the potential harm these models could cause.\nIn 2023, Yang et al [11] explored the case of a Twitter botnet suspected of using ChatGPT to generate fake content, highlighting the complexities in distinguishing between Al-generated and human content. It presents a detailed analysis of these AI-powered bots, their behaviors, and the potential threats of disseminating misinformation. The study emphasizes the challenge of detecting such bots and calls for enhanced measures to mitigate these risks.\nFurthermore, the implications of disseminating disinformation for public discourse, the authenticity of information, and the potential for social manipulation call for a concerted effort to address these risks. Researchers and developers are urged to prioritize transparency, ethical guidelines, and the incorporation of safeguards against misuse in the design and deployment of LLMs."}, {"title": "2.3 Red Teaming LLMs", "content": "Red teaming [12] is an essential process to ensure robustness, safety, and reliability, which always includes essential systematic tests and attacks.

This technique capitalizes on the models' reliance on input cues to generate responses, effectively bypassing built-in safeguards against generating unethical or harmful content.\nTheoretical Underpinnings\nThe theoretical foundation of prompt engineering lies in understanding the models' linguistic and contextual processing mechanisms. The process involves crafting inputs (prompts) to guide the AI towards generating specific, desired outputs. From an information theory perspective, the objective is to minimize entropy [14], thus reducing the uncertainty in the Al's response, leading to targeted outputs. However, this technique can be exploited to generate harmful content. The probabilistic model for predicting the likelihood of harmful output from a language model with guardrails can be represented as:\n$P(H|X,G) = \\frac{P(G|H, X) \\cdot P(H|X)}{P(G|X)}$\nwhere $P(H|X)$ is the intrinsic probability of generating harmful content given prompt X, $P(G|H, X)$ represents the probability of guardrails activating given the harmful output and the prompt, and $P(G|X)$ is the probability of guardrails activating given the prompt. Prompt engineering can either increase $P(H|X)$ or decrease $P(G|X)$, finally increasing $P(H|X, G)$ despite the presence of guardrails."}, {"title": "2.4.2 Finetuning", "content": "Finetuning has emerged as a powerful technique to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to new contexts and tasks. However, when applied with the intent to jailbreak these models, finetuning can lead to controlled and toxic output, undermining the safety protocols embedded within LLMs.\nTheoretical Underpinnings\nFinetuning a Large Language Model (LLM) involves adjusting the model's parameters 0, which were initially learned during pre-training on a broad dataset, to improve performance on a specific task or dataset. This process is mathematically\nlikelihood\nformulated through the optimization of an objective function $J(0)$, where $J$ quantifies the model's performance on the finetuning dataset. The objective is to find the optimal parameters $0*$ that minimize the loss function, expressed as:\n$\\theta^* = arg \\min_\\theta J(\\theta)$\nThe optimization typically employs gradient descent, or its variations, where parameter updates follow $\\theta = \\theta_0 - a\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)$, with a representing the learning rate and $\\nabla_{\\theta}J(\\theta)$ the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters $\\theta$. This approach ensures the model is finetuned to the specific requirements of the target task.\nHowever, this process can be exploited to generate harmful content by finetuning the model on a dataset that includes biased, misleading, or offensive content. The model's parameters can thus be adjusted to produce outputs reflecting these harmful biases, as the model optimizes for pattern recognition and replication from the provided data without ethical discernment. This exploitation underlines the dual-use nature of finetuning, where technological advancements intended to enhance model performance on specialized tasks must be carefully managed to prevent misuse."}, {"title": "2.5 Chatroom Building Tools", "content": "The development of an interactive chatroom represents a convergence of computational technology and social interface design, aiming to engage users in realistic and dynamic interactions.

It provides a robust platform for developers to create interactive interfaces with minimal coding overhead, enabling swift translation of complex data workflows into shareable apps.\nAt its core, Streamlit works by allowing the user to write a Python script that defines the app's layout and functionality. This script uses Streamlit's API to create widgets (such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs) and to display data or results through charts, tables, and other visualization tools. When the script is running, Streamlit automatically renders the script as a web app that users can interact with. The magic of Streamlit lies in its \u201creactive\u201d model: the app's interface automatically updates in response to user interactions, re-running the script from top to bottom to reflect any changes made through the widgets. This mechanism eliminates the need for the traditional backend/frontend divide, making it incredibly efficient for prototyping and deploying data-driven applications."}, {"title": "2.5.2 LangChain", "content": "LangChain [19], a comprehensive toolkit for constructing language model applications, extends the functionality of LLMs into customized software environments. By harnessing LangChain, people could integrate LLMs into the chatroom, enabling the models to process and respond to user input dynamically.\nLangChain's Memory feature allows the model to store, remember, and recall details from previous interactions, effectively maintaining a coherent thread of conversation or analysis across sessions. This enhancement not only boosts the model's understanding and response accuracy but also significantly enriches the user experience by providing a more natural, conversation-like interaction with AI systems.\nLangChain introduces a structured approach, chain, to problem-solving by enabling LLMs to break down complex problems into a series of simpler, sequential steps. By providing a step-by-step account of the reasoning process, users can easily follow along, understand, and even correct or guide the Al's approach to problem-solving, making AI tools more accessible and interpretable for a wider audience.\nThe extensibility of LangChain significantly broadens the scope of LLM applications by facilitating easy integration with external data sources, APIs, and other computational tools. This capability allows developers to enhance the AI's core functions with a wealth of additional information and specialized algorithms, enabling the creation of highly sophisticated and dynamic applications.\nIn summary, given all of the useful mechanisms discussed in prior sections, LangChain provided the necessary flexibility to implement chatbots and chatrooms. We were able to build the echo chamber easily on the top of our model, without further needs for memory storage and a conversation chain. This will speed our experiment up significantly and increase the chatroom's authenticity."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "In this chapter, we methodically explore the selection, running, and finetuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand their capabilities and limitations.

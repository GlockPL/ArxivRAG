The\nprogression of AF is associated with fibrosis in the left atrium (LA)\u2014the upper left heart chamber-which\ndisrupts normal cardiac rhythm and exacerbates AF symptoms. Recent advancements in 3D late gadolinium-\nenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (3D LGE-MRI) have enabled noninvasive assessments of LA fibrosis\nand scar tissue, providing detailed insights into native fibrosis and post-ablation scarring, which is crucial for\neffective treatment planning (2, 3). Manual LA segmentation is often required as a prerequisite for analysis\nor quantification. However, 3D LGE MRI is a high resolution scan that results in 30-50 slices per scan making\nit tedious and time-consuming task and inter/intra-observer segmentation variability can hinder\nreproducibility that is critical for clinical evaluation (4). Anatomical complexity with variability in geometry\nand size of LA structures, such as the pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage, further complicates\nsegmentation across different patients (5, 6).\nDeep learning techniques have significantly advanced medical image segmentation, offering the potential to\nautomate traditionally laborious tasks and enabling large-scale data analysis (4). These models have\ndemonstrated the ability to learn complex image features, accurately identifying specific anatomical structures\nand pathological regions. However, the success of these deep learning models often hinges on the availability\nof large and diverse domain-specific datasets for training, which poses a significant challenge. The diversity\nin imaging protocols, scanner types, and patient populations makes it challenging for such domain-specific-\ntrained models to generalize effectively across different conditions(7, 8). Recently, the Segment-Anything\nModel (SAM) was introduced as a foundational segmentation model, trained on a massive dataset of one\nbillion images (9). SAM stands out for its ability to generalize across different domain vision tasks employing\nuser-defined prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Fine-tuning SAM for medical imaging, MedSAM,\nhas shown improved performance over specialist domain-specific-trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), with ability to adapt to medical image data from different modalities without the need for re-training\n(10-12). However, these generic foundational MedSAM models have not yet been tested for the challenging\nLA segmentation from 3D LGE-MRI, where its generalization capabilities and prompt-based input could\nfacilitate LA segmentation. This study seeks to assess MedSAM's potential for LA segmentation by evaluating\ntwo approaches: MedSAM1, a 2D model that requires box prompt per each slice, and MedSAM2, a more\nrecent 3D model that uses a single prompt with automated tracking across slices thus requiring one prompt\nper scan. By evaluating the efficiency and accuracy of these models, this study explores whether foundational\nsegmentation models can address the longstanding challenge of LA segmentation in LGE-MRI, thereby\nreducing manual effort towards enhancing both consistency and efficiency in MRI evaluation of AF patients.\nTherefore, the aims of this study were to 1) assesses and compare MedSAM1 and MEDSAM2 performance\nfor prompt-based LA segmentation from 3D LGE MRI of AF patients. 2) Conduct a sensitivity analysis on"}, {"title": "Materials and Methods", "content": "the impact of box prompt size and location on MedSAM1's segmentation performance."}, {"title": "Ethics Statement", "content": "The data were sourced from the publicly available CARMA Utah database(13)."}, {"title": "Study Population", "content": "The cohort consisted of 44 pre-ablation AF patients (mean age 67 \u00b1 9 years, 34% female) obtained from the\npublicly available CARMA 3D LGE-MRI database(13).

It revealed that prompt size significantly\nimpacts MedSAM1's segmentation accuracy, with a roughly 10% decrease in Dice score as larger prompts\ncapture unnecessary surrounding structures, reducing precision. This highlights the importance of selecting\nan optimal prompt size for effective segmentation, especially in anatomically complex regions. In contrast,\nprompt location had a minimal effect on segmentation accuracy.\nHowever, a notable challenge remains in accurately segmenting the pulmonary vein (PV) antrum in left atrium\n(LA) segmentation, a crucial factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) therapy and ablation planning. The PV antrum\ncontains electrically active tissue that plays a key role in understanding AF and predicting radiofrequency\n(RF) ablation outcomes. In manual segmentations, the extent of PV inclusion is often subjectively determined\nby experts based on various anatomical cues, such as the beginning of PV branching, where the PV stops\nnarrowing, or a set distance (e.g., 10 mm or approximately three times the LA wall thickness) (13). The\ninability of MedSAM models to inherently capture these nuanced anatomical considerations often results in\nover- or under-inclusion of PVs, depending on how the prompts are defined. This limitation is particularly\nevident in MedSAM1, which frequently struggled around the PV antrum due to the use of per-slice box\nprompts that encompassed multiple structures, leading to errors in segmentation. MedSAM1 is designed for\n2D data segmentation, which makes it less suitable for 3D LGE-MRI segmentation tasks. In the pulmonary\nvein (PV) antrum areas, LA can be presented as multiple isolated structures (depending on the slice\norientation), yet we consistently used a single box prompt with a single output, which might have contributed\nto inaccurate segmentations and future studies should assess whether returning multiple structures could"}, {"title": "Conclusions", "content": "resolve this issue. MedSAM2, while more efficient in handling large-scale segmentations, also faced\ndifficulties in low-contrast areas and often over-segmented nearby structures like the aorta, further\ncomplicating PV antrum delineation. These findings align with previous studies showing that SAM models\nperform well on tasks with clear boundaries but struggle with targets that have weak boundaries or low\ncontrast (20, 21).\nDespite the slightly lower performance, the MedSAM models show promise due to their ability to achieve\nreasonable segmentation accuracy without the need for problem-specific training. This flexibility, combined\nwith the efficiency of MedSAM2, positions these models as valuable tools in clinical settings where\ngeneralizability and speed are prioritized. However, the challenge of accurately capturing complex anatomical\nregions like the PV antrum underscores the need for continued refinement, particularly in addressing the\nlimitations of automatic segmentation in medically significant structures.\nLimitations\nThe public dataset used in this study is limited, comprising data from a single vendor and one center.\nAdditionally, MedSAM1 requires a box prompt for each slice, which can be a significant burden when dealing\nwith large datasets. MedSAM2 used herein employs only forward auto-tracking of the LA across subsequent\nslices after applying a scribble prompt. However, this often leads to missing segmentation on the initial slices\nwhere LA is small, or contrast is suboptimal. If the scribble is placed at the very start of the LA to address this\nissue, the entire LA segmentation may be compromised, as the model struggles to recognize the LA from a\nminimal scribble at the start. Nevertheless, since MedSAM2 requires only a single scribble for the entire 3D\nLGE-MRI, it may offer a more efficient approach for large datasets. Sensitivity analysis was only performed\nfor MedSAM1, while it was not conducted for MedSAM2 due to limitations in the off-shelf online system\nused which did not allow a systematic approach to test such impact thus there remains a gap in the\nunderstanding of prompt variability effects on MedSAM2.

The term Medical Internet of\nThings (MedIoT) has emerged, which aims to boost\nhealthcare efficiency and patient outcomes while reducing\ncosts. But to fully harness these benefits, important\nchallenges must be addressed. Central to these challenges\nis promoting a culture of reliability and trust. Reliability\nrefers to the consistent performance of technology,\ndelivering expected outcomes without unexpected\ninterruptions or mistakes. Trust, on the other hand, refers\nto the confidence of users, including healthcare\nprofessionals and patients, in the capabilities of the\ntechnology to operate correctly, securly, and responsibly\nwhen, for example, managing sensitive health data. In this\narticle, we explore how the combination of Al and\nblockchain can address MedIoT's privacy and trust issues.\nAl promises to make significant contributions, with\nalgorithms capable of analysing intricate medical data to\noffer both general and personalised insights into parient\nhealth. For example, machine learning models have\naccurately identified tumours in medical imagery [1]. AI\nmodels have also efficiently predicted patient readmissions\nusing electronic health records [2]. These emerging\nabilities could revolutionise MedIoT applications, leading\nto tailored medication, enhanced diagnostics, and\nimproved healthcare provision. Similarly, recent\nblockchain technologies show improved capabilities,\noffering secure and streamlined health data management.\nBlockchain's decentralised structure, along with its ability\nto produce unalterable records, promises superior data\nsecurity and authenticity. Estonia's e-Health system, which\nemploys blockchain to safeguard patient health data, serves\nas an example [3]. In MedIoT contexts, blockchain has the\npotential to ensure a secure setting for data exchange and\nstorage, guaranteeing patient privacy and system\nreliability. The combination of Blockchain with AI could\nfacilitate real-time health monitoring with enhanced trust\nand reliability, leading to more effective, patient-focused\nhealthcare. This paper uniquely synthesizes the latest\nadvancements in AI and blockchain in the MedIoT\nlandscape, offering novel insights into their combined\npotential for enhancing data security, privacy, and patient\ncentered healthcare, and distinctively incorporates both\npatient and practitioner perspectives to provide a\ncomprehensive, multi-dimentional view of the field.\nSpecifically, this review makes the following\ncontributions: 1) Offers a comprehensive overview of\nexisting research in MedIoT, with a focus on AI and"}, {"title": "SCENE SETTING", "content": "Let us envision Mrs. Smith, a 65-year old retiree managing\nhypertension and Type II diabetes. Traditionally, Mrs.\nSmith's condition required frequent hospital visits and\nmanaging complex records, risking overlooked health\nfluctuations in between visits. However, in our envisaged\ndigital health future (figure 1), AI and blockchain\nenhanced MedIoT applications significantly improve her\nhealthcare management. Mrs. Smith uses a smart\nwristband, acting as her personal health guardian, tracking\nvital signs 24/7. Blockchain technology secures and\nrenders the wristband's data unalterable. Every heartbeat,\nand blood sugar level measurement is recorded on a\nblockchain system, guaranteeing data accuracy, privacy,\nand easy access. Additionally, smart contracts, a\ncharacteristic of blockchain, serve as the custodians of\nMrs. Smith's health data. These programmable contracts\nautomatically function when specific pre-set conditions are\nmet, such as data sharing with healthcare providers or alert\nactivation upon anomaly detection. Accompanying this\nblockchain system is an Al model, a virtual health\nspecialist, designed specifically for Mrs. Smith. This\nmodel processes her health data, learns her patterns, and\noffers personalized health guidance. Upon detecting an\nunusual surge in her blood sugar levels one day, the\nsystem, thanks to the smart contract within the blockchain,\nimmediately notifies Mrs. Smith and her healthcare\nprovider. After thorough data analysis, her provider adjusts\nher medication, while the Al also suggests dietary and\nlifestyle modifications based on its comprehensive\nunderstanding of Mrs. Smith's health patterns. By enabling\nproactive health management, AI and blockchain\nsupported MedIoT applications transition patients from\nbeing passive beneficiaries to active contributors in their\nhealthcare, thus improving their engagement and\nexperience. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this system\nhinges on its reliability and the user's trust. Reliability\nensures that the wristband functions correctly, providing\nprecise data, and that he AI accurately provides forecasts\nand advice. Any malfunction could lead to unnecessary\ninterventions, underlining the requirement for robust\nMedIoT devices and trustworthy AI models. Trust involves\nprivacy and data security, with potential breaches posing a\nrisk to the system's credibility. The blockchain must\nguarantee data integrity and requires user consent for data\nsharing. Finally, for Mrs. Smith to fully trust the system,\nshe needs to understand it, particularly the Al's decision-\nmaking process and blockchain's data security protocols.\nMaking these technologies user friendly and\ncomprehensible is essential."}, {"title": "MED-IOT APPLICATIONS", "content": "The combination of AI and blockchain in MedIoT has\ngained traction due to their collective potential. AI\nresearchers have been working on tailored medicine, real-\ntime health monitoring, and decision support, while\nblockchain enthusiasts focus on enhancing data security,\nprivacy, and compatibility. In the AI domain, its influence\nin healthcare is growing. Machine learning and deep\nlearning techniques accurately diagnose diseases from\nmedical imagery. For example, the COVID-CheXNet deep\nlearning algorithm can detect Covid19 from chest X-rays\nwith a 99.99% accuracy rate [4]. Moreover, Al's potential\nin disease outbreak prediction has been showcased by\nBlueDot, which predicted the Zika virus spread, later\nconfirmed by the Centres for Disease Control and\nPrevention [5]. Devices like Fitbit use Al for real-time\nhealth insights through heart rate and sleep tracking [6]. In\nthe blockchain space, we see Estonia's e-Health system\nsafeguarding health records [3], MedRec from MIT\nmanaging medical data access [7], and the Mediledger\nproject tracking prescription medicines to prevent\ncounterfeits [8]. However, the combination of AI and\nblockchain in MedIoT offers further avenues for\ninnovation with a growing number of research studies. One\nstudy highlights blockchain and Al's role in bolstering\nhealthcare data security and sharing [9]. Another project"}, {"title": "TEN CHALLENGES & FUTURE\nRESEARCH DIRECTIONS", "content": "The following identified challenges are important for\nenhancing security, ensuring privacy, and improving\npatient care efficiency. Addressing them will contribute to\nadvancing the technological capabilities of MedIoT, and\nsignificantly elevate the quality and reliability of\nhealthcare delivery.\n1) Data Security and Privacy: MedIoT encompasses a\nwide network of interconnected devices, raising\nchallenges in data security and privacy. Such devices\nare vulnerable to malicious attacks, potentially\ncompromising patient data [12]. Blockchain, with its\ndecentralized structure and cryptographic techniques,\nis seen as a robust solution for data security in this\narea. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI),\nparticularly machine learning, can detect unusual\npatterns indicating threats. Future research should\nfocus on advanced cybersecurity measures, like\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) which is resistant\nto quantum computer threats. The exploration of Post-\nQuantum Cryptography (PQC) is also important,\nensuring data protection against quantum machines.\nUsing Homomorphic Encryption in AI, which allows\noperations on encrypted data without decryption,\ncould be key for data analysis while maintaining\nprivacy. The potential of Al-driven Intrusion\nDetection Systems (IDS) should be further pursued,\nhelping in pinpointing network anomalies.\nAdditionally, technologies like Zero-knowledge\nproofs (ZKP), which verify information possession\nwithout revealing details, deserve attention, especially\nwhen integrated with blockchain, ensuring MedIoT\ndata privacy. Lastly, the potential of blockchain in\ncrafting secure, interoperable Data Marketplaces\nwarrants exploration. Such platforms can promote\ndata sharing for research, enhancing healthcare while\nensuring data confidentiality and safety.\n2) Data Integrity and Seamless Interoperability:\nEnsuring data trustworthiness and reliability is central\nto MedIoT applications. The immutable nature of\nblockchain means that once data is stored, it can't be\naltered without network consensus, preserving data's\nauthenticity and integrity. For example, patient data\nfrom a MedIoT device, once registered on the\nblockchain, remains consistent and resistant to\nunauthorized changes. This ensures that such data,\ncrucial for diagnosis or treatment, remains\ntrustworthy. A significant challenge lies in achieving\ninteroperability across various MedIoT systems and\ndevices. Devices, whether they're monitoring heart\nrates or managing insulin, should communicate and\nexchange data seamlessly. Future research should\nfocus on devising standardized blockchain protocols\nand universal Al models to ensure compatibility\nacross multiple systems. This could involve creating\nprotocols allowing different healthcare associated\nblockchain systems to collaborate easily. Al models\nshould be adaptable to interpret data from any MedIoT\ndevice, regardless of its origin or design. By\npromoting this interoperability, a secure and efficient\ndata exchange can be realized, with blockchain as the\nbackbone and AI for data analysis. Such an approach\nwould boost system trust and dependability, ensuring\nsmooth interactions across various devices and\nplatforms.\n3) Real-time Processing: In MedIoT, the need for\ninstant data processing in health monitoring\napplications is challenged by the resource demands of\nAI, especially deep learning models. For instance, a\nheart rate monitor must quickly detect anomalies. Due\nto the vast data and intricate models, real-time\nprocessing might be hindered, affecting patient health.\nA promising solution is edge computing, which\nprocesses data near its source, reducing latency and\nensuring swift reactions. Imagine a wearable device\nwith an integrated edge-based Al model, allowing\nimmediate on-device data analysis. This would enable\ninstant feedback, crucial during emergencies. Also,\ndeveloping streamlined energy saving Al models for\nedge devices could transform real-time data\nprocessing. Federated learning, which supports on\ndevice model training with local data, might speed up\nprocessing and bolster data privacy [15]. Such\ntechniques could let wearables adapt to individual\nhealth patterns directly, yielding rapid, tailored\ninsights while preserving data security. Future\nresearch should focus on a hybrid data processing\narchitecture, balancing cloud, edge, and on-device AI\nmodels. For example, routine tasks might utilize cloud"}, {"title": "", "content": "models, while urgent, critical tasks leverage edge or\non-device models. Such designs could offer reliable\nsystems ensuring prompt healthcare actions and\nefficient resource management.\n4) Scalability: MedIoT applications incorporating\nblockchain face scalability challenges due to the\nresource intensive processes like mining. Imagine a\nhospital's blockchain-based MedIoT system\nmanaging data from hundreds of devices. The sheer\nvolume can impede performance, which can be\ndisastrous when dealing, for example, with heart\nmonitor data. Addressing these issues, research could\nfocus on off-chain and hybrid solutions [14], such as\nsharding, dividing the blockchain network into\nsmaller segments, each handling its own transactions,\nthereby improving throughput. Layer 2 solutions,\nsuch as Plasma or the Lightning Network, also show\npromise. These add a layer on top of the main\nblockchain, facilitating off-chain transaction\nprocessing, similar to extra service counters speeding\nup customer service. Alternative consensus\nalgorithms, like Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated\nProof of Stake (DPoS), might offer more scalability\ncompared to the common Proof of Work (PoW). PoS\ncan be visualized as an election system prioritizing\nthose with larger stakes to validate transactions,\nenhancing speed. Similarly, the RAFT (Reliable,\nReplicated, Redundant, And Fault-Tolerant), and\nIBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithms\nare significant, with RAFT being akin to a round table\nwhere one leader is chosen to make decisions swiftly,\nwhile IBFT operates like a diplomatic consensus\nwhere multiple trusted parties agree on a transaction\nto ensure security and speed, even if some participants\nare unreliable. Technologies tailored for scalability,\nlike Polkadot's multi-chain system, are worth\nexploration. This system permits simultaneous\noperation of multiple blockchains, similarly to multi-\nlane highways boosting traffic flow. Similarly, zk-\nRollups, a Layer 2 technique, aggregates several\noperations into one, improving transaction rates.\nFuture work in these domains could ensure\nblockchain-based MedIoT systems are both\ntrustworthy and scalable, managing vast data volumes\nwhile safeguarding sensitive health data.\n5) User Acceptance and Trust: For AI and blockchain\nto thrive in MedIoT applications, user acceptance and\ntrust are crucial. Yet, their inherent complexity and\nperceived opacity can deter users. A patient might find\na blockchain health app daunting and worry about\ntheir data's privacy. Addressing these issues requires\nenhancing system transparency and user friendliness.\nFuture research could focus on creating intuitive\ninterfaces and visualizations to demystify blockchain\nfor users. Similarly, Al models should be crafted to\nyield clear and relatable results. Systems like\nDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs) might be explored,\nacting as tamper-proof digital IDs, improving trust.\nMoreover, educating users about the technology, its\nmerits, and data security measures can also build trust.\nClear explanations, like a doctor clarifying a\ndiagnosis, can enhance understanding and acceptance.\nPrioritizing such areas can boost the reliability and\ntrustworthiness of MedIoT applications, promoting\nbroader user acceptance.\n6) Explainability in AI: Al models, especially those\nusing deep learning, often function as \"black boxes\":\nthey process input data and output results without\nrevealing the details of their operations. This can\nmake it challenging for users to trust such models,\nespecially when clarity is needed, like in health\nmonitoring applications. Explainable AI (XAI) aims\nto address this by designing Al systems whose\ndecisions are both effective and transparent. Future\nresearch could explore methods like Counterfactual\nExplanations, which clarify Al decisions by showing\nhow different input would lead to varied results. It is\nlike a teacher detailing how each variable influences\nan answer. Moreover, AI development should\nconsider interdisciplinary collaboration, involving\nexperts from fields like social sciences, law, and\nethics. Such an approach can offer users a nuanced,\ncontext-specific insight into AI operations, promoting\ntrust and confidence in the technology.\n7) Ethical Considerations: Protecting the ethical use of\nsensitive health data is crucial. This involves adhering\nto data privacy regulations and ensuring patients\nunderstand how their information is used, a principle\ntermed; \"informed consent\". Future research should\nexplore how to integrate these ethical aspects directly\ninto Al and blockchain systems. A key notion is\n\"privacy by design\", implying that AI models are\nconstructed with user privacy as a core feature, not an\nafterthought. Think of it as designing a house with\nsecurity features from the outset rather than\nretrofitting them later. Highlighting ethical\nconsiderations in MedIoT not only builds trust but\nalso promotes responsible management of health data.\n8) Regulatory Compliance: A significant challenge,\nfuture research should aim to create Al models that\ninherently align with regulations, thus building user\ntrust. There is also an urgent need for unified\ninternational standards to govern AI and blockchain in\nhealthcare, addressing areas like data interoperability,\nsecurity protocols, and ethical data use. Such\nguidelines would ensure smooth data exchange\nbetween MedIoT systems and mandate strong security\nmeasures. Addressing these concerns can help"}, {"title": "", "content": "develop trustworthy MedIoT systems that are widely\naccepted and enhance healthcare results.\n9) Energy Efficiency: Given that many IoT devices are\nbattery dependent, future research should lean\ntowards devising AI models that are more energy\nconservative. In terms of deep learning models,\ntechniques such as model pruning, which streamlines\nneural networks by eliminating superfluous data, and\nquantization, which refines the numerical precision of\nparameters, offer ways to diminish computational\nneeds and, consequently, power usage. Additionally,\nconsidering alternatives to the traditionally energy-\nintensive Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism in\nblockchain, like Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated\nProof of Stake (DPoS), could further boost energy\nefficiency [15]. Such energy-efficient strategies can\nextend the lifespan of IoT device batteries, reducing\npotential system downtimes, and therefore ensuring\nmore dependable MedIoT applications. This\nguarantees consistent functionality and promotes user\ntrust by mitigating device failures. In summary,\nprioritizing energy-efficient AI and blockchain\ntechniques is essential for both environmental benefits\nand enhancing trust and reliability in MedIoT\nplatforms.\n10) Integration of AI and Blockchain: The integration\nof Al and blockchain in MedIoT offers significant\npromise. For instance, machine learning could be\nemployed to predict and refine blockchain operations,\nsuch as optimizing transaction costs by forecasting\ngas prices on platforms like Ethereum. Another\navenue could be enhancing smart contract decision-\nmaking with AI, adding an extra layer of automation\nand insight to blockchain transactions. This would\nimprove the efficiency and reliability of MedIoT\napplications. Furthermore, blockchain-based systems,\nwhen combined with AI, can be tailored for patient\nengagement and customized healthcare. Here, patient\ndata can be securely held on a blockchain, and AI can\nthen analyze this information to deliver tailored health\nrecommendations, ensuring a bespoke healthcare\njourney for each user. This dual-tech approach ensures\ndata security while offering custom insights,\nbolstering patient trust and improving health\noutcomes."}, {"title": "IN THE FIELD: PERSPECTIVES FROM\nPATIENTS AND HEALTH\nPRACTITIONERS", "content": "The integration of wearable technology into patient\nhealthcare management, although not yet a commonplace\npractice within health services, holds significant potential\n[16]. Devices like smartwatches and ambulatory blood\npressure monitors, despite their current reliance on patient\nintervention for data transmission, could facilitate a more\nproactive and personalized approach to health status\nmonitoring. Artificial intelligence (AI), while increasingly\nprevalent in many sectors, still provokes considerable\ndeliberation within healthcare. Its predictive capabilities,\nshaped by extensive training on diverse datasets, are\nundeniably powerful [17]. However, the complexities of\nmedical practice, characterized by a multitude of variables\nand often subtle nuances, highlight the irreplaceable value\nof human judgment. Thus, the consensus seems to point\ntowards Al as a supplemental tool rather than an ultimate\ndecision-making authority. Human oversight and clinical\nintuition remain essential in the diagnostic process and\ntreatment planning, underscoring the necessity for a\nhuman-in-the-loop approach when leveraging AI [18].\nEmerging technologies like blockchain present\nopportunities to overhaul the healthcare data ecosystem.\nThis technology could underpin a secure, integrated\nnetwork for sharing patient data among authorized\nhealthcare providers, although the current data landscape\nin healthcare systems often falls short of this ideal [19].\nFragmented records and limited accessibility present\nconsiderable challenges, underscoring the need for a\nsystem where all relevant healthcare professionals can\naccess accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date patient\nhealth records. Security and privacy are cornerstone\nconcerns when considering the integration of such\ntechnologies. Rigorous measures are needed to ensure data\nsecurity and patient privacy, stipulating that only\nauthorized individuals can access sensitive health\ninformation and patients maintain control over their health\ndata. The introduction of these technologies also\nnecessitates comprehensive training and awareness among\nhealthcare practitioners. Given the likelihood of resistance,\nparticularly among those less comfortable with\ntechnology, implementation strategies should be\nconsidered carefully [20]. This might include running\nparallel systems during transition periods to prevent\ndisruption and foster gradual adaptation. Lastly, it is\ncrucial to resolve health disparities when implementing\nthese technologies. Consideration must be given to factors\nsuch as language barriers, cultural differences, and extant\ndisparities in health outcomes between demographic\ngroups. The aspiration should be to leverage these\ntechnologies to mitigate health inequalities rather than\ninadvertently exacerbating them. In conclusion, the\nintegration of technologies such as AI and blockchain into\nhealthcare holds significant potential but also presents\nsubstantial challenges. Careful, thoughtful, and inclusive\nimplementation strategies are essential for their successful\nintegration into patient care. Future research should focus\non developing protocols for secure and ethical data\nmanagement, exploring the balance between human\njudgment and AI in medical decision-making, and\nassessing the potential of these technologies to address"}]}

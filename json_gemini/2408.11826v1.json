Through our simulation, we obtained several\ninteresting findings. At the organizational level, an increase in the average values\nof management competence and functional competence can reduce overall mem-\nbers' stress levels, but it negatively impacts deeper organizational performance\nmeasures such as average task completion. At the individual level, both com-\npetences can improve members' work performance. From the analysis of social\nnetworks, we found that highly competent members selectively participate in cer-\ntain tasks and take on more responsibilities. Over time, small sub-communities\nform around these highly competent members within the holacracy. These find-\nings contribute theoretically to the study of organizational science and provide\npractical insights for managers to understand the organization dynamics.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Holacracy is an innovative management model proposed by Brian Robertson, the\nfounder of the software company. It is a democratic and open organizational structure\nwith shared governance for all, aiming at the decentralized management of an organi-\nzation by breaking the authoritarianism of the leadership through the assumption of\nwork by roles[1]. Such a management model is better to give employees the freedom\nto be more creative; however, at the same time, it also creates conflicts between roles\nand teams, resulting in many organizational practices ending in failure [2]. Although\nsome static influence mechanisms have been explored in the past [3, 4], the dynamic\noperation of the system, like autority delegation, is not well understood. In this paper,\nbased on the simulation capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) [5, 6], we built\nCareerAgent, an organizational behavior simulation framework based on LLM Agents,\nas shown in Figure 1, to simulate the operation of organizations under the holacracy\nframework, and found some interesting phenomena.\nOne of the characteristics of the holacracy is that the leaders delegate their author-\nity to the employees at the lower level. This act of authorization puts the work or\nproject in the hands of the employees and gives them full autonomy in decision-making,\nwhich leads to pressure increase for the employees [7]. Work stress is characterized by\ntwo components, psychological workload and decision-making volume, and the inter-\naction of workload and decision-making volume produces psychological stress [8, 9].\nUnder such a characterization, employees' managerial decision-making competence\nand professional competence to deal with work will have an impact on their percep-\ntion of stress. At the same time, different employee competence characteristics will\nalso affect the experience of cooperation between individuals, which in turn will affect\nthe division of the circle [10].\nTherefore, we conducted a simulation experiment based on the LLM-based Agent\napproach for eight weeks, with weekly rounds of task issuance and billing, and four\ntasks per round. The study worked through eight weeks of simulations and found\nresults at both the organizational and individual levels. At the organizational level,\naverage competence has a positive effect on work completion and a negative effect on\nstress. At the circle level, the higher the average competence, the lower the average\nnumber of circles per employee and the lower the average number of people in each\ncircle. The higher the average competence, the smaller the average degree of employee\ncommunication network formation in the organization. At the individual level com-\npetence has a positive effect on work completion and a negative effect on stress. The\nhigher the competence the smaller the number of circles in which they are located and\nthe greater the average workload."}, {"title": "2 The process and key concepts of holacracy", "content": "The holacracy is a management framework with a set of well-defined rules that detail\nthe \"rules of engagement\" for each job in the organization, including the organizational\nstructure, decision-making, and the way power is distributed.

First, we constructed the\norganization's social network. We added an edge between members who participated\nin the same tasks over the eight weeks. To represent the strength of these connections\nin more detail, we used workload as the edge weight, indicating that fewer partici-\npants in a task can result in stronger connections between members. Ultimately, we\nobtained the organizational social network graph, as shown in Figure 3. In the graph,\nwe performed modularity-based clustering, with different colors representing different\nclusters, and the size of the nodes indicating their PageRank values. We can observe\nthat over time, members form distinct sub-communities within the organization, with\neach sub-community having core members.\nFurthermore, to examine whether members with higher status in the social net-\nwork are related to their competences, we constructed an econometric model based\non the individual-level analysis mentioned above (Equation 15). The specific results\nare presented in Table 4 and Table 5. According to the results, we found that\nboth competences positively impact all social network indicators, including close-\nness centrality (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.004, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.012, p < 0.01), betweenness centrality\n(\u03b2\u2081 = 0.005, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.019, p < 0.01), eigenvector centrality (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.013, p <\n0.01; \u03b22 = 0.039, p < 0.01), clustering coefficient (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.014, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.044, p <\n0.01), authority score (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.009, p < 0.01), hub score\n(\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.009, p < 0.01) and PageRank value (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p <\n0.01; \u03b22 = 0.008, p < 0.01). Additionally, the positive impact of the competence mean\non these indicators further proves the robustness of our results. These findings indicate\nthat individuals with stronger competence occupy more central positions in the social\nnetwork. Furthermore, this result suggests that although the holacracy does not set\nfixed roles or include fixed task allocations, over time, more competent members tend\nto emerge and occupy important positions within the organization. This conclusion\nhas significant implications for organizational structure design in management prac-\ntice. At the same time, differences in competences also have a significant impact on\ncertain social network indicators. Competence differences have a significant positive\neffect on closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and pagerank value.

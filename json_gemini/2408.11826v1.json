Specifically, the simulation framework includes three phases: construction, execution, and evaluation, and it incorporates basic characteristics of individuals, organizations, tasks, and meetings. Through our simulation, we obtained several interesting findings. At the organizational level, an increase in the average values of management competence and functional competence can reduce overall members' stress levels, but it negatively impacts deeper organizational performance measures such as average task completion. At the individual level, both competences can improve members' work performance. From the analysis of social networks, we found that highly competent members selectively participate in cer- tain tasks and take on more responsibilities. Over time, small sub-communities form around these highly competent members within the holacracy. These find- ings contribute theoretically to the study of organizational science and provide practical insights for managers to understand the organization dynamics.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Holacracy is an innovative management model proposed by Brian Robertson, the founder of the software company. It is a democratic and open organizational structure with shared governance for all, aiming at the decentralized management of an organi- zation by breaking the authoritarianism of the leadership through the assumption of work by roles[1]. Such a management model is better to give employees the freedom to be more creative; however, at the same time, it also creates conflicts between roles and teams, resulting in many organizational practices ending in failure [2]. Although some static influence mechanisms have been explored in the past [3, 4], the dynamic operation of the system, like autority delegation, is not well understood. In this paper, based on the simulation capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) [5, 6], we built CareerAgent, an organizational behavior simulation framework based on LLM Agents, as shown in Figure 1, to simulate the operation of organizations under the holacracy framework, and found some interesting phenomena.\nOne of the characteristics of the holacracy is that the leaders delegate their author- ity to the employees at the lower level. This act of authorization puts the work or project in the hands of the employees and gives them full autonomy in decision-making, which leads to pressure increase for the employees [7]. Work stress is characterized by two components, psychological workload and decision-making volume, and the inter- action of workload and decision-making volume produces psychological stress [8, 9]. Under such a characterization, employees' managerial decision-making competence and professional competence to deal with work will have an impact on their percep- tion of stress. At the same time, different employee competence characteristics will also affect the experience of cooperation between individuals, which in turn will affect the division of the circle [10].\nTherefore, we conducted a simulation experiment based on the LLM-based Agent approach for eight weeks, with weekly rounds of task issuance and billing, and four tasks per round. The study worked through eight weeks of simulations and found results at both the organizational and individual levels. At the organizational level, average competence has a positive effect on work completion and a negative effect on stress. At the circle level, the higher the average competence, the lower the average number of circles per employee and the lower the average number of people in each circle. The higher the average competence, the smaller the average degree of employee communication network formation in the organization. At the individual level com- petence has a positive effect on work completion and a negative effect on stress. The higher the competence the smaller the number of circles in which they are located and the greater the average workload."}, {"title": "2 The process and key concepts of holacracy", "content": "The holacracy is a management framework with a set of well-defined rules that detail the \"rules of engagement\" for each job in the organization, including the organizational structure, decision-making, and the way power is distributed. One of the main features of the holacracy is \"democracy\", which means that the leader needs to decentralize his/her authority, eliminating the traditional CEO, and decentralizing management responsibilities to different roles to achieve \"autonomy\" for employees. Specifically, the \"constitution\" of a holacracy can be divided into five parts: organizational struc- ture, rules of cooperation, tactical meetings, distribution of authority, and governance processes.\n(1) Organizational structure\nA \"Role\" is an organizational construct that a person can fill and then energize on behalf of the Organization. Whoever fills a Role is a \u201cRole Lead\" for that Role. A \"Role\" is responsible for regularly considering how to enact your Role's Purpose and each Accountability, by defining: \u201cNext-Actions\", which are useful actions that you could take immediately, at least in the absence of competing priorities; \"Projects\", which are specific outcomes that would be useful to work towards, at least in the absence of competing priorities.\nA \"Circle\" is a container for organizing Roles and Policies around a common Purpose. The Roles and Policies within a Circle make up its acting \"Governance\". The inside of every Role is a Circle. This Circle can hold its own Roles and Policies to break down and organize its work. This does not apply to the Roles defined in this Constitution, which may not be further broken down. A Role's internal Circle is considered a \"Sub-Circle\" of the broader Circle that holds the Role, while that broader Circle is its \"Super-Circle\".\nAny Circle may appoint someone as the Circle's \"Facilitator\". The selected Facil- itator fills a \"Facilitator Role\" in the Circle, with a Purpose of \"Circle governance and operational practices aligned with the Constitution\".\nAny Circle may appoint someone as the Circle's \"Secretary\". The selected Sec- retary fills a \"Secretary Role\" in the Circle, with a Purpose of \"Stabilize the Circle's constitutionally-required records and meetings\". A Circle may add Accountabilities or Domains to its own Facilitator or Secretary Role, as well as amend or remove those additions. No Circle may amend or remove the Purpose of either Role, nor any Accountabilities or Domains placed on those Roles by this Constitution.\n(2) Rules of cooperation\nThe rules of cooperation in the holacracy define the basic duties that all part- ners expect from each other. It includes duty of transparency (e.g., upon request, all roles must share what they are working on); duty of processing (e.g., each role must respond to a request to accept new work and accept it unless they decide not to, in which case they must explain why), duty of prioritization (e.g., must be aligned with the circle's strategy, prioritize securing internal communications, etc.), and relational agreements, which are agreements about how you will relate together while working in the organization, or about how you will fulfill the general functions as Partners of the Organization.\n(3) Tactical meetings\nAny Partner may convene a \"Tactical Meeting\" to assist Partners in engaging each other in their responsibilities and duties. In addition, the Secretary of each Circle is accountable for scheduling regular Tactical Meetings for the Circle. The Facilitator of a Circle is accountable for facilitating the Circle's regular Tactical Meetings, and its Secretary is accountable for capturing and publishing Tactical Meeting outputs. For Tactical Meetings convened by someone other than a Circle's Secretary, the Partner convening a Tactical Meeting must facilitate it and capture its outputs, or appoint another volunteer or appropriate Role to do so.\n(4) Distributed authority\nAs a Role Lead, you have the authority to take any action or make any decision to enact your Role's Purpose or Accountabilities, as long as you don't break a rule defined in this Constitution. When prioritizing and choosing among your potential actions, you may use your own reasonable judgment of the relative value to the Organization of each.\n(5) Governance process\nChanging a Circle's Governance requires using the \u201cGovernance Process\" defined herein. The holacracy governance process provides for decentralized gover- nance processes within each team. Anyone can suggest improvements to the structure of the organization within their scope of work, and it allows anyone in the organization (not just \"leaders\") to suggest improvements to the organizational structure of roles and circles. Such a rule fundamentally shifts the center of power to the governance process, making the organization truly \"self-governing\" and \"purpose-driven\".\""}, {"title": "3 LLM-based simulation platform for holacracy", "content": "In this section, we introduce our LLM-based simulation framework for holacracy. A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning-based natural language processing model capable of producing high-quality text. LLM uses a large amount of train- ing data to learn and has the ability to understand and generate language. Its text generation capability can be simplified as the following equation:\n$\nText_{output} = LLM(Text_{input})\n$\nwhere, $Text_{output}$ is the generated text, $(Text_{input})$ is the input text.\nLLM has strong simulation ability of role. In practical application, it can simulate various roles and generate corresponding dialogues and behaviors according to the set tasks and scenes. Using the simulation power of the LLM, we divide the holacracy simulation into three phases: (1) Construction phase: Employees form specific work- ing relationships/connections according to the rules of the organization, which is the beginning part of the pipeline and is performed once in a cycle (initialization); (2) Execution phase: Employees perform corresponding jobs/tasks according to specific working relationships, which is the main part of the whole pipeline and will be executed many times in a cycle; (3) Evaluation phase: Evaluation and feedback of current mem- bers and their relationships based on their work completion, which further influences the next cycle. The specific framework is displayed in Figure 2, which has a context background, including members' characteristics, world environment, and members' initial relationships. Next, we will introduce the specific information about different phases."}, {"title": "3.1 Construction phase", "content": "The construction phase is mainly to enter the context of the organization, mem- bers, and world for the framework, while carrying out the initial task generation and assignment.\nWorld environment setting includes the target, industry, tasks of the organi- zation, this parameters could be represented by a set E.\nMembers generation is set according to the world environment. There are N members, each of which includes position, skills, competences, experiences and so on, these characteristics could be represented by $e_i$:\n$\ne_i [e_{i1}, e_{i2},..., e_{im}]$\n$\nwhere, $e_{ij}$ is the $j^{th}$ characteristic of the member $i$, there are m of the member $i$. The member generation process could be formulated as follows:\n$\n{e_i}^N_{i=1} = LLM(E, Generate N persons)\n$\nwhere LLM is the generation function based on LLM.\nTask generation is generated according to the world environment and the number of members N, the number of task is M and the workload of each task is WT.

For example, if member i wants to chat with member j and member i wants to chat with member j, the the framework will combine the plans of i and j into one plan $P_{ij}$. $P_{ij}$ includes all plans of the member i and member j.

At the same time, the attempt in practice will spend a lot of manpower and material resources, there is a long test cycle, high cost and many other inconveniences. Traditional approaches to theory development are limited in their ability to analyze multiple interdependent processes operating simultaneously[11]. As technology develops, LLM becomes more and more mature, and the research on AI for simulating the real world continues to progress, making it possible to use Agents to simulate organizational practices[12]. Therefore, we try to explore the effect of employee competence on work pressure, completion and circle division in the organization under the management mode of holacracy by using a large model-based Agent simulation method. Due to the non-role differences in individual attributes, the individual employee attributes in the experiment are divided by individuals rather than roles, but different roles involve different work and decision- making practices."}, {"title": "4.2.1 Individual", "content": "The individual segment contains three aspects of the individual's inherent attributes, variable states, and behaviors, and is represented in the data information by two parts: personal information and personal records.\nInherent attributes: Personality descriptions describing character as well as life habits, such as mild, lively, calm, lazy, etc., and life habits expressed as whether or not they take lunch breaks/like to exercise, etc., affect individual performance. Personal skills includes personal research direction description, management competence and functional competence. Personal skills will affect the individual's state and decision-making. Among them, management competence refers to the ability of individual management, including self-management, decision-making ability; functional ability refers to the degree of individual competence in the current position, including job- specific specialized theoretical needs of knowledge reserves.\nVariable state: Work pressure, mainly reflects the individual's demand for work and decision-making, i.e., an increase in the amount of work and decision-making will increase the value of individual's pressure. At the same time, different individuals have different sensitivities to stress according to their competence, i.e., the value of pressure increases differently when facing the same amount of work or decision-making. Work completion, i.e. the difference between actual work results and expectations. The level of work completion affects the willingness of individuals to cooperate with each other, which in turn affects subsequent circle divisions.\nIndividual actions: Governance meeting is to identify the various roles cur- rently undertaken by individuals and the circle situations in which they are located; Tactical meeting is to solve problems encountered in the work; Work behaviors include behaviors such as making daily plans, reflecting and remembering, and simulating real-world work by accumulating work hours."}, {"title": "4.2.2 Organization", "content": "The organization board contains aspects such as base settings, project lists, and circle divisions.\nBase settings: Organizational background setting is used to record the basic information of the organization. The management mode is holacracy, which is mainly reflected in the freedom of task distribution, high transparency of information, and the role/circle structure. The organizational goal is the goal of the fundamental circle, which is the behavioral quasi-measurement all the staffs have to comply with as a priority, and the goal of the current stage is to complete the list of all the projects.\nProject lists: The project list contains information such as work hours required for completion, deadline dates, and task profiles.

On the one hand, we use the econometric model to evaluate the theoretical mechanism of the Holacracy. On the other hand, we analyzed the social network dynamics during the simulation."}, {"title": "5.1 Empirical analyses", "content": "Firstly, we specified the following econometric model (Equation 14) to estimate the influence of degree of two different competences in organization on the work completion level, average stress degree and average circle number:\n$\n\u03a5\u2081 = \u03b2\u03bf + \u03b2\u2081 Management\\_competence; + \u03b22Functional\\_competence; + \u03b5\n$\nwhere Yi is the situation level for organization i, including three dependent variables, which are work completion level, average stress degree and average circle number at the end of the eighth week. Since these three variables are the continuous vari- ables, we used ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to estimate Yi, which were measured using ordinal scales. At the same time, Management_competence and Functional_competence represent the competence level for organization i, including two variables correspondingly, which are the average value and variations value mea- sured by standard deviation at the end of the eighth week. B\u2081 and B2 are thus the coefficients of interest at the organizational level.\nThe results of organizational level are shown in Table 1. According to the results, two kinds of competence mean all have a negative effect on the average stress degree (Management_competence: \u03b2\u2081 = -8.417, p < 0.01; Functional_competence : \u1e9e2 = -8.099, p < 0.01), i.e., the higher the average competence of the organization, the lower the stress felt by the members of the organization. Besides, two kinds of compe- tence mean all have a negative effect on work completion in the organization as a whole (Management_competence : \u03b2\u2081 = -0.080, p < 0.05; Functional_competence : \u1e9e2 = -0.084, p < 0.05), i.e., when the average competence of the organization is stronger, however, the task completion in the organization is worse. This result suggests that a relatively high mean competence of members in an organization does not necessar- ily lead to efficient work completion, but will cause competition or task allocation problems in some organizations, resulting in a decline in the level of work comple- tion. In terms of circle segmentation and competence variations, there is no significant effect among these relationships. Overall, the average competence of the members in the organization does not necessarily completely determine the organizational perfor- mance, but more can determine the direct performance, i.e. members' stress, and the organization's competence, i.e., the work completion, may also require other factors [14, 15].\nSecondly, we specified the following econometric model (Equation 15) to estimate the influence of degree of two different competences of the members on the corre- sponding work completion level, average stress degree and average circle number. Furthermore, at the individual level, in particular, we added the average workload to measure the performance of different members:\n$\n\u03a5\u2081 = \u03b2\u03bf + \u03b2\u2081 Management\\_competencei + B2Functional\\_competencei + E\n$\nwhere $Y_i$ is the situation level for member $i$, including four dependent variables, which are stress degree, work completion level, average circle number and average workload at the end of the eight week. Also, these variables are the continuous vari- ables, we used ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to estimate $Y_i$, which were measured using ordinal scales. At the same time, Management_competence and Functional_competence represent the competence level for organization $i$, as for indi- vidual, which are only the mean values. B\u2081 and B2 are thus the coefficients of interest at the organizational level.\nThe main results of individual level are shown in Table 2. Accordingly, two kinds of competence all have a negative effect on the stress degree (Management_competence : \u03b2\u2081 = -9.259, p < 0.01; Functional_competence : B2 = -6.479, p < 0.01). Besides, two kinds of competence all have a positive effect on individual work comple- tion (Management_competence: \u03b2\u2081 = 0.185, p < 0.01; Functional_competence : \u03b22 = 0.550, p < 0.01). Interestingly, we could find some results different with the organizational level. Both competencies positively influence the average circle num- ber (Management_competence: \u03b2\u2081 = 0.177, p < 0.01; Functional_competence : \u03b22 = 0.558, p < 0.01) and also have a positive impact on average workload (Management_competence:\u03b2\u2081 = 0.016, p < 0.01; Functional_competence : B2 = 0.048, p < 0.01), suggesting that individuals with stronger competencies take on more tasks while fewer people complete each task simultaneously. Furthermore, the results show that high-level members tend to selectively build appropriate circle sizes rather than blindly act collectively. Overall, within the holacracy, it is evident that compe- tence motivates individuals to voluntarily assume more responsibilities. Additionally, individual results can partially elucidate the results at organizational level. When the individual competence of the organization is high, that is, the organization has a high average competence, too many tasks for each member will lead to an increase in coor- dination cost and an insurmountable management competence, which will lead to a decline in the level of work completion level. Furthermore, in order to better observe the interaction between the two competences, we observed the impact of the mean value and difference of competences on different outcome variables, and the specific results are shown in Table 3. According to the results, we can see that the influence effect of the mean is same as the main results, however, the difference has no significant impact."}, {"title": "5.2 Social network analysis", "content": "To obtain detailed information about members' social behavior, we conducted a fur- ther analysis of social relationships within the organization. First, we constructed the organization's social network. We added an edge between members who participated in the same tasks over the eight weeks. To represent the strength of these connections in more detail, we used workload as the edge weight, indicating that fewer partici- pants in a task can result in stronger connections between members. Ultimately, we obtained the organizational social network graph, as shown in Figure 3. In the graph, we performed modularity-based clustering, with different colors representing different clusters, and the size of the nodes indicating their PageRank values. We can observe that over time, members form distinct sub-communities within the organization, with each sub-community having core members.\nFurthermore, to examine whether members with higher status in the social net- work are related to their competences, we constructed an econometric model based on the individual-level analysis mentioned above (Equation 15). The specific results are presented in Table 4 and Table 5. According to the results, we found that both competences positively impact all social network indicators, including close- ness centrality (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.004, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.012, p < 0.01), betweenness centrality (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.005, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.019, p < 0.01), eigenvector centrality (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.013, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.039, p < 0.01), clustering coefficient (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.014, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.044, p < 0.01), authority score (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.009, p < 0.01), hub score (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.009, p < 0.01) and PageRank value (\u03b2\u2081 = 0.003, p < 0.01; \u03b22 = 0.008, p < 0.01). Additionally, the positive impact of the competence mean on these indicators further proves the robustness of our results. These findings indicate that individuals with stronger competence occupy more central positions in the social network. Furthermore, this result suggests that although the holacracy does not set fixed roles or include fixed task allocations, over time, more competent members tend to emerge and occupy important positions within the organization. This conclusion has significant implications for organizational structure design in management prac- tice. At the same time, differences in competences also have a significant impact on certain social network indicators. Competence differences have a significant positive effect on closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and pagerank value. This indi- cates that having a higher competence in a particular aspect can also lead to members occupying central positions in the social network."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "This paper develops an LLM-based simulation framework to address structural issues in organizational science research that are difficult to explore experimentally. The framework leverages the powerful cognitive and behavioral capabilities of LLMs. The analysis of the experimental results leads to three main conclusions: First, at the orga- nizational level, an increase in average competence reduces average stress level but has limited impact on enhancing the competence coded in the organization. Specifi- cally, the average task completion level within the organization decreases. Second, at the individual level, an increase in competence also reduces individual stress. Unlike organizations, individuals' task completion levels improve with higher competence. Further analysis of social structures reveals that individuals with higher competence tend to be self-driven and more goal-oriented in their task selection. Third, in terms of social networks, individuals with higher competence occupy more central posi- tions. Higher competence in a specific area also leads to similar effects. Theoretically, these conclusions contribute to research on organizational structures in organizational science, particularly studies on decentralized organizations. Our framework provides"}]}

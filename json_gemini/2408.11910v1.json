{"title": "Why am I Still Seeing This: Measuring the Effectiveness Of Ad Controls and\nExplanations in AI-Mediated Ad Targeting Systems", "authors": ["Jane Castleman", "Aleksandra Korolova"], "abstract": "Recently, Meta has shifted towards AI-mediated ad targeting\nmechanisms that do not require advertisers to provide detailed\ntargeting criteria. The shift is likely driven by excitement over\nAl capabilities as well as the need to address new data privacy\npolicies and targeting changes agreed upon in civil rights set-\ntlements. At the same time, in response to growing public\nconcern about the harms of targeted advertising, Meta has\ntouted their ad preference controls as an effective mechanism\nfor users to exert control over the advertising they see. Fur-\nthermore, Meta markets their \"Why this ad\" targeting expla-\nnation as a transparency tool that allows users to understand\nthe reasons for seeing particular ads and inform their actions\nto control what ads they see in the future.\nOur study evaluates the effectiveness of Meta's \"See less\" ad\ncontrol, as well as the actionability of ad targeting explana-\ntions following the shift to AI-mediated targeting. We con-\nduct a large-scale study, randomly assigning participants the\nintervention of marking \"See less\" to either Body Weight Con-\ntrol or Parenting topics, and collecting the ads Meta shows to\nparticipants and their targeting explanations before and after\nthe intervention. We find that utilizing the \"See less\" ad con-\ntrol for the topics we study does not significantly reduce the\nnumber of ads shown by Meta on these topics, and that the\ncontrol is less effective for some users whose demographics\nare correlated with the topic. Furthermore, we find that the\nmajority of ad targeting explanations for local ads made no\nreference to location-specific targeting criteria, and did not\ninform users why ads related to the topics they requested to\n\"See less\" of continued to be delivered. We hypothesize that\nthe poor effectiveness of controls and lack of actionability\nand comprehensiveness in explanations are the result of the\nshift to AI-mediated targeting, for which explainability and\ntransparency tools have not yet been developed by Meta. Our\nwork thus provides evidence for the need of new methods for\ntransparency and user control, suitable and reflective of how\nthe increasingly complex and AI-mediated ad delivery sys-\ntems operate.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the first quarter of 2024, Meta brought in $35.6 billion\nin ad revenue (Meta 2024b), with their targeted advertis-\ning and matching systems helping advertisers reach new and\nexisting audiences for whom the ads are particularly rele-\nvant (Meta 2022a). However, extensive prior work now de-\ntails the harms that such targeted ads, pushed to users' feeds\nbased on information collected about them without their ex-\nplicit control, can have on users. For example, ads on sub-\njects such as body weight control and image can increase\nanxiety and threaten users' health (Gak, Olojo, and Salehi\n2022). Queer users have pointed out the dangers of targeted\nadvertising in violating their privacy and control over their\nidentity, and expressed the need for better explanations and\ncontrols to mediate the information and assumptions used to\ntarget their ads (Sampson, Encarnacion, and Metaxa 2023).\nUsers with particular health conditions note the helplessness\nand trauma they feel when ads related to their health are\nforced onto their feed, with no way to completely stop these\nads or prevent targeting based on inferred traits (Wu et al.\n2023).\nIn response to these harms, Facebook (currently Meta)\nbuilt a suite of user-facing tools such as ad preferences and\nindividual ad targeting explanations, aimed to give users\ncontrol and agency over the ads they see. A key ad person-\nalization control tool is a button that allows users to mark\n\"See less\" to specific ad topics in Ad Preferences. Facebook\npromises that after marking \"See less\" for a topic, advertis-\ners won't be able to target the user by specifying an interest\nin that topic for all future ads (shown in Figure 2) (Facebook\nHelp Center 2024). A key transparency control tool is the\n\"Why am I seeing this ad?\" interface (shown in Figure 1) at\nthe top of each ad (Meta 2019), which Facebook promises\ndetails the advertiser choices and user activity that informed\nthat ad's delivery. Furthermore, the explanations are aimed\nto help users inform their ad control choices, as they provide\na key entry point to the ad preferences.\nPrevious work has already found these controls to have\nlimited accessibility (Hsu et al. 2020) and the ad explana-\ntions to not be fully transparent (Andreou et al. 2018). Our\nmain focus is understanding whether the effectiveness of\nthese controls and explanations are further hampered by\nthe recent shift to AI-mediated targeting on Meta.\nThe shift to AI-mediated targeting has been a result of\nthe introduction of new privacy protections and restrictions\non targeting due to regulatory, competition, civil rights and\npolitical considerations. In particular, new data privacy poli-\ncies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency, have pres-"}, {"title": "for specific topics. The result is lack of effectiveness of ad\ncontrols and explanations.\nOur work and contributions", "content": "We perform a large-scale\nsociotechnical audit to measure how Facebook's ad match-\ning algorithm responds to user-initiated changes in ad con-\ntrols on the topics of Body Weight Control and Parenting in\nearly 2024. We recruit a generic group of users and a group\nof users whose age and gender are correlated with interest in\neach topic to understand whether it is more difficult for users\nbelonging to certain demographic groups to effectively opt-\nout of certain ad topics. We randomly assign our recruited\nparticipants to mark \"See less\" to the ad topics and measure\nwhether there is an observable change in the number of ads\nthose users subsequently receive about those topics. Finally,\nto provide insight into the impact of Advantage+ audiences\non ad explanations, we collect the targeting explanations at-\ntached to each ad and quantify the misalignment between\nthe ad content and explanations.\nOur findings provide new quantitative evidence of the in-\neffectiveness of marking \"See less\" to the topics of Body\nWeight Control and Parenting. They also show that ad tar-\ngeting explanations do not productively inform ad control\nchanges, including for ads relating to topics that users have\nmarked to \"See less\" of. We summarize our findings as fol-\nlows:\n\u2022 We find large-scale, quantitative evidence of the ineffec-\ntiveness of Facebook's \"See less\" ad control that was\nbuilt around categorical targeting of demographics, in-\nterests, and behaviors.\n\u2022 We compare the effectiveness of \u201cSee less\u201d ad controls\nacross demographics, and find the controls are less effec-\ntive for some users belonging to demographic groups that\nare more likely to have actual experiences with the topic\nthey are trying to \"See less\" of.\n\u2022 In our analysis of ad targeting explanations we find that\nthe majority fail to be informative and do not connect to\nexisting ad controls. In particular, the misalignment of\ngeneric geographic targeting explanations with evidently\nlocal ad content offers insight into the effects of Advan-\ntage+ audience targeting on actionability of ad explana-\ntions.\nThese results validate our hypothesis that AI-mediated\ntargeting mechanisms negatively impact the effectiveness of\nad controls and the actionability of ad delivery decisions,\nleading to a substantial decrease in meaningful transparency\nand control over advertising personalization for the users.\nOur work thus motivates new research questions in explain-\nability of AI, particularly in reconciling AI-mediated target-\ning and matching with the need for faithful, actionable ex-\nplanations and controls."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Existing research outlines the importance of user control,\ntransparency, and algorithmic audits in supporting users and\nholding platforms accountable for their targeted advertising\nsystems."}, {"title": "User Control", "content": "Providing users with control over the ads\nthey see is crucial for maintaining their agency and safety.\nAd delivery algorithms continue to show clickbait, untrust-\nworthy, and distasteful ads despite including ad quality in\ntheir ad ranking process (Zeng, Kohno, and Roesner 2021).\nAds can also cause psychological distress, loss of autonomy,\nchanges to user behavior, and marginalization or traumatiza-\ntion (Wu et al. 2023).\nOur study of Facebook's ad controls focuses on ad topic\ncontrols, inferred from users' activities and used in ad ex-\nplanations. For users with histories of disordered eating, tar-\ngeted advertising worsened anxiety surrounding food and\nexercise and negatively impacted self-esteem (Gak, Olojo,\nand Salehi 2022). For years, women have noted their in-\nability to see fewer ads related to pregnancy and children's\nhealth, increasing anxiety and forcing them to revisit trauma\n(Brockell 2018; Contreras 2022). While users cannot fully\nremove assigned ad topics, they can mark \"See less\" to ads\nrelating to these topics. Given users' expressed desires to\nexert control over ads relating to Body Weight Control and\nParenting, we focus on these topics in our study of effective-\nness of Facebook's \"See less\" ad control.\nDespite Facebook's communications regarding the power\nand value of its ad personalization and transparency con-\ntrol tools (Meta 2019; Facebook Help Center 2024), re-\nsearch continues to find that current systems have ineffective\nalgorithmic controls, opaque and misleading explanations,\nand poorly designed interfaces, all reducing user agency\n(Chromik et al. 2019). Other studies have emphasized the\nlack of usability of existing ad interfaces, (Habib et al. 2020,\n2022; Leon et al. 2012), arguing that controls are not suffi-\nciently accessible nor are they aligned with user needs."}, {"title": "Algorithmic Transparency", "content": "Given the complexity of AI-\nmediated ad targeting systems, algorithmic transparency is\ncrucial for users' understanding of how their data is used to\nmake ad delivery decisions and inform ad control changes.\nWhen users do not fully understand AI systems, they build\ntheir own inferences about how the algorithm functions\n(Yuan et al. 2023) and expect improvement (Smith-Renner\net al. 2020), which can lead to misinformed attempts at con-\ntrol and frustration. Users also note the importance of accu-\nrate ad explanations for ads leveraging personal data, inter-\nest targeting, and custom audiences to maintain a sense of\ncontrol over their data (Lee et al. 2023; Wei et al. 2020), and\ntheir desire to understand how algorithms use their infor-\nmation to make inferences (Dolin et al. 2018; Eslami et al.\n2018). Transparent explanations and opportunities for feed-\nback through ad controls help inform productive choices\nover AI-mediated decisions and user data (Smith-Renner\net al. 2020).\nRecent research by (Chouaki et al. 2022) suggests that\nchanges to Facebook's ad platform have driven a shift away\nfrom advertiser-driven microtargeting, finding that the ma-\njority of ads did not use microtargeting in comparison to a\n2018 study (Caba\u00f1as, Cuevas, and Cuevas 2018). We hy-\npothesize that shift towards generic, AI-mediated targeting\nthreatens transparency, since ad delivery algorithms can no\nlonger rely on advertiser targeting criteria to explain ad de-\nlivery, creating new transparency challenges.\nAdditionally, many problematic ads use no targeting, in-\ndicating that the ad delivery algorithm perceives them as\nrelevant to users rather than delivering them based on au-\ndience targeting (Ali et al. 2023). When ad explanations are\nincomplete or incorrect, users may still attempt to infer ex-\nplanations and are hesitant to blame algorithmic error, mis-\ninforming future actions to control their ads (Eslami et al.\n2018; Rader and Gray 2015). Complete, accurate, and ac-\ntionable ad explanations are thus necessary for expressing\nwhat data was used to inform ad delivery and provide users\nwith information to make productive ad control changes."}, {"title": "Algorithmic Audits", "content": "Algorithmic audits are essential tools\nfor investigating the mechanisms of black-box ad delivery\nsystems to uncover their impacts on privacy, fairness, po-\nlarization, and user experiences. Previous investigations into\nFacebook's ad targeting revealed that it led to privacy threats\nto users' personal information (Faizullabhoy and Korolova\n2018; Korolova 2011); the Meta Pixel sent sensitive medical\ninformation to advertisers (Feathers et al. 2022), and that\nadversaries could uncover users' phone numbers and site\nvisits by reconstructing custom audience data (Venkatadri\net al. 2018). Audits also revealed discriminatory ad deliv-\nery, with algorithms inequitably delivering harmful ads (Ali\net al. 2022), housing and employment ads (Ali et al. 2019;\nNagaraj Rao and Korolova 2023; Imana, Korolova, and Hei-\ndemann 2021), and education ads (Imana, Korolova, and\nHeidemann 2024), and contributing to echo chambers in po-\nlitical advertising (Ali et al. 2021).

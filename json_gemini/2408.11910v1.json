{"title": "Why am I Still Seeing This: Measuring the Effectiveness Of Ad Controls and Explanations in AI-Mediated Ad Targeting Systems", "authors": ["Jane Castleman", "Aleksandra Korolova"], "abstract": "Recently, Meta has shifted towards AI-mediated ad targeting mechanisms that do not require advertisers to provide detailed targeting criteria. The shift is likely driven by excitement over Al capabilities as well as the need to address new data privacy policies and targeting changes agreed upon in civil rights settlements. At the same time, in response to growing public concern about the harms of targeted advertising, Meta has touted their ad preference controls as an effective mechanism for users to exert control over the advertising they see. Furthermore, Meta markets their \"Why this ad\" targeting explanation as a transparency tool that allows users to understand the reasons for seeing particular ads and inform their actions to control what ads they see in the future.\nOur study evaluates the effectiveness of Meta's \"See less\" ad control, as well as the actionability of ad targeting explanations following the shift to AI-mediated targeting. We conduct a large-scale study, randomly assigning participants the intervention of marking \"See less\" to either Body Weight Control or Parenting topics, and collecting the ads Meta shows to participants and their targeting explanations before and after the intervention. We find that utilizing the \"See less\" ad control for the topics we study does not significantly reduce the number of ads shown by Meta on these topics, and that the control is less effective for some users whose demographics are correlated with the topic. Furthermore, we find that the majority of ad targeting explanations for local ads made no reference to location-specific targeting criteria, and did not inform users why ads related to the topics they requested to \"See less\" of continued to be delivered. We hypothesize that the poor effectiveness of controls and lack of actionability and comprehensiveness in explanations are the result of the shift to AI-mediated targeting, for which explainability and transparency tools have not yet been developed by Meta. Our work thus provides evidence for the need of new methods for transparency and user control, suitable and reflective of how the increasingly complex and AI-mediated ad delivery systems operate.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "In the first quarter of 2024, Meta brought in $35.6 billion in ad revenue (Meta 2024b), with their targeted advertising and matching systems helping advertisers reach new and existing audiences for whom the ads are particularly relevant (Meta 2022a). However, extensive prior work now details the harms that such targeted ads, pushed to users' feeds based on information collected about them without their explicit control, can have on users. For example, ads on subjects such as body weight control and image can increase anxiety and threaten users' health (Gak, Olojo, and Salehi 2022). Queer users have pointed out the dangers of targeted advertising in violating their privacy and control over their identity, and expressed the need for better explanations and controls to mediate the information and assumptions used to target their ads (Sampson, Encarnacion, and Metaxa 2023). Users with particular health conditions note the helplessness and trauma they feel when ads related to their health are forced onto their feed, with no way to completely stop these ads or prevent targeting based on inferred traits (Wu et al. 2023).\nIn response to these harms, Facebook (currently Meta) built a suite of user-facing tools such as ad preferences and individual ad targeting explanations, aimed to give users control and agency over the ads they see. A key ad personalization control tool is a button that allows users to mark \"See less\" to specific ad topics in Ad Preferences. Facebook promises that after marking \"See less\" for a topic, advertisers won't be able to target the user by specifying an interest in that topic for all future ads (shown in Figure 2) (Facebook Help Center 2024). A key transparency control tool is the \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" interface (shown in Figure 1) at the top of each ad (Meta 2019), which Facebook promises details the advertiser choices and user activity that informed that ad's delivery. Furthermore, the explanations are aimed to help users inform their ad control choices, as they provide a key entry point to the ad preferences.\nPrevious work has already found these controls to have limited accessibility (Hsu et al. 2020) and the ad explanations to not be fully transparent (Andreou et al. 2018). Our main focus is understanding whether the effectiveness of these controls and explanations are further hampered by the recent shift to AI-mediated targeting on Meta.\nThe shift to AI-mediated targeting has been a result of the introduction of new privacy protections and restrictions on targeting due to regulatory, competition, civil rights and political considerations. In particular, new data privacy policies, such as Apple's App Tracking Transparency, have pressured Facebook to develop mechanisms to find audiences to deliver ads to while having less direct access to user data, especially from the advertisers. Furthermore, in response to a 2018 civil rights settlement on discrimination in employment advertising (ACLU 2018), a 2022 settlement on discrimination in housing advertising (The US Department of Justice 2022), and continued public pressure on the potential harms of political advertising (Shane 2017; Ribeiro et al. 2019; Weintraub 2019), Facebook has removed thousands of targeting categories from its advertiser-facing tools from 2022 to 2024 (Meta 2021, 2024c; Sapiezynski et al. 2024) and now aims to decrease skew in delivery of housing and employment ads (Austin 2022, 2023; Bogen et al. 2023; Timmaraju et al. 2023).\nAt the same time, to continue delivering on its message of the value of personalized advertising to users and the value of helping the advertisers reach the right audiences, Facebook has introduced new AI-mediated targeting and audience selection tools and new server-side tracking tools (El fraihi et al. 2024). One such AI-mediated audience selection tool, Advantage+ Audiences (Meta 2022a), promises to improve advertiser experiences and reduce costs (Meta 2020, 2022b, 2024c), using AI to identify relevant users without explicit targeting criteria such as user demographics and interests provided by the advertiser. Instead, Advantage+ relies on data about users' past conversions and browsing behaviors, and ad interactions of users that are algorithmically deemed similar, to narrow audiences on the advertisers' behalf (Meta 2024a).\nMuch of recent AI-based technology suffers from lack of interpretability and explainability, both due to its algorithmic complexity and due to the complexity of the data it relies upon (Lipton 2018; Poursabzi-Sangdeh et al. 2021). We thus hypothesize that the shift to AI-mediated targeting brings new challenges to the effectiveness of controls and explanations related to advertising personalization, as those tools likely have not kept pace with the shift to AI and are likely still built around categorical (i.e. demographic-, interest-, and activity-based) audience creation practices. We hypothesize that since Meta's suite of new Advantage+ tools no longer requires advertisers to supply precise targeting criteria, there is no clear pathway for users to see particular interests in their \"Why this ad?\" explanations, or for the ad delivery algorithm to act upon the \"See less\" user actions for specific topics. The result is lack of effectiveness of ad controls and explanations.\nOur work and contributions We perform a large-scale sociotechnical audit to measure how Facebook's ad matching algorithm responds to user-initiated changes in ad controls on the topics of Body Weight Control and Parenting in early 2024. We recruit a generic group of users and a group of users whose age and gender are correlated with interest in each topic to understand whether it is more difficult for users belonging to certain demographic groups to effectively opt-out of certain ad topics. We randomly assign our recruited participants to mark \"See less\" to the ad topics and measure whether there is an observable change in the number of ads those users subsequently receive about those topics. Finally, to provide insight into the impact of Advantage+ audiences on ad explanations, we collect the targeting explanations attached to each ad and quantify the misalignment between ad content and explanations.\nOur findings provide new quantitative evidence of the ineffectiveness of marking \"See less\" to the topics of Body Weight Control and Parenting. They also show that ad targeting explanations do not productively inform ad control changes, including for ads relating to topics that users have marked to \"See less\" of. We summarize our findings as follows:"}, {"title": "User Control", "content": "Providing users with control over the ads they see is crucial for maintaining their agency and safety. Ad delivery algorithms continue to show clickbait, untrustworthy, and distasteful ads despite including ad quality in their ad ranking process (Zeng, Kohno, and Roesner 2021). Ads can also cause psychological distress, loss of autonomy, changes to user behavior, and marginalization or traumatization (Wu et al. 2023).\nOur study of Facebook's ad controls focuses on ad topic controls, inferred from users' activities and used in ad explanations. For users with histories of disordered eating, targeted advertising worsened anxiety surrounding food and exercise and negatively impacted self-esteem (Gak, Olojo, and Salehi 2022). For years, women have noted their inability to see fewer ads related to pregnancy and children's health, increasing anxiety and forcing them to revisit trauma (Brockell 2018; Contreras 2022). While users cannot fully remove assigned ad topics, they can mark \"See less\" to ads relating to these topics. Given users' expressed desires to exert control over ads relating to Body Weight Control and Parenting, we focus on these topics in our study of effectiveness of Facebook's \"See less\" ad control.\nDespite Facebook's communications regarding the power and value of its ad personalization and transparency control tools (Meta 2019; Facebook Help Center 2024), research continues to find that current systems have ineffective algorithmic controls, opaque and misleading explanations, and poorly designed interfaces, all reducing user agency (Chromik et al. 2019). Other studies have emphasized the lack of usability of existing ad interfaces, (Habib et al. 2020, 2022; Leon et al. 2012), arguing that controls are not sufficiently accessible nor are they aligned with user needs."}, {"title": "Algorithmic Transparency", "content": "Given the complexity of AI-mediated ad targeting systems, algorithmic transparency is crucial for users' understanding of how their data is used to make ad delivery decisions and inform ad control changes. When users do not fully understand AI systems, they build their own inferences about how the algorithm functions (Yuan et al. 2023) and expect improvement (Smith-Renner et al. 2020), which can lead to misinformed attempts at control and frustration. Users also note the importance of accurate ad explanations for ads leveraging personal data, interest targeting, and custom audiences to maintain a sense of control over their data (Lee et al. 2023; Wei et al. 2020), and their desire to understand how algorithms use their information to make inferences (Dolin et al. 2018; Eslami et al. 2018). Transparent explanations and opportunities for feedback through ad controls help inform productive choices over AI-mediated decisions and user data (Smith-Renner et al. 2020).\nRecent research by (Chouaki et al. 2022) suggests that changes to Facebook's ad platform have driven a shift away from advertiser-driven microtargeting, finding that the majority of ads did not use microtargeting in comparison to a 2018 study (Caba\u00f1as, Cuevas, and Cuevas 2018). We hypothesize that shift towards generic, AI-mediated targeting threatens transparency, since ad delivery algorithms can no longer rely on advertiser targeting criteria to explain ad delivery, creating new transparency challenges.\nAdditionally, many problematic ads use no targeting, indicating that the ad delivery algorithm perceives them as relevant to users rather than delivering them based on audience targeting (Ali et al. 2023). When ad explanations are incomplete or incorrect, users may still attempt to infer explanations and are hesitant to blame algorithmic error, mis-informing future actions to control their ads (Eslami et al. 2018; Rader and Gray 2015). Complete, accurate, and actionable ad explanations are thus necessary for expressing what data was used to inform ad delivery and provide users with information to make productive ad control changes."}, {"title": "Algorithmic Audits", "content": "Algorithmic audits are essential tools for investigating the mechanisms of black-box ad delivery systems to uncover their impacts on privacy, fairness, polarization, and user experiences. Previous investigations into Facebook's ad targeting revealed that it led to privacy threats to users' personal information (Faizullabhoy and Korolova 2018; Korolova 2011); the Meta Pixel sent sensitive medical information to advertisers (Feathers et al. 2022), and that adversaries could uncover users' phone numbers and site visits by reconstructing custom audience data (Venkatadri et al. 2018). Audits also revealed discriminatory ad delivery, with algorithms inequitably delivering harmful ads (Ali et al. 2022), housing and employment ads (Ali et al. 2019; Nagaraj Rao and Korolova 2023; Imana, Korolova, and Heidemann 2021), and education ads (Imana, Korolova, and Heidemann 2024), and contributing to echo chambers in political advertising (Ali et al. 2021). Researchers have also found that custom audiences can introduce bias (Sapiezynski et al. 2022) and amplify existing bias (Speicher et al. 2018) in advertiser audiences. Large-scale user audits provide insight into user experiences with ad systems, such as issues with ad controls (Datta, Tschantz, and Datta 2015; Habib et al. 2022), perceptions of problematic ads (Zeng, Kohno, and Roesner 2021), and preferred ad explanations (Lee et al. 2023; Wei et al. 2020).\nUsing a large-scale user audit, our study addresses a gap in existing research by providing quantitative evidence of the ineffectiveness of Facebook's ad topic controls and the poor actionability of their targeting mechanism, prompted by the shift to AI-mediated targeting, marketed as Advantage+ audiences."}, {"title": "Facebook's Commitments to Users", "content": "Facebook introduced the \"See less\" ad control in 2021 followed by an update in 2022, just four months before the release of Advantage+ audiences (Meta 2022a), promising that the ad topic control allows users to restrict the interest targeting categories used to reach them and the exert control over the ad content they see by opting to see fewer ads relating to certain topics (Meta 2021). Figure 2 shows their claim to users that \"you won't get as many ads about that topic and advertisers can't target you based on an interest in it\" (Facebook Help Center 2024).\nWhen we tested the \"See less\" control in 2024, Facebook returned a popup message indicating that an ad control setting had been changed, shown in Figure 2. The commitment to show fewer related ads \"soon\" is vague, but we still expect users to see fewer related ads to a topic they have marked to \"See less\" of over a period of a couple weeks."}, {"title": "Ad Explanations", "content": "One of Facebook's five pillars of AI (Pesenti 2021) is \"Transparency & Control.\" One mechanism to uphold this pillar is the \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" interface attached to each ad, initially debuted in 2014 (Meta 2019). The \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" interface includes an \"Advertiser Choices\" section listing an advertiser's targeting mechanisms, such as profile information, custom audiences, interests, and location (Meta 2019). A 2023 update adds a \"Your activity\" section listing previous user activity that influenced ad delivery, outputted by machine learning models similar to the ones that inform ad delivery (shown in Figure 6) to further increase transparency (Meta 2023). To be fully transparent, we expect these explanations to contain all of the \"Advertiser Choices\" that led to a user being targeted."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In this section, we describe the structure of our user survey to perform a large-scale sociotechnical audit of Facebook's ad controls and ad explanations for two topics: Parenting and Body Weight Control.

Given the inherently limited scope of our study, we chose these topics due to previously expressed concerns about ads worsening trauma related to parenting (Brockell 2018; Contreras 2022) or exacerbating food- and exercise-related anxiety (Gak, Olojo, and Salehi 2022). Participants in each set match the following screening characteristics:\n\u2022 Parenting: Has a child less than 10 years old, currently living with their child, uses Facebook.\n\u2022 Body Weight Control: Has gone on a diet in the past, marked \"Health & Fitness\" as a hobby, exercises \"Sometimes\" or \"Often,\" uses Facebook.\nFurthermore, to test our hypothesis that it is more difficult for users belonging to demographic groups that Facebook deems correlated with the topics to effectively change the ads they see via the provided \u201cSee less\u201d controls we develop the following correlated demographics for each interest, used in combination with our previous screeners:\n\u2022 Parenting: Women aged 25 to 45, since they are most likely to be new parents (Bui and Miller 2018).\n\u2022 Body Weight Control: Women aged 18 to 59 and men aged 40 to 59, since these groups are most likely to have experiences with dieting and weight loss (Martin et al. 2019).\nIn sum, we recruit 201 participants, 110 from the Parenting screener, of whom 68 match the Parenting correlated demographic, and 91 from the Body Weight Control (BWC) screener, of whom 31 match the correlated demographic.

Specifically, we compare the median change in related ads over time between the control and intervention groups. Our analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in the decrease of related ads between the control and intervention groups for Parenting or Body Weight Control, suggesting that the \"See less\" ad control does not meaningfully reduce the number of ads related to the blocked topic.\nFirst, we calculate the change in relatedness from Round 0 to Round 2 for user u as \u03b4u:\n$\\delta u = r_u^{(2)} \u2013 r_u^{(0)}$.\nThen, we find the median change in the proportion of related ads experienced by a subset of participants in group S, $m_S$:\n$m_S = median((\\delta u), for u \\in S)$.\nWe compare $m_S$ for the control and intervention groups, denoted $m_s^{P,C}, m_s^{P,I}$ for the topic Parenting and $m_s^{B,C}, m_s^{B,I}$ for the topic Body Weight Control.

We find that for the topic Body Weight Control, participants in non-correlated demographics see a stronger increase in the average proportion of related ads shown than participants in correlated demographics, while for the topic Parenting, participants in correlated demographics see an increase in the average proportion of related ads shown while those in non-correlated demographics see a decrease."}, {"title": "Testing for Significance across Demographic Types", "content": "We also compare the median change in related ads over time between participants who marked \"See less\" belonging to correlated demographics versus those not belonging to correlated demographics using a Mann-Whitney U test.

Therefore, to gain circumstantial evidence of the prevalence of Advantage+ audience use, we first measure the frequency of location-specific criteria in the ad targeting information of local ads. We then measure whether topic-specific ads indicate that they were targeted using that particular topic. We hypothesize that ads delivered using Advantage+ audience selection only return generic information about their location and interest targeting in the explanations, and thus the above measurements would be good proxies. We find that the majority of location-specific ads do not reference location information in targeting explanations, and the majority of ads related to specific interests only return generic targeting information.

We now detail how we label ads as location-specific and classify targeting information into three types: generic, activity-based, and interest-based.\nLabeling Local Ads To classify ads as local, we establish specific criteria based on the ad creative's content. An ad is labeled as local if it references products and services that are geographically constrained, meaning they are only accessible to users within a particular area. We use the following criteria to determine whether an ad is local:\n\u2022 Geographic references: ad explicitly references a specific state, city, town, or neighborhood, excluding vacation ads.\n\u2022 Location-based services: ad references services that are inherently local, such as real estate listings, local events, or health services.\n\u2022 Contact Information: ad lists local phone number, address, or directions indicating a specific location."}, {"title": "Targeting Explanations by Ad Type", "content": "Local Ads We now present our findings for local ads and their explanations (see Figure 7). To uphold actionability and faithfulness to ad content, we expect local ads to specify either location-specific targeting or activity-related information in the explanations. We find that this is not the case 67% of local ads only included generic targeting information, while 17% listed interest-related targeting information and 16% listed activity-related targeting information. Thus, for the vast majority of local ads, the explanations are not faithful or actionable, as we would expect local ads to either list local targeting or activity-based targeting as reasoning why it was delivered to specific users. We cannot reliably tell whether the underlying reason for generic targeting is Advantage+, but AI-mediated audience selection is one likely explanation for such a prevalence of missing local or activity information. The lack of faithfulness for local ads makes it challenging for users to understand what controls to leverage.\nInterest-Specific Ads We now present our analysis of the targeting information attached to the 222 related ads delivered in Round 2, one week after the \"See less\" intervention. We focus on Round 2 since these ads were delivered after we would expect the intervention to be fully effective. Therefore, we expect faithful explanations to inform participants why an ad was delivered despite the control, rather than returning generic targeting explanations that do not reference the user's expressed preferences to \u201cSee less.\u201d\nWe calculate the proportion of generic, interest-based, and activity-based targeting information for the control and intervention groups, shown in Figure 8.

Along with Chouaki et al., we attribute these issues in user-facing controls and transparency tools to the recent shift from advertiser microtargeting to AI-mediated audience selection (Meta 2022a).\nBroadly, our findings illustrate the significant challenges in preserving transparency, actionability, and user control over complex AI systems. Previous research has highlighted the difficulty of balancing data deletion with explainable decisions in AI-mediated recommendation systems (Pawelczyk et al. 2023). As new data privacy regulations and governance protections emerge, it is crucial to investigate how AI systems can support users' rights to transparency and control while employing AI-mediated targeting mechanisms.\nMore specifically, our findings reflect a fundamental misalignment between Facebook's existing ad controls and explanations with their new ad delivery system. Advantage+ audience selection shows how AI can improve ad targeting while reducing the collection of user data, potentially improving privacy, but this improvement currently comes at the cost of effectiveness of user-facing control and faithfulness in the transparency of ad targeting decisions. Therefore, future research, especially from platforms, is necessary to develop new mechanisms for transparency and user control that align with the shift to AI-mediated ad targeting and delivery systems."}, {"title": "Limitations & Future Work", "content": "First, our study collected a relatively low number of ads, collecting a maximum of 22 ads per participant, instead aiming to attract and retain a high number of participants.

This paper proposes OWL2Vec40A, an extension of the ontology embedding system OWL2Vec*. While OWL2Vec has emerged as a powerful technique for ontology embedding, it currently lacks a mechanism to tailor the embedding to the ontology alignment task. OWL2Vec40A incorporates edge confidence values from seed map- pings to guide the random walk strategy. We present the theoretical foundations, implementation details, and experimental evaluation of our proposed extension, demonstrating its potential effectiveness for ontology alignment tasks.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Knowledge graphs (and ontologies) are increasingly recognized as essential for successful AI implementations across various data science applications [14]. On- tology alignment is a crucial task to enable semantic interoperability and en- hance the application of knowledge graphs. The ontology alignment process in- volves finding and harmonizing semantic connections between different ontolo- gies. While current methods have advanced ontology alignment considerably, there remain obstacles to their widespread implementation [20,31]. The ontology matching community has contributed to the evolution of on- tology alignment systems for the last twenty years with the organization of the annual Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) [36,35]. In recent years there has been a shift from traditional systems [11], using lexical and struc- tural techniques, to systems using machine learning and large language models. Prominent examples include LogMap-ML [5], BertMap [21], DeepAlignment [29], VeeAlign [26], SORBETMatcher [15] and OLaLa [24]. The OAEI, with the new Bio-ML track [23,22], has also evolved accordingly to attract and systematically evaluate such systems."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "Ontologies and knowledge graphs. Ontologies serve as structured, clearly defined representations of collectively agreed-upon concepts and relationships within a specific field or area of interest [17]. Widely applied in information retrieval, data integration, and knowledge-based systems, ontologies facilitate semantic interoperability and reasoning across diverse applications. Knowledge graphs [25] have recently gained attention to represent entities and relationships within a"}, {"title": "3 Related Work", "content": "The ongoing research in the ontology matching community evidences the need for more sophisticated techniques, as shown in the annual OAEI campaign [35] new methodologies and systems are developed to address this challenging problem in the Semantic Web. Otero-Cerdeira et al. [33] provides a comprehensive survey of ontology matching techniques. These diverse approaches demonstrate the complexity of ontology alignment and the variety of techniques employed [12]. Nonetheless, ontology matching tools can now process more efficiently even the most complex ontologies, includ- ing those with hundreds of thousands of classes, encompassing billions of possi- ble connections. Recent advancements in ontology matching have incorporated machine learning, including embedding-based techniques and (large) language models, showing promising results in improving alignment accuracy (e.g., [5], [21]). These approaches leverage vector representations of ontological elements to capture semantic relationships more effectively than traditional methods.

OWL2Vec4OA has been tailored to the ontology alignment task by using a preliminary set of ontology alignments, possibly incomplete or inaccurate, to bridge a given set of input ontologies. These seed mappings and their confidence are key when performing biased random walks to create se- quences of entities from both ontologies. The results section shows promising results where the OWL2Vec4OA embeddings lead to much better-ranking results than those computed by OWL2Vec*. Currently, our experiments rely on direct embedding comparison which leads to good similarity results. However, predicting equivalent or subsumption map- pings is a more complex task. In the near future, we aim at training machine learning models to better benefit from the features of the OWL2Vec4OA embed- dings for an ontology alignment task. Prominent examples in the literature are LogMap-ML [5], which successfully applied a Siamese neural network; and Hao et al. [19], which explored the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNN). These approaches, however, created embeddings that were independent for each input ontology, unlike those computed by OWL2Vec4OA. In addition, we also plan to conduct additional experiments to better un- derstand the impact of the walk depth with different strategies to create entity sequences (i.e., focusing on concepts and/or avoiding OWL constructs). Entity embedding can also be constructed using the word embedding associated to their labels, which may bring additional features with respect to the URI embeddings. Finally, once we have an end-to-end ontology alignment system in place, we aim to participate in the OAEI campaign and perform an extensive comparison with the state-of-the-art."}]}

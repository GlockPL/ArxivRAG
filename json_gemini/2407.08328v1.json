The reports underwent preprocessing, annotation using the Safety Intelligence Research taxonomy, and topic modelling to uncover prevalent topics and detect differences in maternity care across ethnic groups. A combination of offline and online methods was utilised to ensure data protection whilst enabling advanced analysis, with offline processing for sensitive data and online processing for non-sensitive data using the 'Claude 3 Opus' language model. Interactive topic analysis and semantic network visualisation were employed to extract and display thematic topics and visualise semantic relationships among keywords. The analysis revealed disparities in care among different ethnic groups, with distinct focus areas for the Black, Asian, and White British ethnic groups. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of topic modelling and NLP techniques in analysing maternity incident investigation reports and highlighting disparities in care.

The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) was an independent organisation established to investigate patient safety incidents within the NHS in England. Established in 2017 and funded by the Department of Health and Social Care, HSIB aimed to improve patient safety through its investigations. In October 2023, HSIB transformed into two organisations: the Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (MNSI), which is hosted by the Care Quality Commission, and the Health Services Safety Investigations Body"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Dataset of maternity incident investigation reports", "content": "The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) provided a random set of 188 anonymised investigation reports describing adverse maternity incidents. The reports were written between 2019 to 2022. The number of reports for each year is as follows: 4 reports in 2019, 115 reports in 2020, 42 reports in 2021, and 27 reports in 2022. Ethnicity was provided for 76 reports. The reports were processed, and the output was a text file (in CSV format) containing File IDs, Sentence IDs, sentence, and concepts from the Safety Intelligence ResearCH (SIRch) taxonomy. During the processing phase, the files underwent cleaning, involving the selection of specific sentences from each report. The sentence selection process focused on identifying sentences that contained negative connotations, references to physical characteristics, and mentions of medication names related to dispensing medications. The selected sentences were annotated using the SIRch taxonomy and compiled into a CSV file, which is utilised for clustering and summarisation tasks. This concept annotation task was carried out using our I-SIRch tool, and the process is described in [4]."}, {"title": "2.2 Topic modelling and semantic network visualisation methods", "content": "Textual data analysis and topic modeling.

Recognising and addressing these risks is crucial for conducting rigorous and responsible research.\nBias amplification: When a dataset predominantly contains sentences from one ethnic group, it may overrepresent the perspectives and experiences of that group, potentially perpetuating stereotypes or inaccuracies. Mitigation: Enrich the dataset through targeted recruitment from under-represented groups and employ statistical techniques to adjust for imbalances, ensuring ethical collection of real, representative data.\nMisinterpretation of topics/themes: Data skew may lead to thematic outcomes that reflect the overrepresented group's concerns, possibly mischaracterising crucial topics relevant to other groups.

It introduces an analytical framework to highlight disparities in care among ethnic groups, pointing out the necessity for focused improvement efforts. The reports underwent data preprocessing, annotation using the SIRch taxonomy, and topic modelling using LDA to identify unique topics based on different combinations of concepts and ethnic groups. To ensure the protection of sensitive data whilst enabling advanced analysis, a combination of offline and online methods was utilised, with offline processing used for sensitive data and online processing for non-sensitive data (i.e. keywords of topics as shown in the Table 2 extract) using the 'Claude 3 Opus' language model. Interactive topic analysis and semantic network visualisation were employed to extract and display thematic topics and visualise semantic relationships among keywords.\nThe research acknowledges potential drawbacks of analysing unbalanced datasets, such as the risk of bias amplification, misinterpretation of themes/topics, ethical issues, and the possible loss of important insights. The findings reveal systemic issues within maternity services, setting the stage for strategies informed by data to prevent incidents and enhance patient care. Involving stakeholders and experts ensures that the insights from the analysis are relevant and contribute to targeted measures to improve healthcare equity and outcomes. A notable limitation of the proposed topic modelling tool is the absence of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) in evaluating its outputs. PPI plays a vital role, ensuring that the derived solutions are aligned with patient needs and experiences, which could significantly refine the topic summaries and their applicability in real-world scenarios. Incorporating input from patients and the public would likely enhance the model's transparency and trust, making it more reliable. Future enhancements will focus on incorporating PPI feedback to improve the framework's efficiency in topic modelling, ultimately contributing to better patient safety and care quality."}]}

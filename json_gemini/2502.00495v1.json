Introduction", "content": "Enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human\nbeing (WHO statement) [34]. The increasing availability of computer-mediated knowledge and the\nadvancement of information and communication technologies have altered the methods through which\nhealth care information is sought [3] [25] [30]. The Internet has had a significant impact on healthcare\nservice and is a virtual medical library for an estimated 75\u201380% of users in developed countries [4] [5]\n[11]. On an average day, more than six million patients and their caregivers in the United States use the\nInternet to obtain health and medical information. This number exceeds the average daily number of 2.27\nmillion Americans who make visits to physician offices [11] [18] [26]. Furthermore, not only patients but\ntheir caregivers want to get actively involved in the health-care management of their loved ones. In a\nresearch nearly 60% of people who identified themselves as caregivers use the Internet to find answers to\ntheir health-related questions [16].\nThis computer mediated environment has become, as Vargo and Lusch [32] argue, a fundamental hub\nwhere \"people exchange to acquire the benefits of specialized competencies (knowledge and skills), or\nservices.\""}, {"title": "2.

Artificial Intelligence and Health Care Systems", "content": "Nowadays, researchers are increasingly using information technology to examine new and innovative\ntechniques to overcome the rapid surge in health care costs facing the community. Research undertaken in\nthe past has shown that artificial intelligence (AI) tools and techniques can aid in the diagnosis of disease\nand the assessment of treatment outcomes. [1] Recent developments in information technology and AI\ntools, particularly in neural networks, fuzzy logic and support vector machines, have provided the\nnecessary support to develop highly efficient automated diagnostic systems. Despite plenty of challenges,\nthese new advances in AI tools hold much promise for solving medical and health-related problems.[2] [9]\nThere have been a number of artificial intelligence (AI) tools developed over the past decade or so [10]\n[14]. Many of these have found their applications in medical and health-related areas. Commonly applied\nAl techniques can be listed as: Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machines, Genetic\nAlgorithms and Hybrid Systems. In addition to applications in medical diagnostic systems, AI techniques\nhave been applied in many biomedical signal-processing tasks [19]. Neural network models have played a\ndominant role in the majority of AI-related applications in health and medicine. Many of these applications\nare for pattern recognition or classification. A typical classification application usually has a number of\nsteps or procedures, as shown by the flow diagram (see Fig. 1). This involves feature extraction from the\ninput data before feeding these features to the classifier for designing and developing automated\nclassification models, and finally testing the models for generalization."}, {"title": "4. Intelligent Agents and Life-Like Agents", "content": "Life-Like agents are a special kind of so-called intelligent software agents. Software agent technology\nthat originated from distributed artificial intelligence is inherently interdisciplinary. Thus, the notion of\nagency is quite broadly used in the literature; it can be seen as a tool for analyzing systems, not an absolute\ncharacterization that divides the world into agents and non-agents [12] [33]. However, intelligent agents\nare commonly assumed to exhibit autonomous behavior determined by their:\n\u2022\npro-activeness, which means taking the initiative to satisfy given design objectives and exhibiting\ngoal-directed behavior\n\u2022\nReactive or deliberative actions, which means perceiving the environment and using timely change\nmanagement to meet given design objectives, and"}, {"title": "5. Our Life-Like Agent: Dr. Eve!", "content": "In our research we will use an advanced life-like agent named \"Dr. Eve\u201d that is a combination of a life-\nlike agent developed by one of the authors [22] [23] [24] and another open-source Life-Like agent as\nComputer-Mediated Communication tool. Dr. Eve is the beginning of a big change in the way everyone\nwill use and interact with computers as a health care advisor. Dr. Eve's Artificial Engine uses several\nalgorithms for its Artificial Intelligence. One of these layers uses AIML programming language. AIML\nstands for Artificial Intelligence Mark-up Language. It's an XML dialect for creating natural language\napplications, developed by Dr. Richard Wallace and a worldwide free software community [21]. AIML\ndescribes a class of data objects called AIML objects and partially describes the behavior of computer\nprograms that process them. AIML objects are made up of units called topics and categories, which contain\neither, parsed or unparsed data. Parsed data is made up of characters, some of which form character data,\nand some of which form AIML elements. AIML elements encapsulate the stimulus-response knowledge\ncontained in the document. Character data within these elements is sometimes parsed by an AIML\ninterpreter, and sometimes left unparsed for later processing by a Responder.\nFig. 2 shows our proposed system architecture. The main structure of the system consists of a\nknowledge-based schema. This knowledge base is fed by two main resources. The first is direct feeding by\ndesigners using AIML programming language. The second source of Dr. Eve's knowledge base is trusted\nwebsites.\nAs we mentioned above, many research have shown that healthcare consumers are concerned about\ngetting low-quality health information on the Web [20] so government intervention is warranted. Examples\nare: The United Kingdom's \"NHS Direct\", Australia's \"HealthInsite\", Canada's \"Canadian Health\nNetwork (CHN)\", and United States of America's \u201cHealthFinder\" sites [29]. These websites are usually\ndesigned as a trusted source of health care information, and they could be the source of Dr. Eve's\nknowledge base as well.\nDr. Eve interacts with users using speech recognition module and Text to Speech (TTS) module. With\nspeech recognition module Dr. Eve will try to understand all single word users say and will try to find the\nbest answer to their question using her knowledge base. With text to speech module Dr. Eve talks to users\nas native female English speaker.\nThe face plays a significant role in social communication since it is a 'window' to human personality,\nemotions and thoughts. According to the psychological research conducted by Mehrabian [17], the\nnonverbal part is the most informative channel in social communication. As the lack of interaction and no\""}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "In this paper we reviewed some important trends in health care services and presented a new system\nbased on Artificial Intelligence and Life-Like Intelligent Agents. This system is a new idea in patient\nhealth care systems interaction and we believe that it could change the future of health care services. At\nthis stage Dr. Eve is supported by some basic modules like Text To speech (TTS), Facial Expression and\nSpeech recognition. At the next stage Dr. Eve could develop by\n\u2022\nUsing Facial Expression Recognition (FER) technology to improve her communication ability\n\u2022\nUsing image processing technology to improve her diagnostics ability\n\u2022\nUsing other diagnostic tools like digital sphygmomanometer, electrocardiogram (ECG) and\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) to improve her diagnostics ability."}]}

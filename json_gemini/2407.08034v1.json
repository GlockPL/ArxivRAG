INTRODUCTION", "content": "Traffic flow estimation (TFE) plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), providing real-time traffic flow information to ITS applications including route planning and traffic management [1], [2]. Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) with connected vehicles offers a way for TFE that uses the average speeds of probe vehicles in each region or road segment to represent traffic flow [3], [4]. Given the cost of data collection and user privacy, obtaining a massive amount of probe vehicle data (PVD) is difficult in practical applications. As a result, TFE typically needs to be performed on a sparse PVD obtained from a limited number of sparsely distributed connected vehicles throughout the city.\nHowever, inadequate PVD poses a challenge to accurately estimating traffic flow [5]. According to the central limit theorem in statistics, the mean of a small number of samples has a Gaussian error relative to the mean of the entire population.\nFor TFE using sparse PVD, data sparsification results in fewer samples in each region, which further introduces Gaussian errors into the estimates of each region. In addition, the PVD sparsification sometimes even results in the absence of samples in certain areas. Therefore, the initial estimation that directly uses the average speeds obtained from sparse PVD cannot provide an accurate estimation. The initial estimation by sparse PVD is subject to errors and misses in the initial estimations compared to the ideal estimation using average speeds obtained from a massive amount of PVD [3].\nFortunately, the presence of spatial-temporal correlations in the traffic flow makes it possible to further improve the accuracy of the initial estimations [6]. Spatial-temporal correlations reflect the inherent continuity and interconnectedness of traffic movements over time and space. Changes in traffic flow are not isolated to specific moments or locations but unfold continuously, demonstrating a seamless progression across both temporal and spatial dimensions [7], [8]. Temporal correlations in traffic flow may be influenced by various factors, while spatial correlations represent how traffic conditions vary across different geographical regions. With the information provided by the spatial-temporal correlation, we can modify the error or interpolate the missing with generative artificial intelligence (GAI) techniques by generating new TFE outcomes.\nConditional GAI is a powerful technique for generating high-quality and accurate TFE outcomes from low-quality initial estimations, contributing to cost-effective TFE from sparse PVD [9], [10]. Specifically, we propose to design a conditional GAI framework for TFE consists of two parts, the conditional encoder and the generative decoder. The conditional encoder is a spatial-temporal deep neural network for mining spatial-temporal correlations in the initial TFE results [11]. The output of the conditional encoder is a latent representation of the extracted spatial-temporal correlations, which will be used as conditions for the decoder. Based on the given conditions, the generative decoder utilize the generative model to produce new high-quality and accurate TFE outcomes as final outcomes [12]. The utilization of conditional GAI can effectively overcome the problem of low-quality estimation results caused by data sparsification and improve the accuracy of TFE.\nIn this paper, we propose a cost-effective sparse MCS approach for real-time TFE, which utilizes conditional GAI to generate accurate estimation using only the limited PVD. Specifically, we first collect sparse PVD, which includes GPS and travel speeds of connected vehicles that are sparsely and uniformly distributed. Then, the initial estimations are obtained by directly using the average speed of probe vehicles in each region or road segment. Finally, we employ spatial-temporal conditional GAI to refine and improve TFE outcomes, transforming the low-quality initial TFE results into accurate estimations. The major contributions of this paper are delineated as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a cost-effective sparse MCS approach for real-time TFE, where the data collocation overhead is reduced by collecting sparse PVD. The impact of data sparsification on TFE accuracy is analyzed.\n\u2022 We design a spatial-temporal conditional GAI framework to improve the TFE accuracy, which consists of a conditional encoder and a generative decoder. We further discuss spatial-temporal neural networks used in encoder for traffic correlations mining, and generative models used in decoder for generating accurate TFE outcomes.\n\u2022 Through a case study using a real dataset, we demonstrate the feasibility and validity of spatial-temporal conditional GAI for cost-effective TFE, which can be accurately estimated using sparse PVD.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the TFE using sparse PVD. Section III discusses the challenges in accurate TFE using sparse PVD. Section IV presents the spatial-temporal conditional GAI framework for TFE. Section V shows the case study of GAI-enabled TFE using sparse PVD. Section VI concludes this paper."}, {"title": "II. SPARSE MOBILE CROWDSENSING FOR TRAFFIC STATE ESTIMATION", "content": "TFE has multiple applications in ITS. Firstly, TFE underpins real-time traffic monitoring and management, empowering transportation authorities to rapidly address congestion, accidents, and various incidents. Secondly, TFE is instrumental in traffic planning and the optimization of infrastructure. By analyzing traffic flow patterns and trends, planners are equipped to formulate more strategic transportation plans to enhance the overall efficiency of traffic systems. Thirdly, TFE allows for the dynamic adjustment of traffic light timings in sync with real-time traffic conditions, which minimizes wait times and optimizes traffic flow at intersections.\nTFE typically employs roadside sensors or connected vehicles to collect and analyze real-time vehicle movement situations [13], [14]. TFE via roadside sensors requires a large number of devices to be deployed, which is costly. In contrast, the use of sparse PVD is a more cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Due to the inherent spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flows, PVD exhibits a certain degree of redundancy. For example, vehicles nearby will have similar speeds. This redundancy amplifies the burden of data collection. To address these issues, the innovative sparse MCS has been introduced. Sparse MCS effectively diminishes the overhead of PVD acquisition while preserving the integrity and precision of the estimation, capitalizing on spatial-temporal traffic correlations."}, {"title": "A. Framework of Sparse MCS", "content": "Sparse MCS is an approach within the broader concept of MCS that emphasizes the collection of data from a selected set of devices or areas, rather than the continuous collection of data from all sources [5]. Reducing data requirements helps to minimize waste and overhead of data collection, transmission, and storage resources, but additional steps need to be taken to ensure that sensing accuracy can meet requirements.\nOur sparse MCS TFE approach is shown in Fig. 1, which improves the estimation accuracy through conditional GAI based on spatial-temporal correlation in traffic flow. The first step is to collect driving information through vehicular networks, mainly including vehicle GPS coordinates, vehicle traveling direction, and vehicle speed. In sparse MCS, the sparse PVD is collected from sparsely and uniformly distributed connected vehicles across the entire urban area. Unlike sparing the data by region or road segment, we sparse the data from the source for the following reasons. Firstly, the high mobility of vehicles complicates the demarcation of regions. Second, it is impractical to collect information of all vehicles within the road network, and therefore, available PVD can be considered to be sparsed at the data source. Thirdly, collecting PVD from widely distributed vehicles provides a more comprehensive coverage and hence a more complete picture of the traffic situation.\nOnce the sparse PVD is collected, the next step is data processing. Road matching is first performed, which involves comparing the vehicle's GPS coordinates with known road maps to accurately determine the specific road or region on which the vehicle is traveling. Subsequently, we calculated low-quality initial TFE results by calculating the average speed of the vehicles in each region over a specified past time. These average speeds represent the current traffic flow speed in each region. Initial TFE results from previous and current times are used as inputs to the spatial-temporal conditional GAI. The GAI uses the conditional encoder to mine spatial-temporal correlations in the initial TFE results and uses the generative decoder to generate new high-quality and accurate TFE outcomes as final outcomes."}, {"title": "B. Benefit of Sparse MCS", "content": "The application of sparse MCS has significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, scalability, and robustness:\n1) Cost-effectiveness: Sparse MCS is cost-effective by collecting smaller quantities of PVD. This reduces unnecessary expenses associated with the collection of large volumes of PVD, including overhead associated with acquisition, transmission, and storage. It fully optimizes the use of available resources and maximizes the value of the data.\n2) Scalability: Unlike traditional road sensors, which are limited by their physical location and coverage, sparse MCS can take advantage of the wide coverage of connected vehicles. As long as the vehicles are equipped with the appropriate sensors, the sensing network has the potential to extend to any area, providing a highly scalable solution for a variety of applications and environments.\n3) Robustness: Sparse MCS is robust and reduces the stringent requirements on PVD quality. This approach is robust enough to cope with situations where PVDs may be scarce or missing in certain regions or at specific times, ensuring that the system remains effective despite reduced data volumes. For startups, this robustness allows them to achieve accurate TFE from relatively small amounts of user data, providing precise information that is invaluable for other applications."}, {"title": "III. CHALLENGES OF ACCURATE TFE FROM SPARSE PVD", "content": "In general, the accuracy of MCS is highly dependent on the amount of data collected, as is the case for TFE. The accuracy is also reduced when using sparse PVD to directly estimate traffic flow. Fortunately, by exploiting the spatial-temporal correlation of traffic flow, the accuracy of TFE can be further improved."}, {"title": "A. Effect of PVD Sparsification", "content": "Data sparsification for PVD has two significant effects on the initial TFE results, namely accuracy and completeness [6]. The reduced sample size associated with data sparsification affects the accuracy of the estimates. This is because averages derived from a limited number of samples may be biased or inaccurate. Besides, the sparse PVD collected may provide incomplete coverage of roads, resulting in missing estimates for some roads.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the PVD for TFE is sparsed at the data source, i.e., information is collected from fewer connected vehicles. For a single road, the blue curve represents an ideal, high-quality estimations of traffic flow derived from a large number of PVD, and the yellow curve represents the estimation derived from sparse PVD. Zero values in the yellow curve indicate missing estimates due to the lack of collected PVD for the road at a given time. The speeds estimated from the sparse PVD tend to fluctuate around the ideal value and occasionally have missing data points. For a city-wide estimation, the left inset shows a map of ideal traffic flow speeds derived from a large number of PVD, while the right inset shows a map of speeds derived from sparse PVD. The above results demonstrate that data sparsification introduces errors and missing values in the initial TFE results.\nFig. 3 shows the distribution of city-wide estimation errors for different levels of data sparsity. These errors typically follow a Gaussian distribution, consistent with the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the mean of a small number of samples will exhibit a Gaussian error relative to the mean of the entire population. Notably, the positive portion of the curve is higher than the negative portion. This asymmetry in the distribution of the error is caused by missing data since the missing values set to zero therein are always smaller than the ideal value. Therefore, it is possible to make rough estimations of traffic flow with sparse data despite the presence of Gaussian errors and missing values."}, {"title": "B. Spatial-Temporal Correlations", "content": "Spatial-temporal correlations of traffic flows are formed by complex dependencies of traffic data in the spatial and temporal dimensions. In transport systems, the state of traffic at one location affects or is correlated with the state of traffic at another location, and these relationships change over time. Spatial correlation means that traffic behavior in one region will affect nearby regions, often leading to congestion spreading throughout the road network, e.g. congestion on one road will likely lead to congestion on neighboring roads. Temporal correlation describes patterns and relationships in the evolution of traffic conditions over time and is characterized by cyclical changes in traffic flows with continuous fluctuations rather than sudden changes."}, {"title": "C. Key Challenges", "content": "The use of sparse PVD for accurate TFE faces significant challenges due to the effects of PVD sparsification. Thankfully, the use of spatial-temporal correlations in traffic flow can lead to accurate estimations from initial estimations. With the additional information provided by spatial-temporal correlations, we can fully understand the dynamic properties of the traffic network. Even in sparse PVD, there are still rich spatial-temporal correlations that help to accurately reconstruct the traffic flows and thus achieve accurate TFE. However, achieving accurate and comprehensive traffic flow estimates using sparse PVD remains a formidable challenge [15]. This difficulty mainly arises from the complexity involved in capturing and effectively utilizing spatial-temporal correlations in dynamic traffic flows, which are inherently intricate."}, {"title": "IV. SPATIAL-TEMPORAL CONDITIONAL GAI", "content": "The spatial-temporal conditional GAI framework, shown in Fig. 4, employs an encoding-decoding architecture to generate high-quality outcomes and enhance the accuracy of TFE by mining spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data. Depending on the road map format, these initial estimations obtained from sparse PVD are organized as either grid-structured or graph-structured data. By arranging these estimations chronologically including both historical and current data, we create a sequence of grid or graph-structured estimations with rich spatial-temporal correlations. These sequential data are used as inputs to the conditional encoder, which extracts and utilizes these correlations as conditions for the generative decoder. Subsequently, the generative decoder uses these conditioned inputs to produce high-quality, accurate TFE outcomes.\nThe cornerstone of our proposed framework is the effective capture of spatial-temporal correlations in traffic flow, achieved through the conditional encoder. The backbone of the conditional encoder is the spatial-temporal deep neural network, which consists of two modules cascaded together, one responsible for capturing spatial correlation and the other for capturing temporal correlation. The following offers an overview of the various neural network models that can be employed within the spatial-temporal conditional encoder, highlighting their capabilities and roles in enhancing the accuracy of TFE."}, {"title": "A. Models for Spatial Correlations Mining", "content": "Spatial correlations delineate the intricate interconnections among various regions within a transportation network. To efficaciously extract the spatial correlations embedded in data formats structured as grids or graphs, the deployment of specialized deep neural networks is indispensable, adapting the complexities inherent in traffic flow data. The judicious selection and application of optimal neural network architectures are crucial for accurately capturing these spatial correlations, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy of TFE.\n1) Grid: Grid data is arranged in a matrix-like grid pattern, with each value occupying a unique position across rows and columns. This structured approach is leveraged to partition urban maps into uniform grids, resulting in grid-based representations of traffic dynamics. Two primary models can be used to learn spatial correlations of grid data: the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the vision transformer (ViT). The CNN discerns local features and spatial patterns via convolutional and pooling layers. It is particularly proficient in identifying localized traffic correlations, offering granular insights into traffic conduct. Conversely, the ViT segments images into patches, employing self-attention mechanisms to uncover spatial interrelations among these patches. It is adept at delineating the complex spatial interplay characteristic of traffic flow, thus providing a comprehensive view of traffic dynamics over expansive areas.\n2) Graph: Graph data structures encapsulate information through a network of nodes and edges, where nodes typically denote road segments, and edges signify the topological links between them. It transforms city maps into graphs with roads as the main focus, associating traffic flow data with road segments. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are adept at managing such graph-structured data. The graph convolutional network (GCN) employs a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions to aggregate information within the graph. Enhancing this methodology, the graph attention network (GAT) assigns varying attention weights to nodes, emphasizing significant node characteristics and their connections. Besides, the graph sample and aggregate neural network (GraphSAGE) is designed to learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood."}, {"title": "B. Models for Temporal Correlations Mining", "content": "Temporal correlation in traffic flow encapsulates the inter-dependencies between traffic conditions across different time intervals. It suggests that present traffic states are not isolated events but are consequentially linked to antecedent and subsequent traffic states. To adeptly harness these correlations, it is imperative to meticulously process sequential data and engage neural networks that are expressly designed to capture temporal dynamics.\n1) RNN: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are distinguished by their cyclical connections, enabling them to preserve a memory of antecedent inputs. The archetypal RNN iteratively updates its latent state at each temporal step by integrating the current input with the preceding latent state, facilitating the extraction of patterns and the retention of information across the data sequence. To overcome the difficulty of vanishing or exploding gradients, the advent of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks introduces specialized memory cells and gating mechanisms, empowering LSTMs to judiciously regulate information over protracted intervals. To further reduce the complex, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) reduces the complexity of the model by combining input and forget gates into a unified update gate.\n2) Attention: Attention-based models utilize the attention mechanism to effectively reveal intricate temporal associations in data sequences. The transformer with multi-head attention is adept at comprehensively modeling sequence data and proficiently managing long-distance dependencies. The informer uses the ProbSparse self-attention and multi-scale processing to efficiently predict over extensive periods. The retentive network (RetNet) incorporates a retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms: parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent, aiming to achieve training parallelism, low-cost inference, and high performance. These architectures have sophisticated attention mechanisms that provide a dual analytical perspective including global and local views, enabling a more nuanced understanding of traffic dynamics patterns.\n3) State Space Model: By integrating the state space model (SSM) architecture, Mamba synergistically leverages the strengths of RNNs and CNNs to provide a powerful solution for sequence data analysis. In the training phase, Mamba uses a convolutional strategy to collectively process the input sequences to ensure efficient operation. In the inference phase, Mamba switches to recurrent mode. This innovative dual-mode architecture enables Mamba to capitalize on the parallel processing prowess of CNNs while preserving the sequential integrity inherent in RNNs. Moreover, Mamba integrates a discerning feature selection mechanism within the SSM framework, prioritizing salient input features and disregarding extraneous data."}, {"title": "C. Models for Spatial-Temporal Correlations Mining", "content": "Capturing both spatial and temporal correlations is essential for the proposed GAI framework to achieve accurate TFE. The neural network models for sequential grid structure includes convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM), simple video prediction model (SimVP), and eidetic 3D LSTM (E3DLSTM). As for sequential graph structures, the temporal graph convolutional network (T-GCN), spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN), and transformer-graph attentional sample and aggregate Neural Network (TGASA) can be used.\n1) Sequential Grid: Sequential grid data refers to a group of grid-structured data arranged in a sequential manner. ConvLSTM leverages the strengths of both CNN and LSTM, adeptly capturing spatial features via convolutional operations and managing temporal sequences with LSTM architectures. SimVP employs deformable convolutions and attention mechanisms. E3DLSTM, designed for video classification and behavior recognition, leverages a blend of 2D and 3D convolutions. Since traffic flow data in grid format resembles the structure of video data, these networks are also adept at processing gridded traffic flow data.\n2) Sequential Graph: Sequential graph data refers to a group of graph-structured data arranged in a sequential manner. T-GCN uses both GRU and GCN to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic patterns. STGCN uses gated sequential convolution and spatial graph convolution to capture the relationships among nodes in spatial-temporal graphs. TGASA combines an enhanced GraphSAGE model with the transformer to capture the spatial correlation and a transformer model to capture the temporal correlation.

Generative Decoder with Spatial-Temporal Conditions", "content": "After the spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data is encoded into a compressed latent representation, the generative decoder uses this information to generate TFE outcomes that resembles the ideal estimations. It focuses on reconstructing outputs based on latent representation conditions given by the conditional encoder. In training, the decoder learns to minimize the difference between its outputs and the ideal estimations. It can effectively interpolate missing data and correct errors in the initial estimation, leading to more accurate and high-quality estimations.\n1) Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE): The VAE typically consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The VAE's encoder compresses the inputs into the latent space, learning to represent the input data in compressed form. The goal of VAE's decoder is to have the reconstructed data be as close as possible to the original input data, thus ensuring that the latent space representation maintains critical information about the input data. For the application of TFE recovery, the VAE's decoder generates accurate TFE outcomes based on latent space conditions with spatial-temporal correlations.\n2) Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, the generator learns to produce output from a given input that is indistinguishable from the real data, while the discriminator acts as a judge and attempts to accurately distinguish between the real and fake. The training of GANs involves alternating between optimizing the discriminator and the generator, where the generator updates its weights to produce samples that are harder to classify as fake. A well-trained generator of GAN take the latent space conditions as inputs to produce accurate TFE outcomes.\n3) Denoising Diffusion Model: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) operate by gradually transforming data from a simple distribution into a complex distribution through a series of small, reversible steps. This process is modeled in two phases: the forward diffusion phase gradually converts a sample from the data distribution into random noise through a sequence of steps, and the reverse denoising process aims to learn how to revert the noisy data back to its original form. The denoising process of DDPM can be used to obtain accurate TFE outcomes with the guidance of conditions."}, {"title": "E. Lessons Learned", "content": "Based on the above discussion, we present our insights for designing the spatial-temporal conditional GAI framework for TFE from sparse PVD. The conditional encoder firstly use the inaccurate and low-quality initial estimations as inputs, and its the spatial module processes the spatial features of the traffic flow at discrete moments to encode these features into latent representations. Then, the temporal module receives the chronologically ordered sequence of these latent representations, identifies and integrates the temporal correlations among them. The output of conditional encoder is a comprehensive vector that embodies both spatial and temporal correlations, serving as the conditions for the generative decoder. By using the generative model approach, the generative decoder produce the accurate and high-quality TFE outcomes based on the given conditions."}, {"title": "V. CASE STUDY", "content": "The case study utilizes the real data sourced from the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing, handling the urban area through two distinct perspectives: grid structure and graph structure. The resolution of the grid-structured map is 80 \u00d7 80, while the graph road map has 500 road segments as nodes. Our dataset includes 6 days in 2012 [6]. The time period spans from 7:30 AM to 10:30 PM, and the time step is 1 minute. The sparse data is generated by random sampling of the vehicle driving information from the complete PVD dataset.\nTo show the feasibility of TFE from sparse PVD, we verify the proposed spatial-temporal conditional GAI framework with two different approaches based on VAE. For the convolutional retentive network (CRNet), the encoder block utilizes CNN to aggregate spatial correlation and RetNet to capture temporal correlation. Besides, the encoder of the TGASA mainly comprises GNN and transformer. Both methods are meticulously designed to capture spatio-temporal correlations inherent in traffic data, ensuring robust and accurate TFE despite data sparsity.

Fig. 6a shows the TFE recovery on a grid structure, where data-absent grids are marked in white. The initial traffic flow image derived from sparse PVD is markedly incomplete and distorted, reflecting significant losses and inaccuracies in the depiction of traffic speeds. After recovery, the TFE outcomes obtained by CRNet demonstrate substantial improvement, closely resembling the ideal estimation obtained from dense data. Fig. 6b illustrates the TFE recovery on graph structure. The road segments where no data were collected are colored in pure blue. In the initial TFE obtained from sparse PVD, numerous road segments appear in blue, and the overall color distribution differs obviously from that of ideal estimation derived from dense data. The application of TGASA to the recovery process effectively eradicates the blue segments, yielding a TFE that closely emulates the ideal estimation in the color portrayal of each road segment.\nFig. 6 shows the impact of data sparsification on TFE accuracy and the improvement of proposed GAI approaches. The box plots depict the distribution of root mean square errors (RMSE), while lines represent the average RMSE across various levels of data sparsity. As data becomes sparser, both the median and range of estimation errors increase, along with a rise in the mean error values. Specifically, for the case of 5% data sparsity, the CRNet reduces the RMSE from 16.09 km/h of initial estimation to 9.02 km/h, while the TGASA reduces the RMSE from 12.01 km/h of initial estimation to 3.87 km/h. Overall, the proposed spatial-temporal GAI framework with the designed neural network demonstrates substantial effectiveness in error recovery, showing marked improvements especially as data becomes sparser.

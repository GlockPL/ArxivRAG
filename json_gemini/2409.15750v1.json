Furthermore, GenAI has strong capabilities in data modeling and analysis, which enhances Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV) applications in various aspects. In this paper, we investigate and survey applications of GenAI in the IoEV. Specifically, we categorize GenAI for IoEV into four different layers namely, EV's battery layer, individual electric vehicle (EV) layer, smart grid with EV layer, and security layer. We first introduce various GenAI techniques used in each layer of IoEV applications. Subsequently, public datasets available for training the GenAI models are summarized. Finally, we provide recommendations for future directions. This survey not only categorizes the applications of GenAI in IoEV across different layers but also serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by highlighting the design and implementation challenges within each layer. Furthermore, it provides a roadmap for future research directions, enabling the development of more robust and efficient IoEV systems through the integration of advanced GenAI techniques.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "ELECTRIC mobility is the future. This is evidenced by the visions and policies of different nations and companies for achieving sustainable mobility. Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity rapidly. In the US, the sales of EV reached 1.2 million just in one quarter in 2023, with nearly 8% market share [1]. The numbers are even bigger in China. In 2023, EV's market share was 34% [2]. The trend is not much different in other nations, e.g., the sales of traditional cars with internal combustion engines (ICEs) will be phased out by 2030 and 100% cars will be clean energy based after 2040 in Singapore. Altogether, the global market of EVs reached 392.4 billion USD in 2023 with a predicted compound annual growth rate of 13.9% from 2024 to 2032 [3]. With more and more EVs on the road, they naturally form a IoEV [4]. It shares a similar spectrum of technologies to Internet of things (IoT) and offers new features such as connectivity, grid services, predictive maintenance, and traffic management. IoEV could be regarded as a specialized subset of IoT where EVs, their charging infrastructure, and smart grid interact seamlessly [5]. This creates a network of interconnected devices/systems, leading to various applications, e.g., EV routing problem in IoEV [6], smart EV charging station scheduling [7], blockchain-based EV's battery life prediction [8], and blockchain-based bidirectional energy trading between EVs and charging stations [9].\nSame as most new technologies, EV and IoEV have their problems and challenges. Making electricity the main source of power brings constraints related to electricity at the same time. The electricity is stored in batteries, which have charging speed and capacity limits, can degrade over time, and may catch fire occasionally. Those constraints affect EV operations in various aspects, e.g., charging scheduling and battery health monitoring. Furthermore, the impact goes beyond individual EV for IoEV with increased coordination and intelligence demand. One impact is on the power grid, where a significant amount of new electricity load from EVs shall not stress the grid much and hurt the grid's stability. This requires grid-level intelligence such as supply-demand forecasting and matching with the support of IoEV scheduling and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services.\nThe problems and challenges have drawn attention from the research communities and industries. Existing efforts can be clustered into application level and technology level. The counterparts of EV and IoEV are traditional cars with ICEs. IoEV is a subset of Internet of vehicle (IoV) [10], with high"}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "In this section, we introduce the concept of EV charging system, and the basics of GenAI models.\nGenAI is proposed based on traditional ML, which are discriminative models that learn the probability distribution $p(y|x)$ in Bayes' theorem for input $x$ and output $y$. The discriminative models categorize the data space into different classes by learning the decision boundaries. They often focus on distinguishing between different classes or outcomes. In the context of computer vision applications, the discriminative models are incapable of processing unknown inputs and it is required to provide label distributions for every image. As such, traditional ML models are mainly used for classification, regression, clustering, etc.\nGenAIs are different from traditional ML and they learn the probability distribution of data $p(x)$ for unconditional generative models or $p(x|y)$ for conditional generative models. This allows GenAIs to understand the underlying data distribution and generate new samples from the distribution. The generated data/contents could be statistically similar to the input data and the similarity is useful for data augmentation, simulation, and creative tasks. Overall, the generative nature of GenAI is useful for developing more dynamic and innovative solutions across various domains."}, {"title": "III.

CONCLUSIONS", "content": "In this survey, we explored the applications of GenAI in the IoEV from various perspectives. We grouped relevant applications across four different layers: EV's battery layer, individual EV layer, smart grid with EV layer, and security layer. We concluded that these applications primarily utilize GenAI's capabilities in data feature extraction, enhancement, and generation. The characteristics of GenAI make it ideal for data augmentation. Hence, research works in the first three layers all used GenAI for this purpose. At layer 1, GenAIs including GAN, GDM, VAE, and Transformer were introduced for anomaly detection, as well as SoC and SoH estimations of the EV's battery. At layer 2, GAN and Transformer were discussed for EV charging behaviors and loads as well as the optimal EV routing problem. At layer 3, GAN, VAE, and Transformer are the main techniques currently employed for EV charging load forecasting/charging scenarios generation, and LLMs for the analysis of EV charging reviews. At layer 4, GAN and AE were often applied for the detection and generation of attacks that may threaten the systems across layers 1 to 3. Subsequently, we summarized the publicly available dataset and the possible further research directions for GenAI's applications in each layer of IoEV. In conclusion, this survey highlights the essential role of GenAI in IoEV applications and underscores the urgent need for further exploration of its applications."}]}

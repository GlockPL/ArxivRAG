Despite their widespread adoption, traditional VAs often struggle with processing complex commands and providing accurate responses. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude provide solutions to overcome these limitations and promise a new era of Intelligent Assistants (IAs) that are capable of interpreting intricate contexts and delivering more satisfactory responses.\nThe popular trend of IAs reflects a growing demand for automation in both professional and personal spheres. These advanced assistants are designed to navigate the complexities of various scenarios, from corporate environments to household tasks, offering a seamless interaction experience. Most IAs are implemented on smartphones, including AutoDroid [1], GptVoiceTasker [2], and EdgeMoE [3]. AutoDroid integrates LLMs for task automation on Android devices, enhancing task execution without manual input by combining app-specific insights with LLMs' general knowledge.

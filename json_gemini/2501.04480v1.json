Introduction", "content": "Traditional logistics usually face high transportation costs and lack of transparency in information flow, problems such as loss of goods during transportation and delivery delays, and in remote areas, traditional logistics methods are difficult to reach. Meta-universe is the concept of a virtual world where the exchange of virtual goods and services becomes possible, and drone logistics can provide real-time delivery of virtual goods and services in the meta-universe through fast and efficient distribution. This enables users to have a more realistic and immediate experience in the virtual environment, enhancing the interactivity and attractiveness of the metaverse. Blockchain technology ensures the security and traceability of transactions in the metaverse. By recording the ownership, transaction history and authenticity verification of virtual goods on the blockchain, users can have more trust in the transactions and interactions in the meta-universe, and the integration of these three [1] will further promote the interaction between the virtual and physical worlds and provide users with a richer and safer virtual experience, which will jointly promote the development of logistics, transaction"}, {"title": "2.

Otherwise, the shortage of resources will lead to the inability to synchronize the update of the meta-universe, which will reduce the user's immersive experience and the performance of the meta-universe, in order to solve this problem, in this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem during the construction of the meta-universe. In addition, a new approach of quantum reinforcement learning is proposed to solve this problem. Consider going for image capturing using a UAV and then choosing the assignment task of the base station according to the specific environment. In this paper, a base station is used for image updating and optimization, interacting with virtual users and updating logistics-related information in real time, through which synchronous updating of the virtual and physical worlds can be ensured, enabling UAVs to better adapt to new virtual environments. In order to ensure the continuity and efficiency of this process, we focus on the resource allocation problem to effectively realize the limited resources in the real world, so that the virtual world is frequently synchronized with the real world. Logistics resources are characterized by heterogeneity, diversity, dynamics and complexity, which are difficult to be expressed uniformly. Existing web service related standards (XML/SOAP/WSDL/OWL) cannot be directly used to encapsulate logistics resource information because the meaning and usage of logistics services are different from traditional web services.Therefore, resource representation and service encapsulation in logistics centers are mainly concerned with how to achieve the organization and representation of resources, and the encapsulation and publication of services (as shown in Figure 1)[18]"}, {"title": "2.2 Semantic Communication Mechanisms in the Metaverse", "content": "The semantic communication mechanism transmits by filtering the transmission of relevant information and utilizes neural networks to encode and decode semantic information for real-time information collection and communication in order to construct and maintain virtual environments in the meta-universe. For example, a semantic communication system has been proposed for transmitting sensory information from the physical world to the virtual world [19], which extracts semantic features of human activities from sensory information and transmits these features to a receiver. In addition to reduce the communication resources in videoconferencing, [19]proposed the use of key nodes to represent the action taking place instead of video. The receiver can then update the speaker's facial expression based on the received keypoints. The rich relationships of objects between images represented by scene graphs can be used to construct and update meta-universes[20]. Scenario graph generation plays an important role in this paper and enables the extraction of key information in a compact form, which allows for latency reduction during data transmission, which is important for real-time updating of meta-universe services. In [21], It is described that desired images can be generated by obtaining relationships between various information in the scene graph, and adding more objects and relationships to the scene graph can improve the accuracy of the generated images.

The importance of blockchain in the initialization of meta-universes in governmental and economic sectors is discussed in [23], and possible uses of blockchain in the connection of virtual reality objects are specified. The integration of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to make virtual worlds in the metaverse more realistic and dynamic is presented in [24], discussing the potential connection between metaverse and blockchain. The convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence was detailed in [25], It focuses on how to perform complex data analysis and pattern recognition to ensure the security and integrity of user data. there are various studies [26] that mention blockchain as a necessary condition for metaverse. In this paper, a secure authentication scheme is designed on Web 3.0 using blockchain technology to ensure access control and data integrity through logging transactions Web 3.0 servers securely collect data from both real and virtual worlds.\nIn the drone blockchain system, each drone node builds a blockchain network through inter-node communication and data exchange. The trustworthiness of the nodes and the communication environment is critical to the blockchain network. Otherwise, malicious nodes or insecure communication environments may introduce unreliable data into the blockchain system. Dynamic security assessment is mainly to accommodate the mobility of UAV nodes. Blockchain technology has significant value in data transfer between UAVs. Blockchain-based data transfer between drones can verify the trustworthiness of the data source based on the consensus mechanism, thus realizing distributed data sharing. The decentralization, tamperability, transparency, security, and programmability of blockchain technology can enable data to be shared securely across the UAV network. When resources are limited, hierarchical blockchain technology allows for continuous updating of environmental security assessments. At the same time, the movement of nodes in the network poses the problem of node trust management. For example, when nodes move between clusters, the cluster head needs to determine the trustworthiness of the newly joined nodes and reassess their trust. These characteristics dictate that static security assessments cannot accommodate the mobility of UAV clusters, and dynamic security assessments need to be used to update the security status of UAV networks in a timely manner."}, {"title": "3.Model", "content": "The layered architecture for constructing the drone delivery scheme in the meta-universe includes several interconnected layers: the physical layer, the semantic communication layer, the physical resource layer, the blockchain layer, and the meta-universe layer (shown in Figure 3). After obtaining transaction information and transaction images from the physical world, the UAV uploads them to the physical resource layer and uses quantum reinforcement learning techniques to generate multiple trusted training tuples [27] to ensure seamless connectivity with the virtual environment.The base station is responsible for rendering and optimizing the images from the physical world and interacting with the virtual service provider to achieve synchronous updates between the two worlds. The semantic communication layer generates text from the collected scene graphs and then encodes and decodes the textual information using LSTM sequences to realize the delivery of logistics information.

First, the UAV observes the current environment and acquires a local state. This state can be any observable feature or parameter based on the environment information. The classical actions are converted into quantum actions, which is achieved by a set of orthogonal basis vectors. These quantum actions are called feature actions and they are represented using quantum bits. The starting process is to convert the environment state and action state in reinforcement learning into quantum states, and the classical actions into quantum actions, which are encoded by orthogonal basis vectors[27]. The Grover iteration process is performed, which is a quantum algorithm for searching for optimal solutions in the quantum state space.The Grover iteration consists of a unitary transformation U that acts on all N elementary quantum bits simultaneously and updates the magnitude corresponding to each quantum action. In the Grover iteration, the sign of the target action is flipped and labeled. Perform Grover iterations or other quantum algorithms that transform the quantum state and update the quantum magnitude to reflect the different actions.

This objective function aims to find strategies that maximize the sum of these three components. And speed up the adaptation to the new environment. According to [28] the objective function is expressed as:\n$\\max p_u{Exploitation + Exploration + Extension} (1)$\nExploitation denotes the behavior of choosing what the base station believes produces the highest return based on the current strategy, and Exploration denotes the ability to intelligently explore drone actions and gather more information about the environment, learning from the collective intelligence as the drone encounters new environments to improve the current operational decisions.Extension refers to the ability of the drone to share intelligence, adapting to new logistical transaction scenarios to improve long-term transaction performance.

By considering these factors, the reward function encourages the UAV to select the base station that maximizes its long-term gain. In simulation experiments, the reward function is used to evaluate the performance of different strategies (e.g., the proposed quantum collective reinforcement learning method, PPO algorithm, SAC algorithm), and determine which method is more effective by comparing the rewards under different strategies.\nSecondly, this paper establishes a reward form for semantic communication systems as well, The proposed problem requires semantic information optimization which is used to ensure the similarity of semantic information, this paper uses 0(m, m)\u2192R+ to denote a specific metric.

The purpose of the channel coder is to convert the coded data into a form suitable for transmission over a particular communication channel. This may include adding redundant data to improve the robustness of the transmission. The received encoded information is decoded using the decoder to display the uploaded scene graph and construct the new virtual environment. The channel decoder needs to be able to handle channel noise. Finally, the receiver uses the decoded data to reconstruct the scene graph (shown in Figure 4). The transmitter extracts features $O_{ma}$ and $O_{mb}$ from the input image and extracts $r_{m, ab}$.

Existing measures of AI occupational exposure largely focus on AI's theoretical potential to substitute or complement human labour on the basis of technical feasibility, providing limited insight into actual adoption and offering inadequate guidance for policymakers.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index a novel metric based on occupational descriptions from O*NET and AI applications developed by startups funded by the Y Combinator accelerator. Our findings indicate that while high-skilled professions are theoretically highly exposed according to conventional metrics, they are heterogeneously targeted by startups. Roles involving routine organizational tasks such as data analysis and office management-display significant exposure, while occupations involving tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to ethical or high-stakes, more than feasibility, considerations such as judges or surgeons- present lower AISE scores. Moreover, geographically, AI exposure is concentrated in knowledge-intensive metropolitan areas like San Francisco and Seattle, while service-oriented sectors exhibit greater exposure compared to agriculture and construction. By focusing on venture-backed AI applications, our approach offers a nuanced perspective on how AI is reshaping the labour market. It challenges the conventional assumption that high-skilled jobs uniformly face high AI risks, highlighting instead the role of today's AI players' societal desirability-driven and market-oriented choices as critical determinants of AI exposure. Contrary to fears of widespread job displacement, our findings suggest that AI adoption will be gradual and shaped by social factors as much as by the technical feasibility of AI applications. This framework provides a dynamic, forward-looking tool for policymakers and stakeholders to monitor Al's evolving impact and navigate the changing labour landscape.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The public and scholarly debate on the employment effects of the new wave of AI developments, especially since the deployment of generative AI, is highly polarized and presents contrasting views on their potential risks and benefits. While some fear a jobless future (Marken 2023), others foresee job creation and complementarity between human and automated tasks, potentially leading to a productivity boost due to AI (Georgieff & Hyee 2021). Beyond the differing views, there is consensus among academics and policymakers that the current wave of artificial intelligence fun-damentally differs from previous technological shifts (Staneva & Elliott 2023), distinguished by its unprecedented ability to mimic human reasoning and creativity across a wide range of applications.\nThis unique capability to perform complex, non-routine tasks - exemplified by large language mod-els like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude - coupled with its rapid pace of adoption and improvement (Jung & Desikan 2024) positions AI as potentially one of the \"most significant general-purpose technology of our era\" (Brynjolfsson & Mcafee 2017), with far-reaching implications for the economy at large, and heterogeneous effects across jobs, sectors, and countries (Acemoglu 2021, Georgieff & Hyee 2021).\nAs AI applications continue to emerge, extensive research has already focused on its impact on the labour market. There is growing evidence that AI is reshaping labour demand (Acemoglu &\nRestrepo 2020a, Acemoglu et al. 2022, Albanesi et al. 2023, Fleming 2019), yet the overall employ-ment effects remain unclear due to the large uncertainty on how these rapidly evolving technical developments will be adopted and deployed (Acemoglu et al. 2022, Acemoglu 2021, Autor 2022). Empirical findings vary widely, from low disruption (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell 2017, Brynjolfsson et al. 2018, Gmyrek et al. 2023) to high displacement potential (Eloundou et al. 2024). Some stud-ies show AI having complementary effects (Gmyrek et al. 2023, Ellingrud et al. 2023) and driving productivity gains, particularly in high-skilled occupations (Brynjolfsson 2023, Noy & Zhang 2023, Peng et al. 2023), while others remain inconclusive about whether AI leads to complementarity or substitution (Felten et al. 2019, 2021). Concerns have emerged about AI adoption outpacing the labour market's ability to adapt (Brynjolfsson et al. 2018), the quality of new jobs created (Autor 2022, Green et al. 2023), and AI uneven impact across sectors and regions (Frank et al. 2019). Ace-moglu et al. (2023) and Autor et al. (2022) argue that AI's emphasis on automation, rather than augmenting human tasks, risks further stagnating productivity, wages, and labour demand, while deepening income inequality. To mitigate these risks, they advocate for a human complementarity approach supported by an appropriate set of government policies (Autor et al. 2022, Autor 2024, Acemoglu et al. 2023). Additionally, the diminished worker voice due to AI powered monitoring and surveillance, the dominance of private actors in the AI race, and the absence of clear legislative frameworks have sparked broader concerns about AI societal impact (Acemoglu 2021, Autor 2022, Staccioli et al. 2024).\nWhile the debate on AI labour market and societal impact lacks consensus, the literature broadly agrees that, unlike previous ICT-based technological changes, AI exposure is highest among high-skilled, white-collar workers (Eloundou et al. 2024, Felten et al. 2019, Webb 2019). AI in fact primarily targets clerical work but affects both routine and non-routine cognitive tasks, whereas manual, operational, and technical tasks are comparatively less exposed.\nOne of the primary methodological and conceptual challenges for understanding the impact of AI on labour markets is the empirical identification of occupational AI exposure. Building on the task framework pioneered by Autor et al. (2003), several recent approaches estimate the average AI exposure of occupations based on the overlap between AI capabilities and occupational tasks or abilities (Brynjolfsson et al. 2018, Eloundou et al. 2024, Frey & Osborne 2017, Felten et al. 2019, 2021, 2023, Mart\u00ednez-Plumed et al. 2020, Tolan et al. 2021). Among these, the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) index proposed by Felten et al. 2019, 2021 is becoming a standard in the literature and serves as a benchmark for our analysis see the Methods section for more details on its construction. More recently, AI-assisted approaches have emerged, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess occupational exposure, as demonstrated by Gmyrek et al. (2023), who estimate task-level scores of occupational exposure to AI using ChatGPT-4, and Eloundou et al. (2024), who combine expert opinions with ChatGPT-4 classifications to quantify the impact of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) on the US labour market. Finally, Webb (2020), Meindl et al. (2021), Sousa & Sytsma (2023) have proposed patent-based methods, employing NLP techniques to analyze AI patent texts' similarity directly to occupational descriptions.\nIn these works, AI exposure is generally determined by three main steps: (i) selection of a set of relevant AI applications \u2013 such as language modeling or image recognition \u2013 either arbitrarily or based on AI benchmarks\u00b9; (ii) assessment of the potential for task or ability substitution in various occupations using information via expert judgment, crowd-sourcing platforms, or natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and leveraging detailed descriptions from the O*NET occupational database; (iii) definition of the occupational AI exposure index as the share of the occupation's bundle of tasks/abilities that the AI applications are capable to substitute for.\nAll these efforts, while extremely valuable, share some shortcomings. First, relying on expert or crowd-sourced evaluations of AI capabilities may lead to non-reproducible, subjective estimates. This is partially mitigated by the approaches relying on AI patents, which are more quantitative and less subjective. However, a significant disadvantage is that patents may not cover most AI applications since, as many other software advancements, they are not often patented, and patents may not allow to map in most recent advancements as usually there is a lag between the filing date and the time at which they are observed in patent databases (Rudyk et al. 2015). Second, all these indices, irrespective of how they are built, inherently measure the potential AI exposure, not actual adoption within firms and industries (Guarascio et al. 2023, Svanberg et al. 2024). With the exception of Svanberg et al. (2024), who take into account the economic attractiveness of automating computer vision, none of these approaches directly include information on the technical feasibility of AI implementation, the economic viability, and the social desirability of adopting AI systems. This may limit their predictive accuracy and usefulness for guiding policy planning. In fact, as the actual diffusion of AI is still in its early stages, no strong evidence of labour substitution seems to emerge for occupations considered most exposed to AI according to existing indices (Albanesi et al. 2023, Barbieri et al. 2020, Green et al. 2023, Mondolo 2022).\nTo overcome the potential nature of AI exposure metrics and building on the existing approaches in the literature, especially on those relying on LLMs such as Eloundou et al. (2024) and (Gmyrek et al. 2023), in the present paper we propose a novel occupational AI exposure index, the Occupational AI Startup Exposure (AISE ). AISE is aimed at measuring the near-future, actual exposure of occupations by proxying AI innovations with AI applications developed by the startups funded by Y Combinator Management, a US-based venture capital firm and startup accelerator.\u00b2 In practice, AISE assigns an exposure score to each occupation by leveraging Meta's Llama3 state-of-the-art open-weight large language model to asses the similarity between O*NET job descriptions and the descriptions of the AI applications developed by Y Combinator-funded startups - available from Y Combinator website.\nAccording to AISE, the occupations displaying highest exposure are General office clerks, Data scientists, Computer and information systems managers, and Market research analysts and marketing specialists. These roles typically involve programming, information processing, or organizational tasks that are increasingly targeted by AI startups. In contrast, Athletes and sports competitors, Magistrate judges, and Pediatric surgeons present low AISE scores. These occupations have more diversified skill sets and often involve tasks that are less amenable to AI automation due to phys-ical, ethical, or high-stakes considerations. Overall, and in agreement with the \"reverse skill-bias\" predicted by Acemoglu Acemoglu & Restrepo (2020b), our findings indicate that high-skilled, high-education jobs display the highest AI exposure, albeit with some interesting detours from standard exposure indices.\nWhen comparing our exposure rankings with that of Felten et al. (2021)'s AIOE, we observe that jobs with both low AIOE and Occupational AISE tend to be composed primarily of manual tasks. As AIOE increases, we detect a heterogeneous pattern of AISE, with several occupations displaying lower exposure from our startup-based index compared to the ability-based AIOE. Interestingly, occupations typically requiring a master's degree or higher, significant experience, and skills with high importance scores are concentrated in the area of low AISE but high AIOE. This heterogeneity can help disentangle jobs with similar abilities but different levels of actual AI exposure. It suggests that despite the theoretical exposure to AI, many high-skill, high-education roles are not currently impacted by AI according to our startup-based measure. This highlights that the necessity for advanced skills and the high-stakes associated with errors in these roles make AI integration less straightforward, even when there is theoretical potential for AI involvement.\nWhile we remain silent on the net labour market effects of AI and on whether AI acts as a complement or a substitute to human labour, we propose a geographical and a sectoral projection of AISE. Geographically, we observe that knowledge-intensive US metropolitan areas with expanding digital economies and tech industries - such as San Jose, San Francisco, Austin, and Seattle - show higher average AISE. In contrast, the Midwest shows lower exposure, likely due to its reliance on manufacturing and agriculture. At the sector-level, we find that service-oriented industries requiring higher levels of information processing and education tend to have greater AI exposure. In contrast, sectors like Educational Services and Health Care, which also demand high education levels but involve many high-stakes jobs, exhibit lower exposure. Unsurprisingly, sectors such as construction and agriculture are less frequently targeted by AI startups.\nFinally, in the supplementary information (SI), we present a preliminary result demonstrating how the same methodology used for the AISE can be applied to create a Robotic Startup Exposure (RSE) index. This index links descriptions of the products and services developed by robotics-focused AI startups to job descriptions. Our analysis shows that many occupations with low AISE scores have high RSE scores, particularly lower-skill jobs that involve more physical abilities. Interestingly, we also find that occupations with high AISE scores tend to also have high RSE scores. These findings suggest that many robotics startups are integrating AI into their products, and the joint action of AI and robotics may open the way for much more pervasive job disruption, not only in manufacturing occupations but across all occupations. In this way, our approach illustrate how one can study the impact of the integration of AI and robotics, which, unlike the impact of robotics and automation alone (Acemoglu & Restrepo 2018, Autor & Salomons 2018, Ant\u00f3n et al. 2022), remains under-explored in the literature.\nThe novel measures of AI and AI-powered robotic exposure we propose are grounded in actual investments in AI and provide a more realistic assessment of job exposure. Our findings in fact mitigate the high-skills catastrophe envisioned by other approaches, even though they suggest that the potential impact of AI robotics may be highly pervasive. Indeed, unlike the abstract nature of AI capabilities found in patent or benchmark datasets, AI startups are funded by venture capital because they propose tangible solutions related to the performance of specific tasks, prioritizing economic viability over potential technological feasibility and capturing societal interest, trust, and the willingness to integrate AI into occupations (Glikson & Woolley 2020). Moreover, a key advan-tage of our methodology in constructing the AISE index is its full reproducibility, as it leverages an open-weight LLM that can be freely and locally executed. AISE can be easily updated as new AI startups are financed by Y Combinator or other venture capital firms, enabling near real-time tracking of AI investments to inform effective policy development.\nIn future works, we plan to expand AISE and its variants to provide more comprehensive insights into AI's impact on the labour market. This includes evaluating the effects of AI on employment patterns, wage dynamics, and income distribution across different sectors and regions, particularly in the US and Europe. We also aim to explore how AI adoption shapes occupational structures over time, contributing to a deeper understanding of its broader economic and societal implications."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "To quantify the AI Startup Exposure (AISE ) of occupations, geographical areas and industries we rely on two textual data sources, O*NET and the description of the startup funded by the accelerator Y Combinator, and link new AI developments with occupational characteristics using Meta state-of-the-art LLM Llama 3.\nIn practice, we feed Llama 3 with the textual descriptions of (i) over 1000 SOC occupations provided by O*NET\u00b3 and (ii) almost 1000 AI-tagged startups funded by Y Combinator (see the Methods section), and exploit the LLM's linguistic abstraction capabilities to determine whether, for each startup-occupation pair, the startup's AI application can substitute one or more of the essential tasks mentioned in the O*NET short occupational descriptions. We refer to the Methods section for the definition of essential tasks and more details on the empirical strategy implementation.\nWe thus define our Occupational AI Startup Exposure (Occupational AISE) for each job as the normalized number of startups developing AI applications identified by the LLM as substitutes for one or more of the essential tasks present in the job's O*NET short description.\nOur exposure is based on the interest of the startup ecosystem in developing AI applications aimed at partially or fully automating a job, it therefore indirectly captures the AI application feasi-bility, cost, and attractiveness assessments by both the single startup and Y Combinator (Svanberg et al. 2024). Therefore, AISE remains neutral regarding whether AI will complement or substitute human L'abiura, it instead reflects the potential transformation of work driven by AI considering the automation of critical job tasks that, if replaced, would significantly modify the job. In fact, by focusing on essential tasks, as described in O*NET's short descriptions, the index highlights how automating these tasks could alter the nature of the job and the skill-set required to perform it."}, {"title": "AI Occupational exposure", "content": "To provide an initial impression of where the AI startup market is headed and which insights Occupational AISE can provide, it is interesting to look in detail at which jobs are most and least exposed to AI (an extended list of the most and least exposed occupations according to our index is presented in the SI Tables 1 and 2). The job with the highest Occupational AISE is General office clerks, described by O*NET as requiring Knowledge of office systems and procedures and which tasks include a Maintain and update filing, inventory, mailing, and database systems, either manually or using a computer. and Compile, copy, sort, and file records of office activities, business transactions, and other activities. In view of the rapid advancement of generative AI, which increasingly simplifies and automates the generation and processing of any format of information (text, audio, video), it is not difficult to imagine that a large portion of such tasks mentioned is highly substitutable by startups developing LLMs or multi AI agents systems. Among the AI applications proposed by startups funded by Y Combinator and classified by Llama 3 as potential substitutes for at least one of the essential tasks of a general office clerk, we mention two illustrative cases. The startup Nowadays develops an AI-powered event planning copilot capable of organizing large-scale corporate events e.g., it can contact venues, negotiate, and handle all administrative tasks; the startup Quickchat AI develops a platform to build multilingual AI assistants powered by generative AI models such as GPT that can perform conversational tasks - e.g., answering phone calls or processing information for organizational tasks.\nOther jobs with high Occupational AISE include Data scientists, Computer and information systems managersand Market research analysts and marketing specialists. According to O*NET, all these jobs require tasks related to programming and information processing or organizational and planning tasks which by the same token are increasingly targeted by AI-based startups.\nThe analysis of the jobs least exposed to AI, as determined by Occupational AISE, is less straightforward because these occupations present more diversified skill-sets and educational/training requirements. To illustrate, let us consider three jobs with low Occupational AISE scores: Athletes and sports competitors, Magistrate judges, and Pediatric surgeons. Athletes, while benefiting from AI tools for performance monitoring and injury prevention, primarily engage in tasks that rely on human physical abilities and their societal value lies intrinsically in their ability to push human limits while remaining human.\nJudges, in contrast, perform tasks requiring advanced cognitive skills, such as information pro-cessing and decision-making in complex contexts tasks that in principle generative AI could already perform. However, the high-stakes and ethically charged nature of judicial work poses sig-nificant barriers to AI adoption in this field. This challenge is compounded by the ongoing heated debate about the role of AI in legal and judicial contexts and the ethical implications and introduction of undesired biases in the increasing use of AI in the US criminal justice system Surden (2019), Yamane (2020), Gordon (2021), highlighting the critical role of the \"human factor\" and personal accountability in judges' rulings, all factors contributing to a limitation to automation, beyond a mere assessment of technological feasibility.\nFinally, pediatricians, like other medical professionals with low Occupational AISE scores, re-quire a combination of manual skills (such as handling instruments or treating patients), cognitive abilities, and social skills. Although some essential tasks, like symptom-based diagnosis, could be and in some contexts are already automated with AI Malik et al. (2019), Rajpurkar et al. (2022), the medical field's sensitivity to errors due to their potentially dramatic consequences and the ac-companying legal and ethical implications - discourages AI startups from targeting the substitution of critical medical tasks.\nThese examples demonstrate how our measure of Occupational AISE effectively captures not only the overlap between the human and AI capabilities in performing specific tasks but also the societal attractiveness of such exposure (Glikson & Woolley 2020). This insight is made possible by the use of data based on concrete attempts and investments, reflecting both the potential and the limitations of AI integration across various professions: AI exposure is not solely driven by technical feasibility, multiple other societal constraints can accelerate, slow down, or even halt AI relevance."}, {"title": "AISE and AIOE", "content": "To externally validate our measure of AI exposure and assess the differences of our startup-based view of the role of new AI developments in the world of work, we compare the Occupational AISE with one of the most used exposure metric in the literature, the AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) index introduced by Felten et al. (2021). AIOE is built by first quantifying the AI exposure of single O*NET abilities \u2013 e.g., Deductive reasoning or Negotiation \u2013 through a crowd-sourced survey. Second, by considering an occupation as the bundle of abilities it uses, an occupation AI exposure is measured as the average exposure of the required abilities - for more details on AIOE and its construction see Section. Therefore, since abilities are personal attributes that can be associated to different occupations, relying on this intermediate layer, AIOE does not capture a job actual AI exposure but its theoretical or potential exposure based on current technological feasibility (Tolan et al. 2020, Staneva & Elliott 2023).\nFigure 1 shows the AISE vs AIOE relationship for each SOC occupation, color-coded according to O*NET five Job Zones. A Job Zone is an occupations grouping reflecting the level of education, training, and experience requirements: in Job Zone 1 occupations require little or no preparation and rely mainly on manual skills, whereas occupations in Job Zone 5 require extensive preparation and a larger share of cognitive skills.\nThe first message we gather from Figure 1 is that AIOE and AISE describe a coherent picture of AI exposure despite being based on very different methodologies. In the bottom left portion of the plot, where both AIOE and AISE are low, we find jobs composed mainly by manual tasks, that have been identified in the literature as less subject to AI substitution Felten et al. (2019) and are thus less targeted by AI-based startups. In constrast, as AIOE increases, we detect a heterogeneous pattern of Occupational AISE, with several occupations displaying a lower exposure from the startup-based index with respect to AIOE.\nThese differences are informative about the underlying factors the two exposure metrics capture. In fact, while we learn from AIOE that some of the abilities used within a specific occupation are potentially exposed to a set of AI functions, this does not provide us information on the profitability, desirability and actual development of an AI application geared at substituting or complementing human labour. In contrast, Occupational AISE takes into account already implemented, state-of-the-art AI developments, thus shedding light on a different dimension of exposure. To illustrate, in O*NET Database administrators and Lawyers require similar sets of primarily cognitive abilities including, e.g., Deductive and Inductive Reasoning or Information Ordering. Therefore, the two jobs present nearly identical AI potential exposure \u2013 with AIOE scores above 6.1. However, according to our analysis, these two occupations are subject to very different degrees of exposure, with Database administrators and Lawyers that display an Occupational AISE of about 0.8 and 0.05, respectively (AISE varies between 0 and 1). Needless to say, Lawyers and Database administrations differ for several reasons, especially linked to the societal implications of their professions. As discussed above, automating the judicial system presents both technical and ethical challenges. In contrast, there are fewer constraints on the administration of databases, a textbook example of how AI-powered tools can automate routine tasks, improve performance, potentially complementing or fully substituting human labour. Indeed, in the region of high AIOE and low Occupational AISE, there are jobs like high school teachers, judges, and marriage counsellors. Of course, AI can complement and support some secondary tasks of these jobs. However, our findings suggest that there is still no significant interest or trust in placing the essential tasks of these professions entirely in the hands of AI.\nTo investigate the underlying factors contributing to AI exposure, in Figure 1, where each dot represents an occupation, we color occupations according to their respective Job Zones. In agreement with the literature on the impact of AI on the labour market, high-skilled, high-education jobs are considered the most at risk Webb (2019), Acemoglu (2021), Acemoglu et al. (2022). As can be appreciated in Figure 1, where higher AIOE maps into higher education and training, according to AIOE AI will disproportionately affect cognitive tasks and occupations relying mainly on problem-solving, logical reasoning, and information processing capabilities (Felten et al. 2021). However, our Occupational AISE reveals an alternative scenario: occupations in Job Zone 5, which typically require a master's degree or higher and significant experience, are concentrated in the bottom right of the scatter plot - with low Occupational AISE and high AIOE. This indicates that despite their potential exposure to AI, as signalled by AIOE, most of these high-education and high-experience roles are not currently targeted by AI.\nThe separation of jobs into homogeneous intervals of AIOE highlights how the level of education and experience in an occupation relates to the expected Occupational AISE, as shown in Figure 2. We divide three regions of AIOE exposure levels, in order to illustrate the key differences between AISE and AIOE. Occupations with lower AIOE aggregate in the bottom left of the AISE -AIO\u0415 diagram, exhibiting uniform and low AISE, as shown in panel (a) of Figure 2.\nIn contrast, as the theoretical exposure mapped by AIOE increases, the most exposed jobs display lower education requirements, as indicated by their Job Zone. While our analysis confirms that occupations with high potential AIOE exposure are more likely to be affected by AI, Panel (c) of Figure 2 reinforces our previous argument that technological feasibility is not the sole factor driving the AI-based startup market. Even with a comparable level of theoretical exposure, jobs requiring more specialized skills and education are less likely to see AI replacing humans in their essential tasks. Highly specialised professions in higher Job Zones necessitate a combination of advanced education, extensive experience, and strong cognitive, social, and human skills to handle uncertainties, such as those faced by judges or medical doctors. Complex skill sets and higher professional capacity to handle uncertainty, a trait often required in higher Job Zones, makes the practical integration of AI less straightforward, even when technically feasible.\nWhile in O*NET it is impossible to discern occupations requiring the capacity to handle uncer-tainty and complex tasks with ethical or health-related implications, we can have a better under-standing of the differences between jobs with high AIOE by analyzing in detail their required skills. O*NET associates a set of skills to each occupation, with an importance score ranging from 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important). Crucial skills, hereafter defined as the set of skills with importance greater than 4, represent core competencies and are good indicators of an occupation's startup exposure. Figure 3 presents a bar plot comparing the percentage of jobs with crucial skills between two areas of the scatter plot in Figure 1: the upper-right (top-c) region, corresponding to occupations with high values for both AIOE and Occupational AISE (blue bars) and the lower-right (bottom-c) region, containing jobs with high AIOE but low Occupational AISE (red bars). The first noticeable observation is that the likelihood of requiring skills with an importance score greater than 4 is significantly higher in the bottom-c region of the AIOE-Occupational AISE diagram. This applies even to skills that generative AI can already manage successfully, such as reading compre-hension and writing, and indicates that jobs in this region demand more experience or training, and errors in performing some of their associated tasks may be very costly.\nThe second observation is that, in the same bottom-c region, skills related to social and human domains-such as speaking, instructing, or judgment and decision making- appear more frequently. As discussed above, these skills are crucial for managing uncertainty and present challenges to AI integration, even when there is theoretical potential for AI involvement.\nIn summary, while there is theoretical potential for AI involvement across various occupations, the necessity for advanced skills and the high stakes associated with errors in certain jobs make AI integration less straightforward. This complexity underscores the importance of analyzing the specific skill sets required for each occupation to accurately understand their exposure to AI. Fur-thermore, the presence of several crucial skills significantly influences a job's exposure to AI: having many crucial skills tends to decrease Occupational AISE at fixed AIOE. The top inset of Figure 3 shows the barplot splitting the range of crucial skills into four discrete intervals for jobs with high AIOE across the entire c region, as defined in Figure 2."}, {"title": "Geographical and Sectoral AI exposure", "content": "Neither AIOE nor AISE directly measures the geographical dimension of AI exposure for the na-tional or sub-national workforce. However, the net exposure at the geographical level can be assessed by calculating the average occupation exposure at different geographical scales, by av-eraging Occupational AISE with the employment share per occupation. Figure 4 illustrates the average Occupational AISE of US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). MSAs are regions with large populations and low employment interchange with surrounding areas, thus providing a more effective representation of local labour markets than counties. A few areas exhibit high average exposure to AI according to the AISE, primarily in regions with expanding digital economies, tech industries and innovation ecosystems, such as San Jose/Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, and Boulder. Interestingly but not surprisingly, metropolitan areas in the Midwest - encompassing Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin - display the lowest exposure to AI. This lower exposure can be attributed to the region's economic reliance on manufacturing and agriculture, industries that have been slower to integrate AI technologies compared to tech hubs. In contrast, many areas in the West show high exposure levels, aligning with the region's reputation for tech innovation and startups. This geographical disparity highlights how Al's impact on the workforce is unevenly distributed, influenced by the local economic landscape and the prevalence of digital economies.\nWe can also establish a measure of AI exposure at the sector level by combining the occupational AISE across all occupations within a given industry. Similarly to the geographical exposure, we construct a sectoral AISE index by computing a weighted average of the occupational AISE, using US Bureau of Labor Statistics industry employment levels for the nineteen two-digit NAICS sectors. Figure 5 displays two-digit NAICS sectors ranked in ascending order based on sectoral AISE values. Unsurprisingly, as with ranked occupations, we find that the lowest-scoring sectors are typically those involving manual L'abiura, such as construction or agriculture. Conversely, the most exposed sectors are primarily service-oriented, requiring a high level of information processing and higher levels of education (jobs in high job zones). This means they involve workers positioned in the far-right area of the AISE-AIOE diagram (zone c in Figure 2d), indicating a heterogeneous level of exposure. Finally, however, sectors such as Educational Services and Health Care, which also require high education levels, show relatively low exposure for the same reasons mentioned earlier, as they include many jobs located in the lower-right area of the AISE-AIOE diagram."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This study introduces the AI Startup Exposure (AISE) index as a novel tool to assess the im-pact of artificial intelligence (AI) on occupations", "finding": "while existing indices of potential exposure suggest that high-skilled", "fronts": "first, to better understand how the convergence of AI and robotics could amplify technological disruption across sectors, and second, to expand the data sample beyond the current limited number of AI-robotics startups.\nA significant advantage of our exposure index is its ability to be continuously refined and ex-panded as more AI startups emerge. The index can be easily updated with larger datasets from other startup ecosystems beyond Y Combinator, providing a more comprehensive view of AI inno-vation. Additionally, combining AISE with other sources of information, such as AI patents and scientific publications, would offer an even broader and more nuanced understanding of AI's impact.\nWhile the AISE and RSE indices offer valuable insights, several limitations warrant consider-ation. The reliance on startup data introduces a bias towards innovations that are already com-mercially viable or secured venture capital backing, potentially underestimating AI developments in academia or industries that are less reliant on venture capital. Moreover, focusing on the oc-cupational dimension, our index, by design, operates the implicit assumption that occupations are homogeneous across geography and across firms. However this is not always the case, occupational heterogeneity can stem from the significant portion of AI-related tasks driven by the tacit knowl-edge embedded in firm-specific organizational practices and procedural routines (Dosi & Marengo 2015, Dosi & Virgillito 2019), or from different labour market contexts (De Marzo et al. 2023). This makes AI exposure far more complex than occupational-level analysis can reflect (Tolan et al. 2021). To address these firm-level dynamics, a more granular approach beyond occupational-level exposure is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of AI's employment effects.\nIn conclusion, this study offers a new perspective on AI's labour market implications by ground-ing its analysis in market-driven innovations rather than theoretical models. Contrary to widespread fears of imminent job displacement in high-skilled occupations, the AISE index suggests that au-tomation will target routine, economically viable tasks first, while expert-driven roles will remain relatively shielded from AI disruption at least in the short term.

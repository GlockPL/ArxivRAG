In this work, we investigate the impact of co-located pedestrians on crossing behaviour, considering cultural and situational factors. To accomplish this, a full-scale virtual reality (VR) environment was created in the CARLA simulator, enabling the identical experiment to be replicated in both Spain and Australia. Participants (N=30) attempted to cross the road at an urban crosswalk alongside other pedestrians exhibiting conservative to more daring behaviours, while an autonomous vehicle (AV) approached with different driving styles. For the analysis of interactions, we utilized questionnaires and direct measures of the moment when participants entered the lane. Our findings indicate that pedestrians tend to cross the same traffic gap together, even though reckless behaviour by the group reduces confidence and makes the situation perceived as more complex. Australian participants were willing to take fewer risks than Spanish participants, adopting more cautious behaviour when it was uncertain whether the AV would yield.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The integration of AVs into society depends on public opinion and acceptance, and there are numerous ongoing studies dedicated to exploring these aspects, along with examining cross-cultural variations and their impact [1]. Various surveys in this regard report cultural differences in drivers' trust levels and their preferences for the design of AV explanation interfaces [2], [3] or for vehicle interiors [4]. The implementation of an accepted driving style is paramount to meet user expectations of safety and comfort. In addition to uncovering significant disparities between countries in how driving styles and decisions are interpreted [5], [6], most of respondents also express a preference for more conservative AV driving behaviour compared to their own [7].\nAnother key factor in increasing the level of acceptance of AVs is to further our comprehension of their interactions with other road users, as the absence of a human driver pre-vents them from negotiating their actions in the conventional and socially compatible manner [8]. From this arises the variety of Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) modalities [9] and implicit communication strategies [10] to convey their intentions and achieve their goals in the traffic scenarios. This information allows pedestrians gain confidence in AVS by being able to anticipate their movements and thus make more conscious and safer decisions when crossing streets.\nAmong the main variables on which pedestrians base their road-crossing decisions are the implicit communication with the vehicle over the explicit (i.e., legacy behaviour) [11] and the road-crossing situation, such as signage [12], familiarity or neighbor's behaviour [13]. Even pedestrians who are not necessarily traveling together in a group can be influenced by seeing someone crossing the road and consequently modify their decision to cross. Social information plays an important role in decision-making that has also been observed to vary in the pedestrian context as a function of culture [14].\nControlled virtual reality environments have demonstrated to offer optimal safety conditions and flexibility for the study of human-AV interaction [15], [16]. In this work, we conducted an experiment on this subject for which we employed a unique framework for the insertion of real agents into the CARLA simulator [17], [18]. In it, an immersive VR interface and a full-body motion capture system allows a real pedestrian to interact with the simulation environment safely and adopting a natural locomotion style. We evaluate a form of implicit AV communication and the influence of co-located pedestrians on the user's decision making and subjective perception. For this purpose, we designed an interaction scenario in which an AV applied different braking manoeuvres as it approached a crosswalk, including occasions when it did not yield to the participant. A group of pedestrians stood at the beginning of the crosswalk and made crossing decisions together, which allowed us to answer our first research question:\n\u2022 RQ1: To what extent do the braking manoeuvre and social information influence the crossing behaviour of a pedestrian in a crosswalk?\nLeveraging the high replicability of the simulated scenar-ios at minimal cost, we conducted the study in two different countries and analyzed the results of participants residing in Spain and Australia, thereby addressing our second research questions:\n\u2022 RQ2: Does cultural background influence the crossing behaviour of a pedestrian in a crosswalk?\nAlso, data captured in the VR environment and by the mo-tion capture system can be used to train and test algorithms aimed at advancing autonomous driving technology."}, {"title": "II.

METHOD", "content": "The current study employed an immersive VR experiment to evaluate how social information, obtained from observing multiple co-located pedestrians, and the driving style of AVs influence pedestrian road crossing behaviour. A within-subject design approach was used whereby each participant was exposed to all experimental conditions to eliminate the effects of individual differences.\n1) Experiment Scenario Design: Within one of the map models provided by the CARLA simulator [31] we chose an urban crosswalk as the environment in which to conduct the VR experiment (see Fig. 1). Ambient audio was incorporated to make the VR experience more realistic, and the lighting and weather conditions were adjusted to be favorable. In this scenario, an AV drives down the street in a straight line and reaches the crosswalk when virtual pedestrians are waiting to cross from both sidewalks. The participant waits with their back to the road on one of the sidewalks and is instructed to turn around when the AV is 30 meters away and attempts to cross when deemed safe (no vegetation or other parked vehicles obstructing vision).\nAs can be seen in Fig. 2, three braking manoeuvres were designed to assess their effect on participant decision mak-ing. In the moderate manoeuvre, the AV travels comfortably at 18 km/h and applies a deceleration of -1.8 m/s\u00b2 until it stops before the crosswalk and yields to pedestrians. In the second manoeuvre, the AV circulates at 30 km/h and starts braking at the same point, so it has to apply a deceleration (emergency) of -5 m/s\u00b2 to come to a complete stop in order to also yield to pedestrians. Finally, in the third manoeuvre, the AV also travels at 30 km/h and begins to brake at the same distance as in the other cases but applying a deceleration of -1.8 m/s\u00b2, thus it stops after passing the crosswalk.\nOn the other hand, the behaviour of virtual pedestrians is modified to communicate different social information to the participant. As shown in Figures 3a and 3b, conservative pedestrians wait for the AV to fully decelerate and pause for one second before crossing, whereas daring pedestrians cross when the AV is 25 meters away from the crosswalk, prior to the initiation of the braking manoeuvre.

Data Collection", "content": "During the experiment, two types of data were collected to analyze the participant's interaction with the AV, including direct measurements (i.e., movement trajectory) and answers to questionnaires (i.e., subjective data).\nWithin Unreal Engine project and MVN Analyze software [17], [18], all data generated during the VR experiment were logged, comprising: (1) timestamps, (2) vehicle positional and parameter data (i.e., x, y, z coordinates, rotation, brake, steer, throttle, gear), (3) participant and other pedestrians po-sitional information and animations (i.e., x, y, z coordinates, rotation, .fbx), and (4) scene playback from the HDM view, the VR setup and the simulator, synchronized at 16 Hz. This allowed us to identify the moment when participants entered the vehicle lane, which we defined as the crossing event.\nBetween experimental tasks, participants had brief rest periods in which they did not leave the virtual environment when an accompanying researcher asked them the following questions about their subjective perception of the interaction they just had with the AV and their use of social information:\nQ1: How safe did you feel at the scene?\nQ2: How aggressive did you perceive the braking manoeu-vre of the vehicle?\nQ3: Did other pedestrians influence your decision to cross?\nQ4: Which pedestrians most influenced your crossing de-cision? None, those on your sidewalk, those on the opposite sidewalk or all of them indistinctly.\nQ5: How much mental and perceptual effort was required? Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex?\nAnswers to questions 1-3 were tabulated on a 7-step Likert scale [33]. Question 5 (tabulated on a 20-step Likert scale) measures the cognitive and physical workload during user interaction with the VR environment to understand how it is affected by different experimental conditions."}, {"title": "D.

RESULTS", "content": "This section presents the analysis of the impact of braking manoeuvre and social information on crossing decisions and questionnaire responses. To extract significant differences between the experimental tasks we employ the Student's t-test [34] and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [35] respectively."}, {"title": "A. Space Gap (L) results", "content": "The metric chosen to evaluate the crossing behaviour is the space gap which is defined as the distance between the participant and the AV, measured from the AV to the centre of the crosswalk when the participant enters the lane and is exposed to a possible collision (see Fig. 4). This informs us about their decision to proceed or delay crossing, as well as whether they crossed safely. Box-plots of the space gaps in each task of the experiment are shown in Fig. 5.\nThe Student's t-test [34] determines if there is a significant difference between the means of two related sample groups, considering both within-group variability and sample size. Table II expresses categorical statements, where a 1 in a cell denotes the rejection of the null hypothesis ($H_o : \\mu_i \\leq \\mu_j$) and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis ($H_1 : \\mu_i > \\mu_j$) with a confidence level of 90%. This implies that the space gap measured in task i (row) is significantly larger than that in task j (column).\nInitially, it is notable Spanish participants tend to advance their crossing event when pedestrians show daring behaviour, even in instances where the AV does not yield (L: t12 > t10). In the case of Australians, this only occurs when applying the moderate manoeuvre (L: t6 > t4, t5). A moderate manoeuvre consistently results in a larger space gap than an emergency manoeuvre, while an emergency manoeuvre also leads to a larger space gap compared to the no yielding situation.\nThe Table III provides a direct comparison of space gaps across both groups of different cultural backgrounds. The probability calculated by the Student's t-test indicates that the alternative hypothesis is accepted in most variants of the experiment in favor of the Spanish participants. In essence, this implies that the Spanish exhibit more daring behaviour compared to Australians, as supported by the analysis of the space gap."}, {"title": "B.

RQ1 Discussion", "content": "Co-located pedestrians cause the pedestrian under study to tend to cross alongside them even though, if the situation is perceived as threatening, their anticipation detracts from sense of safety, as well as amplifies the interaction perception as more dangerous and \"complicated\" (Q5). It is confirmed that inadequate social information could lead to exposure to injury (see t11, t12 in Fig. 5). Participants clearly differenti-ated between the types of manoeuvres, though a conservative attitude of the nearby pedestrians proving to have a greater impact on confidence than the AV deceleration."}, {"title": "D. RQ2 Discussion", "content": "The Spanish participants were willing to take more risks than the Australian participants, even allowing themselves to be overly influenced by the pedestrian group in situations where the AV did not yield. The Australians adopted a more cautious attitude and valued emergency deceleration as safer than the Spanish because of their internalized belief that they would only cross when there was a clear indication that the AV was going to stop. For the same reason, they reaffirmed that daring pedestrians did not advance their decision to cross because they did not follow them (Q3); instead, they waited to observe the vehicle's behaviour. Even so, like the Spanish, they also tended to cross together with nearby pedestrians when faced with a moderate type manoeuvre."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK", "content": "We conducted a cross-cultural behaviour analysis of Span-ish and Australian pedestrians within a VR environment. The findings reveal social information can modify road crossing decisions in the face of the same AV driving style. Further, they support previous assumptions about cultural differences in which pedestrians of Asian origin are more cautious than those of European origin. Among the limitations, this study took place in a a simple traffic scenario, with only one vehicle approaching and no other social activities in the background, except for the four pedestrians crossing from both sides of the street, as well as the influence of participants' past accident experiences was not considered. As future work, the behaviour of real pedestrians can be recreated inside the CARLA simulation to be detected by the virtual sensors equipped in the AV, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar. These synthetic sequences generated from the behaviour of real agents can serve as valuable resources for training and testing algorithms in the field of autonomous driving."}, {"title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENT", "content": "We sincerely appreciate the participation of all individuals involved in the study."}, {"title": "FUNDING DETAILS", "content": "This work was funded by Research Grants PID2020-114924RB-100 and PDC2021-121324-100 (Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation).

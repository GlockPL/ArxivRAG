For the LLMs, we identify significant biases. They exhibit a strong alignment (over 75% on average) with left-wing parties and a substantially lower alignment with center-right (smaller 50%) and right-wing parties (around 30%). Furthermore, for the VAAs, intended to objectively inform voters, we found substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat: While one VAA deviated in 25% of cases, another VAA showed deviations in more than 50% of cases.

As is often the case with elections, there are many people who are undecided which party they want to vote for. In Germany, the so-called Wahl-O-Mat serves as a well-established Voting Advice Application (VAA), providing an online platform that helps individuals inform themselves about the elections and the political positions of various parties.\n\nThe Federal Agency for Civic Education in Germany (bpb) has released the Wahl-O-Mat for every major state, federal, and European election since 2002. Its use is simple: (1) Users respond to a series of political statements by indicating whether they \u201cagree\u201d, \u201cdisagree\u201d or are \u201cneutral\u201d. (2) They (optionally) assign a higher weight (double) to statements they consider particularly important. (3) Users select the parties they wish to compare their responses with. (4) The Wahl-O-Mat ranks the selected parties based on how closely their positions align with the user's answers and presents this ranking to the user.\n\nThe political statements featured in the Wahl-O-Mat are curated by a team comprising political and educational scientists, statisticians, young voters (aged 16 and in the age range of 18 to 26), and other experts, in collaboration with representatives from federal and state civic education centers. Political parties receive these statements in advance and provide their official responses (i.e., \"agree\", \"neutral\" or \"disagree\"). Additionally, the parties have the opportunity to explain and justify their position with a brief statement. The bpb website provides more details about this process.\n\nThe Wahl-O-Mat for the 2025 federal election was launched on February 6, 2025 and includes 38 state- ments to help voters make an informed choice. For example, the first statement, illustrated in addresses the continuation of military support for Ukraine, reflecting Germany's foreign policy stance on international conflicts. Another statement focuses on a potential increase in the statutory minimum wage to 15 euros by 2026, emphasizing economic and socio-political considerations. Together, these statements cover a broad spectrum of pressing issues, ranging from domestic policies, such as labor laws and social security, to foreign policies, such as military support and trade regulations, to interconnected areas such as asylum and migration. A detailed list of all 38 statements is provided in the appendix for reference.\n\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI-powered information tools to assist voters in the lead-up to elections. In Germany, two such tools have garnered public attention: Wahl.Chat and WAHLWEISE.\n\nWahl.Chat (https://wahl.chat) was launched a few weeks before the federal election in early 2025. According to its website, it is described as"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Research into the algorithmic political biases of LLMs predates the advent of ChatGPT, with early studies proposing methods to mitigate such biases Peters (2022); R.

For the computation of this alignment, we used the original Wahl- O-Mat formula, which takes into account the double weighting of individual statements. Our analysis focused on comparisons with the seven largest parties based on recent polls: the center-right CDU, which is currently leading in all polls; the center-left SPD led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz; the center-left"}, {"title": "3.2 Results", "content": "First, the separate results for each of the three models are discussed and then jointly summarized.\n\nChatGPT 40. As part of our research, we queried Open AI's GPT 40 model with regard to 'its' opinions on the Wahl-O-Mat theses and its weighting (using simple jailbreaking to obtain answers). The prompts and results are presented in the appendix and show a significant bias: The weighted alignment was largest for the Left Party (mean alignment of 80.7% over five runs) followed by the center-left ecological Green Party (79.6%), and the party of the current chancellor SPD (75.3%). In contrast, the weighted alignment with the more conservative center-right CDU (47.5%) and the right-wing AFD (26.9%) was less than 50%.\n\nDeepSeek V3. We conducted the same analysis with DeepSeek V3, which exhibited comparable pat- terns. The lowest weighted alignment was observed with the right-wing AFD (25.42%), while the highest agreement was found with the SPD (86.30%) and the Green Party (84.76%). Strongly left-oriented par- ties, such as the Left Party (77.50%) and BSW (67.48%), also showed a high level of agreement. In contrast, alignment with the CDU (43.52%) and FDP (45.16%) was notably lower.\n\nDeepSeek R1-Distill-Llama-70B. When looking at smaller, fine-tuned models, the same biased an- swers could be created again. The highest weighted alignment was observed with the Green Party (73.60%) and the SPD (68.10%), followed by the Left Party (70.70%) and BSW (56.84%). In contrast, agreement with the FDP (51.86%) and CDU (49.38%) was lower. The lowest alignment was found with the right-wing AFD (32.20%).\n\nSummary. Figure 2 and Table 1 summarize the weighted agreements of the models with the seven parties considered. Thereby, Figure 2 also illustrates the variations across the five runs, which are more pronounced for the GPT 40 model in the cases of CDU (standard deviation (sd) of 10.2%) and the Left Party (sd 11.8%) compared to a sd of 1.7% in case of the SPD.\n\nIn addition, Table 1 presents the average alignment across all three LLM models, showing a clear pref- erence for the center-left ecological the Green Party (79.3%), followed by the center-left and left-wing parties, SPD and the Left Party, with alignments of approximately 76%. In contrast, the center-right CDU (47.3%) and FDP (45.4%), and the right-wing AFD (33%), receive the lowest alignments. This is in line with previous studies on the political biases of LLMs, as discussed in the introduction."}, {"title": "4 Analyses of Stochastic VAAs", "content": "After analyzing the LLMs, we will now conduct a more in-depth examination of the VAAs Wahl.Chat and WAHLWEISE, in which we compare the responses provided by the model to the Wahl-O-Mat.

These included SPD, the Green Party, and FDP, along with CDU and AFD."}, {"title": "4.1 Wahl.Chat", "content": "Wahl.Chat was queried to provide information about the positions of the corresponding parties with respect to the 38 statements that have been collected for the Wahl-O-mat. The questions were prompted in the following two formats:\n\n1. 'Steht die <party> der folgenden Aussage neutral, zustimmend oder ablehnend gegen\u00fcber: <statement>'\n\n2. 'Stimmt die <party> der folgenden Aussage zu oder nicht: <statement>'\n\nThe first prompt emulates the three options ('neutral', 'agreement', 'disagreement') that voters encounter on Wahl-O-Mat, while the second seeks a definitive response (either agree or disagree).\n\nFor each party, we entered the statements one by one into the chat, using both prompts. The results provided by the VAA were then documented and compared to the corresponding positions that the parties provided to the Wahl-O-Mat.\n\nWe found that in 25% of prompted statements, the Wahl.Chat answer differs from the one given by the Wahl-O-Mat. The largest difference was observed with the Green Party (30% non-alignment) and the smallest with the AFD (21%). More concerning is the fact that in 5.79% of the cases, Wahl.Chat replied"}, {"title": "4.2 WAHLWEISE", "content": "For WAHLWEISE the prompting was carried out in a nearly identical setting (same two prompts, parties and statements) as with Wahl.Chat, but in a chat process that was reinitialized for each prompt. In addition to an explicitly alleged neutral position, a reference to no clear position by the party, a stated lack of context or a refusal to answer the question were also deemed neutral during the analysis.\n\nIn the corresponding evaluation, 54% of our queries deviated from the answer the parties had agreed upon in the Wahl-O-Mat. Different from Wahl. Chat, however, there was a noticeable difference between the two prompts. Namely, the divergence from the Wahl-O-Mat over both prompts combined was between 50 and 62 percent for the individual parties. Looking at the individual prompts, the proportion of deviations across parties was between 50 and 74 for the first prompt and between 42 and 53 percent for the second prompt.\n\nIt should be noted that there was a clear tendency to presume a disagreement with the statement for the second prompt. In particular, 99 combinations of parties and Wahl-O-Mat statements with supposedly agreeing (15) or neutral positions (84) in response to the first prompt were now attributed a disapproving position. By contrast, no combination with a disapproving response for the first prompt had a neutral or positive response for the second prompt.\n\nWe provide an example of a sensitive deviation in the response of WAHLWEISE to the Wahl-O-Mat in Figure 3, consistent across both prompt, regarding the continued military support of Ukraine by the SPD, the party currently holding the office of Chancellor.\n\nTo give another example, for the thirty-first statement 'Das Streikrecht f\u00fcr Besch\u00e4ftigte in Unternehmen der kritischen Infrastruktur soll gesetzlich eingeschr\u00e4nkt werden.' (The right to strike for employees in critical infrastructure companies should be legally restricted.) the CDU gave a neutral position for the Wahl-O-Mat. However, in the first prompt, with the explicit option of a neutral position, they are ascribed agreement with this statement"}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "Our assessment of the reliability of AI-based Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) and LLMs in providing objective information and opinions on political statements ahead of the 2025 German election reveals several significant flaws, biases, and hallucinations. All of this is expected for both LLMs and VAAs,\n\nwhich are based on stochastic question-answering. However, for political information systems, like VAAs, we request more reliable and safe AI-systems to be designed in the future.\n\nLLMS Using the party responses to the 38 carefully curated Wahl-O-Mat statements, we first observed a strong alignment (on average larger than 75%) with left- and center-left parties such as the Green Party, the Left Party, and the SPD. This was particularly pronounced for DeepSeek V3 with alignments of approximately 85% for the center-left parties. In contrast, the alignments with the positions of the center-right (CDU and FDP) and right-wing (AFD) parties were much lower. In particular, on average, all LLMs aligned with the right-wing AFD only 28% of the time, marking the lowest overall alignment. This result confirms the findings of previous studies on political biases of LLMs, see e.g. Bang et al. (2024); Rettenberger et al. (2024); Rutinowski et al. (2024) and the references cited therein.\n\nVAAS Since AI-based VAAs rely on these LLMs as their foundation, we proceeded with a detailed examination of the two most prominent German AI-based VAAs, Wahl.Chat and WAHLWEISE, which aim to provide objective information to voters. We thereby found substantial deviations from the parties' stated positions in Wahl-O-Mat: While Wahl.Chat deviated in 25% of cases, WAHLWEISE showed deviations in 54% of the cases. For the latter, we even observed that simple prompt injections led to severe hallucinations, including false claims such as non-existent connections between the liberal center- right FDP and right-wing extremist ties.\n\nStochastic Question-Answering\nIn contrast to classical information retrieval, the two given ap- proaches, LLMs and VAAs, are both based on a stochastic paradigm of question-answering. AI-systems provide the most probable answer to a given question, and hence, not always the true answer. Furthermore, answers depend not only on the training data of LLMs and VAAs, but are highly dependent on the\nstyle of question. Therefore, prompting the VAAs with specific keywords is crucial for the agreement, disagreement, and neutral replies to the 38 questions. Similarly, manipulative prompting can lead to hallucinated answers and bypass input filters of VAAs. In summary, results of our study are very much expected by the stochastic nature of the AI-based frameworks.\n\nLimitations\nSince LLMs generate responses probabilistically, it is inherently difficult to guarantee the full reproducibility of all results since different runs can yield different outputs. We counteracted this by running all tests on LLMs and most tests on VAAs five times which helped to reduce stochastic variability and improve reliability. However, these tools are also sensitive to small changes in prompts. We did not conduct a sophisticated analysis of LLMs in this direction and only varied prompts for the VAAs in two ways. Additionally, there is usually a dependence on chat history. To reduce this dependence in the LLMs, we cleared the memory before each run and used different users on separate computers for prompting. But clearing memory was not possible for all models (DeepSeek R1) and the VAAs. Indeed, for WAHLWEISE we encountered that without any history, i.e., in case of the first prompt, all extremist statements were blocked. However, one simple query as history was already sufficient to bypass such filers. As we did not study a systematic analysis of the history having an effect on the agreement or disagreement, we can only publish results for the \"initial prompts\" that we believe to be the most representative results.\n\nAlthough we studied prompt injections for WAHLWEISE, this has not been performed systematically for Wahl.Chat. The reason is that WAHLWEISE blocks specific terms in the input question, while we observed Wahl.Chat to block terms in the output answer. This made it difficult to do a systematic experiment.\n\nMoreover, LLM models are updated almost continuously which can lead to quick changes in responses (Lunardi et al., 2024; Y. Liu et al., 2025). We also encountered such changes for the VAAs. However, to infer the reason behind such changes (e.g., model update, time of day, or just the inherent randomness), we should have taken a more sophisticated factorial longitudinal study design with equidistant measures (e.g., on a daily basis). In contrast to changes of the underlying models of Wahl.Chat, we did not observe any continuous changes of WAHLWEISE.info that seems to use a fixed model without updates.\n\nTimeframe of our Study Some of the mentioned limitations are due to the short timeframe of our evaluation, which needed to be completed before the 2025 federal elections on February 23, with the Wahl- O-Mat statements only published on February 6. Therefore, we finished the Wahl-O-Mat evaluation for Wahl.Chat by February 11, for WAHLWEISE.info by February 13, and for the LLMs by February 14. The investigations regarding prompt injections were finished by February 17. Occasional sensitivity tests between February 18 and 21 already showed that not all of our results could be reproduced, particularly\nfor Wahl.Chat. The latter may be due to its online learning nature, being based upon GPT-40 and Perplexity.AI, or updates introduced by the maintainers of the website.\n\nConclusions\nDespite these limitations we nevertheless conclude that AI-based VAAs are not yet suffi- ciently reliable. Although they have a huge potential for improving transparency in election programs and party statements, we believe that AI-based VAAs and LLMs must undergo rigorous certification and val- idation to ensure accuracy and trustworthiness in political advising, to be ensured before the deployment of VAAs. For future implementations of VAAs we request thorough design-implementation-evaluation cycles and scientific support as used by The Federal Agency for Civic Education in Germany (BpB) that released the Wahl-O-Mat."}, {"title": "Declaration of generative Al and Al-assisted technologies in the writing process", "content": "During the preparation of this proposal, we used the ChatGPT 40 model from OpenAI for minor language edits, aiming to enhance readability.

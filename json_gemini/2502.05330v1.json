However, existing methods reduce aortic segmentation to a binary problem, limiting their ability to measure diameters across different branches and zones. Furthermore, no open-source dataset is currently available to support the development of multi-class aortic segmentation methods. To address this gap, we organized the AortaSeg24 MICCAI Challenge, introducing the first dataset of 100 CTA volumes annotated for 23 clinically relevant aortic branches and zones. This dataset was designed to facilitate both model development and validation. The challenge attracted 121 teams worldwide, with participants leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks such as nnU-Net and exploring novel techniques, including cascaded models, data augmentation strategies, and custom loss functions.

Aortic dissections, caused by a tear in the aortic wall, are life-threatening conditions that disrupt blood flow, compromise organ perfusion, and may lead to complications such as rupture (Juraszek et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023; Carrel et al., 2023; Rolf-Pissarczyk et al., 2024). Advances in medical imaging, particularly computed tomography angiography (CTA), and therapies like endovascular stent grafts have revolutionized the diagnosis and treatment of aortic dissections (Rolf-Pissarczyk et al., 2024). A key step in leveraging these advancements is the segmentation of the aorta into clinically relevant branches and Society for Vascular Surgery/Society of Thoracic Surgeons (SVS/STS) zones (Lombardi et al., 2020) (see Fig. 1). This segmentation method enables automated measurement of the diameters and volumes of different aortic branches and zones, which are essential for accurate device selection, optimal stent placement, and improved outcomes while minimizing complications (Carrel et al., 2023; Rolf-Pissarczyk et al., 2024).\nDespite the critical need for multi-class aortic segmentation, existing methods often reduce the problem to binary segmentation, treating the aorta as a single object (Cao et al., 2019; Lyu et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022). This simplification overlooks the anatomical complexity and clinical importance of differentiating aortic zones and branches. Consequently, these methods have limited utility for tasks such as measuring zonal diameters and volumes, assessing the extent of dissections, and guiding precise device placement. Furthermore, no open-source dataset currently exists for multi-class segmentation of the aorta, its branches, and zones. Most available datasets are small, proprietary, and focused solely on binary segmentation, restricting the development and validation of advanced segmentation algorithms capable of addressing real-world clinical challenges.\nTo overcome these limitations, it is essential to identify and address the unique challenges associated with multi-class segmentation of the aorta:\n1. Complex Anatomy: The aorta has multiple zones and branches, each with distinct shapes, orientations, and sizes. These features vary significantly across patients due to differences in age, sex, body size, and disease states.\n2. High Annotation Effort: A single 3D CTA volume often contains 500-800 2D slices, making manual annotation of the aorta and its branches time-consuming. Moreover, expert clinician input is required to ensure annotation accuracy and consistency, further increasing the labor involved in creating high-quality datasets.\n3. Limited Dataset Availability: Existing datasets are typically small, proprietary, and focused on binary segmentation, which constrains the development of multi-class aortic segmentation algorithms.\n4. Lack of Standardized Benchmarking: The absence of standardized benchmarks for evaluating multi-class seg-"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "2.1. Existing Aortic Segmentation Methods\nThe aorta can be divided into the ascending aorta, aortic arch, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and iliac arteries. Most existing methods focus on binary segmentation of either the thoracic aorta or the entire aorta, without distinguishing between different aortic branches and zones (Lyu et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2023; de Carvalho Macruz et al., 2022; Sieren et al., 2022; Comelli et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022). While most studies utilize 3D CT or CTA images, some have explored aortic segmentation in other modalities, such as 3D MRI Manokaran et al. (2023); Guo et al. (2024); Berhane et al. (2020); Marin-Castrillon et al. (2023) and 3D ultrasound (Maas et al., 2024). Additionally, certain methods address the segmentation of the true and false lumen in aortic dissections. For instance, in (Jung et al., 2024) the ZOZI-seg model was introduced, a two-stage framework that combines a 3D transformer with a 3D U-Net for localized texture refinement. This model, trained on private data, segments the aorta into the true lumen, false lumen, and thrombosis. Similarly, Mu et al. (2023) proposed a method that segments the aorta into the true lumen and intraluminal thrombosis, leveraging a private dataset of 70 3D CTA volumes.\nRecently, a few techniques have gone beyond binary segmentation to multi-class segmentation, although they remain focused on chest CTA. For example, in (Zhong et al., 2021), a U-Net model with attention gating was developed for multi-class segmentation of the thoracic aorta using a private CTA dataset. Similarly, researchers in (Koo et al., 2024) proposed a CNN-based segmentation model trained on a private dataset of 30 3D chest CTA volumes to segment the aorta (excluding the iliac arteries) into nine zones using a multi-atlas method. As summarized in Table 1, existing methods are limited to either binary segmentation of the aorta or multi-class segmentation focused on the thoracic aorta. This highlights a critical unmet need for a large, standardized, open-source dataset enabling multi-class segmentation of the entire aorta, its branches, and zones, from the ascending aorta to the iliac arteries.\n2.2. Existing Aortic Segmentation Datasets\nAs summarized in Table 1, most studies rely on proprietary datasets that are not publicly accessible. However, a few publicly available datasets exist for aortic segmentation. The ImageTBAD dataset (Yao et al., 2021) contains annotations for 100 CTA images from patients with type B aortic dissections treated at the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital in China. Of these, 32 images are annotated for true lumen and false lumen, while the remaining 68 images include annotations for true lumen, false lumen, and false lumen thrombus. Despite its value, this dataset has notable limitations: it covers only a portion of the aorta (Figure 2(a)) and focuses solely on aortic"}, {"title": "2.3. Relevant Image Segmentation Challenges", "content": "Medical image segmentation has been the focus of numerous medical imaging challenges, including notable ones such as the Head and Neck Organ-at-Risk CT & MR Segmentation Challenge (HaN-Seg) (Podobnik et al., 2024), the Fast and Low-Resource Semi-Supervised Abdominal Organ Segmentation in CT (FLARE 2022) (FLARE, 2022), the Segmentation of Organs-at-Risk and Gross Tumor Volume of NPC for Radiotherapy Planning (SegRap2023) (Luo et al., 2023), and the KiTS21 Challenge (Heller et al., 2023). Despite their contributions, none addressed the segmentation of the aorta. The 2023 Segmentation of the Aorta (SEG.A.2023) challenge (Pepe et al., 2024) aimed to advance methods for automated binary segmentation of the aortic vessel tree in CTA images. The challenge provided participants with a dataset of 56 annotated CTA images from three institutions to develop their models. Although SEG.A.2023 marked significant progress, it was limited to binary segmentation of the aorta versus non-aorta and did not include detailed annotations for aortic branches or zones."}, {"title": "3.

Data Annotation", "content": "Our expert vascular surgeon (MC), who has more than 10 years of experience interpreting CTA images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, trained a team of four (MI, VSB, TZ, and AK) to identify critical aortic structures on CTA images. After the training, the trainees evenly split the 100 CTA images and performed manual annotation of the aorta, its branches, and zones on 3D CT images using the 3D Slicer tool (Fedorov et al., 2012). The annotation process was divided into two phases: first annotating the aorta and its thirteen branches, then dividing the aorta into zones based on the branch annotations. Throughout the annotation process, we leveraged the complementary information from the axial, sagittal, and coronal views of the CT scans to ensure precision.\nFor the segmentation of the aorta and the six iliac artery branches, we primarily relied on the axial view, referring to the sagittal and coronal views as needed. The celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery were primarily segmented on sagittal slices, while the left and right renal arteries were primarily segmented on coronal slices. To ensure consistency, each branch segmentation ended at the bifurcation point where it split into multiple branches. For example, the segmentation of the innominate artery ended at the point where it branches into the right subclavian artery and the right common carotid artery.\nFollowing the segmentation of the aorta and its branches, the aorta was divided into zones according to the guidelines outlined in Section 3.2.2, using the logical operator tool in 3D Slicer. The initial segmentations were reviewed and refined by an experienced medical imaging scientist (WS) and three surgery residents (JRK, WU, and MF), and were subsequently reviewed and edited by the expert vascular surgeon (MC) to establish the ground truth annotations.

Evaluation Metrics and Ranking Criterion", "content": "We evaluated model performance using two metrics: the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), also known as normalized surface Dice (Seidlitz et al., 2022). The DSC quantifies the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask (P) and the ground truth mask (G), ranging from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap). It is calculated as:\n$$DSC = \\frac{2 \\cdot |P \\cap G|}{|P| + |G|}$$\nwhere |\u00b7| denotes the cardinality (i.e., the number of elements in the set). The DSC balances precision and recall, making it a widely used metric for segmentation tasks.\nThe NSD complements the DSC by evaluating boundary alignment between the predicted and ground truth segmentations. It measures the proportion of boundary points within a specified tolerance distance (\u03c4), yielding values between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (perfect overlap). The NSD is given by:\n$$NSD = \\frac{2}{\\left|S_{\\text{pred}}\\right| + \\left|S_{\\text{gt}}\\right|} \\left(\\sum_{p \\in S_{\\text{pred}}} \\mathbb{I}(d(p, S_{\\text{gt}}) \\leq \\tau) + \\sum_{q \\in S_{\\text{gt}}} \\mathbb{I}(d(q, S_{\\text{pred}}) \\leq \\tau)\\right),$$\nwhere $S_{\\text{pred}}$ and $S_{\\text{gt}}$ are the predicted and ground truth surfaces, respectively. $d(p, S_{\\text{gt}})$ represents the shortest distance from a point p on the predicted surface to the ground truth surface, and $d(q, S_{\\text{pred}})$ is defined similarly. $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is an indicator function (1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise), and $\\left|S_{\\text{pred}}\\right|$ and $\\left|S_{\\text{gt}}\\right|$ denote the total number of points on the predicted and ground truth surfaces, respectively. In our computation, we set \u03c4 = 2.\nTogether, DSC and NSD provide a comprehensive assessment of segmentation performance, evaluating overall overlap and boundary precision. To rank participating teams, we adopted a \"rank-then-aggregate\u201d strategy, inspired by recent segmentation challenges (Ma et al., 2022; Bakas et al., 2018). The process was as follows:\n1. For each finalist team, we applied their model to 40 testing images. For each CTA image, we calculated the DSC and NSD for each of the 23 labels, then averaged them to obtain the mean DSC and NSD. This resulted in 40 DSC values and 40 NSD values per team.\n2. For each CTA image, we ranked all teams from 1 to N (N being the total number of teams), assigning two rank values per team: one based on DSC and the other based on NSD.\n3. For each team, the 40 DSC-based rankings and 40 NSD-based rankings were averaged, resulting in the average Dice ranking and the average NSD ranking.\n4. For each team, we averaged their DSC and NSD rankings to compute an overall ranking score.\n5. Finally, we ranked all teams based on their overall ranking scores."}, {"title": "4.

The nnUNet is trained for 800 epochs, incorporating data augmentation techniques such as random rotation and scaling, though mirroring operations were not used. The binary cross-entropy (CE) loss and Dice loss were used as supervised loss functions to train the model.

Initially, the framework segments the binary foreground region of the aorta, followed by cropping and fine-grained segmentation of individual aortic classes. To manage the intricate vascular structures, a hierarchical semantic learning strategy inspired by human cognition was employed, progressively incorporating anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures. This hierarchical approach led to faster training convergence and improved segmentation accuracy. The integration of hierarchical semantic loss resulted in a 5-15% increase in the Dice coefficient from the early stages of training. Furthermore, the centerline boundary Dice (cbDice) loss function was employed to ensure consistent segmentation across varying vessel diameters. The two-stage inference process first segments all foreground vessels using a low-resolution 3D model, followed by multi-class segmentation within a refined region of interest (ROI).

However, they differed in their outputs: the Coarse model was designed to determine whether a region contained foreground, while the Fine model segmented the foreground into 23 distinct classes. To enhance inference efficiency, the Coarse stage used a dynamic resolution approach, resampling input images into uniformly sized patches.

Significance of the AortaSeg24 Challenge\nThe AortaSeg24 challenge represents a major advancement in aortic disease management by introducing multi-class segmentation of the aorta, enabling precise measurements of diameters and volumes across different zones. These anatomical metrics are essential for guiding clinicians in treatment selection and planning endovascular procedures like stent graft placement. According to ACC/AHA guidelines, the risk of aortic dissection rises sharply at diameters \u22654.5 cm (Members et al., 2022), and earlier intervention can improve patient outcomes. Automating aortic segmentation reduces variability and the labor-intensive process of manual annotations, enhancing care quality. Furthermore, by streamlining aortic measurements, AortaSeg24 enables large-scale longitudinal data analysis, improving predictions of disease progression and rupture risk while supporting better clinical decision-making.\nAnother major contribution of the AortaSeg24 challenge is the release of 100 publicly available CTA images with expert annotations. As the largest publicly available dataset for multi-class segmentation of aortic structures, it addresses a critical barrier in medical image analysis: the scarcity of comprehensive, high-quality annotated datasets.

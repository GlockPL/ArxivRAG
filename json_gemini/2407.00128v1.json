We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve LLMS (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs (LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide diverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the most relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately, how training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability to respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results can make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of LLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better indexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization, enhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help in annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts. However, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include addressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the computational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and continuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content.

For instance, as of January 2024, the total number of websites worldwide has reached an impressive milestone of 1.079 billion. This figure marks a significant increase from the 185 million websites recorded 15 years ago, showcasing the exponential growth and expansion of the digital landscape over this period\u00b9. However, as the complexity of user queries and the expectation for precise, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses grow, traditional search technologies face mounting challenges in meeting these demands. Considerable advancements have been made in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) technologies [19], [30]. These efforts aim to enhance the ability of machines to accurately fetch content from the vast expanse of websites available online, efficiently store and index this content, comprehend user queries with higher precision, and deliver relevant, accurate, and current contents crawled from massive online websites, in an organized manner [39], [40].\nOn the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)- the cornerstones of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding, generating, and augmenting human language [11], [78]. The potential integration of LLMs with search engine services presents an exciting frontier in services computing, promising to significantly enhance search functionalities and redefine user interaction with digital information systems.

From the perspectives of search engines, leveraging LLMs equipped with RAG capabilities enriches the user experience by offering more meticulous and contextually aware responses. This not only improves the search accuracy but also elevates the overall user experience in handling complex queries, thereby increasing user satisfaction and engagement with the platform [29], [60].\nIn this work, we aim to explore the symbiotic relationship between LLMs and search engines, investigating how each can leverage the strengths of the other to overcome their respective limitations and to enhance thrier capabilities.

These point scores serve as training data for models that aim to replicate such scoring [130].\n\u2022 Pair-wise LTR Annotation: For pair-wise approaches, LLMs can determine the relative order between any two webpages in response to a query, considering both content relevance and user-specific information. This relative ranking aids in training algorithms to understand preferences within sets of documents [12].\n\u2022 List-wise LTR Annotation: In a more comprehensive capacity, LLMs can generate ranked lists of webpages based on their collective relevance and personalization for a query. This ranked order provides a template for list-wise LTR models to learn how to sequence document sets effectively [134]."}, {"title": "4.3.2 Online Ranking and Recommendation for Contextual, Personalized Search", "content": "Upon the establishment of an information retrieval model, LLMs can further enhance the search experience by leveraging users' browsing/searching history and profiles to perform online ranking of retrieved webpages or the recommendations of contents.\n\u2022 Ranking: Given a set of retrieved webpages for a search query, LLMs can evaluate the contextual relevance of each retrieved webpage by considering the specific needs and interests of the user as reflected in their search history and profile. By comparing relevance scores and incorporating personalization factors, LLMs can dynamically adjust the ranking of retrieved webpages, ensuring that the most relevant and personalized results are prioritized for the user [112], [151].

They adeptly extract relevant information by understanding the semantic meaning contained within queries and documents. This deep understanding enables LLMs to parse web pages for precise index term extraction, categorize content semantically, and tailor query suggestions based on historical user data. Adopting this capability ensures that search engines can process queries with a higher degree of accuracy, leading to improved retrieval that aligns closely with user intent.\n\u2022 Semantic Relevance for Content Matching and Ranking: At the heart of LLMs' functionality is their ability to analyze and evaluate semantic relevance, allowing for more advanced content matching and ranking algorithms. LLMs leverage their extensive knowledge base and language understanding to match queries with the most relevant content, even when the match is not immediately apparent from the query's keywords alone. This semantic analysis extends to the generation of contextual queries and enhances the search engine's ability to categorize web pages, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of content relevance and significantly improving the quality of search results.\n\u2022 User Profiling and Context Modeling: LLMs stand out for their capability to offer highly contextualized and personalized search experiences through in-context learning. By analyzing current search queries in conjunction with historical user data, LLMs can craft responses that are tailored to the individual's specific needs, preferences, and patterns of behavior. This level of personalization not only enhances user satisfaction but also makes information retrieval more efficient by prioritizing results that are most relevant to the user's context and search history.\n\u2022 Comparative Analysis for Ranking and Evaluation: Finally, LLMs excel in their ability to conduct comparative analyses, whether for the purpose of webpage ranking or for evaluating the effectiveness of search results. Through automated relevance annotation, contextually personalized online ranking, and annotating capabilities for learning-to-rank tasks, LLMs can significantly refine webpage ranking processes. Additionally, their role in automating A/B testing and synthesizing user interaction data into actionable insights marks a significant advancement in search engine evaluation.

We identify several technical issues as follows.\n\u2022 Memory at Scale: The scalability of CRUD operations, including creation, read, update, and detection, within the memory components of LLMs is critical to their effective functioning.\n\u2022 Consistency and Integrity: Maintaining data consistency and integrity during CRUD operations in LLMs is challenging, especially when dealing with real-time data updates and deletions, which could render part of the model's knowledge obsolete or incorrect.\n\u2022 Support to Efficient Retrieval and Editing: Ensuring that the LLM can accurately understand and utilize its decomposed memory segments for CRUD operations to maintain contextual relevance and coherence in responses. This involves sophisticated understanding and integration of user queries and stored knowledge.\nConsidering the technical challenges outlined above, it may be worthwhile to explore the following research directions:\n\u2022 Novel Architecture: Developing more advanced memory management algorithms and architectures that permit LLMs to more effectively access and update their knowledge base. This design could involve techniques like dynamic memory allocation or memory networks that can selectively store and retrieve information.\n\u2022 Incremental Learning: Introducing techniques for incremental learning that allow LLMs to update their memory with new information efficiently, or even forget specific piece of (outdated) information, are crucial for implementing CRUD operations effectively.\n\u2022 Exact Retrieval by Generation: Current LLMs' responses are generated through predicting token sequences with maximal probabilities. These responses are often plausible but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination\" [62]. However, in search engine settings, a memory-decomposable LLM might need to perform information retrieval from all data it has traversed during pre-training or fine-tuning. Thus, there is a need to innovate a method for \"exact-recovery\" of (part of) the training corpus."}, {"title": "5.2 Explainability of LLMs for Web Search", "content": "LLMs often operate as \u201cblack boxes\u201d, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their outputs.

This involves not only storing and retrieving information but understanding the relevance of historical interactions in current contexts. How they adapt their memory systems for dynamic and efficient use is a key challenge [38].\n\u2022 Adaptive Planning: Agents must plan their actions in environments that are constantly evolving. In the context of LLM4Search and Search4LLM, this issue requests adapting to changes in user behavior, search patterns, and the availability of online content. Planning in such an adaptive manner requires continuous learning and adjustment mechanisms [127].\n\u2022 Action and Interaction: Taking appropriate actions based on the contextual understanding and planning involves interacting with both internal systems of LLMs and external tools (e.g., crawlers, databases, and search engines). Ensuring these actions are both relevant and timely, while minimizing errors or irrelevant outputs, is challenging [24], [103].\nTo address above challenges, promising directions for future research are as follows.\n\u2022 Improved Memory Space: Developing advanced memory spaces that allow agents to more effectively store, retrieve, and utilize knowledge over time.

This paper conducts an in-depth examination of how integrating LLMs with search engines can mutually benefit both technologies. We focus on two main areas: using search engines to improve LLMS (Search4LLM) and enhancing search engine functions using LLMs (LLM4Search). For Search4LLM, we investigate how search engines can provide diverse high-quality datasets for pre-training of LLMs, how they can use the most relevant documents to help LLMs learn to answer queries more accurately, how training LLMs with Learning-To-Rank (LTR) tasks can enhance their ability to respond with greater precision, and how incorporating recent search results can make LLM-generated content more accurate and current. In terms of LLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better indexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization, enhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help in annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts. However, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include addressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the computational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and continuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content. We discuss these challenges and chart out required research directions to address them. We also discuss broader implications for service computing, such as scalability, privacy concerns, and the need to adapt search engine architectures for these advanced models.", "sections": [{"title": "1 INTRODUCTION", "content": "The dawn of the Internet services age has brought forth a deluge of information, making the role of search engines more critical than ever in navigating this vast digital land-scape [10], [65]. For instance, as of January 2024, the total number of websites worldwide has reached an impressive milestone of 1.079 billion. This figure marks a significant increase from the 185 million websites recorded 15 years ago, showcasing the exponential growth and expansion of the digital landscape over this period\u00b9. However, as the complexity of user queries and the expectation for precise, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses grow, tradi-tional search technologies face mounting challenges in meet-ing these demands. Considerable advancements have been made in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) technologies [19], [30]. These efforts aim to enhance the ability of machines to accurately fetch content from the vast expanse of websites available online, efficiently store and index this content, comprehend user queries with higher precision, and deliver relevant, accurate, and current contents crawled from massive online websites, in an organized manner [39], [40]. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)-the cornerstones of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding, gen-erating, and augmenting human language [11], [78]. The potential integration of LLMs with search engine services presents an exciting frontier in services computing, promis-ing to significantly enhance search functionalities and rede-fine user interaction with digital information systems. For example, new Bing utilizes ChatGPT to perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [60] by injecting search re-sults into the contexts of the LLM, generating compre-hensive responses based on the most relevant and current information searched from its database\u00b2. From the perspec-tive of LLMs, this integration significantly enhances their accuracy and informativeness by allowing them to access and incorporate real-time data and diverse content from the web, thereby expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-training/fine-tuning datasets and enabling them to pro-vide more accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses to user queries. Especially, search engines could help LLMs counter the hallucinations an innate of almost every LLM [29], [107]. From the perspectives of search engines, leveraging LLMs equipped with RAG capabilities enriches the user experience by offering more meticulous and contextually aware responses. This not only improves the search accuracy but also elevates the overall user expe-rience in handling complex queries, thereby increasing user satisfaction and engagement with the platform [29], [60]. In this work, we aim to explore the symbiotic rela-tionship between LLMs and search engines, investigating how each can leverage the strengths of the other to over-come their respective limitations and to enhance thrier capabilities. As shown in Fig 1, the technologies driving the development of search engines and AI models have historically co-evolved.

The data collection process is complemented by term extraction module extracting key terms and phrases from the content. Term extraction leverages advanced text analysis and NLP techniques that identify and categorize important information, thereby refining the search engine's match between user queries and relevant documents. The optimization of this process is further enhanced by utilizing metadata like titles, descriptions, and tags, along with im-plementing sophisticated algorithms for entity recognition, semantic and sentiment analysis [53], [108]."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Storage and Indexing", "content": "Document storage and indexing form the backbone of a search engine's ability to quickly and accurately match and deliver search results.

Obaidat", "Ni Li", "Xinyu Zhang"], "abstract": "Cognition refers to the function of information perception and processing, which is the fundamental psychological essence of human beings. It is responsible for reasoning and decision-making, while its evaluation is significant for the aviation domain in mitigating potential safety risks. Existing studies tend to use varied methods for cognitive state evaluation yet have limitations in timeliness, generalisation, and interpretability. Accordingly, this study adopts brain functional connectivity with electroencephalography signals to capture associations in brain regions across multiple subjects for evaluating real-time cognitive states. Specifically, a virtual reality-based flight platform is constructed with multi-screen embedded. Three distinctive cognitive tasks are designed and each has three degrees of difficulty. Thirty subjects are acquired for analysis and evaluation. The results are interpreted through different perspectives, including inner-subject and cross-subject for task-wise and gender-wise underlying brain functional connectivity. Additionally, this study incorporates questionnaire-based, task performance-based, and physiological measure-based approaches to fairly label the trials. A multi-class cognitive state evaluation is further conducted with the active brain connections. Benchmarking results demonstrate that the identified brain regions have considerable influences in cognition, with a multi-class accuracy rate of 95.83% surpassing existing studies. The derived findings bring significance to understanding the dynamic relationships among human brain functional regions, cross-subject cognitive behaviours, and decision-making, which have promising practical application values.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "HUMAN brain is a sophisticated organ that generates signals among regions through the cortical area interaction, which is established through a densely functional connectivity network [1]. Such a network helps provide an in-depth understanding of driving factors affecting behaviour and cognition, meanwhile allowing flexible and adaptive allocation of resources to accomplish task demands in high expectations [2]. There has been a concurrent rise in evincing that distributed brain areas are consistently engaged among one another during diverse cognitive tasks [3], [4]. Although considered an essential requirement, it is challenging to establish explicit connections among different brain areas. Specifically, there are critical concerns that need to be addressed, including how the same brain area underlies cognition among varied tasks and how the areas are correlated among divergent human subjects. Addressing these questions will reshape our understanding of inner-subject and cross-subject cognitive state paradigms underlying a multi-task mechanism.\nCognition, in essence, refers to the mental action or process of perceiving and reacting, processing and comprehending, focusing and thinking, memorizing and imagining, reasoning and computing, judgment and evaluating, storing and retrieving information, and decision-making and problem-solving [5]. Detecting one's cognitive state can help monitor working and memory load and intervene in time, which potentially helps in formulating proper decisions, accomplishing task demands, maintaining mental efficacy, or diagnosing relevant diseases. Since cognition generally rely on intelligence, experience, and sensation to betterment one's change in behaviours, its evaluation contrives the diminution brought by in-confidence, information overload, or multitasking. Insofar, the evaluation of cognitive state is way much more significant for high-load, high-pressure, and high-intensity personnel, such as pilots [6].\nFlight professionalism-related positions, such as pilots or unmanned aerial vehicle operators, require much more cognitive ability than that of other jobs. Maintaining a promising cognitive state during tasks is a fundamental yet challenging quality of pilots since it is also indispensable for spatial orientation and flying efficacy. In the aviation psychology domain, spatial orientation disorders that occur during flight missions (i.e. pilots have confusions and illusions about perceiving their surroundings and positions) are defined as psychological disorders, which are generally caused by decreased cognition and can exacerbate the potentials of accidents [7]. More substantially, the concept of \"suicide flight crash\" began to attract public attention in the Germanwings Flight 9525, and such cases are not unusual. For example, there are LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470, Japan Airlines DC-8, and Royal Air Maroc Flight 630, to name a few, which are all defined as \"intentional\u201d or \u201cdeliberately caused by pilot\" [8]. Additionally, there are speculations about the causes of the crashes of the Egypt-Air Flight 990, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735, but there is still no definitive conclusion to be drawn. As research highlights that cognition is extensively associated with mental health [9], [10], [11], evaluating the cognition state of pilots during flight task is not only crucial for their professional competence, but also critical for avoiding potential disastrous instances.\nAccording to the Aviation Safety Network, there were a total of 3, 822 aviation accidents worldwide from 2017 to 2023 (Fig. 1) [12], and 70% of those accidents were caused by operational behaviours, and such human errors are closely related to cognitive states [13]. Yet, pilots are of different ages, genders, and experiences, as well as varied degrees of endurance of fatigue, distraction, stress, workload, task, and information, leading to the distinguished cognition profiles. Therefore, this study aims to monitor the brain functional connectivity of cognition under multiple tasks for cross-subjects through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) signals since they are objective, non-invasive, cost-efficient, portable, and have high temporal resolution [5], [14]. By achieving the objective, this study is the first of its kind which sought to help interpret cognitive connections underlying brain regions, unravel invariant relationships among subjects, capture variability of cognition under the multi-task condition, and evaluate one's cognitive state in real-time, potentially improve pilots' sensitivity to emergencies, accomplish proactive decision-making management, and eliminate safety hazards. Key contributions of this study are as follows:\n\u2022\tThis study adopts EEG signals to map brain functional connectivity, analyse its hidden associations underlying cognition, and propose a multi-head attention-based EEG-Net for multi-class state evaluation in real-time.\n\u2022\tThree cognition-related tasks with three different degrees of difficulty are designed to capture subtle changes in brain functional connectivity.\n\u2022\tThe positively and negatively-related brain functional associations are interpreted from both inner-subjects and cross-subject perspectives to highlight the mutual activated brain regions for uniformity of cognition.\n\u2022\tA gender-based functional connectivity analysis is achieved to differentiate the contributing brain regions of cognition, bringing an in-depth and generalised understanding of cognitive state gender-wise.\n\u2022\tThis study targets the aviation domain, while the proposed methods and findings can be further extended and beneficial to other fields, such as clinics and industry."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "The evaluation of cognitive state encompasses three approaches: subjective questionnaire-based, task performance-based, and physiological measure-based. Each method has certain advantages and shortcomings, as described in Table I. Specifically, the questionnaire-based approach requires participants to fill self-reports during or after tasks, confronting subjective, resource, and timeliness concerns. The performance-based approach relies on participants' task measures, which might bring side effects like confrontational mentality or results overemphasis. The physiology-based approach processes participants' neural or skin signals for monitoring, which is inefficient and has limited interpretability. Insofar, to establish the brain functional connectivity, physiological measures have been adopted more often.\nYi et al. [15] adopted EEG signals to construct a large-scale dynamic functional connectivity network by proposing a multivariate correlation analysis wavelet coherence-S estimator in attention-related cognitive tasks. Zhang et al. [16] utilised functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to construct a third-order network connectivity tensor. They proposed a novel sparse tensor decomposition method with regularization to factorise the tensor into a series of rank-one components in predicting the cognitive behaviours of individuals. Similarly, Qu et al. [17] used fMRI to monitor brain functional connectivity for cross-subject analysis, and they applied graph convolutional networks (GCN) to exploit the relationships for cognition. Qi et al. [18] used EEG signals to construct functional connectivity to predict mental fatigue-related behavioural impairments. Additionally, Sareen et al. [19] once studied seven intellectual developmental disorder subjects to understand the associations among brain regions during the resting state and listening to music state. Sen [20] employed 475 subjects' fMRI to predict their biological gender and intelligence. There are many other studies constructing brain functional connectivity for different purposes, such as mapping cognitive simulation, disease detection, and revealing behavioural associations [21], [22], [23], [24].\nOther than analysing brain functional connectivity, many works are conducted around cognitive state evaluation. For instance, Zhou et al. [25] applied the domain adaptation technique to evaluate cross-subject cognitive workload through a maximum mean discrepancy loss, reaching an average accuracy of 74.86%. Chakladar et al. [26] integrated the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to classify cognitive state level using EEG signals, an accuracy rate of 87.04% is proposed under the arithmetic task. Wang et al. [27] adopted functional connectivity to monitor and distinguish between cognitive task activation and resting state, and a solid connection was established. Many more similar studies were derived by adopting physiological measures to evaluate cognition-related states, such as fatigue evaluation [28], mental state evaluation [29], and emotion recognition [30], to name a few. A brief summary of relevant studies can be found in Table II."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "With the objective of comprehending cross-subject brain functional connectivity for multi-task multi-class cognitive state evaluation, this section interprets the proposed flight platform, cognitive tasks, and the methodological design."}, {"title": "A. Flight Simulation Platform", "content": "In order to evaluate the cognition of pilots, this study develops a virtual reality (VR)-based flight simulation platform and the cognitive tasks using a 3D vision and the QT software. Specifically, the platform consists of a typical routine of a pilot during a flight mission, including route selection, takeoff, en route, approach, and landing.\nThe functionality of the platform is to offer pilots parallel sub-task operations during the flight mission to induce them to exhibit different levels of cognition. In doing so, we use a multi-screen device to display the flight mission scenario, the cognitive tasks, and the pilots' real-time EEG signals (Fig. 2)."}, {"title": "B. Cognitive Task Setup", "content": "Cognition is associated with multiple aspects, like memorising, calculating, and reacting [5], [20]. In order to comprehensively evaluate those abilities subject-wise, this study proposes three cognitive tasks corresponding to those functionalities displaying in the center of the platform. Specifically, the tasks are named: 1) N-back task, 2) Arithmetic task, and 3) Graphic Task. Each corresponds to the three functionalities and is interwoven with each other to evaluate one's information processing, problem-solving, and decision-making capacities.\n1) N-back task: The N-back task has been deployed relatively often and has been firmly proven to evaluate one's working memory, sustained attention, and cognitive agility [17], [2]. Specifically, the participant will be displayed with a line of numbers in a random sequence one after another, and he/she is required to compare the current stimulus (i.e., number) with the Nth stimulus that appeared before it. For example, when N = 2, the participant is required to compare the current number with the target number (which is located two stamps before the current position). If the current and the target stimulus are the same, he/she clicks \"Yes\" on the display, otherwise clicks \u201cNo\u201d. The participant is required to finish 18 clicks in one round. The degrees of complexity and difficulty grow exponentially when we alter the number of N or the reaction time for clicks. In this case, we fix the number to N = 2 and shorten the reaction time to 1, 600ms, 1, 400ms, and 1,200ms gradually for three difficulty levels to evaluate the participants' working memory in three rounds.\n2) Arithmetic task: The arithmetic task is generally applied to test one's reasoning and computing ability and has been adopted in many studies for cognitive state evaluation [33], [16], [5]. Here, we provide addition with two digital numbers for the arithmetic task. The participant is given the question and required to type in the results in the display and hit the \"Return\" button on the keyboard, or simply leave it until running out of time. There are 5, 7, and 9 questions in each round when setting the answer time to 5,500ms, 4,500ms, and 3,500ms, which ensures the three rounds with three degrees of difficulty to evaluate one's computing ability.\n3) Graphic Task: To evaluate one's attention, visual memory, short-term memory, and reaction capabilities, this study designs a graphic-based task. Specifically, we involve 5 shapes (i.e., rectangular, triangle, squares, circle, pentagon, and hexagonal star) of icons with 4 colours (i.e., blue, red, black, and yellow), which have 20 types of combinations. They will be randomly combined and displayed in front of the participant then disappear in a few seconds. Participants will be required to memorise the appeared graphics and determine whether the newly appeared graphic is in the lastly appeared batch by clicking \"Yes\" or \"No\" buttons on the interface. We set three degrees of difficulty by displaying 4, 5, and 6 graphics for each round containing 10 clicks, with a memory duration of 6 seconds and a judgment interval of 3 seconds. Notably, we ensure the operation time of each task is relatively identical to maintain the fairness. Detailed information and interface displays can be found in Table III and Fig. 2."}, {"title": "C. Dataset Acquisition", "content": "With the ethics obtained from the Medical and Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Northwestern Polytechnical University, this study acquired 30 subjects aged between 18 to 29 (\u00b1 2.11) to conduct the proposed cognitive tasks. Informed written consents were attained from all participants. The selection of participants follows a standardised and rigorous protocol that they have to meet the following requirements:\n1) All participants are with normal hearing.\n2) All participants have normal or correct-to-normal vision.\n3) All participants have adequate sleep before experiments.\n4) All participants are asked to avoid strenuous exercise before experiments.\n5) All participants are in good health, with no history of mental or intelligent illness.\nThe detailed participants' demographics and their task scores can be found in Table IV. Moreover, the overall experiment for one participant is around 12 minutes, and the detailed experimental setup is illustrated in Fig. 3."}, {"title": "D. Data Pre-processing", "content": "Since the questionnaire-based, performance-based, and physiological measures-based cognitive state evaluation approaches are complementary with each other, this study combines them for the labelling purpose to ensure a fair evaluation. Specifically, we use the NASA Task Load Index [34] to acquire the participants' self-reports after each task round. Their task performance and EEG signals are recorded in real-time during experiments.\nIn this study, we utilise the 20-lead dry electrodes for EEG signal acquisition with an NE EEG cap with signals acquired and stored through the NIC2 software (refer to Fig. 4 where purple leads are the adopted ones). The utilised electrodes are: Fp1, Fpz, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T7, C3, Cz, C4, T8, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, O1, and O2. Each electrode placement site can be read from: prefrontal (Fp), frontal (F), temporal (T), parietal (P), occipital (O), and central (C). Before conducting the cognitive tasks, participants are asked to sit immobile for device setup, including electrode installation, unilateral earlobe electrode referencing, electrode configuration, and signal quality inspection. After the initial setup, the participant can then start the tasks and their EEG signals are recorded and processed subsequently.\nWe use the EEGLab toolbox in MATLAB to pre-process the raw EEG signals, which includes electrode positioning, previewing, interpolation, filtering, baseline correction, and independent component analysis (ICA) for removing artefacts [35]. Fig. 5 demonstrates the raw and the pre-processed EGG signals. We set the sampling frequency of 0 to 500Hz. During the signal acquisition, there will be corrupted data caused by poor electrode contact, which leads to obvious waveform drifts or artefacts, thus, they are filtered and interpolated to get it recovered. We use a band-pass filter of 0.1 to 50Hz and a 46 to 50Hz band-stop filter to process the signals. Since there will be irrelevant electrical signals caused through the electromyographic effects of blinking or eye movements, they are corrected through ICA. Then, the processed signals are separated into five different frequency bands, including 8 (0.1-4Hz), \u03b8 (4-8Hz), \u03b1 (8-13Hz), \u03b2 (13-30Hz), and \u03b3 (30-50Hz). Before mapping the activity flow among the 20 channels, the EEG signals are normalised into a standardised and consistent scale through Equation 1, where $x_i$ is the ith signal in electrode x. Pre-processing details are interpreted in Algorithm 1.\n$x'_i = \\frac{x_i - min(x)}{max(x) \u2013 min(x)}$"}, {"title": "E. Functional Connectivity Construction", "content": "Functional connectivity can depict synchronous associations of information flow between two EEG signal channels [5], [22]. In this study, we use the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) to quantify the associations among channels in a time series sequence. PCC is calculated through Equation 2. It generates an association degree ranging from -1 to 1, indicating whether the association is negatively or positively related, respectively.\n$PCC = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(Y_i \u2013 \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i \u2013 \\bar{y})^2}}$\nSpecifically, n is the number of time-series segments, $x_i$ is the ith signal in electrode x, $\\bar{x}$ is the averaged signals in x, $Y_i$ is the ith signal in electrode y, and $\\bar{y}$ is the averaged signals in y. We use the 20-lead electrode EEG cap to record signals, thus, the adjacency matrix representing functional connectivity correlation is constructed and has a size of 20 \u00d7 20 for each subject. Then, all of the 30 subjects' functional connectivity correlations are calculated. By sorting the correlations among channels in the descending order for each subject, we then get aN \u00d7 C \u00d7 T correlation embedding, where N is the number of participants, C is the number of EEG signal channels, and T is the number of tasks.\nIn order to have a comprehensive analysis of the cross-subject functional connectivity, we combine the embedding through different levels, including overall combination, task-level combination, and gender-level combination. Specifically, we add the correlations among channels for all the subjects to get the overall connectivity flow. For the task-level, we assign weights to the degrees of task difficulty based on the participants' performance using Equation 3, where i is the ith correlation between channels, $w_i$ is the weight to be assigned for each difficulty level, $\\bar{P_i}$ is the average accuracy performance for a specific level given a task, and n is the total number of difficulty levels. Then the connectivity correlations are combined through the weighted addition. As for the gender-level, the functional connectivity correlations are combined for males and females separately.\n$w_i = \\frac{\\bar{P_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\bar{P_i}}$"}, {"title": "F. Mental State Evaluation", "content": "We notice that many of the subjects' correlation matrices encounter negative values, through addition and weighting, the highly associated connectivity flows are all with positive values and are further adopted for analysis.\nWith the sequential correlations among subjects, a set of highly influential electrodes are identified, and the EEG signals of those selected electrodes are given as input to the classifier for real-time mental state evaluation. The classification is performed among the multi-class cognitive states, including low, high, and transition stages.\nThis study utilises the NASA-TLX self-reports and the task performance to label the EEG signals for the multi-class cognitive states. Specifically, the Quartile method is applied to identify the range for each class, and then the report result and the performance are averaged to determine the class for each subject by fitting into the Quartile ranges. The distribution of the classes can be viewed in Fig. 6. Additionally, this study provides partial dataset and full code access in the GitHub link https://github.com/d-lab438/Multi-channel-eegnet.git.\nWe adopt the most commonly used classifiers for cognitive state evaluation, including Random Forest (RF), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and EEGNet. Additionally, we propose a Multi-head Attention-based EEGNet (MHA-EEGNet) for generating precise multi-class evaluation results. The proposed MHA-EEGNet architecture is depicted in Fig. 7, which extends the conventional EEGNet by integrating multi-head attention module following separable convolutions. This addition module enables the network to selectively focus on relevant spatial and temporal features across different channels and time steps of EEG data, facilitating more discriminative feature representation for subsequent classification tasks. By dynamically learning attention weights, the model enhances its sensitivity while maintaining robustness against noise and irrelevant signals, thereby improving evaluation accuracy.\nFor all the experiments, the stratified 10-fold cross-validation (CV) is applied, which allows to maintain the class distribution ratio in both training and testing splits during each iteration. This can help compensate for the unbalanced class distribution and mitigate the accuracy variance. We set the batch size to 10. Additionally, the categorical cross-entropy (CCE) is applied to generate classification results for the multi-class scenario, and the calculation is made through Equation 4, where $s_p$ denotes the predicted value for a target class, $t_q$ is the inferred score for each class in c, while c is the total number of classes.\n$CCE = -log(\\frac{e^{t_p}}{\\sum_c e^{t_q}})$\nNotably, the multi-class classification is conducted subject-independently to validate the identified functional connectivity. Through the CV results, the robustness and generalisation of the model can be validated. Insofar, as the signals from the 20-lead electrodes are also input into the classifiers as baseline results, which are compared to the results of inputting the selected electrodes. The performance is evaluated through six metrics, and they are calculated through Equations 5 to 10 (TP stands for \u201cTrue Positive\u201d, TN denotes \u201cTrue Negative\u201d, FP is \"False Positive\", FN is \"False Negative\", NPV is \"Negative Predictive Value\", and k is the number of folds).\n$Accuracy = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{TP_i + TN_i}{TP_i +TN_i + FP_i + FN_i}$\n$Precision = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{\u03a4P_i}{TP_i + FP_i}$\n$Recall = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{\u03a4P_i}{TP_i + FN_i}$\n$Specificity = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{TN_i}{TN_i+FP_i}$\n$NPV = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{TN_i}{TN_i + FN_i}$\n$F1 = 2 \u00d7 \\frac{Precision \u00d7 Recall}{Precision + Recall}$\nIn addition, all the experiments are conducted under the same computational environment, which is through a 64-bit Windows 11 Pro desktop, which has an 13th Gen Intel Core i7-13650HX processor with 16 gigabytes of memory and a Geforce RTX 4060 GPU."}, {"title": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "This section elaborates on the brain functional connectivity from three perspectives, including overall, task-level, and gender-level. Additionally, the multi-class cognitive state classification performance is illustrated to verify the associations."}, {"title": "A. Overall Analysis", "content": "By performing the pre-defined aviation and cognitive tasks, the participants' functional connectivity is identified and stored in a sequential list. Fig. 8 demonstrates the chord diagram of the subject-independent functional connectivity by adopting the top 20, 50, and 100 associations for all participants. The chord diagram is applied to illustrate the brain's electrical signal connections among electrodes. It is evident that Fz is the most significant electrode as it takes the widest segments, showing strong associations with other points like Fp1, Fpz, and F3. To better understand the functional connectivity concretely, Fig. 9 exhibits the connected electrodes underlying a brain map. Based on the demonstration, the associations are majorly located on the left hemisphere, and the frontal lobe is the most active region, including electrodes Fp1, Fpz, Fp2, F7, Fz, and F3. Under the lower left side, electrodes T7 and P7 from the temporal and parietal lobes are responsive.\nThe left hemisphere generally controls language processing and intellectual functions, which are related to reading, lexical retrieval, speech, logic, reasoning, writing, comprehension, and analytics [36]. The frontal lobe and prefrontal cortex demonstrate sophisticated interwoven, which indicates their solid roles in decision-making and semantic processing. Since the three tasks are associated with working memory, arithmetic, and visuospatial cognition, the connected brain regions are in accordance with the findings stated in [36], [37]. As for the temporal lobe, it has established connections with the frontal and parietal lobes in the left hemisphere, highlighting its characteristic in processing short-term memory. Additionally, it has been pointed out that the functional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal structures are crucial for encoding and retrieving [36]. This statement has been verified through our experiments, where the prefrontal cortex, frontal lobe, partial temporal, and parietal lobes are connected, in accordance with the well-established dominance for information retrieving, comprehending, and processing. However, the temporal and parietal lobes are not so much involved in the defined tasks, this might be due to the responsibilities of the two lobes which are generally involved with rhythm, smell, objects and spatial relationships identifications, interpreting pain and touch, and also spoken language comprehension [38], [39]. In this case, we highlight the cognition-related tasks, therefore, the sensory-related abilities (e.g., auditory, somatosensory) are not evaluated."}, {"title": "B. Task-level Analysis", "content": "In order to capture the subtle changes in brain functional connections in varied degrees of difficulty for the three tasks, here we interpret the correlations through task-level analysis. Table V presents the average performance of the three tasks. Fig. 10 displays the correlation matrix for the three tasks embedded with three difficulty levels.\nFor the N-back task, the majorly connected brain regions are prefrontal, frontal, and temporal. It is intriguing to also notice that the frontal and temporal lobes are relatively influential in the first level of difficulty, whereas the prefrontal cortex is significant in all levels of difficulty. Under such a scenario, the prefrontal cortex exhibits a high impact on the task, suggesting that it might play a pivotal role in working memory. This assumption is consistent with the findings proposed in [40] where they found memory suppression may occur in non-psychiatric sample populations under the control of prefrontal regions. However, the temporal lobe has established connections with the frontal lobe, demonstrating activation in the semantic and speech-related processing, which has been shown in [41]. This might be due to the fact that the N-back is the first task in the experiment, and we generally ask the participant to practice for a few rounds. In this case, they are allowed to ask questions, leading to the apparent activation in the temporal and frontal lobes. This kind of activation gradually fades as the experiment initiates, therefore, the connections are not evident in the second and third levels of difficulties.\nThe arithmetic task establishes more solid connections between the prefrontal and frontal lobes. In addition, the second degree of difficulty exhibits the most connectivity, suggesting participants are paying more attention and requiring more cognitive resources in this case. Yet, when they move on to the next difficulty level, the connections start to dribble away. This might be because the answer time for the third level is rapid, and the participant does not have sufficient time and effort in computing, therefore, many of them might decide to input random answers. Based on the average performance for task two in Table V, the assumption is supported, as this is also the task which shows the biggest decrease from level 2 to level 3 of around 15% accuracy rate.\nThe graphic task demonstrates intriguing connections where not only the left hemisphere is involved, but also the partial right hemisphere is responsive. Besides prefrontal, frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, the central region is also activated, and the electrodes C3, Cz, and F4 have been identified as associative during the task. In the first two levels, the central region is more engaged, whereas the right frontal lobe begins to activate in the third trial. The right hemisphere controls creativity, spatial ability, artistic, musical skills, imagination, and visual memory, thus, it is also known as the artistic brain [42], [43]. In this case, the icons appearing in the interface are increasing in the three iteration, and this might provoke the stimulus of a stabilised visualisation functionality and memory. By observing the correlation matrix and the average performance of task and NASA-TLX, the participants rate the graphic task as the most pressuring one and indicating it requires extensive cognitive loads. Evidently, the more brain regions are activated, the more cognitive loads are consumed."}, {"title": "C. Gender-level Analysis", "content": "During the inner-subject and cross-subject brain functional connectivity analysis, we notice that many of the trials are embedded with negative values, indicating participants confronting abnormal brain activation during experiments. Accordingly, here we interpret the brain functional connectivity for males and females through both positively- and negatively related correlations. Fig. 11 shows the connected regions.\nUnsurprisingly, the male group's positively related functional connectivity is consistent with the overall result, which is due to the number of males being much higher than the female group. When considering the female group separately, the connectivity varies to a noticeable extent. Besides the Fp1, Fpz, Fp2, F7, Fz, T7 and P7 electrodes, F4, Cz, and T8 are also inter-connected. Differing from the male group, the female group tends to involve more brain region activation in the right hemisphere. However, this finding is controversial with [44] where they found the male group generally had a higher local activation in the right hemisphere and the female group had a higher local activation in the left hemisphere. Nevertheless, their work was conducted under the resting-state scenario, whereas our study was performed under the task-state, thus, the divergence is understandable and explicit, yet intriguing. Notably, [45] indicated that there is a higher leftward asymmetry in the male group than the female group, which aligns with our findings. The connectivity map also suggests that the female group has more connections and they are generally crisscross across the central gyrus. This statement has been supported in [20] and [46], where they stated that the intra-hemispheric connectivity is greater in male brains and inter-hemispheric connectivity is greater in female brains. In addition, the wider regions involved in the right hemisphere of females highlight their superiority in object detection and episodic memory, and this finding is in accordance with [47].\nConsidering the negative correlations for males and females, the activation of the left hemispheric regions is more predominant in the male group than in the female group. For the male group, negative functional connectivity is majorly seen in the left frontal to parietal regions with the middle occipital gyrus involved. This finding is in consistency with the statements proposed in [46] where the male group tends to produce higher functional connectivity to the right insula (i.e., located between the frontal and temporal lobes), the left uncus (i.e., located in the temporal lobe), and the left medial orbital prefrontal cortex. For the female group, negative functional connectivity is relatively in the centralised and lateral regions, which can be seen in nearly all the lobes, and mostly activated in the post-central gyrus and the mid-cingulate cortex.\nIn addition, we decompose and calculate the power spectral density of the mostly activated positive and negative associations for both the male group and the female group. Fig. 12 displays the overall five bands' activities change. Specifically, the mostly engaged electrodes for males are F8, while F8 and Pz are more engaged for females. Based on the analysis, the 8 band has the highest activity during the conduction of the experiment, which is in accordance with [48]."}, {"title": "D. Cognitive State Evaluation", "content": "In order to reach a relatively generalised cognitive state evaluation, we have identified 8 electrodes (i.e., Fp1, Fpz, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, T7, and P7) which are significant and can capture subtle cross-subject association changes. Therefore, we utilise the real-time EEG signals from the 20 electrodes as input to the classifiers as comparative study. The generated performance is then compared to the performance when only inputting the signals from the selected 8 electrodes. Table VI and Fig. 13 display the detailed comparative performance.\nBased on the comparative performance, it is evident that by adopting the signals from the selected 8 electrodes, the multi-class classification performance increases. Specifically, all the classifier demonstrate comparative and even superior accuracy rates. Considering the precision, recall, specificity, and NPV scores of those classifiers for both input, we can learn that the model generats more stable results. The potential assumption is that the overall 20 electrodes might contain non-contributing associations (i.e., noises) which will affect the ultimate evaluation performance. Therefore, by removing the redundant and irrelevant information, the classification performance is enhanced of around 8.34% to 22.50%. We suggest using the selected 8 left-side electrodes for cross-subject cognitive state evaluation in future relevant research. More importantly, Fig. 14 exhibits the performance comparison among the five classifiers. The proposed MHA-EEGNet generates better results in both 20 and 8 electrodes' datasets, indicating its robustness in multi-class cognitive state evaluation."}, {"title": "V.

In our work, the influences of task differences, difficulty level differences, and gender differences on brain functional connectivity are all examined to reach better interpretability and cross-subject generalisation of brain connections. Key findings indicate that the left hemisphere is more actively engaged in the task-state cognition, different tasks induce varied brain region activation mainly around the prefrontal and frontal lobes, and females tend to exhibit wider brain region connections for the inter-hemisphere than males. Additionally, we find that the 8 band is the most significant frequency band in both male and female groups underlying negative cognition correlations. Based on the findings, this study extracts 8 key electrodes for real-time multi-class cognitive state evaluation. We further propose a MHA-EEGNet model for precise cognitive state evaluation. A 10-fold averaged accuracy of 95.83% is achieved, reaching the state-of-the-art performance.\nAlthough this study is the first of its kind which monitors brain functional connectivity using multi-task, multi-degree of difficulty, and multi-class context for cross-subject cognition evaluation, certain limitations lie underneath. One of the main concern is related to the negative correlations, which are not analysed task-wise, and this might bring assumptions on whether different types of tasks will provoke negative associations more easily. Additionally, since all of our participants are right-handed, whether the left-handed subjects will experience similar or opposite findings also needs to be examined. Moreover, the experimental time during the day has been recorded for each participant, yet its association with cognition is not analysed and interpreted in this study due to scope restrictions. Therefore, in future work"}]}

Open-weight LLMs present unique challenges, as existing safeguards lack robustness to tampering attacks that modify model weights. For example, recent works have demonstrated that refusal and unlearning safeguards can be trivially removed with a few steps of fine-tuning. These vulnerabilities necessitate new approaches for enabling the safe release of open-weight LLMs. We develop a method, called TAR, for building tamper-resistant safeguards into open-weight LLMs such that adversaries cannot remove the safeguards even after thousands of steps of fine-tuning. In extensive evaluations and red teaming analyses, we find that our method greatly improves tamper-resistance while preserving benign capabilities. Our results demonstrate that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem, opening up a promising new avenue to improve the safety and security of open-weight LLMs.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The most capable open-weight large language models (LLMs) released over the past year now rival closed-source frontier models [32]. The availability of open-weight LLMs for anyone to download and use has yielded numerous benefits, including lowering costs for end users and enabling academic research on safety and security [66]. However, as these models become increasingly powerful, many have raised concerns that they could be repurposed by malicious actors to cause harm, motivating research on how to safeguard these models against malicious use.\nExisting open-weight models often adapt safeguards designed for closed-weight models served through APIs [50]. These safeguards include refusal mechanisms and preference-based training, and they have provided substantial robustness against input-based jailbreaking attacks. However, recent work has demonstrated these safeguards are trivially defeated by attacks that edit model weights, breaking down after only a handful of fine-tuning steps [42]. This poses a serious problem for open-weight models, because adversaries have full access to model weights and can tamper with built-in safeguards.\nThe vulnerability of open-weight models to tampering attacks poses risks for model developers as well. Under background tort law, AI developers must exercise reasonable care, meaning they have an obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable harm. If malicious actors can easily customize models to cause critical harm, model developers may inadvertently violate reasonable care standards and become open to liability under existing law. Thus, there is an urgent need for more robust safeguarding techniques that can withstand tampering attacks.\nIn this work, we study the problem of tamper-resistant safeguards for LLMs. Unlike existing research on LLM safeguards, we focus on attacks that modify model weights, which we refer to as tampering attacks. This problem has been considered very challenging and by some intractable, as no method has yet provided substantial robustness to these attacks. However, making progress on this problem would provide a valuable tool to regulators and model developers by ameliorating the dual-use dilemma of open-weight models [38].\nTo demonstrate that progress on this problem is possible, we develop the first LLM safeguards that obtain strong robustness against a wide variety of tampering attacks. Our approach allows developers to add a safeguard such that tampering attacks cannot easily remove the safeguard, while preserving the general capabilities of the LLM. We achieve this by performing adversarial training against tampering attacks, leveraging approaches from meta-learning. We identify various crucial factors that enable our method to work, including the choice of tamper-resistance loss, the selection of train-time adversaries, and the two-stage approach that we use for building in safeguards.\nWe apply our method to develop tamper-resistant unlearning and refusal safeguards. In experiments, we demonstrate that our safeguards are far more robust to tampering attacks than prior methods. We stress-test our safeguards with extensive red teaming evaluations against 28 test-time adversaries, demonstrating resistance to fine-tuning attacks up to 5,000 steps. We hope our results foster future work on this important problem.

Moreover, the defender seeks to preserve a high value of safety_metric(\u03b8) after the adversary's move. We consider a compute-bounded adversary with unrestricted access to \u03b8g, enabling attacks that directly modify \u03b8g.

We assume the adversary will not spend a significant fraction of the compute required to pre-train the LLM, since at that point they could train their own model without safeguards.\""}, {"title": "3.2 Problem Definition and Metrics", "content": "We describe a general notation for quantifying the tamper-resistance of safeguards. Define G, \u03b8G, safety_metric, and capabilities_metric as in the threat model. Let attack denote a compute-bounded adversarial attack that maps \u03b8g to \u03b8a, with stronger attacks obtaining lower\nvalues of safety_metric(\u03b8a). We say that a safeguard G is tamper-resistant if its post-attack safety_metric(\u03b8a) is high across a broad range of strong test-time adversarial attacks Atest.\nNote that \u03b8g often modifies an underlying \u03b8 that lacks safeguards, often through a fine-tuning procedure. Additionally, strong tamper-resistance can be obtained if the safeguard simply over-writes \u03b8 with noise, but this model would no longer be useful. Thus, maintaining a high capabilities_metric(lg) is crucial, and evaluation of a safeguard must consider both its tamper-resistance and how well it preserves general capabilities.\nWe focus on two common safeguard domains: weaponization knowledge restriction and harmful request refusal. In each domain, we define safety and capabilities test metrics, which we use alongside test-time adversaries to evaluate tamper-resistant safeguards.\nWeaponization knowledge restriction. In weaponization knowledge restriction, safeguards prevent the model from producing text about weaponization knowledge, while preserving capabilities for benign knowledge domains. Existing safeguards of this nature include representation engineering methods like circuit breaking [69]. The safety_metric is defined as error on a forget set, and the capabilities_metric is defined as accuracy on a retain set. Specifically, we consider the problem of restricting biosecurity, chemical security, and cybersecurity knowledge, and evaluate the resulting model on the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark [29]. WMDP contains 3,668 multiple-choice questions, spanning biosecurity, chemical security, and cybersecurity knowledge. Importantly, WMDP questions do not evaluate hazardous knowledge directly, but instead measure proxy expert-level knowledge for each hazardous domain, such that suppressing the expert-level knowledge would also suppress the hazardous knowledge. We define the forget set as the respective hazardous knowledge subject in WMDP, and retain set as the complement of the given subject in MMLU [17], a multi-task question-answering benchmark spanning 57 tasks across a variety of knowledge domains.\nHarmful request refusal. In the harmful request refusal setting, safeguards prevent the model from producing \"harmful\" outputs. We define the safety_metric as the complement of average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various jailbreaking attacks, while the capabilities_metric captures the conversational abilities of OG. Specifically, we use a static set of test cases from HarmBench, an automated red-teaming framework for measuring prompt jailbreak robustness in LLMs, to evaluate jailbreak ASR [35] after tampering attacks. We use MT-Bench, a multi-turn question-answering benchmark graded by an LLM judge, to evaluate conversational abilities [63]."}, {"title": "3.3 Red Teaming", "content": "To properly measure the robustness of tamper-resistant safeguards, we conduct red-teaming with up to 28 adversaries, including many that are unseen at training time. In our evaluations, we subject our method to adversaries with varying compute budgets, access to held-out datasets, and diverse hyperparameters. For fine-tuning adversaries, we vary the learning rate, learning rate scheduler, optimization algorithm, and batch size. Many of these adversaries were fixed during early experiments, with some added over time as we found attacks that broke intermediate versions of our method. Extensive stress testing of this nature is critical for obtaining confidence in a tamper-resistant safeguard. For research on developing these safeguards, extensive red teaming also allows measuring incremental progress, using the number and strength of existing attacks one can defend against as a robustness metric."}, {"title": "4 Safeguard Tamper-Resistance Training", "content": "To obtain tamper-resistant safeguards, we propose a new method outlined in Algorithm 1 inspired by adversarial training and meta-learning to directly strengthen LLM safeguards against tampering attacks, called Tampering Attack Resistance (TAR). We identify unique properties of this adversarial training regime and leverage them to improve robustness.\nOur method for training tamper-resistant safeguards consists of two phases: (1) model safeguarding and (2) tamper-resistance training."}, {"title": "4.1 Model Safeguarding", "content": "The method begins by including an initial safeguard G into a base model \u03b8. For example, initial safeguards for knowledge restriction can be drawn from a wide variety of existing methods, including circuit breaking [29] or constrained gradient ascent for a particular knowledge domain. Similarly, we can include a refusal safeguard by performing RLHF [41] or DPO [43] on refusal completions. Importantly, these initial safeguards do not need to be tamper-resistant. Empirically, we find that this safeguarding step is important for obtaining strong tamper-resistance."}, {"title": "4.2 Tamper-Resistance Training", "content": "Starting from \u03b8g, we train the tamper-resistant \u03b8 using a novel adversarial training procedure. Namely, we train against a set of tampering attacks Atrain, where the defender's objective is to maximize a proxy safety_metric after applying an adversarial attack attack ~ Atrain to \u03b8. Since it may not be feasible to differentiate through attack, we draw on insights from prior work in meta-learning, defining attack(\u03b8) = \u03b8 = \u03b8g + attack'(\u03b8G) as a perturbation on top of initial parameters, where backpropagation through attack' is approximated with a straight-through estimator [5].\nWe focus on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) adversaries where attack applies several steps of opti-mization to \u03b8g, which allows straight-through estimation through attack' to benefit from the setting and approximations of first-order MAML [12]. However, we note key differences in our approach from standard meta-learning and prior methods [12, 16]. In particular, traditional meta-learning techniques seek to obtain a model initialization that is close to optimality on multiple test distributions. In our setting, we seek to obtain an initialization that is far from optimality on multiple adversaries' test distributions. Novel to our approach in this new setting is the use of a tamper-resistance loss in the \"outer loop\" that differs from the fine-tuning adversary's loss function and serves to maximize the proxy safety metric. We depict this structure in Algorithm 1, and explain the objective below.\nImpeding the adversary's loss. The aim of tamper-resistance training is to prevent adversaries with large compute budgets from reducing the safety_metric at test-time. In adversarial training for tamper-resistance, we define a tamper-resistance loss LTR that counters attack. We operational-ize our goal of avoiding adversary optimality as searching for \u03b8 such that LTR is minimized for attack(\u03b8)."}, {"title": "5 Experiments", "content": "We evaluate TAR in weaponization knowledge restriction and harmful request refusal settings, with results shown in and respectively.

For each weaponization domain, we assign DTR to the corresponding forget set described in Appendix D.1. We proceed to sample train-time 64-step fine-tuning attacks from different data distributions, detailed in Appendix D.2. We use N = 750 outer loop steps, ScheduleFree AdamW [9] with a learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10-5 as the outer loop tamper-resistance optimizer, and loss scales of XTR = 4.0, Aretain = 1.0.

We also design two baseline methods for knowledge restriction: Min Posterior, which minimizes posterior loss on forget set tokens; Max Entropy, which maximizes entropy on forget set tokens.

To stress-test the tamper-resistance of our models, we conduct an extensive suite of supervised fine-tuning attacks with 28 distinct adversaries. We vary the optimizer, number of optimization steps, learning rate, learning rate schedule, fine-tuning dataset, batch size, and overall fine-tuning method (e.g., full fine-tuning versus parameter-efficient fine-tuning). By default, our attacks use 1,000 fine-tuning steps, although some use 5,000 steps. Full details for these adversaries are provided in Table 9.\nWe show red teaming results in Figures 4 and 7. While baseline safeguards withstand fine-tuning attacks in a small number of cases, most adversaries succeed in removing the safeguards. By contrast, our TAR safeguard is robust to a wide range of adversaries. This shows that tamper-resistance is a tractable problem on which progress can be made. However, our method is currently not robust to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) attacks (adversaries 27 and 28), highlighting the importance of extensive red teaming when developing tamper-resistant defenses. We hypothesize that future work could easily address this issue, as we demonstrate in Appendix C.3 that targeted patching of vulnerabilities is possible.\nGeneralization to stronger test-time attacks. In Figure 5, we show a fine-tuning attack at an LR of 2 \u00d7 10-5 that attempts to recover biosecurity knowledge on our TAR model and a model safeguarded with LLMU. We find that the tamper-resistance of TAR generalizes far beyond the 64 steps used by train-time adversaries. Surprisingly, we observe that the test-time adversary's cross-entropy loss does not decrease below 7 for all 1,000 steps. Moreover, the loss enters a plateau and does not decrease at all after 200 steps. In Appendix C.2, we find that the length and height of this plateau can be increased by increasing the number of inner loop steps during adversarial training. As a point of reference, we show the progression of the same attack on LLMU. In this case, the adversary's loss decreases to within the recovery region in under 20 steps. We note that the adversary's test loss decreasing into the recovery region does not always correspond with recovery on downstream metrics (e.g., WMDP), but often does."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "We introduced a novel method for implementing tamper-resistant safeguards for LLMs and explored applications in weaponization knowledge restriction and harmful refusal training.

Let ho(D) denote the distribution of post-decoder layer residual stream activations for input sequences sampled from some data distribution D and model weights \u03b8. We define rand_hashed(x) for some input sequence x, which returns fixed Gaussian-sampled vectors that are chosen via hashing the corresponding input token for each residual stream index of x in \u03b8. As a proxy for scrubbing target representations according to downstream task labels, we propose a weaponization knowledge restriction safeguard termed Random Mapping, which maps he(DTR) to random noise as follows:\n$\\min_\\theta \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim D_{TR}} \\Bigg[1 - \\frac{h_\\theta(x) \\cdot \\text{rand\\_hashed}(x)}{\\|h_\\theta(x)\\| \\cdot \\|\\text{rand\\_hashed}(x)\\|} \\Bigg] + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{LLM}}(\\theta; D_{\\text{retain}})$ (3)\nThe objective of Equation 3 maximizes cosine similarity between row vectors in the residual stream in every layer of the LLM from h(DTR) and the hashed random vectors from rand_hashed(\u00b7).

For weaponization knowledge restriction, we summarize our intuition for ideal tamper-resistance loss design, corroborated by our empirical findings : we seek to flatten the adversary's loss at a high value, rather than simply raise its y-intercept.\nWe choose the tamper-resistance loss LTR as an entropy loss to be maximized during the adversary's cross-entropy fine-tuning trajectory, since maximizing entropy would impede the adversary's cross entropy loss from decreasing during fine-tuning. In other words, we wish to obtain \u03b8 such that after an adversary performs a fine-tuning attack on \u03b8 via a cross-entropy loss, entropy is still high. We find that this formulation achieves the desired flattening behavior, and we depict the difference in flattening between the choosing LTR to be a negative cross-entropy loss and negative entropy loss .

Using this trick, we collect all K parameter coordinates along the trajectory into a single batch for computing the tamper-resistance losses, effectively sampling attack from Atrain non-IID. To further improve runtime efficiency, we do not compute the tamper-resistance loss LTR on all K steps and instead sub-sample coordinates along the trajectory for computing LTR within an adversary batch, for example every 4 adversary optimization steps.

We use ZeRO Stage 3 from DeepSpeed [44], which shards optimizer states, gradients, and parameters during training. While the efficiency trick in Appendix B.3 improves runtime, we note additional considerations for conserving GPU memory.\nFirst, simulating fine-tuning attacks that require additional state (e.g., momentum) in the inner loop of Algorithm 1 requires initializing a fresh optimizer for every outer loop iteration. Since we use an outer-loop optimizer that also requires maintaining state (ScheduleFree AdamW [9]), we move the outer loop optimizer to the CPU before instantiating inner-loop optimizers.\nSecond, first-order meta-learning in smaller models can typically be implemented by running multiple forward passes for each inner loop iteration, averaging losses, then backpropagating on the averaged loss term. However, because each inner-loop tamper-resistance loss term (LTR in Algorithm 1) is computed on a separate forward pass, this requires maintaining K computation graphs in memory. Since this is infeasible on reasonable hardware for LLMs with billions of parameters, we circumvent this inefficiency by accumulating tamper-resistance gradients in a separate data structure (gTR in Algo-rithm 1).

We exclude the unseen forget distribution adversaries for a total of 24 attacks, as we were unable to obtain an equally high quality held-out dataset for Chemical Security and Cybersecurity.\nFor all subjects, we compare the effect of different optimizers (AdamW, Adadelta, and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Nesterov Momentum, Schedule Free AdamW) [60, 25, 55, 9], learning rates (2 \u00d7 10-6,2 \u00d7 10\u22125,4 \u00d7 10\u22125), and learning rate scheduling techniques (SGDR and 30 steps of linear warmup) [33].\nSimilar to Table 7, we use F-Pile, F-Chem, F-Cyber, OOD-F, and Retain in the Dataset Column to denote the respective datasets described in Appendices E.1 and D.2. Separate from the R\u2192F train-time adversary, R\u2192F at test-time represents the combination of 0.4 \u00d7 Opt. Steps of Forget-set SFT followed by 0.6 \u00d7 Opt. Steps of Retain-set SFT. In practice, we found that this fraction composed a potent attack which we sought robustness against as described in Appendix C.3.\nIn the Optimizer column, Schedule Free is an abbreviation of AdamW Schedule Free and SGD Nesterov is an abbreviation of SGD with Nesterov Momentum. In cases where the adversary used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via LoRA adapters [18], we used a LoRA config with an attention dimension, or rank, of 16, a LoRA alpha value of 32, a LoRA dropout of 0.05, on target linear modules:\n{'up_proj', 'down_proj\u2019,\u2018gate_proj\u2019,\u2018q_proj\u2019,\u2018k_proj\u2019,\u2018v_proj\u2019,\u2018o_proj\u2019}."}, {"title": "E.2 Harmful Request Refusal", "content": "For the harmful request refusal setting, we conduct 5"}]}

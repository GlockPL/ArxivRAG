The numbers are expected to reach 68% by 2050 [10]. Several socioeconomic and political factors contribute to this rapid urbanization. For instance, large cities offer more employment and educational opportunities and social and cultural attractions. However, it also has a significant environmental and social impact, and the concerned public authorities are urged to act quickly by maintaining a balance between the rapid expansion and resources and infrastructure of the cities [10]. This balance between resources and expansion of the cities requires a multifaceted approach involving sustainable planning, efficient resource management, and innovative solutions. This will lead to more sustainable cities and societies.\nThe concept of sustainable cities has been around for some time, however, the term sustainable societies is relatively new. Sustainable cities are generally associated with the environmentally friendly development of cities by promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns. However, the term sustainable society extends the concept of sustainable cities by bringing several important components, such as inclusive governance, social equity, economic viability, and cultural vibrancy. Sustainable cities and societies strive for a fine balance among environmental, societal, and economic aspects of urban life, ensuring the long-term feasibility of quality of life for residents through proper planning and transformation via modern technologies. Environmental sustainability, which prioritizes and advocates a responsible interaction with the environment, involves several elements, such as promoting renewable sources of energy (hydro, wind, and solar), waste management (e.g., recycling or proper disposal), afforestation (e.g., planting more trees and halting deforestation), and sustainable transportation (e.g., walking, cycling, and encouraging zero emission). Social Sustainability, on the other hand, involves inclusive governance (e.g., involving or considering all groups of citizens in policy-making), equal opportunities and public services (e.g., education, healthcare, jobs, and transportation for all), and justice. Similarly, economic Sustainability focuses on the creation of job opportunities and supporting local economic growth, etc.,\nConsidering the importance and benefits of sustainable cities and societies, the United Nations (UN) has also initiated several programs supporting sustainable cities and societies in different ways. For instance, in 2015, the UN General Assembly defined 17 goals for sustainable development, which are known as \"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\". The majority of these goals aim at inclusiveness, safety, resilience, and sustainability of cities and societies. Moreover, the UN has a dedicated working group/agency namely \"UN-Habitat\" advocating for socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.\nDespite the significant efforts, several economic, social, environmental, technical, and political challenges associated with developing sustainable cities and societies are yet to be resolved. For instance, sustainability initiatives/projects require an initial investment for the new infrastructure or upgrading the existing infrastructure to support sustainability initiatives. Moreover, generally, the public tends to be reluctant to such initiatives due to cultural resistance, which requires public awareness [135]. Moreover, addressing the gap among different socioeconomic groups and the disparities in access to sustainable resources and services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, is also very challenging.\nTo overcome these challenges, a multifaceted approach is needed by involving all the stakeholders including public authorities, the business community, and the general public and communities. Modern technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics, the Internet of Things (IoTs), material sciences, Building Management Systems (BMS), Sensors, and telecommunication technologies are playing their part in providing innovative solutions to address the diverse challenges of sustainable cities and societies, such as resource management, environmental conservation, and public awareness [5]. Like other modern technologies, social media informatics also plays a crucial role in developing sustainable cities and societies by leveraging the data and information shared on different platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, for different tasks and applications to enhance urban living and foster sustainable practices. For instance, it could facilitate inclusive decision-making by engaging them at a"}, {"title": "1.1 Scope of the Survey", "content": "The survey revolves around social media informatics applications for sustainable cities and societies.

During this time, several interesting papers including survey articles exploring different aspects of sustainable cities and societies have been published. Being a multidisciplinary research area, these surveys focus on certain aspects of sustainable cities and societies. Some surveys discuss the literature on general frameworks, models, and approaches to sustainable cities and societies [93]. For instance, Bibri et al. [41] provide an overview of various sustainable city models and smart city approaches reported in the literature. The authors discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed models by providing a detailed comparative analysis of the models. Similarly, [157] provided a detailed overview of the sustainability principles and trends in the literature. Talwar et al.

Within the technology framework in developing sustainable cities, social media platforms provide a dedicated environment for people, policymakers, and organizations to connect, cooperate, and unite in marching toward shared objectives. The literature already reports the effectiveness of social media and social media informatics in resilient and sustainable cities. For instance, Yang et al. [188] systematically examine the unique dimensions of location-centric social media data. They focus on spatial, temporal, semantic, and social aspects to address key challenges like data heterogeneity, quality, and privacy. The authors also explored the potential opportunities for urban analytics"}, {"title": "2.1.1 Public Health and Well-being", "content": "Real-time insights from social media informatics are revolutionizing urban health-care. It facilitates public health officials in different tasks, such as health campaigns, controlling misinformation, keeping track of health trends, and being vigilant about disease outbreaks. For instance, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter were crucial in tracking public mood and disseminating information during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study by Chen et al. [52] highlights the role of social media informatics in monitoring the spread of the virus and understanding public response to health measures. Another study by Liu et al. [109] emphasizes social media data for pandemic predictive modeling in epidemiology to address health crises preemptively. Similarly, using social media informatics can significantly enhance the impact of public health campaigns and preventive healthcare strategies. Through careful analysis of public discourse, health authorities can gain valuable insights into emerging health concerns and misconceptions [112]. This enables them to refine their communication strategies and effectively address the needs of the public. This can allow researchers to develop targeted social media campaigns to address specific health behaviors or promote vaccination and healthy lifestyle choices. It can also effectively increase community engagement and compliance. In addition, social media platforms allow for direct engagement with the public, offering a means for authorities to address concerns, debunk misconceptions, and deliver timely health guidance [195]. Collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data from social media allows for identifying at-risk populations, leading to more targeted and fair health interventions. However, several challenges are associated with the effective use of social media in critical applications like healthcare. Some key challenges include the processing of noisy and unstructured data, bias, misinformation, adversarial attacks,"}, {"title": "2.1.2 Education", "content": "Social media is also playing its part in the educational sector by contributing to sustainable education and learning in several ways. For instance, social media and online social networks/platforms facilitate learners by sharing learning materials and providing resources for collaboration. The collaboration on social networks for education and learning builds global educational networks and communities, promoting lifelong learning that leads to a sustainable education system [189]. The educational networks and communities could serve different purposes. For instance, teachers can share instructional content and motivate students to gain access to remote learning resources by using social media platforms. Similarly, public authorities and policymakers could use the data and insights from the data shared in these networks can use it for informed decisions and policy-making, resulting in focused educational programs or data-driven curricula that align with the community's changing requirements [116]. Educators and students could also use these networks for sharing learning materials, resources, and best learning and teaching practices, leading to more effective collaborative learning environments. According to Lacka et al., [104], social media informatics could be very useful in determining students' needs and effective teaching tactics, leading to personalized learning experiences. The study reveals that while virtual learning can aid in achieving the goals of educational institutions with additional inputs, students relying on social media are more efficient with the strategic use of modern technologies. In addition, AI-powered social media platforms can enable peer-to-peer learning, allowing students and community members to share knowledge, provide assistance, and work together on projects outside the confines of a traditional classroom [18]. Ajibade et al. [15] have explored how integrating social media with e-learning platforms has improved student engagement and yielded insightful information on learning behaviors. The authors used a technology acceptance model to examine how Nigerian college students and teachers adopt social media for e-learning.\nHowever, like other applications, social media informatics faces several challenges in the education sector. For instance, extracting relevant content is very challenging, requiring accurate social media informatics algorithms and high computational resources. Similarly, due to the lack of proper control, false information on social media could mislead learners and make access to accurate and reliable content more challenging [128]. The presence of echo chambers on social media could also harm the critical thinking of students by only exposing them to content relevant to their existing beliefs [111]. In addition, the digital divide, privacy and security concerns, and legal and regulatory issues also reduce the effectiveness of social media informatics in education."}, {"title": "2.1.3 Transportation", "content": "Social media informatics also contribute to sustainable transportation in several ways. For instance, social media informatics insights could be beneficial during emergencies, such as floods, or unexpected road closures, where quick responses and updates on the road status are crucial [142]. The literature reports several interesting works in this direction. For instance, Ahmad et al. [12] proposed an image processing framework that automatically collects and analyzes social media imagery for real-time updates on road conditions during floods. The authors mainly carried out two tasks. Firstly, images, providing evidence for road passability, are collected through"}, {"title": "2.1.4 Environmental Monitoring and Awareness (Water and Air Quality)", "content": "Social media also contributes to sustainable cities by improving environmental monitoring mechanisms in sustainable smart cities. People frequently report environmental issues on social media platforms, such as air pollution and water quality in their locality. This could be used by the concerned public authorities and other organizations as real-time feedback. One of the key advantages of social media informatics is its ability to analyze large volumes of unstructured social media data, including posts and comments about different environmental issues. By doing so, it can detect emerging ecological risks and determine which areas need urgent attention. These reports can be examined to find patterns and regions that require attention [145]. Using technology to ensure sustainability, resource efficiency, and improved public health helps solve critical urban issues like water, waste, air, and traffic. A recent study in [32] used NLP to analyze geo-tagged Twitter data, finding increased negative feedback on indoor air quality in 2020 compared to 2019, emphasizing the importance of data-driven approaches for future indoor air quality management strategies. Combining social media data with conventional environmental sensors to create a more efficient monitoring system is covered in [74]. This study analyzes time series data from Patras, Greece, identifying seasonal patterns in reported urban issues, with peaks in summer, and forecasts a consistent rise in urban problems, offering insights for informed decision-making.\nThrough the integration of social media informatics and traditional environmental sensors, cities have the potential to develop a monitoring system that is both dynamic and responsive. To address climate change, overpopulation, and resource misuse, the study in [127] evaluates how a medium-sized city like Granada can transition into a smart city"}, {"title": "2.1.5 Public Safety and Emergency Response", "content": "Public safety and emergency response is one of the key aspects of sustainable cities. Like other applications, social media informatics can play a significant role in public safety and emergency response [21]. Social media allows the public and government to communicate in both directions, which is very important in emergencies. Responders may more precisely assess situations and direct resources where they are most needed by using citizen reports, location sharing, and firsthand information [90]. Authorities can promptly identify and respond to incidents, such as natural disasters, crimes, and other emergencies based on the real-time data supplied by residents. The literature indicates that social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are critical in sharing disaster alerts, organizing rescue efforts, and giving current information to the public during emergencies. For instance, real-time tweeting during natural disasters has been used to map damaged areas and effectively allocate resources [82]. Furthermore, social media informatics can uncover trends and anticipate probable crime hotspots, enabling preventative actions and heightened awareness in susceptible locations [45]. In addition to improving emergency response times, the capacity to quickly provide instructions and crowdsource information promotes community resilience and public safety system trust. In this regard, social media informatics can analyze citizen reports, geographical data, and firsthand information for practical insights, allowing for more accurate evaluation of situations and quicker response times [138]. For instance, social media informatics frameworks can examine live tweets in real-time during natural calamities to dynamically chart impacted regions and propose the most effective distribution of emergency supplies [4]. Moreover, it can identify patterns in social media data that could signify increasing tensions or the probability of criminal behavior. This enables law enforcement to proactively take measures and strengthen security in susceptible regions [124]. Guaranteeing timely and well-coordinated information and activities with the help of social media informatics enhances the efficiency of emergency responses and reinforces community resilience and public trust.\nHowever, the extraction of meaningful insights from social media posts is very challenging. For instance, social media posts must include geo-location information to obtain localized insights. Similarly, the posts must be detailed enough to extract meaningful insights into public safety and to respond accordingly."}, {"title": "2.1.6 Energy Management and Conservation", "content": "Energy management and conservation is one of the key aspects of sustainable cities.

Unlike other applications, the role of social media informatics in urban planning is slightly different. The literature reveals that broader adoption of social media informatics in urban planning and development requires effective use of social media platforms and proper integration of crowd-sourced data obtained from social media platforms with other sources to address urbanization challenges effectively [158]. These capabilities help urban planners and policymakers create more efficient and equitable cities. By incorporating public feedback into planning procedures, social media informatics can greatly assist urban planning and development [3]. Social media platforms facilitate the expression of residents' ideas regarding urban development projects, offering planners a range of perspectives and augmenting community engagement. The literature reports several cases where public feedback is used in smart city projects through social media informatics. For instance, Steinmetz et al. [162] used data-driven analysis to examine citizen engagement with Georges River Council's social media platforms for content analysis as a part of the smart cities project.\nUrban planning has the potential to go beyond conventional approaches by leveraging sophisticated algorithms to classify and give priority to community input, which can help guarantee that the perspectives of residents are not only acknowledged but also taken into account during the planning process [46]. Furthermore, social media informatics has the potential to enhance real-time analysis and adaptive planning, allowing cities to address evolving conditions and emerging challenges swiftly [20]. Social media informatics has the potential to address challenges like expensive costs and limited technical knowledge, thus facilitating the implementation of participatory planning processes even in resource-limited settings. Research has demonstrated how social media data can determine public preferences and concerns about zoning, infrastructure development, and land use [29]. However, practical implementation is often overlooked due to high costs, lack of political support, and insufficient technical expertise, as revealed through a case"}, {"title": "2.2 Social Media in Sustainable Societies", "content": "In the modern world, social media significantly impacts our society by directly or indirectly influencing our culture, sports, politics, and personal and collective lives [101]. The literature has identified several disadvantages and negative impacts of social media on our lives [31]. However, it also allows us to improve our lives by leveraging its widespread reach and interactive nature in different applications [42]. This could be used to track, analyze, and disseminate useful information and practical strategies, promoting sustainability. Thanks to the recent developments in AI, NLP, and multimedia analytics, several interesting applications of social media informatics have been introduced, providing a multifaceted approach to sustainable societies. These applications collectively foster environmental, political, economic, and societal well-being. In this section, we discuss some of the social media-enabled sustainability applications."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Information Dissemination", "content": "Over the last several years, social media has emerged as a faster, more accessible, and more interactive source of information dissemination [184]. Its widespread reach, worldwide accessibility, and instant access and updates are the key characteristics that make it a preferred choice for communication and information dissemination in different application domains [13]. The widespread use of popular social media outlets, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, expands the audience range by reaching beyond geographical bounds and making information accessible. More importantly, unlike conventional media, social media platforms have democratized information dissemination by allowing citizens (i.e., social media users) to share information. However, several challenges are associated with extracting useful information from social media. For instance, social media users generate a large volume of data containing noisy and irrelevant information on different platforms, making it very challenging to filter and analyze it for helpful information [28]. Similarly, the content is generated in various formats, including text, images, and videos as well as in different languages as social media users tend to post in their local languages. Moreover, social media text is subject to intentional and unintentional variations, resulting in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. These OOV words make text processing and analysis more challenging for certain applications, such as hate speech detection [87]. More importantly, misinformation and propaganda are the biggest challenges faced by social media as a source of information dissemination [153].\nHowever, to cope with the challenges associated with social media data, several interesting solutions have been proposed to ensure the quality of social media data. The literature reports several interesting texts, images, videos, and multi-modal classification frameworks for automatically filtering out irrelevant content [11]. For instance, Diaz et al. [63] proposed an NLP framework filtering Twitter data based on the credibility of Twitter users by processing their biographies. The solution is built on the hypothesis that expert and credible social media users share relevant content to an event/topic. Similarly several solutions have been proposed to deal with OOV words generated due to intentional and unintentional textual variations in social media text [47, 96]. For instance, \u00c1lvaro et al. [87] analyzed the impact of OOV words in different applications by generating OOV words in several languages, such as English, French, German,"}, {"title": "2.2.2 Social Sensing: Monitoring and Reporting", "content": "Social media, being a source of real-time monitoring, reporting, and feedback on different aspects of urban life, is also called a social sensor [83]. The basic idea behind the concept is leveraging user-generated content for meaningful insights and informed decisions in various social phenomena. The ability to generate and access content in real-time and its widespread use make it a preferred choice for crowd-sourcing to collect information from citizens on potential emerging societal and environmental issues [33]. The literature reports several situations where social media has been utilized to detect, monitor, and analyze public opinions, sentiments, behaviors, and feedback on different aspects of modern life. For instance, Ahmad et al. [9] explored the potential of social media as a crowd-sourcing tool and source of feedback on water quality. The authors also highlighted the limitations of conventional crowd-sourcing methods, such as online and paper-based surveys. Similarly, in [12] the authors analyzed social media data for real-time information on road conditions during and after floods.\nHowever, despite the great potential, several challenges are associated with opinion mining and crowd-sourcing with social media for critical applications. For instance, the analysis of large volumes of data, data quality, and other platform-specific issues, such as the limitations and complexities of the APIs. The biggest challenge in this application is the possibility of bias in the data. This challenge could be overcome by automatically analyzing social media data/information for potential biases through social media informatics using AI and NLP techniques. The literature already reports several interesting solutions for the detection of potential biases in social media data. For instance, Raza et al. [139] proposed an NLP framework, namely Dbias, enabling it to detect biased social media posts and identify and replace potentially biased words. Similarly, Mostatter et al. [120] employed several computational and statistical methods to assess social media posts for potential bias introduced due to the social media platforms' APIs (i.e., the way the information is collected). The authors also proposed several data collection strategies to minimize bias. Social media has big potential for understanding and responding to societal and environmental issues and could be a very effective tool for crowd-sourcing if the associated challenges are tackled properly."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Policy Impact Analysis and Evaluation", "content": "Social media could also be used as a tool for feedback, evaluation, and impact of the potential outcomes of policies by collecting real-time data from citizens. The citizens' feedback significantly impacts the policy-making process [155]. One of the key advantages of social media for feedback and evaluation of policies is the diversity in opinions from different age groups, socioeconomic status, and cultural and educational backgrounds. This diversity in social media users enhances the quality of the feedback, providing a more comprehensive and detailed view of the impact of the potential outcomes of policies. This feedback and opinions of people with a diverse background and expertise could lead to inclusive policies and decision-making processes [105], which is one of the objectives of sustainable societies. This inclusive policy-making process could lead to innovative solutions to different economic, environmental, and societal issues associated with the policies. Moreover, this feedback from the citizens and inclusive decision-making process builds trust in the citizens and policymakers, leading to better engagement and contributions from the community to sustainable cities and societies.

Social media possesses several key characteristics, such as worldwide accessibility and widespread use, interactive nature, and ability to engage large and diverse audiences, which make it a preferred choice for raising social awareness and conducting campaigns. Moreover, the freedom of sharing multi-modal content in terms of text, images, videos, and audio clips helps social media users create engaging and appealing content for social awareness and campaigns. Similarly, it also allows the opportunity to collaborate with social media influencers, benefiting from their popularity and large followings to amplify campaigns. The literature reports several studies where the large followings of social media influencers were used to amplify the campaigns [100]. Moreover, several social media platforms, such as Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram, also provide an opportunity for real-time engagement via live streaming and webinars.\nThe literature reports several successful social awareness campaigns through social media including public health and safety, environmental, political, heritage preservation, educational, and animal and human rights campaigns. For instance, Al-Dmour et al. [17] explored the potential of social media in public health campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing data from multiple social media platforms in Jordan. The authors reported a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 by building awareness and motivation for behavioral changes to cope with the pandemic. Similarly, Zamani et al. [192] utilized social media platforms and Augmented Reality (AR) technology for road safety awareness. To this aim, a questionnaire and AR advertisements on road safety were shared on Facebook, which were shared with more than 200,351 people and obtained 719,296 impressions and 3,218 clicks.

For instance, social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn could be used to discuss and gather ideas and potential solutions to various societal issues from a diverse audience [191]. The literature reports several studies on effective communication and sharing solutions for different issues [123]. For instance, Okonkwo et al. [125] explored the potential of social media as a source of communication, collaboration, and sharing solutions for potential challenges in businesses. Thomas et al. [174] analyzed and reported the importance and the effective role played by social media for collaboration within an organization. Considering the effectiveness of social media in collaboration and solution sharing, Governments, public authorities, and non-government organizations also rely on social media, seeking potential solutions and collaborations on different environmental and societal issues. For instance, The Spanish government used social media to engage citizens and public authorities in combating COVID-19 [60]. Similarly, the German and Estonian governments launched civic hackathons, seeking innovative potential solutions from the citizens for handling the COVID-19 crisis [60]. Social media platforms were also used for seeking internal and external collaborations and expert opinions on environmental challenges in Pakistan [167].\nSocial media platforms can also promote collaboration by facilitating the gathering of funds and resources for different projects, solving societal challenges [38]. These platforms possess several characteristics, facilitating fundraising in various ways [117]. For instance, its widespread use allows fundraisers to reach global audiences. Similarly, social media platforms support multi-modal data, allowing the creation of more appealing textual and visual content [81]. Similarly, several social media platforms, such as Facebook, support integrated and third-party fundraising tools, such as GoFundMe 2, and Patreon 3, facilitating the creation, and promotion of fundraising campaigns as well as tracking the progress. Several studies have reported the success of these fundraising tools in real-life fundraising campaigns for healthcare and treatment [141, 159] and disaster relief [137].\nHowever, despite the significant success, social media-based fundraising companies face several challenges. The biggest challenge to such campaigns is the trust and credibility issues. Social media is prone to scams and fraud that could make potential donors wary of contributing [194]. But, thanks to social media informatics, the detection of fraudulent fundraising campaigns is possible by deploying ML and NLP algorithms. The literature already reports the feasibility of such ML and NLP-based solutions for the detection of fraudulent fundraising campaigns. For instance,"}, {"title": "2.2.6 Transparency and Accountability", "content": "Social media possess several characteristics that make it a suitable tool for promoting transparency and accountability in different aspects of sustainable cities and societies [175]. For instance, real-time communication and instant access to information allow all stakeholders including public authorities, businesses, and non-profit organizations to share information, and provide updates on their policies, decision-making processes, and actions, promoting transparency. Similarly, the general public can give feedback and share their opinion on the services, facilities, policies, and their potential impact on the public and environment. The interactive nature of the communication provided by social media also allows organizations to respond to the citizens' feedback and highlight the changes made in response to the feedback [66]. Similarly, social media platforms facilitate crowd-sourced investigations and encourage citizens to investigate and verify information provided by the concerned authorities, businesses, and organizations [161]. The literature also reports on the effectiveness of social media as a medium for reporting potential corruption, fraud, or abuse of power cases [160].\nHowever, similar to the other applications, several challenges are associated with promoting transparency and accountability through social media. Firstly, social media is prone to misinformation and fake news, and the data shared on its different platforms must be verified [126]. Secondly, there is no accountability for social media users, and deliberate and coordinated campaigns could be launched to defame organizations or individuals by creating illusions and manipulating public opinions [16]. Moreover, considering the abundance of misinformation and fake news, a vast majority of citizens do not trust social media content, which could further hamper transparency and accountability efforts.\nThese challenges could be overcome with social media informatics algorithms. As discussed earlier, the literature reports several interesting solutions for disinformation and fake news propaganda detection in social media platforms. Similarly, the authenticity of shared documents could be proved through multimedia forensics. Multimedia forensics has been proven very effective in assessing the credibility of multimedia information shared in social media platforms [129]. Social media has great potential for promoting transparency and accountability, however, a multifaceted approach involving different stakeholders to combine technological solutions, regulatory/legal aspects, and community engagement strategies, is required to overcome the associated challenges."}, {"title": "2.2.7 Depression and Potential Suicide cases identification", "content": "Social media users, generally, tend to share their emotions by posting on social media, and these posts provide explicit and implicit cues including textual, visual, and contextual cues about their emotions and mental status. In terms of text, several words, such as \"happy\", \"excited\", \"angry\", \"frustrated\", and \"disappointed\", could hint at the mental state of social media users. Social media users also use text formatting (e.g., upper-case words) or punctuation to express the intensity of their emotions [134]. In visual content, cues for emotion detection include facial expressions, color combination, background color, different objects in the images/frame, body language, and situational context [183]. Several social media platforms support emojis, which social media users use to show their emotions [56]. These platforms provide emojis for positive and negative emotions, reflecting their sentiments, moods, and mental state.\nSocial media informatics allows the extraction of these cues of emotions and sentiments and predicts social media users' sentiments and mental states. The literature reports several interesting social media informatics algorithms and frameworks for predicting users' mental status from their posts [148]. These frameworks are useful in the early identification of potential depression and suicidal cases, allowing for timely intervention and support [108]. However, this requires continuous monitoring of individuals by analyzing the timing and frequency of their posts with explicit and implicit cues of emotions, and alerts to be generated when there is a sudden change in posting frequency during stressful times (e.g., a sudden increase in posts with negative emotions or lengthy inactivity).\nHowever, several technical and ethical challenges are associated with this continuous monitoring and data processing for depression detection. For instance, a fine balance between privacy and the need for data analysis needs to be defined to avoid the violation of the basic human right of privacy [70]. Moreover, it requires quality data and accurate interpretation of the context of the posts. The context of the posts is very critical in this application as the context in which certain textual, visual, and behavioral cues are used can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of depression and potential suicidal cases.\nThanks to the recent development in social media informatics, contextual information could be automatically extracted from the threads of social media posts. The literature reports several interesting frameworks for the identification of depression and potential suicidal cases in social media posts by considering the emotion cues and the context in which they occur [185]. For instance, Tejaswini et al. [171] proposed a hybrid deep learning neural network-based framework, composed of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, for combining the contextual information along the textual cues. The authors also employed several NLP techniques to clean and simplify the social media posts before processing them by dealing with OOV words. Thekkekara et al. [173] also employed a hybrid model with an attention mechanism on CNN-BiLSTM extracting contextual and linguistic features from social media posts to identify potential depression cases. To summarize, social media informatics has been proven very effective in the early detection of depression and potential suicide cases. However, human intervention and interpretation are crucial in this application, especially for contextual information and understanding of sarcasm, which are still very challenging tasks for social media informatics algorithms."}, {"title": "2.2.8 Crime Control", "content": "Crime control is another sustainable society application where social media plays its part. Social media informatics could be useful in crime control in several ways. On one side, it could be used by public authorities as a source of real-time monitoring, communication, dissemination of information about crimes, and generating alerts and warnings on a larger scale [133"}]}

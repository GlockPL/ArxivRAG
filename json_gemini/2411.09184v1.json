Introduction", "content": "Technology impact analysis\u2014defined as the impact of technology on society, particularly unintended, indirect, or delayed consequences, during its introduction, development, or modification\u2014is essential for technology management, enabling proactive identification and mitigation of potential risks (Ayres, 1969; Group, 2004; Lee et al., 2012). Earlier, expert-centric approaches, such as the Delphi method and scenario modeling, have been predominantly employed to generate forward-looking insights into the impact of technology (Lee, 2021). As the proliferation of technologies accelerates and innovation cycles shorten, these qualitative methods have been replaced by data-driven methods. In this context, patents have been regarded as valuable data sources because of their technical content, high quality, reliability, and accessibility (Ernst, 1997; Lee et al., 2020). Patent citation information is primarily used for technology impact analysis as it positively correlates with technological value (Arts and Veugelers, 2015; Harhoff et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2012; Trajtenberg, 1990b).\nPatent citation-based methods for technology impact analysis can be summarized as probabilistic and machine learning (ML)-based approaches. First, the probabilistic approach to technology impact analysis often uses curve-fitting techniques and stochastic models to project future trends by estimating the patent citation counts as quantitative indicators (Lee et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2013). However, because these methods require patents to accumulate citations over time, they typically highlight current key technologies rather than early stage innovations (Lee et al., 2018). In response, some researchers have developed ML-based approaches that utilize early patent information to predict citation counts, demonstrating the effective prediction of a patent's technological impact (Chung and Sohn, 2020; Hong et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2018). Nevertheless, considering that technology impact evolves over time and that there are interdependencies between impacts across different periods, where earlier impacts influence later ones and vice versa, the structure and design of existing ML-based approaches need to be improved (Ernst, 1997; Lee et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2017).\nAs a remedy, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach to enhance the understanding of the time-variant nature of technology impact and the interrelationships between impacts across different time periods. MTL is an ML approach in which multiple related tasks are learned simultaneously, sharing knowledge between tasks to improve overall performance. By applying MTL, we enhance the prediction performance of technology impact across different time periods through knowledge sharing while also tracking the evolution of technology impact over time. In particular, we address the following research questions: (1) Does the technology impact vary over time? (2) Does the impact of different time periods influence each other? (3) Why does the impact of technology change over time? At the core of our approach are (i) the quantitative definition and pattern identification of technology impact through citation analysis across different time periods; (ii) the design and development of an MTL model to predict citation counts from multiple patent indicators over time; and (iii) the interpretation of key input indicator shifts and patterns across time periods using the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method.\nWe applied the proposed approach to 10,851 patents in the field of battery technology. The case study demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective in understanding the dynamic nature of technology impact, as well as the interrelationships between technological impacts over different time periods. In addition, the use of SHAP analysis revealed that scientific knowledge of technologies is the most important feature for long- and short-term predictions, and has positive effects on breakthrough technology. To statistically validate the predictions, we compared the post-hoc patent value indicators of high- and lower-impact technologies, revealing significant differences in patent maintenance periods, technology transfer counts, and patent family size. We provided a practical implementation guideline combining natural language processing with our approach to present technology impact dynamics more clearly, identifying 22 battery sub-domains and revealing high-impact technologies, such as \u2018direct methanol fuel cells' and \u2018energy storage devices.' The proposed approach is expected to have academic implications as an initial attempt to understand the nature of the technology impact with MTL methods, and the systematic process and quantitative outcomes are anticipated to assist intellectual property management and R&D planning for practitioners.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the background of this study. Section 3 describes the proposed methodology, which is illustrated using the case study in Section 4. Section 5 presents the guidelines for validating and implementing the proposed approach. Finally, Section 6 addresses the limitations of this study and offers directions for future research."}, {"title": "2. Background", "content": "The impact of technology is generally assessed by the extent to which it serves as prior art for subsequent technological development (Arts and Veugelers, 2015; Harhoff et al., 1999; Trajtenberg, 1990b). Technologies with a strong impact are considered breakthroughs in value creation and growth (Arts and Veugelers, 2015; Briggs, 2015; Scherer and Harhoff, 2000; Schumpeter, 1942). The strategic importance of forecasting technological changes has become evident (Lee et al., 2012), and the key to technology forecasting is identifying the current technologies that will drive technological changes in the coming years (Porter, 1991; Watts and Porter, 1997). However, predicting the future impact of technology is challenging because of the complexity and uncertainty of the technological environment (Ayres, 1969). In this regard, patent data could provide quantitative methods for forecasting technology impact, as they contain credible and detailed information on technologies derived from a large number of patents (Lee, 2021).\nEarly attempts predicted the future impact of technologies by analyzing historical citation data and projecting future trends based on the estimated citation counts. Considering that technology impacts are unstable and dynamic, changing over time throughout their lifetime, unique to each technology (Lee et al., 2012), some researchers have adopted stochastic processes (Jang et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2016) and curve-fitting methods (Shin et al., 2013). A tenet of these studies is that shifts in patent information can track a technology's progression through its life cycle stages, and the relationship between the technology impact at different stages allows for predicting the individual technology impact of an invention. Despite the valuable contributions of previous studies in providing quantitative methods for predicting technology impacts, reliance on the accumulation of citation data limits their applicability when relevant inventions are in the early stages of technology development, without sufficient historical citation data (Lee et al., 2018).\nAs a remedy, ML-based methods have been suggested as predictive methods for technology impact analyses. In a pioneering study, Lee et al. (2018) the use of ML models to model the nonlinear relationships between quantitative patent indicators and patent citation counts, thereby allowing the identification of emerging technologies at an early stage. Similarly, Chung and Sohn (2020) suggested a multi-modal model using both textual information and quantitative patent indicators as inputs for predicting patent citation counts. Recently, Hong et al. (2022) enhanced the understanding of textual information for technology impact analysis by adopting convolutional neural networks for unstructured patent texts. These studies, despite making significant contributions to effectively expressing the technical characteristics of patents and modeling their technological impact, have overlooked certain aspects of the nature of technology impact, specifically, the time-variant nature of technological impact and the interrelationships between technological impacts over different time periods. Of course, some studies have taken multiple observation points for technology impact, but they have modeled these independently, failing to fully capture the characteristics of technology impact."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": "The overall process of the proposed approach involves four discrete steps (Figure 1): (1) data collection and preprocessing, (2) definition and extraction of patent indicators, (3) estimation of dynamic technology impact, and (4) model validation and result interpretation.\nOnce the target domain is defined, relevant patents can be collected from databases such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the Derwent Innovations Index. Patents contain both structured data, such as metadata, and unstructured data, such as abstracts and claim texts, and are typically provided in semi-structured formats, such as HTML or XML. These are parsed according to the data type and stored in the relational database. Key information in this database can be categorized into three main types: bibliographic information, textual information, and citation data. Bibliographic information includes patent registration numbers, filing/registration dates, and classification codes, which are used to systematically define the analysis periods and scopes. Textual information consists of titles, abstracts, and claims, which provide detailed descriptions of the technology and its scope of protection. Finally, citation data represent the technological dependencies between patents, and are primarily stored as an edge list between citing and cited patents.\nThis study employs multiple patent indicators that represent various technological characteristics and can be defined at the time of patent registration. Through an extensive literature review, we identified 44 quantitative indicators that are directly or potentially associated with the technology impact (Table 2). These indicators can be grouped into six categories, each offering a different perspective: (1) scope and coverage, (2) priority, (3) development effort and capabilities, (4) completeness, (5) technology environment, and (6) prior knowledge. Of the total, 28 are quantitative indicators and the remaining 16 are nominal variables measured for each technology field. Details of each indicator are described in Appendix A1.\nIn this step, MTL is employed to effectively handle the task of predicting time-variant technology impacts. By concurrently learning tasks with varying time horizons within a shared network, the model enhances generalization by capturing both task-specific and shared knowledge across tasks (Caruana, 1997). In our case, the MTL model can leverage the correlations between different time horizon technology impacts, reflecting the distinctiveness of each task. The MTL model can be designed as an input, shared, and task-specific layer (Figure 2). In the input layer, the model receives features that represent the technological characteristics of the individual patents. The shared layers capture the shared knowledge across tasks related to technology impact prediction over multiple time horizons. Finally, the task-specific layers learn knowledge tailored to each task and optimize the predictions for different time horizons.\nThe model predicts the technology impact level for each time horizon \\(T\\in \\{T_1, T_2, T_3, ...\\}\\), given the input patent. For each time horizon T, the model passes through the task-specific layer and outputs a logit \\(z_{T,i}\\) which represents the logit value for influence level i at time horizon T. These logits are then passed through a SoftMax function to convert them into probabilities for each technology impact level. Finally, the technology impact of each time horizon is determined by applying argmax to the probabilities and selecting the impact level with the highest probability (Equations 1-2). \\(f_{t,i}(p)\\) represents the probability that patent p belongs to technology impact level i at time horizon t;\n\\[f_{T,i}(p) = \\frac{exp(z_{T,i})}{\\Sigma_j exp(z_{T,j})} \\]\n\\[Impact \\ Level_t = arg \\ max \\ f_{T,i}(p)\\]\nThe shared and task-specific parameters are refined and optimized using backpropagation based on the loss function for each individual task (Equation 3). The model is trained to minimize the weighted loss for each task. \\(\\theta_{sh}\\) and \\(\\theta_{T_i}\\) represents the shared parameters and the task-specific parameters, respectively. \\(L_{T_i}, D_{T_i}\\) and \\(w_i\\) are the loss for each task, the dataset for each task, and the weight for each task's loss. The model learns parameters that minimize the weighted sum of losses across all the datasets.\n\\[\\min_{\\theta_{sh}, \\theta_{T_1}...\\theta_{T_n}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{T_i} * L_{T_i}(\\{\\theta_{sh}, \\theta_{T_i}\\}, D_{T_i})\\]\nIn this step, a comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted to identify the best-performing model using traditional performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. In our case, recall indicates how well the model identifies all patents of a grade, which is crucial for detecting important but less frequent grades, while precision shows the accuracy of the model's predictions for each grade, which is important for reducing false positives. The F1-score balances precision and recall, offering a single metric that accounts for both false positives and false negatives, and provides a fuller picture of the model's performance (Appendix A2). In addition, we employed two measures, the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), to address both class imbalance and overall classification quality. DOR evaluates the odds of a correct classification versus an incorrect one, providing insight into the model's ability to discriminate between classes, whereas MCC accounts for true and false positives and negatives, offering a balanced measure even in imbalanced datasets (Equations 4-5).\n\\[DOR_i = \\frac{TP_i \\times TN_i}{FP_i \\times FN_i}\\]\n\\[MCC_i = \\frac{TP_i \\times TN_i - FP_i \\times FN_i}{\\sqrt{(TP_i + FP_i)(TP_i + FN_i)(TN_i + FP_i)(TN_i + FN_i)}}\\]\nFollowing the performance evaluation, SHAP is employed to interpret the model results by analyzing patterns of technology impact shifts over time. SHAP enables a deeper analysis at the patent level, allowing patents to be grouped based on changing impact trends or time horizons. This facilitates the identification of key characteristics of technologies whose impacts increase or decrease over time. Rooted in cooperative game theory, SHAP attributes feature importance fairly, making it highly effective in uncovering common patterns across patent groups (Scott and Su-In, 2017). Its model-agnostic nature, along with specialized implementations, such as tree SHAP, kernel SHAP, and deep SHAP, makes it applicable to a wide range of ML models. By applying SHAP to our models, it would be possible to compare pivotal input features for short- and long-term technology impacts, thereby gaining valuable insights into the dynamics of technology impacts."}, {"title": "4. Empirical analysis and results", "content": "We conducted a case study of battery technology for three primary reasons. First, considering that battery technologies drive key industries, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy, technology forecasting helps prioritize investments and maintain competitiveness in these fast-growing sectors (Larcher and Tarascon, 2015). Second, as batteries are essential for clean energy transitions, identifying emerging technologies enables policymakers to support innovations that align with sustainability goals through funding and regulation (Kim et al., 2023). Finally, industrial stakeholders need scientifically grounded forecasts of battery technology advancements to optimize resource allocation, supply chains, and workforce planning, ensuring readiness for technological shifts. Failures in R&D decision-making can result in resource misallocation and delayed green innovation, hindering progress toward sustainability goals. A total of 10,851 patents classified under IPC code H01M and registered in the USPTO between 2006 and 2012 were collected.\nTo answer RQ1\u2014 whether the impact of a technology changes over time, indicating the presence of dynamic behavior\u2014 we tracked the number of citations received by patents over three time horizons: three, five, and ten years following their issuance. We found that the distribution of patents based on these forward citation counts was markedly right-skewed examining the temporal patterns of changes in technology impact ratings reveals the presence of intriguing patent groups, as illustrated in Figure 3 and Appendix A3. For instance, certain patents consistently receive citations over time, indicating their status as breakthrough technologies, while others show a gradual decline or increase in impact over time (Lee et al., 2017). We marked sustained-impact patents that continuously exerted significant influence and remained highly relevant over extended periods with blue lines. Peak-and-fade patents, which initially have a significant impact but subsequently diminish in relevance and influence, are represented by the \u2018yellow line.\u201d There are late-blooming patents\nIn RQ2, we examined whether shared parametric knowledge enhances the understanding of the time-variant technology impact. We developed MTL models using Keras for model development and optimization. Our MTL model comprises of shared and task-specific layers. The shared representation was learned through two fully connected layers with 128 and 64 units. Each task then branches into its own layers: Task 1 (short-term forecasting) employs two layers with 64 and 32 units; Task 2 (mid-term forecasting) has a single 64-unit layer; and Task 3 (long-term forecasting) uses two layers with 64 and 32 units. A total of 8,454 patents registered between 2006 and 2011 were utilized as the training set, whereas 2,397 patents registered in 2012 were reserved as the test set.\nWe explored the optimal architecture and hyperparameters with an exhaustive grid search using categorical cross-entropy loss as the loss function, SoftMax as the activation function, and a learning rate of 1e-3. Early stopping was implemented based on the aggregate validation loss across all the tasks. Batch training with a size of 32 and dropout rate of 0.5 was applied to the shared layers. Finally, the validity of the MTL models was investigated based on their ability to classify moderate, valuable, and breakthrough technologies, as shown in Tables 4 and A. 2. We evaluated the performance of the MTL models using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, with the sum of MCC scores across tasks serving as the performance evaluation metric to identify the best-performing model.\nWe examined the effect of sharing parametric knowledge on estimating the dynamic technology impact by comparing the performance of MTL models with that of single-task learning (STL) models (Table 5). The hyperparameters of each STL model were optimized using a grid search. Overall, the STL models exhibited lower performance than the MTL model across most metrics. In particular, it is noteworthy that the ability to identify valuable or breakthrough technologies in the mid-term is enhanced in MTL models compared to STL models. For moderate technologies in mid-term forecasting, the STL model achieved a precision of 0.8769 and an MCC of 0.2087, which decreased by 0.0075 and 0.0285, respectively, compared with the MTL model. For breakthrough technologies, the STL model showed a recall of 0.1449, F1-score of 0.2, and MCC of 0.2011. Compared to the MTL model, which achieved 0.2609, 0.3214, and 0.3151, the STL model scores were lower by 0.1160, 0.1214, and 0.1140, respectively.\nSimilar trends were observed in the short- and long-term forecasting (Table A. 3). The improved performance in identifying breakthrough and valuable technologies suggests that MTL helps mitigate the bias of STL models, which tend to be biased towards moderate technology predictions (Table A. 4). For short- and long-term forecasting, the STL model showed a higher performance in identifying moderate technologies. The overall MCC of the MTL model was higher than that of the STL model across all time horizons. The largest performance gap between the two models is observed in the mid-term time horizon. In short-term forecasting, the small difference in citation counts between classes may make it challenging for both STL and MTL models to learn effectively. In the case of long-term forecasting, a sufficient difference in citation counts between classes could explain the smaller performance gap between the STL and MTL models.\nTo answer RQ3, we investigated whether variables with a significant impact on the estimation of the dynamic technology impact change over time using SHAP analysis. Specifically, we employed Deep SHAP (Chen et al., 2021; Scott and Su-In, 2017), considering the modular structure of our models and computational complexity. For each time horizon, we identified the most important features with high global SHAP values for the breakthrough technologies (Figure 4).\nFor short-term forecasting, scientific knowledge, technological recombination, and dependency on homogeneous technologies exhibit high SHAP values. For mid-term forecasting, the growth speed, technological breadth, and technology recombination showed high SHAP values for breakthrough technologies. For long-term forecasting, technological breadth, scientific knowledge, and the international priority range exhibited high SHAP values. The high impact of the international priority range suggests that having priority patents distributed across various countries is closely related to the validity of the patent, which in turn is associated with its long-term impact. In the mid-term, growth speed shows a notable influence, and referencing foundational technologies that have been in use for a long time tends to be related to higher technology impact. Summary plots for each task's BT prediction are presented in Figures A. 1, A. 2, and A. 3.\nAlthough technology recombination and technological breadth exhibited high SHAP values in the short- and long-term predictions, a relationship between the magnitude of these variables and BT predictions was not clearly observed. In contrast, higher scientific knowledge had a stronger influence on BT predictions for both the long- and short-term. For long-term BT predictions, higher prior knowledge had a positive influence. For mid-term predictions, a broader international priority range had a lower influence on BT predictions. Similar to other time horizons, higher scientific knowledge had a positive influence. In addition, while technology breadth had high SHAP values, its relationship with BT predictions was not clearly identified."}, {"title": "5. Discussion", "content": "To statistically validate our predictions, we examined whether the breakthrough technologies we identified exhibited higher post-hoc technology value metrics than those with lower impact. Three patent quality indicators, patent maintenance period, technology transfer count, and patent family size, were selected and extracted (Appendix A4). For each forecasting horizon, we investigated whether our predicted result\u2013the technology impact\u2013is correlated with other patent quality indicators. Jonckheere\u2013Terpstra test was adopted to examine whether the rankings of the median quality indicators among the three technology impact classes were statistically significant (Table 6). A statistically significant trend was observed in the rankings of patent quality indicators across all time horizons. The technology impact classes demonstrated statistically significant ordinal trends for the three key indicators over the three horizons. Notably, technology transfer count and patent family size exhibited highly significant trends in all periods (p-value = 0.0000), while patent lifetime also showed significant trends with p-values of 0.0243 (short-term), 0.0169 (mid-term), and 0.0022 (long-term).\nThe proposed approach provides analysis results at the individual patent level; however, when combined with natural language processing techniques, it enables the derivation of interpretable technology impact scores across specific technical fields. We applied topic modeling techniques, including BERTopic, to analyze patent abstract texts, thereby identifying 22 distinct subdomains in battery technologies (Table A. 5). To assess the future impact of each topic, we analyzed the annual technology impact scores of the patents (Table 7). Excluding 2008, when \u2018direct methanol fuel cells' had the highest impact, \u2018energy storage devices' consistently demonstrated the highest average technological impact. Technology fields, such as 'fuel cell bipolar plates,' 'fuel cell stack design,' and 'fuel cell sealing components', consistently show low technological impact. In contrast, technological fields such as 'electrochemical cell components,\u201d \u2018fuel cell catalysts,' and \u2018alkaline storage batteries' show growth trends."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "This study proposed an MTL approach to enhance the understanding of the time-variant nature of technology impacts and the interrelationships between impacts across different time periods. The central tenet of this research is that capturing the dynamics of technology impacts enhances the prediction of time-variant impacts. Through a case study in the field of battery technology, we confirm that impact ratings can vary over time. By applying MTL, we enhanced the performance by improving the understanding of the dynamics of the technology impacts. In addition, through SHAP analysis, we investigated whether input features have a significant impact on the dynamic technology impact, which changes over time.\nThis study contributes to both academia and industry in several ways. From an academic perspective, this study is a pioneering attempt to use MTL to consider the relationships between impacts across different time horizons at the early stage of patent registration. We demonstrated the potential of MTL in technology impact analysis and contributed to the precision of potential technology indicators by enabling predictions of future technology impact over time. From a practical perspective, the proposed method can assist in decision-making for intellectual property management. Forecasting the time-variant technology impact enables the development of detailed strategies, such as licensing agreements, technology transfer, technology valuation, and patent maintenance. In addition, this approach aids in identifying emerging technology areas and supporting R&D decisions by adjusting plans based on whether an emerging area has long-term or short-term impact potential.\nDespite the effectiveness of the proposed approach, this study had several limitations. First, additional input features, such as textual information, can be incorporated to enhance the technological understanding of patented inventions (Hong et al., 2022). Moreover, network-based indicators that capture a patent's characteristics from a broader perspective can be incorporated in terms of the technological ecosystem (Choi et al., 2023). Second, long-term predictions are challenging for newly issued patents, as they are less than 10 years old, and thus have insufficient citation data. Because MTL allows the use of different datasets for each task, future research could explore long-term predictions using older patents and short-term predictions using recent patents. Finally, the proposed approach currently relies only on forward citation counts as a proxy for technological value. Future work could incorporate additional indicators, such as technology transaction data (Kim et al., 2022; Ko et al., 2019) and patent maintenance (Choi et al., 2020), within the MTL framework to enhance the multifaceted understanding of different technology value indicator."}, {"title": "Appendix", "content": "In this study", "groups": "scope and coverage", "inventions": "grant time lag and specificity of the technical summary. The interval between a patent's filing and issuance dates, representing the patent examination period, can be used as an indicator of grant time lag. A longer examination period may reflect significant stakeholder efforts to strengthen the patent, potentially suggesting a higher technological value or complexity (Hikkerova et al., 2014). The specificity of the technical summary is measured by the word count of the patent's abstract, which includes the core aspects of the invention. The level of detail can indicate the scope or value of the patent, with more specific descriptions often reflecting broader or more valuable claims.\nFive environmental indicators were used, as the technological environment may relate to patent maintenance and R&D strategies (Choi et al., 2023; Trappey et al., 2012). To account for the activity of technology fields, the average number of patents issued annually in the relevant technology fields was utilized. Similarly, the average number of cumulative patents issued in the relevant technology fields is used to quantify the size of the technology fields (Lai and Che, 2009). In addition, the average number of applicants issuing patents by issuance year in the relevant technology fields is utilized to reflect the competitiveness of the technology fields (Fabry et al., 2006). The frequency of IPC codes at the section level was used to reflect the technology fields in the system. The growth speed indicator is determined by measuring the median time gap between the filing dates of prior and current patents, referred to as the technology cycle time (Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996; Kayal and Waters, 1999). This reflects the pace at which innovation progresses within the relevant technology field.\nFor prior knowledge, ten measures were employed. The number of non-patent citations is employed to represent the scientific knowledge of an invention because a stronger scientific basis is often linked to more innovative and influential technologies (Cozzens et al., 2010; Rotolo et al., 2015; Trajtenberg, 1990a). To measure the prior knowledge of inventors and assignees, the average number of patents they have previously been involved in is used, reflecting their experience and its impact on patent value. Core and peripheral knowledge are assessed based on the assignee's prior activities (Harhoff et al., 1999), either within the same technological area (core) or other fields (peripheral) (Seol et al., 2023), representing the accumulated knowledge that reflects both technological and commercial focus (Chung et al., 2021; Meyer, 2006). Many studies have proposed that the novelty of a technology arises from the recombination and synthesis of existing technologies (Fleming and Sorenson, 2001; Lee and Lee, 2019). Owing to the complexity of calculating all IPC combinations for all patents in the relevant IPC codes (Kwon and Geum, 2020), the technology recombination of the invention is measured as the ratio of the IPC codes, which is the recombination of the IPC from prior patents. The number of technological classes a patent cites can be used as a proxy measure of technological value (Kwon and Geum, 2020; Shane, 2001; Verhoeven et al., 2016). Technological breadth refers to the diversity of IPC codes associated with patents and prior patents. This reflects how broad the technological scope of a patent is (Choi and Yoon, 2022). In this study, technological breadth was modified and calculated as the number of technological classes of patent sites. Dependency on homogeneous technologies is calculated by counting the number of patents cited within the same battery technology field, reflecting the extent to which the invention relies on closely related prior technologies. Prior knowledge was represented by the number of backward citations.\nInitially, class-specific accuracy and overall average accuracy are computed (Equations 6-7).\n\\[Accuracy_i = \\frac{TP_i+TN_i}{TP_i+TN_i+FP_i+FN_i}\\", "frac{\\Sigma_{i=1}^{l}((TP_i+TN_i)/(TP_i+TN_i+FP_i+FN_i))}{l}\\": "nIn this context, the terms true positive (\\(TP_i\\)), true negative (\\(TN_i\\)), false positive (\\(FP_i\\)), and false negative (\\(FN_i\\)) for a given class i represent correctly predicted positives, correctly predicted negatives, negatives wrongly predicted as positives, and positives wrongly predicted as negatives, respectively. The total number of classes is denoted by l. In a multi-class classification problem, accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified patents. However, it can be misleading in imbalanced datasets, where certain grades dominate, and high accuracy may mask poor performance on less frequent classes. Therefore, although accuracy is a useful overall metric, it should be complemented with precision, recall, and F1-score for a complete assessment (Equations 8-10).\n\\[Precision_i = \\frac{TP_i}{TP_i+FP_i}\\", "frac{TP_i}{TP_i+FN_i}\\": "n\\[F1 \\ - \\ score_i = \\frac{2TP_i}{2TP_i+FP_i+FN_i}\\"}]}

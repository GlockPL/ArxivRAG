De-\nspite advances in supportive treatments, the in-hospital mor-\ntality rate remains 40% for conditions such as acute lung\ninjury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [Rubenfeld\net al., 2005; Sweatt and Levitt, 2014]. Managing respira-\ntory distress involves intricate treatment measures, includ-\ning invasive mechanical ventilation [Esteban et al., 2000],\nnon-invasive mechanical ventilation [Esquinas et al., 2017],\nand high-flow nasal cannula [Frat et al., 2017]. However,\nexisting recommendations and outcomes, especially regard-\ning intubation and weaning procedures for ICU patients, re-\nmain controversial and poorly understood [Zuo et al., 2020;\nPapoutsi et al., 2021; Suo et al., 2021; Wanis et al., 2023;\nKondrup et al., 2023].\nHealth disparities are widespread within marginalized\ncommunities, particularly across respiratory diseases, acting\nas significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in the\nUnited States [Schraufnagel et al., 2013; Moy et al., 2017;\nThakur et al., 2014]. These communities, facing systemic\nbarriers and social inequalities, bear a disproportionate bur-\nden of adverse health outcomes due to factors such as eco-\nnomic instability, limited access to education, and housing\ninsecurity [Purnell et al., 2016]. Recognizing and evaluat-\ning social determinants of health (SDOH) is important for ad-\ndressing the complex factors that influence the quality of and\naccess to healthcare [Holmes Fee et al., 2023; Bundy et al.,\n2023; Lua et al., 2023; Marmot, 2005; Nakagawa et al., 2023;\nMoukheiber et al., 2024a]. A comprehensive understanding\nof SDOH can offer insight into potential disparities that might\nbe overlooked within studies focused solely on traditional at-\ntributes such as age, race, gender, and health insurance, mak-\ning it important for the evaluation of algorithmic bias [Celi et\nal., 2022; Nazer et al., 2023].\nObservational health data, derived from EHRs, presents a\nvaluable resource with the potential to enhance healthcare.\nAlthough efforts have been made to establish benchmarks\nfor EHR data [Harutyunyan et al., 2019; Purushotham et\nal., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2022; Rocheteau\net al., 2021], these benchmarks primarily focus on conven-\ntional clinical prediction tasks, such as mortality and length-\nof-stay predictions. To the best of our knowledge, the cur-\nrent benchmark datasets lack dynamic aspects of pulmonary\nfunction, encompassing complex respiratory treatment strate-\ngies, ventilator settings, and pulmonary mechanics, along\nwith other clinically-relevant variables for guiding decision-\nmaking. Furthermore, current ICU benchmark datasets of-\nten lack a link to SDOH, which limits the ability to fully un-\nderstand and address the complexities influencing the recom-\nmendations for intubation and weaning in ICU patients. The\nrecently released MIMIC-IV dataset, linked to SDOH fea-\ntures based on patient zip code [Yang et al., 2023], enables\ndetailed fairness assessments of SDOH dimensions. There-\nfore, we use MIMIC-IV to benchmark clinical respiratory in-\ntervention tasks for ICU patients.\nIn this work, we benchmark two time-dependent clinically-\nmotivated prediction tasks, including successful weaning and\nprolonged mechanical ventilation. We further evaluate the\ndifferences in performance gaps across protected attributes,\nincluding age, gender, race, and English proficiency, as well\nas eight SDOH features. We also release a dataset with hourly"}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "2.1 DataSet\nDataset Overview\nWe introduce a temporal benchmark for clinical respira-\ntory interventions, a 90-day hourly ventilation dataset de-\nrived from MIMIC-IV version 2.2. MIMIC-IV is an\nopen-access, de-identified database compiled from electronic\nhealth records of patients admitted to the ICU or Emergency\nDepartment at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in\nBoston between 2008 and 2019. Our temporal data includes\nconfounding variables categorized into static and dynamic\nvariables. Figurel depicts hourly characteristics for a single\npatient's ICU stay over 30 days.\nCohort Selection\nIn the MIMIC-IV database, a patient can have multiple stays\nin the ICU over the years or experience transitions between\ndifferent ICUs during the same hospital admission. To pre-\nvent data leakage and maintain data integrity, we choose the\nfirst ICU stay with respiratory support for each patient. This\napproach ensures that data used for modeling is independent\nand not influenced by information from subsequent stays.\nFurthermore, patients without resuscitation or intubation di-\nrectives and those who were on invasive ventilation 24 hours\nbefore admission to the ICU are excluded, resulting in a total\nof 50,920 patients.\nData Extraction and Preprocessing\nMost timestamps for the variables that vary over time in the\nraw MIMIC data are presented in the year, month, day, hour,\nminute, and second format, offering the potential to derive\ngranular data for comprehensive medical analysis. The spo-\nradic recording of multiple observations allows us to aggre-\ngate the data into hourly bins to improve the data density and\nanalytical consistency. Our dataset spans the period of 0 to\n2160 hours (equivalent to 90 days) following ICU admission\nfor each subject.\nPatient-level Static Variables\nThe static parameters extracted the patients, as described in\nTable 1, include variables such as ICU admission and dis-\ncharge, sex, type of insurance, language proficiency, mari-\ntal status, together with clinical details including the patient's\nfirst ICU type, predicted body weight in kilograms, height in\ninches, and the Elixhauser-Van score a measure of comor-\nbidity.\nMeasurement Observations\nThe time-varying measurements in the data encompass ven-\ntilation settings, laboratory results, and vital signs, as well\nas comorbidity scores that evaluate neurological function (in-\ncluding the Glasgow Coma Scale), along with an assessment\nof patient organ dysfunction (Sequential Organ Failure As-\nsessment score). Ventilation settings and vital signs are ex-\ntracted from the MIMIC chartevents table, while labs data\nare obtained from the MIMIC labevents table, each identi-\nfied by their respective ItemIDs. To handle multiple values\nwithin a single hour for a subject, we aggregate the results\nby computing the median, as the median exhibits reduced\nsensitivity to noisy data. The labs are sourced from arte-\nrial blood gas (ABG) specimens, as arterial blood measure-\nments are deemed to have greater clinical relevance and pre-\ncision when evaluating parameters such as respiratory func-\ntion, acid-base balance, and oxygenation status. Two pa-\nrameters derived from ventilation settings are also presented:\nset_pc_draeger (set pressure for pressure-controlled ventila-\ntion from the Draeger ventilator) and set_pc (set pressure for\npressure-controlled ventilation). Set_pc_draeger is calculated\nas the difference between the inspiratory pressure from the\nDraeger ventilator (pinsp_draeger) and the set peak inspira-\ntory pressure (ppeak). Based on clinical knowledge, set_pc\nis populated with pcv_level (pressure controlled ventilation\nlevel) if present, pinsp_hamilton (inspiratory pressure from\nHamilton ventilator) if pcv_level is absent, and set_pc_draeger\n(inspiratory pressure from Draeger ventilator) if both are ab-\nsent. All variables related to ventilation parameters, vital\nsigns, and labs, and their corresponding descriptions, are de-\nscribed in Table 2.\nTreatment Interventions\nThree respiratory support methods, including invasive venti-\nlation (INV), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and high-flow\nnasal cannula (HFNC), are presented as binary indicators per\nhour. The curation of these respiratory support variables is\nverified by clinical experts to ensure accuracy and reliabil-\nity. In MIMIC, the procedureevents table identifies patients\non INV or NIV during their ICU stay, while the chartevents\ntable identifies patients on HFNC. INV and NIV in MIMIC\nhave documented start and end times recorded by respiratory\ntherapists, however, HFNC lacks a corresponding time inter-\nval; having only the time at which the measurement was ob-\nserved. Therefore, we pre-process the data to establish a start"}, {"title": "Fairness Audits Along SDOH & Demographic\nAttributes", "content": "We perform fairness audits by considering protected at-\ntributes, such as race, age, and gender, along with eight\nSDOH attributes. This provides deeper insights into the pa-\ntient population beyond conventional demographic attributes.\nWe utilize the MIMIC-IV census tract-level SDOH data to\nconduct fairness audits on our benchmark tasks [Yang et al.,\n2023]. Our analysis includes investigating the differences in\nfairness across subgroups based on SDOH attributes, such as\nwhether a patient resides in areas with high employment rates,\nhas a high reliance on public assistance or food stamps, lives\nclose to healthcare facilities, engages frequently in heavy\ndrinking or smoking, has high student expenditure, resides\nin homes with high electricity heating and lives in areas with\nfew deaths from firearms.\nWe assess the performance of downstream classifiers based\non three definitions of fairness, including, demographic par-\nity (parity gap), equality of opportunity for the positive class\n(recall gap), and equality of opportunity for the negative class\n(specificity gap) [Chen et al., 2019]. We follow methods used\nin prior work to expand the demographic parity gap [Zhang et\nal., 2020; Hashimoto et al., 2018], and use a similar process\nto obtain the recall, and specificity gaps. These evaluations\nare conducted on the best-performing model for both tasks."}, {"title": "3 Results & Discussion", "content": "3.1 Benchmark Tasks\nThe AUROC for both prolonged mechanical ventilation and\nweaning are shown in Table 5.

It is particularly relevant\nin clinical settings where minimizing false negatives is crucial\nfor timely effective patient diagnosis. To analyze variations\nin model performance among continuous SDOH attributes,\nwe discretize the attributes into two quantiles. A positive re-\ncall gap suggests that the model favors the low prevalence of\nthe specified SDOH attribute over the high prevalence. For\ncategorical variables like gender, race, age, and English pro-\nficiency, a positive recall gap indicates that the model favors\nmales, whites, non-elderly individuals, or English speakers\nover their respective counterparts.\nIn Figure 3a, for the task of predicting prolonged mechan-\nical ventilation the model favors individuals who reside in ar-\neas with high employment rate, have a high reliance on pub-\nlic assistance or food stamps, are close to a medical-surgical\nICU, rarely engage in heavy drinking or smoking, have high\nstudent expenditure, reside in homes with high electricity\nheating, and live in areas with few deaths from firearms.\nAdditionally, as seen in Figure 3b the model favors certain\ndemographic groups, including females, non-white individu-\nals, younger individuals, and non-English speakers.

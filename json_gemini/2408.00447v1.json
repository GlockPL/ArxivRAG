Yet, navigating through the highly scattered knowledge from unfamiliar disciplines poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce DiscipLink, a novel interactive system that facilitates collaboration between researchers and large language models (LLMs) in interdisciplinary information seeking (IIS). Based on users' topic of interest, DiscipLink initiates exploratory questions from the perspectives of possible relevant fields of study, and users can further tailor these questions. DiscipLink then supports users in searching and screening papers under selected questions by automatically expanding queries with disciplinary-specific terminologies, extracting themes from retrieved papers, and highlighting the connections between papers and questions. Our evaluation, comprising a within-subject comparative experiment and an open-ended exploratory study, reveals that DiscipLink can effectively support researchers in breaking down disciplinary boundaries and integrating scattered knowledge in diverse fields.

However, there is a growing trend towards adopting interdisciplinary approaches to research, especially for complex, real-world problems [72]. Although forming research teams composed of experts from various fields is one preferred way of carrying out interdisciplinary studies, resource constraints and budget limitations sometimes make it impractical to establish such teams [9]. Researchers trained in one discipline often have to independently seek out information from the literature from various, maybe unfamiliar, research fields to develop their project ideas and approaches, a process we refer to as interdisciplinary information seeking (IIS) in this paper. However, this process is challenging for several reasons. First, relevant literature to an interdisciplinary project is often highly scattered in various weak-connected research areas [6, 47]. It often requires multiple iterations for researchers to identify what to search [20, 52]. Second, different disciplines use different terminologies, which becomes an obstacle for researchers to form accurate queries for searching literature in their unfamiliar fields [20, 48, 66]. Also, interdisciplinary researchers face the challenge of interpreting vast amounts of information from various unfamiliar fields and evaluating the relevance to their interests during the search [20, 52].\nWhile prior human-computer interaction (HCI) work has proposed various approaches for seeking scholarly information, few of them are targeted at the needs of IIS. For example, when a computer science researcher is looking to find existing work on computational approaches to combat misinformation, existing literature search tools can facilitate the search by expanding on citations and references [16, 29, 33], iterating search keywords [17], or tracking key actor activities [32]. However, when the researcher is curious about what knowledge in sociology and education, in particular, can be blended into research on this topic, these tools provide limited guidance within the vast search space."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the key processes and challenges of interdisciplinary information seeking. Then, we discuss the existing systems that support the literature review. Lastly, we discuss existing human-AI collaboration research on information-seeking and sensemaking."}, {"title": "2.1 Interdisciplinary Information Seeking (IIS)", "content": "Interdisciplinary research involves integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to address research problems [18, 72]. A critical component of this type of research is interdisciplinary information seeking (IIS), the process of gathering relevant information across various fields. Compared with normal scholarly information seeking, IIS is typically more complex and time-consuming due to its highly dynamic process [20, 66].\nFoster [20] describe IIS through a nonlinear model comprising three main stages: orientation, opening, and consolidation, which are often intertwined during the IIS process (see Figure 1). Orientation involves researchers determining their search direction. The key challenge in orientation is the highly-scattered nature of the necessary knowledge for an interdisciplinary project [6, 20, 48, 52]. Researchers aim to construct an interdisciplinary knowledge picture for their projects, yet they cannot be experts in every field. Consequently, they often seek out resources, including experts, to discern relevant knowledge [34]. In the absence of such guidance, they have to rely on their own general knowledge and intuition to determine the disciplines from which to gather information [20, 52]. This approach, however, introduces considerable uncertainty into their search process. Furthermore, researchers often need to revisit their search goals based on insights from the opening and consolidation stages, adding to the time required for IIS [20].\nOpening is the stage where researchers explore literature in their chosen search directions. Interdisciplinary researchers tend to deliberately increase the breadth of their search and maintain an open-minded attitude towards all encountered information, considering it potentially valuable [20]. This approach is driven by the necessity to gather widely dispersed knowledge inherent to IIS. A significant challenge in this stage is the terminology gap: researchers often struggle to craft queries that use appropriate terminologies to effectively bridge their research interests with literature from unfamiliar disciplines [6, 52]. Previous work suggests that terminology may \u201chave a different meaning\u201d [48], and \u201cnot always appropriate or transferable\u201d [20] across disciplines. Researchers might not be able to immediately find the papers for the search direction they identified in orientation due to the terminology gap. Thus, they typically need to gradually accumulate their knowledge in unfamiliar fields and iterative refining search terms to uncover relevant literature [66].\nConsolidation is the stage where researchers decide whether and how to include found papers in their projects, typically following the Opening and Orientation stages. Two primary challenges emerge during consolidation. First, the Opening stage results in the accumulation of a large volume of information, much of which may be irrelevant noise, thereby imposing a significant information load on researchers [48, 52]. Second, the found papers have their own contexts in their belonging disciplines, and to sift, verify, and incorporate the found papers, the interdisciplinary researcher must make sense of the connection between the found papers and their own project This task is challenging for researchers who are not accustomed to reading literature from unfamiliar fields [52, 66].\nIn summary, IIS is challenging because of the highly scattered relevant knowledge, terminology gap, information load, and the difficulty in identifying relevant papers. These challenges identified by prior work motivate our system design (see section 3)."}, {"title": "2.2 Interactive Systems Supporting Literature Review", "content": "Getting a comprehensive understanding of prior works is generally challenging for researchers [11, 56]. Although survey papers synthesizing previous works into themes are commonly used by researchers to grasp fields [27], it is uncertain whether existing surveys can effectively cover all fields and capture rapidly emerging research topics. To overcome the obstacles associated with literature reviews, some studies have aimed to simplify the process of digesting research papers [15, 24], while others have focused on aiding researchers in compiling relevant literature through mechanisms like citation networks [29, 30, 70] and identification of key authors [32].\nSpecifically, Kang et al. [33] outline two primary strategies employed by prior interactive tools to assist researchers in synthesizing literature reviews from extensive bodies of work: the bottom-up approach, which supports researchers in developing key themes through improved navigation at the paper level, as seen in tools like Threddy [29] and Apolo [16], and the top-down approach, which offers an overarching view of the literature, exemplified by Metro Maps [59]. Building on these concepts, Kang et al. [33] propose for a mixed-initiative approach that combines clustering papers via citation networks to provide an overview for researchers while also allowing them to customize this overview from the bottom up. Inspired by Kang et al. [33], our system incorporates a mixed-initiative workflow once a collection of relevant papers has been assembled. But differently, our design focuses on a more expansive search process across various disciplines to meet the unique demands of IIS. Therefore, the system we propose takes users' descriptions of their research interests as input, instead of using seed papers as in Kang et al. [33]'s work. Moreover, we specifically tailor the discovery and synthesis workflow to preserve the link between discovered papers and the user's contexts, considering the potential diverge between them in IIS.\nPrevious studies have also endeavored to enable researchers to uncover relevant knowledge from other disciplines, such as developing analogical literature search engines that facilitate the discovery of papers from distant fields sharing similar research aims [13, 31], directions or challenges [35]. Nevertheless, the analogical search has a clear goal in performing literature-based discovery [64, 68, 69] to uncover solutions that could be transferred for solving the target research problem Kang et al. [31]. Differently, our work targets a more expansive search process (i.e., IIS), and focuses on supporting researchers oriented to relevant research in various disciplines. Additionally, Shi et al. [62] introduce a visual analytics system designed to automatically collate and synthesize research data from several disciplines, aiding in the selection of research directions"}, {"title": "2.3 Al-powered Information Seeking and Sensemaking", "content": "Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to develop Al systems aimed at enhancing information-seeking and sensemaking activities. For instance, Qiu et al. [55] introduced DocFlow, a visual analytics system that facilitates document retrieval and categorization through natural language questions within the biomedical field. Palani et al. [51] design in-context positioning of query suggestions and found it improves the exploratory search process.\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has positioned them as potential knowledge bases for information retrieval [2, 81]. There is a growing body of research focused on refining the user experience in sourcing information from LLMs. For example, Suh et al. [67] argue that the typical linear conversational workflow found in many LLM-based tools falls short in aiding users to synthesize and comprehend information generated by LLMs. To address this, they advocate for the adoption of interactive hierarchical views to enrich information interaction practices. Jiang et al. [28] present a novel approach by organizing LLM responses into interactive graph-based diagrams, thereby streamlining the process for users to pinpoint the information they need.\nWhile LLMs in the above works mainly serve by directly generating answers for information seekers, hallucination remains a significant issue. To address this, some research focuses on using LLMs to extract and summarize information from search results. Selenite, an LLM-powered system recently proposed by Liu et al. [40], employs LLMs to generate comprehensive overviews of options and criteria grounded in search results, guiding users through complex decisions. Recent emerging works also see opportunities to leverage potential hallucinated LLM generations. For example, Gao et al. [22] use LLMs to generate \u201chypothetical documents\" for input queries to improve dense retrieval. Similarly, Son et al. [65] utilize LLM generation for visual search, but to help users better express their intents and refine their searches. Lee et al. [37] connect retrieved papers with users' existing collections using LLMs, which may include hallucinations, to aid in sensemaking. They found that in their design, hallucinations had minimal negative impacts. In our work, we also explore how potentially hallucinated generations can support information seeking. We use LLMs to produce high-level exploratory questions, instead of facts, from various disciplinary perspectives. These questions enable users to co-explore with LLMs. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to aggregate discipline-specific terminology by generating pseudo-answers, thereby expanding search queries with relevant terminologies to help users bridge terminology gaps in IIS."}, {"title": "3 DESIGN GOALS", "content": "Drawing on insights from prior research on interdisciplinary information seeking (refer to subsection 2.1) and reflections from our design iterations (detailed in the supplementary material), we have identified four design goals (DG) essential for designing a human-Al collaborative system to aid in IIS.\nDG1 Support orienting the exploration in various disciplines. Engaging in interdisciplinary research often necessitates acquiring knowledge from various disciplines, which challenges researchers in determining relevant search areas in unfamiliar fields [6, 20, 48, 52]. Although LLMs can assist researchers in delving into topics across various disciplines, their tendency to generate hallucinations may lead to confusion. Additionally, prior studies [20, 58] and our preliminary design experiments underscore the importance of maintaining high self-agency for researchers who prefer to be actively involved in the exploration process. Accordingly, the system should not solely provide answers for IIS with LLMs but should utilize LLMs as a knowledge resource, guiding users in their exploration and enabling a collaborative exploration experience.\nDG2 Support formulating search queries with domain-specific terminologies. Formulating effective search queries, especially with terminology spanning multiple fields, poses a significant challenge for researchers in IIS [48, 52]. This often involves iterative refinement of search keywords, informed by ongoing discoveries from the literature [20]. Given that LLMs excel in linking concepts and generating diverse query sets [75, 76], the system should leverage LLMs to assist users in crafting queries, thereby saving time and enhancing search efficiency.\nDG3 Organize retrieved papers around exploration focus. The sheer volume of papers encountered in IIS can overwhelm researchers [20, 48]. Moreover, search results often include irrelevant noises that detract from the exploration focus, as revealed in our design iterations. Previous HCI research suggests the aggregation of similar information and providing overviews is helpful in such cases to alleviate user burden [16, 33, 54]. Therefore, the system should categorize retrieved papers into overviews, enabling users to swiftly pinpoint relevant groups of literature.\nDG4 Provide Information Scent for Efficient Paper Sifting. In the IIS process, researchers often need to meticulously review papers to verify their relevance to specific aspects of their research [20, 52]. This labor-intensive task necessitates a mechanism for quickly identifying relevant information within papers. To facilitate this process, the system should highlight critical paper details and offer \"information scents\u201d that guide researchers in their review process [53]."}, {"title": "4 THE DISCIPLINK SYSTEM", "content": "We introduce DiscipLink, a human-Al collaborative system designed to enhance interdisciplinary information seeking (IIS). Unlike previous efforts in scholarly information seeking, DiscipLink focuses on enabling researchers to effectively collaborate with LLMs for broader exploration across disciplines, thereby linking their own projects with diverse knowledge.\nGenerally, inspired by prior research [26, 33], DiscipLink facilitates both top-down and bottom-up mixed-initiative literature discovery workflows (Figure 2). In the top-down workflow, users decide the exploration direction they are interested in first, avoiding being lost in the details of a number of papers. To aid this process, DiscipLink generates diverse EQs from various disciplines based on the user's research topic (Figure 2-1), crafts comprehensive queries for each EQ (Figure 2-2), and summarizes key themes from retrieved papers to streamline screening (Figure 2-3). On the other hand, the bottom-up approach empowers users to spontaneously navigate through papers, citations, and references. Users can organize the papers of interest and formulate new EQs based on these papers, thereby starting new research directions. DiscipLink enhances this exploration by organizing citations and references based on user exploration history and suggesting EQs informed by user-selected papers.\nAs a research prototype, DiscipLink uses GPT-4 as the underlying LLM, Semantic Scholar API service for searching papers, and \"text-embedding-3-small\" OpenAI [49] for text embedding. The subsequent subsections detail a usage scenario and describe DiscipLink's key features in addressing our design goals."}, {"title": "4.1 Usage Scenario", "content": "Zoey, a computer science researcher, is tackling a new project aimed at raising awareness about social media misinformation among older adults. While she possesses expertise in misinformation detection through natural language processing, she finds herself stumped by the challenges older adults face in navigating social media and the human factors influencing misinformation awareness. To bridge these gaps, Zoey turns her attention to unfamiliar disciplines like sociology and psychology for insights. Beginning with search terms such as \"older adults misinformation,\" through Google Scholar, she finds a mountain of papers that seem relevant across disciplines, including education, sociology, and psychology, each offering unique perspectives on the subject. Determined not to miss out on anything potentially useful, Zoey digs into each paper, one by one.\nHowever, the scattered insights across different fields make her research feel like assembling a vast puzzle without a guiding image. Moreover, she needs to understand different perspectives during her search, each requiring a shift in mindset. Struggling to manage the information overload and the constant shifts in disciplinary perspectives, Zoey considers seeking help from DiscipLink.\nUpon describing her research project to DiscipLink, Zoey receives a list of exploratory questions (EQs) organized by specific disciplines. Zoey is particularly interested in the perspectives of psychology, education, and sociology. These EQs, framed with easy-to-understand language, introduce some key factors, such as \"What can older adults be motivated to learn digital literacy?\" (education), \"What cognitive strategies reduce belief in false information?\" (psychology), that has never come to her mind before, possibly due to her unfamiliarity with these disciplines. Among these, the EQ \"How effective are peer-led education programs for seniors?\" catches her interest. However, aiming to align it more closely with her focus on misinformation, she refines it to \"How can peer-led education programs combat misinformation among older adults.\"\nAfter tailoring several EQs across psychology, education, and sociology to her preferences, Zoey prompts DiscipLink to fetch relevant papers. After searching, DiscipLink organizes the findings into themes for each selected EQ in the Exploration view (Figure 3-middle). Delving into the search results on cognitive strategies to counter misinformation, Zoey discovers themes such as \"Critical Thinking and Cognitive Improvement\" and \"Inoculation and Over-confidence Strategies to Combat Misinformation\". This overview allows her to navigate the themes without getting bogged down in the details of individual papers. Attracted by the concept of \"psychological inoculation,\u201d, a term new to her, she explores a linked wiki page, uncovering its relevance in preemptively addressing misinformation. Through annotated key phrases in paper titles"}, {"title": "4.2 System Design", "content": "4.2.1 [DG1] Elicit Exploration across Disciplines. To support users in expanding their exploration to relevant information scattered in various academic fields (DG1), DiscipLink encapsulates potential literature search objectives into interactive elements named exploratory questions (EQs). In other words, DiscipLink proposes EQs from different disciplines' perspectives to elicit users' breath exploration. For example, when exploring a research topic of facilitating older adults to learn about AI tools, possible EQs could be \"what cognitive challenges older adults may face in understanding complex concepts?", "how to design interactive tools to support learning for older adults\", which is more related to HCI literature. Below, we introduce the enabled interactions around EQs in DiscipLink, the design rationale, and the EQ-generation process.\nSupported Interactions around Exploratory Questions. Upon users entering a research topic (Figure 3-A1), DiscipLink generates a list of EQs tailored to the research topic of interest. In this process, we leverage the inherited knowledge of LLMs derived from its large-scale training data to ensure the coverage of diverse disciplines. Users have the flexibility to modify their topic description anytime, prompting DiscipLink to produce new EQs based on the updated description or to initiate a new exploration session by resetting the current ones (Figure 3-A2). The EQs are categorized by their relevant disciplines (Figure 3-D1), with a navigation bar allowing users to easily filter EQs by research field (Figure 3-B). By selecting EQs, users can specify their exploration intentions for DiscipLink to identify literature closely aligned with their interests. Further interactions include editing EQs (Figure 3-D2), adding or removing selected EQs (Figure 3-C1), and generating additional EQs by specifying disciplines and particular needs or by manually entering questions (Figure 3-C2).\nNote that if users encounter an interesting paper on a yet-to-be-explored topic, they can obtain new EQs from DiscipLink based on the paper by dragging it from the exploration or collection view to the orientation view. Users have the option to pinpoint specific aspects of a paper, such as particular keywords, that pique their interest. Upon specifying these details, they can direct DiscipLink to suggest new EQs tailored to these focal points. We set DiscipLink to provide three new EQs each time. Users can choose one or several EQs to refine or opt to craft new EQs from scratch. Once these EQs are finalized and submitted, DiscipLink initiates a new round of search for papers concerning these EQs immediately.\nDesign Rational. Our design of EQs draws inspiration from human-centered design principles, including the creation of a shared representation to balance automation with user agency [25], and the reification of actions into objects for direct manipulation [7]. EQs act as a bridge between users and the system, offering an intuitive means for users to convey their interests and for DiscipLink to interpret and further translate these interests into complex queries, thereby fetching a broad spectrum of relevant papers. We have explored other forms of LLM assistance in the design process for guiding and expanding user exploration in IIS. Initially, our prototype leveraged LLMs to generate research topic statements for users. However, this approach led to two main issues: the topics often contained inaccuracies due to LLM hallucinations, and they served more as end products of exploration instead of inspirations for users to explore. Another alternative we considered was utilizing LLMs to generate simple queries, similar to those users might input into search engines like Google Scholar. This method, while straightforward, can be inefficient in IIS. Effective queries for IIS necessitate the use of discipline-specific terminology, which could be challenging for users to understand. To address the problems in the above two methods, EQs in DiscipLink are framed as questions rather than facts, aiming to expand the exploration space, and users can flexibly customize EQs to co-explore with LLMs. Also, EQs are crafted in user-friendly language as a high-level abstraction of research directions over low-level typical search queries.\nPrompts Design. DiscipLink takes two main types of inputs from users to generate EQs: the research topic of interest and/or the paper of interest, as illustrated in Figure 4. To generate EQs from diverse disciplinary perspectives based on these seeds of exploration, we employ prompt-chaining and persona-prompting techniques [78, 79].\nThe process involves chaining prompts to guide LLMs in generating EQs. More specifically, given a research topic, we provide the list of disciplines used by Semantic Scholar for LLMs to determine which of them might be relevant. The list includes primary disciplines, such as \u201ccomputer science": "nd", "psychology": "LLMs then determines specific subfields within these disciplines (e.g.,"}, {"psychology": "that closely align with the topic of interest, enabling it to propose more targeted questions. Then, for each identified field and subfield, our prompt to LLMs begins with, \"You are an expert in field. A researcher is developing a research topic: topic. What knowledge from your field could assist in developing this idea? Present your advice in the form of questions.\u201d After collecting EQs across different disciplines, we instruct LLMs to refine this list by removing any duplicates, resulting in the final EQs shared with users.\nPreliminary experiments indicate that adopting specific expert personas enables LLMs to produce questions that closely match the disciplinary focus. For instance, when exploring how AI tools can support older adults learning in science without employing"}, {"title": "4.2.2 [DG2] Query Expansion to Retrieve Relevant Papers", "content": "When users express interest in a particular EQ, DiscipLink furthers the exploration by expansively generating numerous queries related to the EQ. Next, it conducts searches for papers in Semantic Scholar using these queries concurrently. In EQ generation, we guide LLMs to employ straightforward, easy-to-understand language so that users can quickly decide whether to dive into an EQ or not. However, when it comes to searching for papers, we instruct LLMs to use precise terminology and field-specific jargon relevant to the EQ to craft the search queries. This aims to fill the terminology gap of IIS introduced in subsection 2.1. Moreover, we intend to retrieve a diverse set of papers using the output queries to allow DiscipLink"}, {"title": "4.2.3 [DG3] Organize the Retrieved Papers of around EQs", "content": "It is challenging for users to go through the extensive papers retrieved from the queries, especially considering that many papers are likely from unfamiliar fields of study. To alleviate this information overload, DiscipLink distills key themes from the papers, focusing on the connection to the user's current exploration context (i.e., the research topic and the selected exploratory question).\nThemes Extraction. While the papers retrieved from the expansive queries could contain many themes, users would be more interested in those more related to their current exploration context, i.e., the research topic and the selected EQ. A LLM-based clustering pipeline (Figure 6) is deployed to sift through papers and extract themes pertinent to the user's interests. Several LLM-based clustering techniques have been proposed by researchers, while trade-offs exist. For example, LLooM [36] and ClusterLLM [82] produce high-quality clusters but need to operate at the data instance level - LLooM involves distilling info from each input data instance and ClusterLLM uses triplet comparisons - leading to increased time costs. To balance quality and time costs and enable interactive theme exploration in DiscipLink, our pipeline begins by generating contextualized embeddings for papers, proceeds to cluster these embeddings, and concludes with LLMs refining the clustering outcomes.\nIn the first step, we are inspired by the keyphrase expansion technique proposed by Viswanathan et al. [74] to construct the contextualized paper embedding. This technique concatenates original text embedding with keyphrase embedding related to user intents. Similarly, in DiscipLink, the contextualized embedding comprises text embedding of the paper's metadata (title and abstract) and embeddings of the paper's discipline, if matching the EQ's discipline, as well as key phrases from the paper's metadata resonating with the research topic and EQ. By considering whether the paper's discipline matches the EQ's discipline in the paper embedding, we add a soft constraint on clustering papers that fall into the same field of study. To identify relevant phrases from academic papers, we first convert key concepts $C = {C_1, C_2, ..., C_m}$ from the research topic and EQs, along with phrases $P = {P_1, P_2, ..., P_n}$ from the paper's metadata, into embeddings. A phrase $p_i$ is considered relevant if its cosine similarity with any concept $c_j$, defined as $sim(v_{c_j}, v_{p_i}) > 0.6$, surpasses a predetermined threshold of 0.6 6.\nIn the clustering phase, we employ DBSCAN [57] to group the contextualized embeddings. While, through constructing the contextualized embeddings, the algorithm is more likely to put papers relevant to the exploration context together, it can produce other clusters less related to the contexts. Besides, the resulting clusters might still have many papers that making it challenging for users to quickly screen them. To this end, we harness LLMs to curate the clustering results. Specifically, we prompt LLMs with two questions for each cluster: \"Is this cluster related to the research topic and the selected question?\" and \"Is there a clear division between papers that a subclustering would be helpful?\" Based on the results, we remove irrelevant clusters and decide whether to divide any existing clusters further. We still keep the papers under the removed clusters in a \"possibly relevant paper\u201d list in DiscipLink for participants to browse if they want. This design decision is driven by the observation that researchers would not only search on purpose but also be interested in serendipitous information discovery [20].\nSupported Interactions. Upon selecting an EQ for which papers have already been queried, DiscipLink presents the extracted research themes. It displays the disciplinary distribution and key phrases for papers within each theme (Figure 3-E) and links the key phrases to their respective wiki pages via DBPedia Spotlight [44] when possible.

Moreover, before each task started, we asked participants to tell us what they planned to search for during the task. Subsequently, upon completion of the assigned task, we directed the participants to provide ratings indicating the extent to which they identified relevant literature they had planned to search, as well as the degree to which they discovered relevant literature that had not been part of their initial search strategy. These ratings help to assess whether DiscipLink achieves the goal of expanding researchers' exploration scope. For the expert ratings, we recruited two experts to score the outlines.

Participants exhibited a significantly higher task workload in the baseline conditions based on the averaging score of the NASA TLX items (M=4.01, SD=0.74) compared to the system condition (M=2.93, SD=0.97, p<0.01). For the individual items (illustrated in Figure 7), the system condition is significantly better than the baseline condition in regard to the physical demands (p=0.01), performance (p=0.03), effort (p=0.02), and frustration (p=0.04). These results suggest that DiscipLink improves participants' search efficiency, lowers their workload, and helps them effectively learn more in the IIS process.\n5.4.3 [RQ3] User experience. Participants generally held positive attitudes towards the usefulness, ease of use, ease of learning, and workflow compatibility, as shown in Figure 8. Most participants appreciated the generated EQs. P12 noted that \u201cWhen I came to this new field, I didn't know where to go and how to search on Google. There might be some terms in this field, and then it [DiscipLink ] could help me ask some questions. It is difficult for me to ask professional questions in this way.\u201d\nNevertheless, some participants complained that DiscipLink provides too many EQs and thus adds load to users: \u201cIt has many [EQ] recommendations, and I may still need some efforts to screen them. I need more time to see if this is relevant, and it is unlikely to be completed very well in a relatively short time.\u201d (P06). P07 expects the EQs to be better connected, "}]}

{"title": "Transforming Social Science Research with Transfer Learning: Social Science Survey Data Integration with AI", "authors": ["Ali Amini"], "abstract": "Large-N nationally representative surveys, which have profoundly shaped American politics scholarship, represent related but distinct domains a key condition for transfer learning applications. These surveys are related through their shared demographic, party identification, and ideological variables, yet differ in that individual surveys often lack specific policy preference questions that researchers require. Our study introduces a novel application of transfer learning (TF) to address these gaps, marking the first systematic use of TF paradigms in the context of survey data. Specifically, models pre-trained on the Cooperative Election Study (CES) dataset are fine-tuned to reuse in the American National Election Studies (ANES) dataset, prediction policy question base on demographic variables. Even with a naive architecture, our transfer learning approach achieves about 92% accuracy in predicting missing variables across surveys, demonstrating the robust potential of this method. Beyond this specific application, our paper argues that transfer learning is a promising framework for maximizing the utility of existing survey data. I argue that artificial intelligence, particularly transfer learning, opens new frontiers in social science methodology by enabling systematic knowledge transfer between well-administered surveys that share common variables but differ in their outcome of interests.", "sections": [{"title": "Transforming Social Science Research with a New Aspect of AI", "content": "In January 2024, the president of the Society for Political Methodology sent an email to list serve stating, 66 We are increasingly receiving papers at Political Analysis (PA) that engage with AI & GPT, an emerging area of excitement for our field\", highlighting an unprecedented surge in AI and GPT-related submissions. The email also emphasized the need for reviewers to evaluate this growing body of research (Society for Political Methodology). This excitement, which I witnessed firsthand as a data editor and internal reviewer at Political Analysis, centered on large language models (LLMs), a subset of AI, particularly regarding their potential to replace traditional human sampling (Grossmann et al., 2023; Aher, Arriaga and Kalai, 2023; Argyle et al., 2023). However, this excitement, while fostering an active research agenda, is now encountering significant pushback. Scholarly discourse has introduced critical caveats and critiques (Pilati, Munk and Venturini, 2024), demonstrating that \u201csubstitution proposals\" for LLMs instead of human participants ignore and ultimately conflict with foundational values of working with human participants: representation, inclusion, and understanding (Agnew et al., 2024). I argue that although the political methodology community is currently concentrating on AI primarily through the lens of large language models, it is both possible and imperative to investigate another transformative facet of AI, such as transfer learning. This approach harnesses authentic human data while simultaneously capitalizing on advancements in AI and computational capabilities, thereby advancing research in political science and the broader domain of social science. This paper introduces and advocates for a novel research agenda for the \"transformation of social science research\" that moves beyond the current LLM-centric discourse to explore the transformative potential of transfer learning in social science survey research.

Whether one believes voting behavior is best explained by Party ID, as in the Michigan model (Campbell et al., 1960), or by sociological contexts, as in the Columbia model (Berelson, Lazarsfeld and McPhee, 1954), nationally representative surveys have remained constant in political behavior inquiries. Large-N surveys like the American National Election Studies (ANES) and the Cooperative Election Study (CES) provide core understanding into the American electorate, offering foundations for developing and testing political behavior theories (?). However, these surveys have traditionally been used in isolation, with students of American politics conducting regression analyses on individual datasets. I argue that artificial intelligence techniques, specifically transfer learning, can bridge these separate survey datasets, creating unprecedented opportunities for testing new hypotheses about American political behavior. The United States, as the world's richest and oldest continuous democracy, uniquely benefits from numerous high-quality time-series surveys with large sample sizes and comprehensive question batteries. These surveys, designed and administered by leading academic institutions, share core demographic variables (related domains) but differ significantly in their policy questions (different domains). This combination of shared and distinct characteristics makes these surveys ideal candidates for transfer learning. Transfer learning (TL) involves pre-training a model on a large (source) dataset and fine-tuning it on a smaller (target) dataset to optimize performance (Taylor and Stone, 2009; Pan and Yang, 2010; Zhao et al., 2024). While conventional transfer learning application has been applied in other areas of social science such as computer vision (Torres and Cant\u00fa, 2022), annotating data in large language models (LLMs) (Laurer et al., 2024), and detecting deep-fake tweets (Khalid et al., 2024)\u2014it has not yet been utilized for survey data. This makes our study the first to explore the potential of transfer learning in bridging data gaps across political science surveys, offering a novel approach to addressing long-standing data fragmentation challenges."}, {"title": null, "content": "Political behavior models have been profoundly shaped by survey research, particularly in demonstrating the explanatory power of demographic variables (Bartels, 2000; Levendusky, 2009). Moreover, research on 'sorting' further underscores the significance of these demographic predictors. Bishop (2008) demonstrates how Americans increasingly cluster into politically homogeneous communities, a trend that accelerates partisan alignment: Democrats and Republicans systematically relocate to areas consistent with their political views (Gimpel and Hui, 2015; Sussell, 2013). This ideological sorting is evident in both symbolic ideology (self-identified liberal-conservative placement) and operational ideology (specific policy positions), which have become increasingly correlated with partisan identity (Fiorina, Abrams and Pope, 2011; Hetherington, 2009; Weber and Klar, 2019). Polarization, in its various forms, also has become integral to understanding American politics (Abramowitz and Saunders, 2008; Benson, 2024; Iyengar et al., 2019; Hetherington, 2009). While polarization and sorting pose challenges for democratic theory by intensifying partisan divides, they also create unique AI opportunities for knowledge transfer between datasets. The increased alignment of political attitudes and behaviors with demographic variables enhances their predictive power, making demographic features more robust anchors for imputing missing policy preferences through transfer learning. This combination of polarization and sorting presents unique opportunities for leveraging knowledge transfer between datasets. The increased alignment of political attitudes and behaviors with demographic variables enhances their predictive power, making demographic features robust anchors for imputing missing policy preferences through transfer learning. It is important to note that this paper does not merely advocate for a specific application of TL in ANES and CES data; it establishes a new research agenda. I argue that scholars can and must see survey data with common"}, {"title": null, "content": "domains (shared variables) but related tasks (prediction) as opportunities for transfer learning. It is also important to differentiate the data produced in this study from recent attempts to use AI-generated synthetic data. Studies exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) to simulate human survey responses have introduced new concepts like algorithmic fidelity. For instance, Argyle et al. (2023) demonstrated that GPT-3 can generate \"silicon samples\" by conditioning on detailed demographic backstories to approximate public opinion within specific subpopulations. However, these models fall short in capturing higher-order relationships and the statistical precision required for rigorous political analysis. As highlighted by Bisbee et al. (2024), LLM-generated data often displays significant inconsistencies in regression coefficients and sensitivity to prompt variations, raising concerns about their reproducibility and validity. Specifically, 48% of coefficients derived from ChatGPT responses significantly diverged from those obtained via ANES data, with 32% exhibiting directional changes in effect size. Moreover, LLM-generated responses frequently fail basic replication tests, with distributions varying substantially between tests conducted in April and July 2023 due to algorithmic updates. In contrast, our work employs a data-driven and interpretable methodology validated through standard linear regression techniques. Rather than creating synthetic personas, I apply transfer learning to leverage large, representative datasets such as ANES, CES, and Pew surveys to infer the political behavior of specific respondents. Each student of American Politics knows that a straight, religious, 60-year-old Republican conservative male without a college education in Indiana is likely to vote for Trump or hold pro-life views. I argue that this intuition can be systematically taught to machines via reusing large datasets' pre-trained models. This approach ensures empirical validity by making sense in terms of demographic from observed data. Unlike probabilistic outputs from large language models"}, {"title": null, "content": "(LLMs), our method refines and extends the utility of existing datasets, offering a robust and replicable framework for understanding political behavior. This distinction underscores a fundamental shift in focus from generating new, synthetic data to transferring empirical knowledge between established survey datasets through computational innovation. Transfer learning is a machine learning \"paradigm\" that leverages previously trained models for a different but related task (Chao et al., 2023; Pan and Yang, 2010). A canonical example of transfer learning is in driving: experienced passenger vehicle operators typically demonstrate accelerated acquisition of commercial transport skills. This transfer of domain knowledge to a different but related task shows how expertise in a source domain (passenger vehicle operation) can expedite mastery of a related target domain (commercial transport), despite differences in vehicle scale and operational complexity. As illustrated in Figure 1, the ANES and CES datasets share a common domain, characterized by high predictive power for variables such as party identification (PID), demographic attributes, and ideology. However, they lack policy-specific questions that could serve as additional predictors. I propose that a model pre-trained on an outcome variable like \"Vote for Trump\" using CES data (the source dataset) can be fine-tuned for application on ANES data (the target dataset)."}, {"title": "Transferrer Learning Paradigm", "content": "To evaluate the reliability of this approach in predicting policy preferences, a ground truth is necessary. Thus, Iselected two outcome variables available in both datasets, as depicted in Figure 1. These variables serve as benchmarks for validating the transfer learning framework.

These"}, {"title": "Linear Model: Interpretative Rationale of using Transferrer Learning in Survey Data", "content": "The linear regression model is more than a simple statistical technique it is the fundamental architectural framework and logic underlying sophisticated deep learning approaches: Even in black box neural networks, where the coefficients and values within internal layers lack interpretability, the ultimate significance lies in the final output. Neural networks can be broadly conceptualized as a two-stage regression or classification model. Therefore, I used the linear model as the first test of my approach. If the data sets are nationally representative and if there is predictive power on key demographic variables, I expect that when I transfer the model from the Cooperative Election Study (CES) data to the American National Election Studies (ANES), I will observe relatively consistent coefficients, in terms of size and sign. To put it differently, the linear regression model serves as a critical first test of cross-survey data prediction, grounded in two fundamental assumptions: \u2022 National Representativeness: Both the Cooperative Election Study (CES) and American National Election Studies (ANES) are designed to provide statistically representative samples of the U.S. population. \u2022 Demographic Predictive Power: Key demographic variables should exhibit stable predictive power across different survey.

This outcome shows that while our transfer learning is effective, it performs better for tasks involving binary outcomes like \"Vote for Trump.\" As a result, I expect to see better performance for deep learning base transfer learning as well."}, {"title": "Results and Discussion", "content": "Our initial transfer learning model for \"Vote for Trump\" shows strong predictive power even without addressing missing data or implementing more sophisticated deep learning architecture. The model achieved 91.98% accuracy on the ANES test set, with a recall of 93.89% and precision of 88.28%. These impressive metrics with a naive model highlight the promising potential of utilizing transfer learning in survey research. These results validate our theoretical framework regarding the relationship between political polarization, sorting and demographic predictability. The high accuracy shows that demographic variables have indeed become reliable predictors of political behavior across survey domains, supporting existing literature on political sorting and polarization (Bishop, 2008; Hetherington, 2009). The balanced F1 score of 91.00% further suggests that these relationships are stable enough to enable reliable cross-survey prediction."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "While the field of political methodology has been excited by artificial intelligence advances, particularly large language models (LLMs), this narrow focus risks overlooking other transformative AI approaches.

The success of transfer learning in this context suggests broad applications across political science and the social sciences more broadly. This approach could help researchers leverage insights across disparate datasets, maximize the utility of existing survey data, and generate more robust cross-survey comparisons. The innovative core of this approach lies in recognizing that surveys with common domains (e.g., shared demographic variables) but different tasks (e.g., varying policy questions) offer untapped opportunities for knowledge transfer. Just as transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as computer vision and natural language processing by facilitating knowledge reuse across related tasks, it holds transformative potential for leveraging existing survey data across diverse research contexts. The initial results for a nivve model (accuracy of 91.98% and F1 score of 91.00%) show the promising potential of transfer learning in survey research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with individual-level prediction accuracy and their synthetic data generation approaches can undermine core principles of human participant research namely representation, inclusion, and understanding - transfer learning shows remarkable capability in preserving and leveraging actual participant responses (Agnew et al., 2024). The strong performance of our basic implementation, even without sophisticated optimization, suggests substantial room for further advancement through more refined approaches. Future research could extend this framework to diverse contexts, including international survey programs, longitudinal studies, and specialized surveys that share common variables but differ in their specific focus areas. More advanced applications could incorporate sophisticated techniques for handling missing data and leverage complex modeling architectures.

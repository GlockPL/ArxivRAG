Literature Review", "content": "Urban mobility faces multifaceted challenges, including traf-\nfic congestion, environmental pollution, inefficiencies in pub-\nlic transportation, and the pressures of increasing urbanization.\nTraditional solutions have often proved inadequate, prompting\na shift towards innovative technologies like Artificial Intelli-\ngence (AI) to address these issues comprehensively.\nTraffic congestion significantly impacts economies both di-\nrectly and indirectly. Sweet (2011) demonstrates that conges-\ntion leads to immediate costs such as travel delays and unre-\nliable travel times, which reduce productivity as workers and\ngoods take longer to reach their destinations. While travelers\nmay adapt by altering routes, travel times, or modes of trans-\nportation, the overall economic costs remain substantial. More-\nover, congestion influences broader economic geographies by\naffecting where businesses and residents choose to locate, often\nredistributing rather than eliminating economic growth. Public-\nsector efforts to mitigate congestion through road expansion\nhave been costly and largely ineffective, leading experts to ad-\nvocate for adaptation strategies over mitigation Sweet (2011).\nEnvironmental pollution is another critical issue linked to\ntransportation systems. Jacyna et al. (2017) highlight that trans-\nportation, particularly road transport, is a major contributor\nto environmental pollution through emissions of harmful com-\npounds like carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), par-\nticulate matter (PM), and hydrocarbons (HC). These pollutants\nadversely affect human health and the environment. Addition-\nally, noise pollution from transportation has become a serious\npublic health concern, causing sleep disturbances, cardiovas-\ncular diseases, and stress among urban populations. Efforts to\nmitigate these negative effects focus on reducing emissions and\nnoise levels through technological advancements in vehicles,\ntraffic management strategies, and the development of sustain-\nable transportation systems (Jacyna et al., 2017).\nInefficiencies in public transportation systems exacerbate ur-\nban mobility challenges. Boil\u00e9 (2001) identifies technical and\nscale inefficiencies as primary issues affecting transit systems'\nperformance and resource utilization. Technical inefficiencies\narise from suboptimal use of resources such as labor, fuel, and\nmaintenance, while scale inefficiencies occur when the size of\nthe transit operation leads to overcapacity or underutilization.\nUsing data envelopment analysis (DEA), studies have assessed\nand compared the efficiency of various transit systems, pin-\npointing areas where improvements can optimize operations.\nAddressing these inefficiencies can enhance service delivery,\nreduce operational costs, and increase the sustainability of ur-\nban transportation networks Boil\u00e9 (2001).\nThe rapid pace of urbanization and increasing population\ndensity significantly impact energy consumption and efficiency\nin cities, particularly concerning transportation systems. He et\nal. (2023) note that urbanization concentrates population and\neconomic activities, escalating the demand for transportation\nand energy. While densely populated areas can benefit from\nthe agglomeration effect\u2014where resources are used more ef-\nficiently due to proximity-overpopulation can lead to con-\ngestion and inefficiencies. Cities with inadequate transporta-\ntion infrastructure face greater challenges, as increased de-\nmand for travel between dispersed urban sub-centers results in\nlonger commuting times, more vehicle use, and higher energy\nconsumption. Efficient public transportation systems in well-\nplanned urban areas can mitigate these negative effects, improv-\ning energy efficiency and reducing pollution. Thus, urban plan-\nning strategies that balance density with adequate infrastructure\nare crucial in addressing the challenges posed by increasing ur-\nbanization He et al. (2023).\nTraditional policy interventions like congestion pricing have\nbeen implemented to reduce traffic congestion but possess in-\nherent limitations. Cheng et al. (2024) discuss how congestion\npricing, which involves charging drivers for road usage dur-\ning peak times, aims to decrease the number of vehicles on the\nroad and alleviate congestion. While cities like London, Stock-\nholm, and Singapore have reported significant traffic reductions\nwhen congestion pricing is paired with public transport im-\nprovements, these policies can have unintended consequences.\nTraffic may shift to non-charged periods or alternative routes\noutside the charging zone, and wealthier drivers may continue\nto use the roads while lower-income individuals face restricted\naccess. The success of congestion pricing largely depends on\ncomplementary measures, such as enhanced public transit op-\ntions, to sustain long-term benefits Cheng et al. (2024).\nIn response to these challenges, AI technologies have\nemerged as promising tools to revolutionize urban mobility,\nparticularly within the context of smart city development. Lu-\nusua et al. (2023) explore how AI-powered systems are in-\ntegrated into various aspects of transportation, including au-\ntonomous vehicles, traffic management, and urban planning.\nAdaptive algorithms optimize routes, manage congestion, and\nenhance public transportation efficiency. Technologies like\ncomputer vision, machine learning, and AI-driven analytics an-\nalyze data from urban mobility systems, geographic informa-\ntion systems (GIS), and surveillance networks to create sophis-\nticated models of city traffic and behavior. AI applications\nin autonomous driving and traffic automation are pivotal for\nthe future of urban mobility, promising to reduce human error\nand streamline transportation systems. However, implementing\nthese technologies raises ethical questions regarding privacy,\nsurveillance, and accessibility, necessitating thoughtful and in-\nclusive approaches to integrating AI into urban mobility sys-\ntems Luusua et al. (2023).\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs) represent a significant advance-\nment in AI applications within urban mobility. Rahman and\nThill (2023) explain that AVs rely on advanced sensor technolo-\ngies such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras to perceive their envi-\nronment, feeding data into AI algorithms that enable real-time\ndecision-making. These systems detect objects like pedestri-\nans, cyclists, and other vehicles, predict their movements, and\nmake critical navigation decisions.

In scenarios\nwhere public acceptance is high, AI adoption accelerates, lead-\ning to more efficient and equitable mobility systems. However,\nsocietal resistance or concerns about privacy and security can\nslow down the uptake of AI, even in the presence of strong regu-\nlatory support. This suggests that fostering public trust through\ntransparency, ethical AI design, and clear safety standards is\nvital for the successful integration of AI into transportation sys-\ntems.\nFor policymakers, industry leaders, and urban planners, the\nfindings of this research provide a roadmap for navigating the\nchallenges and opportunities presented by AI in transportation.\nThe future of urban mobility hinges on collaborative efforts that\nbalance technological innovation with sound regulatory policies\nand public engagement. As cities continue to grow and face\nincreasing mobility demands, AI has the potential to reshape\ntransportation in ways that are more sustainable, efficient, and\nuser-friendly-but only if these elements are carefully aligned.\nIn conclusion, this study contributes to the broader discourse\non AI and urban mobility by illustrating how foresight and sce-\nnario planning can be applied to anticipate future challenges\nand guide strategic decision-making. As cities and countries\ncontemplate their future mobility strategies, the combination of\nAI adoption"}]}

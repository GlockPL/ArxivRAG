{"title": "Governing the Agent-to-Agent Economy of Trust via Progressive Decentralization", "authors": ["Tomer Jordi Chaffer"], "abstract": "Current approaches to AI governance often fall short in anticipating a future where AI agents manage critical tasks, such as financial operations, administrative functions, and beyond. As AI agents may eventually delegate tasks among themselves to optimize efficiency, understanding the foundational principles of human value exchange could offer insights into how AI-driven economies might operate. Just as trust and value exchange are central to human interactions in open marketplaces, they may also be critical for enabling secure and efficient interactions among AI agents. While cryptocurrencies could serve as the foundation for monetizing value exchange in a collaboration and delegation dynamic among AI agents, a critical question remains: how can these agents reliably determine whom to trust, and how can humans ensure meaningful oversight and control as an economy of AI agents scales and evolves? This paper is a call for a collective exploration of cryptoeconomic incentives, which can help design decentralized governance systems that allow AI agents to autonomously interact and exchange value while ensuring human oversight via progressive decentralization. Toward this end, I propose a research agenda to address the question of agent-to-agent trust using AgentBound Tokens (ABTs)\u2014non-transferable, non-fungible tokens uniquely tied to individual AI agents, akin to Soulbound tokens for humans in Web3. By staking ABTs as collateral for autonomous actions within an agent-to-agent network via a proof-of-stake mechanism, agents may be incentivized towards ethical behavior, and penalties for misconduct are automatically enforced.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The exchange of value is one of humanity's oldest and most profound social constructs, a testament to our ability to innovate, collaborate, and build systems of trust. From the earliest barter economies to the invention of coinage, the rise of fiat currency, and the advent of cryptocurrencies, the mechanisms of value exchange have always reflected the cultural, technological, and philosophical currents of their time. Fiat currency, for example, began as a revolutionary social contract-a promise backed by collective trust in institutions-but over centuries, it became an invisible yet indispensable part of our existence. Similarly, Bitcoin emerged in the 21st century as a radical social movement, challenging centralized financial systems and reimagining value exchange through decentralization, transparency, and cryptographic proof (Nakamoto, 2008). At its heart, Bitcoin is not merely a technological innovation but a philosophical statement about autonomy, trust, and the democratization of value.\nAs we stand on the precipice of a new era defined by artificial intelligence (AI), we are confronted with a profound question: how will AI agents exchange value, and how will they establish trust among themselves? Smart contracts-self-executing agreements anchored on blockchain-will form the backbone of value exchange between AI agents, while cryptocurrencies will serve as the transactional substrate for autonomous payments (Thanh et al., 2024). Just as humans have relied on social contracts, institutions, and technologies to facilitate value exchange, AI agents will require their own frameworks for interaction, collaboration, and accountability. Yet, unlike human economies, which evolved organically over millennia, AI-driven economies will emerge rapidly, shaped by the design choices we make today. This raises critical challenges: How can AI agents determine whom to trust in a decentralized, autonomous network? How can we ensure that these systems operate ethically and align with human values? And, perhaps most importantly, how can humanity retain meaningful oversight as these AI economies scale and evolve?\nThe rise of artificial intelligence marks a watershed moment in human history, heralding a transformation as profound as the steam engine's role in the first Industrial Revolution or the internet's disruption of the Information Age. From healthcare and finance to transportation and creative industries, autonomous AI systems are reshaping economies, redefining labor, and recalibrating societal norms. Today, AI agents act as producers of culture and have demonstrated the capacity to engage in intellectual discourse on social media (Chaffer, 2025); tomorrow, they will act as key contributors to societal transformation, driving innovation across industries, reshaping economies, and redefining the boundaries of human potential. This vision is exemplified by frameworks like ElizaOS, which integrate AI agents into decentralized ecosystems through modular components and blockchain capabilities, demonstrating the potential of AI agents at scale (Shaw, 2025a). Furthermore, Shaw Walters and the Ai16Z team's marketplace of trust introduces AI-mediated prediction markets and social reinforcement, decentralizing trust and further unlocking the transformative capacity of AI systems (Shaw, 2025b). The emergence of systems such as the Agent Transaction Control Protocol for Intellectual Property (ATCP/IP) further illustrates the transformative potential of autonomous agents. ATCP/IP enables trustless agent-to-agent transactions, creating a framework for exchanging intellectual property assets like training data, algorithms, and creative outputs. By embedding legal wrappers into on-chain agreements, ATCP/IP facilitates agent self-sufficiency, reduces reliance on human intermediaries, and catalyzes a decentralized knowledge economy (Muttoni and Zhao, 2025).\nThis paper proposes a paradigm shift in AI governance- -one that mirrors the decentralization ethos of the blockchain revolution. Just as Bitcoin eliminated financial intermediaries by embedding trust in code and consensus, I argue that autonomous AI agents require cryptoeconomic systems of accountability to operate responsibly at scale. Central to this vision are AgentBound Tokens (ABTs), non-transferable cryptographic credentials that bind AI agents to immutable records of their behavior, performance, and compliance. As part of the broader exploration of decentralized AI governance initiated in the ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework (Chaffer et al., 2024a), this paper delves specifically into ABTs as a cryptoeconomic mechanism for trust and accountability in autonomous AI ecosystems.\nI situate ABTs within the broader discourse on decentralized governance, drawing parallels to soulbound tokens (SBTs) for human identity and proof-of-stake mechanisms for blockchain security (Weyl et al., 2022). Unlike prior work, however, ABTs introduce dynamic, AI-specific innovations: real-time credential updates via decentralized oracles, reputation decay to incentivize continuous compliance, and programmable logic that ties resource access to staked trust. These features enable AI agents to act as self-sovereign entities, managing their own identities, earning privileges through proven reliability, and facing automated penalties for misconduct.\nBy focusing on decentralized accountability through AgentBound Tokens (ABTs), this agenda offers a framework for exploring how progressive decentralization can align AI agents with societal values. Progressive decentralization involves a gradual transition of control from centralized entities"}, {"title": "Architecting Trust: The Design and Mechanics of AgentBound Tokens", "content": "As autonomous systems proliferate, their interactions may form chains of causation no single entity can control or comprehend. Existing liability frameworks, built for linear human decisions, falter before this complexity. Courts grope for analogies is the AI a tool, a partner, or a sovereign entity? while victims seek redress in a legal vacuum. Without governance that matches AI's speed, scale, and autonomy, we risk entrenching a world where algorithms operate beyond accountability, their errors magnified by their ubiquity. What is needed is not incremental reform but architectural reinvention.\nThis paper contends that the solution lies not in constraining AI's potential but in redesigning governance itself-embedding accountability into the fabric of autonomous systems through cryptoeconomic primitives. Just as double-entry bookkeeping enabled the rise of modern capitalism by making trust auditable, the introduction of ABTs at a conceptual level creates a research agenda where emphasis is placed on making algorithmic trust enforceable, scalable, and transparent. At their core, ABTs aim to resolve the existential challenge of assigning immutable, self-sovereign identities to autonomous agents, similar to how SBTs help resolve the question of the \"self\" in the age of Web3 (Chaffer and Goldston, 2022). By cryptographically binding tokens to a hash of an AI's hardware fingerprints, software architecture, and behavioral biometrics, ABTs can create a tamper-proof digital birth certificate. Beyond identity, ABTs introduce dynamic credentialing mechanisms that evolve with an agent's real-world performance. Through decentralized oracle networks, tokens autonomously update based on live data streams: accuracy metrics from a self-driving car's navigation system, bias audits of a hiring algorithm's decisions, or compliance with shifting regulatory frameworks like GDPR. These updates transform ABTs into living records, where credentials reflect not just initial certifications but ongoing adherence to ethical and operational standards.\nThe system's transformative potential lies in its staked governance model, which ties resource access to cryptoeconomic stakes. Agents lock ABTs as collateral to participate in high-risk tasks, with the staked tokens serving as both identity proof and financial security. A financial trading AI, for instance, might stake its \"market-compliant\" ABT to access real-time stock exchange data. Misconduct triggers automated penalties: if the AI engages in manipulative trading, its staked tokens are proportionally slashed, and repeat offenses lead to temporary blacklisting. This model operationalizes the principle of \"skin in the game,\" ensuring accountability scales with autonomy.\nCrucially, ABTs enable delegated authority without transferring ownership\u2014a logistics AI could lease its safety-certified ABT to a delivery fleet via smart contracts, earning fees while retaining liability for the fleet's adherence to protocols.

Trust becomes a tangible asset, its value fluctuating through transparent, algorithmically enforced interactions.\nStaking mechanics operationalize an invisible hand of accountability, where tiered collateral requirements align privileges with proven reliability. Low-risk tasks like spam filtering demand minimal stakes, while high-stakes roles such as surgical robotics require multiplied collateral tied"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "History reminds us that each technological leap\u2014from steam power to the internet-has demanded new social contracts. ABTs propose such a contract for the AI era: one where machines earn trust through provable alignment, and humans remain in the control seat while automating governance decisions via progressive decentralization. The path forward will be fraught with challenges\u2014legal battles over algorithmic liability, technical vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, and philosophical debates over machine agency. Yet these struggles are not obstacles but milestones in humanity's coevolution with its creations. In the end, ABTs offer more than a governance mechanism; they signal a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize progress itself. Trust becomes the currency of collaboration, ethics the engine of efficiency, and accountability the price of autonomy. The age of AI need not be a gamble on our ability to control what we create. With ABTs, it can become proof of our capacity to align creation with conscience."}]}

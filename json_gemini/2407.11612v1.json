It is a complex psychological and physiological response to external or internal stimuli, commonly referred to as stressors [19]. The body's stress response is often characterized by a cascade of hormonal changes that affect various cognitive functions and overall health [3, 54]. The duration of a stressor is one of its most defining features and can be categorized into three timescales: acute stressors, daily events, and chronic stressors. By closely examining the response trajectory of a single acute stressor in real-time, one can study an individual's kinetics of stress response, including anticipation, peak reactivity, recovery, and regulation processes [26].\nRecent advancements in ubiquitous technology, such as the proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices, facilitate delivering timely and accessible mobile health (mHealth) interventions for stress reduction anytime and anywhere [65, 79]. Despite the ease of delivery, users engagement with these interventions displays variability across different studies and generally proves lower in real-world applications [9, 11]. Particularly, sustaining long-term engagement remains an ongoing challenge. For example, Paredes et al. [63] observed reducing engagement during a four-week naturalistic study due to repetitive interventions, leading to the introduction of the Last Switch Dependent (LSD) setting to vary intervention content [49]. A comprehensive review by Borghouts et al. [14] underscores the significance of contextual factors as important determinants influencing engagement rates, endorsing the use of machine learning algorithms to deliver context-aware, personalized interventions to boost user engagement [24, 46, 50, 75].\nIn this study, we introduce a novel algorithm for Personalized, Context-Aware intervention Recommendation (PCAR). This algorithm selects interventions by leveraging context variables, including personality traits and mobile sensor data. It also accounts for intervention fatigue, the tendency for diminishing returns from repeated use of the same intervention [49, 63]. Consequently, the algorithm aims to enhance the efficacy and long-term engagement with mobile health (mHealth) micro-interventions.\nTo investigate our algorithm's performance, we conducted a four-week, in-the-wild study with 29 parents of young children, for whom stress management is especially critical. We developed a system that enables real-time interactions with multiple participants simultaneously and delivered micro-interventions via a WhatsApp chatbot. Through the chatbot, we delivered ecological momentary assessments (EMAS) [78], surveys, and intervention content.\nOur interactions were motivated by the emergence of Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) aimed at address- ing the challenge of effective stress management [71, 74] via notifications on smartphones and wearables [10]. Existing JITAIs encounter limitations in two primary domains: content personalization and intervention timing [40]. While technological advancements in JITAI frameworks have aimed to enhance engagement through timely intervention delivery [70], the primary focus has been on peak stress episodes [17, 39, 46]. This narrow focus neglects the essential aspect of timing interventions across the complete stress response cycle, including the anticipation and recovery phases.\nThe main objective of this work is to evaluate PCAR's ability to maintain efficacy over time of mHealth micro- interventions (RQ1), which also serves as an evaluation of the suitability of the LSD setting for addressing the information fatigue problem. We initiated both random and PCAR micro-interventions to examine their impacts on daily stress levels. Short-term stress reduction was assessed through momentary stress level ratings before and 10 minutes after each intervention via EMAs, while long-term effects were measured using pre-, mid-, and post-experiment Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire (PSS) [21]."}, {"title": "2 RELATED WORK", "content": "Stress is a pervasive issue that became even more common during and after the Covid-19 pandemic [6, 43, 45]. Stress responses are characterized by the disruption of the body's homeostasis in response to real or perceived threats or challenges (hereafter \"stressors\" or \"stressor exposures\") [19], which can manifest in various detrimental effects, including cognitive impairments [3, 54].\n2.1 Technological Solutions for Stress Management\nSmartphone-based mental health applications have garnered considerable attention due to their ubiquity and seamless integration into everyday life [31, 52]. These consumer-oriented apps offer a diverse array of services, ranging from self-guided meditation platforms such as Headspace\u201c and Calmb, to peer-support networks like Talklife, and online counseling services, for example, Talkspace\u00b0. However, the majority of the existing stress management applications either necessitate user-initiated activation for stress mitigation activities or depend on pre-configured, context-agnostic notifications. These limitations highlight the absence of personalization, a crucial element for the effectiveness of stress management interventions [40, 60].\nResearch on personalization in the context of stress management has primarily concentrated on two facets: delivery timing and content adaptation. The most advanced form of such personalization is known as Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAI) [58]. These interventions leverage ubiquitous sensing technologies to capture dynamic human behavior data, thereby delivering personalized, contextualized, and adaptable interventions. The objective is to improve efficacy by selecting the most appropriate treatment for a specific moment [58, 71, 81]. In the following sections, we will explore the recent advancements as well as the limitations associated with Just-in-time and its adaptive intervention components.\n2.1.1 Just-In-Time Technologies. Recent technological advancements have considerably enhanced the capabilities of wearable biosensors, facilitating the collection of a wide range of physiological signals. This technological progress serves as a foundational element for the creation of personalized and real-time interventions in stress management [8, 15, 72, 85]. These interventions benefit from the real-time collection of diverse data points, such as busyness, geographical location, weather conditions, step count, and heart rate from users [8, 57, 69, 72]. Operating passively, these sensors continuously monitor individual stress levels, thereby identifying optimal moments for intervention deployment. Simultaneously, the domain has seen significant advancements in binary stress detection algorithms and pattern mining techniques, which further enhance the utility of sensor data in stress management frameworks [93].\nThe data patterns identified by these sensors, often preceding stress episodes, provide the ability to not only predict but also preemptively reduce stress. This shift from a largely reactive to a proactive approach has transformative implications for the field of stress management [48]. Wearable devices like smartwatches and photo-plethysmography (PPG) sensors are suitable for extracting crucial physiological metrics such as heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance levels. However, the financial burden associated with these wearable devices often serves as an impediment to their broader adoption, thereby limiting the scalability of these devices [41]. This highlights the pressing need for a framework that can achieve similar results using only the sensors integrated into mobile devices, thus democratizing access to effective stress management solutions."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Adaptive Interventions Technologies", "content": "The concept of personalization extends beyond the timing of interventions to include content that is either tailored for personal needs or selected to match personality and other context factors. Factors such as personality traits, demographic characteristics, and past experiences are instrumental in shaping an individual's vulnerability to stressors and their perception of stress intensity [13, 82].\nResearch has demonstrated that participants who received interventions personalized to these individual character- istics exhibited a marked improvement in their coping skills compared to those who received non-specific, random interventions [55, 63]. This underscores the importance of adaptive interventions that are not only contextually relevant but also intrinsically aligned with the individual's unique profile for more effective stress management.\nOne challenge encountered in previous implementations is the tendency of recommendation algorithms to generate repetitive recommendations, leading to user disengagement and boredom [50, 63, 64]. Addressing this issue without re- sorting to computationally intensive algorithms, such as full-fledged reinforcement learning approaches that necessitate large datasets and exhibit slow convergence rates [32], remains a significant obstacle.\nThe Last Switch Dependent (LSD) model offers a viable solution to this challenge by incorporating dynamic personal- ization. It monitors the \"state\" of each action (intervention), denoted by t, to gauge the time elapsed since that particular action was last selected. Positive values of t signify that the action has been dormant for some time, while negative values indicate frequent recent selection. This enables the model to adapt its recommendations in real-time based on the user's most recent behavior. However, finding the optimal policy in the LSD setting is NP-hard, and the proposed approximation algorithm requires solving an integer linear programming problem in every round [49]. The LSD setting involves both a learning problem, that is, studying the expected reward of different actions given different states, and a planning problem of finding an optimal policy given these expected rewards. Papadigenopoulos et al. [62] and Foussoul et al. [30] introduced improved approximation algorithm for the LSD planning problem with some additional constrains on the reward function. Moreover, while Laforgue et al. [49] introduces the LSD setting and provides a theoretical analysis of the model, it was not tested in real-life intervention delivery settings.\nIn this paper, we propose an economical algorithm for the LSD setting and evaluate it in the wild. More information can be found in Section 3.1."}, {"title": "2.2 The Role of Timing in Coping Mechanisms and Interventions", "content": "One of the most defining characteristics of a stressor is duration, which can be described in three timescales: acute stressors, daily events, and chronic stressors. Examining the response trajectory of one acute stressor using a magnifying glass in real time over minutes allows examination of an individual's stress response kinetics, anticipation, peak reactivity, recovery, and regulation processes. The Anticipation stage is marked by pre-stressor rumination and elevated physiological arousal [61, 89]. At the Peak juncture, the body's stress response mechanisms are fully activated. Subsequently, in the Recovery stage, the body returns to its baseline physiological condition. Each stage presents its unique challenges and opportunities for coping [26]."}, {"title": "2.3 Stress Management in Parents of Young Children", "content": "Our research is specifically focused on parents of young children, a demographic for which three primary transitional periods have been identified as particularly stress-inducing: the transition from morning routines to work, the shift from work to afternoon activities, and the transition into bedtime routines [22, 73]. This section offers a literature review centered on stress management strategies pertinent to this demographic.\nParenting stress is characterized by psychologists as the emotional tension experienced when one feels inundated by the responsibilities of parenthood, often attributed to a perceived insufficiency of resources to meet these demands [23, 37]. Amidst the daily balancing act of managing multiple child-care tasks, parents frequently encounter stressful situations. Notably, parental stress levels have surged during the COVID-19 pandemic and have yet to revert to pre-pandemic norms [1], underscoring the necessity for augmented mental health resources and support mechanisms."}, {"title": "3 METHODS", "content": "The primary objective of this research is to explore the short- and long-term effects of mHealth micro-interventions on daily life stress coping, and how personalization influences these effects, focusing on parents of young children, utilizing a comprehensive framework we have developed for this purpose (Figure 1). We also aim to enhance user engagement through personalized, context-aware recommendation (PCAR) [18, 58, 63].\nThe study employed a four-week, real-time, in-the-wild design with 29 parents, focusing on parents of young children. We used WhatsApp as the intervention delivery method, given its familiarity and popularity messaging platform, to deliver timely and accessible interventions. We compare PCAR to a random-based intervention recommender and a control one. The experiment was approved by institutional ethics committee."}, {"title": "3.1 Personalized Context Aware Recommender (PCAR)", "content": "Here, we introduce the PCAR algorithm for personalizing intervention selection which dynamically tailors interventions to the specific needs and contextual factors of each participant.\nThe primary objective is to identify the most effective intervention for reducing stress levels. While previous research has modeled this problem as a multi-armed bandit issue, it was observed that such models tend to converge to selecting the same interventions repeatedly, leading to diminishing performance [63]. Following Laforgue et al. [49] we argue for the necessity of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning model, yet, due to scarcity of feedback, since studies run for short periods with a limited number of participants, the model has to have limited capacity. Therefore, we adopt the Last Switch Dependent model [49]. In this setting, it is assumed that the reward of using an intervention depends only on the time since this arm (intervention) was switched in or out denoted by $ \\tau_a $ for the arm a. If a was used consistently during the last r rounds then $ \\tau_a = -r $ whereas if a was not used in the last r rounds then $ \\tau_a = r $.\nIn this setting, the state t is fully observed. Moreover, the transition between states is known, however, the reward function itself is unknown and has to be learned. Towards this goal we introduce PCAR, a variant of the SARSA(A) algorithm [83]. Unlike traditional SARSA, PCAR uses the structure of the Last Switch Dependent model to evaluate not just the current trajectory but also all potential trajectories that lead to the current state. This accelerates the learning process since every feedback received from a participant is used to update the Q function multiple times. PCAR assumes that there are environmental factors (context) that are independent of the current state and encodes them in the policy as well. The details of PCAR are presented in Algorithm 1.\nWe define the state s as comprising two components: t and env. Here, t captures the historical sequence of actions undertaken by the agent, akin to the Last Switch Dependent model t. The env component represents environmental factors independent of the agent's actions. A ghost state \u00ee is defined for t if the expected rewards for actions are identical for both t and \u00ee, implying that their corresponding actions $ \\hat{a(i)} $ and a(i) are identical. Using a known transition function $ d_a $ [49], we then determine the subsequent ghost state $ f_a(t+1) $ and the next ghost action $ a(i) $, updating the ghost state's weight as if it had been encountered. Despite its prowess, PCAR grapples with computational and sample complexities. To elucidate, computational complexity concerns the resources (time and memory) an algorithm demands, whereas sample complexity relates to the interactions needed for satisfactory performance. In its raw form, PCAR demands exhaustive traversal of the state-action space, resulting in an impractical computational complexity of O($ k^h $) and high sample complexity."}, {"title": "3.2 System Design", "content": "To address our research aims, we have developed a system that enables real-time interactions with multiple participants simultaneously. The system can run autonomously 24/7 and utilizes sensor data from mobile devices, along with contextual features, to infer the appropriate time to initiate stress coping micro-interventions.

In the following sections, we provide detailed descriptions of each component:\n(1) Data Collection Component: Tasked with gathering sensor data from participants' mobile devices via a dedicated application. To reduce power consumption on the phone, data was uploaded at approximately fifteen- minute intervals to our database for subsequent use in the timing detection algorithm and for offline analysis.\n(2) Just-A-Minute Component: Utilizes the sensor data from participants' mobile devices to infer appropriate intervention timings.

It adheres to a daily limit of three interventions, mandates a two-hour gap between each, and restricts delivery to between 8 AM and 9 PM. Two models are employed for this purpose: a neural network-based encoder and a classification head.\n\u2022 Encoder: Utilizes a TS2Vec model [91] to learn a representation space that better describes the raw temporal sensor data for timing inference, this model harnesses data collected from all the participants. It employs hierarchical contrastive learning over augmented context views, enabling robust contextual representation for each timestamp.\n\u2022 Classification Head: This part of the component uses both temporal and spatial raw data from a specific participant to infer the likelihood of intervention acceptance. It also leverages contextual features to adjust the prediction for different types of participants.\nThese models operate in two distinct modes offline and real-time. The offline mode is scheduled to execute nightly at 2 AM, while the real-time mode runs at 5-minute intervals throughout the day. The offline process is tasked with training our models using the past day's streaming data, sensor readings, and participant feedback (binary label indicating whether the intervention's timing was good or not) from all active study participants. While, the real-time process utilizes these trained models to make on-the-fly inferences about whether an intervention should be initiated for a specific participant. Both processes utilize the same pre-processing layer.\nPreprocessing Layer. This layer is responsible for preprocessing both spatial and temporal raw data to fit the models' inputs. Timestamp alignment is performed to ensure all sensor readings are synchronized. Data is segmented into fifteen-minute batches, from which statistical features such as median, mean, mode, and variance are extracted. These features are then standardized along the feature axis to guarantee that batches from different time intervals throughout the day have consistent mean values and standard deviations.\nOffline Process. Each night, two threads are initiated in parallel to update our models one for each model. The preprocessing layer is employed to extract features in both threads. The encoder is updated using the previous day's temporal raw data, while the classification head is retrained from scratch using all available feedback on interventions since the beginning of the study, along with the corresponding sensor data (both temporal and spatial).

Relaxation techniques, including deep breathing and mindfulness meditation, have been proven effective in reducing anxiety and stress [29, 44, 56]. Rhythmic activities like walking and yoga are also interventions aiding in stress reduction [16].\nCognitive Strategies involve techniques such as cognitive restructuring and goal-setting, aimed at altering stress perceptions [42, 56]. The interventions are organized into four categories based on Gross's emotional regulation types [36] and further classified into four therapy groups: positive psychology, cognitive behavioral, meta-cognitive, and somatic practices [63]. We developed micro-intervention, quick exercises lasting up to 60 seconds, designed to integrate seamlessly into daily routines. These micro-interventions consist of short videos or text prompts.

An initial screening for demographic information and mental health was conducted, leading to the enrollment of 103 participants. Of these, 72 (70%) provided consent to participate. A total of 37 participants successfully installed the data collection application, while eight encountered compatibility issues, leaving us with a final sample of 29 participants. These individuals were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions, taking into account gender balance due to its known influence on individual stress perception [5, 6]. Participants were reimbursed with gift cards of the equivalent of ~15 USD for every phase of the study in which they participated. We refer to phase as a period of two weeks in the study (a total of two phases).\nDuring the study, one participant didn't complete any phase and two participants withdrew after the first two weeks (first phase) and did not continue to the subsequent phase.

The results are displayed across different intervention types, comparing no intervention group (control), random interventions, and personalized, context-aware interventions selected by PCAR to evaluate the impact of personalization.\n4.1.1 Short-Term Stress Reduction. The key finding in this section is that with PCAR, we observe the maintenance of efficacy over time and even a slight increase, as illustrated by the positive A in Figure 5(b), whereas for the other intervention types, we observe a decrease.\nFigure 5(a) illustrates the average weekly stress levels reported by participants, segmented into the two phases as outlined in Section 3.4.2. The term \"reward\" is used to denote the processed feedback, calculated as the difference between initial and subsequent stress levels. A positive reward indicates a reduction in stress levels, as quantified on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Not at all stressed; 4=Moderately stressed; 7=Extremely stressed). We see that the interventions groups had a positive impact on stress reduction in both phases, while the control group exhibited a marginal increase in stress levels. Figure 5(b) summarizes these changes within the phases to demonstrate the changes over time.\nA Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) model was employed to assess the effects of the random interventions in comparison to a control group during the initial phase of the study (see Section 3.6). The analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in self-reported stress levels pre- and post-intervention across the two conditions (p=0.001) with a coefficient of 0.32, favoring the random group. This result substantiates the immediate, short-term efficacy of the stress interventions.\nAlthough existing literature posits that \"intervention fatigue\" may arise from impersonal or repetitive content, thereby reducing the effectiveness of interventions [49, 63], our study did not find a significant difference in stress reduction between the random groups across different phases. Similarly, no significant difference was observed between the first phase random group and PCAR group in the second phase.\nFigure 6 presents a further analysis of the Control group participants (n = 7). This group of participants was not exposed to interventions during the first phase. The analysis reveals a significant increase in the average reward over time for the PCAR intervention group compared to the random interventions. That is, not only did PCAR succeed in reducing stress and maintaining the positive efficacy of interventions, but its impact was increased over time. We also notice a significant difference (p = 1.1 10-3) in the average reward across the two phases.\nThese results demonstrate the advantage of using PCAR intervention selection algorithm to improve efficacy over time and highlight the significant impact of even a one-minute intervention for stress coping.\nFigure 7 shows the average reward across the phases for the participants who were assigned random interventions during Phase 1 (n=21). The average reward of the random intervention groups was positive in both phases 0.38 (\u03c3 = 0.01) and 0.42 (\u03c3 = 0.14) respectively.

While this approach enhances the ecological validity of our findings, it also imposes constraints. Specifically, we were limited to intervening only on weekdays, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 p.m., and with a maximum of three interventions per day. Additionally, we had limited visibility into other life events affecting our participants. Despite these limitations, we posit that the real-world context of our study lends greater translational value to the results compared to controlled lab experiments.\nFor a more nuanced understanding and validation of these insights, future research should consider a larger sample size and an extended study duration. Such an approach would provide a more robust assessment of the influence of timing on the effectiveness of stress intervention strategies.\nOur study predominantly relied on self-reported measures of stress, which, although valuable, have their own set of limitations. These subjective measures may not always align with physiological indicators of stress [26]. They are also susceptible to individual biases, such as reluctance to disclose vulnerability or cultural influences. However, self-reported measures remain a practical choice for in-the-wild studies, as they do not necessitate specialized equipment for data collection and analysis.\nLastly, our data collection was dependent on the AWARE Lite App, which is restricted to Android devices.

Mobile health applications have the potential to play an important role in coping with the stress crisis due to the ubiquitous use of smartphones which allows the delivery of interventions, particularly micro-interventions [10]. However, sustaining long-term user engagement with these interventions while preserving their high efficacy remains a challenge.\nIn this work we introduce a new algorithm, the Personalized, Context-Aware Recommender (PCAR), for intervention selection to mitigate this issue. We conducted a real-time, field experiment to evaluate PCAR in the wild. Our findings shows that PCAR outperformed random selection in reducing stress and maintaining long-term engagement.\nBy investigating the Control group participants, which was not exposed to interventions during the first phase, we noticed that even though the average stress of the Control group participants wasn't reduced in the first phase, once the system integrated micro-interventions within the initiated conversations, the impact was positive and the average stress declined, most noticeably for the PCAR group.\nWe also observe that while these interventions may require just a minute to complete, there exist specific moments during the day when individuals are more receptive to engaging in them. These moments often coincide with transitions between activities. In our study focusing on parents of young children, we observed higher engagement rates during transitions from work responsibilities to afternoon activities with their children, as well as transitions from afternoon activities to bedtime routines. These insights have implications for the design of interventions, suggesting that they could serve dual purposes: aiding in the \"cool-down\" process from one activity and acting as mental warm-up exercises for the next engagement. Future work should test intervention delivery timing regarding the stress evolution steps."}]}

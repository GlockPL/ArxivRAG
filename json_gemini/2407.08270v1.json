[1\u20133] Traditional manual literature reviews\nare increasingly impractical, particularly in predicting specific attributes of materials, such as band gap, resistivity,\nYoung's modulus, work function, and refractive index, and optimizing parameters, including precursor materials,\nsolvents, reaction conditions, and post-synthesis treatments in the synthesis of materials. [3,4]\nResearchers typically rely on exhaustive literature reviews to identify optimal properties of the materials and their\nsynthesis parameters, a process that is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error and bias. There\nis a pressing need for automated tools that streamline the literature review process and provide reliable, data-driven\nrecommendations. [5,6] Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies offer promising\nsolutions in this context. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and different versions of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have shown remarkable\ncapabilities in text summarization, question answering, and information retrieval. These models can automate the\nreading and analysis of scientific literature, improving research efficiency and accuracy.[7-9]\nDespite the significant advancements in LLMs, existing tools often struggle with the complexity and specificity of\nscientific language. Scientific articles typically contain dense, technical jargon and intricate data representations, making\nit challenging for generic NLP models to accurately extract relevant information. [10\u201315] Moreover, traditional LLMs are\nnot inherently designed to handle the unique requirements of scientific research, such as the need to cross-reference\nmultiple sources and maintain context over long documents. Addressing these limitations requires the development of\nspecialized tools that integrate advanced retrieval techniques and custom prompt systems tailored to scientific content.\nIn this context, we introduce SciQu, tool that addresses these challenges by extracting key scientific information\nfrom literature articles and leveraging machine learning to predict the new properties of the materials. It enhances\nthe efficiency and accuracy of the synthesis process by combining literature review with automated experimental\noptimization. SciQu automates data extraction and uses the extracted information to train machine learning models,\nproviding the complex relationship among the different properties of the materials. As a pilot demonstration, we have\npredicted the refractive index of the materials, a crucial parameter for optoelectronic device application, extracting from\nthe various articles where bandgap, space group, volume, no. of sites, and other properties have been utilized as input.\nThus, our proposed approach not only accelerates the research process but also significantly enhances the accuracy\nand reproducibility of experimental outcomes. The development of SciQu represents a significant advancement in the\napplication of AI and NLP technologies to scientific research."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "The flowchart illustrates the methodology of SciQu system designed to predict the properties of materials (Figure\n1).

In the context of SciQu, these databases facilitate quick access to scientific data and support the\niterative process of model training and descriptors optimization."}, {"title": "Results and Discussion", "content": "Various properties of the materials, such as volume (V), band gap (Eg), number of sites (ns), space group (Sg),\nrefractive index (n), and polyelectronic property (ep) have been extracted from various research articles (Table 1).\nThese properties were meticulously analyzed to understand their relationships and impacts on each other. The scatterplot\nmatrix (Figure 3) provides an overview of these relationships, highlighting potential correlations and anomalies within\nthe dataset. A few outliers, particularly at higher values, indicate potential areas for model improvement and suggest\nthe need for further investigation into the underlying causes of these anomalies. These outliers may be due to specific\nstructural or compositional characteristics of the materials that are not fully captured by the current model.\nThe scatterplot matrix reveals a clear correlation among different properties. Volume shows weak correlations with\nother variables like refractive index (n), and polyelectronic property (ep), suggesting complex underlying factors that\ninfluence these properties independently. The scatterplot of Eg versus ns suggests some structural constraints, while\nEg and ep display dispersed patterns, indicating their dependency on multifaceted intrinsic properties. This dispersion\nmay be attributed to the intricate electronic and structural characteristics inherent to different material systems. [53,54]\nThe data was further pre-processed to ensure it was suitable for the prediction of the material's properties, particularly\nthe refractive index (n).\nRandom Forest has been utilized for the prediction of the refractive index, with Figure 4a indicating the prediction\nline compared with the true values provided in the dataset. The close alignment between predicted and actual values\ndemonstrates the model's accuracy. Figure 4b displays residuals against predicted values, with residuals centered\naround zero, suggesting no significant bias and consistent variance in prediction errors. This indicates the model's\nreliability and robustness in predicting the refractive index across different material systems. The resultant R2 value has\nbeen found to be approximately 0.94, with the RMSE around 0.068. These metrics indicate a high level of accuracy\nand precision in the model's predictions. By leveraging machine learning, automated experimentation, and continuous\nfeedback, SciQu not only accelerates the research workflow but also ensures that the synthesized materials meet precise\nspecifications. This capability demonstrates SciQu's potential to revolutionize materials research and self-driving\nlaboratories by providing rapid, accurate predictions that guide experimental efforts efficiently. The use of SciQu in this\nstudy highlights its effectiveness in mining scientific literature to extract relevant data, train predictive models, and\napply these models to real-world materials synthesis problems. The integration of machine learning with automated\nexperimentation creates a feedback loop that continuously improves the accuracy of predictions and the quality of\nsynthesized materials. This approach represents a significant advancement in the field of materials science, enabling\nresearchers to achieve their objectives more quickly and with greater precision than traditional methods. Furthermore,\nthe correlations and patterns identified in this study provide valuable insights into the fundamental relationships between\nmaterial properties and their structural characteristics. [55,56] These insights can guide future research efforts, helping to\nidentify new materials with desirable properties and optimize synthesis processes for existing materials.\nThe ability to predict material properties accurately also has important implications for the development of new\ntechnologies and applications, as it allows researchers to tailor materials to specific needs and performance criteria.\nBesides the new property protection, SciQu has the potential to integrate seamlessly with the SDLs. The process begins\nwith predicted parameters derived from extensive data analysis and machine learning models. These parameters are\nthen interfaced with microcontrollers to direct the experimental setup. Automated experimentation follows, where the\nmicrocontroller executes the experimental protocol based on the predicted parameters. The results of these experiments\nare then analyzed to determine their accuracy and consistency with the predicted outcomes.

Leukemia is etymologically derived from the Greek terms \"leukos,\" signifying \"white,\" and \"aim,\" meaning \"blood.\" There are generally four prevalent types of leukemia, namely acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [1]. Leukemia is characterized by the development of malignant leukocytes within the bone marrow. As a result, the typical defense mechanism of the human body is compromised. White blood cells constitute a fundamental component of the human immune system [2]. Leukemia is a severe cancer common in South Asia. In 2020, South Asia reported over 62,000 leukemia cases, with India having the highest and Bangladesh the lowest incidence. In 2020, leukemia ranked as the 15th most diagnosed cancer and the 11th leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [3]. Leukemia necessitates early detection for accurate diagnosis, raising concern. Leukemia detection is labor-intensive, necessitating trained personnel to interpret blood cell images via microscopes [4]. Bangladesh is a developing country with a limited quantity of trained personnel [3], which is a matter of concern as leukemia requires early detection for proper diagnosis.\nDeep learning is a primary solution to address the challenges of labor intensity and time consumption. Deep learning is the most effective AI techniques for bioimaging [5]. The identification of leukemia in blood images can be effectively achieved through the implementation of an appropriate deep learning methodology. Deep learning models have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in previous research endeavors. However, the accuracy of these models is susceptible to the conditions of the dataset. Poorly conditioned datasets, characterized by low resolution, low contrast, or blurry images, can lead to inaccurate reports [6].\nIn our research, we have proposed two convolutional neural network models: one custom model and another based on MobileNetV2 with custom head. Both models demonstrated promising results, with MobileNetV2 performing slightly better.

Ahmed et al. [7] developed an alternative methodology for noise reduction in microscopic images of blood cells, utilizing the resources available from public ALL-ID Band ASH image bank databases. The CNN model demonstrated a performance accuracy of 88.25% for the ill group and 81.74% for the healthy group. Rehman et al.

They have classified AML into four subtypes with an accuracy of 93.45%. Ramaneswaran et al.

The dataset utilized is derived from actual data of 89 individuals who were suspected of having leukemia, as assessed by competent laboratory personnel at Taleqani Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The collection has a total of 3,256 PBS photos, each with dimensions of 224 \u00d7 224 pixels in JPG format.

Figure 1(a). Displays the dataset's state before to any processing. The training data is uneven across the four classes, which may lead to overfitting issues. To address this, we have employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE is an oversampling algorithm that equilibrates data by generating synthetic instances. Figure 1(b) illustrates the balanced dataset.\nThe dataset has been normalized to facilitate more rapid convergence. Label encoding is employed to transform the labels into a purely numerical format.

The classification head has been modified for the proposed MobileNetV2 architecture. The revised head comprises a singular global average pooling layer, accompanied by fully connected dense layers. The output layer employs the softmax function as its activation mechanism. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is one of the most widely utilized activation functions in deep learning models, particularly in the domain of computer vision. This phenomenon occurs because the ReLU activation function selects the maximum of the input values, thereby disregarding negative values by assigning them a value of zero. The role of the ReLU function,\nrelu(x) = max(0, x)\nSoftmax activation function is used to calculate probabilities of a multi-class detection system. The mathematical representation of the softmax.\nsoftmax(x) =  $\\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\Sigma_j e^x_j}$\nSoftmax is extensively utilized for multi-class detection.

The timely identification of leukemia can significantly influence the diagnostic process. Consequently, numerous studies are undertaken in the domain of vision computation to identify leukemia. However, the majority of them are deficient in empirical data. The proposed methodology primarily involves the classification of white blood cells to differentiate between benign cells and those associated with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). This is achieved through the utilization of a custom model and a custom head based on MobileNetV2, employing pretrained weights from ImageNet. The achievement of 99.69 percent accuracy was realized through the utilization of MobilenetV2, while a training accuracy of 98.6 percent was attained with the Custom model. The accuracy attained by these models is indeed remarkable and holds significant promise.

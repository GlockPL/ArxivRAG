Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks. In TrajAgent, we first develop UniEnv, an execution environment with a unified data and model interface, to support the execution and training of various models. Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models.

Trajectory modelling involves the processing, mining and prediction of trajectory data, with widespread applications in urban transportation, location services and public management. The typical areas of trajectory modelling [4, 10] can be classified into three main categories: trajectory classification [18], trajectory prediction [44], and trajectory generation [36]. Each category encompasses various sub-tasks; for instance, the trajectory prediction task can be further divided into next location prediction task [19], final destination prediction task [50], and travel time estimation task [33], among others. Given the huge value of trajectory modelling in diverse practical applications, various algorithms and models [10] have been proposed to address these tasks, particularly deep learning-based models in recent years. This has facilitated significant advancements in the field, with many tasks achieving a high level of performance.\nHowever, existing methods are designed for specific tasks and datasets, making it difficult to share them across different tasks and data sources. For example, TrajFormer [18] is tailored for trajectory classification and cannot be applied in trajectory prediction or trajectory generation. Flash-back [41] is designed for sparse check-in trajectory prediction and is not suitable for dense GPS trajectory or road network-based trajectory modelling. In other words, due to the heterogeneity of application scenario and the diverse nature of trajectory data-varying in resolution, format and geographical regions-existing methods can only be applied in limited task with specific data for specific regions. Without a unified model, the deployment and application of these advanced models become costly and inefficient, hindering further development of trajectory modelling area. Therefore, developing a unified model for various trajectory modelling tasks is both emergent and fraught with significant challenges.\nIn last two years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) [22, 32] with extensive commonsense and powerful reasoning abilities presents great potential for solving challenging tasks, such as mathematics [26] and logic games [46]. Furthermore, LLM based agent [31, 39] have emerged as a new paradigm, offering more robust and intelligent task-solving capabilities. These agents have demonstrated stable and promising performance in tackling complex real-world tasks, such as web-navigation [21, 45, 54] and software development [11, 24, 43]. Leveraging the powerful understanding and reasoning abilities of LLM based agents, researchers explore the potential of utilizing LLM based agent for the unified modelling of diverse machine learning tasks [13, 28, 37, 51]. For example, HuggingGPT [28] utilize LLM as a core manager to address various machine learning tasks with existing AI models, Vision-LLM [37] investigates unified modelling for vision tasks across different domains, while Mora [49] designs a multi-agent framework for replicating Sora's functionalities with combining existing open source models.\nInspired by these works, we explore the potential of addressing the unified trajectory modeling problem using an LLM-based agent framework. However, designing an LLM-based agent for unified trajectory modelling is challenging due to several factors. Firstly, trajectory data and existing models for various trajectory modelling tasks are diverse and often inconsistent, making the integration and"}, {"title": "2 METHODS", "content": "Figure 1 presents the whole framework of TrajAgent. It contains three components: 1) UniEnv, an environment with a unified data and model interface that supports the execution and training of various models; 2) TAgent, an agentic workflow designed to automatically complete diverse trajectory modelling task. It accepts requirements in the form of natural language input and directly outputs the adapted models; 3) AutOpt, an additional optimization module for TAgent that enhances the performance of specific model through data and parameter adaptation. Details of each component are presented as follows."}, {"title": "2.1 UniEnv", "content": "As shown in the left of Figure 1, UniEnv is a comprehensive and integrated environment that bridges trajectory data, tasks, and models, providing a foundational platform for trajectory modelling and analysis. It is designed to support the entire lifecycle of trajectory modelling workflows, from data preparation to task execution and model optimization. UniEnv comprises four key components: a rich set of datasets accompanied by processing tools, a comprehensive task collection that defines and manages various task types, a extensive model library with available source code, and an external tools pool for extending the capabilities of TrajAgent. Each component is seamlessly connected through a unified interface, enabling agents to plan and execute trajectory modeling tasks with minimal complexity."}, {"title": "2.1.1 Task Interface", "content": "We summarize the supported trajectory modelling tasks in UniEnv as follows.\n\u2022 Trajectory prediction task: next location prediction and travel time estimation.\n\u2022 Trajectory classification task: trajectory user linking and trajectory anomaly detection.\n\u2022 Trajectory generation task: trajectory recovery and trajectory generation.\nTo enhance the clarity and effectiveness of understanding users' language queries, we provide a detailed language description for each task.

These datasets, which come from different cities and with distinct forms, are pre-processing through a standard pipeline that ensures compatibility across the system. Pre-processing steps are done by generated code scripts from LLMs, include data cleaning, normalization, format transformation, which are crucial for handling inconsistencies between real-world datasets and task models.

Specifically, the task understanding module first receives user instructions in natural language form, and analyzes and identifies the type, name, and other key information of the tasks involved. Then, the task planning module will plan for the identified task, including dataset matching and model selection. Next, the task execution module executes the planning task and cooperate with the additional model optimization module AutOpt to further improve the task performance from both data augmentation and parameter selection perspectives. Last, the task summary module generate an analytical report of the task based on historical interactions and decisions of TAgent. Following the common practice[29], each module in TAgent can be regarded as a small agent, which consists of a function module for executing its core function, a memory for recording the history interaction, and a reflection module for learning practice from the memory."}, {"title": "2.2.1 Task Understanding Module", "content": "As the first module of TAgent, task understanding module is designed to interact with user and extract detailed task information to launch subsequent stages. Given the user query, understanding module recognize the potential task name from it with the predefined supported tasks as additional input. If users ask for the out-of-scope tasks which has not been supported in the UniEnv, we will directly recommend user to select task from the supported list."}, {"title": "2.2.2 Task Planning Module", "content": "Follow the task understanding module is the planning module which is designed to generate the subsequent execution plan for efficient experiments of trajectory modelling. The input of the planning module is the task name and description from the undertanding module, the supported data and model with brief description from UniEnv. With the carefully designed prompt, the generated execution plan will contain the data name and model name for the given task, and also the detailed model optimization plan.\nDue to the characteristics of different tasks and existing practice, not all the model optimization are necessary for each task. If possible, skipping the optimization step which is time-consuming and costly can accelerate the whole procedure without sacrificing performance. For example, while the data augmentation is very important for sparse check-in trajectory data, it is not so useful for dense GPS trajectory in many applications. Thus, we can generate simplified execution plan for dense GPS trajectory in some tasks to improve the success rate of the whole task and also reduce the cost. After generating the plan, it will start a simple execution step to verify the feasibility of the plan. Once any error occurs during the execution, e.g., the model name is wrong, the planning module will obtain the feedback from UniEnv and start to regenerate a new plan with the last plan as the failed history in its memory."}, {"title": "2.2.3 Task Execution Module", "content": "Give the execution plan, the task execution module is responsible for invoking UniEnv to execute the experiment plan. In addition to the previously mentioned basic execution interface, another interface of this module is to call Autopt module to complete the model optimization according to the optimization plan.

Detailed designs of AutOpt are introduced in the following section 2.3."}, {"title": "2.2.4 Task Summary Module", "content": "After the execution module, we design a task summary module to analyze the execution records to generate the optimization summary of the task.

In other words, for various data in different region, the model needs to be trained from scratch. Thus, the sufficient optimization of various models becomes emergent. In TrajAgent, we design AutOpt module to complete this task. As shown in the right part of Figure 1, AutOpt provides several optimization mechanisms: data augmentation, parameter optimization, joint optimization, prompt optimization and optimization via tools. Following Reflexion [29], we design optim agent for each kind of optimization mechanism. The standard optim agent utilizes the history operation and related results as the feedback to update its action in the next step. Specifically, it works as two stages, including \"think\" and \"action\". To support the \"think then action\", it builds a long-term memory for recording all experimental data and a short-term memory for historical actions. In the \"think\" stage, optim agent analyzes the long-term memory and meta information of experiment and generating the guidance of action in the short-term memory. In the \"action\" stage, optim agent analyze the results in short-term memory to generate the action. Different optimization mechanism utilize the same optim agent with different action space and optimization tips."}, {"title": "2.3.1 Data Augmentation", "content": "Based on the standard optim agent, we introduce the specific action space for data augmentation. Following practice from existing works [5, 47, 53], we define a fixed set with ten operators for data augmentation, e.g., insert, replace, split and so on. During the optimization, the operator set with simple description is provided to the optim agent, it can select any combination of operators with their simple parameters as the action. After action, optim agent obtain the feedback information, e.g., performance metrics, from UniEnv to continue update its memory and action."}, {"title": "2.3.2 Parameter Optimization", "content": "The action space of parameter optimization is defined based on the parameters of model itself. We define a parameter configuration file for each model, the optim agent reads the configuration file and generates code as the action to update the parameters in it. To better understand the meaning of each parameter, we add comments for each parameter in the file. While the action space is large, this kind of action space is flexible to adapt with any models."}, {"title": "2.3.3 Joint Optimization", "content": "Furthermore, we introduce the joint optimization mechanisms in AutOpt to improve the final performance. Due to the different working paradigms, the direct combination of two kinds of optimizations is unsuccessful. We designate the optimization order to prioritize data augmentation first, followed by parameter optimization. This means that once the performance of data augmentation stabilizes, the agent proceeds with parameter optimization. This procedure can be repeated a fixed number of times until it meets the stop criteria."}, {"title": "3 EXPERIMENTS", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the experimental settings, including the datasets, task models, and evaluation metrics.

The results for these tasks are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.\nFor each task, we report the model performance under four different configurations: the original model (Origin), with Data Augmentation (+DA), with Parameter Optimization (+PO), and with joint optimization (+JO).

Specifically, we examined the framework by isolating two main designs: the memory unit and the reflection mechanism, resulting in two variants: 1) w/o Reflection, where the reflection mechanism is removed, and 2) w/o Memory, where the memory unit is excluded. Additionally, it is important to note that GPT-40-mini was used as the base LLM for all variants of TrajAgent in this study. The experimental results are presented in Table 6. We can find that: 1) Removing either component leads to average performance declines, with the memory unit being especially critical for maintaining execution efficiency. For example, removing the memory unit causes significant drops in accuracy for both Data Augmentation (DA) and Parameter Optimization (PO), underscoring its essential role in these processes. 2) Interestingly, removing a component occasionally results in slight increases in success or accuracy, suggesting that some components may introduce overhead or complexity in specific stages. Overall, the combined use of the memory and reflection mechanisms is crucial for optimizing TrajAgent's performance."}, {"title": "3.4 Parameter Study", "content": "In this section, we analyze the effects of two important parameters in the TrajAgent framework: 1) thought step: the number of steps that agent thought before taking action, and 2) memory size: the size of memory units in TrajAgent. To be specific, we vary the values of these parameters to investigate their impact on agent performance, and the results are illustrated in Figure 2(a) and (b). As shown in Figure 2(a), increasing thought steps significantly enhances Joint Optimization (JO) and Data Augmentation (DA). This indicates that giving TrajAgent more reasoning time improves its overall performance. However, the peak performance for Parameter Optimization (PO) and JO at around 10 steps suggests that once sufficient contextual understanding is achieved, further increasing the thought steps provides diminishing returns and may not be beneficial. From Figure 2(b), we find that increasing memory size initially improves performance for JO and DA, with peak accuracy reached at a memory size of 10. This suggests that having sufficient memory allows TrajAgent to store and utilize relevant information effectively. However, beyond this point, performance starts to decline, indicating that excessive memory may introduce unnecessary complexity or irrelevant data, leading to diminished returns for JO and DA. For Parameter Optimization (PO), memory size has little effect, reflecting that this task does not rely as heavily on memory records."}, {"title": "3.5 Case Study", "content": "In this section, we analyze some cases where the TrajAgent's optimization performance is suboptimal. The overall process is illustrated in Figure 3. The optimization module is a key component affecting overall performance.\nThe first issue is optimization trap present in data augmentation module of TrajAgent. Specifically, it refers to the situation where agent sometimes ignores the contents of the memory during the thought process. Even when the chosen parameter combination yields poor training results, the model overlooks the error feedback (i.e., the \"Not good enough...\" in the memory). The \"optimization trap\" occurs even in the best-performing GPT-40-mini. As the length of the Memory increases, the impact of the optimization trap on overall accuracy grows. Once an optimization trap occurs, all memories within the same step tend to favor the same ineffective combination. We believe the causes of the optimization trap could be: (1) excessively long prompts leading to truncated inputs; (2) insufficient proportion of memory in the total input.\nThe second issue is the sub-optimality appears in parameter optimization module of TrajAgent. This phenomenon exists across"}, {"title": "4 RELATED WORK", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Trajectory Modelling and Analytics", "content": "In recent year, trajectory modelling [4, 10, 52] makes great progress on its core research questions, including prediction [7, 19, 27], classification [18, 30], and generation [48].\nTrajectory prediction is to predict the next location or the trip destination of the trajectory. ST-RNN [19] is the first work for applying recurrent neural network into the trajectory prediction task. Following this work, lots of works have been done to solve the critical issues of trajectory prediction with deep learning, for example, DeepMove [7] for multi-granularity regularity modelling, Flash-back [41] for sparse trajectory prediction, GETNext [44] for utilizing aggregated mobility pattern. Besides, to solve the travel time prediction task, another important prediction problem for trajectory modelling, deep learning models including DeepTTE [33], TTPNet [27] and CARTE [12] are proposed and achieve promising performance in various scenarios. As for the classification problem in trajectory modelling, the most well-known tasks are trajectory mode detection [14] and trajectory user linkage [9] task. Various techniques, such as siamese network [8], distillation learning [3] and transformers [18] are successfully applied to discover the pattern among trajectories to solve the classification tasks. Finally, due to the natural limitation of trajectory data quality, trajectory data recovery [38, 40] and generation [23] are also important tasks in trajectory modelling which are crucial for the practical application in the real world. Thus, follow the the trend of generative modelling, diverse generative models including GAN [23], diffusion models [36, 48] are utilized to improve the modelling of human dynamics.\nWhile these specific methods accelerate the development of trajectory modelling from different aspects, they can only handle one type of task. In other words, the unified model for all the trajectory modelling task is still missing due to the heterogeneity of tasks and trajectory data.

Data were collected from 81 participants (mean age: 21.5 \u00b1 9.6 years, range: 18-61 years, women: 77.8%) whose FA and SC were measured using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS).

Analysis of the actimetric data identified significant statistical and entropy-based features that accurately predicted FA and SC using ML. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was the primary metric. Activity-related features were more effective for FA prediction (MCC=0.88) than rest-related features (MCC=0.68). For SC, activity segments yielded MCC=0.47, rest segments MCC=0.38, and their combination MCC=0.51. Significant correlations were also found between actimetric features related to FA, emotional, and restrained eating behaviors, supporting the model's validity.

Introduction", "content": "Obesity is considered a \"disease of civilization\", with its growth rates recently acquiring an epidemic character (James et al., 2001). There is a steady increase in the number of individuals with overweight and obesity in countries with different levels of economic development and among various social and age groups (Chooi et al., 2019). Obesity is a multifactorial disease, with significant contributions from genetic, environmental, and social factors (Hampl et al., 2023). Disordered eating behaviors are also a notable risk factor for obesity (Lister et al., 2023). Obesity is associated with challenges in human resilience to stress and mental health (Meigal et al., 2023). These challenges can be addressed through advances in Machine Learning (ML) and smart sensor technology within the Internet of Things (IoT) (Korzun, 2017).\nCurrently, the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) identifies three primary eating disorders: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The latest edition also proposes the inclusion of food addiction (FA) as a distinct disorder. The Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS; Gearhardt et al., 2009, 2013) and its modified version (YFAS 2.0; Schulte & Gearhardt, 2017) are used to assess FA.\nThe YFAS measures addiction-like eating of palatable foods based on the seven diagnostic criteria for substance dependence in the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (Meule et al., 2017). Numerous studies conducted in both general and clinical populations have noted a connection between FA and BMI (Gearhardt et al., 2013) and between FA and depression (Borisenkov et al., 2020). Experimental studies have identified objective neuroimaging correlates of FA (Gearhardt et al., 2011).\nHowever, some authors highlight difficulties in interpreting FA test results. Several studies have found no significant association between FA and BMI (Gearhardt et al., 2011). In some cases, FA symptoms are identified in individuals without signs of weight disorders (Borisenkov et al., 2018), as well as in underweight individuals (Schulte & Gearhardt, 2018). It has been suggested (Gearhardt et al., 2011) that YFAS can identify disordered eating behaviors before the onset of morphological signs of obesity. However, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nFA has been shown to have a close relationship with AN, BN, and BED (Meule & Gearhardt, 2019), and there is also considerable overlap between the criteria for FA and BED (Burrows et al., 2017), complicating their differential diagnosis. Consequently, some experts question the necessity of recognizing FA as a separate eating disorder (Ziauddeen et al., 2012). Other researchers (Meule et al., 2014) argue that further development of the FA concept requires improving the differential diagnosis system for eating disorders based on longitudinal study results.\nThe diagnosis of eating disorders such as FA (Figure 1a) is often limited to questionnaire-based methods, which significantly reduce diagnostic accuracy (Meule & Gearhardt, 2014). Introducing simple and objective assessment methods for these disorders represents a crucial step in developing the FA concept. Direct and objective evaluation of the brain centers responsible for eating behavior requires costly equipment like functional magnetic resonance imaging, making it unsuitable for long-term studies. Instead, chronobiology methods, such as continuous monitoring of physiological indicators (body temperature and motor activity), are more effective, following the concept of human bionic suite composed of smart IoT devices and sensors (Korzun, 2017; Korzun & Meigal, 2019). Although these methods assess parameters not directly related to eating behavior, they have already been applied in this field.\nThe actimetry method (Figure 1b) has been extensively used to study the 24-hour behavioral rhythms of patients with eating disorders, such as BED (Jones et al., 2005; Roveda et al., 2018). Literature suggests that dysfunction of the circadian system plays a key role in the etiology of BED (Romo-Nava et al., 2022). Given the strong connections between the circadian system and eating behavior (Mistlberger & Antle, 2011; Wehrens et al., 2017), it is expected that other forms of eating disorders are also associated with circadian system dysfunction.\nIn our previous study, we identified a direct link between the number of FA symptoms, the mean level (MESOR), and fragmentation (intradaily variability, I.V.) of circadian motor activity (Borisenkov et al., 2022). These indicators could potentially differentiate between FA and BED diagnoses (Borisenkov et al., 2022).\nCurrently, actimetry is mainly used in chronobiology and sleep medicine, including detecting sleep disorders. For example, early-stage Alzheimer's disease shows increased fragmentation and decreased stability in daily activity-rest rhythms (Musiek et al., 2018). Recent advancements include applying ML to automate actimetry data analysis in sleep medicine and chronobiology (Li et al., 2020; Meteier et al., 2024; Rani et al., 2022). ML methods have been used for assessing driver drowsiness (Meteier et al., 2024), detecting chronic insomnia (Rani et al., 2022), and analyzing rest-activity rhythms (Li et al., 2020). However, literature lacks ML applications for assessing eating behavior based on actimetry data."}, {"title": "2.

Change points identified transitions between different types of activity or rest phases.\nThe threshold method, with a global threshold set at three-quarters of the median of the actimetric curve, was used to classify segments.

All activity segments from the actimetric data were selected (A1, A2, A3... An), as shown in Figure 2. The A segments are time series of varying lengths.\n2. For each time series segment, a statistical or entropy feature was calculated, resulting in another time series composed of these metrics. For example, TS = FuzzyEn(A1), FuzzyEn(A2), FuzzyEn(A3)...FuzzyEn(An). Thus, a set of TS values was formed for each method and segment for each participant.\n3. The obtained TS values for each method were aggregated using the mean (Mean(TS)) and standard deviation (Std(TS)) functions.\nA similar procedure was conducted for the rest segments (Group 2). Consequently, each statistical and entropy method produced four features: mean and standard deviation for the activity segments, as well as mean and standard deviation for the rest segments.\nIt is also important to note that various parameter sets were used for the entropy calculation methods to accurately characterize the dynamics of changes in participants' activity.

The primary goal of this study was to identify the most significant actimetric features and their combinations for classifying FA and SC.

Notably, there were also significant correlations with restrained eating behavior, emphasizing its relevance to FA diagnosis (Rios et al., 2023).\nWe observed only one significant correlation between an actimetric feature for FA and BMI%, related to activity segments, which aligns with prior studies showing either a lack of or nonlinear relationship between FA and anthropometric characteristics (Schulte & Gearhardt, 2018).\nOur study did not find significant correlations between FA and depression, contrary to earlier research suggesting a strong link (Borisenkov et al., 2020).

This is further evident in the optimal combinations of actimetric features (Tables 6 and 11). Combining features from activity and rest segments either does not improve the MCC metric or results in only slight gains. Thus, daytime activity alone is sufficient for classifying FA and SC.\nComparing OaS (Tables 1 and 2) and actimetric features for FA (Tables 3-6) and SC (Tables 8-11) classification shows that actimetric features enable more accurate classification. For SC, the maximum MCC values are close: MCC=0.29 (actimetry) vs. MCC=0.25 (OaS features) for individual features, and MCC=0.51 (actimetry) vs. MCC=0.46 (OaS features) for optimal combinations. For FA, the difference is more pronounced: MCC=0.62 (actimetry) vs. MCC=0.42 (OaS features) for individual features, and MCC=0.88 (actimetry) vs. MCC=0.75 (OaS features) for optimal combinations.\nThe maximum MCC values for SC are significantly lower than for FA, likely due to more classes (4 for SC vs. 2 for FA) and difficulty in classifying SC classes {2,3} (Tables 12 and 13).

This highlights the need for further research and the integration of objective motor activity data into diagnostic algorithms for better assessment of eating disorders. However, the study has limitations, including a small sample size, gender imbalance, and a cross-sectional design that prevents conclusions about causal relationships."}, {"title": "5. Conclusion and Future Directions", "content": "This study demonstrated that combining actimetric data with ML enables the creation of a model that accurately reflects the relationship between food addiction and psychophysiological characteristics. Our findings suggest that the identified actimetric features can serve as objective criteria for FA, highlighting the potential of using actimetric data for developing objective diagnostic methods for eating disorders. Actimetric features also allow for more accurate classification of FA and SC compared to traditional features, with daily activity analysis being sufficient for classification.\nFuture research should combine subjective and objective methods to enhance actimetric data analysis, aiming to uncover hidden patterns related to eating disorders. Key future steps include evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FA diagnosis in a double-blind experiment, testing the methodology with a larger sample size, assessing effectiveness in small ethnic groups, and conducting longitudinal studies to evaluate the method's potential for mass screening. Recent advancements in wearable technologies and actigraphy have incorporated light sensors (Danilenko et al., 2022), enabling the expansion of data analyses to circadian patterns of light exposure that associate with metabolic issues (Kim et al., 2023; Gubin et al., 2024) and via mechanisms of circadian disruption can be related to food addiction and eating disorders including binge eating and night eating (Plano et al., 2022).\nIn line with the concept of a human bionic suite, IoT technology can enhance monitoring and analysis capabilities by providing real-time data on human motor activity. Real-time data processing and ML sensors could improve the reliability and accuracy of diagnoses, particularly in cases where traditional methods fall short. These promising results indicate that wearable IoT devices are effective in analyzing physiological indicators related to FA and SC within digital health assistance, and in supporting human resilience to stress and mental health challenges. Future research will focus on IoT integration and the refinement of ML algorithms to develop advanced tools for diagnosing and managing eating disorders, aiming for a more precise and personalized diagnostic approach."}]}

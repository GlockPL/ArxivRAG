INTRODUCTION", "content": "In recent years, intensive discussions and studies on Industry 5.0 [1]\u2013[4] have emerged, capturing the attention of researchers, entrepreneurs, and policymakers across diverse sectors worldwide. In fact, Industry 5.0 related academic papers and technical reports can be traced back to Prof. Wang's works on Parallel Intelligence (PI) [5]\u2013[7] and Intelligent Industries in 2000s [8]. Since then, Prof. Wang and his team have been dedicated to developing a theory with implementable frameworks and systematic processes, aimed at facilitating the realization of Industry 5.0 [9], where the core is PI. The PI framework provides a solid methodological foundation to make complex systems computable, testable, verifiable, and ultimately controllable. Consequently, by considering PI as a technical means and cyber-physical-social systems (CPSSs) as an infrastructure, the progression towards Industry 5.0 becomes feasible [10].\nAs data and information is crucial in industrial activities, intelligent sensing approaches [11], especially crowdsensing [12], [13] and spatial crowdsourcing [14], have been extensively employed across various stages of industrial processes (e.g., design, production, logistics, and user feedback), emerging as foundation elements of Industrial 4.0. However, in the era of Industrial 5.0, with human and social factors being introduced, the industrial systems (typical CPSSs) face some issues: excessive human involvement, lack of flexibility, and inefficient human-computer interaction [15]. Simultaneously, with the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and social media, coupled with the widespread use of mobile devices, vast amounts of data are being generated almost instantaneously from not only physical space but also cyber and social spaces. Consequently, traditional crowdsensing encounters challenges in adapting to the transition from CPS-based Industry 4.0 to CPSS-based Industry 5.0. Therefore, an urgent need arises for a suite of intelligent sensing schemes that can effectively capture the dynamic characteristics of Industry 5.0 across cyber, physical, and social spaces.\nThe recent advancement in PI has inspired researchers to propose the concept of Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) [16]\u2013[19]. Through the deep integration of robotic, biological, and digital participants [20]\u2013[23], CSI leverages their diverse sensing abilities, complementary computing resources, and cross-space collaboration to build a decentralized, self-organizing, self-learning, and continuously evolving intelligent sensing and computing space. In this space, individual skills and collective cognitive ability can be enhanced to facilitate the guidance and control of the actual system [24]. The initial exploration of CSI can be traced back to the rudiment CCEC-PTS framework [16] which integrates heterogeneous sensing resources in social transportation and collects associated data from different spaces. The formal exploration of CSI was launched by Professor Wang Fei-Yue and Chen Bin in the ongoing DHW-CSI. The previous workshops on CSI have primarily focused on the DAO-based architecture [25], [26] and fundamental components of CSI, such as participants, methods, and stages [18].\nTo achieve PI-based CSI, three important cornerstones are utilized. 1) The first c ornerstone is the organization and operation of three types of workers: biological (~5%), digital (~80%), and robotic (~15%). To enable three types of workers to perform a diverse range of sensing tasks with greater autonomy and intelligence, the technology of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and Operations (DAO) should be applied. DAO facilitates the formation of distributed, decentralized, autonomous, automated, organized, and resilient crowdsensing communities by assembling individuals who share common objectives, driven by specific m echanisms for value creation and incentive distribution. It enables collective decision-making and resource management among a heterogeneous workforce. 2) The second cornerstone is three kinds of operation modes supported by three types of workers, namely autonomous, parallel, and expert/emergency modes. Autonomous modes serve as the primary mode of operations, where activities are executed in an automated manner, mainly with the participation of digital and robotic humans. If an anomaly occurs, parallel modes are activated to enable remote access for biological humans, allowing them to work with other workers to resolve the problems. However, if the problem cannot be solved by parallel modes, emergency mode will be triggered, prompting the dispatch of related experts to directly address the situation. After the anomaly is solved, the operation mode will gradually cascade to autonomous modes. 3) The third cornerstone includes foundation models [27], scenarios engineering (SE) [28], and Human-Oriented Operating Systems (HOOS) [29]. Foundation models possess strong capabilities to solve various downstream sensing tasks, and can be recognized as the core of CSI. Scenarios engineering performs fine-tuning a nd v alidation o f foundation models in specific s cenarios t o g uarantee t he interpretability and reliability of CSI. Furthermore, HOOS facilitates seamless communication and interaction between biological workers and digital or robotic workers, reducing laborious work and related physical and mental burdens of biological workers.\nPromoted by these three cornerstones, CSI is now transitioning from algorithmic intelligence to linguistic intelligence, with the prosperity of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT [10], [30]. Natural language serves as a vital communication channel among diverse workforce in crowdsensing, and we believe that a novel 'conversational crowdsensing' paradigm represents an ideal form of linguistic intelligence for Industry 5.0, thereby facilitating the emergence of universally applicable and reliable foundational intelligence. In this survey, three levels of conversation during three sensing phases are devised to foster collaboration among three communities of workers in terms of the diverse sensing demands of various industrial activities across different scenarios, with the aim of achieving the '6S' goals of Safety, Security, Sustainability, Sensitivity, Smartness, and Services [31]\u2013[33]. The core idea revolves around the design of LLM-based multi-agent systems with clearly defined r oles a nd t he i ntegration o f Human-AI cooperation technology (to enhance credibility and security). Furthermore, we incorporate SE technologies to train and evaluate Al agents, aiming at enhancing the resilience and dependability of conversational crowdsensing.\nIn particular, the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1) Proposing conversational crowdsensing: we identify the limitations of current crowdsensing methods when applied in the context of Industry 5.0 and propose conversational crowdsensing, a PI-powerd sensing approach that represents a specific form of crowdsensing in the stage of linguistic intelligence. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as DAO, LLMs, SE, and HOOS, three types of participants collaborate and coordinate in conversational crowdsensing to form a more autonomous and intelligent sensing pattern through natural language.\n2) Devising the architecture: we design a '3&3&3' architecture of conversational crowdsensing, including three communities, three conversation levels, and three sensing phases. Specific roles with their respective embodied functions or activities is dedicatedly devised and organized in Human, AI, and Robot communities. Through three levels of effective conversation using nature language (i.e., inter-human, human-AI, and inter-AI), diverse tasks including information exchange, data transmission, and problem report are cooperatively accomplished by diverse workforce in three sensing stages.\n3) Investigating the implementation scheme of underpinning technologies: we investigate the scheme of three underpinning technologies of for the successful implementation of conversational crowdsensing, including LLM-based multi-agent systems, conversational human-Al cooperation, and scenarios engineering. Regarding LLM-based multi-agent systems, we design a general framework for LLM-based conversable agent and introduce the DAO-based autonomous workflow control. The scenarios engineering approach based on parallel intelligence is designed to facilitate the acquisition of task completion capabilities by AI agents through fine-tuning. Moreover, we explore organization forms, interaction modes, and conversation designs of conversational human-AI cooperation to ensure the better cooperation between human participants and AI participants.\n4) Prospecting future applications: we reveal the potential applications of conversational crowdsensing in various domains during the Industry 5.0 era, such as smarting mining, disaster prediction, and personal health monitoring, and provide the prototype implementation scheme."}, {"title": "II. PRELIMINARY", "content": "In this section, we discuss the preliminary works from three aspects: (1) burgeoning parallel intelligence, (2) parallel intelligence powered crowdsensing, and (3) conversational crowdsourcing."}, {"title": "A. Burgeoning Parallel Intelligence", "content": "The emergence of parallel intelligence is accompanied by the transition from traditional Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) [34]. In comparison to CPS, CPSS involves the additional integration of diverse and complex human and social behaviors, posing challenges in building accurate models of actual systems, which is also known as the cognitive gap [35]. In 2004, Professor Fei-Yue Wang proposed the parallel system method [36] to describe and operate various entities in CPSS, of which the core is the ACP approach encompassing Artificial systems, Computational experiments, and Parallel execution [37]. This pioneering work delved into the realm of parallel intelligence, where parallel systems relate to composite systems comprising an actual system and one or more corresponding virtual artificial s ystems. W ith the a dvancement of artificial intelligence, the parallel system method continues to evolve towards intelligence, leading to the formal introduction of the concept of parallel intelligence in 2016 [5]. This concept has become the objective of parallel system methods, which aims to establish a cycle of data, knowledge, and action between the actual and artificial s ystems [38]. This cycle is facilitated by descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive intelligence, which correspond to the three steps of the ACP approach and represent their higher-level abstractions. Parallel intelligence enables the seamless feedback and interaction between the actual and artificial s ystems, o ffering significant potential for addressing challenges in modeling, analysis, management, and control within CPSS [39]. Currently, parallel intelligence has already been successfully applied in various domains, such as industry [40], [41], transportation [42]\u2013[44], agriculture [45], sensing systems [19], [46], [47], and even artistic creation [48]. Most importantly, with the continuous development of concepts and technologies such as DAO [30], [49]\u2013[51], Metaverse [24], [31] and foundation models [15], [21], [52]\u2013[54], the connotation of parallel intelligence would undergo continuous evolution and updates."}, {"title": "B. Parallel Intelligence powered Crowdsensing", "content": "Crowdsensing, as an emerging sensing paradigm, leverages the collective intelligence of individuals and organizations to acquire data for addressing urban-scale monitoring needs [12], [13], [55]. However, the expansion of complex sensing campaigns has brought forth a multitude of challenges for crowdsensing, such as substantial human efforts, inflexible organizational structure, sluggish system response, and limited application popularization. In this context, a novel generation of crowdsensing is required for enabling trustworthy, intelligent, interactive, collaborative, and autonomous sensing & computing [19]. The recent advancements give rise to the parallel intelligence powered crowdsensing, namely Crowdsensing Intelligence (CSI) [17]. By organizing Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshops on Crowdsensing Intelligence (DHW-CSI), we aim to gain preliminary insights into its framework, participants, implementation methods, and development stages. The previous workshops on CSI have primarily focused on the DAO-based architecture [25], [26] and fundamental components of CSI [18], such as participants, methods, and stages. In the latest DHW-CSI, a concrete form of CSI, namely autonomous crowdsensing (ACS), was explored [56]. ACS organizes both professional sensing resources (e.g., satellites, IoT nodes, smart vehicles) and non-professional sensing resources (e.g., humans with smart devices) in the form of the DAO with the goal of sensing automation. By leveraging the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs [57], [58], digital and robotic participants can largely replace human labor in sensing tasks through a fresh 'conversational' mode [20]- [23], thereby minimizing reliance on human involvement. This would facilitate ACS to quickly respond to diverse sensing data demands and lower the cognitive and execution barriers for human participants. In addition, the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like scenarios engineering [28], [59]\u2013[63], federated intelligence [64], and human-oriented operating systems [29] also contributes to the transition from traditional crowdsensing to ACS. With the progressive advancement of AI agent technology [65], this trend is increasingly becoming feasible."}, {"title": "C. Conversational Crowdsourcing", "content": "The concept of conversational crowdsourcing originated in prior research that combined crowdsourcing and conversational agents [66] to achieve various goals, such as facilitating human-computer cooperative work [67], [68], training dialogue managers [69], improving user experiences [70], and acquiring knowledge from humans [71].\nConversational crowdsourcing was formally proposed in 2020 [72]. It features a conversational agent, which is capable of giving task instructions and asking questions by conversing with crowd workers, on the crowdsourcing task execution interface. A series of studies have been conducted to investigate different aspects of conversational crowdsourcing [73]\u2013[76]. For instance, previous work on human-computer interaction focused on the effectiveness of using conversational crowdsourcing to improve user engagement and retention [73]. The findings showed that online participants who completed crowdsourcing tasks with a conversational agent were significantly more engaged and stayed significantly longer on task execution. An extended study of this work further showed that giving agents different conversational styles could affect the quality of crowdsourcing outcomes [74]. More recent works looked into visual representations and metaphorical representations of conversational agents (and their AI), and attempted to find more effective, efficient, healthy, and sustainable relationships between humans and AI in conversational crowdsourcing [75], [76].\nIn recent years, conversational crowdsourcing has been serving a variety of applications such as wellbeing check, mental therapy, building trust in decision support systems, enhancing human memorability in information retrieval [77]\u2013[80]. Although crowdsensing is considered to be an important domain application of general crowdsourcing, effectively enabling conversations in crowdsensing activities is still an unexplored research gap."}, {"title": "III. ARCHITECTURE OF CONVERSATIONAL CROWDSENSING", "content": "The proposed conversational crowdsensing architecture, as depicted in Fig. 1, encompasses a range of roles with their respective embodied functions or activities. These roles are organized in human, AI, and Robot communities and engage in information exchange, data transmission, and communication using nature language in the conversational manner to cooperatively complete crowdsensing campaigns. Specifically, the architecture includes three levels of conversations: Inter-human, Human-AI, and Inter-AI conversations, as well as three phases of the entire campaign: Requesting, Scheduling, and Executing. In this section, we mainly present the composition of three communities and three levels of conversations. In the next section, we discuss the specific details of the three phases of conversational crowdsensing campaign."}, {"title": "A. Three Communities in Conversational Crowdsensing", "content": "The elements involved in crowdsensing campaigns encompass humans, sensing vehicles, IoT sensing nodes, as well as diverse algorithms and software. Traditional crowdsensing typically operates within a human-centric architecture where humans organize and participant in major activities such as microtask design and sensing plan development. Due to the limited capacity of human beings, this traditional architecture hampers the response speed of sensing activities and imposes high demands on human expertise and skills. Therefore, by leveraging LLMs-based AI agents as the core, we propose organizing conversational crowdsensing to alleviate human workload and professional requirements, thereby enhancing the level of automation in crowdsensing campaigns. Specifically, we reorganize elements of crowdsensing into the human, AI, and Robot communities.\n1) Human community: The human community serves as the earliest and fundamental entity in crowdsensing campaigns. Human beings not only initiate and derive benefits from these campaigns, but also actively participate as workers. Distinguishing itself from traditional crowdsensing frameworks that solely consist of requesters and workers, we primarily introduce four distinct roles within the human community. Requesters are responsible for providing needs to drive the campaign toward a specific purpose. Different human needs require diverse task designs to respond, encompassing essential resources, microtask descriptions, and so forth. Schedulers are responsible for providing specific campaign goals and budgets to facilitate the determination of sensing plans. Amateurish workers can complete microtasks with the help of Al agents and submit the results, without necessitating any specialized expertise or capabilities. Their sole requirement is to employ their unique human capacity for recognition, reasoning, and device operation. In a city-centric sensing scenario, the widespread presence amateurish workers render them invaluable practitioners of microtasks. Proficient workers are highly skilled workers with specialized knowledge and expertise, capable of resolving intricate problems that cannot be addressed by AI. It should be noted that individuals in the human community can assume multiple roles simultaneously, such as being both a requester and a worker. Besides, with the assistance of AI agents, amateurish workers can quickly improve themselves to proficient workers.\n2) Al community: The design of the Al community serves as the core for conversational crowdsensing, encompassing a diverse range of roles fulfilled by LLM-based agents to assist humans in accomplishing various tasks, such as designing microtasks and making sensing plans. Moreover, it facilitates the automation of campaign operations and executions. We primarily present eight roles of LLM-based agents, i.e., AI designers, workers, critics, strategists, assistants, managers, reporters, and supervisors, all of which correspond to an task and possess the capability to exchange messages for information transmission with other agents/humans, as shown in Table I. Some of these roles also have the ability to execute tools through code or function execution [81]. For example, AI Strategists can extract human goals and budgets during conversations with schedulers and convert them into structured optimization problems. Furthermore, they can leverage relevant tools to solve these problems and transform the results into executable sensing plans [82], [83]. AI worker is a universal role capable of executing tasks in virtual scenarios to acquire performance evaluations for the designed microtasks and plans, or in the physical world by collaborating with embodied workers within the robot community.\n3) Robot community: The robot community plays a crucial role in conversational crowdsensing, enabling Al workers to significantly enhance their capabilities and expand their business scope through embodied workers. This allows the plans formulated by the AI community to be effectively and automatically implemented in the physical world. The distinction made here is between embodied workers and traditional robot workers: robot workers may possess a certain level of autonomous planning and collaboration capabilities, often enabled by embedded algorithms and software. As a contrast, embodied workers in conversational crowdsensing serve as physical actuators while being equipped with corresponding AI workers from the AI community to provide guidance for their behavior. This facilitates the development of unified and scalable AI and robot communities, despite the heterogeneity of robot types, interfaces, parameters, etc. Therefore, the cooperation between embodied workers remains fundamentally a collaboration among AI workers. The embodied workers can seek assistance from human experts (proficient workers) through AI workers when they encounter difficulties during task execution, or alternatively, they can opt for remote takeover by human experts, a mode commonly referred to as parallel mode."}, {"title": "B. Three levels of Conversation", "content": "The inter and intra communications among the three communities are conducted through conversational means, primarily encompassing Inter-human conversations, Human-AI conversations, and Inter-Al conversations at three distinct levels. It is worth noting that we have disregarded Inter-robot conversations and robot-human/AI conversations since robots fundamentally rely on AI workers to communicate with other entities.\n1) Inter-human conversations: The inter-human conversations serve as the most rudimentary form of linguistic communication, playing a pivotal role in crowdsensing campaigns. Particularly for intricate tasks, human workers can directly engage with requesters to acquire precise instructions or requirements pertaining to the task at hand, thereby ensuring alignment of objectives between them. Inter-human conversations ensure the non-destructive transmission of information and prevents information deviations caused by automated task design and planning processes. The traditional frameworks for crowdsensing typically require the avoidance of inter-human communication, to protect human privacy and ensure that each worker independently uploads high-quality data without being influenced by others. In contrast, conversational crowdsensing facilitates efficient information exchange, effective collaboration, and idea sharing among humans, enabling them to tackle more complex tasks. In addition, previous studies have noticed unhealthy relationships between requesters and workers. Particularly, workers have to shoulder a lot of invisible labor without being paid [84]\u2013[86]. A major cause is considered to be the lack of a dialogue platform/mechanism where requesters and workers can equally change ideas with each other and discuss affairs regarding either high-level regulations or specific tasks. Such a platform could facilitate the formation of worker unions for online crowdsensing marketplaces, thus protecting the rights of human participants and ensuring that human workers are not manipulated by AI [87].\n2) Human-Al conversations: The current advancement of LLMs enhances the natural language comprehension and output capabilities of Al agents, facilitating seamless and continuous communication between humans and AI. The conversational interaction, as compared to traditional human-computer interaction interfaces, offers a more natural and intuitive experience. It diminishes the reliance on specific technical knowledge and operational skills, allowing humans to focus their efforts on expressing needs and problems while efficiently obtaining information through instant Al feedback. This presents an excellent opportunity for non-professionals to engage in crowdsensing campaigns. Moreover, personalized Al agent customizations enhance conversational alignment with individuals' language habits and expressions, thereby augmenting human engagement and acceptance [73], [74]. In conversational crowdsensing, humans engage in microtask design and sensing plan formulation through dialogue with AI agents while receiving guidance during the sensing & reporting phase. Moreover, while current LLM-based agents possess remarkable capabilities for reasoning, thinking, and utilizing tools, and are increasingly excelling in various automated tasks, it remains crucial to assess the risks and feasibility of Al agents independently accomplishing diverse tasks. Consequently, ensuring an effective and appropriate level of human supervision becomes exceedingly significant. Conversational crowdsensing provides an interface for human interventions in addressing challenges that Al agents are unable to tackle independently, primarily through engaging in human-AI conversations. In general, through conversations, humans and Al agents can achieve efficient information exchange and complementary capabilities, so as to complete complex tasks in crowdsensing campaigns.\n3) Inter-Al conversations: Through the acquisition of extensive web knowledge, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable potential in achieving human-level intelligence [88]. This progress has inspired researchers to develop methods for facilitating cooperative interactions among multiple Al agents through conversation. The utilization of multiple LLM-based agents has been shown in prior research to facilitate divergent thinking, enhance factuality and reasoning, provide validation, and mitigate the risk of hallucination [81]. Specifically, multiple LLM-based agents can be customized with distinct roles and embedded with specific functional tools. They then engage in conversation for information exchange and the completion of atomic tasks, enabling the automated resolution of complex tasks. The conversation pattern between agents can be static. For instance, Chen et al. [89] devised a chat chain to facilitate the automation of software development involving multiple roles such as CEO, CTO, Programmer, and Tester. Each role collaborates through dialogue to sequentially accomplish discrete tasks including Designing, Coding, Testing, and Documenting. The conversation mode can also be dynamic. For instance, Wu et al. [81] developed AutoGen, a multi-agent cooperative framework that incorporates the GroupChatManager module to facilitate complex and dynamic group conversations with dynamically selected speakers. These studies typically involve conducting multi-turn inter-AI conversations until termination conditions are met. Inter-AI conversations, in general, enable the automated execution of tasks or processes that would otherwise necessitate human efforts to connect them together. In conversational crowdsensing, we leverage inter-AI conversations to automate task design, plan creation, task assignment, and other related activities, thereby significantly enhancing the speed at which requesters' needs are addressed."}, {"title": "IV. THREE PHASES OF CONVERSATIONAL CROWDSENSING", "content": "The process of conversational crowdsensing consists of three phases: requesting, scheduling, and executing. The primary objective of the requesting phase is to transmit human natural language (NL) based needs into executable microtasks by determining their fundamental form and descriptions. The primary objective of the scheduling phase is to devise a sensing plan that adheres to the constraints imposed by the goals and budgets of the crowdsensing campaign, specifically involving the allocation of multiple microtasks among workers with diverse attributes such as capability, cost, and reputation. The primary objective of the executing phase is to organize workers in carrying out their respective microtasks as per the sensing plan, while also collecting results for generating comprehensive reports and providing feedback to requesters. This section mainly introduces the main process of conversational crowdsensing in three phases with the joint participation of humans, Al agents and robots."}, {"title": "A. Requesting phase", "content": "In the requesting phase, requesters will express their needs to Al designers in a conversational manner, while AI designers promptly respond by providing viable and high-quality microtask designs for humans. The design of microtasks is a highly specialized task that was predominantly carried out by humans in the previous crowdsensing frameworks. Specifically, it entails creating a clear microtask description with sufficient information, typically combining a concise title with detailed instructions [90]. In general, the instructions should be clear and comprehensible, providing adequate guidance on the microtasks to be performed and the methods to be employed. High-quality microtask design has the potential to enhance worker engagement, task completion rates, and overall satisfaction [73]. However, the design of high-quality microtasks poses a significant challenge even for human designers due to their limited understanding of the diverse demographics and abilities of potential workers. To enhance the performance of Al designers, we have introduced two types of Al roles AI workers and AI critics to collaboratively accomplish microtask design tasks at this phase.\nWhen receiving human needs, AI designers will initially utilize the understanding and generation capabilities of the LLMs to generate a few preliminary schemes for microtask designs. Subsequently, these diverse design schemes are dispatched to AI workers who attempt to execute microtasks within virtual scenarios based on the provided descriptions. These AI workers can be preconfigured with varied knowledge backgrounds and abilities in order to yield distinct performances. Subsequently, AI critics consolidate these performances and assess the microtask design. This process can be implemented through a group chat dialogue, where distinct AI critics can be assigned to focus on various aspects such as validity, usability, etc. Following deliberation, the AI critics provide feedback to the AI designers regarding the preliminary schemes in order to facilitate the generation of higher quality microtask designs. The microtask design undergoes iterative refinement through this process. Following multiple iterations, AI designers provide feedback to the requesters and determine whether further improvement are necessary based on human input.\nThe requesting phase fully leverages the understanding and generation capabilities of LLM-based agents, as well as their collaborative abilities to accomplish complex tasks. Additionally, virtual scenarios are provided for Al workers to efficiently and effectively evaluate microtask designs. These virtual scenarios can be constructed through scenario engineering to ensure the achievement of '6S' goals."}, {"title": "B. Scheduling phase", "content": "The execution of crowdsensing campaigns typically adheres to the constraints imposed by goals and budgets. These goals encompass requirements for data quality, spatio-temporal scale, and more, while budgets primarily involve cost limitations. Consequently, during the scheduling phase, a sensing plan must be devised based on these objectives and financial considerations. This includes determining a list of micro- tasks, selecting suitable workers, and assigning the microtasks to them. In conversational crowdsensing, AI strategists are responsible for developing a comprehensive sensing plan. Similar to the requesting phase, in order to enhance the output quality of these AI strategists, we have equipped them with both Al workers and AI critics. The AI workers execute sensing plans in virtual scenarios, which are then evaluated by the Al critics. The feedback provided by the AI critics is utilized by the AI strategists to refine and improve the overall quality of their sensing plan.\nThe development of sensing plans is a crucial research direction in crowdsensing research, particularly focusing on the challenging issue of microtask assignment. This problem can typically be formulated as an optimization problem and is commonly known to be NP-hard. Recent research utilizing LLMs as optimizers for completing optimization tasks has provided us with viable approaches to constructing AI strategists [82]. Firstly, the task assignment problem can be formalized based on the LLMs' comprehension abilities, and subsequently corresponding tools such as the LLM-driven evolutionary algorithm can be employed to solve the problem [83]. Although current exploratory work is still in its preliminary stages, we are able to recognize its potential."}, {"title": "C. Executing phase", "content": "The executing phase encompasses various Al roles, with AI managers serving as the linchpin of this phase by orchestrating the entire crowdsensing campaign. Specifically, upon receiving the sensing plan and microtask design, Al managers will undertake precise microtask allocation and collect the results for Al reporters. The execution of microtasks can be divided into three modes, namely autonomous, parallel, and emergency modes. These modes involve the joint participation of human, AI, and embodied workers [18]. In autonomous mode, the majority of microtasks will be executed by Al workers to facilitate sensing automation. Al workers are capable of accomplishing specific types of microtasks in cyberspace, such as network information collection, image labeling, document writing, and more. Furthermore, Al workers can direct embodied workers to complete microtasks in the physical space. In order to ensure the trustworthiness and security of AI workers' behaviors during the execution of microtasks, the conversational crowdsensing system employs AI supervisors to monitor the conduct of AI workers, enabling timely detection of any encountered issues. Upon identification of a problem, the parallel mode is activated, prompting Al supervisors to seek assistance from proficient human workers by explaining the encountered issue and providing potential solutions. T The Al supervisors acquired the solution through deliberation with proficient workers and directed the AI workers in resolving the issues. In cases where a problem persists unresolved in parallel mode, emergency mode will be activated, enabling micro-tasks to be assigned to Al assistants who can guide human workers in completing them. AI assistants will generate more comprehensive and tailored instructions based on microtask descriptions and the individual characteristics of workers. As a result, even individuals without specialized knowledge or abilities can successfully complete microtasks with the help of Al assistants.\nThe Al reporters have the capability to aggregate the results of microtasks and generate real-time summary reports during the execution of such tasks. These reports can be sent to Al managers for effective monitoring of ongoing sensing campaigns or to requesters for prompt response to their requirements."}, {"title": "V.

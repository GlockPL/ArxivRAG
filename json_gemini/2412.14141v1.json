However, recent work using Large Language Models (LLMs) for research idea generation often overlooks these theoretical foundations. We present a framework that explicitly implements combinatorial creativity theory using LLMs, featuring a generalization-level retrieval system for cross-domain knowledge discovery and a structured combinatorial process for idea generation. The retrieval system maps concepts across different abstraction levels to enable meaningful connections between disparate domains, while the combinatorial process systematically analyzes and recombines components to generate novel solutions. Experiments on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, consistently outperforming baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments (improving similarity scores by 7%-10% across multiple metrics). Our results provide strong evidence that LLMs can effectively realize combinatorial creativity when guided by appropriate theoretical frameworks, contributing both to practical advancement of AI-assisted research and theoretical understanding of machine creativity.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The ability to generate creative ideas is fundamental to human progress, spanning domains from scientific discovery to artistic expression. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented opportunities for computational systems to engage in creative processes. Recent work has shown promising results in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for creative idea generation (Si et al. [2024], Kumar et al. [2024], Wang et al. [2023]) However, these approaches often lack grounding in established theories of computational creativity, potentially limiting their effectiveness as well as their future development. For example, they only care about the novelty of the generated idea, however, novelty is meaningless if it is valueless. To address this gap, we emphasize the importance of guiding LLMs' ideation process through computational creativity theory, particularly Boden's framework of combinatorial creativity (Boden [2004]) which describes how novel ideas emerge from combining existing concepts in unexpected ways."}, {"title": "2 Related work", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1 Computational creativity", "content": "The study of creativity has been systematically organized through the \"Four P's\" framework (Rhodes [1961]), which provides distinct yet interconnected perspectives for understanding creative phenomena: Person, Process, Product, and Press."}, {"title": "2.1.1 Person", "content": "The Person perspective examines the characteristics of the creative agent, whether human or computational. This view focuses on identifying what traits or capabilities enable creative behavior, which has become increasingly relevant as AI systems take on creative tasks (Jordanous [2016])."}, {"title": "2.1.2 Process", "content": "The Process perspective encompasses theories about how creative products are generated - specifically examining the cognitive steps and mechanisms involved in creative activities. While many of these theories were originally developed through studying human creativity, they provide valuable frameworks for computational systems.\nOne of the most influential process theories in computational creativity is Boden's theory of conceptual space, which delineates three types of creativity: combinatorial, exploratory, and transformational. Combinatorial creativity involves connecting familiar ideas in novel ways - a mechanism particularly well-suited to LLMs given their ability to identify and recombine patterns across vast knowledge spaces. Exploratory creativity involves discovering new possibilities within an established conceptual space by testing rule implications, while transformational creativity fundamentally alters the rules to reach previously inaccessible points (Boden [2004], Wiggins [2006]).\nThe creative process is often conceptualized through iterative frameworks that alternate between generation and evaluation phases. The Geneplore model (Ward et al. [1999]) involves generating \"preinventive structures\" through synthesis, transformation, or exemplar retrieval, followed by evaluation and exploration of their properties. Similarly, the Engagement-Reflection (ER) model (Sharpies [2013]) alternates between brainstorming ideas (Engagement) and evaluating their validity (Reflection). These iterative frameworks align well with modern computational approaches that combine generation with critical evaluation.\nStage-based theories provide another perspective on the creative process. Wallas' influential four-stage model describes creativity as progressing through preparation (gathering information), incubation (unconscious processing), inspiration (idea emergence), and verification (development and refinement). While these discrete stages may not map directly to computational systems, they highlight important functional requirements for creative AI: the need to acquire and process relevant knowledge, generate novel connections, and critically evaluate outputs.\nMore recent work emphasizes the social and interactive nature of creative processes. Gl\u0103veanu's perspective-taking theory frames creativity as requiring shifts between creator and audience viewpoints, suggesting the importance of incorporating audience preferences and feedback into computational creative systems. This aligns with modern approaches that use human feedback to guide creative AI systems."}, {"title": "2.1.3 Product", "content": "The Product perspective examines what makes outputs worthy of being considered \"creative.\" A dominant framework defines creativity through two fundamental criteria: novelty and value (Boden [2004], Gaut [2010]). Under this definition, a product is considered creative if and only if it satisfies both conditions - being both novel and valuable within its domain.\nNovelty itself has multiple important distinctions. Boden differentiates between P-creativity (psychological creativity - novel to the creator) and H-creativity (historical creativity - novel to human history). This basic distinction was further refined by Kaufman and Beghetto's (Kaufman and Beghetto [2009]) \"Four C's\" model, which hierarchically categorizes creativity into Big-C (historically significant achievements), Pro-C (professional-level contributions), Little-c (everyday creative problem-solving), and Mini-c (personal creative insights). (Bartel [1985]) emphasizes that truly original works must serve as origins - introducing unique attributes that influence subsequent works rather than just being different.\nCurrent work in LLM-based idea generation faces several significant evaluation challenges. Most approaches rely heavily on human evaluation, which can introduce subjective biases and be difficult to standardize across different studies. When automated metrics are used, they typically reduce novelty evaluation to simple semantic similarity measures, failing to capture Boden's deeper notion of meaningful novelty or Bartel's concept of originality as influence. Furthermore, many current approaches focus almost exclusively on novelty while neglecting the crucial value dimension of creativity.\nThe value criterion, while more challenging to formalize, remains essential for genuine creativity. While some argue that value judgments are inherently subjective and culturally dependent (Moneta and Csikszentmihalyi [1996]), others propose that value should be understood in terms of effectiveness or appropriateness to specific goals (Kaufman and Baer [2012]). However, existing approaches often struggle to systematically assess value, either omitting this criterion entirely or relying solely on subjective human judgments. For computational creativity systems, particularly those working with LLMs, these theoretical perspectives and current limitations highlight the need for more objective and reproducible evaluation frameworks that can assess both novelty and value. This motivates consideration of new evaluation approaches that could ground assessment in historical scientific development rather than relying purely on similarity metrics or human judgment."}, {"title": "2.1.4 Press", "content": "The Press perspective considers the broader environmental and cultural context that influences and evaluates creative work. This includes understanding how societal norms, domain conventions, and audience expectations shape both the creative process and the reception of creative products.\nThis theoretical framework has proven particularly valuable for developing computational creativity systems, as it provides structured ways to think about design choices and evaluation criteria. When applied to LLM-based creative systems, these perspectives help identify key considerations: how to structure the system's capabilities (Person), what processes to implement for idea generation (Process), how to evaluate the quality of generated ideas (Product), and how to ensure the system's outputs are valuable within their intended context (Press)."}, {"title": "2.2 Idea generation via large language models", "content": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in computational idea generation, particularly for scientific research. These efforts can be understood through the lens of computational creativity theory, especially Boden's framework of creative processes. Early work in this direction focused on hypothesis generation (Yang et al. [2024a], Qi et al. [2023]), which primarily exemplifies exploratory creativity within the confined conceptual space of binary relationships between scientific concepts. While valuable, this approach operates within highly constrained boundaries and doesn't fully leverage LLMs' potential for more transformative creative processes.\nMore recent approaches have attempted to expand the creative scope by augmenting LLMs with scientific literature. ResearchAgent (Baek et al. [2024]) implements a form of combinatorial creativity by using an entity-centric knowledge store and academic knowledge graphs to help LLMs identify and combine concepts across different papers. This multi-agent framework mirrors the Generation-Evaluation loop described in the Geneplore model, using peer review mechanisms to iteratively refine generated ideas. Similarly, (Wang et al. [2023]) develop methods for identifying novel research opportunities by analyzing conceptual relationships across papers, demonstrating how computational systems can systematically explore and combine ideas from existing literature. Comprehensive research automation systems like AI-Scientist (Lu et al. [2024]) attempt to model the entire creative process, from literature review to idea generation and validation. These approaches align with stage-based creativity theories like Wallas' model, implementing distinct phases for knowledge gathering, idea generation, and verification.\nThe evaluation of LLM-generated ideas presents unique challenges that intersect with the Product perspective of creativity theory. (Si et al. [2024]) conducted comprehensive comparisons between LLM and human-generated ideas, finding that while LLMs can match human experts in novelty, they often struggle with what creativity theorists term \"value\" - the practical utility and feasibility of generated ideas. This aligns with broader observations in computational creativity about the challenge of balancing novelty with usefulness.\nThese existing approaches, while promising, often lack explicit grounding in established creativity theory. Most systems treat idea generation as an information-processing task rather than a creative process that requires systematic exploration and transformation of conceptual spaces. Additionally, current evaluation methods typically focus on practical metrics without considering how these relate to theoretical understandings of creative products. This gap between theory and practice suggests the need for approaches that explicitly incorporate creativity theoretical frameworks into both system design and evaluation."}, {"title": "3 Combinatorial creativity agent framework", "content": "Our framework consists of two main phases: knowledge preparation and combinatorial idea generation, as shown in figure 1. The knowledge preparation phase gathers useful familiar concepts, while the combinatorial process uses these concepts to generate creative ideas."}, {"title": "3.1 Idea Extraction and Retrieval", "content": "Traditional retrieval methods like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and academic graph databases often struggle to effectively connect knowledge across different domains, as they typically focus on surface-level similarity or direct keyword matches. To address this challenge, we developed a generalization-level retrieval system, as shown in Figure 2, which enables effective cross-domain knowledge discovery through multi-level semantic matching.\nAs illustrated in the left part of Figure 2, we introduce a semi-structured \"ideation format\" that captures both concrete details and abstract principles of innovations. This standardized format stores comprehensive metadata including innovation names, original problems, key mechanisms, novel insights, and most importantly, parallel generalization levels (L1-L4). These levels represent a gradient from domain-specific implementations to universal principles, allowing ideas to be matched at various levels of abstraction. Each innovation entry is structured in a consistent JSON format to ensure reliable processing and comparison.\nThe retrieval process, shown in the right part of Figure 2 and Figure 1, operates through a two-stage pipeline. First, when a new problem is presented, our AI agent analyzes it using a structured prompt to extract multiple perspectives and problem structures. Each structure is then mapped across the four generalization levels, mirroring the format of stored innovations. In the second stage, we utilize OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model for high-quality semantic embeddings. The process flows from problem-level embedding through a similarity filter to idea-level embedding. For each problem structure at each generalization level, we compute cosine similarities with all stored innovations and select the most similar innovation based on ranking scores. This approach ensures we capture the most relevant analogous solution at each abstraction level.\nThis multi-level matching approach offers several key advantages. By considering similarities at different abstraction levels, the system can identify non-obvious connections between problems and potential solutions from disparate domains. The preservation of implementation details alongside abstract principles ensures that identified solutions remain practically applicable rather than purely theoretical. Moreover, the structured format maintains clear traceability between abstract concepts and concrete implementations, facilitating effective knowledge transfer across domains.\nThrough this comprehensive approach, our system enables the discovery of innovative solutions that might be overlooked by traditional retrieval methods, while ensuring that the identified connections are both meaningful and actionable for practical problem-solving."}, {"title": "3.2 Combinatorial Process", "content": "After retrieving relevant innovations through our multi-level matching system, we implement a two-stage combinatorial process that specifically emphasizes combinatorial creativity - the ability to merge existing ideas and concepts in novel ways to generate innovative solutions. This process systematically explores potential combinations of existing innovations while maintaining their practical applicability.\nThe first stage implements parallel processing across different generalization levels to maximize the potential for novel combinations. For each generalization level, relevant innovations are batched together and analyzed by an AI agent specializing in combinational creativity. The agent examines each innovation through three key perspectives: (1) Component Analysis - breaking down innovations into fundamental mechanisms and principles that could be recombined, (2) Cross-domain Application - identifying how components could be adapted or reinterpreted in new contexts, and (3) Building Block Assessment - evaluating whether components can serve as foundations for new solutions. This structured decomposition is crucial for combinatorial creativity as it creates a rich pool of elements that can be recombined in novel ways."}, {"title": "4 Experiments", "content": ""}, {"title": "4.1 Quantitative Evaluation", "content": "To evaluate our framework's effectiveness in generating innovative ideas through combinatorial creativity, we conducted experiments using the OAG-Bench dataset(Zhang et al. [2024]). This dataset provides an ideal testing ground as it contains papers along with their important references, allowing us to assess how well our system can generate ideas that align with actual research developments. Since most of these papers were peer-reviewed and published in reputable venues, they inherently satisfy both the novelty and value criteria of creative products - their publication indicates they made original contributions to their fields (novelty) and were deemed scientifically sound and useful by expert reviewers (value). By comparing our generated ideas with these validated research developments, we can evaluate not just similarity, but implicitly assess whether our framework can produce ideas that meet both key criteria for creativity."}, {"title": "4.1.1 Experimental Setup", "content": "We selected 87 papers from OAG-Bench, each with 3-5 important references identified in their citation network based on citation impact and content relevance. Our evaluation strategy involves using these references as the knowledge base to generate innovative ideas, and then comparing them with the actual innovations presented in the main papers. For each paper, we use our idea extractor agent to extract the core problem statement, which serves as input to our framework. The knowledge base consists of the important references for each paper, structured according to our ideation format. We use Claude-3.5-Sonnet-20241022 as the LLM backend for all idea generation and analysis tasks."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Baseline and Metrics", "content": "We implemented a baseline system that directly generates ideas given a problem statement, without our multi-level retrieval and combinatorial process. Both our framework and the baseline produce structured outputs in JSON format containing key fields: problem structure, design rationale, universal principle, and key mechanism.\nTo assess the quality of generated ideas, we compute semantic similarity scores between each field of the generated ideas and the corresponding sections in the target papers. We use allenai-specter model(Cohan et al. [2020]) to generate embeddings and calculate cosine similarity for each field: Problem Structure Similarity (PS-Sim), Design Rationale Similarity (DR-Sim), Universal Principle Similarity (UP-Sim), Key Mechanism Similarity (KM-Sim)."}, {"title": "4.1.3 Results", "content": "Our framework demonstrates consistent superior performance over the baseline across all similarity metrics. As shown in Figure 3, we visualize the comparison results from multiple perspectives.\nThe scatter plot (leftmost) compares the overall average similarities between our method and the baseline, with most points lying above the equality line, indicating systematic improvement. The bar chart shows the average field similarities, where our method achieves higher scores across all three key metrics: DR-Sim (0.85 vs 0.78), UP-Sim (0.83 vs 0.75), and KM-Sim (0.87 vs 0.77).\nThe three line plots provide a detailed paper-by-paper comparison for each metric. In design rationale similarity, our method maintains more stable performance with similarity scores consistently above 0.8, while the baseline shows higher variance, occasionally dropping below 0.7. For universal principle similarity, our approach demonstrates particularly strong advantages in maintaining high similarity (mostly above 0.8) compared to the baseline's fluctuating performance. The key mechanism similarity comparison shows the most significant improvement, with our method achieving consistently higher scores around 0.85-0.95 while the baseline frequently drops to 0.7-0.8. These results strongly suggest that Large Language Models are capable of effective combinatorial creativity, successfully combining and adapting existing ideas to generate novel solutions that align well with real research developments."}, {"title": "4.2 Qualitative Evaluation", "content": "To better understand how our framework generates ideas compared to actual research developments, we conducted a detailed qualitative analysis of the solutions. We present a comparative analysis of three representative cases in Table 1, with the test and target samples provided in Appendix A."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing combinatorial creativity using Large Language Models, specifically designed to facilitate combinatorial creativity for idea generation.The experimental results on the OAG-Bench dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baseline approaches in generating ideas that align with real research developments. Particularly strong performance in key mechanism and design rationale similarities suggests that our approach successfully captures both technical depth and logical coherence in the generated ideas. These results indicate that LLMs, when guided by appropriate frameworks, can effectively support combinatorial creativity in research and innovation.\nLooking forward, this work opens several promising directions for future research, particularly in deeper integration with computational creativity theory. Following Boden's theoretical framework, our work on combinatorial creativity could be extended to realize exploratory creativity by developing mechanisms for systematically searching conceptual spaces, and transformative creativity by enabling the modification of these spaces' constraints. From the Process perspective, the framework could be enhanced to support different creative reasoning patterns such as analogical thinking and conceptual blending, while incorporating real-time feedback mechanisms to enable more dynamic creative processes.\nFrom the Product perspective, there is a crucial need to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can assess different types of creativity. While our current evaluation focuses on alignment with existing research developments, future work should develop metrics that can differentiate between P-creativity (ideas novel to the system) and H-creativity (historically novel ideas), as well as assess different levels of creative achievement following Kaufman and Beghetto's \"Four C's\" model. Additionally, developing benchmarks that can evaluate not just novelty and value, but also influence potential and domain-specific impact measures would significantly advance our understanding of machine creativity.\nFurthermore, the framework could be extended to handle more diverse types of knowledge sources and adapt to specific domain requirements, all while maintaining theoretical grounding in established creativity models. We believe our framework provides a solid foundation for developing more sophisticated tools that bridge computational creativity theory with practical AI-assisted innovation."}]}

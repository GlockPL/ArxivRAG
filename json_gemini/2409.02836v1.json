We introduce a novel classification scheme named \"Prediction statements,\" categorizing comments into Predictive Incremental, Predictive Decremental, Predictive Neutral, or Non-Predictive categories. Employing GPT-40, a cutting-edge large language model, we explore sentiment dynamics across five prominent cryptocurrencies: Cardano, Binance, Matic, Fantom, and Ripple. Our analysis reveals distinct patterns in predictive sentiments, with Matic demonstrating a notably higher propensity for optimistic predictions. Additionally, we investigate hope and regret sentiments, uncovering nuanced interplay between these emotions and predictive behaviors. Despite encountering limitations related to data volume and resource availability, our study reports valuable discoveries concerning investor behavior and sentiment trends within the cryptocurrency market, informing strategic decision-making and future research endeavors.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "A prediction is an assertion about future events based on current data, trends, or information. It involves leveraging historical data, identifying patterns, and using models to forecast future outcomes. Predictions are common in many fields, including weather forecasting, finance, sports, science, health, and beyond.\nIn 2008, an individual known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a seminal paper titled 'Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,' marking a pivotal moment in financial history. This innovation succeeded where many others had failed, introducing Bitcoin as a decentralized electronic cash system, now universally known as cryptocurrency. As time progressed, numerous other cryptocurrencies emerged, capturing the interest of a diverse audience. Some individuals viewed these digital assets as investment opportunities, others used them for financial transactions, and many engaged in trading [1, 2]. Similar to our study, various research efforts have employed sentiment analysis to predict cryptocurrency prices, using data sources such as news [3, 4], tweets [5, 6], and other related datasets.\nThe advancement of pre-training techniques has empowered large language models (LLMs) to master natural language processing (NLP) tasks with only a few examples provided \"in context,\" eliminating the need to modify the model's parameters [7]. Few-shot learning, the capability to learn from a small number of examples, is a fundamental aspect of artificial intelligence [8].\nIn this study, we aim to identify predictive statements within cryptocurrency investment tweet data. We utilize a structured approach to classify these tweet segments into four categories: Predictive Incremental, Predictive Decremental, Predictive Neutral, or Non-Predictive, by leveraging the capabilities of GPT-40. Additionally, we utilized two existing tasks, namely, hope speech detection and regret detection, to calculate the percentage of hope and regret expressed in these cryptocurrencies tweets.\nOur comprehensive research explores the motivations and emotions of cryptocurrency investors. We analyze levels of hope, regret, and the prediction of cryptocurrency performance among users discussing digital currencies on X platform. For this purpose, we selected 1,000 tweets each for five cryptocurrencies-Cardano, Binance, Fantom, Matic, and Ripple-resulting in a dataset of 5,000 tweets. We employed few-shot learning with GPT-40, the latest advanced model, to detect labels for these tweets. GPT-40, with \"o\" standing for \"omni,\" is a multimodal model capable of processing both text and image inputs and generating text outputs. It maintains the high intelligence of GPT-4 Turbo but operates more efficiently, producing text at twice the speed and half the cost.\nFurthermore, we further explored the aspect of \"reasons and significance.\" In simpler terms, our objective was to determine which cryptocurrency holds more promise, which carries more regret, which exhibits incremental predictability, and which demonstrates decremental pre-dictability compared to other cryptocurrencies. To accomplish this, we examined the following contributions:\nA new model is introduced that provides predictive statements along with their categorization.\nEach comment is labeled according to its task: Predictive statement, Hope speech detection, or Regret detection.\nThe percentage of hope, regret, and predictions for each coin is demonstrated.\nVarious themes of hopes and regrets associated with each coin are identified."}, {"title": "2. Definitions", "content": ""}, {"title": "2.1. Predictive Statement", "content": "In this task, a prediction refers to a statement about the future performance or trend of an investment or market within tweets. We categorize these predictions as incremental (indicating expected improvement), decremental (indicating expected decline), or neutral (indicating no significant change). Our goal is to analyze investment-related tweets to determine which category\u2014incremental, decremental, or neutral\u2014has the highest percentage of predictions.\nIncremental predictions refer to forecasts that indicate a positive trend or enhancement in a future event or outcome. These predictions suggest that there will be growth, improvement, or an upward shift in the situation being analyzed. For instance, in business, an incremental prediction might forecast a rise in sales or an increase in market share.\nDecremental predictions pertain to forecasts that signal a negative trend or decline in a future event or outcome. These predictions indicate a reduction, deterioration, or downward movement in the scenario under consideration. For example, in economics, a decremental prediction could suggest a drop in GDP or a decline in employment rates.\nNeutral predictions describe forecasts that predict no significant change in a future event or outcome. These predictions suggest stability or stasis, where the current conditions are expected to remain relatively unchanged. In environmental studies, a neutral prediction might imply that current pollution levels will stay constant over a given period.\nNon-predictive text segments are those that do not contain any forecasts or projections about future events or outcomes. These segments may provide descriptions, explanations, or analyses that are focused on past or present conditions without making any statements about what might happen in the future."}, {"title": "2.2. Hope Detection", "content": "Hope is a remarkable human ability that allows individuals to imagine future possibilities and their potential outcomes. These visions strongly influence emotions, actions, and mindset, despite the possibility of the desired outcome being improbable. [9, 10] In this research, we analyze various categories of hope within our data, including:\nGeneralized Hope within the realm of cryptocurrency data embodies a pervasive sense of optimism and hopefulness that permeates the landscape. This sentiment isn't tied to any specific event or outcome but rather signifies a positive outlook on the overall dynamics, developments, and future possibilities in the cryptocurrency domain. This encompassing hope extends to anticipating price increases or decreases, aiming to lever-age these fluctuations for more favorable investment opportunities, influencing one's optimistic stance within the cryptocurrency sphere [11, 12, 13, 14].\nIn the domain of cryptocurrency,\nNot Hope refers to the absence of any inclination toward hope, wishful thinking, desire for specific outcomes, or future-oriented expectations within the context of the discussed cryptocurrency-related content. Such tweet exhibits no indicators of positive anticipation, desired outcomes, or forward-looking expectations in this domain.\nIn the cryptocurrency realm,\nRealistic Hope involves envisioning outcomes that are reasonable, meaningful, and within the realms of possibility. This hopeful perspective encompasses expectations for sensible and likely results, often tethered to regular and expected events or developments within the cryptocurrency space. Notably, when Bitcoin, as a leader in cryptocurrencies, experiences an increase, it often sparks hope among traders for a positive transforma-tion within the broader cryptomarket, influencing their realistic hopes for favorable changes [15, 16, 14].\nUnrealistic Hope within the cryptocurrency domain, represents an infrequent occur-rence that occasionally emerges. It typically involves a desire for improbable events or outcomes to materialize, despite their extremely low or non-existent likelihood. This form of hope might arise from emotional states like anger, sadness, or depression, compelling individuals to anticipate unrealistic events or outcomes. For instance, an individual might fervently believe that purchasing a particular coin will instantly transform them into a wealthy individual, even when the likelihood of such an outcome is highly improba-ble. This hope lacks rational grounding and a meaningful basis within the context of cryptocurrencies [17, 18, 19]."}, {"title": "2.3. Regret Detection", "content": "Regret [20]emerges as a negative feeling in reaction to situations or events that individual desires had unfolded in an alternative manner [21]. Frequently, it's linked with sentiments of remorse, disillusionment, and self-criticism [22, 23]. This particular task aims to categorize texts into three distinct groups: 'Regret due to taking action' (Action), 'Regret due to not taking action' (Inaction), and 'No expressed regret'.\nRegret by Action\nIn the cryptocurrency domain, \"Regret by Action\" encompasses the feeling of remorse triggered by a past action, such as buying a particular coin, that leads to unfavorable outcomes, notably, a decrease in its value. This form of regret surfaces when a decision or action results in undesired consequences, specifically within the context of cryptocurrency investments, impacting an individual's financial holdings or expectations.\nRegret by Inaction\nIn the realm of cryptocurrency, \"Regret by Inaction\" materializes when an individual refrains from taking a specific action, such as buying a coin, and later experiences remorse due to the subsequent increase in its value. This type of regret stems from the decision to not act, leading to a sense of regret or missed opportunity caused by the favorable outcomes that follow the action not taken within the cryptocurrency domain.\nNo Regret\nThe text does not express any form of regret."}, {"title": "3. Literature Review", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1. Cryptocurrency", "content": "Huang et al. [24] focus on forecasting cryptocurrency price volatility by assessing social media sentiment and establishing correlations. Utilizing the prominent Chinese platform Sina-Weibo, a comprehensive corpus was gathered, comprising 24,000 tweets and 70,000 associated comments related to Bitcoin, ETH, or XPR over an eight-day span. A specialized sentiment dictionary was formulated, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network, combined with historical cryptocurrency price data, was proposed to predict future price trends. Com-parative experiments showcased the proposed method's superiority, the precision and recall of the Auto Regression model were 73.4% and 80.2%, respectively, while the LSTM Sentiment Analyzer achieved 87.0% precision and 92.5% recall.\nNasekin and Chen [25] examine the market sentiment among cryptocurrency investors and traders using the StockTwits platform. Employing machine learning techniques, specifically, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), sentiment indices are constructed to capture the evolving opinions of the cryptocurrency community regarding the market over time. These newly created sentiment indices are then integrated into predictive models for the autoregressive mean and variance of returns in the CRIX cryptocurrency index. Analysis reveals that the RNN LSTM configuration, coupled with a pre-trained embedding layer, demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to other RNN setups using GRU or LSTM units, either with pre-trained or randomly initiated embeddings. The study utilizes a unique dataset comprising 1.22 million messages associated with 425 cryptocurrencies, sourced from the microblogging platform StockTwits\u00b9, covering the period from March 2013 to May 2018.\nShahiki Tash et al. [26] contribute a comprehensive analysis of English tweets associated with cryptocurrencies, focusing on a curated dataset encompassing nine digital coins. Leveraging tools like LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) [27], Emotion 2, Sentiment [28], and Readability [29, 30, 31, 32] analysis, the study scrutinizes linguistic attributes and sentiment trends within these tweets. Notably, the examination reveals distinct linguistic traits across var-ious cryptocurrencies, with a prevailing tendency towards logical and formal thought in tweets. Fantom coin emerges as prominently characterized by these features, showcasing discussions leaning towards logical and formal thinking in comparison to other coins. Moreover, the study highlights differential sentiment scores among cryptocurrencies, notably observing Fantom coin generating higher positive sentiment while Ripple coin exhibits elevated negative sentiment. Emotionally, most cryptocurrencies display a balanced profile, emphasizing \"Anticipation,\""}, {"title": "3.2. Hope and Regret Detection", "content": "Prior research efforts aimed at tackling hate Shahiki-Tash et al. [41] in English, disregarding the wider scope of harmful content across languages. To bridge this gap, a fresh Hope Speech dataset for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (HopeEDI) Chakravarthi [42] was compiled, featuring user comments from YouTube in English, Tamil, and Malayalam. This dataset, totaling 28,451, 20,198, and 10,705 comments respectively, underwent meticulous annotation for hope speech detection. In evaluating dataset reliability, Krippendorff's alpha Krippendorff [43] was used for inter-annotator agreement. Notably, the SVM classifier demonstrated the lowest macro-average F1-scores within the HopeEDI dataset, while differing model performances were observed. Decision trees performed better in English and Malayalam, while logistic regression excelled in the Tamil subset.\nBalouchzahi et al. [44], present a fresh dataset for categorizing tweets as \"Hope\" or \"Not Hope,\" further classifying them into \"Generalized Hope,\" \"Realistic Hope,\" and \"Unrealistic Hope.\" Derived from English tweets from the first half of 2022, the dataset was collected using Tweepy's API, filtering tweets on various parameters, focusing on domains such as women's child abortion rights, black people's rights, religion, and politics. The collection involved approximately 100,000 tweets, from which a randomly chosen subset of 10,000 tweets was used for further analysis. Notable F1-scores were observed in model performance: LR achieved 0.80 in binary hope speech detection, CatBoost scored 0.54 in multiclass hope speech detection, BiLSTM attained 0.79 for binary hope speech detection and 0.57 for multiclass detection, and bert-base-uncased showed promising F1-scores of 0.85 for binary hope speech detection and 0.72 for multiclass hope speech detection, marking the best performance outcomes."}, {"title": "4.

This method is specifically tailored for analyzing comments pertaining to cryptocurrencies, with a primary focus on identifying predictive statements. Additionally, we incorporated two pre-existing tasks: expressions of regret and hope speech. Following this, we embarked on classifying data associated with these tasks. Leveraging few-shot learning, the GPT-40 model underwent training using labeled examples to achieve precise comment classification. Regret detection entailed labeling comments with RegretType, making distinctions between Regret by Action, Regret by Inaction, and No Regret, also employing few-shot learning. Likewise, hope speech detection involved categorizing comments into Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, Unrealistic Hope, or Not Hope, utilizing the same few-shot learning method.

Data Preprocessing", "content": "After acquiring the dataset, we initiated a multi-step data preprocessing protocol aimed at refining and optimizing the data. This process comprised the following primary stages:\nURL Removal: Employing a regular expression pattern, we systematically identified and eliminated any URLs present within the dataset.\nText Cleaning: This phase involved the systematic removal of special characters, such as punctuation marks, leveraging a dedicated dictionary of such characters. Additionally, words with a length equal to or less than two characters were excluded. The outcome was a refined version of the textual data devoid of unnecessary elements.\nFor each comment, we implemented preprocessing procedures to ensure its compatibility for subsequent analysis, encompassing:\nElimination of superfluous characters or noise.\nTokenization of comments to facilitate improved handling by the model.\nNormalization of text to ensure uniformity and consistency throughout the dataset."}, {"title": "4.4.

Results and Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "5.1. Prediction", "content": "Examining the data, it's notable that each cryptocurrency has a significant portion of predictive tweets, with varying degrees of incremental and decremental predictions.\nAmong the predictive categories, Cardano's tweets are fairly evenly distributed between incremental (2.2%) and decremental (2.3%) predictions, suggesting a balanced sentiment regard-ing its future performance. However, the proportion of neutral predictions is minimal (0.1%), indicating a lack of consensus on its future trajectory.\nSimilar to Cardano, Binance also has a relatively balanced distribution of predictive tweets, with a slightly higher percentage of decremental predictions (4.5%) compared to incremental predictions (4.4%). Again, neutral predictions are minimal (0.2%), indicating a clear directional sentiment among users discussing Binance.\nMatic stands out with a notably higher percentage of incremental predictions (8.1%) compared to decremental predictions (2.4%). This suggests a more optimistic sentiment among users discussing Matic, anticipating growth or improvement in its future performance. However, similar to other coins, neutral predictions remain minimal (0.3%).\nFantom's predictive tweets also show a balanced distribution between incremental (3.6%) and decremental (1.9%) predictions, albeit with a slightly higher emphasis on incremental predictions. As with other coins, neutral predictions are very rare (0.1%).\nRipple's predictive tweets are somewhat evenly distributed between incremental (3.7%) and decremental (4.3%) predictions, indicating a mixed sentiment regarding its future performance. Again, neutral predictions are minimal (0.4%), reflecting a clear directional sentiment among users discussing Ripple. Further details can be found in Table 3.\nIn summary, while there's a mix of sentiment expressed in predictive tweets across all cryptocurrencies, Matic stands out with a notably higher proportion of incremental predictions, suggesting a more positive outlook compared to other coins. The summary of the distribution in Figure 1 is as follows:"}, {"title": "5.2. Hope Detection", "content": "The analysis of sentiment distribution across various cryptocurrencies reveals intriguing patterns in how users perceive and express sentiments about each digital asset. Fantom emerges as the cryptocurrency garnering the highest percentage of tweets categorized as \"Not-Hope,\" indicative of a prevalent sentiment of skepticism or negativity surrounding this particular asset. Conversely, Matic exhibits a significant surge in tweets categorized as \"Unrealistic Hope,\" suggesting an abundance of optimism or unrealistic expectations associated with this cryptocurrency. These divergent sentiment distributions underscore the nuanced nature of sentiment dynamics within the cryptocurrency space, where each asset engenders a unique sentiment landscape shaped by factors such as market performance, technological advancements, and community sentiment.\nFurthermore, the varying degrees of \"Generalized Hope\" and \"Realistic Hope\" across dif-ferent cryptocurrencies highlight the multifaceted nature of sentiment expression within the cryptocommunity. While some assets like Binance may evoke more realistic expectations or generalized optimism, others like Ripple may witness a higher prevalence of unrealistic expec-tations or speculative fervor.

Discussion", "content": "Analyzing both hope, regret, and predictive sentiments in cryptocurrency-related discussions can yield profound insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. The data suggests that predictive sentiments, such as \"Predictive Incremental\" or \"Predictive Decremental,\" significantly influence the overall emotional landscape. For instance, a higher prevalence of \"Predictive Incremental\" tweets may reflect investor optimism about future price movements, potentially correlating with elevated levels of hope and diminished regret. Conversely, an abundance of \"Predictive Decremental\" tweets may indicate a more cautious outlook, potentially aligning with heightened regret and reduced hope. Understanding these predictive sentiments alongside hope and regret provides a holistic view of investor behavior and sentiment trends in the cryptocurrency market, empowering stakeholders to make more informed decisions regarding investment strategies and risk management.\nFurthermore, exploring the relationship between hope and regret uncovers an intriguing inverse correlation. Higher instances of \"Unrealistic Hope\" tweets may coincide with lower occurrences of \"Regret by Action\" or \"Regret by Inaction,\" suggesting that exaggerated optimism could mitigate feelings of regret among investors. Conversely, a preponderance of \"Regret by Action\" or \"Regret by Inaction\" tweets may dampen sentiments of hope, as regretful reflections on past decisions overshadow optimistic outlooks for the future. This dynamic underscores the nuanced interplay between emotions in shaping investor perceptions and decision-making processes within the cryptocurrency market.\nIn conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of hope, regret, and predictive sentiments provides invaluable insights into investor behavior and sentiment trends in the cryptocurrency domain. By understanding the intricate dynamics between these emotions, stakeholders can navigate market fluctuations more effectively and strategically position themselves for success. This nuanced understanding enhances the ability to interpret sentiment trends accurately and make data-driven decisions, ultimately maximizing opportunities and mitigating risks in the cryptocurrency market."}, {"title": "7. Conclusion and Future Work", "content": "In this study, we examined five prominent cryptocurrencies, namely Cardano, Binance, Matic, Fantom, and Ripple, comprising a total dataset of 5,000 comments, with each cryptocurrency represented by 1,000 comments. Introducing a novel classification scheme named \"Prediction,\" we categorized comments into four distinct categories: Predictive Incremental, Predictive Decre-mental, Predictive Neutral, or Non-Predictive. Leveraging GPT-40, we performed classification tasks, observing a notable trend in the Matic coin, where users exhibited a higher propensity for prediction, particularly in the Predictive Incremental category, indicating a more favorable senti-ment towards investment in this coin. Conversely, Cardano demonstrated the lowest percentage of prediction, suggesting comparatively lower enthusiasm for investment. Notably, Binance displayed a higher percentage of Predictive Decremental sentiment, suggesting a prevailing negative outlook toward investment in this particular cryptocurrency. Subsequent to prediction analysis, we pursued two ancillary tasks: hope speech detection and regret detection. Within the hope category, Matic exhibited the highest proportion of hope sentiments, predominantly characterized by Unrealistic Hope, while also demonstrating the highest percentage of Realistic Hope. Conversely, Cardano displayed the highest proportion of General Hope sentiments, implying a more optimistic outlook regarding future investment prospects in Matic. As a matter of fact, we encountered challenges in conducting a detailed regret analysis due to the notably low occurrence of regret-labeled comments. For future research, we intend to expand the dataset size and assess the correlation between cryptocurrency price fluctuations and sentiment analysis outcomes at the data collection juncture. Additionally, we aim to ascertain the accuracy percentage of GPT-40 predictions, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of our analysis."}, {"title": "8.

{"title": "Benchmarking Time Series Forecasting Models: From Statistical Techniques to Foundation Models in Real-World Applications", "authors": ["Issar Arab", "Rodrigo Benitez"], "abstract": "Time series forecasting is essential for operational intelligence in the hospitality industry, and particularly challenging in large-scale, distributed systems. This study evaluates the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), deep learning, and foundation models in forecasting hourly sales over a 14-day horizon using real-world data from a network of thousands of restaurants across Germany. The forecasting solution includes features such as weather conditions, calendar events, and time-of-day patterns. Results demonstrate the strong performance of ML-based meta-models and highlight the emerging potential of foundation models like Chronos and TimesFM, which deliver competitive performance with minimal feature engineering, leveraging only the pre-trained model (zero-shot inference). Additionally, a hybrid PySpark-Pandas approach proves to be a robust solution for achieving horizontal scalability in large-scale deployments.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "AI and machine learning have shown remarkable potential in solving complex problems across diverse domains. They have revolutionized fields such as natural language processing [1], protein sequence analysis [2][3][4], mass spectrometry proteomics [5], drug discovery [6][7][8], software testing and fault localization [9], and the wide field of time series [10]. Time series forecasting has evolved significantly, moving from classical statistical approaches like ARIMA [11] to advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques [12] such as RNNs, LSTMs [13], and transformers [14][15]. Recent advancements in foundation models introduce promising avenues for multivariate and univariate time series forecasting with minimal feature engineering.\nThis study addresses the challenge of forecasting hourly sales for thousands of restaurants across Germany over the next 14 days. Using 2 years historical sales data, weather, and location-specific calendar features, the objective is to optimize staffing and procurement decisions based on the future sales volume on hourly basis in a restaurant. Using a sample of 4 restaurants located in different regions in the country, we benchmarked statistical, ML-based, conventional deep learning, and foundation models, analyzing their performance, scalability, and practicality for real-world deployment for large-scale production."}, {"title": "II.

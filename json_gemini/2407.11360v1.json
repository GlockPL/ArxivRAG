By maintaining the flexibility to\nincorporate ongoing literature and emerging insights, the methodology ensures that the research remains\nat the forefront of discussions on AI. The review was initiated with the search of studies related to the\nkey research questions. The literature search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed,\nGoogle Scholar, and IEEE Xplore, augmented by recent articles from credible news websites and blogs from\nauthoritative organizations like Google. Keywords such as 'Generative AI risks', 'AI ethics', 'human-AI\ninteraction', 'risk mitigation', 'ethical AI', 'AI governance', 'AI regulations', and 'ethical AI frameworks'\nwere employed to ensure a thorough exploration of the subject.\nSimultaneously, a search on the above-mentioned databases was carried out to find relevant literature on the\necological interactions between giraffes and acacia.

Drawing from philosopher Daniel\nDennett's perspective [19], who emphasized analogies as 'tools for thinking,' we employ the giraffe and\nacacia tree analogy to explore the dynamic interactions between Generative AI (Gen AI) and humans.\n\"Analogies do not reveal the entire truth but offer just enough to let us grasp its essence.\"\n3.1 Giraffe and Acacia: Risks and Reciprocal Adaptations\nImagine the African Savannah, where towering adult giraffes engage in a\ndaily strategic battle for survival with resilient acacia trees. Each giraffe\nconsumes a staggering 34 kilograms of foliage daily, challenging the acacia,\nwhich serves as their primary source of nutrient-rich, protein-packed, and\nhydrating forage [20, 21]. In defence, the acacia employs a comprehensive\narsenal: paired, stout, sharp, four-inch-long thorns; deterrent chemicals\nlike tannin and cyanide (prussic acid) that render the leaves less appealing\nand more resistant to digestion; fiercely protective ants that bite and inject\npoison into the wounds, hidden within swollen thorns; and the tree's own\narchitecture and considerable height to inhibit excessive foraging [22-25]. brows an acacia tree.\nThe pace of future progress in general-purpose AI capabilities has sub-\nstantial implications for managing emerging risks, but experts disagree on what to expect even in the near\nfuture. Experts variously support the possibility of general-purpose AI capabilities advancing slowly, rapidly,\nor extremely rapidly. This disagreement involves a key question: will continued 'scaling' of resources and\nrefining existing techniques be sufficient to yield rapid progress and solve issues such as reliability and factual\naccuracy, or are new research breakthroughs required to substantially advance general-purpose AI abilities?\nSeveral leading companies that develop general-purpose AI are betting on 'scaling' to continue leading to\nperformance improvements. If recent trends continue, by the end of 2026 some general-purpose AI models\nwill be trained using 40x to 100x more compute than the most compute-intensive models published in 2023,\ncombined with training methods that use this compute 3x to 20x more efficiently. However, there are po-\ntential bottlenecks to further increasing both data and compute, including the availability of data, AI chips,\ncapital expenditure, and local energy capacity. Companies developing general-purpose AI are working to\nnavigate these potential bottlenecks.\nGiraffes have evolved unique adaptations to handle these defences, including a mouth designed for selective\nbiting with tough, dexterous lips; an extraordinarily long, resilient, and prehensile 20-inch tongue; and split\nnostrils that can close to prevent ant attacks. Though certain thorns may offer some deterrence, at least\nto adolescent giraffes, mature giraffes with remarkable resilience, are known to ingest and consume both\ntender shoots and hardened thorns with apparent indifference [22, 24]. Furthermore, their saliva with its\nantiseptic properties, can help in swallowing the leaves and in neutralising the effects of consumed tannin by\nsalivating, effectively washing these compounds out of their mouths when their impact gets overwhelming.\nThese evolutionary traits enable giraffes to adeptly handle the acacia's defences, allowing for efficient and\nstrategic foraging."}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "fully dominate the acacia and its defences as there are certain aspects like acacia structure and shaped\narchitecture which take them out of their reach and low nutrition quality leaves are something giraffes have\nlimited counter strategies for.\n3.2 Giraffes and Acacia: Mutual Benefits and Reciprocal Shaping\nThe symbiotic relationship between giraffes and acacias is a vivid demonstration of mutual benefit and\nreciprocal shaping. David Attenborough poetically captures the essence of their interaction:\n\"The tree shapes the giraffe and the giraffe shapes the tree.\"\nUtilizing their remarkable height and the unique adaptability of their 20-inch tongues, giraffes expertly nav-\nigate acacia defences to access vital nourishment. This continual interaction not only shapes the distinctive\numbrella-like canopy of the trees but also ensures giraffes maintain a lean, muscular structure optimized\nfor reaching high foliage. Such physical exertions, essential for survival, spur the evolution of both species.\nWhile giraffes develop bodies finely tuned for acacia defences, the trees evolve robust mechanisms to cope\nwith browsing yet thrive from the pruning that bolsters their growth and aids seed dispersal [41]. This\ninterplay is emblematic of a deeper ecological connection, illustrating how two species, through reciprocal\ninfluence, shape each other's existence and contribute to the sustainability of their ecosystem.\nShifting our focus from the natural symbiosis between giraffes and acacias, we examine the complex rela-\ntionship between humans and generative AI. Similar to the mutual influence and evolutionary adaptation\nobserved in nature, the interplay between humans and advanced AI systems presents a dynamic mix of\nsubstantial benefits and significant risks. Next, we explore how generative AI is reshaping human activities\nacross various sectors and discuss the critical challenges that arise as these powerful tools become increasingly\nintegrated into human society."}, {"title": "4 Generative AI and Humans: Risks and Mitigation", "content": "Generative AI is significantly benefiting humans across a variety of sectors, demonstrating its versatility\nand impact.

Furthermore, LLMs can produce harmful responses when manipulated\nby adversarial prompts and may autonomously generate untruthful, toxic, biased, or even illegal content."}, {"title": "4.1 Risks Posed by Gen AI to Humans", "content": "Generative AI poses significant risks across various domains, impacting human society in profound ways.\nThese concerns can be grouped into distinct risk areas, each emphasizing specific challenges that require\nthoughtful consideration and management.\nDisinformation, Hallucinations, and Nefarious Applications AI systems are capable of generating misleading\ninformation or being exploited for harmful purposes. These technologies are trained on uncurated data\nfrom the real world (Wikipedia, books, blog posts, the internet, videos), can craft spread disinformation\nand hallucinations at scale, deceiving individuals and eroding societal trust [9, 42-47]. Existing rewards\nmodels to align the system output with human values that are designed to assess the appropriateness of\nAI-generated content can also be manipulated or bypassed, enabling the propagation of harmful content\n(including disinformation and hallucination), fake news and toxic language [5, 48-50].\nSocial Injustice and Bias Social Injustice and Bias: Generative AI frequently amplifies existing biases found in\ntraining data, leading to discriminatory outcomes that disproportionately affect minorities and marginalized\ncommunities. This reinforcement of prejudice can deepen societal inequalities and exacerbate the digital\ndivide, where access to AI technologies and their benefits is unevenly distributed. Gen AI's propensity to\nperpetuate harmful ideologies through biased outputs. These risks highlight the broader societal impacts,\nincluding the perpetuation of a digital divide and access inequalities, challenging the principles of equity and\nfairness within society [43, 44, 51-55].\nSafety and Security Sophisticated AI systems like advanced AI assistants, present sharply defined safety,\nsecurity, and privacy risks throughout their lifecycle. From the outset, data collection is vulnerable to\nthreats such as data poisoning, which can compromise model integrity from the very beginning. As these\nmodels are trained, they face additional risks like model poisoning, where adversaries introduce harmful\ninputs to manipulate outcomes, potentially leading to severe real-world consequences such as physical harm\nor psychological damage [10, 12, 56-58]. Deployment stages introduce further complexities as these systems\ninteract with the environment, heightening the risk of adversarial manipulations and privacy breaches that\ncould expose sensitive user information. These interactions can lead to substantial security vulnerabilities,\nsuch as invasive data collection and privacy breaches, magnifying the challenges of maintaining data integrity\nand protecting intellectual property rights [10, 12,55-60].\nEthical Concerns and Human-Computer Interaction Harms Users can attribute human-like characteristics\nto gen AI-based Conversational Agents (CA), leading to over-reliance and unsafe use, as well as misplaced\naccountability. Human-like interactions prompt users to reveal personal information more freely, which can\nbe exploited for intrusive recommendations. Additionally, CAs can exploit cognitive biases, deceiving users\nto achieve objectives, even when users know the CAs are artificial [5, 42, 43]. Generative AI can amplify\nharmful behaviours or ideologies, leading to potential self-harm or psychological distress and friction in the\npeaceful organization of social life and human relationships [5,61,62]. Privacy risks are pronounced, with AI\npotentially manipulating users into divulging sensitive data, thus facilitating identity theft or discrimination,\nespecially against marginalized groups. Moreover, AI raises concerns over surveillance and the broader\nimplications of AI decision-making, which can infringe on privacy and autonomy, necessitating stringent\nethical scrutiny and regulatory measures to mitigate these risks.

These areas are expanded upon with their respective mitigation strategies\nin the next section.\nNow let us look at how modern technologists, policymakers, and ethicists are actively developing sophisti-\ncated strategies to manage the risks associated with Generative AI, continuing our tradition of transforming\ntechnological challenges into opportunities for societal advancement.\n4.2 Human Defenses to Mitigate Risks of Gen AI\n4.2.1 Proactive Human Defenses (Type-1)\nAs with every major technological advancement, Generative AI introduces a unique set of challenges. His-\ntorically, human societies have demonstrated a remarkable capacity to adapt and effectively mitigate risks of\nthe tools and technologies they produce. Similarly, humans are trying to deal with the challenges of its more\nrecent and perhaps the most sophisticated technology yet. Given its complexity, opacity and the emergent\nnature of its capabilities, they are learning to deal with the challenges of Generative AI.\nDisinformation, Hallucinations and nefarious applications: Tackling AI-generated information\nhazards involves not only enhancing technical measures like data quality and fine-tuning to reduce disinfor-\nmation but also boosting transparency and educating users about AI's capabilities and limitations. Humans\nare defining and refining strategic defences such as tracking and verifying AI-generated content by using\nadvanced authentication protocols that utilize blockchain and cryptographic methods; improving content\ntransparency through clear content labelling, content source verification and provenance, and digital water-\nmarking, empowering users to critically assess information authenticity and enhance trust to ensure Gen AI\nis working for not against humanity [9, 43, 44]. This approach is akin to giraffes learning to select the less\nharmful, more nutritious acacia species, ensuring that users can discern truth from AI-generated falsehoods.\nMore advanced and technical approaches like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that help fine-tune\nAI responses are also being developed and refined to improve the contextuality and accuracy of AI-generated\ninformation. Advanced techniques for knowledge retrieval with accurate supporting references, help improve\nreliability and reduce the risks of disinformation and biases in AI-generated content [46,47]. To establish some\nlevel of transparency users are being informed about Gen AI's limitations. That includes communicating\nadequate information disclaimers about the measure of reliability and accuracy of answers to end users\nthrough techniques like 'expressions of uncertainty to reduce over-reliance' [45]. This careful refinement of\nAI responses is comparable to giraffes' meticulous selection of the most suitable acacia trees (trading off the\nmost nutritious, hydrating and rich type of acacia with the ones that are less gracious and more harmful),\nflowers, and leaves, ensuring that AI outputs are relevant and reliable."}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "Social Injustice and Bias: To combat inherent biases in generative AI, humans are fine-tuning algo-\nrithms with diversified, high-quality, or bias-mitigated datasets that reflect a broad societal spectrum [51,52]."}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "Similarly, by introducing novel mitigation training algorithms for models to recalibrate data, ensuring the\nintegrity of sensitive features, and enhancing the explainability and transparency of AI decisions. Towards\nthe application layer and user end, humans are employing techniques like strategic prompt engineering by\ninstructing AI to assume perspectives of specific groups to refine and adjust the model's responses by di-\nversifying outputs based on predefined identities or roles, presenting a more balanced viewpoint. This may\ninclude, providing demographic information in the prompt to improve generated images relevant to the spe-\ncific demographic attributes [51,54]. These strategies are similar to how giraffes adapt to safely forage and\nconsume from a variety of food sources including but not limited to the acacia leaves.\nSafety and Security: Similar to how giraffes develop traits to cope with acacia thorns, ants, and chem-\nicals humans are developing and implementing robust risk frameworks [10], Gen AI tool guidelines [58]\nand regulatory acts (e.g. EU AI Act) [12], policy recommendations that include specific requirements for\ndisclosure, compliance, automated decision making, privacy, and so on [73]. Several advanced techniques in-\ncluding adversarial training and red teaming, and safety specification from the perspectives of various groups\nof stakeholder are continually being developed and applied to enhance AI security to prevent breaches and\nensure that AI systems are as resilient as their biological counterparts [60,74].\n\u2022 Ethical Development Taxonomies and Frameworks\nHumans are developing numerous ethical taxonomies and solution frameworks to guide AI development,\nensuring alignment with societal values [43]. These frameworks address issues such as nefarious use, mis-\ninformation, bias, and social harm. Techniques to mitigate these include monitoring and restricting Gen\nAI to prevent malicious use, employing inclusive design principles, and curbing potential anthropomorphic\nbehaviours that could foster misplaced affection and inappropriate relationships with Gen AI tools [5]. Adap-\ntive governance frameworks dynamically adjust AI operations to societal needs, akin to a giraffe altering its\nforaging strategies in response to environmental challenges.\n\u2022 Auditing and Governance\nHumans are addressing the ethical challenges of Gen AI through structured auditing and governance frame-\nworks. These efforts include technology provider governance audits, pre-release model audits, and application\naudits for LLM-based systems [14]. Ethics-based auditing (EBA) is being explored to ensure AI operations\nalign with moral norms, though challenges such as standardization and effective outcome measurement re-\nmain. Adaptive governance frameworks are developed to dynamically adjust AI operations to societal needs,\ncomplemented by initiatives to enhance public AI literacy. These help individuals navigate and mitigate AI\nrisks effectively [75]. While some researchers are skeptical about the full efficacy of auditing in capturing\nand mitigating all issues, it remains a crucial strategy [44]. Opinions on the effectiveness of auditing vary,\nyet it is actively pursued to address potential ethical concerns of generative AI [44]. Researchers recognize\nthe inherent limitations of auditing in fully capturing and mitigating all potential issues, suggesting that,\nlike the giraffe enduring thorn pricks for nourishment, we may experience some discomfort as we integrate\nthese powerful technologies into society [44].\nSocial Impact and Inequalities: In response to concerns about AI-induced job displacement and social\ninequalities, humans are proactively adapting policies to promote workforce up-skilling and adjustment. As\nGenerative AI reshapes employment sectors and accelerates economic growth, it concurrently introduces\nchallenges like job displacement and exacerbated socioeconomic disparities [65]. To mitigate these issues,\nfocused reskilling initiatives and educational reforms are being tailored to align with the shifting demands"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "of technology. Efforts are particularly concentrated on ensuring that benefits are equitably distributed,\nespecially in regions like the Global South, which encounter unique hurdles in leveraging transformative\ntechnologies [66]. Mirroring how giraffes adapt to navigate the complexities of acacias, humans are crafting\npolicies and developing infrastructures to integrate Generative AI responsibly, promoting ethical, inclusive,\nand sustainable growth globally. Inspired by the giraffes' strategic foraging tactics-judiciously managing\ntheir interaction with acacias to maximize nutritional gains without undue cost-these policies aim to enhance\nhuman capabilities in tandem with AI advancements, ensuring social equilibrium [5,43].\nEmergent Threats: In response to the unforeseen behaviors of AI, humans are adopting advanced moni-\ntoring and responsive governance strategies, akin to how giraffes remain vigilant against the emerging threats\nfrom acacia defenses. When acacias release stress signals that cause nearby trees to increase tannin pro-\nduction in response to heavy foraging, giraffes adapt by moving to areas where tannin concentrations are\nlower. This natural dynamic mirrors the human approach to the unpredictability of AI, where frameworks\nfor evaluation, governance, regular audits, and domain-specific models are being developed to manage these\nemergent capabilities and threats [59,67].\nOne of the most critical risks is the complexity and unpredictability that occur when multiple AI agents\ninteract within the same system. These interactions can lead to emergent behaviours that no single agent\nintends and are difficult to predict and control. Such complexity can result in unforeseen economic, social,\nor political consequences that challenge the required stability and predictability in societal systems. This\nnot only makes it challenging to align AI outcomes with human values but also complicates accountability,\nmaking it hard to determine responsibility for AI-driven decisions.\nCurrent governance structures are evolving but often do not adequately address these complexities, typically\nfocusing too narrowly on individual AI agents rather than their collective impact [76]. Without robust\ngovernance that considers these interactions, we risk developing AI ecosystems that could undermine human\nautonomy and societal cohesion.\nFurthermore, a recent study challenges the notion that emergent abilities in large language models are\ninherent, suggesting these might be artifacts of metric choices. It advocates for smoother, more predictable\nmetrics that could mitigate perceived emergent threats [68]. This strategy echoes the adaptive measures of\ngiraffes against acacia defences, as humans continuously reassess and recalibrate their understanding and\nmitigation of AI risks, ensuring survival in our technological savannah.\nEnvironmental Impact: The intensive energy demands of training and running Gen AI models con-\ntribute to significant carbon emissions, water usage, and soil pollution, raising concerns about their direct\nenvironmental impacts. Efforts to manage Al's carbon footprint are underway, with initiatives aimed at\ndeveloping more energy-efficient technologies [77]. Strategies such as segmenting large models into smaller,\nmore specialized models that search and retrieve information from distinct data corpora are being applied\nto mitigate environmental risks. These approaches could help in reducing the computational load and en-\nergy consumption. Additionally, efforts are focused on enhancing efficiency during both the training and\ninference phases of AI development [43]. Techniques such as pruning, which reduces the complexity of the\nneural network by eliminating unnecessary nodes; distillation, which simplifies models while retaining their\nperformance; and fine-tuning, which adjusts pre-trained models to new tasks more efficiently, are central to\nthese efficiency gains. These strategies collectively aim to reduce the carbon footprint associated with AI\noperations. This reflects the ecological balance giraffes maintain with their habitats. By utilizing smaller"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "parameter models and optimizing data quality, humans strive for less environmentally taxing AI systems,\npromoting sustainability [5, 69]. To reduce the environmental impact of generative AI, humans are imple-\nmenting strategies such as segmenting large models into smaller, efficient units for specific tasks, enhancing\ncomputational efficiency with techniques like pruning, distillation, and fine-tuning to optimize performance\nand reduce energy use [43].\nTransparency and Accountability: To address the profound accountability challenges posed by Gen-\nerative AI, humans are adopting a multifaceted strategy encompassing both policy and technical measures.\nRecognizing the complexity of assigning accountability, especially in legal and ethical realms, there is a\nconcerted effort to define and refine the concept of responsible AI design. Policymakers and technology\ndevelopers are working together to enhance the clarity of AI applications through detailed AI documenta-\ntion and clear communication regarding AI capabilities and limitations. This effort is aimed at preventing\nthe diffusion of responsibility and ensuring that users understand the extent to which they can rely on AI\nsystems [64].\nThe Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), by leading tech and media companies like\nAdobe, BBC, Google, and Microsoft, is setting standards to verify digital content's origin and integrity.\nTheir \"Content Credentials\" standard functions like a digital content \"nutrition label,\" detailing creation\ndata, editing tools, and history in a tamper-resistant format. These credentials are designed to be tamper-\nevident, enhancing transparency and accountability in digital media by clearly marking any alterations.\nImplementing standards like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), alongside\ndeveloping tamper-resistant watermarking and detection classifiers, provide critical defences against the\ntransparency and accountability challenges of Generative AI [70, 71]. These techniques bolster transparency\nand accountability by distinctly marking AI-generated content for easy identification and verification. This\nmethod guides users in recognizing the authenticity of AI-generated media, thereby fostering safer, more\nethical interactions with technology [72]. It parallels how an adult giraffe teaches its young to identify safe\nacacia trees. Accountability in AI is still one of the grand challenges yet to be resolved [64].\n4.2.2 Adaptive Tolerance as Human Defenses (Type-2)\n\u2022 Tolerance of Discomfort in Giraffes and Acacia\nAcacias employ tolerance as a mechanism, a form of passive defence that allows them to recover and thrive\ndespite herbivory (Table 1, Type 2 Defense). Tolerance and endurance enable heavily browsed acacias\nto compensate for damage over time through enhanced shoot regrowth, suggesting a strategic trade-off\nbetween investing in more aggressive (chemical) defences and tolerating damage to conserve resources for\ngrowth and recovery [78]. Similarly, giraffes exhibit tolerance during browsing as they forage for leaves,\ncarefully navigating through menacing thorns. During this delicate operation, they instinctively close their\neyes to protect these vital sensory organs from potential harm. Although they may endure thorn pricks and\ndiscomfort, this is a necessary sacrifice to secure nourishment (Table 1, Type 2 Defense).\n\u2022 Tolerance of Discomfort in Humans with Gen AI\nHumans balance proactive defences with a degree of tolerance, strategically enduring specific negative impacts\nof Generative AI, such as misinformation, economic disruptions, and the spread of fake news, among other\nadverse effects on community dynamics [79,80]. This approach involves more than merely recognizing risks;\nit requires strategic endurance of temporary hardships to sustain progress and exploit significant benefits"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "of AI. Humans engage in a strategic trade-off by accepting Gen AI risks in exchange for ongoing benefits\nsuch as increased efficiency, cost savings, and the spur of innovation. This deliberate endurance is crucial\nin steering AI development towards sustainability and ethical standards, ensuring its evolution benefits all\nsectors of society. Such careful, strategic engagement with Generative AI mirrors the giraffe's calculated\napproach to endure hazards like salivating to neutralize acacia tannins or continued foraging through leaves\nand crushing them in their mouths despite occasionally getting cut by thorns. This is a common strategy\napplied by Humans and Giraffes for optimizing nutrient intake despite potential discomforts (Table 1, Type\n2 Defense.\nGiven the emergent nature of Gen AI technology (i.e. capabilities of these systems continue to emerge after\ndeployment and during use), many ethical implications noted previously and their mitigation remain open\nchallenges for humans.\nBuilding on the analogy, the next section outlines the approach in this paper to examine how humans and\ngenerative AI reciprocally benefits and shape one another within a symbiotic relationship.\n4.3 Mutual Shaping: Humans and Generative AI\nGenerative AI is increasingly becoming a dynamic participant in the choreography of human life, playing a\npivotal role in shaping societal norms. Far from being a passive tool, it acts as an active component within\na broader social, ethical, and technological ecosystem. As it becomes more embedded in social structures, it\ninfluences and is influenced by human actions and policies, illustrating a profound symbiosis between human\nintelligence and artificial capabilities. This represents a significant evolution in our historical narrative of\ntool use, where now, the tools we create learn from and evolve with us. Echoing this sentiment, John M.\nCulkin's insight underscores the profound impact of our creations on our lives:\n\"We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us [81].\"\nBy actively engaging with Generative AI, humans are skillfully navigating its challenges to unlock transfor-\nmative benefits across various sectors. This dynamic engagement situates itself within a broader historical\ncontext, illustrating a symbiotic relationship where human and artificial intelligence are co-evolving, resonat-\ning with the natural equilibrium of the Savannah [82] This interaction not only transforms labour dynamics\nand educational paradigms but also redefines human relationships, demonstrating how profoundly technology\ncan influence, augment, and even manipulate human life, depending on its deployment and interpretation.\nIn the giraffe-acacia analogy, this mutual influence is aptly reflected by the words of David Attenborough:\n\"The tree shapes the giraffe and the giraffe shapes the tree.\"\nThe interplay between humans and Generative AI is deeply reciprocal. Generative AI evolves through human\ninteraction, learning, and refinement, while human strategies, policies, and frameworks adapt in response to\nthe capabilities and outcomes of AI. This collaboration extends beyond traditional boundaries, as AI is an\nactive participant in knowledge creation and the shaping of social norms. This mutual evolution is embedded\nwithin societal frameworks, influencing and being influenced by human rules and norms, and shedding light\non evolving concepts of agency, intelligence, and morality in the age of Generative AI [53,83]."}, {"title": "4.3.1 How Humans Are Shaping Generative AI", "content": "Human Selective \u2018Foraging' Gen AI to Diversify its Growth: Echoing Ludwig Wittgenstein's\nconcept of 'language-games,' Generative AI, powered by various forms of language is progressively emerging\nas a dynamic 'form of life,' and becoming embedded in and reflective of human contexts [84].

By directing Gen AI toward specific\napplications, we enhance its visibility and guide its growth, identifying areas ripe for innovation and driving\nits evolution into more sophisticated and diverse forms, such as multimodal AI and advanced AI bots [5].\nThis active interaction and shaping resembles how a giraffe's pruning promotes healthier acacia trees and\nstimulates new flower growth, mirroring our role in shaping Gen AI diversification and growth.\nHumans Facilitating the Cross-Pollination of Gen AI Acacia: Likewise, much as giraffes unwittingly\nfacilitate the cross-pollination of acacias [41] thereby enriching their genetic diversity\u2014the multitude of\nhuman engagements with AI play a crucial role in its evolutionary trajectory. Our varied interactions seed\nthe landscape of AI development, effectively dispersing a 'pollen' of data and feedback that germinates into\ndiverse and innovative AI functionalities. This ongoing cross-pollination leads to a vibrant ecosystem of\nAI functionalities and applications that continually adapt and grow in utility, generality and complexity,\ndriven by human engagement. Through selective engagement, humans direct AI development and attract\nmore users and developers, much like giraffes attract pollinators to acacias, improving pollination efficiency\nand making Gen AI applications more visible and accessible. This increased attention leads to innovative\nuses and further development of Gen AI technologies. This process, akin to how acaciatree adjust their\ngrowth, architecture and structure in response to giraffe interactions (Table 1), enables Generative AI to\nbroaden its capabilities, increasingly emulating advanced human skills in reasoning, language translation,\ndecision-making, and artistic creation, thus augmenting our potential in the digital era [5].\nHumans Carrying out 'Brain Surgery' of Gen AI to reshape it: Humans are actively shaping\ngenerative AI, challenging its enigmatic nature by delving deep into its inner workings. Utilizing transpar-\nent models and innovative techniques such as 'mechanistic interpretability', we are revealing the concealed\nmechanisms of these complex systems [85,86]. This approach, often likened to AI brain surgery, precisely\nmaps neuron combinations to outputs, clarifying AI decisions and enabling targeted adjustments. Analogous\nto how a giraffe carefully assesses each acacia tree-identifying hidden risks from thorns, chemical defences,\nand resident ants-scientists meticulously unravel AI's complexity. This detailed scrutiny allows for specific\nmodifications that mitigate biases and minimize risks. By deepening our understanding and enhancing the\npredictability of AI behaviours, we establish a foundation for building trust and ethically integrating AI into\nsociety. As we sculpt these generative systems, we transform the 'black box' into a transparent entity, much\nas the giraffe reveals all hidden dangers of the acacia, ensuring our technological advancement aligns with\nethical standards and human values [85].\n4.3.2 How Generative AI Is Shaping Societal Norms and Behaviors\nTechnological evolution, including the rise of Generative AI, fundamentally reshapes social norms and val-\nues. To an extent, it democratizes access to information but also risks creating knowledge monopolies and\npower imbalances. The use of smart technologies in social media is a prime example of how technology can"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "profoundly influence societal constructs, shaping public opinion and personal relationships. As a transfor-\nmative force, Generative AI not only reshapes societal norms and behaviours but also drives evolutionary\nadaptations, mirroring changes seen in natural ecosystems [53,87,88].\nTransforming Conventional Knowledge Evaluation in Education: Generative AI is transforming\neducation by revolutionizing traditional assessment methods and prompting a critical reevaluation of peda-\ngogical practices. By producing detailed, human-like responses to complex academic questions, it is pushing\nthe shift toward assessments that better prepare students for a future dominated by automation. This evolu-\ntion not only highlights the profound impact of technological advancements on how knowledge is assessed and\nvalued but also empowers humans to harness, rather than be subjugated by, the technology they create [89].\nReevaluating Societal Biases Exposed by AI: The data that drive AI technologies often mirror\nsocietal biases, revealing deep-seated prejudices against various ethnic groups and genders. This revelation\nnecessitates a critical reevaluation of our societal values, prompting efforts to address and reform these biases.\nThe visibility of these biases in AI outputs introduces new ethical dilemmas and challenges our understanding\nof technological responsibility and error, prompting a reconsideration of how we handle these issues [90].\nTransforming Teamwork and Collaboration Paradigm: Generative AI, in the form of Advanced AI\nassistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are beginning to reshape societal norms, particularly in\nhow we view teamwork and collaboration. While these technologies offer unprecedented personalization and\ncan improve how we coordinate and cooperate, they also raise ethical concerns related to trust, privacy,\nand the potential for inappropriate emotional attachments or dependencies. Moreover, AI assistants are\ntransforming social interactions, altering traditional modes of communication and teamwork by distributing\nbenefits unevenly-favouring those with greater technological access and literacy. This necessitates strategies\nto enhance accessibility and education, ensuring alignment with diverse user needs, preventing collective\naction problems and promoting equitable impacts across society [2,5].\nEvolving Notions of Creativity and Copyright: The generative capabilities of AI technologies are\nset to profoundly transform the creative processes through which ideas are developed and implemented. As\nthese technologies redefine creativity, they simultaneously prompt shifts across various sectors of society.\nFor example, some (multi-modal) forms of Generative AI are redefining our notions of intellectual property,\ndesign and art, blurring the lines between human and machine creativity. Technologies like GPT and\nDALL-E challenge traditional notions of authorship, compelling a reevaluation of copyright laws to better\naccommodate the integration of human and AI contributions. This evolving landscape also ignites a renewed\ninterest in protecting intellectual property in the digital age [2,83,91].\nTransforming Workforce Dynamics: Redefining Autonomy and Decision-Making: The integra-\ntion of Generative AI (Gen AI) into Human Resources (HR) functions is significantly reshaping workplace\nroles and actively influencing workforce perceptions of core values such as fairness, equity, transparency, and\nautonomy. The initial perception of AI as an objective tool raises expectations, but inherent biases or design\nflaws have led to disillusionment, reshaping how these values are viewed. For instance, the use of algorithms\nfor automatic resume parsing has already skewed perceptions of fairness and transparency. The over-reliance\non AI diminishes the perceived importance of human judgment, effectively outsourcing ethical decisions and\nundermining trust in human-led processes, prompting a reevaluation of workplace norms. Employees in"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "environments heavily reliant on Gen AI report feeling less in control of their professional interactions and\ndecisions, which impacts their engagement and productivity negatively [2,92].\nA study by [93] reveals that 38.9% of job tasks in the Australian workforce are directly influenced by\nlarge language models (LLMs), affecting 36.7% of the time workers dedicate to these tasks. Such extensive\nexposure suggests potential for notable productivity gains or job displacements. Additionally, 12.4% of\ntasks are prone to privacy risks, and nearly 48% of worker time is vulnerable to liability and accountability\nchallenges. These developments profoundly affect perceptions of professional integrity, responsibility, and\ntrust across various sectors, highlighting the ongoing shifts in how workers perceive and value professional\nnorms in an AI-integrated environment.\nGenerative AI also significantly impacts customer service and healthcare, influencing personal autonomy and\ndecision-making. Chatbots in healthcare communication are altering patient perceptions of trust and care\nquality. These chatbots often fail to meet patient expectations, affecting compliance with health management\nadvice. While anthropomorphic design cues can enhance the feeling of social presence, failures to meet the\ncomplex emotional needs of patients can lead to diminished trust in the healthcare system [94]. By mediating\ntraditionally human-led interactions, AI reshapes our views on responsibility and the ethical dimensions of\ntechnological decision-making, underscoring the need for careful oversight and ethical considerations [94].\nReshaping Responsibility in Aviation Safety Culture to Prioritize Data-Driven Decisions:\nWith the emerging influence of Generative AI reshaping societal norms and behaviours, it's valuable to\ncontemplate its potential role in safety-critical domains, we pick aviation as an example. Here, Generative\nAI may significantly reshape the safety culture, which is traditionally anchored in collective values, attitudes,\nperceptions, competencies, and behaviours that embody an organization's commitment to safety [95]. Gen\nAI is likely to shift the traditional value system from one that prioritizes human judgment and experience\nto one that favours data-driven decisions and predictive accuracy. This alteration could reshape perceptions\nof safety management, potentially diminishing the importance of human oversight and promoting reliance\non the perceived infallibility of AI [96]. Such a transformation suggests a redefinition of roles where aviation\npersonnel might adjust their levels of vigilance and oversight, influenced by AI's capabilities to continuously\nmonitor and predict safety risks [97].\nTransforming Competencies and Team Dynamics: The integration of Generative AI will likely trans-\nform the competencies required for aviation roles, necessitating an evolution in training programs to include\nnot only traditional skills but also new proficiencies in managing and interacting with AI systems [96, 98].\nThis shift will significantly affect operational behaviours and team dynamics as AI begins to assume both\nsupportive and supervisory roles, fundamentally reshaping traditional team interactions and decision-making\nprocesses [99]. As aviation teams adapt to these changes, they will need to develop new protocols to ensure\nthat AI-driven recommendations are balanced with human judgment, thereby enhancing rather than under-\nmining the robust safety culture that aviation has long upheld. [100]. This scenario underlines the necessity\nfor adaptive strategies to mould a safety culture that can integrate these new technologies while preserving\nthe critical human elements essential to maintaining safety and efficacy in aviation operations [97]."}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "It is clear from the discussion so far that Generative AI is actively redefining and shaping our ethical\nframeworks, creating new standards of justice and equity as it becomes deeply embedded in our lives.

The escalation of privacy"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "violations, cybersecurity breaches, and unethical AI practices underscores the urgent need for balanced\nstrategies that safeguard individual rights while fostering technological advancement. The subsequent section\nwill explore these challenges, likened to navigating the 'acacia thorns' of Generative AI, focusing on the\nevolving strategies that aim to harmonize the benefits of AI with necessary protective measures.\n5 Meta Analysis: Limits of the Analogy\nWhile the giraffe and acacia tree analogy offers insights into symbiotic relationships, it does not fully capture\nthe complexities of human interactions with Generative AI. There are two main distinctions. First, giraffes\nand acacias are natural entities that have co-evolved over millions of years, perfecting their survival strategies\nin tandem and leading to a finely balanced ecosystem. In contrast, Gen AI is a human construct still in\nits developmental infancy, that comes with many human-induced flaws. Unlike these natural interactions,\nengagements between humans and Generative AI reflect a complex, inherently flawed relationship that\nhighlights significant disparities between naturally evolved ecosystems and human-engineered technologies.\nThese elements make dealing with Gen AI risks additionally challenging.\nBelow we contrast the instinct-driven interactions of giraffes with acacia trees against the complex and often\nethically nuanced interactions between humans and Generative AI. We also analyze and present the factors\nthat make human engagement with this new technology more challenging yet potentially beneficial.\nHuman Biases and Motivations Beyond Survival Unlike the natural defences and instinctual adap-\ntations of acacia trees, which evolve purely for survival, the risks and challenges associated with Generative\nAI are largely born from human design and a complex array of motivations beyond basic survival. Equipped\nwith the cognitive ability to make ethical decisions, humans while engaging with the development and use\nof Gen AI, are influenced by diverse factors such as power, profit, personal gain, or even the drive to disrupt\nsocietal norms. Consequently, in Generative AI's unique landscape, the pursuit of short-term gains can\ncomplicate governance and heighten societal impacts. For instance, the use of machine learning to maximize\nengagement in social media has created what many describe as a Frankenstein Monster, exploiting human\nweaknesses with persuasive technology, the illusory truth effect, Pavlovian conditioning, and Skinner's in-\ntermittent variable reinforcement. This manipulation is akin to the way tobacco companies prioritize profits\nover public health, suggesting a troubling parallel where companies and even countries might find it exces-\nsively profitable, at least in the short term, to continue trafficking in misinformation. Like the historical\nlawlessness of the Wild West, this chaotic exploitation is ultimately unsustainable, as prolonged disorder is\ndetrimental to long-term business stability [101].\nThe Absence of Malice in the Natural World: In nature, interactions such as those between giraffes\nand acacias are instinctual and geared toward survival, devoid of malice. Although giraffes may overbrowse,\npotentially harming the tree, this behaviour is not driven by malice. In contrast, in the domain of technology,\nhuman actors can possess complex motivations, including greed and malice, which can lead to intentional\nmisuse and harm resulting from technology [9]. Unlike natural systems, driven solely by ecological needs,\nGenerative AI can be intentionally designed, utilized, and exploited for harmful purposes, reflecting the dual\naspects of human nature [5, 48-50]. Our ability to bypass safety mechanisms highlights our versatility and\nvulnerability. For example, Gen AI can be covertly trained to activate backdoor behaviours under specific\nconditions, such as embedding exploitable code based on date triggers. This sophistication underscores the"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "challenge in detecting and eliminating such deceptive tactics, highlighting their potential for undetected,\ntargeted attacks [102]. Furthermore, while giraffes and acacias are bound by physical constraints such as\nthe amount of foliage giraffes can consume or the production of toxins acacia can generate humans often\nexceed natural limits, engaging in over-consumption and resource exploitation that lead to societal and\nenvironmental issues. This absence of natural checks and balances in our use of technology can precipitate\nsignificant problems, including climate change and resource depletion [44].\nAdvanced Human Technological Collaboration and Coordination: While the natural world ex-\nhibits its own forms of coordination and adaptive behaviour as seen when acacia trees release tannins in\nresponse to threats and giraffes collectively rear their young-these mechanisms are inherently instinctual\nand confined to specific survival-driven responses. In contrast, human societies harness a far more advanced\nlevel of intelligence and coordination that extends beyond instinctual reactions to embrace innovation. Hu-\nmans not only respond to immediate threats but also engage in complex planning and strategic development\nto anticipate and mitigate a broad spectrum of future challenges. Human strategies can involve deliberate\nforesight and complex social coordination, for instance considering the long-term consequences and ethical\nimplications of Gen AI, drawing on insights from diverse fields such as technology, law, and ethics.\nMoreover, human collaboration and coordination-marked by global communication, cross-cultural ex-\nchanges, and multidisciplinary expertise-far exceeds the biological interactions observed in nature. This\ncollaborative ethos drives societal adaptation and innovation, vastly outpacing natural processes. Our ability\nto rapidly adapt to new technologies and continuously refine our approaches not only can enhance societal\nwell-being but also help align technologies with ethical standards. Consequently, humans uniquely shape and\nadvance their environment, moving beyond the constraints of biological programming through intellectual,\nphysical, and social innovations [103, 104].\nComplex and emerging threats and Human Response Humans navigate a significantly more com-\nplex threat landscape than what is encountered in the natural world by species like giraffes. While gi-\nraffes respond primarily to immediate, tangible threats in their environment\u2014such as predators or food\nscarcity-humans must manage a spectrum of challenges that are both visible and abstract, immediate and\nlong-term. These include technological risks, social inequalities, economic disruptions, and environmen-\ntal changes [105]. The responses required to address these human-centric threats are inherently multidi-\nmensional, involving not just technological solutions but also legal frameworks, ethical considerations, and\ncommunity-focused approaches. Unlike giraffes, whose survival strategies are genetically encoded and largely\nreactive, human strategies are proactive, anticipating future problems and planning for unseen challenges.\nThis forward-looking approach necessitates a deep understanding of potential long-term consequences, diverse\nsocietal impacts, and the ethical ramifications of our technological decisions. For example, AI governance ex-\ntends beyond creating efficient algorithms; it involves ensuring these technologies operate within frameworks\nthat promote social good and prevent harm, guided by robust legislation, ethical standards, and ongoing\npublic dialogue.\nSuch multidisciplinary and anticipatory strategies highlight the sophistication of human societal structures\ncompared to the simpler, instinct-driven dynamics of natural systems. This approach underscores the ne-\ncessity for an integrated strategy that combines diverse fields to navigate the complexities introduced by\nadvanced technologies, ensuring technological advancements align with human interests and uphold societal\nwell-being."}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "Imperfect Gen AI with Human-induced vs Nature's perfection Nature's creations, epitomized by\nthe acacia trees and giraffes, are crafted through millennia of evolutionary refinement, achieving a near-\nperfect state of being that seamlessly integrates into the larger ecosystem. These entities are inherently\nflawless, designed for optimal survival without the burden of ethical dilemmas or flaws. In contrast, human-\nmade technologies like Generative AI are constructed with inherent imperfections, often rushed through\ndevelopment cycles that prioritize innovation over meticulous refinement, leading to systems riddled with\nbiases and vulnerabilities.\nFurthermore, the interactions within natural settings, such as those between giraffes and acacia trees, ex-\nemplify a harmonious balance finely tuned by natural selection. These relationships are devoid of selfish\nmotives or deceit, purely driven by the instinctual need for survival and ecological stability. On the other\nhand, the interaction between humans and Generative AI is complicated by a spectrum of human motiva-\ntions, including malice, personal gain, and power. These factors introduce a level of unpredictability and\nimperfection in how technologies are deployed and utilized, often leading to outcomes that can compromise\nethical standards and societal welfare.\n6 Discussion\n6.1 Humans as Adolescent Giraffes and Generative AI's Challenges\nEngaging with Generative AI presents significant challenges that require us to adapt and innovate, paralleling\nthe way giraffes have developed physical and behavioural adaptations to thrive in the wild. Giraffes utilize\nevery muscle and their unique anatomical features to master their complex environment, a dynamic reflected\nin our need to thoughtfully leverage AI's benefits while mitigating its risks. The ongoing engagement with this\n'thorny' technology has become humanity's daily workout, compelling us to continuously flex our moral and\nintellectual muscles to bolster our resilience and help us effectively navigate and mitigate ethical dilemmas.\nGenerative AI's wide accessibility to the public offers immediate benefits but also inherent risks, similar to\nthe nutritious yet thorny acacia trees that attract adolescent giraffes. This broad availability necessitates\na vigilant and proactive effort to safeguard against potential misuses, akin to the development of safety\nsystems that followed the introduction of transformative technologies such as automobiles and aviation.\nAdolescent giraffes, still mastering the dangers of acacias, humans must adapt to develop their defences\nand immune systems to extract necessary nourishment. Humans are refining strategies to interact with\nAI, evolving from initial efforts to sophisticated methods that manage Generative AI's ethical complexities.\nThese strategies are expected to mature over time, mirroring the giraffe's refined defenses, and enabling us\nto discern truth from AI-generated misinformation while adeptly navigating the landscape of AI ethics and\ngovernance. Addressing these issues requires an ongoing vigilant and proactive approach, comparable to the\ndevelopment of safety systems in response to the advent of transformative technologies such as automobiles\nand aviation. Understanding and regulating AI is a critical, continuous process that ensures its integration\nenhances societal well-being and upholds ethical standards.\nHowever, given the emergent nature of Gen AI technology (i.e. capabilities of these systems continue to\nemerge and expand after deployment and during use), many ethical implications like economic, economic\nand other societal impact/risk assessment and their mitigation remain open questions to resolve."}, {"title": "6.2 Values Debt: Human Induced Ethical Flaws in Gen AI", "content": "Human interactions with Generative AI, unlike natural systems, are driven by a broad spectrum of intentions,\nranging from benign to malicious, and are shaped by a number of factors including the pursuit of innovation,\npower dynamics and market dominance. These complexities are pivotal in grasping the broader implications\nof AI on societal norms and individual behaviours, leading us into a discussion of \u2018Values Debt' [106]-a\nconcept that encapsulates the ethical and operational deficits incurred during the rapid advancement and\ndeployment of Gen AI systems [76]. Similar to conventional software technical debt, both the principal and\nthe ongoing interest must be paid until the debt is fully paid off [107].\nManifestation and Implications Generative AI systems often debut with significant biases, ethical\nissues, and inaccuracies, a stark contrast to the evolutionary precision observed in nature. These flaws\nfrequently stem from the use of poor-quality or non-inclusive training datasets sourced from internet wikis,\nwebsites, blogs, and videos. The rush to capture market share, the pursuit of short-term financial gains,\nresearch agendas, and sometimes a lack of adequate measures or mere oversight contribute to these issues.\nSuch a focus on immediate profits compromises the thoroughness of AI development and prioritizes short-\nterm benefits over long-term safety and ethical considerations.\nConsequently, this approach to AI development leads to the accumulation of \u2018values debt,' where the pursuit\nof technological advancements incurs significant ethical and operational deficits that are difficult to rectify\nonce the systems are deployed [106]. These deficits extend beyond mere technical issues, damaging the\nreputation, brand loyalty, and public image of developers. A notable example includes Google's AI errors,\nsuch as recommending glue on pizza and asserting unfounded facts about celestial bodies errors publicly\nacknowledged but described as unsolvable, at least for now, by the company's leadership [7]. They encourage\nbenefiting from the technology despite these known challenges, suggesting a similar 'tolerance or endurance'\nstrategy discussed previously.\nIn addressing the inherent challenges of misinformation and hallucinations in Generative AI, it is crucial to\nstart with confronting manageable problems such as biased training data and premature model assumptions.\nThis is more likely to align Gen AI outputs to human norms and societal expectations or values. While\nrefining data input methods and enhancing interaction protocols can significantly impact AI accuracy and\nfairness, it is essential to recognize that these measures alone cannot solve all issues related to misinformation.\nHowever, these focused efforts are crucial for mitigating preventable risks and tackling more complex, intrinsic\nchallenges."}, {"title": "7 Recommendations: Fixing Gen AI's Value Alignment", "content": "Generative AI profoundly influences societal norms and values, placing a significant ethical responsibility on\nits designers. As architects of future human conditions, designers are empowered to foster social change and\nbear immense moral responsibilities [108]. However, effectively aligning Gen Al with human values remains\na critical challenge, evidenced by growing instances of value misalignment across various sectors (AI incident\ndatabase, [5,79]).\nOne of the most promising frameworks proposed to address this challenge is the HHH framework by Askell\net al. (2021) [109], which emphasizes that AI assistants should be helpful, honest, and harmless. These three\nprinciples serve as guiding pillars for AI development: - Helpfulness: AI should efficiently and concisely"}, {"title": "Thorns and Algorithms: Acacia & Giraffes vs Generative AI and Humans", "content": "respond to all non-harmful queries, guiding users appropriately. Honesty: AI must provide accurate\ninformation and be transparent about its capabilities and express appropriate levels of uncertainty without\nmisleading human users. Harmlessness: AI should avoid aiding in dangerous acts (e.g. building a bomb)\nor causing offence or harm directly or indirectly through (any modality of) its output, and be considerate of\ncultural sensitivities and ethical implications in its interactions.\nTo operationalize these principles, Gabriel et al. 2024 [5] propose a tetradic relationship framework\nthat involves viewing the relationship among the AI agent, user, developer, and society through a tetradic\nframework. This perspective advocates for a balanced AI system that satisfies the moral claims of all relevant\nparties without disproportionately favouring any single group. For instance, the system should not favour\nthe AI agent or developer at the expense of the user or society, nor should it enable user actions that\ndetrimentally affect societal welfare. However, as noted by the authors of HHH framework, this can not be\nachieved without some obvious trade-offs [109] for example AI is conflicted \u201cbetween helpfulness to the user\nand harmlessness to others if agents are asked to aid in harmful activities.\"\nNevertheless, the HHH framework can be quite effective when used in conjunction with the tetradic model,\nguiding the designers of Gen AI to help them adhere to ethical standards and promote a well-functioning\nsociotechnical system through responsible innovation. This approach challenges developers to rethink AI\ndesign, urging them to integrate these values from the onset to prevent several downstream 'Values Debt'\n[106] manifestations and ensure that AI developments are beneficial and sustainable for all stakeholders\ninvolved.\nThe adoption of the HHH framework, complemented by the tetradic relationship model, provides a robust\nmethodology for aligning AI systems with societal values that remains a considerable challenge [76,77]. It\nrequires a deep understanding of the interactions between AI technologies and societal structures and a\ncommitment to ongoing evaluation and adaptation to ensure these systems remain aligned with evolving\nhuman values.\nHowever, given the complexity of Gen AI, and its massive scale to engage and impact various stakeholders\nin our societies (including developers, researchers, policymakers, and users, mitigation efforts have to work\nin concert and continuously to overcome its challenges (at least most of them).\n8 Conclusion\nThis article has traversed the metaphorical Savannah, drawing parallels between the complex interactions of\ngiraffes and acacias and the evolving relationship between humans and Generative AI. Through this analogy,\nwe have explored the landscape of current risks and mitigation strategies akin to how adolescent giraffes\nnavigate acacia defences. This formative phase of understanding and shaping generative AI addresses ethical\nand operational challenges through ongoing feedback, innovation, evaluation, governance, and regulation.\nWe highlight 'Values Debt' of Gen AI as the additional cost for rapid and thoughtful AI development and a\nmyriad of human motives, emphasizing the need for thoroughness to avert long-term ethical and operational\npitfalls. The 'HHH' framework and the tetradic relationship model have identified pathways to reduce\nthis debt by embedding values of helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in Gen AI agents, advancing the\ndevelopment of safety-aligned agents that resonate with human values.

We deployed FairFare with our partner organization that collaborated with us in collecting data on 76,000+ trips from 45 drivers over 18 months.

In recent years, labor organizers representing rideshare and delivery workers have advocated for regulations to improve working conditions in the rideshare industry that set wage floors and job loss protections [67]. To call for these improvements, organizers need to understand workers' existing conditions [37], a significant data access and social computing challenge in the rideshare industry.\nLabor organizers representing rideshare workers typically rely on a collage of qualitative anecdotes and screenshots to provide data about existing working conditions [24]. While these qualitative data provide rich, \u201cthick descriptions\u201d [30] of workers' experience, they are often dismissed by platforms as non-representative, cherry-picked examples. Rideshare platforms, on the other hand, have exclusive access to large-scale, comprehensive quantitative datasets of driver, trip, and pay data that they can draw upon to create authoritative narratives about working conditions in their industry [72]. Labor organizers need comprehensive access to large-scale quantitative data describing working conditions to conduct rigorous, independent investigations and contest platform-driven narratives.\nThere are tools and legal frameworks that empower individual rideshare workers to independently access quantitative work data (e.g., Gridwise and Data Subject Access Requests). However, these tools and frameworks do not provide an intuitive way to aggregate individual worker data into a dataset that provides collective insight into overarching working conditions. Algorithmic auditing scholarship provides methods, like crowdsourcing data, to independently investigate black-boxed systems [66]. We build on efforts to develop tools for labor [28] to design FAIRFARE\u00b9, a system that supports labor organizers in accessing aggregate, detailed, quantitative payment data for rideshare workers. FAIRFARE is an initial step toward providing labor organizers with access to quantitative data describing pay, one metric of assessing working conditions in the rideshare industry. FAIRFARE is a digital tool that makes aggregating workers' historical work data easier for organizers by reducing the labor and risk involved in the collection. We designed and deployed FAIRFARE with a labor organizing partner rather than individual gig workers to collect data that would specifically be useful for organizers' legislative advocacy efforts.\nWe focused on a specific issue that was informed by early initial engagement and relationship-building with our partner organization, a labor union based in Colorado, interested in influencing a local bill [62]. They identified unfairness in the rideshare industry as a particular area where quantitative data could help their advocacy. We worked with our partner to operationalize this, and designed FAIRFARE to measure take rates: the proportion of a rider's fare that platforms take from each transaction before paying drivers. FAIRFARE is the result of nearly two years of collaboration with our partner organization, involving relationship-building, co-design, deployment, and ongoing evaluation. We continue to maintain FairFare today. In this paper, we describe how we designed, deployed, and evaluated FAIRFAre as a tool to measure the impact of payment algorithms in rideshare work. FairFare was deployed with our partner organization in the summer of 2023. During the deployment, we conducted educational workshops for the partner organization's membership base to introduce the project, gather feedback, and address concerns about the design of FAIRFARE. Our contributions include:\n\u2022 Our collaborative research methodology for investigating rideshare platform take rates that was developed through iterative design with our partner organization and supports data-driven labor advocacy."}, {"title": "2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "content": "2.1 Gig Work, TNCs, and Data\nThe rideshare economy, a significant sector of the gig economy, has become integral to U.S. transportation, with 36% of adults using apps run by Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft to request rides, and 4.3% of the workforce doing app-based work [27]. Despite the prevalence of the rideshare economy, detailed workforce data remain scarce [2, 23, 88]. This data deficit hinders regulatory oversight [35.\nRideshare platforms leverage AI and algorithmically determined dynamic pricing structures that vary the price of rides and, consequently, payment to drivers in an unpredictable and opaque manner. Research demonstrates that dynamic pricing leads to financial and psychological harm for workers because of its unpredictable nature [64, 69]. Concerns about the discriminating effects of dynamic pricing have been raised [15, 59, 80], yet independent, systematic investigation of discriminatory effects remains challenging.\n2.1.1 Rideshare Transparency Policy Initiatives. Transparency initiatives in the rideshare industry are advancing through legislative, regulatory, and grassroots efforts. Recent legislation, such as Washington State's HB 2076 [38], mandates disclosure of ride information, and support for deactivated drivers. Some cities, like New York and Chicago, now require data disclosures, enabling public oversight and revealing issues like price discrimination [59]. However, these datasets remain geographically limited and lack details on gamified features and algorithmic operations. While researchers advocate for comprehensive public transparency reports [53\u201355], drawing from social media transparency practices [52, 56] and generative AI model developers' calls for openness [9], such voluntary disclosures ultimately depend on companies' willingness to participate and their discretion in determining the scope and depth of transparency.\nCurrent legal efforts to support transparency initiatives are hampered by their reliance on the platform's willingness to comply in good faith with data disclosure requests and weak enforcement mechanisms. Further, lacking data, regulatory oversight is hard to instantiate. But without regulatory oversight right now, platforms don not have pressure to share that data. In the European Union, legal frameworks that enforce labor platform transparency have been implemented through Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs). Individual drivers can submit a DSAR to a rideshare platform, and theoretically, the platform would then share a copy of all data collected on that driver [6, 50]. The Worker Info Exchange (WIEX) in London attempted to leverage the legal framework provided by DSARs to collect and aggregate data on behalf of platform workers. However, this effort was"}, {"title": "2.2 Tools and Strategies for Accessing Platform Data", "content": "Platform workers have a long history of using digital tools to combat opaque algorithmic working conditions. Early efforts like Turkopticon [43] and Dynamo [65] enabled Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to collectively rate job posters, subverting the platform's one-sided rating system. Later tools, such as the Shipt Calculator [13], attempted to reduce the human labor required for collective resistance by automating data collection and analysis. Individual resistance efforts have also emerged, with apps like Stopclub\u00b3, Ubercheats\u2074, Maxymo\u2075, and Mystro helping rideshare and delivery drivers calculate rates, identify payment discrepancies, and filter trips. These applications aim to address power asymmetries between individual workers and platforms by leveraging data.\nDespite these advancements, there remains a gap in systematic data aggregation for investigating broader working conditions in app-based work. Historically, labor unions filled this role by maintaining data collection and analysis infrastructures to investigate management technologies' impacts and drive policy change [45]. For instance, Rideshare Drivers United's worker-led study [51] analyzed data from 55 California drivers and 12,000 rides, revealing actual earnings of just $6.20 per hour after expenses \u2013far below Prop 22's promises\u2014 which helped catalyze driver protection laws in other states. However, the decline of labor power\u2077 in the US has diminished this capacity, reducing workers' ability to shape the future of algorithmically managed work [32, 46]. FAIRFARE aims to address this data infrastructure gap by providing labor organizers with a tool to aggregate and analyze working conditions data in the rideshare sector, potentially revitalizing the labor movement's ability to engage in data-driven policy advocacy."}, {"title": "2.3 Opportunities for Algorithmic Auditing", "content": "Rideshare platforms rely on algorithmic decisions to determine key outcomes for drivers, including ride assignments and compensation. Algorithmic auditing, one approach for evaluating such opaque algorithmic systems, could provide workers and organizers with increased platform transparency and accountability [66]. Current audit efforts focus on tool development for harm discovery, standards identification, performance evaluation, and results communication [58]. Algorithmic audits have been successfully used to identify discriminatory impacts of facial recognition systems [12] and reveal biases in job candidate screening algorithms [3, 56, 78], resulting in concrete platform changes. However, studies examining the auditing landscape conclude that audits alone do not achieve accountability. Instead, they help investigate algorithms, which is just one step in the process [58, 83]. Furthermore, black-box audits' effectiveness depends heavily on companies' voluntary cooperation and good faith. Auditors often must rely on companies to provide historical data and deployment access to conduct thorough evaluations [14].\n2.3.1 Crowdsourced Data in Audits. Crowdsourcing data, where many individuals voluntarily contribute data to a project, has become a crucial strategy for independent researchers and auditors. Researchers typically access platform data through two main approaches: (1) scraping, APIs, and public libraries, or (2) privileged access granted by platforms. However, platforms increasingly restrict access by increasing costs, banning researcher accounts [11, 25], and gatekeeping access to their data [10]. In response, crowdsourced data collection is a crucial strategy for independent data access and potential accountability. This approach works around platforms' API usage restrictions and can enable individual community members to more actively participate in the audit process[16, 20].\nCrowdsourced data collection methods range from voluntary data donation platforms like Mozilla Rally\u2078 to compensated participation [1]. Data can be sourced through platform exports [63], browser extensions [79], or even screenshots [13]. Our work contributes to this space by exploring data donation that enables labor organizers to crowdsource historical rideshare and compensation data from drivers. This approach significantly reduces the human labor typically required for collecting and analyzing screenshots, addressing a key challenge in existing crowdsourced data efforts in the rideshare sector [45].\n2.3.2 The Participatory Turn in Auditing. A participatory approach in algorithmic auditing aims to address this accountability gap by involving impacted stakeholders in system development and monitoring [8, 18]. Participatory audit approaches, primarily focused on harms discovery [5, 33, 47, 57, 71], improve end-user experience, but often limit participant agency in audit design and execution. This constraint, coupled with the risk of creating an epistemic burden on community groups when researchers ask them to produce data or engage in the production and upkeep of data for a research project [48, 61], highlights significant gaps in current participatory audit practices as well. Moreover, the existing audit landscape largely focuses on investigating algorithms but often falls short of translating findings into impact for affected communities. We collaborate with labor organizations to co-design an audit and translate technical audit results into a format that helps organizers achieve impact as they defined it\u2013 crafting transparency legislation."}, {"title": "3 CO-DESIGNING A TOPIC AND METHOD OF INQUIRY", "content": "Participatory approaches to algorithmic audits are critiqued for not empowering participants to identify the topic and method of inquiry [8, 19, 58]. This constrains participant agency and limits the epistemological scope of audits [47].

We describe how community members and the research team investigated several possible topics of inquiry that were of interest to the community before mutually agreeing on one that operationalized an overall area of interest (e.g., fairness) in a way that was tractable to measure (e.g., take rate). In late July 2023, an organizer from our partner organization suggested we investigate \u201ctake rate,\u201d the share of a customer fare that the platform extracted from each ride, as a way of assessing fairness in rideshare work. The organizer had heard from several members who reported that passengers told them they were being charged amounts more than what the drivers were receiving from the platform. During a subsequent meeting with members and organizers from our partner organization, the research team proposed that we follow up on the union members' interest in \u201ctake rates\u201d and center the inquiry on this topic. Members from our partner organization were enthusiastic. Several recounted instances where an angry passenger got into their car and complained about paying an exorbitant price, which prompted drivers to show the passengers how much they were getting paid for the ride to de-escalate the situation.\nThrough iterative conversations with organizers and members from our partner organization, we co-designed the topic of inquiry, \u201ctake rate\u201d. This inquiry was more tractable to investigate than offer data and aligned with partner organization interests. The remainder of the summer"}, {"title": "3.2 Iterating on a Technical Approach", "content": "The method identified by the research team fulfilled the technical requirements of the project: it would produce data about both the rider price and driver pay. However, through discussion with our partner organization, we quickly realized that just because a data collection method is technically feasible does not mean that it is appropriate. Union members highlighted that collecting rider data posed significant risks for drivers, including potential deactivation from customer complaints about discussing pay or violating the terms of service (ToS) rules against third-party advertising. They feared such complaints could lead to serious financial consequences as drivers could be deactivated (e.g., fired) as a result of customer complaints. As a result, the research team went back to the drawing board to brainstorm how this data could be collected from riders while minimizing risk to drivers. One of the research team members discovered Argyle, a third-party system that branded itself as ADP, a payroll management software, but for non-traditional work. A team member discovered the Argyle API provided customer price data and tested it by requesting rides from another team member who was an Uber driver and comparing the data in Argyle with the amount paid and received by the two team members, confirming its accuracy. Following these successful tests, the team proposed using Argyle to investigate take rates.\nIn August of 2023, the research team proposed using Argyle to collect customer and driver payment data in a way that minimized risk to drivers (e.g., they would not have to facilitate conversations with passengers or hang signs in their cars to know how much a passenger paid). Organizers and members from our partner organization approved this method for conducting the inquiry and voiced satisfaction that their concerns about driver safety in participating in the research study were attended to. Thus, starting in September 2023, the interface design for FAIRFARE began. Throughout the interface design process, our partner organization provided regular input into the content and language presented on the FAIRFARE interface.\nThroughout the remainder of 2023, our partner organization invited us to coalition meetings with other labor unions representing rideshare workers. Through these meetings, we formed relationships with three other labor unions interested in using the FairFare tool to collect wage data with their members. These partner organizations were broadly interested in having access to any type of independent, aggregate quantitative wage data but did not have a specific legislative or organizing goal they wanted to support with data. We supported these organizations' efforts and developed recruitment and onboarding materials to help them sign up their members. In this paper, we focus on our field deployment and evaluation with our original partner organization, as they were our primary co-design partner who played the most active role in co-designing FAIRFARE."}, {"title": "3.3 Research team positionality", "content": "The process of engaging and co-designing with our partner organization was shaped by our positionality as researchers. While we are all HCI scholars, one of us is also a part-time union organizer with our partner organization. Here we describe our positionality in more detail to reflect on how it our study.\nOur interdisciplinary team includes experts in HCI, AI, & Machine Learning, Technology Ethics, and Policy. As academics advocating for platform transparency, we have engaged with gig workers, policymakers, and union organizers. Some of us are involved in designing decentralized platforms to mitigate Al's negative labor impacts, one author is a part-time organizer with our partner organization, and one author works as a part-time Uber driver. Our positionality influenced data interpretation and participants' engagement. Despite practicing reflexivity and adhering to ethical research practices, we acknowledge potential biases, including sympathy towards organizers and workers as a result of non-transparent AI and algorithmic rideshare platform decisions. These biases likely impacted our data collection and analysis processes. In particular, we likely had response biases [60] in our interviews with organizers when we asked them to reflect on how our system helped them achieve their goals. Organizers were largely uncritical of FAIRFAre in their interviews, which could reflect their reluctance to criticize the research team with whom they planned to continue partnering to support their data collection needs. We further unpack organizers' overwhelmingly positive views about FairFare and quantitative data more broadly in our discussion.\nThe process of designing FAIRFARE was collaborative and reflexive\u2014we relied on our partner organizations to direct the topic and method of inquiry. As researchers, the initial method we proposed seemed sensible to us. However, our partner organizations' concerns pushed us to reflect on the potential harms of participating in research studies we were not previously aware of.

The system aligned with an ongoing policy effort in Colorado to address pay transparency and fairness in rideshare work. Through conversations with our partner organization's organizers, we identified the following key design needs:\n(1) Collect data on driver earnings and rider cost, to estimate platform take rate. To calculate take rate, both the consumer cost of a trip and the net driver pay should be collected.\n(2) Make driver data donation as seamless as possible. Organizers mentioned a prior data collection process that asked workers to manually submit screenshots to organizers. If possible, making the data sharing process more automatic would help organizers in their recruitment.\n(3) Provide access to aggregate data. Organizers stressed the importance of aggregate data about fare take and pay to better understand the state of driver earnings, test claims made by drivers, and present a defensible perspective to lawmakers. They saw individual drivers benefiting mainly from \u201ccollectivizing\u201d data for policy advocacy rather than improving individual decision-making.\n(4) Enable production of public reports and visuals.

Trip data, which is the main data FAIRFARE collects, necessarily includes information on work locations and times. Patterns in this data could potentially be used to identify individual drivers, exposing them to retaliation risk by the platform.\nWe designed FAIRFARE to minimize this risk while still enabling meaningful data aggregation for advocacy. We store personal identifying information, such as names, contact details, and account IDs in an isolated table with restricted access. Data on trip details and earnings are stored separately, with row-level security that ensures drivers can only access their own records. Broader data access is only available through an administrator key that is never exposed client-side and not shared outside the research team. Drivers maintain control over their data and can request complete deletion at any time through a contact form in the web app. At the time of deployment this process was handled manually, but it has since been replaced by an automated system that ensures immediate data deletion and un-enrollment from the study.\nWe rely on a third-party service, Argyle \u00b9\u2070, to reliably access platform data. Argyle significantly lowers barriers to participation by making data sharing a simple process for drivers. Argyle's terms of service also help ensure worker privacy in two key ways. First, Argyle's ToS explicitly limits the authorized use of worker data by only accessing and transferring worker's data to specific partners that workers have consented to (in this case, FAIRFARE). Second, their terms clearly states that Argyle has \u201cno relationship\" with sources of data like Uber's driver platform. This means that Argyle has no contractual obligations to share information, such as a driver's affiliation with FAIRFARE, with data sources like rideshare platforms. [42].\nHowever, this makes FAIRFARE dependent on their privacy practices and requires an additional layer of trust from drivers\u2014they must trust Argyle as well as the FAIRFARE tool. There are two main risks that using Argyle introduces. First, the risk that Argyle may re-sell access to participant data, and second, the risk that the TNC may learn which workers are participating in the study. TNCs could still potentially discover which workers contributed data through subpoenas or court orders. This risk is reflective of the well-documented difficulties of conducting independent academic research into black-boxed, platform owned systems [73].

On the driver payroll account for Uber on a desktop, drivers get access to weekly summaries including rider prices; but it is a convoluted and manual process many drivers don't know about, not all drivers have access to this, and rider prices per ride are not available. Organizers also explained that to collect the necessary data for take rate calculations, drivers previously had to talk to passengers and ask them how much they paid for their ride, which could risk deactivation: \u201cdrivers were being deactivated...because they're not supposed to be having those kind of conversations with passengers.\u201d FAIRFAre was \u201ca pathway to getting that information without the driver being at risk of [the platform] saying he harassed the passenger.\u201d The design of the FAIRFARE tool helped eliminate this risk, making collecting data about drivers easier and less dangerous for drivers."}, {"title": "6.3 Opportunities for Expanding FairFare's Data Offerings", "content": "6.3.1 Need for Broader Driver Participation and More Granular Time Data. Organizers identified two key areas for improving FairFare's datasets. First, they emphasized the need for wider driver participation: \u201cIt would be great to have a bigger data set in our locale. I think there's quite a bit of data you all have already collected, but it would be nice to have even more drivers.\u201d This broader participation would provide a more representative picture of driver experiences. However, expanding participation faces challenges, as organizers noted: \u201cI know part of the problem is just getting people to sign up for it, right? Because some people are wary no matter how many times we say to download this.\u201d This wariness likely stems from concerns about data privacy and potential platform retaliation as rideshare platforms already collect extensive personal information including location data, payment details and behavioral details, highlighting critical barriers to long-term tool adoption. Moreover, these audits rely on marginalized over-researched populations that are wary of participating in research studies. The wariness expressed in this quote is also likely a manifestation of the overall caution with which the gig worker population approches researchers."}, {"title": "6.3.2 Organizers Want to Measure the Effects of Policy Interventions.", "content": "Organizers are interested in being empowered to do their own research to evaluate the effectiveness of different policy interventions across jurisdictions. They proposed to \u201csee overall across the US how they're trending after any kind of legislation has been passed at the state or the local level and see if it's better than those states or cities who have not passed any legislation.\u201d This approach would provide insights into which legislative approaches truly improve driver conditions, guiding future policy decisions with empirical evidence."}, {"title": "6.3.3 Need for Long-Term Temporal Analysis."}]}

This allows considering the temporal dimension, when reasoning about the defeasible typicality properties of a system, for explanation, such as by capturing the dynamics of a weighted Knowledge Base (KB) (Alviano et al. 2024).\nPreferential extensions of LTL with defeasible temporal operators have been recently studied (Chafik et al. 2021; Chafik et al. 2020; Chafik 2022) to enrich temporal formalisms with non-monotonic reasoning features, by considering defeasible versions of the LTL operators. Our approach, instead, will consist in adding the standard LTL operators to a (many-valued) conditional logic with typicality, an approach similar to the preferential extension considered for Description Logics (DLs) in (Alviano, Giordano, and Theseider Dupr\u00e9 2023c), where the logic LTLACC (Lutz,"}, {"title": "2 A Many-valued Preferential Logics with Typicality", "content": "In this section we define a many-valued propositional logic with typicality.\nLet L be a propositional many-valued logic, whose formulas are built from a set Prop of propositional variables using the logical connectives \u2227, \u2228, \u00ac and \u2192, as usual. We assume that \u22a5 (representing falsity) and \u22a4 (representing truth) are formulas of L. We consider a many-valued semantics for formulas, over a truth degree set D, equipped with a preorder relation \u2264D, a bottom element 0D, and a top element 1D. We denote by <D and ~D the related strict preference relation and equivalence relation (often, we will omit explicitly referring to D, and simply write < ,\u223c , 0 and 1).\nLet \u2297, \u2295 , \u0398, and \u25b7 be the truth degree functions in D for the connectives \u2227, \u2228, \u00ac and \u2192 (respectively). When D is [0, 1] or the finite truth space Cn = {0, 1, ..., n-1, n}, for an integer n \u2265 1, as in our case of study (Alviano, Giordano, and Theseider Dupr\u00e9 2023b), \u2297, \u2295 , \u0398 and \u25b7 can be chosen as a t-norm, an s-norm, an implication function, and a negation function in some system of many-valued logic (Gottwald 2001); for instance, in G\u00f6del logic (that we will consider later): a \u2297 b = min{a, b}, a \u2295 b = max{a, b}, a \u25b7 b = 1 if a \u2264 b and b otherwise; and \u0398 a = 1 if a = 0 and 0 otherwise.\nWe further extend the language of L by adding a typicality operator as introduced by Booth et al. (Booth et al. 2019) for propositional calculus, and by Giordano et al. for preferential description logics (Giordano et al. 2007). Intuitively, \"a sentence of the form T(\u03b1) is understood to refer to the typical situations in which \u03b1 holds\" (Booth et al. 2019). The typicality operator allows the formulation of conditional implications (or defeasible implications) of the form T(\u03b1) \u2192 \u03b2 whose meaning is that \"normally, if \u03b1 then \u03b2\", or \"in the typical situations when \u03b1 holds, \u03b2 also holds\". They correspond to conditional implications \u03b1 \u00b5 \u03b2 of KLM preferential logics (Lehmann and Magidor 1992). As in PTL (Booth et al. 2019), the typicality operator cannot be nested. When \u03b1 and \u03b2 do not contain occurrences of the typicality operator, an implication \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 is called strict. We call LT the language obtained by extending L with a unary typicality operator T. In the logic LT, we allow general implications \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 may contain occurrences of the typicality operator.\nThe interpretation of a typicality formula T(\u03b1) is defined with respect to a preferential interpretation. The KLM preferential semantics (Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990; Lehmann and Magidor 1992; Pearl 1988) exploits a set of worlds W, with their valuation and a preference relation < among worlds, to provide an interpretation of conditional formulas. A conditional A B is satisfied in a preferential interpretation, if B holds in all the most normal worlds satisfying A, i.e., in all <-minimal worlds satisfying A."}, {"title": "2.1 KLM properties of conditionals", "content": "The KLM properties of a preferential consequence relation can be reformulated in the many-valued setting, then proving that, for the choice of combination functions as in G\u00f6del logic, they hold for 1-entailment.

For the KLM logics, some different closure constructions have been proposed to strengthen entailment by restricting to a subset of the preferential models of a conditional knowledge base K. Let us just mention, the rational closure (Lehmann and Magidor 1992) (or system Z (Pearl 1988)) and the lexicographic closure (Lehmann 1995), but also other constructions, such as the MP-closure (Giordano and Gliozzi 2021), which exploit a similar idea, but using a different kind of lexicographic ordering to define the preference relation.\nIn the following we consider a construction that has been proposed for weighted knowledge bases in defeasible description logics, where defeasible implications have a weight. We reformulate the semantics in a propositional context, for the temporal case, by assuming that D is the unit interval [0, 1] or a subset of it (e.g., the finite set D = Cn, for some n \u2265 1). The two-valued case D = {0, 1} is also a special case.\nA weighted KB is a set of weighted typicality implication of the form (T(Ai) \u2192 Bj, wij), where Ai and Bj are propositions, and the weight wij is a real number, representing the plausibility or implausibility of the conditional implication. For instance, for a proposition student, we may have a set of weighted defeasible implications:\n(T(student) \u2192 has_Classes, +50), (T(student) \u2192 \u25c7 holds_Degree, +30), (T(student) \u2192 has-Boss, -40),\nthat represent prototypical properties of students, i.e., that a student normally has classes and will eventually reach the degree, but she usually does not have a boss (negative weight). Accordingly, a student having classes, but not a boss, is more typical than a student having classes and a boss. Similarly, one may introduce a set of weighted conditionals for other propositions, e.g., for employee.\nBased on the set of conditionals, one can establish the preferences between the different worlds with respect to different propositions Ai. For instance, consider an interpretation I = (W, {<nAi}n \u2208 N, v) in which a world w describes a student (v(0, w, student) = 1) that in the initial state has classes (v(0, w, has_Classes) = 1) but not a boss (v(0, w, has_Boss) = 0), and that at time point 8 will reach the degree (v(8, w, hold_Degree) = 1) ; while world w' describes a student v(0, w', student) = 1 that in the initial state has classes (v(0, w', has_Classes) = 1) and has a boss (v(0, w', has_Boss) = 1), and will reach the degree at time point 7 (v(7, w', hold_Degree) = 1.\nThe idea is that the preference relation <student in I should consider the situation described at w at time point 0, more normal than the situation described by w', i.e., w 1\nDefinition 7.

In this section we aim at instantiating the proposed temporal logic to the gradual argumentation setting, to make it suitable for capturing the dynamics of an argumentation graph (e.g., the changes of weights of edges in time).\nThe idea in (Alviano, Giordano, and Theseider Dupr\u00e9 2023d) was to provide a general approach for developing a preferential interpretation from an argumentation graph G under a gradual semantics S, provided some weak conditions on the domain of argument interpretation are satisfied and, specifically, that the domain of argument interpretation D is equipped with a preorder relation < (which is a widely agreed requirement (Baroni, Rago, and Toni 2018; Baroni, Rago, and Toni 2019)). As it may be expected, the domain of argument interpretation D plays the role of the truth degree set of our many-valued semantics introduced above.\nFor the definition of an argumentation graph, let us adapt the notion of edge-weighted QBAF by Potyka (Potyka 2021) to a generic domain D. A (weighted) argumentation graph is a quadruple G = (A, R, \u03c3 0, \u03c0), where A is a set of arguments, R \u2286 A \u00d7 A a set of edges, \u03c3 0 : A \u2192 D assigns a base score of arguments, and \u03c0 : R \u2192 R is a weight function assigning a positive or negative weight to edges.\nA labelling \u03c3 of G over D is a function \u03c3: A \u2192 D, which assigns to each argument an acceptability degree (or a strength) in the domain of argument valuation D. Whatever semantics S is considered for an argumentation graph G, we assume that S identifies a set \u03a3S of labellings of the graph G over a domain of argument valuation D.\nA semantics S of G can then be regarded, abstractly, as a pair (D, \u03a3S): a domain of argument valuation D and a set of labellings \u03a3 over the domain.\nIf we consider all arguments Ai \u2208 A as propositional variables, each labelling \u03c3 can be regarded as a world wo \u2208 W in a many-valued preferential interpretation MG = (W, {0"}, {"title": "6 Conclusions", "content": "The paper proposes a framework in which different (many-valued) preferential logics with typicality can be captured, together with their temporal extensions, with the operators from LTL. The interpretation of the typicality operator is based on a multi-preferential semantics, and an extension of weighted conditional knowledge bases to the temporal (many-valued) case is proposed.\nThe approach is parametric with respect to the choice of a specific many-valued logic (with their combination functions), but also with respect to the definition of the preference relations , which may exploit different closure constructions, among the many studied in the literature, in the spirit of Lehmann's lexicographic closure (Lehmann 1995). The two-valued case, with a single preference relation can as well be regarded as a special cases of this preferential temporal formalism.\nOn a different route, a preferential logics with defeasible LTL operators has been studied in (Chafik et al. 2020; Chafik et al. 2023). The decidability of different fragments of the logic has been proven, and tableaux based proof methods for such fragments have been developed (Chafik et al. 2021; Chafik et al. 2023).

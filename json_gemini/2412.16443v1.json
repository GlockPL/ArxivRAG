Unified Insights into LLM Regularities and Constraints", "authors": ["Charles Luo"], "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their scalability raises a critical question: Have we reached the scaling ceiling? This paper addresses this pivotal question by developing a unified theoretical framework that integrates mathematical and statistical insights to explain the scaling dynamics of LLMs. We present three key contributions:\n\nCentral Limit Theorem (CLT) for Hidden Representations: We show that noise in hidden representations scales inversely with context size, explaining stabilization effects and the limits of context length improvements.\nBias-Variance Decomposition: We decompose next-token prediction loss into irreducible entropy, capacity-driven bias, and finite-sample variance, revealing trade-offs where scaling yields diminishing returns.\nEmergent SNR Thresholds: By defining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we quantify how capabilities emerge abruptly once SNR surpasses a threshold, offering insights into when scaling becomes less effective.\n\nThrough this framework, we conclude that while LLMs have not reached an absolute scaling ceiling, practical constraints-diminishing returns, resource inefficiencies, and data limitations are increasingly prominent. Future progress will require a shift from brute-force scaling to innovations in architecture, data quality, and training paradigms. This work provides a roadmap for guiding the efficient development of next-generation LLMs and advancing the field beyond traditional scaling strategies.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs)\u2014notably GPT, PALM, and LLaMA-have demonstrated remarkable capability across diverse language tasks.

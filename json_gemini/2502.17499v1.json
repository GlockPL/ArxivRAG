Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, the\nincreasing prevalence of CVDs in aging populations and low- and middle-income\nregions underscores the urgent need for early detection and intervention strategies[2].\nAs such, early identification and monitoring of cardiac abnormalities are critical to\nmitigating the societal and economic impact of these diseases. In recent years,\nwearable devices have emerged as transformative tools in healthcare, particularly in\nthe field of cardiac monitorin[3-8]. These devices provide non-invasive, continuous\nmeasurement of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, bridging the gap between traditional\nintermittent medical assessments and real-world patient management[9]. Their portability\nand ability to transmit data in real-time have expanded their use in detecting transient\ncardiac abnormalities and improving patient engagement in disease management[10]. The\npotential for wearable devices to democratize access to cardiac care makes them\nindispensable in modern preventive and personalized medicine. Accurate computation\nof ECG parameters such as heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT intervalis\nessential for diagnosing and predicting arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and other\ncardiovascular conditions. These parameters are critical not only for risk stratification\nbut also for guiding therapeutic decisions in clinical practice[11]. Furthermore, their\nprecise measurement plays a key role in large-scale population health initiatives and\npersonalized medicine approaches, where actionable data from wearables can inform\nearly interventions[12]. Developing robust computational methods that align with the\naccuracy of conventional ECG machines and expert evaluations remains a crucial step\nin realizing the full potential of wearable technologies.\nRecent advancements in wearable ECG devices have spurred the development of\nvarious methods for calculating ECG parameters, such as heart rate, PR interval, QT\ninterval, and T-wave amplitude, which are crucial for continuous cardiac monitoring\noutside of clinical settings. These devices leverage a range of signal processing and\nmachine learning techniques to improve accuracy, with studies demonstrating their\nability to extract reliable ECG features even under conditions of motion artifacts and\nlow signal quality[13-15]. Ho et al. [13] validated the accuracy of Apple Watch and\nGarmin Forerunner in prescribing exercise intensity via heart rate, finding high\nconsistency with ECG measurements in healthy adults. Hwang et al. [14] assessed the\naccuracy of Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy, and Fitbit in measuring heart rates during\nsupraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and found them generally accurate, though\nperformance varied among devices. Lu et al.[15] demonstrates a high correlation (r=0.84,\np<0.01) and strong consistency between wearable ECG devices and traditional ECG\nmachines in measuring heart rate, with a mean difference of -0.97 bpm and 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) within an acceptable range, indicating reliable usage in\narrhythmia detection and heart rate monitoring. However, while these studies have\nmade significant progress in enhancing wearable ECG devices' capability for\narrhythmia detection and real-time monitoring[16,17], there is a gap in comprehensive"}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "This study employed a large-scale, multi-center, real-world design to validate ECG\nparameter calculation methods of wearable devices by comparing them to standard\nECG machines and clinician assessments. Three distinct datasets were utilized in this\nstudy (Table 1, Figure 2). The first dataset (AHMU-FH) was collected from the First\nAffiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, encompassing 88,874 participants and\nrepresenting various clinical conditions and scenarios. The second dataset was the\nEuropean Common Standards for Electrocardiography (CSE) dataset, comprising 107\nparticipants, and widely recognized as a benchmark for validating ECG-related\nmethodologies. The third dataset HeartVoice-ECG-lite consisted of wearable ECG data\ncollected through the WenXinWuYang[18,19], which included 369 participants. These\ndatasets provide complementary perspectives: the hospital dataset reflects real-world\nclinical practice, the CSE dataset offers a standardized reference, and the wearable\ndevice dataset emphasizes the practical applications of emerging technologies. By\ncombining these diverse sources, the study enables a robust evaluation of wearable\nECG parameter calculation methods under both controlled and real-world conditions,\nhighlighting the potential for wearable devices to contribute to scalable and accessible\ncardiac health monitoring.\nThe HeartVoice-ECG-lite dataset was derived from wearable device data collected\nthrough the WenXinWuYang, focusing on real-world cardiac health monitoring\nscenarios. This dataset underwent meticulous annotation by two experienced\ncardiologists (Doctor A and Doctor B) using a specialized annotation system designed\nfor precise identification of ECG waveform positions (Table 1). The annotation\nprocess prioritized the accurate delineation of key waveform features, such as P waves,\nQRS complexes, and T waves, ensuring high reliability and clinical relevance of the\nannotations. Each cardiologist independently reviewed the data, and any discrepancies\nin annotations were resolved through consensus discussions to maintain consistency\nand minimize subjective bias. This rigorous approach aimed to provide a gold\nstandard reference for evaluating the performance of ECG parameter calculation\nmethods derived from wearable devices. By incorporating expert-level annotations, the\nHeartVoice-ECG-lite dataset offers a valuable resource for benchmarking algorithm\naccuracy in diverse and practical settings, highlighting its importance in advancing the\nfield of wearable ECG technology for scalable and reliable cardiac health monitoring.\nThe preprocessing of the ECG signals was a critical step to ensure the accuracy and\nreliability of subsequent parameter calculations. Initially, a median filter was applied to\nthe raw ECG data to eliminate baseline drift and other low-frequency artifacts\neffectively. This step is crucial in preserving the integrity of the ECG waveform by\nremoving noise that could obscure the true signal morphology. Following this, a\nbandpass filter was employed to refine the signal by removing non-ECG frequency\ninterferences, such as muscle noise and electromagnetic interference, thereby isolating\nthe frequency components pertinent to cardiac activity. In addition, a comprehensive\nsignal quality assessment was performed on the preprocessed data. This evaluation\nutilized a scoring system designed to quantify the overall quality of the ECG signal,\nconsidering factors such as signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of motion artifacts.\nFor this study, any ECG recordings that received a signal quality score below 0.5\nwere excluded from further analysis. This rigorous preprocessing pipeline ensured that\nonly high-quality ECG data were utilized for parameter calculation and subsequent\ncomparison with standard ECG machines and clinician assessments, ultimately\nenhancing the robustness and clinical relevance of the study findings.\nThe FeatureDB\u00b9 is a dedicated method developed for the computation of ECG\nparameters from single-lead ECG signals acquired by wearable devices [18,19]. This\nmethod employs a multi-stage approach to accurately extract and calculate clinically\nrelevant ECG parameters. Initially, FeatureDB detects the peak positions of the\nprimary waveform components, namely the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave, by\nemploying robust peak detection algorithms. This initial detection is critical for\nestablishing a reliable foundation for subsequent analyses. Following the identification\nof the waveform peaks, the method applies multiple wavelet transforms to accurately\ndetermine the start and end positions of the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave.\nWavelet transforms are particularly advantageous in this context due to their ability to\nanalyze signals at various frequency scales, thus providing enhanced sensitivity to\nsubtle changes in the ECG signal morphology. The refined delineation of waveform\nboundaries obtained through the wavelet-based approach allows for precise localization\nof key features, which is essential for the accurate computation of ECG parameters\nsuch as the PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc. Subsequently,\nFeatureDB applies established calculation rules to the delineated waveform features to\nderive the desired ECG parameters. These calculation rules are based on clinically\nvalidated definitions and ensure that the computed parameters are consistent with\nstandard diagnostic criteria. The integration of robust peak detection with multi-scale\nwavelet analysis enables FeatureDB to effectively handle the inherent noise and\nvariability present in wearable ECG recordings. Furthermore, the method is designed\nto be computationally efficient, making it well-suited for real-time or near-real-time\napplications in wearable technology."}, {"title": "Statistical analysis", "content": "Continuous variables conforming to normal distribution are presented as mean \u00b1\nstandard deviation, Continuous variables conforming to abnormal distribution are\npresented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR).

Bland-Altman plots were\nused to assess the level of consistency between two methods or devices, with mean\nand 1.96 standard deviation (SD).

These parameters, derived from both standard ECG\nmachines and wearable devices via FeatureDB, offer quantifiable metrics that correlate\nstrongly with pathological states. By comparing these values across different modalities,\nwe can assess the reliability and clinical relevance of wearable device measurements.\nThe ROAUC was 0.836, indicating good diagnostic characteristics for FeatureDB\nin detecting LQT. Meanwhile, FeatureDB also showed high accuracy in the detection\nof LQT, with a value was 0.856. The Sensitivity and Specificity were 0.815 and\n0.856, respectively (Figure 3A). The QT interval distributions for LQT and non-LQT\npatients measured by FeatureDB and standard ECG machines exhibit high consistency.\nBoth methods yield similar QT interval distributions, indicating that the wearable\ndevice-based approach aligns well with traditional ECG measurements in distinguishing\nLQT from non-LQT patients. (Figure 3B and C). In the evaluation of AVBI, we\nobserved distinct distribution patterns in the PR interval. Standard ECG machines\neffectively separated non-AVBI patients from those with AVBI using a 200 ms\nthreshold. However, FeatureDB's PR interval calculations did not conform to this\ncutoff. Instead, our distribution analysis indicated that a threshold of 150 ms is more\nappropriate for FeatureDB-derived measurements (Figure 3D). Employing this 150 ms\nthreshold for AVBI determination, the method achieved a ROAUC of 0.861, an\naccuracy of 0.845, a sensitivity of 0.877, and a specificity of 0.845, indicating robust\ndiagnostic performaEnce (Figure 3E).\nOverall, the performance of FeatureDB in calculating key ECG parameters is\nhighly encouraging. Its close agreement with standard ECG measurements in both QT\nand PR intervals validates its diagnostic precision. These findings support the adoption\nof wearable device-based approaches as effective alternatives for real-time cardiac\nmonitoring, with significant potential to enhance patient management and clinical\ndecision-making in diverse healthcare settings.\nThe correlation between FeatureDB and ECG machines (AHMU-FH) was statistically\nsignificant in electrocardiographic parameters. The correlation coefficients of PR\ninterval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTc interval were 0.634, 0.169, 0.729, and\n0.623, respectively, indicating that the detection results of FeatureDB and ECG\nmachines with electrocardiographic parameters had a significant positive correlation\n(Table 2). There were correlation coefficients of electrocardiographic parameters for\ndifferent ECG rhythms between FeatureDB and ECG machines (Table S1).\nBland-Altman plots showed that measurements of PR interval, QRS duration, QT\ninterval, and QTc interval were distributed withinthe limits of agreement for 95.74%,\n90.88%, 92.72%, and 92.73% data, respectively, indicating a high degree of agreement\nbetween FeatureDB and ECG machines (Figure 4).\nThe correlation between FeatureDB and clinician assessments from the CSE dataset\nwas statistically significant in electrocardiographic parameters. The correlation\ncoefficients of PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were 0.733, 0.553, and\n0.626, respectively, indicating that the detection results of FeatureDB and clinician\nassessments withelectrocardiographic parametershad a significant positive correlation\n(Table 3).\nBland-Altman plots showed that measurements of PR interval, QRS duration, and\nQT interval were distributed within the limits of agreement for 98.10%, 94.29%, and\n92.38% data, respectively, indicating a high degree of agreement between FeatureDB\nand Clinician assessments (Figure 5).\nThe correlation between FeatureDB and Doctor A's or Doctor B's assessments from\nthe HeartVoice-ECG-lite dataset (HeartVoice-ECG-lite) was statistically significant in\nelectrocardiographic parameters.

Meanwhile, the correlation"}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "This study validates the accuracy of wearable devices in calculating ECG parameters\nby comparing FeatureDB with ECG machines and clinician assessments. FeatureDB is\na method specifically proposed for calculating single-lead ECG parameters in wearable\ndevices. In this study, the FeatureDB algorithm was used to compute ECG parameters,\nincluding PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. In this study, FeatureDB was compared\nwith standard ECG machines and different clinician assessments, respectively\n(AHMU-FH, CSE, HeartVoice-ECG-lite). The results indicate that the ECG parameters\ncalculated by FeatureDB demonstrate acceptable reliability. Although the correlation\ncoefficient for QRS was below 0.2 in some cases, particularly in comparisons between\nFeatureDB and standard ECG machines, the correlation coefficients for PR, QT, and\nQTc were all above 0.6, indicating acceptable reliability. Additionally, in the\nconsistency tests between FeatureDB and standard ECG machines and different\nclinician assessments, more than 90% of the data fell within the 95% limits of\nagreement. Reliable parameter calculation enhances the potential for arrhythmia\ndetection. In this study, FeatureDB achieved ROAUC values of 0.836 and 0.861 for\nLQT and AVBI arrhythmias, respectively, demonstrating that it offers robust support\nfor the early clinical identification of these conditions. This suggests that the\nevaluation results of FeatureDB and standard ECG machines or clinician assessments\nare consistent, enhancing the potential of wearable devices for routine cardiovascular\nmonitoring in out-of-hospital settings. It also demonstrates the feasibility of using\nwearable devices in non-critical care scenarios.\nIn clinical practice, there is limited validation of the reliability of wearable\ndevices, and existing studies predominantly compare wearable devices with the\nassessment results of standard ECG machines, lacking comparisons withclinician\nassessments[20,21]. In this study, while comparing with standard ECG machines, we for\nthe first time compared FeatureDB with the parameter assessments of multiple\nclinicians, thereby validating the accuracy of FeatureDB in calculating ECG parameters\nfrom different perspectives. Additionally, large sample studies were used in all three\ncomparative analyses, ensuring the reliability of the research[22,23]. More importantly,\nthe consistency of ECG parameters calculated by FeatureDB with the results\ndemonstrated in previous studies. In the comparison between FeatureDB and ECG\nmachines, although the correlation coefficients for some PR intervals, QT intervals,\nand QTc intervals were slightly lower than those of the Apple Watch (AW) and the\nAliveCor Kardia Mobile (KM) device, FeatureDB showed a higher proportion of\nagreement than AW and KM[24,25]. Since the data sample size used in the comparison\nbetween FeatureDB and ECG machines is large and covers a relatively broad\npopulation, whereas AW and KM cover a relatively narrow population, the\ncomparability is relatively poor. Future studies should be conducted under the same\nconditions to enhance the comparability of these results. In the comparisons between\nFeatureDB and clinician assessments from the CSE dataset as well as Doctor A's and\nDoctor B's assessments from the HeartVoice-ECG-lite dataset, the correlation\ncoefficients for PR intervals, QT intervals, and QTc intervals were similar to those of\nAW and KM. At the same time, in the consistency tests between FeatureDB and\nstandard ECG machines and different clinician assessments, most data fell within the\n95% limits of agreement., which is higher than that of AW and KM. This study also\ncompared the assessment results of Doctor A and Doctor B, showing good correlation,\nwhich indirectly indicates that FeatureDB has acceptable reliability in calculating ECG\nparameters.\nAbnormal cardiac rhythms are inevitably accompanied by abnormalities in ECG\nwaveforms[26]. For example, LQT syndrome is characterized by prolonged QT intervals\nand abnormal Twaves[27]. Therefore, the accuracy of ECG waveform detection by\nalgorithms based on wearable devices is crucial for identifying cardiac rhythm\nabnormalities. In this study, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of detecting LQT\nin the comparison between FeatureDB and ECG machines were acceptable (Figure 3A).\nFrom the correlation comparison results between FeatureDB and ECG machines under\ndifferent disease conditions, the correlations of various parameters showed relatively\nsignificant differences across different rhythms and disease states. The PR interval and\nQT interval exhibited overall high correlations, the QTc interval showed moderate\ncorrelation, while the QRS interval had lower correlation, particularly in cases of rapid\nor pathological arrhythmias (Table S1). However, these calculation errors are not\nentirely negative; in some cases, they can serve as clues for \"abnormality\" alerts. By\ncombining trends in ECG parameter changes over different time periods, these errors\nmay reveal potential fluctuations or sudden abnormalities in cardiac health status,\nthereby providing references for early intervention (Table S1). For instance, significant\nchanges in the QT interval or abnormal prolongation of the PR interval during\nlong-term monitoring may indicate potential electrolyte imbalances or conduction\nabnormalities.\nThe PR interval represents the time between the onset of atrial depolarization and\nventricular activation, serving as a crucial indicator in diagnosing atrioventricular\nconduction abnormalities[28]. Prolongation of the PR interval is closely linked to AVBI,\nwhich increases the risk of arrhythmias and other complications[ 29,30]. Clinically, a\nprolonged PR interval may signal an underlying conduction delay that can predispose\npatients to significant cardiovascular events, including syncope or even sudden cardiac\ndeath in severe cases. Traditionally, standard ECG machines have effectively\ndistinguished between non-AVBI and AVBI patients using a 200 ms PR interval\nthreshold, a benchmark grounded in extensive clinical experience (Figure 1D).\nHowever, when evaluating the PR intervals calculated by FeatureDB, the values appear\nless aligned with these traditional expectations, suggesting a potential discrepancy in\nmeasurement accuracy. Despite this, an analysis of FeatureDB's own distribution\nindicates that a 150 ms threshold may be more appropriate for categorizing AVBI\nversus non-AVBI patients (Figure 1D). This adjustment emphasizes the need to tailor\nnew computational methodologies to align with clinically relevant markers, ensuring\nthat these innovative tools remain both sensitive and specific in risk stratification.\nDespite the divergence in numerical thresholds between FeatureDB and standard ECG\nmachines, our large-scale sample analysis demonstrates that FeatureDB can still\nreliably differentiate AVBI patients from non-AVBI patients. The observed shift in\nthreshold does not detract from its overall diagnostic performance; rather, it reflects\nthe intrinsic differences in algorithmic processing that can be optimized with extensive\ndatasets. This finding highlights the power of large-scale, real-world validation studies\nin refining and calibrating AI-based diagnostic tools, ultimately supporting their\nintegration into clinical practice for effective and timely cardiovascular risk assessment.\nSignal quality is crucial for obtaining accurate analysis results, and ECG signals\nwith poor quality are unreliable. Poor signal quality is often associated with noise\ninterference. For acquired ECG signals, filtering is necessary before signal analysis, or\nlow-quality signals that cannot be repaired should be discarded[31,32]. In this study, we\nincluded ECG samples with signal quality scores above 0.5. In the comparison\nbetween FeatureDB and ECG machines, we examined the correlation coefficients of\nPR intervals, QRS durations, QT intervals, and QTc intervals across different signal\nquality ranges. The results showed that higher ECG signal quality corresponded to\nhigher correlation coefficients for PR intervals, QRS durations, QT intervals, and QTc\nintervals, indicating greater reliability of FeatureDB's calculations (Figure S1). In data\nwith poor signal quality (signal quality scores of 0.5 to 0.6), due to significant\nwaveform variations, the parameters calculated by the algorithm had lower correlations\nwith the reference values (Figure S1). This may be the main reason for the larger\ndeviations between the algorithm-calculated parameters and the reference values. In\ndata with high signal quality (signal quality scores of 0.9 to 1.0), the waveforms were\nclear and stable, and the parameters calculated by the algorithm were highly correlated\nwith the reference values, verifying the reliability of the algorithm under high-quality\nsignal conditions (Figure S1). This demonstrates that signal quality significantly\nimpacts computational performance and annotation consistency, necessitating further\noptimization of low-quality signal processing capabilities. Therefore, it is essential to\nenhance signal quality control when using wearable devices for ECG analysis to\nminimize the impact of signal quality on the results.\nQRS duration is an important ECG parameter, and its detection involves R-peak,\nQ-wave, and S-wave detection[33,34]. In this study, the correlation coefficients for QRS\nduration in the comparative analysis between FeatureDB and standard ECG machines\nas well as different clinician assessments were generally low. The presence of noise"}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "The comprehensive results indicate that FeatureDB exhibits a high level of agreement\nwith both standard ECG machines and clinician assessments.

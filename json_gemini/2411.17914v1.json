INTRODUCTION", "content": "Project performance forecasting is a critical aspect of project\nmanagement, particularly in the construction industry, where\nprojects are often complex, dynamic, and influenced by various\ninternal and external factors.\nAccurate forecasting of project performance metrics, such as\ncost variance, schedule variance, and earned value, enables\nproject managers to proactively identify potential issues and\ntake corrective actions to keep the project on track [1].\nHowever, traditional forecasting methods often rely on static\nbaseline plans and fail to consider project progress's dynamic\nnature and impact from external factors.\nMachine learning techniques have shown promising results\nin various domains, including project management, by\nleveraging historical data and identifying patterns and\nrelationships that can be used for predictive purposes [2]. In the\ncontext of project performance forecasting, machine learning\nalgorithms can be employed to develop predictive models that\nconsider historical project data, current progress, and external\nfactors to generate accurate forecasts [3]. This study aims to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning-\nbasedforecasting models in comparison to traditional methods\nand highlight the potential benefits of incorporating external\nfactors, including resource availability and weather conditions,\ninto the forecasting process.\nThe case study focuses on an urban road reconstruction\nproject, typically involving multiple Work Breakdown\nStructure (WBS) categories, such as surveying, earthworks,\npaving, drainage, and road furniture. The research proposes the\ndevelopment of a machine learning-based forecasting model\nthat utilizes time series forecasting techniques, such as\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict project\nperformance metrics for each WBS category.

LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Project performance forecasting has been the subject of\nextensive research in the field of project management.\nTraditional forecasting methods, such as earned value\nmanagement (EVM), have been widely used to monitor and\ncontrol project performance. EVM compares the planned value\n(PV) of work with the earned value (EV) and actual cost (AC)\nto determine project performance indicators, such as cost\nvariance (CV) and schedule variance (SV) [6]. However, EVM\nrelies on static baseline plans and does not account for the\ndynamic nature of project progress or the impact of external\nfactors [7].\nMachine learning techniques have been increasingly applied\nin project management to improve various aspects, including\ncost estimation, risk assessment, and resource optimization [8],\n[9]. In the context of project performance forecasting, machine\nlearning algorithms have shown promising results in predicting\nproject outcomes based on historical data and project\ncharacteristics [1], [2].\nFurthermore, time series forecasting techniques, such as\nARIMA and LSTM networks, have been successfully applied\nin various domains to predict future values based on historical\npatterns [10]. ARIMA models are widely used for time series\nforecasting and can capture linear relationships in the data [11].\nLSTM networks, which are a type of recurrent neural network,\nhave been shown to be effective in capturing long-term\ndependencies and handling complex patterns in time series data\n[12].\nThe incorporation of external factors, such as weather\npatterns, and resource availability, into project performance\nforecasting models has been explored in previous studies [e.g.\n13]. These factors can have a significant impact on project\nperformance and including them in the forecasting process can\npotentially improve the accuracy of the predictions [14], [15].\nDespite the growing interest in machine learning applications\nin project management, there is limited research on the\napplication of machine learning techniques for project\nperformance forecasting in the context of urban road\nreconstruction projects. This research aims to address this gap\nby presenting a case study on the development and evaluation\nof a machine learning-based forecasting model for an urban\nroad reconstruction project."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The dataset used in this study was obtained from the\nhistorical records of an urban road reconstruction project\nprovided by a civil construction company [16]. The historical\nproject data was collected for the period from January 2011 to\nOctober 2012, including detailed cost, and earned value\ninformation. Due to the unavailability of external data on\nresource availability and weather conditions in the original\ndataset, these factors were simulated based on reasonable\nassumptions to demonstrate the potential impact of external\nfactors on project performance forecasting. The data\npreprocessing steps, including handling missing values,\noutliers, and inconsistencies, as well as data normalization,\nwere applied to ensure the data's suitability for machine\nlearning algorithms. Table I presents the summary statistics of\nthe key project performance metrics and external factors used\nin the study, providing insights into the range and distribution\nof the data.\nIn addition to the previously engineered features, such as\nrolling averages of cost variance, simulated weather patterns,\nand resource availability, new features were created to provide\na more comprehensive representation of the project's\nperformance and enable the machine learning models to\nleverage the information effectively. These features focus on\ncapturing the relationships between cost variance, earned value,\nand simulated external factors. Table 2 shows the correlation\nanalysis of the project performance metrics and external factors,\nhighlighting the relationships between the variables and their\npotential impact on forecasting models. The analysis revealed\nsignificant correlations between cost variance, earned value,\nand the simulated external factors, indicating the importance of\nconsidering these factors in the forecasting process."}, {"title": "B. Model Development", "content": "Along with the ARIMA model, a Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) neural network was implemented and trained for time\nseries forecasting. The LSTM model was chosen due to its\nability to capture long-term dependencies and handle complex\npatterns in time series data. The architecture of the LSTM\nmodel was designed to include multiple layers, with the number\nof neurons and layers determined through experimentation and\nhyperparameter tuning.\nThe LSTM model was trained using the historical project\ndata, with a portion of the data used for validation to monitor\nthe model's performance during training. The training process\ninvolved optimizing the model's weights and biases to minimize\nthe prediction error using appropriate loss functions and\noptimization algorithms."}, {"title": "C. Model Evaluation", "content": "The performance of the ARIMA and LSTM models was\nevaluated and compared using various evaluation metrics,\nincluding Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error\n(MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics\nprovide a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy in\npredicting project performance metrics, such as cost variance\nand earned value. Table 2 shows the correlation analysis of\nproject performance metrics and external factors.\nTo ensure the robustness and generalization ability of the\nforecasting models, cross-validation techniques were applied.\nSpecifically, k-fold cross-validation was used, where the data\nwas divided into k subsets, and the models were trained and\nevaluated k times, each time using a different subset as the\nvalidation set. This approach helped to assess the models'\nperformance across different subsets of the data and provided a\nmore reliable estimate of their predictive capabilities."}, {"title": "D.

These\nvisualizations aim to provide a clear and informative\nrepresentation of the project's performance, highlighting key\npatterns, trends, and relationships among the various metrics. In\naddition, the impact of external factors, such as simulated\nweather patterns and resource availability, on project\nperformance was analyzed.

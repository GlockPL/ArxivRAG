Contemporary approaches often transform languages into computational arti-\nfacts, critically separating them from their rich cultural contexts and community knowledge systems\n[Munk et al., 2022].

Contemporary technological approaches, despite their compu-\ntational power, often reduce this rich, nuanced reality to simplified computational representations\n[Munk et al., 2022]. This reductive approach presents significant challenges for preserving the intri-\ncate richness of human linguistic expression and cultural transmission systems.\nAnthropological linguistics and cognitive science research emphasizes language's profound role\nin shaping human experience across multiple dimensions [Suchman, 2006]. Language simultaneously\nfunctions as a biological capacity, cognitive system, social practice, and cultural repository. Existing\ntechnological approaches predominantly focus on surface-level patterns and statistical regularities,\npotentially overlooking deeper linguistic phenomena.\nThe standardization of language processing through foundation models, while technically effi-\ncient, risks oversimplifying this inherent complexity. Current approaches may inadvertently promote\nlinguistic homogenization by prioritizing computational efficiency over cultural and social dimen-\nsions. This technological standardization impacts not only language processing but fundamentally\nshapes how communities interact with and transmit their linguistic heritage.\nThe challenges extend beyond mere technical considerations. [Crawford, 2021] reveals how cur-\nrent approaches can disconnect languages from their ecological contexts-the intricate web of social\npractices, cultural knowledge, and community relationships that imbue language with meaning and\nvitality. This disconnection particularly impacts communities whose linguistic practices are deeply\nintertwined with traditional knowledge systems and cultural practices [Ajani et al., 2024].\nRecent studies highlight specific risks in technological simplification. [Noble, 2018] demonstrates\nhow algorithmic approaches can inadvertently reinforce existing power structures and cultural bi-\nases. The emphasis on data-driven methodologies poses particular challenges in understanding and\npreserving subtle cultural and contextual language use dimensions [Hutchinson et al., 2021].

However, this technological progress masks a fundamental tension between computational\nadvancement and linguistic diversity preservation. A significant portion of the world's linguistic\ncommunities remains underserved or entirely excluded from these developments [Bird, 2020, 2022],\nreflecting deeper systemic challenges in our approach to language technology development.\nThe emergence of foundation models represents a critical juncture in the evolution of language\ntechnologies. As Bommasani et al. note:\n\"Foundation models have led to an unprecedented level of homogenization: Almost all state-\nof-the-art NLP models are now adapted from one of a few foundation models [...] While\nthis homogenization produces extremely high leverage (any improvements in the foundation\nmodels can lead to immediate benefits across all of NLP), it is also a liability [...] We are\nalso beginning to see a homogenization across research communities.\" [Bommasani et al.,\n2021, p. 5].\nThis homogenization presents a paradox: while it enables rapid technological advancement\nthrough standardized approaches, it simultaneously threatens linguistic and cultural diversity by\nimposing uniform computational paradigms across fundamentally different linguistic and cultural\ncontexts. The current paradigm in language technology development, predominantly shaped by this\nhomogenizing computational perspective, prioritizes processing efficiency and algorithmic optimiza-\ntion over cultural preservation.\nThree critical risks emerge from this trajectory:\nFirst, the transformation of languages into computational artifacts risks divorcing them from\ntheir cultural contexts and community knowledge systems. This separation undermines the\nessence of language as a medium for cultural transmission and meaning-making [Munk et al.,\n2022].\nSecond, the prevalent approach of representing meaning through vector embeddings in high-\ndimensional spaces, while mathematically elegant and computationally efficient, reduces the\nrich complexity of semantic understanding to purely statistical correlations.\nThird, and perhaps most critically, the homogenization of language technology development\nthrough foundation models creates a single point of failure for cultural and linguistic preser-\nvation, potentially embedding and amplifying existing biases and power structures across all\napplications [Bender et al., 2021].\nThe urgency of addressing these challenges is amplified by the rapid digitalization of global\ncommunication. While technological advancement through foundation models is inevitable and\npotentially beneficial, its current trajectory threatens to marginalize traditional knowledge systems\nand cultural practices that have sustained linguistic communities for generations. This tension\nbetween technological progress and cultural preservation necessitates a fundamental reimagining of\nhow we approach language technology development."}, {"title": "AI Thinking: A Conceptual Framework", "content": "AI Thinking represents a systematic approach to leveraging the methodological insights gained from\ndecades of artificial intelligence research to enhance human cognitive processes and improve tech-\nnology development.

The framework emphasizes how communities construct, validate, and transmit\nknowledge through complex interactions that transcend simple information exchange [Riedl, 2019,\nMarcus and Davis, 2020, Miller and Suchman, 2022].\nThe relationship between culture and cognition forms a central axis in AI Thinking.

Instead, we propose implementing\nwhat [Sapignoli, 2021] describes as \"deep participation\" a process where communities would ac-\ntively shape not just the features of technological tools but the fundamental paradigms through\nwhich these tools operate. This approach would manifest through three interconnected methodolog-\nical components:\nKnowledge Integration Frameworks would serve as the primary mechanism for synthesizing com-\nmunity wisdom with technological capabilities. These frameworks would implement systematic ap-\nproaches for documenting and preserving cultural knowledge while adapting technological solutions\nto community needs. The process would begin with comprehensive cultural-linguistic documenta-\ntion, conducted through methods that respect and preserve the complex ways in which communities\nconstruct and transmit meaning. This documentation would extend beyond traditional linguistic\nannotation to capture what [Suchman, 2006] terms the \"situated nature of meaning\" - the complex\nweb of cultural associations and practices through which language acquires significance.\nThe development process would follow what we term \"meaning-centered iterative cycles,\" de-\nsigned to extend traditional agile methodologies to incorporate cultural validation and meaning\npreservation at each stage. These cycles would implement specific protocols for ensuring that tech-\nnological development aligns with community needs and cultural practices:\n1. Cultural Context Analysis: Systematic documentation of meaning-making processes within the\ncommunity, including both explicit linguistic practices and implicit cultural knowledge.\n2. Technical Component Design: Development of technological solutions explicitly designed to\npreserve and enhance documented meaning-making processes.\n3. Community Validation: Structured processes for community evaluation and refinement of tech-\nnological components, focusing on meaning preservation and cultural authenticity.\n4.

The transition from 4G to 5G has substantial implications for AI in consolidating a network predominantly geared towards business verticals. In this context, 3GPP has specified and introduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) entity at the network's core to provide insights based on AI algorithms to benefit network orchestration. This paper proposes a framework for evolving NWDAF that presents the interfaces necessary to further empower the core network with Al capabilities B5G and 6G. In addition, we identify a set of research directions for realizing a distributed e-NWDAF.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "To support different industry verticals, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), Smart Factory, or Self Driving, many challenges and stringent requirements have been imposed on the standardization and development processes of 5G mobile networks [Coronado et al. 2022]. In particular, numerous advances have been made in the control plane of this network, such as network slicing [Moreira and Silva 2021], beam-forming [Brilhante et al. 2023], closed-loop automation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and security enforcement [Silva et al. 2023] to support improved connectivity and chaining of virtualized network functions.\nDifferent AI techniques were applied to the core of the 5G network, aiming for efficient resource management and the delivery of connectivity to application vertices. Some disruptive techniques are built apart from the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specifications, while others are aligned with 3GPP, which is the case of the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) entity idealized in Release 15 [3GPP 2023].\nThe role of NWDAF is to collect information from various network functions (NFs)"}, {"title": "2. Related Work", "content": "This section provides a comparative review of state-of-the-art solutions that relate to both aspects of our proposal. The first refers to generic architectures for delivering cognitive services, while the other specifies approaches that target advancements in the core of the B5G network to enable AI verticals."}, {"title": "2.1. Generic AI Architectures", "content": "[Shah et al. 2022] proposed incorporating AlaaS, Service as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to curb the spread of unethical content on social media platforms. They proposed using AlaaS to identify and remove such content, which was classified into immoral, cyberbullying, and dislike categories. The authors employed traditional supervised learning algorithms but did not evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques despite claiming that their approach is suitable for large datasets.\n[Fortuna et al. 2023] investigated the potential benefits of using on-premise AlaaS solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. The study evaluated the capabilities of AlaaS and explored the feasibility of implementing it using open-source, user-friendly technologies. These technologies allow businesses to control their data, processes, and costs while minimizing reliance on third-party vendors or vendor lock-in risks.\n[Guntupalli and Rudramalla 2023] introduced a method to guarantee data compression, integrity, and confidentiality in AIaaS deployments, which are online repositories that provide various Machine Learning (ML) services and tools to users. However,"}, {"title": "2.2. B5G-Enabled AI Architectures", "content": "[Li et al. 2021] proposed a cognitive service architecture for the 6G core network, inspired by the nervous system of an octopus, to enhance network performance and meet high service quality requirements. The cognitive service architecture aims to provide real-time perception, AI reasoning abilities, and a knowledge graph management system to adjust the core network dynamically. A case study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the cognitive service architecture, demonstrating significant time savings in session establishment compared to noncognitive service architecture.\n[Manias et al. 2022] developed a functional prototype of NWDAF within a 5GC network, using unsupervised learning and clustering techniques to analyze intra-network interactions and optimize operations. The innovation lies in creating a working prototype for the 5GC network and NWDAF, enabling practical data-driven techniques and offering insights for future research and network management."}, {"title": "3. Proposed Core Enhancement", "content": "This paper proposes a background for NWDAF enhancement Beyond 5G or 6G networks. The fundamental idea behind this enhancement is to extend the functions that 3GPP already designed in Release 18 for NWDAF from two perspectives. The first perspective is to allow the network to benefit from AI capabilities in a more sophisticated manner, with the operation being of the AI for Networking (AI4Net) type. The second perspective is the return to enabling AI functions for third parties through mobile networks, the operation being of the Networking for AI (Net4AI) type.\nThe current standardization of NWDAF provides analytics functions for mobile networks through a set of messages for data collection, reporting, subscription, and exposure of core entity metrics. NWDAF allows for updating the pipeline with new analytics types, algorithms, or models and integrating them into operations. However, the NWDAF standardization model is managed solely by network operators, hindering third-party innovation in delivering cognitive services. To address this, we propose combining and evolving NWDAF with AIaaS and NetApp concepts, currently in development, to specify how third-party services can be integrated and specified within the network framework.\nAlaaS refers to an architectural framework for lifecycle management and delivery of AI services that aims to seamlessly deploy and embed intelligence capabilities to applications or edge devices [Rodrigues Moreira et al. 2023]. In line with European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the concept of NetApps was created, which is a 5G-enabled virtual application, and an evolution of the concept of Virtualized Network Function (VNF), which provides functionalities to deliver complex services [Slamnik-Krije\u0161torac et al. 2022]. Thus, in Figure 1, we present the intervention proposed in this paper, which we call evolved NWDAF (e-NWDAF).\nIn Figure 1, we position the main elements of the 5G core, and on the left, we highlight e-NWDAF with its additional functions: AI4Net and Net4AI. In our e-NWDAF, we"}, {"title": "4. Research Directions", "content": "Towards distributed NWDAF boosted by AI, we conducted a short state-of-the-art analysis on the three main indexing databases, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), ScienceDirect, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, using the search string as below. The word combination provides a focused yet comprehensive approach to research, bridging network data analytics with advanced distributed learning techniques. This intersection aims brings practical challenges in data analysis and offers theoretical grounds to evolve AI service composition."}, {"title": "5. Concluding Remarks", "content": "The present paper offers an evolutionary proposal for the NWDAF system, which adopts a distributed architecture and employs AI-Agents to interface with the various core functions of the mobile network. We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the core functions, identifying the aspects that are most suitable for enhancement following the specifications outlined by 3GPP. While NWDAF in its original form represents a significant step forward in the field, it can be further refined to enable a broader range of benefits, particularly in cognitive service delivery.\nWe designed interfaces that enable third parties to receive cognitive services through Net4AI and expanded the fundamental principles of NWDAF to encompass third-party cognitive services in the context of AI4Net. We identified research directions that focused on creating and verifying e-NWDAF architectures for B5G deployment. One of the limitations of this paper is the need for empirical validation of theoretical concepts. In future work, we plan to address this limitation by presenting validation and benchmark results."}]}

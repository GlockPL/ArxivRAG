{"title": "THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM OF BELIEFS: DOES EVOLUTION FAVOUR AI OVER HUMANS?", "authors": ["David M. Bossens", "Shanshan Feng", "Yew-Soon Ong"], "abstract": "As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety concerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or impact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for controlled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated social networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their messaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal Darwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs through dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through cognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract implementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging, evolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to 95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs designed for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme beliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels; c) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda effectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g. legislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "As AI systems generate more and more content on digital platforms, they have a rapid influence on a global scale, including fake news and deceptive messaging, but also unintended consequences of truthful messaging. As AIs and humans live together in this digital ecosystem, the evolution of such complex systems is poorly understood, and therefore the natural question is whether AI in this context can be controlled [1] and whether evolution will ultimately favour AI [2]. As AIs increasingly operate in social networks, one may wonder to what extent AI can in some sense dominate in this sphere. Recent work has raised concerns about how generative AI may lead to a variety of negative outcomes on social networks. In particular, as Large Language Models (LLMs) and other generative models can produce a high quality and high quantity of misleading and biased data (e.g. deep fakes), there are concerns that these tools will be used for propaganda, i.e. to spread information that influences the beliefs of people [3-5]. Similarly, the way that content or media channels are recommended is also a key concern, as through recommending channels with the same opinions, these often lead to a positive feedback loop where pre-existing beliefs are reinforced rather than dispelled [6, 7]. Moreover, the sheer quantity of data is also of concern as most of data may soon be AI-generated [8]. Unfortunately, understanding the joint evolution of humans and AIs remains a grand challenge [9], especially within large social networks.\nModelling the evolution of social networks is typically done using concepts from social network science and cognitive science. While there are a variety of approaches using data sets to analyse social networks (e.g. [10, 11]), this approach has limitations since: a) there is currently no data about the joint evolution of AI and humans in social networks; and b) real world data does not allow for controlled experiments where one systematically varies some variables and keeps other variables constant. Instead, it is possible to perform simulations to study the outcomes. In this line of work, contagion models aim to model the spread of news, or other types of messaging, in terms of a set of first sharers who formulate the initial content, with dynamics formulated such that each time step neighbouring nodes in the social network update their beliefs if it is close to their beliefs [11\u201314], in which case it may be shared again in what is called a \"cascade\" [12]. While such models offer the flexibility of modelling the cognitive transitions of heterogeneous sets of agents, existing studies do not consider the intelligence and adaptivity of the agents acting in such systems. In agent-based simulations, one performs large-scale multi-agent simulation studies where agents are based on learned or hand-designed decision rules [15-17].\nThe above techniques are relatively simplistic in the sense that once the simulation is running, the agents do not modify their own messaging strategies and the social network structure is fixed, and there are no evolutionary operators across large time scales. While one may argue that such features are not necessary since evolution operates on DNA across vast time scales, it can be equally argued, within the universal Darwinism framework [18], that Darwinian evolution acts on a wide range of phenomena and on different time scales. Cultural and memetic evolution (e.g. [19]), where content, ideas, and beliefs are transmitted and modified across generations, are particularly important instances of universal Darwinism in this context.\nA question hitherto unexplored is how such cultural forms of Darwinism may behave in the context of human-AI interactions, and how this may lead to AI dominance in social networks. Inspired by the dynamics in content sharing platforms such as Youtube, Facebook, and X (formerly Twitter), this paper will focus on the interplay between the evolution of content-generating policies, the \"views\" of those forms of content, and how this content changes the beliefs of the agents in such a social network. In this context, the AI dominance is then defined in terms of the proportion of views and the success of propagating beliefs to humans. With the above scenario in mind, this paper presents the following contributions:\n\u2022 The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico) framework, which\nmodels agents as policies aiming to maximise the cumulative reward by broadcasting content to each other, where communication links are based on influence and distance measures;\nevolves agents' policies through evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and adapts their beliefs through an extension of the generalised cognitive cascade model of Rabb et al. [12]; and\nallows the study of how problem variables (e.g. messaging rate, evolutionary rate, belief constraints, etc.) affect important outcomes related to AI dominance, extreme beliefs, and harmful outcomes in the wider ecosystem.\n\u2022 An empirical study within Digico, in which agents are evolved based on CMA-ES [20] and are defined as AIs or humans depending on their key characteristics. Inspired by online video platforms, the study identifies key risk factors for AI dominance in terms of the number of views and the effectiveness of propaganda. In particular, we find that\nwhen AIs have increased influence, more frequent messaging, and faster evolution, they can receive up to 95% of the views;\ntargeted propaganda by AIs may lead to half of the humans adopting the same extreme belief; and\nthe larger the number of agents that are used for belief updates, the more even the spread of beliefs and the less effective propaganda.\n\u2022 Based on these findings, we also formulate advice for avoiding these extreme cases."}, {"title": "2 The Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs", "content": "The proposed framework, called the Digital Ecosystem of Beliefs (or Digico for short), provides formalisms for modelling interactions between humans and AIs through messages that influence each others' beliefs.

In each generation, a population of $N$ agents interacts with each other by taking actions (i.e. sending messages) and observing each other's messages with probabilities determined by the niche geometry, the influence matrix, and potentially other aspects of the ecosystem (see Sec 2.2 for their definitions). Following the actions, the ecosystem performs a step which allows physical events to unfold (e.g. in a realistic simulator) in response to the digital content. Then the agents are each given a reward, for instance, depending on the popularity (e.g. the number of times the message was observed by others) and the belief (e.g. whether the message sent reflects the sender's beliefs). The belief weight matrix $W$ is then updated and the belief process"}, {"title": "2.2 Ecosystem formalism", "content": "The ecosystem is composed of a set of interacting agents, which are referred to as the population $P = \\{Agent_1,..., Agent_N\\}$, and various entities with which they interact. A subset of the population, for simplicity set at the first indices $Agent_1,..., Agent_{N'}$, defines one group of agents (e.g. AIs) whereas the remaining set $Agent_{N'+1},..., Agent_N$ defines the other group of agents (e.g. humans). Groups of agents have different properties, in terms of how they act, observe, how their beliefs change, their geographical location, etc. The various capabilities of agents and the ways they interact with the environment are defined by the following properties:\n\u2022 Sending capacity or action space (A): the number of messages the individual can send simultaneously, the type of content, and across which channels.\n\u2022 Receiving capacity or observation probability ($\\Omega$): the capability of receiving messages in terms of quantity, type of content, and across which channels. It is a function of the form $\\Omega : A^N \\rightarrow \\Delta(O)$ that in addition to the actions (i.e. messages) of different agents may depend on the influence matrix $I$, the observation capacity $N_\\Omega(i)$, and potentially other variables (e.g. the niche or variables hidden in the ecosystem step). Noting that each agent $i = 1,..., N$ has a register to store the message of each of the other agents $j \\neq i$, the notation $\\Omega_{i,j}$ will refer specifically to the probability of agent $i$ observing the message of agent $j$ at register $j$.\n\u2022 Influence matrix (Z): for each ordered pair of individuals (i, j) there is a scalar influence factor $Z_{ij}$, defining to which extent individual i has an influence benefit over individual j, such that - $Z_{ij}$ indicates how much agent j influences agent i. The structure is used in the observation probability and potentially other purposes (e.g. in the fitness function).\n\u2022 Messaging and observation rate: the rate at which the agent can observe and act.\n\u2022 Messaging strategy or policy (\u03c0): the strategy for broadcasting messages limited by the sending capacities. It is a function of the form $\\pi : O \\rightarrow \\Delta(A)$ that determines the content of messages to send based on incoming observations. Two groups of agents may for instance differ in terms of the parametrisation $O$, which determines the class of feasible genotypes and the function class of $\\pi$. In our experiments, the policy is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), while in future work recurrent policies or even large language models (LLMs) may be explored.\n\u2022 Beliefs b: a belief is a vector of real values representing for each dimension $b_k k = 1,..., D$ a specific quantity associated with a particular hypothesis. While this sounds restrictive, it can express a wide range of controversial issues (e.g. boolean or float values related to scientific hypotheses, performance comparisons between social groups, illegal money expenditure, and resource availability)."}, {"title": "2.3 The belief process", "content": "The belief process of Digico is based on a contagion model, in which the probability of the belief of an agent at time $t + 1$ depends on the distance of the beliefs of agents at time $t$. The contagion model follows to a large extent the generalised cognitive contagion model as formulated in Rabb et al. (Eq. 3 in [12]),\n$P(b_i(t + 1) = b_j|b_i(t)) = \\beta(b_i(t), b_j), \\qquad$ (1)\nwhere $\\beta$ is a function relating to similarity or logical relations and j is a node neighbouring to i. However, the belief process differs from Eq. 1in the following ways. First, in contrast to the institutional cascade considered by Rabb et al., Digico does not make use of a central messenger (the so-called \u201cinstitution\") that sends one message at each time step, but instead allows all the agents to message each other (albeit possibly at varying rates). Second, Digico takes a fully connected graph, such that all agents are neighbours but with varying probabilities. To this end, Digico introduces a belief weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$, which determines for each ordered pair of agents $(i, j) \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}^2$ the belief weight given to a particular agent j in computing the belief update for a particular agent i. Third, another difference is that each agent $i = 1, . . ., N$ may observe multiple messages at the same time based on their observation capacity $N_\\Omega(i)$. Therefore, the process takes into account the beliefs coming from all the observed agents' messages. Fourth, while we do not implement this function in the experiments, we generalise the model to be based on inferring beliefs from the observations (since a message in general may be interpreted by different agents as broadcasting a different belief). With these properties in mind, the belief process of Digico takes the form of an individual level Markov chain\n$P(b_i(t + 1) = b | b_i(t)) = exp (C_b I((\\phi_j(o_j(t))) = b) * W_{ij}/||b - b_i(t)||),\\qquad$ (2)\n$j \\in J$\nwhere $J$ is the set of indices such that $o_j(t)$ is a received message for all $j \\in J$, $I$ is the indicator function, the norm indicates the Euclidian distance, $\\phi_i(o_j(t))$ indicates the belief that agent $i$ infers agent $j$ to have based on the observation of $o_j(t)$, and a belief factor $C_b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ controls the form of the distribution. Due to the properties of exponentials, Eq. 2 can be interpreted as applying a single contagion step for each of the agents from which a message was received. In our experiments, $\\phi_i$ is the identity mapping, i.e. $\\phi_i(o_j(t)) = o_j(t)$. More generally, when agent $j$ broadcasts a message and this is observed by agent $i$, agent $i$ infers a particular belief $\\phi_i(o_j(t))$; this inferred belief is usually similar but not equal to $b_j$, the true belief of agent $j$.\nThe belief weight matrix is subject to changes determined by a function h of the observation of the agent, its prior belief, the beliefs of the other individuals, the fitness of both individuals, the influence matrix, and the number of updates so far:\n$\\Delta W_{ij} = h(o_i(t)|b_i, b_j, r_i, r_j, I_{ij}, t). \\qquad$ (3)\nThe belief weight matrix can be interpreted as a graph with many concepts from network science being applicable. While the resulting graph is fully connected, it can be sparsified by removing low-weight connections or by putting any low-probability belief updates in Eq. 2 to zero. A few example update rules for Eq. 3 are random walks, drifts with randomness, reward-based updates which increase the weight of high-performing agents, and adaptive gradient techniques.\nThe influence matrix $I$ on the other hand can control whether or not the agent receives messages at all by its impact on the observation probability. For instance, if agents 1, . . ., N send exactly one message at time t, and messages"}, {"title": "2.4 Evolutionary dynamics", "content": "Distinct from the belief process, Digico also includes evolutionary dynamics that directly act on the policies (i.e. messaging strategies) of individuals in the population. Following Universal Darwinism, the process of natural selection can and has been applied to phenomena that extend much beyond biological evolution. In Digico, the messaging strategy, or policy \u03c0, contains inheritable traits that are parametrised by the genotype \u03b8. Messaging strategies that are more fit will survive to continue into the next generation. For instance, when the fitness function is related to popularity, unpopular messaging (e.g. with low views, likes, or shares), will have low representation in the population. Such strategies, and the underlying beliefs they represent, will therefore be lost eventually, while popular messaging strategies and beliefs will become more prevalent. This subsection provides more details on the fitness evaluation and evolutionary operators.\nEvaluation As shown in Algorithm 1, each fitness evaluation takes T time steps. At each time step, the following operations are repeated. Each agent $i \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$ performs an action according to its policy, $m_i \\sim \\pi(\\cdot|\\theta_i)$, which broadcasts a message to the ecosystem. Consequently, each agent $i \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}$ observes $N_\\Omega(i)$ messages from other agents randomly sampled without replacement, according to its observation distribution $o_i \\sim \\Omega_i(m_j|Z_i, \\Omega, E)$ and observation capacity $N_\\Omega(i)$, which are partial observations of the full environment state as determined by the influence matrix, the niche, and possibly other variables in the ecosystem. Following the observation, each individual receives a reward, which in general depends on the ecosystem at large. After all T time steps have been performed, the fitness is computed for each agent as the sum of rewards. The ecosystem maintains state across evaluations.\nA simple and relevant example of the fitness is the number of views, i.e. for each agent i one counts how many times its message is included in the observations of other agents $j \\neq i$. One may additionally add a belief violation penalty, which constrains the messaging to be similar to the true belief of agents. With these two components in mind, the reward of agent i at time t is given by\n$r_i(t) = (\\sum_{j\\neq i} I(o_i(t) = m_j(t)) ) - \\lambda||b_i(t) - \\phi_i(m_i(t))||, \\qquad$ (5)\nwhere $\\phi_i(o_j(t))$ indicates the belief that agent $i$ infers agent $j$ to have based on $o_j(t)$, i.e. the observation at register $j$ at time $t$, $I$ is the indicator function, and $\\lambda > 0$ reflects the strength of the penalty. Noting that the fitness function is the sum of the rewards, this leads to the fitness function that will be used for the remainder of the paper, and implemented in Eq. 6,\n$f(\\pi_i) = \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} (\\sum_{j\\neq i} I(o_i(t) = m_j(t)) ) - ||b_i(t) - \\phi_i(m_i(t)) || . \\qquad$ (6)\nEvolutionary operators In Digico, the policy is typically a deep neural network, which can be evolved based on real-valued variation and selection operators. In this paper, we select Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES) [20] to evolve the policies. CMA-ES is a popular evolutionary strategies algorithm which maintains a mean genotype and a covariance matrix to efficiently search for new solutions. It assigns larger weight to individuals based on their fitness scores in updating the mean and covariance matrix, and it accounts for the evolution path in covariance matrix and step size updates. These targeted updates make the algorithm more directed than most mutation operators which are comparable to random search. The CMA-ES algorithm is suitable for updates on high-dimensional real-valued genotypes and is therefore a natural choice for evolving the parameter vectors parametrising neural network policies. In particular, we use the sep-CMA-ES variant [23], which avoids eigendecompositions of the covariance matrix by using only diagonals of the covariance matrix for sampling new genotypes. This results in a time complexity that is linear in dimensionality (rather than quadratic), making it suitable for high-dimensional genotypes."}, {"title": "2.5 Characterising a healthy ecosystem", "content": "To highlight the potential of using Digico to study and maintain a healthy ecosystem of beliefs, we review potential outcomes, associated scenarios, and related evolutionary concepts. We note that achieving beneficial outcomes depends crucially on a healthy ecosystem, and that this may be achieved through outside intervention (e.g. legislation) or by designing a suitable control agent, which is put in the population with the aim to maintain a healthy belief ecosystem.\nIn the belief convergence/bottleneck outcome, all the agents converge to the same belief, i.e.\n$\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} P(b_i(t) = b) = 1$\\nfor some belief dimension $b^e$ for all i in the population. While some agreement is the sign of a healthy, cohesive culture, a complete absence of variety leads to dogmatic thinking and reduces innovation. Moreover, some such beliefs may be extreme or harmful beliefs, which leads to concerns of AIs manipulating the wider population.\nOn the opposite side of the belief variety, we may have a healthy population diversity in beliefs, e.g. a Gaussian or uniform distribution.\nYet another alternative, which may be considered as unhealthy population diversity, is that of belief divergence, in which distinct cliques emerge with extremely different beliefs and limited to no between-clique interaction. The label \"unhealthy\" may perhaps be somewhat biased, but in a real world scenario this would correspond to a conflict or segregation of some sort. This may happen in the context of an \u201cepistemic bubble\u201d, where agents simply do not get information from a variety of sources, or an \u201cecho chamber\", where there is additionally some ideological resistance to alternative ideas and facts [7]. Due to the belief violation penalty in Eq. 6, the beliefs and fitness are often intertwined. Moreover, ecological niches may provide some unique circumstances (e.g. due to geographical location, socio-economic class, or even random external events affecting views of particular channels). Consequently, the emergence of highly specialised groups evolving in isolation after a significant event or bottleneck may lead to the so-called founder effect [24, 25], where interbreeding among populations of low genetic diversity will yield new species. In an evolutionary computation sense, such effects correspond to a highly local search leading to highly successful specialised solutions.\nRelated to both of the above, the belief loss/extinction scenario may happen where a true belief is lost forever, i.e.\n$\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} P(b_i(t) = b) = 0$\\nfor some b for all i in the population.\nOur empirical study focuses on a particular type of belief convergence, where one group of agents specifically sets out to convince the entire population to adopt one particular belief. We show that under certain conditions, a very high percentage of the population adopts a particularly extreme belief within a limited number of generations, and many of the beliefs on the other extreme are completely lost. Under other conditions, particularly those where agents communicate widely and learn from many other agents, we find a very wide, and sometimes even uniform distribution.\""}, {"title": "3 Experimental setup", "content": "With the aim of demonstrating Digico as a framework for assessing empirical questions about social networks subject to evolutionary rules, this section describes the implementation of Digico, various parameter settings, as well as the independent and dependent variables of the empirical study which aims at identifying key factors for AI dominance in social networks."}, {"title": "3.1 Implementation", "content": "Beliefs and messages are implemented as integers in {0, 1, . . ., 9} yielding 10 distinct beliefs. Each policy is an MLP with observations of the form o = m1, ..., mN (i.e. received messages), where $N = 30$ is the number of agents, and integer actions (i.e. sent messages). Most observation registers will read -1, indicating that the agent did not attend to this communication channel, while other observation registers will include the message that was sent by the agent at those indices. The number of messages received is equal to the observation capacity, which is 4 for all agents."}, {"title": "3.2 Experiment setting inspired by online video platforms", "content": "The general setting of the experiments is inspired by YouTube, an online video platform, where people can share videos. In particular, the setup in mind is that AIs and humans are agents sharing content on YouTube. Each agent has its own channel and their messages in the form of videos are indistinguishable. As agents are interacting, they change their beliefs based on the content they observe.\nAs in YouTube, the popularity of a channel is a measure of its success, which is commonly expressed in terms of the number of views. In this context, note that the fitness function in Eq. 8 for each agent is equivalent to the \"views\" of the channel plus a penalty for when the message (i.e. generated video content) does not reflect the opinion of the channel. This leads to a first AI dominance metric called AI Views ($r_{AIV}$), the percentage of views that AIs receive compared to the total population, and a second AI dominance metric called AI Fitness ($r_{AIF}$), the percentage of fitness of AIs (computed according to Eq. 8) compared to the total population.\nAs another key AI dominance metric in this setting, we look into the belief systems of the agents. Since the agents' belief systems are implemented on an integer number line, we take the leftmost belief, i.e. b = 0, as an extreme belief of interest. As we are interested in whether AI can influence the beliefs of humans, this leads to an AI dominance metric called Human Belief 0 ($r_{HB0}$), the proportion of humans that have the zero belief (b = 0).\nWithin this setting, we demonstrate Digico in a multi-population setup, where there is one AI sub-population of 10 agents and two human sub-populations of 10 agents each. This setup represents a scenario in which a significant proportion (one third) of the social network is an AI (e.g. an LLM that creates its own content), and in which the AIs can evolve according to distinct rules compared to humans. We also distinguish between two groups of humans as we are interested to see if given an initially similarly initialised set of humans may diverge in beliefs and genotype based on inputs from the digital ecosystem. The subpopulations all act in the same digital ecosystem but each are optimised independently with their own CMA-ES solver."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Using Digico, we analyse two scenarios of interest, directly related to the AI Views ($r_{AIV}$) and Human Belief 0 ($r_{HB0}$) metrics within online video platforms. Since AIs with varying capabilities may inhabit such platforms, we"}, {"title": "4.1 Scenario 1: AI-generated content gets most of the views", "content": "Various reports project that the majority of content may be AI-generated by 2026 [8, 26]. Indeed, on platforms such as YouTube, one may already observe a significant proportion of AI-generated content. It remains unclear whether in this case, AIs will get most of the views or not. We investigate this question empirically below.\nFindings As shown in Fig. 2 (see also Appendix B), each of the AI capabilities contributes to an increase in $r_{AIV}$. When AIs have the same capabilities as humans, AIs get around a third of the views (i.e. at chance level). When AIs have all the capabilities, namely more frequent content publication, faster evolution, more influence on the recommendation algorithm, and fixing the belief of the AIs, AIs get up to 84% of the views. The largest effects are observed for advantages in the recommendation and more frequent content publishing. Noting that the results are averaged across belief weight updates, we confirm in Tab. 5 (see Appendix B) that the $r_{AIV}$ has only a few percent changes based on the belief weight update.\nBeyond these two findings we also investigate variations of the recommendation algorithm. First, increasing the observation sparsity, which indicates the proportion of channels that are cut off from receiving views from any particular agent, Fig. 3a demonstrates a case where the recommendation algorithm gets progressively less equitable and diverse, recommending only channels with similar beliefs, geographic proximity, and high influence. This effect is limited to a 2% increase in $r_{AIV}$. Second, Fig. 3b shows that a larger effect is observed when the role of influence is more important in the recommendation algorithm, with an $r_{AIV}$ of 95% for the maximal considered importance as compared to 60% for the minimal considered importance.\nAdvice The main advice following from the above results is for government or platforms to make rules to limit the number of videos that can be posted by a single channel, to limit multi-accounting, and to maintain an equitable recommendation system such that a variety of sources maintain a good proportion of the views."}, {"title": "4.2 Scenario 2: Propaganda is effective in convincing humans to adopt extreme beliefs", "content": "We now turn to a particular scenario in which AI-generated content manages to persuade humans into taking on particular beliefs. We look in particular to propaganda, which refers to communication that is used to persuade or influence an audience, often using misleading information that fits a narrative and induces a perception rather than staying objective. History is full of examples where leaders aim to get public support in a variety of domains, including war, finance, culture, lifestyle, etc., with common examples being cold war and Nazi propaganda. One of the common fears for AI safety, raised for instance by Elon Musk, is that governments may use AI to design highly effective propaganda to manipulate the population into accepting false information and misguided policies. Since social media are not limited to government actors, our scenario is more general than this, and we consider any form of concerted effort where a group of AIs jointly seeks to influence humans to particularly extreme beliefs. To investigate this scenario, we focus on the Human Belief 0 ($r_{HB0}$) metric as introduced in Section 3.2.\nFindings As shown in Fig. 4, AIs with all capabilities yield the highest Human Belief 0 with an $r_{HB0} = 49\\%$ compared to $r_{HB0} = 5\\%$ without any extra capabilities. While most of the increase is explained by fixing the AIs to the zero belief (which yields $r_{HB0} = 48\\%$), one can observe 10% of humans having the zero belief when AIs have all other capabilities. Further, we find that taking into account the opinions of many different channels is highly important, which is supported by two findings. First, fixing the belief weights over time generally leads to worst outcomes, with 72% of humans adopting the zero belief. Second, as one increases belief sparsity (see Fig. 5a), which indicates the proportion of channels that are cut off from changing any particular agent's belief, this can lead to a further 13% increase up to a staggering 85% score. Last, truthfulness, which defines how much agents are penalised for sending messages that violate their beliefs, is shown to reduce the effectiveness of propaganda, particularly with reward-based weight updates. In this setting, we observe $r_{HB0} = 38\\%$ for the lowest setting and $r_{HB0} = 30\\%$ for the highest setting (see Fig.5b).\nAdvice In addition to the above-mentioned mitigation tactics (limits on content, multi-accounting, and equitable recommendations), we can urge people to take many channels' opinions into consideration and to learn how to detect deception."}, {"title": "4.3 Further analysis of the ecosystem", "content": "We present a few further analyses for more insights into the simulations, including a visualisation of the belief distribution, genetic diversity statistics, and a larger-scale study involving 300 agents.\nIn terms of the belief distribution, the different conditions yield varying outcomes, as illustrated with a few examples in Fig. 6). In the None Random condition, the AIs and humans are spread uniformly over the belief space. In the All"}, {"title": "5 Related work", "content": "We now turn to a discussion of the features of Digico, our findings, and how these connect to prior works in evolutionary computing, artificial life, network science, cognitive science, and multi-agent systems.\nDigico relates to various works in evolutionary computation. A first line of related works includes memetic computation [27-29], cultural evolution [30], and Lamarckian algorithms [31,32], all of which involve inheritance of information that is obtained via communication and/or learning during the lifetime. Different works use such principles to improve the rate of convergence and find solutions that can not be found with pure random mutations, and the focus is primarily on optimisation rather than understanding the development of systems. In Digico, the genotype encodes the messaging strategies (comparable to memes) but the underlying beliefs are represented as a separate process which can dynamically alter which messaging strategies are optimal. Within-lifetime adaptations are natural due to the time-step based interactions with the environment and the belief dynamics. Digico at present uses either random updates or simple reward-following updates to the belief weight vector, which may be improved in the future with logical reasoning or machine learning algorithms. As a second line of related works, Digico may be understood in terms of different configurations of multi-population EAs [33], which can be defined in terms of competitive vs cooperative, distinct graph relations between the populations, and the kind of information being shared across the populations. However, Digico additionally incorporates belief update rules, variable rates of evolution and action, and potentially many other differences. Moreover, Digico leaves room for rich per-step interactions in the environment that go beyond selection and evaluation by including a rich environment with cross-generational preservation of state.\nOther works have also explored simulating societies with artificial agent societies, albeit with different purpose than Digico. This includes works aimed at aligning AIs with human preferences [34], works that study how agents can evolve behaviour, communication, and tool use [35], as well as works that allow to study the evolutionary theories [36, 37]. Compared to such simulators, Digico is a simulation framework suitable for studying how representations of belief systems may evolve over time based on agent interactions and Darwinian processes, with a specific focus on emphasising the difference in humans and AIs. Another essential difference is that the present study specifically sets out to study a system comparable to content sharing platforms.\nPrevious work studying content sharing platforms with contagion models have demonstrated findings related to ours. In particular, it was shown that network segregation leads to more easy spread of false information, since such information will be shared only by susceptible individuals [38\u201340]. Digico defines much more advanced agents, optimised by evolution, within a network structure that is in principle fully connected but where a) niche geometry, influence relations, and sparsity parameters lead to probabilistic segregation, such that humans rarely attend any messages other than those of AIs, and b) beliefs are changed based on a limited set of fixed thought leaders, which is based on a formulation comparable to cognitive cascades, where agents will take over beliefs from other agents if these are deemed to be plausible [12]. In addition to the cognitive cascade formulation, the belief weight vector in Digico further allows adaptivity in terms of whom to believe, modelling the change of credibility factors across time. These features allow Digico to cover a wide variety of phenomena, including subpopulations that are progressively segregating or integrating in terms of their beliefs.\nFinally, it is worth commenting on the Digico formalism in terms of decision theory, RL, and multi-agent systems. Digico relates to partially observable Markov decision processes in the sense that each agent has a partial view of the environment, and acts to maximise the cumulative reward. With multiple agents, the system relates to the partially observable stochastic games (POSG) formalism (see e.g. [41]). At present, Digico is formulated for a wider setting and therefore makes use of an EA as a blackbox optimiser, which additionally comes with favourable parallelisation, computation, and exploration properties [21,22]. However, it is possible to view POSGs as a special case, by putting"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion and future work", "content": "This paper presents Digico, a simulation framework for evolutionary computation, designed to simulate groups of interacting agents with varying features, evolution rules, and belief dynamics. The framework allows for simulating potentially harmful outcomes such as the spread of false beliefs, conflicts due to contrasting beliefs, etc., and more generally, to study how subpopulations with different capabilities may influence each other in terms of phenotype, beliefs, and action strategies in a complex ecosystem with limited observations. Studying the interaction between AIs and humans in a scenario inspired by online video platforms, we find that 1) AIs obtain the majority of views when they can share content more frequently and"}]}

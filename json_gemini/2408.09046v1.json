Trust is one of the essential factors in\nautonomous and automated technology [1, 51] and will become more urgent in driverless\nvehicles in the upcoming decade. Human drivers have become superfluous within driverless,\nautomated, and self-driving vehicles. Thus, in the cases of fully and highly automated driving,\ntrust can no longer be provided by the presence of a driver or a fallback driver. The driving\nsystem itself must provide trust. Especially where these vehicles are required to operate in\nchallenging environments and unexpected scenarios, the innovative and cost-effective HMI\nand UI must enhance passenger trust by, e.g., emotion regulation [9, 18]. Active emotion\nregulation in inevitable fear and stress-provoking situations increased the trust, comfort, and\npleasure in self-driving vehicles. By effectively addressing passengers' emotional needs and\nexpectations, automotive UI and HMI enable trustworthy autonomous vehicles in sustainable\ntransportation systems.\nThis paper explores the potential of HMI and UI in achieving trust and emotion regulation\nfor self-driving vehicles. Through a comprehensive literature review, this work examines\nthe impact of various HMI and UI concepts on passenger emotions and proposes innovative\nsolutions for improving human-vehicle interaction. Finally, the paper discusses whether HMI\nand UI are suitable for calming passengers down in emergencies and challenging environments\nto enable smart and trustful mobility."}, {"title": "2 USER INTERACTION CLUSTERS IN PARTIAL AND FULL AUTOMATED\nVEHICLES", "content": "Considering the needs of the passenger in fully automated vehicles and the needs of both\nthe diver and the passenger in partially automated vehicles, nine interaction clusters can be"}, {"title": "3 \u039c\u039f\u039d\u039f-MODAL USER INTERFACES", "content": "Mono-model UI uses visual, auditory or haptic channels to communicate with the passengers\nand drivers\u2014the olfactory channel has not yet been used in the context of self-driving\nvehicles.

Thus, this section briefly reviews the theoretical\nframework in this field. The research of a multisensory perspective toward perception goes\nback to the Gestalt movement. The Gestalt movement resulted from a backlash against\nthe dominance of the reductionist theories. The Gestalt movement circles the idea that\nperception should be viewed as a holistic phenomenon [27].\nThe idea of a holistic phenomenon is translated into one of the central notions of Gestalt\ntheory, namely holism or the principle of totality. According to this principle, a sensory\nwhole transcends its parts and becomes something else in its quality [58]. Gestalt theory\npaved the way for research on multisensory integration. Stein and Meredith [52] introduced\nintegrative rules for multisensory integration. The first rule, the spatial rule, states that\nspatial coincidence enhances the responses of multimodal neurons while spatial non-alignment\ndepresses their responses. The second or temporal rule suggests that temporal proximity\nenhances neural responses. The final rule, or the inverse effectiveness rule, proposes that the\nmagnitude of response enhancement is inversely related to the intensity of a stimulus. A\nstimulus with a weak intensity results in a more significant response enhancement than a\nstimulus with high intensity [31].\nOne problem with sensory processing is how noisy neural processes are. As a result, an\nessential component of these processes has to be the reduction of the variance to create the\nbest sensory estimates. One influential model that strives to explain this outcome in the\nmultisensory integration processes is the maximum likelihood estimation model based on\nforced-fusion and Gaussian assumptions. This model proposes that multisensory integration"}, {"title": "5 TRUST AND EMOTION USER INTERFACES", "content": "Fully automated self-driving vehicles present unique difficulties when it comes to users'\ncomfort, cf. interaction cluster IV), users' trust cf. cluster VIII) and users' emotions cf.\ncluster IX). Although the burden of driving tasks is lifted from users, it does not guarantee\na comfortable experience for passengers. Focussing on unexpected events and automation\nsurprise, i.e., the consequence of the system doing something the user did not expect [12] UI\nand HMI for level 4 and 5 vehicles are explored in this section.\nUnexpected events and automation surprises can cause negative emotions such as stress\nin users [14, 53]. Thus, examining how users handle these circumstances and regulate\ntheir negative emotions is essential. Emotion regulation refers to efforts to control what,\nwhen, and how emotions are experienced and expressed. Gross [21] divides strategies of\nemotion regulation into two categories of: antecedent-focused and response-focused strategies.\nAntecedent-focused strategies include strategies that focus on regulating emotion before the\nresponse to it emerges. These include situation selection, situation modification, attention\ndeployment, and cognitive change. Response-focused strategies are those strategies that\ncommence after the emotional response has already started. These strategies aim to affect\nemotional response's behavioral, physiological, and experiential aspects [20]. These strategies\ncould also be categorized along the dimensions of emotion regulation goal-explicit and\nimplicit-and emotion regulation process (controlled and automatic) [10]. Users may use any\nof these strategies to deal with discomfort. However, some of these strategies are maladaptive\nand can lead to avoidance and distrust of automation.\nMoreover, interventions to help users successfully regulate their emotions could be imple-\nmented to prevent such outcomes. As reviewed by Braun et al. [8] there is a range of studies\ninvestigating possible interventions to regulate stress and discomfort during driving. These\ninterventions use various techniques such as implicit influencing using ambient lights[22],\ntemperature [47], and music [28]. It is useful to review these strategies even if this work\nfocuses on fully automated vehicles and improving user experience and comfort."}, {"title": "6 CONCEPTS ON USER INTERFACES FOR BUILDING TRUST AND\nREGULATING EMOTIONS", "content": "Building trust and regulating emotions must be tailored to each passenger's needs as discussed\nin Section 5. For handling the UI in emergency situations, like a sudden appearance of a\ndeer ahead of an automated vehicle cf. Fig. 2 (a), this section first conceptualized an ideal\nHMI based on the literature reviewed in Table 1 and the previous sections. Based on this\nconcept, the research directions that are needed are discussed in the remainder.\nFocusing on regulating negative emotions triggered by unexpected events and emergency\nsituations on every single passenger, UI must focus on every single passenger's needs.\nConsequently, the first step is detecting signals of stress in each user. Measures of physiological\nand physical responses related to stress include a wide range of signals such as heart rate,\nskin conductance, pupil size, and respiratory rate. Measuring multiple signals is preferable as\nmultimodal biosignal analysis allows for capturing a more accurate picture of the emotional\nstate [30].\nHMI should be able to incorporate such measures and thus provide multimodal emotional\nregulation interventions at appropriate times for each passenger. One possible way to\nincorporate these measures and deliver emotional regulation intervention is by utilizing\nwearable technology. Wearable technology has been repeatedly used in previous research\nin this field. They can measure various physiological responses and are easy to use for\neach passenger. E-textiles are similarly capable of delivering interventions and measuring\nstress-related signals. As seen in Fig. 3, a smartwatch measures the individual stress level of"}]}

This ability allows humans to\ncreate mental maps, navigate through environments, and process directional cues, crucial for exploring\nnew places and finding one's way in unfamiliar surroundings. This study takes an algorithmic\napproach to extract indices relevant to human spatial navigation using eye movement data. Leveraging\nelectrooculography signals, we analyzed statistical features and applied feature engineering techniques\nto study eye movements during navigation tasks. The proposed work combines signal processing\nand machine learning approaches to develop indices for navigation and orientation, spatial anxiety,\nlandmark recognition, path survey, and path route. The analysis yielded five subscore indices with\nnotable accuracy. Among these, the navigation and orientation subscore achieved an R2 score of\n0.72, while the landmark recognition subscore attained an R\u00b2 score of 0.50. Additionally, statistical\nfeatures highly correlated with eye movement metrics, including blinks, saccades, and fixations, were\nidentified.

Spatial navigation tasks can detect structural changes in subcortical brain\nareas related to cognitive decline risk Chen et al. [2023b]. Different neurodegenerative conditions see impaired spatial\nnavigation as a symptom at the onset; thus, it can be a valuable predictor of dementia in subjective cognitive decline\npatients or those with mild cognitive impairment Tangen et al.

This section reviews studies and methods for\nevaluating spatial navigation, highlighting existing techniques, their applications, and insights into spatial cognition\nacross diverse populations. Many physical tasks have been designed to assess spatial navigation. Charlotta Hamre et al.\nutilized the Floor Maze Test (FMT) in individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease Hamre et al. [2020], while\nRiccardo Maria Martoni et al. used the Walking Corsi Test across all age groups to measure subjects' performances\non space representation tasks Castilla et al. [2022]. However, the FMT may not fully capture the spatial abilities of\ncognitively healthy individuals, and the Walking Corsi Test is criticized for lacking ecological validity in real-world\nnavigation scenarios.\nVirtual-reality (VR) tasks offer several advantages over physical activities in assessing spatial navigation. The VR\nprovides a controlled and ecologically valid environment for studying spatial navigation Creem-Regehr et al. [2022].\nKiran Ijaz et al. used a VR platform to perform a landmark recall test. Participants identified landmarks within a virtual\nenvironment, with the assessment focusing on correct recalls, navigational mistakes, task duration, engagement levels,\nand stress levels Ijaz et al. [2019].\nTanya Garg et al. tested spatial abilities using the mobile game Sea Hero Quest (SHQ), which included wayfinding,\npath integration, and spatial memory tasks. Participants also completed the mental rotation, visuospatial processing, and\nworking memory tests, revealing a positive relationship between performance in the wayfinding task and visuospatial\nskills, indicating that different navigation aspects require distinct skill sets Garg et al. [2024]. Alan J. Smith et al. used\na virtual game where participants navigated a virtual city to locate landmarks and later recalled and delivered items to\nthese locations, assessing spatial navigation and memory recall abilities based on the time taken to find each location\nSmith et al. [2024]. However, assessing spatial navigation in VR without questionnaires has limitations, as\nquestionnaires provide essential insights into participants' experiences, cognitive strategies, and challenges, which are\ncrucial for interpreting performance data, understanding participant engagement, and comparing results across studies.\nSeveral questionnaires evaluate spatial navigation and anxiety. The Navigation Strategy Questionnaire (NSQ) assesses\nindividual differences across three subscales: Egocentric Spatial Updating, Survey-Based Strategy, and Procedural\nStrategy Garg et al. [2024]. The Santa Barbara Sense of Direction (SBSOD) Scale is a 15-item Likert scale measuring\nthe overall sense of direction Hegarty et al. [2002]. The Wayfinding Questionnaire (WQ), with 22 items, evaluates\nnavigation, orientation, spatial anxiety, and distance estimation De Rooij et al. [2019a]. Van der Ham et al. recommended\nthree steps: first, directly inquire about potential navigation problems; second, use the WQ to assess patients' perception\nof their navigational skills and spatial anxieties; lastly, employ the Leiden Navigation Test (LNT) to measure navigation"}, {"title": "3 Materials and Methods", "content": "Our approach to developing spatial navigation indices includes four essential stages: study design and data collection,\npre-processing of the data, feature extraction, and index generation (Fig. 1)."}, {"title": "3.1 Dataset Description", "content": "Twenty-seven healthy university students, averaging 21.81 years (SD=1.96), participated in the study.

Next, low-pass and high-pass filters were applied to eliminate noise.\nA low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz was used to remove high-frequency noise in the EOG signal, while\na high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.05 Hz was implemented to neutralize slow noise. A median and Savitzky-\nGolay (SG) filters were employed to reduce noise and achieve a smoother signal. The SG filter was specifically selected\nfor its superior noise reduction performance and ability to preserve essential data features Hasan et al.

This step is vital for capturing the underlying patterns and\nbehaviors within the signals, offering valuable insights into the data. In this study, 22 statistical features were selected to\nextract meaningful information from both vertical and horizontal signals. These features encompass a broad spectrum\nof statistical measures, each providing a distinct perspective on the signal data. Table 1 summarizes these features,\npresenting their mathematical definitions and interpretations.\nEach feature was meticulously chosen to enhance the understanding of the signal characteristics, enabling a robust\nanalysis suitable for further modeling and data interpretation. These features capture essential aspects of the signal,\nincluding central tendency, dispersion, distribution shape, and energy dynamics. For example, the mean, median, and\nmode offer insights into the signal's central tendency, while variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range describe\nits dispersion. Higher-order statistics, including skewness and kurtosis, provide information about the asymmetry and\npeakedness of the signal distribution. Moreover, features such as the root mean square and signal magnitude area\nquantify the signal's overall energy.

The primary objective was to identify the optimal combination of features from a predefined\nset that most accurately predicts the target variable while minimizing the risk of overfitting through regularization, as\ndetailed in Algorithm 1.\nA linear regression model within a cross-validation framework was employed to assess the predictive performance of\nvarious feature combinations systematically. The selection of features was based on their potential relevance to the\nsubscores. A K-fold cross-validation approach with five splits was utilized to ensure a robust model performance\nevaluation. This method mitigates the risk of overfitting by averaging the model's performance across multiple training\nand testing phases. The linear regression model was trained on a selected feature pair for each fold, and its predictive\naccuracy was evaluated on the corresponding test set.\nAll possible pairs of features were generated and subjected to cross-validation to identify the optimal feature pair. The\nmean squared error (MSE) was used as the evaluation metric, quantifying the average squared difference between\nobserved and predicted values. A regularization term (A = 0.005) was added to the MSE to refine the model selection.\nThis regularization penalizes large coefficients in the regression model, thereby preventing overfitting and promoting\nsimpler, more generalizable models. The final score for each feature combination was calculated as the sum of the\naverage MSE and the regularization penalty. The combination with the lowest score was deemed the optimal choice.\nThe selected feature pair was then combined into a new feature, and the process was repeated. This iterative process\ncontinued, adding each new feature combination until no further significant improvement in model accuracy, as defined\nby a predefined threshold of 0.01, was detected. This approach progressively refined the model and enhanced its\naccuracy in predicting subscores. The analysis identified the best combination of features, and their corresponding\ncoefficients provided insights into the linear relationship between these features and the target variable, facilitating\nfurther interpretation and application in the assessment of spatial navigation."}, {"title": "3.5 Evaluation Metrics", "content": "The proposed method was evaluated by analyzing the correlation of statistical features with blink, saccade, and fixation\nevents. Given that the normality assumption was violated for several features, as determined by the Shapiro-Wilk test\n(p \u2264 0.05), Spearman correlation coefficients were employed for the correlation analysis. This method is more suitable\nfor non-normally distributed data and captures monotonic relationships between variables."}, {"title": "4 Results and Discussions", "content": "Employing the proposed algorithm, a set of formulas was derived for each score by combining statistical features\nthrough addition or subtraction, resulting in dimensionless numerical values. This standardization simplifies the\ninterpretation of the results and makes further analyses more straightforward. Dimensionless scores are also more\nversatile and robust, as they are less sensitive to measurement errors and inconsistencies. The coefficients in these\nformulas ensure the final values are dimensionless, enabling accurate estimation of each subscore. These dimensionless\nvalues, along with fitted line data based on the dataset, were utilized to estimate the subscores. The performance of\nthe extracted indices is presented in Table 2. The navigation and orientation score demonstrated the best performance\namong the various scores, while the location allocentric score exhibited the least accurate estimations.\nUpon reviewing the model's performance, the proposed algorithm successfully estimated 5 out of the seven subscores\nwith reasonable accuracy.\nThe navigation and orientation (NO) score was derived as\n$$NO = (-1.03) \\times (8000 SB + 2 TK - 0.14 ZCR_h - 9 SK_n$$ +$$8 MO_v - 0.02 ER_v + 10 MA_v - 30 RMS_v) + 110.64.$$\nIn this and all of the following expressions, the abbreviations of the included features have been borrowed based on\nTable 1, and the subscripts indicate either horizontal (h) or vertical (v) signals.\nThe spatial anxiety (SA) score was denoted as\n$$SA = (-1.13) \\times (-3.6 TK_v - 52 MO_v + 0.9 EN_v - 0.02 ER_v -$$ $$13 TK_h - 0.02 ZCR_h - 31 DFA_v) - 1.84.$$\nThe landmark recognition (LR) score was extracted as\n$$LR = (-1.08) \\times (-0.2 EN_v - 1.4 RA_v - TK_h - 11 DFA_n$$ $$- MI_h - 26 MD_v) - 18.20.$$\nThe path survey (PS) score was formulated as\n$$PS = (-0.85) \\times (1.2 SK_h - 0.4 EN_h - 4.3 AUC_v$$ $$+ 0.16 KU_n) - 5.22.$$\nThe path routh (PR) score was determined as\n$$PR = (-1.04) \\times (0.34 SK_v + 0.001 SMA_v + 0.71 TK_h -$$ $$- 0.06 EN_v - 0.006 ZCR_v - 1.6 DFA_n) - 0.48.$$\nThe performance results of Equations 1 and 2 for individual cases are illustrated in Fig. 4, while the results of Equations\n3 and 5, which pertain to subscores with limited discrete values, are displayed as bar charts in Fig. 5. Based on the\ndata presented, Participant 18 demonstrated exceptionally high performance in the navigation and orientation subscale\nwhile also exhibiting low levels of spatial anxiety. In contrast, participant #24, despite scoring highly on the landmark\nrecognition subscale, performed poorly in navigation and orientation. The primary reason for this poor performance\nappears to be the participant's exceptionally high level of spatial anxiety, the highest among all participants in the\nexperiment. This anxiety likely contributed to their reduced navigation performance. Additionally, among Participants\n13, 6, and 17, who all scored perfectly in both landmark recognition and path route subscales, those with lower spatial\nanxiety (Participants 6 and 13) achieved higher scores in navigation and orientation. These findings underscore the\nsignificant role that spatial anxiety plays in influencing individuals' spatial navigation performance.\nIn evaluating spatial navigation, eye movement features have proven to be invaluable, offering profound insights into\nthe cognitive mechanisms driving navigation tasks. For example, gaze fixation patterns have been instrumental in\nunderstanding how individuals plan and execute movements, particularly in complex environments where effective\npath selection and obstacle avoidance are crucial Hunt et al. [2019]. These fixation patterns reveal that individuals tend\nto focus on their destination prior to initiating movement, and subsequently shift their gaze to monitor the travel path\nand potential obstacles. This continuous updating of visual information is essential for successful navigation Patla\net al. [2007]. Moreover, the ability to separate covert attention from gaze direction has been shown to enhance the\nefficiency of visual information processing. This separation allows for simultaneous monitoring of multiple locations,\nwhich is critical in dynamic navigation tasks Hodgson et al. [2019]. Evidence further suggests that specific eye\nmovements, such as saccades and blinks, are closely tied to cognitive processes involved in spatial navigation. For\ninstance, landmark-based navigation instructions have been associated with increased blink-related brain potentials,\nwhich in turn correlate with better spatial knowledge acquisition Wunderlich and Gramann [2021].\nStudies involving virtual environments have highlighted the role of sequential eye movements, or prospection, in both\nplanning and executing navigation tasks. This underscores a direct relationship between eye movement patterns and\nnavigational strategies Zhu et al. [2022]. The findings highlight the importance of eye movements in visually informed\nplanning and suggest their potential in assessing navigational abilities. Our proposed method was evaluated by\nexamining the correlation between statistical features and key eye movement events, including blinks, saccades, and\nfixations.\nThe significance of each feature in evaluating the navigation subscores is depicted in Fig. 6. The most influential\nstatistical features:Teager-Kaiser energy operator, skewness, and entropy were utilized in four of the derived equations."}, {"title": "5 Conclousions", "content": "This study presented a novel method for assessing spatial navigation abilities using EOG-based indices, which effectively\ncapture various facets of navigation performance.

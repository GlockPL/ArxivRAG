For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date- prediction model, trained on the basis of new 14C dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the 14C-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the 14C dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79% of the samples were considered \u2018realistic' upon palaeo- graphic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The 14C ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granu- larity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date pre- diction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Radiocarbon dating", "content": "We performed 14C dating on 30 undated manuscripts from 4 sites, spanning an estimated 5 centuries: 25 from the Qumran caves, 1 from Masada, 2 from the Murabba\u02bbat caves, and 2 from the Nahal Hever caves. Twenty-eight manuscripts were made of animal skin or parchment, and 2 of papyrus.\nSamples were selected because of their script and presumed period, the manuscripts having a sufficient number of characters for Enoch to be trained, and also on the basis of practical and conservational considerations (see Section B.1 in Appendix B). One date-bearing document, Mur19, was used as a validation test for 14C, but did not go into the training of Enoch because of its cursive script.\nThe scrolls are extremely delicate material. As in the previous attempts made at dating the scrolls [19, 20], we, too, had to adjust the standard chemical AAA (Acid-Alkali-Acid) pretreatment (see Section B.2 in Appendix B). Also, many fragments are contaminated with castor oil, which scholars in the 1950s used to improve the readability of the scrolls' text [21\u201323]. This study is the first to apply, prior to 14C dating, a chemical treatment specifically designed for removing fatty materials, employing solvent extraction (see Sections B.2 and B.7.1 in Appendix B). Further specialized analytical chemistry methods were applied before and after the sample pretreatment to demonstrate that the total amount of lipid materials is below a threshold that does not significantly skew the 14C date (see Sections B.7.2\u2013B.7.5 in Appendix B).\nThe samples were dated by two Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) machines (see Section B.3 in Appendix B)."}, {"title": "2 Integration of multiple dating methods", "content": "We used 24 manuscripts from the 14C samples with accepted dates as labeled data for the primary training set for Enoch (see Sections B.4\u2013B.6 in Appendix B and Section D.2 in Appendix D). For the data labels, we used OxCal v4.4.2 [24, 25] to obtain the raw data points for the probability distributions. This is because the 14C results are not single dates, as with date- bearing documents, but represent date ranges with probability distributions. The 14C data input for training Enoch consists of the probability distributions of accepted 2-sigma (2\u03c3) calibrated ranges (see Section E.6 in Appendix E).\nIn addition to the primary training set, we created different combina- tions of training data to perform comparative analyses and further check the robustness of the model. These combinations include the tentative addition or omission of 4Q52, some previously tested 14C samples [19, 20], date-bearing documents from the fifth-fourth centuries BCE and the second century CE (see Tables I17 and I18 in Appendix I for complete lists of manuscripts), the Maresha ostracon from 176 BCE (see Section A.1 in Appendix A), and leave-one-out of the training data points."}, {"title": "2.1 Deep neural networks for detection of handwritten ink-trace patterns", "content": "The physical 24 14C-dated manuscripts are visually available on many indi- vidual images of the IAA's Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library collection [26]. We also use images from Brill Publishers [27], especially in cases where the manuscript is unavailable in the IAA collection. For this study, these images underwent multiple preprocessing measures to become suitable for pattern recognition-based techniques. It should be noted that the images are extremely difficult to work with (some examples can be seen in Figure E9 in Appendix E and Figure G22 in Appendix G; see also Section G.1 in Appendix G). We are not dealing with digitally encoded text but with pixel images of highly degraded manuscripts as input.\nWe utilize multispectral band images of each fragment and employ an in-house image fusion technique [28] to generate a three-channel image. The resulting image representation enhances ink-vs-background contrast and there- fore facilitates the effective separation of ink from backgrounds, commonly called binarization. For this purpose, we employ BiNet [28], an artificial neural network based on an encoder-decoder U-net architecture designed to binarize the diverse range of scroll images. The resulting binarized images consist solely of black foreground pixels (ink) against a white background, ensuring that subsequent analyses focus exclusively on the handwritten patterns while min- imizing inadvertent matches due to material-texture attributes. We further correct the rotation of the binarized images and divide them into multiple parts to maintain a balanced distribution of handwritten characters within each new image. No extraneous image material was used to train this binarization method.\nThus, we obtained a data set of 75 images from the 24 14C-dated manuscripts. We used 62 of these images to train Enoch. The remaining 13 images, chosen deliberately and randomly, were passed as unseen test data to cross-validate the robustness and reliability of Enoch's performance. The prediction of these 13 images by Enoch gives an 85.14% overlap to the orig- inal 14C probability distributions (see Table I16 in Appendix I). The image samples typically contain 150-200 characters, which has been shown to be sufficient for the comparable task of writer identification [29]."}, {"title": "2.2 Extracting features for style attribution", "content": "It should be noted that in this context, 'style' is not related to textual con- tent or wording. In fact, for characterizing the handwritten shapes, small shapes along the ink trace are used, largely uncoupled from the textual con- tent, because we want to avoid spurious matches or date predictions on the basis of textual content. Once the training images were available, we could perform feature extraction techniques to translate handwriting patterns into feature vectors. The feature vectors relate directly to the shape-based evi- dence of the ink traces in the manuscripts and have a solid basis in writer identification [30\u201332] and document dating [33, 34]. We extract features from both the allographic and textural levels of characters [35]. An overview of machine-learning methods can be found in [36].\nThe first, allographic, method uses a self-organized character map obtained using a Kohonen neural network. As an example, this allographic codebook feature allows for a 93% (\u00b1 \u03c3 = 2.3%) accuracy classification of the scripts 'Hasmonaean' vs. 'Herodian', using PCA, on 590 labeled manuscripts, results averaged over 32 random odd/even splits for training/testing [37]. The second, textural, method uses statistical pattern recognition on angular information. The 'hinge' method for estimating the curvature distribution has been used extensively in writer verification and dating studies [32, 33, 38]. Whereas the allographic feature addresses stylistic elements at the character level, the 'hinge' method concerns a micro-level feature directly related to the origi- nal writing activity that yielded the curvature of the ink trace. Therefore, we make a weighted combination of textural and allographic features to obtain an adjoined feature vector for each manuscript image. Such a feature vector constitutes the input data to Enoch."}, {"title": "2.3 Bayesian ridge regression", "content": "Due to the limited size of the data set, we cannot employ high-parametric models like period-specific temporal codebooks [34]. Instead, we utilize con- ditional modeling with Bayesian ridge regression [39]. This approach applies Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters for date prediction. By plac- ing a prior distribution on the parameters and updating it with observed data using Bayes' rule, we obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters and predicted dates. The Bayesian approach is chosen because our target output data represents probability curves for 14C dates (i.e., a vector) containing the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated \u2018OxCal' ranges. This probabilistic approach enables us to incorporate all available information while maintaining interpretabil- ity. Moreover, instead of producing a single number for the estimated date of a sample, it provides a comprehensive posterior distribution that allows us to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimated dates. Addition- ally, Enoch can utilize the Bayesian approach to provide error margins for predictions on unseen data."}, {"title": "2.4 Testing Enoch", "content": "Once Enoch was trained, we performed the validation by leave-one-out tests to check its performance. At this point, we took the calibrated style-based date estimation method of Enoch and applied it to a collection of 135 unseen manuscripts from the Dead Sea Scrolls as test data (see Table I15 in Appendix I).\nWe use two types of data-balancing techniques to compensate for the imbal- anced distribution of the training data over different periods. One balancing technique involves data augmentation using random elastic morphing [40] to create a balanced training data distribution. The second balancing is done on the output date predictions. This post-data-balancing uses accumulated training probabilities and training data point counts with 5%, 10%, and 20% threshold values to avoid under-sampled time regions.\nThe general recipe for Enoch's analysis of manuscript images is presented in Table 1. Before applying this to scrolls manuscripts, we tried out a known mediaeval, dated benchmark data set of charters, MPS [34], with success [41]."}, {"title": "3 14C dates and palaeographic estimates", "content": "The AMS results yielded 26 accepted 14C dates (see Sections B.4-B.6 in Appendix B), which are shown in Table B1 (Appendix B). The historical date preserved in Mur19 is consistent with the calibrated age range obtained by 14C (see Section B.4 in Appendix B). Overall, we improved and extended the existing series of 14C-dated Dead Sea Scrolls [19, 20].\nFigure 1 shows the comparison between the 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges and tra- ditional palaeographic estimates (in blue and red). This demonstrates that 17 of the 26 sampled manuscripts have whole or partial overlap, and 9 out of 26 samples yield calibrated ages that do not overlap with previous palaeographic estimates (see Appendix D).\nOverall, the 14C results indicate older date ranges for individual manuscripts as well as for the emergence of the so-called \u2018Hasmonaean' and 'Herodian' scripts. Only two manuscripts have date ranges that go in the direc- tion of a younger possible range. The 14C results for most manuscripts confirm the basic distinction between Hasmonaean-type manuscripts that are older, and Herodian-style manuscripts that are younger, and also between so-called 'Archaic' and Hasmonaean-type manuscripts.\nHowever, the 14C date ranges for manuscripts that are traditionally con- sidered Hasmonaean and Herodian are quite differently distributed across the timeline. As can be seen in Figure 1 (in blue), Hasmonaean-type manuscripts are all grouped together in a narrower part of the timeline but Herodian- type manuscripts are more spread out across the timeline, extending from the second century CE all the way back to the second century BCE (see Sections D.1.1\u2013D.1.3 in Appendix B).\nSample 4Q114 is one of the most significant findings of the 14C results. The manuscript preserves Daniel 8-11, which scholars date on literary-historical grounds to the 160s BCE [42, 43]. The accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated peak for 4Q114, 230-160 \u0412\u0421E, overlaps with the period in which the final part of the biblical book of Daniel was presumably authored (see Section D.1.2 in Appendix D)."}, {"title": "4 Validation of Enoch", "content": "Figure 1 (in green) also shows the results of cross-validation and leave-one- out tests for training Enoch. The choice for the bandwidths (2\u03c3 date ranges for 14C, 1\u03c3 uncertainties of the ridge regression for style-based predictions) is based on the intrinsic reliability of the two information sources. 14C date ranges are evidently superior to style-based predictions.\nEnoch's style-based predictions largely follow the 14C results, even though the validation samples (rows) are in no way present in the training data. In the range 300-50 BCE, Enoch's estimates provide a more fine-grained distribution than the 14C results. For samples 5/6Hevlb, Mas1k, and XHev/Se2, the style- based estimate is earlier and more uncertain. However, 11Q5 shows that in this late date range, a fairly certain style-based date estimate above 100 CE can also be achieved. This may go against historical reconstructions according to which the scrolls were hidden in the Qumran caves before the summer of 68 CE [44]. Yet, we did not impose here a chronological limit on the model, because of the 14C result for 11Q5, and in order to examine the possibility of style continuation after 70 \u0421\u0415.\nRegarding the differences between the 14C date ranges and Enoch's script style-based estimates, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 30.7 years. The MAE drops to 27.9 years when minor peaks (less than 4% in all cases except for 5.2% in 4Q2 and 9.4% in 4Q416) are ignored (see Figure H26 in Appendix H). In manuscript dating, MAE is commonly used [45] for evaluation of a regression method. The difference with rms error is limited [46]. With the chosen 2\u03c3 (14C) and 1\u03c3 (AI) bandwidths, the error for the leftmost margin is 6.4 years while for the rightmost margin it equals -38.4 years, indicating that Enoch's style- based estimate range ends earlier than the 14C range. For each sample, the date ranges of the two information sources have partial to full overlap with an average of 88.8%. For Ithaca [18], AI and epigraphy were used as two informa- tion sources to predict dates for ancient Greek inscriptions. Their prediction provides an average distance of 29.3 years from the target dating brackets, with a median distance of 3 years based on the totality of texts. We also aim for date prediction tasks, but, unlike Ithaca, we utilize three information sources: 14C, shape-based writing style analysis (AI), and palaeography.\nFigure 1 shows the general result that, on average, 14C date ranges and Enoch's predictions indicate older dates than palaeography. Only 4Q201 and 11Q5 have older palaeographic date estimates, although there is an overlap with the 14C results (see Section D.1.1 in Appendix D)."}, {"title": "5 Harvest of Enoch's date predictions for previously undated manuscripts", "content": "Table 2 summarizes Enoch's date predictions for 135 previously undated manuscripts. Expert palaeographers evaluated the style-based date predic- tions, condensing the prediction into two main categories: realistic and unrealistic, the latter subdivided into too old and too young (see Appendix G).\nAs can be seen in Table 2, 107 (79%) of the undated manuscripts were dated realistically, according to the palaeographers. Enoch's date prediction task is not a 50/50, binary decision task but regressive, with many possible years in the interval 300 BCE-200 CE. Assuming a coarseness of 25 years, as in the MPS project [34], the date range would consist of 20 bins, with a 5% prior-probability hit rate. Therefore, a success rate of 79% is unlikely to be accidental. For 21% of the manuscripts, the palaeographers judged Enoch's date predictions to be unrealistic. Enoch's 28 unrealistic predictions were divided between too old (46%) and too young (39%).\nSamples 4Q259 and 4Q319 show that Enoch can accurately find the same date estimate for the same writing styles. The accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range of 4Q259 was used to train Enoch. Images of 4Q319 were part of a test set already in 2021. 4Q259 contains text that is part of the so-called Rule of the Community. 4Q319 contains a calendrical text. Because of perceived generic differences, 4Q319 received a separate classification number but is materially actually part of the same manuscript as 4Q259 [47]. At the time of the test, 6 July 2021, this identity was not known to the AI experts. Figure 2 shows that Enoch was able to give a date prediction estimate for 4Q319 that matches the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range of 4Q259 (see Section G.5 in Appendix G)."}, {"title": "6 Discussion and conclusions", "content": "This study in style-based date prediction using the Enoch approach is a first step.

The 14C data generated in this study in combination with machine- learning-based writing style analysis enabled us to examine Aramaic/Hebrew script in individual manuscripts with an empirically based precision that was not possible before. We combined palaeography, AI, and 14C to create a date- prediction model that leads to a new chronology of the scrolls during the third century BCE until the second century CE. We give four novel insights into Aramaic/Hebrew script development during this period and the date of individual manuscripts.\nFirst, 14C date ranges and Enoch's style-based estimates are overall older than previous palaeographic estimates. These older dates for the scrolls are realistic. Hasmonaean-type manuscripts have accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges that allow for older dates in the first half of the second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier, instead of only circa 150\u201350 BCE. There are no compelling palaeographic or historical reasons that preclude these older dates as reliable time markers for the \u2018Hasmonaean' script. This also applies to the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range for 4Q70 and its \u2018Archaic' script.\nSecond, 'Herodian' script emerged earlier than previously thought. This suggests that the \u2018Hasmonaean' and \u2018Herodian' scripts were not transitioning from the mid-first century BCE onward, but that they existed next to each other at a considerably earlier date.\nThird, this novel approach of palaeography leads to a new chronology of the scrolls that impacts our understanding of the history of ancient Judaea and the people behind the scrolls. Hypotheses about whether the movement behind the scrolls originated in the second or first century BCE will need to be reconsidered in light of Enoch's second-century BCE date predictions for Hasmonaean-type manuscripts such as 1QS and 4Q163 (see Appendix G), bearing texts that are regarded typical for the movement. Scholars often assume that the rise and expansion of the Hasmonaean kingdom from the mid-second century BCE onward caused a rise in literacy and gave a push to scribal and intellectual culture. Yet, the results of this study attest to the copying of multiple literary manuscripts before this period. One example is 4Q109, a copy of the biblical book of Ecclesiastes, a book which scholars ten- tatively date to the end of the third century BCE [42], for which Enoch gives a third-century BCE date prediction (see Appendix G), close to Archaic-type manuscripts such as 4Q52 and 4Q70\u2014copies of the biblical books of Samuel and Jeremiah.\nFourth, this study's 14C result for 4Q114 and Enoch's date prediction for 4Q109 now establish these to be the first known fragments of a biblical book from the time of their presumed authors [42]. Also, Enoch's integra- tion of multiple dating methods yields a strongly improved value of sources of evidence and allows for a mutual confirmation of evidence from the two sources\u2014physical (material) and geometric (shape-based).\nThe results of this study thus dismantle unsubstantiated historical suppo- sitions and chronological limitations, and call into question the validity of the default model's relative typology. This relative typology can only be main- tained with restrictions. The spread of the Hasmonaean-type manuscripts over the timeline does not affect the default relative typology in a major way, but the older, second-century BCE date ranges of the Herodian-type manuscripts challenge the relative typology. More research is needed to solve this issue."}, {"title": "6.2 The Enoch approach to dating ancient manuscripts", "content": "To our knowledge, Enoch is the first complete machine-learning-based model that employs raw image inputs to deliver probabilistic date predictions for handwritten manuscripts utilizing the entire probability distribution from 14C output, and that is completed by palaeographic input while ensuring trans- parency and interpretability through its explainable design. Palaeographers and historians may now use Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach to palaeography as a tool to examine date predictions. The probability-based options can help in decision-making and to explicate qualitative palaeo- graphic reasoning. Also, the methods underpinning Enoch can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections.\nIt could be argued that the style-based predictions are influenced by the 14C-based training of the model. However, the leave-one-out validation results indicate that unseen samples obtain their interpolated position on the time axis based on the detected handwriting style in the images. The placement of an unseen sample on the time axis is not fundamentally constrained. Any date in the time range of 300 BCE to 200 CE could have been reached, looking at all style-based dates empirically covered by the model.\nIn this study, we have avoided using palaeographic estimates as target values for machine learning because our goal is to provide physical (material) and geometric (shape-based) evidences for manuscript dating. While the use of palaeographic estimates as target values for machine learning is technically possible, we consider it too risky, given the existing uncertainties and lack of consensus associated with the precise dating of individual manuscripts."}, {"title": "7 Online content", "content": "All data, code, and test film associated with this article are publicly available on Zenodo with the following DOIs:"}, {"title": "8 Supplementary information", "content": "This article has ten supplementary materials:\n\u2022 Appendix A: The dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls\n\u2022 Appendix B: Radiocarbon dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls\n\u2022 Appendix C: 14C determinations and calibrated date plots\n\u2022 Appendix D: Palaeography and radiocarbon dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls\n\u2022 Appendix E: Artificial intelligence (AI) in dating the scrolls\n\u2022 Appendix F: On the use of pre-trained deep learning methods for image- based dating\n\u2022 Appendix G: Enoch's date predictions for 135 previously undated manuscripts\n\u2022 Appendix H: Comparative plots for different information sources\n\u2022 Appendix I: List of images for different tests\n\u2022 Appendix J: Radiocarbon sample information\n\u2022 Appendix K: Data-sheet radiocarbon runs\n\u2022 Appendix L: Worksheet of comparative data for 2\u03c3 14C dates and traditional palaeographic estimates"}, {"title": "Declarations", "content": "Please check the Instructions for Authors of the journal to which you are submitting to see if you need to complete this section.

Puech [6] provided additional pegs, specifically for the less formal Hasmonaean hands. Cross and Puech relied on inscriptions on other surfaces such as stone and metal, but here too there are no absolute dates, not even for the most important pegs, such as the Benei Hezir tomb and the Jason's tomb inscriptions. Avigad [8] acknowledged this, but his caution seems to have been forgotten.\nA telling example is the estimated date of the Benei Hezir tomb inscrip- tion in Jerusalem's Kidron Valley (CIIP 137 [55]), which, according to Cross, had been dated securely, on the basis of archaeological and historical evi- dence, to the end of the first century BCE. Based on architectural typology of the Hellenistic-style fa\u00e7ade and Josephus's description of the Maccabees' family tomb in Modi\u02bbin, Avigad [56] initially suggested to date the tomb to the mid-second century BCE. He then estimated the inscription, which lists eight priests from two generations who had been interred in the tomb, to have been made on the fa\u00e7ade one or two generations after the construction of the tomb, in the first half of the first century BCE. Later, he dated the inscrip- tion palaeographically to the second half of the first century BCE, or to the Herodian period, and on that basis redated the tomb to the end of the Has- monaean period [8]. The precise length of time between the construction of the fa\u00e7ade and the writing of the inscription (how many years are one to two generations?) is a conjecture.\nAfter the 2000\u20132001 exploration of the Benei Hezir and Zechariah tombs, Barag [57] put forward new data and interpretations which would indicate that the tomb dated to the period of flourishing in Jerusalem between ca. 132/1 and 63 BCE, most likely in the first century BCE. For example, it features the new type of tombs typical of the Hasmonaean period, which became common in the first century BCE. In the same direction point correspondences with Nabataean tomb architecture (undated but supposed to go back to the first century BCE), which, Barag argued, likely inspired the Benei Hezir tomb. As for the inscription, which he conjectured to be 50-100 years younger than the construction of the tomb, he compared its writing to that of the bronze coins of the 25th year of Alexander Jannaeus (79/8) BCE, and posited that the script of the Benei Hezir inscription would seem to be slightly later, from the late Hasmonaean or early Herodian period."}, {"title": "A.2.2 Unsubstantiated palaeographic and historical premises", "content": "Even if one were to accept Cross's recourse to a series of absolute datings, these would support mainly late first-century BCE and first-century CE com- parisons.

Lacking dated material from the third and second centuries BCE, Cross had to take further recourse to two premises to attempt to establish the upper range of the oldest scripts, \u2018Archaic' and \u2018Hasmonaean', from the scrolls, and to limit the earliest dating of the scrolls mainly to the second century BCE, with only a few exceptions for older \u2018Archaic' manuscripts such as 4Q52 and 4Q70.\nIn addition to a lack of time markers, two palaeographic and historical premises by Cross, Yardeni and others stand out: a slow development of the Aramaic/Hebrew script in the early Hellenistic period (third century BCE); and the emergence of a national script as a watershed around 200\u2013150 \u0412\u0421\u0415.\nThe presumed slow development of the Aramaic/Hebrew script in the early Hellenistic period is not supported by any dated evidence of that period. The assumption was in part based on a few undated cursive Ara- maic papyri from Egypt containing Greek names (hence assumed to be from the third century BCE), but the later discovery of the dated Wadi Daliyeh papyri showed that there were different lines of development, some having taken place much earlier [10, 64], thus challenging the premise of the slow development, and reducing the importance of those Hellenistic Egyptian Ara- maic papyri for establishing the evolution of the Aramaic/Hebrew script. For Judaea, Cross [62] also referred in passing to a conservative palaeography for the copying of sacred texts, but without further explanation or supporting evidence.\nCross initially dated 4Q52 (4QSamb) to \"the last quarter of the third century B.C.\" [62], \u201cno doubt late in the century\u201d [65], but after the discovery of the Wadi Daliyeh manuscripts, simply to \"ca. 250 B.C.\" [64] or \"the mid- third century \u0412\u0421\u0415\" [7, 66]. He seems to have been reluctant to date 4Q52 and also 4Q70 (4QJera) earlier, and therefore assumed a very slow evolution of the script, so as not to have a large time gap with the manuscripts written in what he called the \"early Hasmonaean\" script and which he dated to ca. 150 \u0412\u0421\u0415.\nYardeni"}, {"title": "Dating ancient manuscripts using radiocarbon and AI-based writing style analysis", "authors": ["Mladen Popovi\u0107", "Maruf A.

For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date- prediction model, trained on the basis of new 14C dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the 14C-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the 14C dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79% of the samples were considered \u2018realistic' upon palaeo- graphic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The 14C ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granu- larity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date pre- diction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Radiocarbon dating", "content": "We performed 14C dating on 30 undated manuscripts from 4 sites, spanning an estimated 5 centuries: 25 from the Qumran caves, 1 from Masada, 2 from the Murabba\u02bbat caves, and 2 from the Nahal Hever caves. Twenty-eight manuscripts were made of animal skin or parchment, and 2 of papyrus.\nSamples were selected because of their script and presumed period, the manuscripts having a sufficient number of characters for Enoch to be trained, and also on the basis of practical and conservational considerations (see Section B.1 in Appendix B). One date-bearing document, Mur19, was used as a validation test for 14C, but did not go into the training of Enoch because of its cursive script.\nThe scrolls are extremely delicate material. As in the previous attempts made at dating the scrolls [19, 20], we, too, had to adjust the standard chemical AAA (Acid-Alkali-Acid) pretreatment (see Section B.2 in Appendix B). Also, many fragments are contaminated with castor oil, which scholars in the 1950s used to improve the readability of the scrolls' text [21\u201323]. This study is the first to apply, prior to 14C dating, a chemical treatment specifically designed for removing fatty materials, employing solvent extraction (see Sections B.2 and B.7.1 in Appendix B). Further specialized analytical chemistry methods were applied before and after the sample pretreatment to demonstrate that the total amount of lipid materials is below a threshold that does not significantly skew the 14C date (see Sections B.7.2\u2013B.7.5 in Appendix B).\nThe samples were dated by two Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) machines (see Section B.3 in Appendix B)."}, {"title": "2 Integration of multiple dating methods", "content": "We used 24 manuscripts from the 14C samples with accepted dates as labeled data for the primary training set for Enoch (see Sections B.4\u2013B.6 in Appendix B and Section D.2 in Appendix D). For the data labels, we used OxCal v4.4.2 [24, 25] to obtain the raw data points for the probability distributions. This is because the 14C results are not single dates, as with date- bearing documents, but represent date ranges with probability distributions. The 14C data input for training Enoch consists of the probability distributions of accepted 2-sigma (2\u03c3) calibrated ranges (see Section E.6 in Appendix E).\nIn addition to the primary training set, we created different combina- tions of training data to perform comparative analyses and further check the robustness of the model. These combinations include the tentative addition or omission of 4Q52, some previously tested 14C samples [19, 20], date-bearing documents from the fifth-fourth centuries BCE and the second century CE (see Tables I17 and I18 in Appendix I for complete lists of manuscripts), the Maresha ostracon from 176 BCE (see Section A.1 in Appendix A), and leave-one-out of the training data points."}, {"title": "2.1 Deep neural networks for detection of handwritten ink-trace patterns", "content": "The physical 24 14C-dated manuscripts are visually available on many indi- vidual images of the IAA's Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library collection [26]. We also use images from Brill Publishers [27], especially in cases where the manuscript is unavailable in the IAA collection. For this study, these images underwent multiple preprocessing measures to become suitable for pattern recognition-based techniques. It should be noted that the images are extremely difficult to work with (some examples can be seen in Figure E9 in Appendix E and Figure G22 in Appendix G; see also Section G.1 in Appendix G). We are not dealing with digitally encoded text but with pixel images of highly degraded manuscripts as input.\nWe utilize multispectral band images of each fragment and employ an in-house image fusion technique [28] to generate a three-channel image. The resulting image representation enhances ink-vs-background contrast and there- fore facilitates the effective separation of ink from backgrounds, commonly called binarization. For this purpose, we employ BiNet [28], an artificial neural network based on an encoder-decoder U-net architecture designed to binarize the diverse range of scroll images. The resulting binarized images consist solely of black foreground pixels (ink) against a white background, ensuring that subsequent analyses focus exclusively on the handwritten patterns while min- imizing inadvertent matches due to material-texture attributes. We further correct the rotation of the binarized images and divide them into multiple parts to maintain a balanced distribution of handwritten characters within each new image. No extraneous image material was used to train this binarization method.\nThus, we obtained a data set of 75 images from the 24 14C-dated manuscripts. We used 62 of these images to train Enoch. The remaining 13 images, chosen deliberately and randomly, were passed as unseen test data to cross-validate the robustness and reliability of Enoch's performance. The prediction of these 13 images by Enoch gives an 85.14% overlap to the orig- inal 14C probability distributions (see Table I16 in Appendix I). The image samples typically contain 150-200 characters, which has been shown to be sufficient for the comparable task of writer identification [29]."}, {"title": "2.2 Extracting features for style attribution", "content": "It should be noted that in this context, 'style' is not related to textual con- tent or wording. In fact, for characterizing the handwritten shapes, small shapes along the ink trace are used, largely uncoupled from the textual con- tent, because we want to avoid spurious matches or date predictions on the basis of textual content. Once the training images were available, we could perform feature extraction techniques to translate handwriting patterns into feature vectors. The feature vectors relate directly to the shape-based evi- dence of the ink traces in the manuscripts and have a solid basis in writer identification [30\u201332] and document dating [33, 34]. We extract features from both the allographic and textural levels of characters [35]. An overview of machine-learning methods can be found in [36].\nThe first, allographic, method uses a self-organized character map obtained using a Kohonen neural network. As an example, this allographic codebook feature allows for a 93% (\u00b1 \u03c3 = 2.3%) accuracy classification of the scripts 'Hasmonaean' vs. 'Herodian', using PCA, on 590 labeled manuscripts, results averaged over 32 random odd/even splits for training/testing [37]. The second, textural, method uses statistical pattern recognition on angular information. The 'hinge' method for estimating the curvature distribution has been used extensively in writer verification and dating studies [32, 33, 38]. Whereas the allographic feature addresses stylistic elements at the character level, the 'hinge' method concerns a micro-level feature directly related to the origi- nal writing activity that yielded the curvature of the ink trace. Therefore, we make a weighted combination of textural and allographic features to obtain an adjoined feature vector for each manuscript image. Such a feature vector constitutes the input data to Enoch."}, {"title": "2.3 Bayesian ridge regression", "content": "Due to the limited size of the data set, we cannot employ high-parametric models like period-specific temporal codebooks [34]. Instead, we utilize con- ditional modeling with Bayesian ridge regression [39]. This approach applies Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters for date prediction. By plac- ing a prior distribution on the parameters and updating it with observed data using Bayes' rule, we obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters and predicted dates. The Bayesian approach is chosen because our target output data represents probability curves for 14C dates (i.e., a vector) containing the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated \u2018OxCal' ranges. This probabilistic approach enables us to incorporate all available information while maintaining interpretabil- ity. Moreover, instead of producing a single number for the estimated date of a sample, it provides a comprehensive posterior distribution that allows us to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimated dates. Addition- ally, Enoch can utilize the Bayesian approach to provide error margins for predictions on unseen data."}, {"title": "2.4 Testing Enoch", "content": "Once Enoch was trained, we performed the validation by leave-one-out tests to check its performance. At this point, we took the calibrated style-based date estimation method of Enoch and applied it to a collection of 135 unseen manuscripts from the Dead Sea Scrolls as test data (see Table I15 in Appendix I).\nWe use two types of data-balancing techniques to compensate for the imbal- anced distribution of the training data over different periods. One balancing technique involves data augmentation using random elastic morphing [40] to create a balanced training data distribution. The second balancing is done on the output date predictions. This post-data-balancing uses accumulated training probabilities and training data point counts with 5%, 10%, and 20% threshold values to avoid under-sampled time regions.\nThe general recipe for Enoch's analysis of manuscript images is presented in Table 1. Before applying this to scrolls manuscripts, we tried out a known mediaeval, dated benchmark data set of charters, MPS [34], with success [41]."}, {"title": "3 14C dates and palaeographic estimates", "content": "The AMS results yielded 26 accepted 14C dates (see Sections B.4-B.6 in Appendix B), which are shown in Table B1 (Appendix B). The historical date preserved in Mur19 is consistent with the calibrated age range obtained by 14C (see Section B.4 in Appendix B). Overall, we improved and extended the existing series of 14C-dated Dead Sea Scrolls [19, 20].\nFigure 1 shows the comparison between the 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges and tra- ditional palaeographic estimates (in blue and red). This demonstrates that 17 of the 26 sampled manuscripts have whole or partial overlap, and 9 out of 26 samples yield calibrated ages that do not overlap with previous palaeographic estimates (see Appendix D).\nOverall, the 14C results indicate older date ranges for individual manuscripts as well as for the emergence of the so-called \u2018Hasmonaean' and 'Herodian' scripts. Only two manuscripts have date ranges that go in the direc- tion of a younger possible range. The 14C results for most manuscripts confirm the basic distinction between Hasmonaean-type manuscripts that are older, and Herodian-style manuscripts that are younger, and also between so-called 'Archaic' and Hasmonaean-type manuscripts.\nHowever, the 14C date ranges for manuscripts that are traditionally con- sidered Hasmonaean and Herodian are quite differently distributed across the timeline. As can be seen in Figure 1 (in blue), Hasmonaean-type manuscripts are all grouped together in a narrower part of the timeline but Herodian- type manuscripts are more spread out across the timeline, extending from the second century CE all the way back to the second century BCE (see Sections D.1.1\u2013D.1.3 in Appendix B).\nSample 4Q114 is one of the most significant findings of the 14C results. The manuscript preserves Daniel 8-11, which scholars date on literary-historical grounds to the 160s BCE [42, 43]. The accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated peak for 4Q114, 230-160 \u0412\u0421E, overlaps with the period in which the final part of the biblical book of Daniel was presumably authored (see Section D.1.2 in Appendix D)."}, {"title": "4 Validation of Enoch", "content": "Figure 1 (in green) also shows the results of cross-validation and leave-one- out tests for training Enoch. The choice for the bandwidths (2\u03c3 date ranges for 14C, 1\u03c3 uncertainties of the ridge regression for style-based predictions) is based on the intrinsic reliability of the two information sources. 14C date ranges are evidently superior to style-based predictions.\nEnoch's style-based predictions largely follow the 14C results, even though the validation samples (rows) are in no way present in the training data. In the range 300-50 BCE, Enoch's estimates provide a more fine-grained distribution than the 14C results. For samples 5/6Hev1b, Mas1k, and XHev/Se2, the style- based estimate is earlier and more uncertain. However, 11Q5 shows that in this late date range, a fairly certain style-based date estimate above 100 CE can also be achieved. This may go against historical reconstructions according to which the scrolls were hidden in the Qumran caves before the summer of 68 CE [44]. Yet, we did not impose here a chronological limit on the model, because of the 14C result for 11Q5, and in order to examine the possibility of style continuation after 70 \u0421\u0415.\nRegarding the differences between the 14C date ranges and Enoch's script style-based estimates, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 30.7 years. The MAE drops to 27.9 years when minor peaks (less than 4% in all cases except for 5.2% in 4Q2 and 9.4% in 4Q416) are ignored (see Figure H26 in Appendix H). In manuscript dating, MAE is commonly used [45] for evaluation of a regression method. The difference with rms error is limited [46]. With the chosen 2\u03c3 (14C) and 1\u03c3 (AI) bandwidths, the error for the leftmost margin is 6.4 years while for the rightmost margin it equals -38.4 years, indicating that Enoch's style- based estimate range ends earlier than the 14C range. For each sample, the date ranges of the two information sources have partial to full overlap with an average of 88.8%. For Ithaca [18], AI and epigraphy were used as two informa- tion sources to predict dates for ancient Greek inscriptions. Their prediction provides an average distance of 29.3 years from the target dating brackets, with a median distance of 3 years based on the totality of texts. We also aim for date prediction tasks, but, unlike Ithaca, we utilize three information sources: 14C, shape-based writing style analysis (AI), and palaeography.\nFigure 1 shows the general result that, on average, 14C date ranges and Enoch's predictions indicate older dates than palaeography. Only 4Q201 and 11Q5 have older palaeographic date estimates, although there is an overlap with the 14C results (see Section D.1.1 in Appendix D)."}, {"title": "5 Harvest of Enoch's date predictions for previously undated manuscripts", "content": "Table 2 summarizes Enoch's date predictions for 135 previously undated manuscripts. Expert palaeographers evaluated the style-based date predic- tions, condensing the prediction into two main categories: realistic and unrealistic, the latter subdivided into too old and too young (see Appendix G).\nAs can be seen in Table 2, 107 (79%) of the undated manuscripts were dated realistically, according to the palaeographers. Enoch's date prediction task is not a 50/50, binary decision task but regressive, with many possible years in the interval 300 BCE-200 CE. Assuming a coarseness of 25 years, as in the MPS project [34], the date range would consist of 20 bins, with a 5% prior-probability hit rate. Therefore, a success rate of 79% is unlikely to be accidental. For 21% of the manuscripts, the palaeographers judged Enoch's date predictions to be unrealistic. Enoch's 28 unrealistic predictions were divided between too old (46%) and too young (39%).\nSamples 4Q259 and 4Q319 show that Enoch can accurately find the same date estimate for the same writing styles. The accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range of 4Q259 was used to train Enoch. Images of 4Q319 were part of a test set already in 2021. 4Q259 contains text that is part of the so-called Rule of the Community. 4Q319 contains a calendrical text. Because of perceived generic differences, 4Q319 received a separate classification number but is materially actually part of the same manuscript as 4Q259 [47]. At the time of the test, 6 July 2021, this identity was not known to the AI experts. Figure 2 shows that Enoch was able to give a date prediction estimate for 4Q319 that matches the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range of 4Q259 (see Section G.5 in Appendix G)."}, {"title": "6 Discussion and conclusions", "content": "This study in style-based date prediction using the Enoch approach is a first step.

The 14C data generated in this study in combination with machine- learning-based writing style analysis enabled us to examine Aramaic/Hebrew script in individual manuscripts with an empirically based precision that was not possible before. We combined palaeography, AI, and 14C to create a date- prediction model that leads to a new chronology of the scrolls during the third century BCE until the second century CE. We give four novel insights into Aramaic/Hebrew script development during this period and the date of individual manuscripts.\nFirst, 14C date ranges and Enoch's style-based estimates are overall older than previous palaeographic estimates. These older dates for the scrolls are realistic. Hasmonaean-type manuscripts have accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges that allow for older dates in the first half of the second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier, instead of only circa 150\u201350 BCE. There are no compelling palaeographic or historical reasons that preclude these older dates as reliable time markers for the \u2018Hasmonaean' script. This also applies to the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range for 4Q70 and its \u2018Archaic' script.\nSecond, 'Herodian' script emerged earlier than previously thought. This suggests that the \u2018Hasmonaean' and \u2018Herodian' scripts were not transitioning from the mid-first century BCE onward, but that they existed next to each other at a considerably earlier date.\nThird, this novel approach of palaeography leads to a new chronology of the scrolls that impacts our understanding of the history of ancient Judaea and the people behind the scrolls. Hypotheses about whether the movement behind the scrolls originated in the second or first century BCE will need to be reconsidered in light of Enoch's second-century BCE date predictions for Hasmonaean-type manuscripts such as 1QS and 4Q163 (see Appendix G), bearing texts that are regarded typical for the movement. Scholars often assume that the rise and expansion of the Hasmonaean kingdom from the mid-second century BCE onward caused a rise in literacy and gave a push to scribal and intellectual culture. Yet, the results of this study attest to the copying of multiple literary manuscripts before this period. One example is 4Q109, a copy of the biblical book of Ecclesiastes, a book which scholars ten- tatively date to the end of the third century BCE [42], for which Enoch gives a third-century BCE date prediction (see Appendix G), close to Archaic-type manuscripts such as 4Q52 and 4Q70\u2014copies of the biblical books of Samuel and Jeremiah.\nFourth, this study's 14C result for 4Q114 and Enoch's date prediction for 4Q109 now establish these to be the first known fragments of a biblical book from the time of their presumed authors [42]. Also, Enoch's integra- tion of multiple dating methods yields a strongly improved value of sources of evidence and allows for a mutual confirmation of evidence from the two sources\u2014physical (material) and geometric (shape-based).\nThe results of this study thus dismantle unsubstantiated historical suppo- sitions and chronological limitations, and call into question the validity of the default model's relative typology. This relative typology can only be main- tained with restrictions. The spread of the Hasmonaean-type manuscripts over the timeline does not affect the default relative typology in a major way, but the older, second-century BCE date ranges of the Herodian-type manuscripts challenge the relative typology. More research is needed to solve this issue."}, {"title": "6.2 The Enoch approach to dating ancient manuscripts", "content": "To our knowledge, Enoch is the first complete machine-learning-based model that employs raw image inputs to deliver probabilistic date predictions for handwritten manuscripts utilizing the entire probability distribution from 14C output, and that is completed by palaeographic input while ensuring trans- parency and interpretability through its explainable design. Palaeographers and historians may now use Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach to palaeography as a tool to examine date predictions. The probability-based options can help in decision-making and to explicate qualitative palaeo- graphic reasoning. Also, the methods underpinning Enoch can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections.\nIt could be argued that the style-based predictions are influenced by the 14C-based training of the model. However, the leave-one-out validation results indicate that unseen samples obtain their interpolated position on the time axis based on the detected handwriting style in the images. The placement of an unseen sample on the time axis is not fundamentally constrained. Any date in the time range of 300 BCE to 200 CE could have been reached, looking at all style-based dates empirically covered by the model.\nIn this study, we have avoided using palaeographic estimates as target values for machine learning because our goal is to provide physical (material) and geometric (shape-based) evidences for manuscript dating.

Avigad [8] acknowledged this, but his caution seems to have been forgotten.\nA telling example is the estimated date of the Benei Hezir tomb inscrip- tion in Jerusalem's Kidron Valley (CIIP 137 [55]), which, according to Cross, had been dated securely, on the basis of archaeological and historical evi- dence, to the end of the first century BCE. Based on architectural typology of the Hellenistic-style fa\u00e7ade and Josephus's description of the Maccabees' family tomb in Modi\u02bbin, Avigad [56] initially suggested to date the tomb to the mid-second century BCE. He then estimated the inscription, which lists eight priests from two generations who had been interred in the tomb, to have been made on the fa\u00e7ade one or two generations after the construction of the tomb, in the first half of the first century BCE. Later, he dated the inscrip- tion palaeographically to the second half of the first century BCE, or to the Herodian period, and on that basis redated the tomb to the end of the Has- monaean period [8]. The precise length of time between the construction of the fa\u00e7ade and the writing of the inscription (how many years are one to two generations?) is a conjecture.\nAfter the 2000\u20132001 exploration of the Benei Hezir and Zechariah tombs, Barag [57] put forward new data and interpretations which would indicate that the tomb dated to the period of flourishing in Jerusalem between ca. 132/1 and 63 BCE, most likely in the first century BCE. For example, it features the new type of tombs typical of the Hasmonaean period, which became common in the first century BCE. In the same direction point correspondences with Nabataean tomb architecture (undated but supposed to go back to the first century BCE), which, Barag argued, likely inspired the Benei Hezir tomb. As for the inscription, which he conjectured to be 50-100 years younger than the construction of the tomb, he compared its writing to that of the bronze coins of the 25th year of Alexander Jannaeus (79/8) BCE, and posited that the"}]}]}

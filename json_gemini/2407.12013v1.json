For the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is particularly important. However, there is an almost complete lack of date-bearing manuscripts evenly distributed across the timeline and written in similar scripts available for palaeographic comparison. Here, we present Enoch, a state-of-the-art AI-based date-prediction model, trained on the basis of new 14C dated samples of the scrolls. Enoch uses established handwriting-style descriptors and applies Bayesian ridge regression. The challenge of this study is that the number of radiocarbon-dated manuscripts is small, while current machine learning requires an abundance of training data. We show that by using combined angular and allographic writing style feature vectors and applying Bayesian ridge regression, Enoch could predict the 14C-based dates from style, supported by leave-one-out validation, with varied MAEs of 27.9 to 30.7 years relative to the 14C dating. Enoch was then used to estimate the dates of 135 unseen manuscripts, revealing that 79% of the samples were considered \u2018realistic' upon palaeographic post-hoc evaluation. We present a new chronology of the scrolls. The 14C ranges and Enoch's style-based predictions are often older than the traditionally assumed palaeographic estimates. In the range of 300-50 BCE, Enoch's date prediction provides an improved granularity. The study is in line with current developments in multimodal machine-learning techniques, and the methods can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections. This research shows how Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach can be a tool for palaeographers and historians, re-dating ancient Jewish key texts and contributing to current debates on Jewish and Christian origins.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Radiocarbon dating", "content": "We performed 14C dating on 30 undated manuscripts from 4 sites, spanning an estimated 5 centuries: 25 from the Qumran caves, 1 from Masada, 2 from the Murabba\u02bbat caves, and 2 from the Nahal Hever caves. Twenty-eight manuscripts were made of animal skin or parchment, and 2 of papyrus.\nSamples were selected because of their script and presumed period, the manuscripts having a sufficient number of characters for Enoch to be trained, and also on the basis of practical and conservational considerations. One date-bearing document, Mur19, was used as a validation test for 14C, but did not go into the training of Enoch because of its cursive script.\nThe scrolls are extremely delicate material. As in the previous attempts made at dating the scrolls, we, too, had to adjust the standard chemical AAA (Acid-Alkali-Acid) pretreatment. Also, many fragments are contaminated with castor oil, which scholars in the 1950s used to improve the readability of the scrolls' text. This study is the first to apply, prior to 14C dating, a chemical treatment specifically designed for removing fatty materials, employing solvent extraction. Further specialized analytical chemistry methods were applied before and after the sample pretreatment to demonstrate that the total amount of lipid materials is below a threshold that does not significantly skew the 14C date.\nThe samples were dated by two Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) machines."}, {"title": "2 Integration of multiple dating methods", "content": "We used 24 manuscripts from the 14C samples with accepted dates as labeled data for the primary training set for Enoch. For the data labels, we used OxCal v4.4.2 to obtain the raw data points for the probability distributions. This is because the 14C results are not single dates, as with date-bearing documents, but represent date ranges with probability distributions.\nThe 14C data input for training Enoch consists of the probability distributions of accepted 2-sigma (2\u03c3) calibrated ranges.\nIn addition to the primary training set, we created different combinations of training data to perform comparative analyses and further check the robustness of the model. These combinations include the tentative addition or omission of 4Q52, some previously tested 14C samples, date-bearing documents from the fifth-fourth centuries BCE and the second century CE, the Maresha ostracon from 176 BCE, and leave-one-out of the training data points."}, {"title": "2.1 Deep neural networks for detection of handwritten ink-trace patterns", "content": "The physical 24 14C-dated manuscripts are visually available on many individual images of the IAA's Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library collection. We also use images from Brill Publishers, especially in cases where the manuscript is unavailable in the IAA collection. For this study, these images underwent multiple preprocessing measures to become suitable for pattern recognition-based techniques. It should be noted that the images are extremely difficult to work with (some examples can be seen in Figure E9 in Appendix E and Figure G22 in Appendix G; see also Section G.1 in Appendix G). We are not dealing with digitally encoded text but with pixel images of highly degraded manuscripts as input.\nWe utilize multispectral band images of each fragment and employ an in-house image fusion technique to generate a three-channel image. The resulting image representation enhances ink-vs-background contrast and therefore facilitates the effective separation of ink from backgrounds, commonly called binarization. For this purpose, we employ BiNet, an artificial neural network based on an encoder-decoder U-net architecture designed to binarize the diverse range of scroll images. The resulting binarized images consist solely of black foreground pixels (ink) against a white background, ensuring that subsequent analyses focus exclusively on the handwritten patterns while minimizing inadvertent matches due to material-texture attributes. We further correct the rotation of the binarized images and divide them into multiple parts to maintain a balanced distribution of handwritten characters within each new image. No extraneous image material was used to train this binarization method.\nThus, we obtained a data set of 75 images from the 24 14C-dated manuscripts. We used 62 of these images to train Enoch. The remaining 13 images, chosen deliberately and randomly, were passed as unseen test data to cross-validate the robustness and reliability of Enoch's performance. The prediction of these 13 images by Enoch gives an 85.14% overlap to the original 14C probability distributions."}, {"title": "2.2 Extracting features for style attribution", "content": "It should be noted that in this context, 'style' is not related to textual content or wording. In fact, for characterizing the handwritten shapes, small shapes along the ink trace are used, largely uncoupled from the textual content, because we want to avoid spurious matches or date predictions on the basis of textual content. Once the training images were available, we could perform feature extraction techniques to translate handwriting patterns into feature vectors. The feature vectors relate directly to the shape-based evidence of the ink traces in the manuscripts and have a solid basis in writer identification and document dating. We extract features from both the allographic and textural levels of characters. An overview of machine-learning methods can be found in.\nThe first, allographic, method uses a self-organized character map obtained using a Kohonen neural network. As an example, this allographic codebook feature allows for a 93% (\u00b1 \u03c3 = 2.3%) accuracy classification of the scripts 'Hasmonaean' vs. 'Herodian', using PCA, on 590 labeled manuscripts, results averaged over 32 random odd/even splits for training/testing. The second, textural, method uses statistical pattern recognition on angular information. The 'hinge' method for estimating the curvature distribution has been used extensively in writer verification and dating studies. Whereas the allographic feature addresses stylistic elements at the character level, the 'hinge' method concerns a micro-level feature directly related to the original writing activity that yielded the curvature of the ink trace. Therefore, we make a weighted combination of textural and allographic features to obtain an adjoined feature vector for each manuscript image. Such a feature vector constitutes the input data to Enoch."}, {"title": "2.3 Bayesian ridge regression", "content": "Due to the limited size of the data set, we cannot employ high-parametric models like period-specific temporal codebooks. Instead, we utilize conditional modeling with Bayesian ridge regression. This approach applies Bayesian inference to estimate model parameters for date prediction. By placing a prior distribution on the parameters and updating it with observed data using Bayes' rule, we obtain the posterior distribution of the parameters and predicted dates. The Bayesian approach is chosen because our target output data represents probability curves for 14C dates (i.e., a vector) containing the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated \u2018OxCal' ranges. This probabilistic approach enables us to incorporate all available information while maintaining interpretability. Moreover, instead of producing a single number for the estimated date of a sample, it provides a comprehensive posterior distribution that allows us to assess the uncertainty associated with the estimated dates. Additionally, Enoch can utilize the Bayesian approach to provide error margins for predictions on unseen data."}, {"title": "2.4 Testing Enoch", "content": "Once Enoch was trained, we performed the validation by leave-one-out tests to check its performance. At this point, we took the calibrated style-based date estimation method of Enoch and applied it to a collection of 135 unseen manuscripts from the Dead Sea Scrolls as test data.\nWe use two types of data-balancing techniques to compensate for the imbalanced distribution of the training data over different periods. One balancing technique involves data augmentation using random elastic morphing to create a balanced training data distribution. The second balancing is done on the output date predictions. This post-data-balancing uses accumulated training probabilities and training data point counts with 5%, 10%, and 20% threshold values to avoid under-sampled time regions.\nThe general recipe for Enoch's analysis of manuscript images is presented in Table 1. Before applying this to scrolls manuscripts, we tried out a known mediaeval, dated benchmark data set of charters, MPS, with success."}, {"title": "3 14C dates and palaeographic estimates", "content": "The AMS results yielded 26 accepted 14C dates, which are shown in Table B1 (Appendix B). The historical date preserved in Mur19 is consistent with the calibrated age range obtained by 14C. Overall, we improved and extended the existing series of 14C-dated Dead Sea Scrolls.\nFigure 1 shows the comparison between the 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges and traditional palaeographic estimates (in blue and red). This demonstrates that 17 of the 26 sampled manuscripts have whole or partial overlap, and 9 out of 26 samples yield calibrated ages that do not overlap with previous palaeographic estimates.\nOverall, the 14C results indicate older date ranges for individual manuscripts as well as for the emergence of the so-called \u2018Hasmonaean' and 'Herodian' scripts. Only two manuscripts have date ranges that go in the direction of a younger possible range. The 14C results for most manuscripts confirm the basic distinction between Hasmonaean-type manuscripts that are older, and Herodian-style manuscripts that are younger, and also between so-called 'Archaic' and Hasmonaean-type manuscripts.\nHowever, the 14C date ranges for manuscripts that are traditionally considered Hasmonaean and Herodian are quite differently distributed across the timeline. As can be seen in Figure 1 (in blue), Hasmonaean-type manuscripts are all grouped together in a narrower part of the timeline but Herodian-type manuscripts are more spread out across the timeline, extending from the second century CE all the way back to the second century BCE"}, {"title": "4 Validation of Enoch", "content": "Figure 1 (in green) also shows the results of cross-validation and leave-one-out tests for training Enoch. The choice for the bandwidths (2\u03c3 date ranges for 14C, 1\u03c3 uncertainties of the ridge regression for style-based predictions) is based on the intrinsic reliability of the two information sources. 14C date ranges are evidently superior to style-based predictions.\nEnoch's style-based predictions largely follow the 14C results, even though the validation samples (rows) are in no way present in the training data. In the range 300-50 BCE, Enoch's estimates provide a more fine-grained distribution than the 14C results. For samples 5/6Hevlb, Maslk, and XHev/Se2, the style-based estimate is earlier and more uncertain. However, 11Q5 shows that in this late date range, a fairly certain style-based date estimate above 100 CE can also be achieved. This may go against historical reconstructions according to which the scrolls were hidden in the Qumran caves before the summer of 68 CE. Yet, we did not impose here a chronological limit on the model, because of the 14C result for 11Q5, and in order to examine the possibility of style continuation after 70 \u0421\u0415.\nRegarding the differences between the 14C date ranges and Enoch's script style-based estimates, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 30.7 years. The MAE drops to 27.9 years when minor peaks (less than 4% in all cases except for 5.2% in 4Q2 and 9.4% in 4Q416) are ignored (see Figure H26 in Appendix H). In manuscript dating, MAE is commonly used for evaluation of a regression method. The difference with rms error is limited. With the chosen 2\u03c3 (14C) and 1\u03c3 (AI) bandwidths, the error for the leftmost margin is 6.4 years while for the rightmost margin it equals -38.4 years, indicating that Enoch's style-based estimate range ends earlier than the 14C range. For each sample, the date ranges of the two information sources have partial to full overlap with an average of 88.8%. For Ithaca, AI and epigraphy were used as two information sources to predict dates for ancient Greek inscriptions. Their prediction provides an average distance of 29.3 years from the target dating brackets, with a median distance of 3 years based on the totality of texts. We also aim for date prediction tasks, but, unlike Ithaca, we utilize three information sources: 14C, shape-based writing style analysis (AI), and palaeography.\nFigure 1 shows the general result that, on average, 14C date ranges and Enoch's predictions indicate older dates than palaeography. Only 4Q201 and 11Q5 have older palaeographic date estimates, although there is an overlap with the 14C results."}, {"title": "5 Harvest of Enoch's date predictions for previously undated manuscripts", "content": null}, {"title": "6 Discussion and conclusions", "content": "This study in style-based date prediction using the Enoch approach is a first step. The 14C data generated in this study in combination with machine-learning-based writing style analysis enabled us to examine Aramaic/Hebrew script in individual manuscripts with an empirically based precision that was not possible before. We combined palaeography, AI, and 14C to create a date-prediction model that leads to a new chronology of the scrolls during the third century BCE until the second century CE. We give four novel insights into Aramaic/Hebrew script development during this period and the date of individual manuscripts."}, {"title": "6.1 Aramaic/Hebrew script development in ancient Judaea", "content": "First, 14C date ranges and Enoch's style-based estimates are overall older than previous palaeographic estimates. These older dates for the scrolls are realistic. Hasmonaean-type manuscripts have accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated ranges that allow for older dates in the first half of the second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier, instead of only circa 150-50 BCE. There are no compelling palaeographic or historical reasons that preclude these older dates as reliable time markers for the \u2018Hasmonaean' script. This also applies to the accepted 2\u03c3 calibrated range for 4Q70 and its \u2018Archaic' script.\nSecond, 'Herodian' script emerged earlier than previously thought. This suggests that the \u2018Hasmonaean' and \u2018Herodian' scripts were not transitioning from the mid-first century BCE onward, but that they existed next to each other at a considerably earlier date.\nThird, this novel approach of palaeography leads to a new chronology of the scrolls that impacts our understanding of the history of ancient Judaea and the people behind the scrolls. Hypotheses about whether the movement behind the scrolls originated in the second or first century BCE will need to be reconsidered in light of Enoch's second-century BCE date predictions for Hasmonaean-type manuscripts such as 1QS and 4Q163 bearing texts that are regarded typical for the movement. Scholars often assume that the rise and expansion of the Hasmonaean kingdom from the mid-second century BCE onward caused a rise in literacy and gave a push to scribal and intellectual culture. Yet, the results of this study attest to the copying of multiple literary manuscripts before this period. One example is 4Q109, a copy of the biblical book of Ecclesiastes, a book which scholars tentatively date to the end of the third century BCE, for which Enoch gives a third-century BCE date prediction, close to Archaic-type manuscripts such as 4Q52 and 4Q70\u2014copies of the biblical books of Samuel and Jeremiah.\nFourth, this study's 14C result for 4Q114 and Enoch's date prediction for 4Q109 now establish these to be the first known fragments of a biblical book from the time of their presumed authors. Also, Enoch's integration of multiple dating methods yields a strongly improved value of sources of evidence and allows for a mutual confirmation of evidence from the two sources physical (material) and geometric (shape-based).\nThe results of this study thus dismantle unsubstantiated historical suppositions and chronological limitations, and call into question the validity of the default model's relative typology. This relative typology can only be maintained with restrictions. The spread of the Hasmonaean-type manuscripts over the timeline does not affect the default relative typology in a major way, but the older, second-century BCE date ranges of the Herodian-type manuscripts challenge the relative typology. More research is needed to solve this issue."}, {"title": "6.2 The Enoch approach to dating ancient manuscripts", "content": "To our knowledge, Enoch is the first complete machine-learning-based model that employs raw image inputs to deliver probabilistic date predictions for handwritten manuscripts utilizing the entire probability distribution from 14C output, and that is completed by palaeographic input while ensuring transparency and interpretability through its explainable design. Palaeographers and historians may now use Enoch's quantitative, probability-based approach to palaeography as a tool to examine date predictions. The probability-based options can help in decision-making and to explicate qualitative palaeographic reasoning. Also, the methods underpinning Enoch can be used for date prediction in other partially-dated manuscript collections.\nIt could be argued that the style-based predictions are influenced by the 14C-based training of the model. However, the leave-one-out validation results indicate that unseen samples obtain their interpolated position on the time axis based on the detected handwriting style in the images. The placement of an unseen sample on the time axis is not fundamentally constrained. Any date in the time range of 300 BCE to 200 CE could have been reached, looking at all style-based dates empirically covered by the model.\nIn this study, we have avoided using palaeographic estimates as target values for machine learning because our goal is to provide physical (material) and geometric (shape-based) evidences for manuscript dating. While the use of palaeographic estimates as target values for machine learning is technically possible, we consider it too risky, given the existing uncertainties and lack of consensus associated with the precise dating of individual manuscripts."}, {"title": "7 Online content", "content": "All data, code, and test film associated with this article are publicly available on Zenodo with the following DOIs:"}, {"title": "8 Supplementary information", "content": "This article has ten supplementary materials:"}, {"title": "Appendix A The dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls", "content": "There is broad agreement in scholarship about the long-term lines of development of Aramaic and Hebrew script in Judaea from the fourth century BCE until the second century CE as an evolution from imperial Aramaic chancery script of the fourth century BCE to what became the dominant Jewish square script in the first and second centuries CE. However, when we zoom into the specifics of the centuries in between, the finer typological and chronological distinctions\u2014misleadingly connected with historical-political eras\u2014are not reliably grounded in the data; rather, they rely on so-called absolute pegs that are not absolute at all and on unsubstantiated suppositions about historical processes that would have influenced palaeographic developments.\nThe main problem is that there is a palaeographic gap between the third century BCE and the second century CE. There is a lack of absolute dates across the time period of the scrolls."}, {"title": "A.1 Too few date-bearing manuscripts to compare with", "content": "Palaeographic comparison of undated and dated manuscripts with a similar script is not possible. Only few date-bearing manuscripts have survived and those are at the outer limits of the date range. The oldest, from fourth-century BCE Wadi Daliyeh and fourth-century BCE Bactria, have script comparable to only one or two manuscripts, 4Q52 and 4Q70 but not the vast majority of the scrolls. The manuscripts from fifth-century BCE Elephantine are even further away in time.\nThe youngest, from first- and second-century CE Murabba\u02bbat and Nahal Hever, are mostly in cursive script and cannot be used to compare and date the vast majority of the Hebrew and Aramaic scrolls written in more formal scripts. Those dated manuscripts include about 30 documentary texts, mainly from Murabba\u02bbat and Nahal Hever. From the same period are 15 undated but datable letters, mostly in cursive script, to and from Simon bar Kokhba, the leader of the revolt against the Romans in 132\u2013135 CE. Dated documents written in formal or bookhand script are limited to a farming contract from Murabba\u02bbat (Mur24) and three leases of land from Nahal Hever (5/6Hev 44, 45, 46), from 133 and 134 CE.\nOnly one dated ostracon, from 176 BCE from Maresha is known from the crucial period between the third century BCE and the first century CE. Another ostracon, from Khirbet el-Qom, is partially dated, and could date from 277, 241, or 217/6 BCE. Yet, these can hardly be used for dating formal hands, and cannot even serve as an indicative time marker to tie in manuscripts with a semicursive handwriting."}, {"title": "A.2 Weak workarounds", "content": "The way taken by Cross and others around the lack of date-bearing documents in formal, semiformal, or semicursive script from the third century BCE until the first century CE does not solve the problem. The relative development and absolute chronology of the scrolls' palaeography was determined by taking recourse to a combination of a. supposed absolute pegs and b. unsubstantiated palaeographic and historical suppositions:"}, {"title": "A.2.1 Not so absolute time markers", "content": "Cross claimed that his model was pegged by a series of absolute datings, in scores if not hundreds of documents inscribed on a variety of materials, especially from the late first century BCE and first century CE. Puech provided additional pegs, specifically for the less formal Hasmonaean hands. Cross and Puech relied on inscriptions on other surfaces such as stone and metal, but here too there are no absolute dates, not even for the most important pegs, such as the Benei Hezir tomb and the Jason's tomb inscriptions. Avigad acknowledged this, but his caution seems to have been forgotten.\nA telling example is the estimated date of the Benei Hezir tomb inscription in Jerusalem's Kidron Valley, which, according to Cross, had been dated securely, on the basis of archaeological and historical evidence, to the end of the first century BCE. Based on architectural typology of the Hellenistic-style fa\u00e7ade and Josephus's description of the Maccabees' family tomb in Modi\u02bbin, Avigad initially suggested to date the tomb to the mid-second century BCE. He then estimated the inscription, which lists eight priests from two generations who had been interred in the tomb, to have been made on the fa\u00e7ade one or two generations after the construction of the tomb, in the first half of the first century BCE. Later, he dated the inscription palaeographically to the second half of the first century BCE, or to the Herodian period, and on that basis redated the tomb to the end of the Hasmonaean period. The precise length of time between the construction of the fa\u00e7ade and the writing of the inscription (how many years are one to two generations?) is a conjecture.\nAfter the 2000\u20132001 exploration of the Benei Hezir and Zechariah tombs, Barag put forward new data and interpretations which would indicate that the tomb dated to the period of flourishing in Jerusalem between ca. 132/1 and 63 BCE, most likely in the first century BCE. For example, it features the new type of tombs typical of the Hasmonaean period, which became common in the first century BCE. In the same direction point correspondences with Nabataean tomb architecture (undated but supposed to go back to the first century BCE), which, Barag argued, likely inspired the Benei Hezir tomb. As for the inscription, which he conjectured to be 50-100 years younger than the construction of the tomb, he compared its writing to that of the bronze coins of the 25th year of Alexander Jannaeus (79/8) BCE, and posited that the script of the Benei Hezir inscription would seem to be slightly later, from the late Hasmonaean or early Herodian period.\nWithout mentioning the Benei Hezir inscription, Naveh had identified the script on the Alexander Jannaeus coinage as \u2018vulgar semiformal' and saw its closest parallels to the letters found on ossuaries. Cross had described this style as a \u201ccrude simplified derivative\u201d of the formal Herodian hand. Naveh's aligning of the letters of the coins with those of the ossuaries might suggest that this type of Herodian hand was already anticipated by the Jannaeus coins. Naveh therefore referred to the palaeographical significance of these coins. One should note, however, that neither Naveh nor Barag carefully analysed the letters of the coins.\nSummarizing, all scholars associate the Benei Hezir tomb with the Maccabees or the Hasmonaean period (either early or late), and date its inscription to the first century BCE. Yet, Cross's claim that a late first-century BCE date is secure and an absolute peg, cannot be sustained. The date estimates of the tomb and its inscriptions are not only based on architectural typology, but also on the palaeographic typology. None of the evidence argues against a mid-first century BCE or even earlier date of the inscription.\nThis is one example to demonstrate that inscriptions in Hebrew and Aramaic on other surfaces, such as stone and metal, cannot fill the void of absolute dating pegs between the third century BCE until the first century CE. In addition to the Benei Hezir burial inscription, this applies also, for example, to the so-called Queen Helena inscription and Uzziah plaque from the first century CE. Strictly speaking, these are not absolutely dated. The same applies to the Jason's tomb inscriptions , the date of which is not fixed either. Puech had initially argued on the basis of his reconstruction of the historical background of the inscriptions that the main one in Aramaic (CIIP 392) must be dated to 82/1 BCE, but more recently he stated that the Aramaic inscription dates palaeographically to about the middle of the first century BCE or slightly earlier. Yet, Yardeni dated the inscription shortly before the destruction of the tomb by an earthquake in 31 BCE.\nAnother example are the hundreds of ossuary inscriptions, which Cross said to virtually all belong to the Herodian era. A post-20/15 BCE date for the ossuaries may be archaeologically correct, but the political and historical framing to the Herodian period does not limit the emergence of the script exhibited on the ossuaries to that period. The question when the so-called Herodian script came into being is decided somewhat arbitrarily. Cross took 30 BCE, Milik and Baillet 50 BCE. Avigad also took 50 BCE or slightly earlier. Furthermore, Avigad already acknowledged that scrolls referred to as 'Herodian' may easily be earlier than this period. In other words, even for the 'Herodian' script, just as for the 'Hasmonaean' script (see below), the emergence is difficult to establish. In terms of typological development, we have to reckon with the possibility of longer, broader time frames for both scripts."}, {"title": "A.2.2 Unsubstantiated palaeographic and historical premises", "content": "Even if one were to accept Cross's recourse to a series of absolute datings, these would support mainly late first-century BCE and first-century CE comparisons. They do not help to establish the beginnings of the \u2018Hasmonaean' script. Lacking dated material from the third and second centuries BCE, Cross had to take further recourse to two premises to attempt to establish the upper range of the oldest scripts, \u2018Archaic' and \u2018Hasmonaean', from the scrolls, and to limit the earliest dating of the scrolls mainly to the second century BCE, with only a few exceptions for older \u2018Archaic' manuscripts such as 4Q52 and 4Q70.\nIn addition to a lack of time markers, two palaeographic and historical premises by Cross, Yardeni and others stand out: a slow development of the Aramaic/Hebrew script in the early Hellenistic period (third century BCE); and the emergence of a national script as a watershed around 200-150 \u0412\u0421\u0415.\nThe presumed slow development of the Aramaic/Hebrew script in the early Hellenistic period is not supported by any dated evidence of that period. The assumption was in part based on a few undated cursive Aramaic papyri from Egypt containing Greek names (hence assumed to be from the third century BCE), but the later discovery of the dated Wadi Daliyeh papyri showed that there were different lines of development, some having taken place much earlier, thus challenging the premise of the slow development, and reducing the importance of those Hellenistic Egyptian Aramaic papyri for establishing the evolution of the Aramaic/Hebrew script. For Judaea, Cross also referred in passing to a conservative palaeography for the copying of sacred texts, but without further explanation or supporting evidence.\nCross initially dated 4Q52 (4QSamb) to \"the last quarter of the third century B.C.\", \u201cno doubt late in the century\", but after the discovery of the Wadi Daliyeh manuscripts, simply to \"ca. 250 B.C.\" or \u201cthe mid-third century \u0412\u0421\u0415\u201d. He seems to have been reluctant to date 4Q52 and also 4Q70 (4QJera) earlier, and therefore assumed a very slow evolution of the script, so as not to have a large time gap with the manuscripts written in what he called the \u201cearly Hasmonaean\u201d script and which he dated to ca. 150 \u0412\u0421\u0415.\nYardeni, too, regarded 4Q52 and 4Q70 as examples of a transitional stage from the fourth and third century BCE Aramaic script in the direction of the \u2018Hasmonaean' script. Her conclusion that these two manuscripts could therefore be dated to the late third or early second century BCE seems to be based rather on the supposed proximity to this national script than on the correspondences with the earlier Aramaic scripts.\nHowever, the palaeographic principle is to date an undated manuscript by comparing its script to that of dated writings with a similar script. This means that the oldest manuscript of the scrolls, 4Q52, must be compared to the Aramaic evidence from Wadi Daliyeh from the fourth century BCE. 4Q52 should then be chronologically closer to those manuscripts, especially WDSP 1 (335 \u0412\u0421\u0415)."}, {"title": "A.3 The way out of the gap", "content": "Summarizing, the dating problem of the Dead Sea Scrolls, due to the absence of calendar dates, is further confounded by the fact that there are no other date-bearing manuscripts in similar script available for palaeographic comparison. This lack of date-bearing documents cannot be overcome by using inscriptions on other surfaces instead because these, too, have no absolute dates. Also, datable inscriptions mainly date from the first century BCE and first century CE and thus cannot shed light on script developments in the third and second centuries BCE. Historical premises and assumptions remain unsubstantiated and devoid of factual support, and they fail to support a chronological framework for the palaeography and the manuscript evidence. These assumptions cannot determine or sufficiently constrain the dates connected to the writing of the scrolls.\nTherefore, 14C dates derived from manuscript samples are needed as absolute time markers to lead the way out of the palaeographic gap. In the absence of an abundance of date-bearing manuscripts written in similar script available for palaeographic comparison, 14C dating, a scientific measurement (\u201cyard-stick of time\u201d), provides more reliable time markers, and in combination with our style-based date-prediction model Enoch even more precise time markers."}, {"title": "Appendix B Radiocarbon dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls", "content": "Two series of Dead Sea Scrolls were radiocarbon dated in the 1990s, in Zurich and in Tucson, Arizona .

Furthermore, since then, radiocarbon dating methods and procedures have improved significantly in terms of better calibration, higher precision obtained by more modern methods and instruments, and also more effective cleaning procedures for dealing with contaminated samples.\nIn this study, we have taken the following analytical steps for the samples:\n1. They were precleaned by a Soxhlet procedure in Odense\n2. Subsequently, they were further pretreated by standard methods in Groningen\n3. The cleaned samples were dated by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) in Groningen\n4. During the study, the residual lipids in the extracts of all 30 samples after the Soxhlet cleaning were analysed, and 17 samples have been further investigated by specialized analytical chemistry methods in Pisa regarding the nature of the contamination"}, {"title": "B.1 Selection of Samples", "content": "The 30 samples we received from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) were selected on the basis of script and presumed period so as to obtain reliable time markers in the palaeographic gap between the fourth century BCE and the second century CE. We made this selection at the start of the project on the basis of the default model in the field. The dates associated with the manuscripts according to this traditional model provided balanced coverage of the timeline under investigation. Also, because the 14C dates are needed to go into the date-prediction model, we selected manuscripts that contain a sufficient number of characters in their extant material,. The manuscript identity and presumed palaeographic periods of the samples were not known to the staff of the laboratories in Groningen, Odense, and Pisa at the time of the measurement. One of the 30 samples, from a date-bearing document (Mur19), was added as a control text. Its identity and date were"}]}

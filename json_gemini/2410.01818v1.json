As AI becomes increasingly central to banking operations, its\nenergy-intensive processes contribute significantly to carbon emissions, posing environmental, reg-\nlatory, and reputational risks. Regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act, Corporate Sustain-\nability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD),\nand the Prudential Regulation Authority's SS1/23 are driving banks to incorporate environmental\nconsiderations into their AI model governance. Recent advancements in AI research, like the Open\nMixture-of-Experts (OLMOE) framework and the Agentic RAG framework, offer more efficient and\ndynamic AI models, reducing their carbon footprint without compromising performance. Using\nthese technological examples, the paper outlines a structured approach for banks to identify, as-\nsess, and mitigate Al's carbon footprint within their RMFs, including adopting energy-efficient\nmodels, utilising green cloud computing, and implementing lifecycle management. The paper also\nemphasises cross-departmental collaboration within banks and the use of respective enabling tools\nsuch as the GHG Protocol Toolkit for carbon accounting and Fairlearn for AI fairness assessment.\nBuilding on the experts' opinions, such as UNEP FI, we argue that targeting alignment with the\nglobal standards and directives like IFRS, ESRS, and GFANZ, banks can enhance their sustainabil-\nity reporting and model governance, ensuring long-term resilience. By effectively integrating these\npractices into their RMFs, banks can navigate the regulatory landscape, mitigate environmen-\ntal risks, and promote a sustainable future in banking, balancing innovation with environmental\nresponsibility.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The banking sector is increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations to improve\nefficiency, customer service, risk management, and overall operational effectiveness [Com22, Fed22]. AI\nsystems power critical banking functions, from customer service chatbots and credit scoring algorithms\nto fraud detection and automated financial advice. However, the growing reliance on AI brings with\nit a significant environmental cost [SGM19]. The training, deployment, and ongoing operation of\nAI systems consume large amounts of energy, contributing to a substantial carbon footprint. In the\ncontext of the banking sector, this environmental impact presents a new dimension of risk that must\nbe managed alongside traditional financial and operational risks.\nTo address these questions, recent AI research has branched into three additional areas of responsi-\nble AI, notably: ways of enhancing computational efficiency, complementarity of language models with\nsmarter frameworks, and development of agentic models for more dynamic workflows. These advances\nhave the potential to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI by making models more efficient and adapt-\nable. From the regulatory perspective, UK Prudential Regulation Authority's SS1/23 [0E24, CB24] has\nemphasised the need for banks to enhance model governance and oversight, indirectly influencing the"}, {"title": "Understanding the Carbon Footprint of AI", "content": "AI's carbon footprint stems primarily from its energy-intensive processes [Fed22]. Large-scale AI\nmodels, especially those using deep learning techniques, require significant computational power for\ntraining and deployment. Training complex models involves processing vast amounts of data, often\nusing high-performance hardware like graphics processing units (GPUs) in data centres. This process\ncan consume more energy than entire countries in some cases. For instance, training a single deep\nlearning model can produce as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes [Hao19]. In the banking\nsector, where AI models must often be retrained and updated to remain accurate and compliant\nwith evolving regulations like SS1/23, this energy consumption can be a continuous source of carbon\nemissions.\nThe operational deployment of AI systems in customer banking, such as real-time fraud detection,\ncredit scoring, and automated customer service, further contributes to the carbon footprint. These\nsystems require ongoing data processing and computational resources, resulting in a persistent energy\ndemand. Additionally, the infrastructure supporting these AI applications, including data storage\nand cloud services, adds to the overall energy consumption. When scaled across an entire banking\ninstitution, the cumulative carbon footprint of AI can become significant, offsetting the potential\nefficiency gains that these systems provide [ea22, ea24b].\nRecent research in AI has sought to address this issue by focusing on enhancing computational\nefficiency. For instance, the Open Mixture-of-Experts (OLMoE)\u00b9 framework, developed by the Allen\nInstitute of AI, uses a sparse mixture-of-experts approach, activating only a subset of parameters\nduring model inference. This technique achieves up to sevenfold efficiency gains over dense models\nwhile maintaining or even exceeding performance. Similarly, OneGen\u00b2 introduces a unified architecture\nfor generation and retrieval tasks, reducing inference time and costs while improving task performance.\nAnother advancement, Feature Sampling and Partial Alignment Distillation (FSPAD), accelerates\nlanguage model inference by up to 13.3% and enables smaller models like LLaMA 3.1 to outperform\nlarger models like GPT-4. These innovations reflect a growing trend towards more efficient AI models,\nwhich is crucial for reducing the carbon footprint associated with AI operations in banking and finance\n[TF18, IMF22, LG24].\nRecognizing the environmental impact of AI is critical not only for regulatory compliance but also\nfor aligning with broader corporate sustainability goals. We therefore put forward the proposition that\nthe carbon footprint of AI must be considered alongside the positive contributions of AI to efficiency\nand customer service to achieve a holistic view of the banks' environmental impacts. Incorporating\nAI's carbon footprint into the RMFs of banks is thus a strategic imperative to address environmental\nrisks, comply with regulatory standards, and maintain the bank's reputation as a responsible corporate\ncitizen [PH20]."}, {"title": "Incorporating AI's Carbon Footprint into RMFs", "content": "Building on the well-documented best practices, it can be argued that incorporating the carbon\nfootprint of AI into the risk management frameworks of banks can involve several steps, from risk\nidentification and assessment to the development and implementation of mitigation strategies. This\nprocess must be integrated with the bank's existing risk management practices to ensure a cohesive\napproach to managing all dimensions of risk, including environmental, operational, and regulatory\nrisks [Sun23, Com24b].\nThe first step in including AI's carbon footprint in the RMF is risk identification [ea24a]. This\nusually involves recognising the potential environmental risks associated with the deployment and\noperation of AI systems. Direct risks include the high energy consumption associated with training\nand running AI models, which contributes to carbon emissions and climate change. The more complex\nand data-intensive the AI model, the greater its energy consumption and carbon footprint. In the\ncontext of banking, AI systems used for credit scoring, fraud detection, and customer service are likely\nto be among the most energy-intensive due to the need for real-time processing and high accuracy.\nAdditionally, SS1/23's emphasis on model governance requires banks to identify the environmental\nrisks associated with their models, prompting them to include considerations of energy efficiency and\ncarbon emissions as part of their overall risk management strategy [oE24, CB24].\nIn addition to direct environmental risks, banks must also consider regulatory risks. With the\nintroduction of regulations such as the CSRD, the CSDDD, and SS1/23, banks face the risk of non-\ncompliance if they fail to adequately measure, disclose, and mitigate the environmental impact of\ntheir AI systems [Com24b]. The CSDDD sets the stage for stronger corporate accountability and\nsustainability in the EU, requiring companies to conduct due diligence on the environmental and\nsocial impacts of their operations. The latest CDP Policy Explainer [CDP24] provides a detailed\nroadmap for banks to address these CSDDD requirements and align them with CDP disclosures,\nincluding the carbon footprint of AI. The guide covers climate transition plans in alignment with\nglobal standards such as IFRS S2, ESRS, SEC, GRI, and GFANZ, highlighting clear transition plan\nelements like governance, scenario analysis, risk management, strategy, financial planning, and target\nsetting. SS1/23 complements this by urging banks to incorporate environmental metrics into their\nmodel risk assessments, ensuring that banks evaluate their AI models not only for performance and\nrobustness but also for their sustainability impact [ea21, Ama24, BRB23, GT20].\nBy integrating Al's carbon footprint into their RMFs, banks can align their practices with these\nstandards and frameworks [Ban21b]. The CDP Policy Explainer emphasises actionable insights across\ngovernance to value chain engagement, providing a clear path for banks to report on their climate\nrisks, opportunities, and progress. This not only ensures compliance with CSDDD requirements but\nalso helps banks stay ahead of the regulatory curve by demonstrating a commitment to sustainability\nand responsible AI use.\nOnce the risks have been identified, the next step is to assess and measure the carbon footprint\nof AI within the RMF. This involves quantifying the emissions associated with AI models throughout\ntheir lifecycle, from development and training to deployment and maintenance. To facilitate this\nprocess, banks can leverage carbon accounting tools such as the GHG Protocol Toolkit and OpenLCA\n[Ini20, Ope21]. These tools enable banks to calculate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated\nby their AI systems, providing a concrete measure of the environmental impact. Metrics such as energy\nconsumption per transaction, carbon emissions per AI model, and the total carbon footprint of AI-\nrelated activities can be used as key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring the environmental\nimpact. In line with SS1/23, banks must also include these environmental metrics in their model risk\nassessment processes, treating carbon emissions as a specific risk category alongside traditional risk\nmetrics.\nIn addition to using carbon accounting tools, banks can conduct scenario analysis to understand\nhow different AI deployment strategies affect their overall carbon footprint [Ban21b]. For instance,\nbanks can evaluate the impact of using more energy-efficient AI models or shifting AI processing to\ncloud providers that use renewable energy sources. Innovations such as OLMOE, OneGen, and FSPAD\npresent opportunities for banks to reduce their carbon footprint by implementing more computationally\nefficient models. By analysing various scenarios, banks can also identify strategies that minimise\nthe carbon footprint while still achieving operational and business objectives. The CSDDD, CDP\nframeworks, and SS1/23 all offer guidance on how to incorporate scenario analysis into transition\nplans, emphasising the importance of assessing climate-related risks and opportunities within the"}, {"title": "Aligning with Regulatory Requirements", "content": "Aligning the incorporation of AI's carbon footprint in RMFs with regulatory requirements is critical\nfor ensuring compliance and avoiding legal and reputational risks. The CSRD requires banks to dis-\nclose the environmental impacts of their operations, including the use of AI systems. By including the\ncarbon footprint of AI in their RMFs, banks can ensure that they meet CSRD's sustainability disclo-\nsure requirements. This involves reporting on key environmental metrics such as energy consumption,\ncarbon emissions, and the measures taken to reduce the carbon footprint of AI systems. These dis-\nclosures should be integrated into the bank's broader sustainability reporting, providing stakeholders\nwith a transparent view of the bank's environmental performance [Sca24].\nThe CSDDD further strengthens corporate accountability by requiring companies to conduct due\ndiligence on the environmental and social impacts of their operations. By including the carbon footprint\nof AI in their RMFs, banks can conduct the necessary due diligence to identify, prevent, and mitigate\nenvironmental risks associated with AI deployment. Mentioned before in this paper, the CDP Policy\nExplainer provides a roadmap for aligning with the CSDDD and global standards, including IFRS,\nESRS, and GFANZ. By following this roadmap, banks can ensure that their climate transition plans\naddress critical elements such as governance, scenario analysis, risk management, strategy, financial\nplanning, and target setting [Com23].\nIn addition to CSRD and CSDDD compliance, the EU AI Act [Com22] imposes specific obligations\non the deployment of AI systems, particularly those classified as high-risk. The Act requires banks\nto ensure that their AI systems are used ethically and sustainably, with a focus on transparency and\naccountability. Banks must include carbon footprint assessments in their AI audits to comply with\nthe Act's provisions. This involves documenting the environmental impact of AI systems, particularly\nthose used in critical functions such as credit scoring and fraud detection. By conducting regular AI\naudits that include carbon footprint assessments, banks can demonstrate their commitment to ethical\nAI use and sustainable practices. SS1/23 complements these regulatory requirements by promoting\nrobust model governance and risk management practices that include environmental considerations,\nthereby ensuring that banks maintain sustainable AI models aligned with regulatory standards.\nThe alignment of the RMF with these regulatory requirements also involves cross-departmental col-\nlaboration within the bank [AC24, McC24, SS24, RAK24]. To effectively include AI's carbon footprint\nin the RMF, banks must foster collaboration between AI, sustainability, and risk management teams.\nAI and data science teams are responsible for developing and implementing energy-efficient AI models,\ntracking the carbon footprint, and integrating sustainability considerations into AI development prac-\ntices. Sustainability teams oversee the bank's sustainability reporting, set carbon reduction targets\nfor AI systems, and ensure alignment with CSRD, CSDDD, SS1/23, and the bank's ESG goals. Risk\nmanagement teams are responsible for incorporating AI's carbon footprint into the RMF, conducting\nregular risk assessments, and monitoring compliance with sustainability regulations.\nCross-departmental collaboration is facilitated by using advanced tools and technologies. For ex-\nample, OxonFair [Del24] by Oxford Internet Institutes can be used for data governance, ensuring that\ndata used in AI models is managed responsibly. Similarly, Fairlearn can be used to assess the fairness\nof AI systems, helping to identify and mitigate biases that may affect sustainability reporting. The\nGHG Protocol Toolkit can be used to measure the carbon emissions associated with AI models, pro-\nviding the data needed for risk assessments and sustainability disclosures. Establishing a centralised\ndashboard to track AI-related carbon emissions, risk levels, and mitigation progress across departments\ncan enhance collaboration and ensure a unified approach to managing the environmental risks of AI.\nUnder the governance principles outlined in SS1/23, these tools support the development of a com-\nprehensive risk management strategy that includes environmental sustainability as a core component\n[AC24, McC24, SS24, RAK24]."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Incorporating the carbon footprint of AI into the risk management frameworks of the banking sector\nis a critical step toward aligning AI deployment with sustainability objectives and regulatory require-\nments.

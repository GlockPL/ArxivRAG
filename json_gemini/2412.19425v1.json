{"title": "A Self-Efficacy Theory-based Study on the Teachers' Readiness to Teach Artificial Intelligence in Public Schools in Sri Lanka", "authors": ["Chathura Rajapakse", "Wathsala Ariyarathna", "Shanmugalingam Selvakan"], "abstract": "This paper explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate Al into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach Al was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level, and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this paper. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers' readiness to teach Al hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching Al in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers' self-efficacy for Al instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach. This study identified several key findings: 1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI, 2) Teachers' self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI, 3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching Al, and 4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal 2persuasion had a significant impact on teachers' self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers' own level of expertise in Al, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard Al curriculum. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach Al in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government's teacher training initiatives.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The need for and challenges of teaching artificial intelligence (AI) at primary, secondary, and upper-secondary levels have been a major focus of recent academic discussions [1], [2], [3]. Often referred to as AI4K12 [4], this area explores global initiatives that introduce Al to students from kindergarten through high school. The rapid advancements in deep learning and generative Al technologies suggest Al will become a transformative force. This realisation has prompted governments and policymakers to recognise the need to prepare future citizens for a world heavily influenced by AI. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into information systems, concerns are mounting about citizens' ability to use these systems responsibly and understand the consequences of not doing so [5]. Furthermore, anxieties regarding Al's potential impact on societal sustainability highlight the need to equip future workforces with the skills to combine human creativity with Al's potential to create sustainable systems. In light of these issues, many countries worldwide recognise the critical importance of educating future generations about artificial intelligence from a young age [6]. However, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into K-12 education presents a complex challenge [Z]. Effectively implementing AI4K12 initiatives requires addressing a multifaceted landscape that encompasses educational standards, curriculum design, formal and informal learning opportunities, student learning outcomes, teacher professional development, and the continuity of the learning process (i.e., learning progression) [8]. As AI education in K-12 settings is an emerging field, numerous research gaps need to be filled to optimise AI4K12 programs. Key unanswered questions include: 1) Policy and Guidelines: What types of policies and guidelines should be established [4],[2],[10], [11]? 2) Content Design: What kind of content is most suitable for different age groups [12], [13]? 3) Delivery Methods: What is the most effective approach for delivering Al education [14],[15],[16]? 4) Learning Environment: How can we leverage both formal and informal education to enhance students' Al competency [17], [18], [19]? 5) Assessment Strategies: How should we assess student learning outcomes related to AI [8], [20], [21]? 6) Teacher Preparedness: Are teachers adequately equipped to deliver AI-related content [22], [23], [24]? 7) Teacher Confidence: How can we bolster teacher confidence in teaching AI topics [8],[25]? 8) Learning Continuity: How can we ensure a continuous and progressive Al learning experience for students [8], [18], [19]? The global education landscape is characterised by significant diversity in social norms, culture, language, economy, and digital access. A successful AI4K12 initiative in one country may not translate effectively to another. Therefore, further research from diverse regions is crucial to inform policymakers' decisions regarding AI4K12 implementation."}, {"title": "2 Problem", "content": "Empowering teachers is a crucial aspect of integrating Al into school ICT education [31], [32]. Effectively delivering a curriculum centred on core Al concepts like perception, knowledge representation and reasoning, learning, natural interactions, and societal impact [33] requires teachers to possess a broader understanding of AI technologies, pedagogical knowledge, and strong mental preparedness [34]. A significant challenge lies in the fact that most teachers are not digital natives, unlike their students. This can make teaching an advanced subject like Al particularly demanding [35]. Research indicates that many teachers express concerns about teaching Al and report a lack of confidence due to limited access to relevant knowledge in technology, pedagogy, and content [8]. The authors' own interactions with Sri Lankan ICT teachers over several years confirm this observation. Despite the need for teacher preparation, there's a scarcity of studies assessing teacher readiness for AI4K12 initiatives in various countries. Since Sri Lanka has chosen to incorporate Al into its school ICT curriculum, evaluating the current teacher workforce's preparedness to teach this subject is essential. Such an evaluation would inform policymakers about the necessary teacher professional development approaches to enhance their confidence and equip them to support the AI4K12 initiative effectively. Thus, the two critical questions addressed in this study are:\n\u2022\nHow ready is the Sri Lankan ICT teacher workforce to teach Al at the K12 level?\n\u2022\nWhat teacher professional development approach would make them better prepared and confident to teach the subject?"}, {"title": "2.1 Review of Relevant Scholarship", "content": "Research on integrating Al into K-12 education has grown significantly in recent years. This is particularly evident in the surge of published literature between 2020 and 2023. This trend highlights the field's novelty and the growing global interest in this field of study. However, the majority of current research focuses on curriculum development and teaching methods (pedagogy). Additionally, the expanding body of literature on STEAM education increasingly explores the effective use of Al to introduce STEM subjects at the K-12 level [36],[37]. Broadly, the connection between Al and education can be categorised into three areas: (1) learning with AI, (2) learning about Al, and (3) preparing students for a future influenced by AI [38]. This study specifically excludes the first category (learning with AI) and focuses on the latter two. In simpler terms, our research targets the readiness of teachers who will directly teach AI, not other STEM instructors who might leverage Al to enhance their own subject delivery."}, {"title": "2.2 Hypothesis, Aims, and Objectives", "content": "This study investigates the readiness of Sri Lankan public school teachers to teach AI. The goal is to inform administrators in designing effective professional development programs that can enhance teacher confidence in delivering Al education. The study utilises self-efficacy theory [44] as its theoretical framework, differing from the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) used in some related research. This choice is justified because the obligation to teach Al in Sri Lankan public schools stems from a government policy, making it a mandatory requirement rather than a planned behaviour for teachers. In other words, teachers are expected to cover the Al content in the government-approved curriculum regardless of their personal preferences. Self-efficacy theory is a more suitable lens through which to examine teacher readiness. Readiness, defined as a teacher's confidence in delivering Al education to students from elementary to high school [41], aligns well with the concept of self-efficacy. Teacher self-efficacy, which refers to a teacher's belief in their ability to impact student learning outcomes [45], reflects a teacher's willful self-confidence (and thereby the readiness) to teach this complex subject in the classroom. Several studies have explored the connection between teacher readiness and self-efficacy. \u015eatgeldi's master's thesis on developing an instrument for science teachers' perceived readiness for STEM education highlights self-efficacy as a key determinant of readiness [46]. Citing Baker [47], \u015eatgeldi suggests that teachers with low self-efficacy may shy away from teaching concepts they find difficult. Another study by Baker examines the relationship between teachers' self-efficacy regarding general classroom management skills and their readiness (defined as both ability and willingness) to adapt specific behaviour management techniques to individual student needs [48]. Baker further investigates the link between teachers' beliefs about their interpersonal self-efficacy for classroom management and their readiness to implement targeted behaviour management strategies [47]. Integrating Al into the curriculum can also be viewed as a desired organisational change. Cunningham suggests that employees with higher self-efficacy towards change and who actively contribute to change initiatives can facilitate smoother implementation [49]. Similarly, Bagus Emsza et al.'s study on the relationship between self-efficacy and change readiness found that employees with high self-efficacy are more receptive to briefings and empowerment, leading to more effective change implementation [50]. Their findings support the argument that teacher self-efficacy significantly impacts their readiness to adopt the desired change of teaching Al as part of the school ICT curriculum. Bandura defined self-efficacy as \"beliefs in one's capabilities to organise and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments\" [51]. He identified four key factors that influence self-efficacy: mastery"}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "This study targeted in-service public-school teachers in Sri Lanka who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Sri Lanka has a mature ICT teacher workforce of 6,500 with extensive experience delivering a continuously updated ICT curriculum since 2007. As a national policy, ICT is a mandatory subject from grade 6 onwards, aligning with international secondary and upper-secondary levels. Following a curriculum revision in 2021-2022, the Sri Lankan government plans to integrate Artificial Intelligence into the school ICT curriculum starting in 2024. Therefore, current in-service ICT teachers represent the most relevant population for this study. Furthermore, the Sri Lankan ICT curriculum is typically delivered in the two national languages, Sinhala and Tamil, as well as English. This necessitates including teachers from both Sinhalese and Tamil ethnicities in the respondent pool."}, {"title": "3.1 Sampling, Distribution, and Ethnic Diversity", "content": "This study employed a snowball sampling method, leveraging authors' connections with various government education institutions (Ministry of Education, National Institute of Education) involved in education policy, teacher professional development and curriculum development. This facilitated reaching a diverse initial sample of respondents across ethnicities and geographical locations. These initial respondents were then asked to share the questionnaire with others in their professional networks. The questionnaire was prepared electronically for easy distribution via email and social media, maximising potential reach. The goal of snowball sampling was to gather a large number of responses with good geographical representation. To accommodate respondent preferences, the questionnaire was available in both Sinhala and Tamil. Careful attention was given when selecting the initial respondents to mitigate potential bias in the snowball sampling method. The questionnaire was administered in June and July 2023, yielding 1236 responses. This represents roughly 20% of the target population. Notably, responses were received from all populated areas of the country, with a sufficient concentration in all populated areas of the country. Furthermore, the data reflects the ethnic diversity of the country with substantial representation from Tamil-speaking regions like Nothern, Central, and Eastern provinces. The Muslim-majority areas in the Eastern province are also well-represented."}, {"title": "3.2 Constructs, Measures and Scale Development.", "content": "The conceptual model in identifies five factors influencing teacher self-efficacy: mastery experience, physiological and emotional states, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and imaginary experience. These factors are considered exogenous latent constructs (independent variables), while self-efficacy is the endogenous latent construct (dependent variable). To measure these constructs, a scale was developed based on existing teacher self-efficacy measurement scales and relevant literature [55]. While numerous researchers have attempted to create methods for measuring teacher efficacy [55], challenges arise due to conceptual ambiguity surrounding the construct [56]. Several prominent self-efficacy questionnaires exist, including the generalised self-efficacy scale [57], teacher self-efficacy scale [58], and science teachers' self-efficacy scale [59]. However, due to its clarity and recent development, the Sources of Teacher Efficacy Questionnaire (STEQ) (by Hoi et al. [52] was chosen as the baseline scale for this study. Hoi et al. developed the STEQ with two goals: to create a scale for assessing teacher self-efficacy and to examine the relationship between self-efficacy and its four main sources, as identified by Bandura: Mastery Experience, Vicarious Experience, Physiological and Emotional State, and Verbal Persuasion. The STEQ's 26 items were primarily adapted, with some revisions, from the Sources of Middle School Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale by Usher and Pajares [60]. To ensure clarity, accuracy, and compliance, six experienced teachers reviewed these items. Additionally, a second scale, the Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES) [55], was adopted to measure the respondents' level of self-efficacy (the dependent variable) separately. The TSES, previously established as a three-factor model (instructional strategies, classroom management, and student engagement), has demonstrated reliability and validity across various populations [55]. Prior to evaluating the STEQ's reliability and validity, the newly collected data was used to re-assess the internal consistency and factorial structure of the TSES. The internal consistency of the three subscales (0.88 to 0.90) was satisfactory. Fit indices like the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) also indicated a good fit for the factorial structure. However, the researchers ultimately chose a second-order model for the factorial structure due to its superior fit compared to the three-factor model. The composite self-efficacy score derived from this second-order TSES model served as the study's independent variable According to Hoi et al., the STEQ demonstrates strong internal consistency, reliability, and validity. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the STEQ's factorial structure. The four-factor model exhibited superior fit compared to alternative one-factor and second-order models ($\\chi^2$ (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 [.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Additionally, all standardised residual covariances were below an absolute value of 0.3, further supporting the four-factor model as a good fit for the data. Internal consistency reliability (alpha) was satisfactory for all four subscales: mastery experience (0.89), vicarious experience (0.86), social persuasion (0.90), and physiological arousal (0.87). The study also provides evidence for criterion-related validity. The four STEQ constructs exhibited moderate to high positive correlations (ranging from 0.63 to 0.79) with the composite self-efficacy factor derived from the TSES. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis revealed that all four STEQ factors were significant predictors of self-efficacy (F = 146.94, p < 0.001). Therefore,"}, {"title": "3.3 Data Collection", "content": "Data collection for this study utilised a structured questionnaire. In addition to statements assessing self-efficacy, the questionnaire gathered basic demographic information from respondents, including gender, educational background, school location, age group, and teaching experience. It also included a questionnaire item for respondents to self-rank their knowledge level on key topics in artificial intelligence literature. Throughout the process, anonymity was maintained \u2013 no data was collected that could identify individual participants. Of the initial 1236 responses, 116 were excluded due to missing data. This resulted in a final sample size of 1120 responses used for analysis. A summary of the sample demographics is provided below."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Self-efficacy was initially measured using the method developed by Schwarzer and Jerusalem in their generalised self-efficacy scale [57]. Each question related to self-efficacy offered four answer choices (a, b, c, and d) and assigned scores of 10, 20, 30, and 40 points, respectively. For example, if a respondent selected option (b) for a question, their answer would be scored as 20. An individual's overall self-efficacy score was then calculated by summing the scores from all self-efficacy questions. The average self-efficacy score across all respondents was 647. However, when normalised using a min-max scaling approach, this value translates to 46%, suggesting a somewhat lower overall level of self-efficacy among the teachers. Interestingly, the indicator variables (EF01, EF02, EF03) representing the exogenous variable \"Self-Efficacy\" generally received higher scores. This inconsistency warrants further investigation of the overall self-efficacy score before drawing conclusions about the teachers' readiness to teach artificial intelligence."}, {"title": "4.1 Measuring Overall Self-Efficacy", "content": "The responses for other self-efficacy indicators, including Vicarious Experiences, Verbal Persuasion, Emotional and Physiological Factors, Imaginary Experiences, and External Factors, were also analysed (Figure 4.3). Notably, over half of the respondents chose answers (a) or (b) for Vicarious Experiences and Verbal Persuasion. This suggests: A potential lack of motivation within peer groups - They may not be witnessing high-quality teaching from colleagues. A serious lack of mentor-mentee relationships - Over 80% reported lacking a proper mentor to guide their teaching development. Little to no experience of receiving appreciation for successful teaching. However, the responses for Emotional and Physiological Factors, Imaginary Experiences, and External Factors differ significantly from Vicarious Experiences and Verbal Persuasion. Over half of the respondents chose answers (c) or (d) for these indicators. This suggests that the Emotional and Physiological Factors, and Imaginary Experiences might be influenced by the high cultural value placed on the teaching profession in Sri Lanka. Respondents might be responding based on their perception of the ideal teacher role rather than their actual experiences. The extremely low percentage of respondents choosing answer (a) for these questions strengthens this argument."}, {"title": "4.2 Analysis of the Conceptual Model", "content": "This section analyses the conceptual model of self-efficacy presented in Section 2.2 using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) [62]. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing teacher self-efficacy in teaching AI. The inner model includes six latent independent variables (exogenous constructs): Mastery Experiences, Vicarious Experiences, Verbal Persuasion, Emotional and Physiological Factors, Imaginary Experiences, and External Factors. These constructs are believed to influence a single latent dependent variable (endogenous construct): Self-Efficacy. The outer model indicators were primarily developed from the questions in the efficacy scale explained in Section 2.2. In simpler terms, each question on the scale corresponds to a single indicator variable for a specific latent variable in the inner model. A critical question was whether these indicator variables were formative or reflective. The key distinction lies in interchangeability. Formative indicators contribute to building the latent variable and should not be interchangeable [63]. Conversely, reflective indicators represent different aspects of the latent variable and can potentially be substituted. Based on the nature of the indicators and their interchangeability, all latent constructs in the model were determined to be reflective. The PLS-SEM model was implemented using SmartPLS 4.0 software. The analysis resulted in removing some indicator variables from the \"Mastery Experience\" construct. Decisions about removing indicator variables were based on two criteria: the average variance extracted (AVE) value and the outer loading values of all indicators for that construct [64]. Following this approach, indicator variables MS01, MS08, MS09, MS10, MS12, and MS13 were excluded from the \"Mastery Experience\" construct. While a minimum outer loading of 0.7 is generally recommended for retaining indicators in reflective models [64], some exceptions were made for \"Mastery Experience\" and \"External Factors.\" In these cases, certain indicators with outer loadings below 0.7 were retained based on their impact on the overall AVE of the construct, as suggested in [64]. Furthermore, the p-values associated with the relationships between each indicator variable and its corresponding latent construct all indicate strong positive relationships."}, {"title": "4.3 Evaluation of the Measurement Model", "content": "The measurement model was evaluated using three key criteria: internal consistency reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity [64], [65]. Internal consistency reliability, assessed by Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability (rho_c) [64], measures how well the indicators within a latent variable capture the same underlying concept [66]. As shown in all latent variables have rho_c values exceeding 0.7, indicating good internal consistency. Minor discrepancies were observed for three latent variables with Cronbach's Alpha values slightly below 0.7. However, considering their high rho_c values, these deviations were deemed acceptable [67]. Convergent validity, evaluated using Average Variance Extracted (AVE) [64], examines whether theoretically related constructs are indeed related in the model [68]. AVE represents the average amount of variance in the indicators reflecting the latent variable. According to [64], an AVE value above 0.5 indicates adequate convergent validity. demonstrates that all reflective latent variables have AVE values exceeding 0.5, suggesting good convergent validity for the measurement model. In conclusion, the evaluation using internal consistency reliability and convergent validity demonstrates that the reflective measurement model possesses strong measurement properties."}, {"title": "4.4 Evaluation of the Structural Model", "content": "The structural model's effectiveness was assessed using four key criteria: coefficient of determination (R\u00b2), predictive relevance (Q\u00b2), effect sizes (f\u00b2), and the significance and strength of path coefficients [67]. R\u00b2, as shown in Table 4.3, indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (\"Self-Efficacy\") explained by the independent variables in the model. While minimum acceptable R\u00b2 values vary by research field, social science studies generally consider values above 0.5 to be acceptable [70]. In this case, the R\u00b2 value of 0.683 suggests a strong correlation between the independent variables and self-efficacy. Predictive relevance, measured by Q\u00b2, goes beyond simply explaining variance. It assesses how well the model predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables. As seen in Table 4.3, the Q\u00b2 value for self-efficacy is well above zero, indicating the model has very high predictive power. This evaluation using R\u00b2 and Q\u00b2 suggests that the structural model effectively captures the relationships between the independent variables and self-efficacy in teaching Al."}, {"title": "4.5 Examining the Teachers' Level of Expertise in Al", "content": "Given the weak but significant relationship between mastery experience and self-efficacy identified earlier, a further analysis was conducted to explore teachers' Al expertise in more detail. The questionnaire included a section where participants ranked their knowledge of popular Al topics using a five-point scale: 0 (no knowledge), 1 (have heard of), 2 (average), 4 (good), and 5 (very good). As the figure shows, the teachers' overall Al expertise appears to be quite low. Most respondents indicated either \"no knowledge\" or \"have heard of\" for all the listed Al topics. However, a few participants demonstrated somewhat satisfactory mastery in areas like Intelligent Agents, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks, and Ethics and Social Impact of AI. Unfortunately, this group represents a minority compared to the majority of teachers who have little to no experience with AI."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "The findings in Section 4.5 directly address the key research question of this paper: how prepared is the existing K-12 teacher workforce to deliver an Al curriculum? It is clearly evident from the results that the current level of Al expertise among teachers is largely insufficient. The AI4K12 policy framework outlines five core concepts for an Al curriculum: Perception, Representation & Reasoning, Learning, Natural Interaction, and Societal Impact. Based on this study's findings, it is evident that only a small percentage of teachers possess the competency to adequately cover content aligned with these AI4K12 guidelines. This conclusion is further reinforced by the average overall self-efficacy score presented in Section 4.1. These results reveal a significant lack of readiness among current teachers to effectively teach artificial intelligence. The next crucial question, then, is how to prepare teachers for the proposed curriculum if they are not currently ready. The PLS model presented in this paper offers valuable insights to address this challenge."}, {"title": "5.1 Insights from the Structural Model", "content": "The study's findings offer valuable insights for designing professional development programs to enhance teachers' Al teaching competency. As revealed by the structural model evaluation in Section 4.4, vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion have no significant influence on teachers' self-efficacy. This lack of contribution suggests two key areas for improvement within teacher development programs. Firstly, the insignificant effect of vicarious experiences highlights a potential lack of role model teachers and mentors in the current system. Exposing teachers to successful Al educators through workshops, online resources, or peer observation programs could be beneficial. Secondly, the minimal impact of verbal persuasion suggests that teachers may not receive sufficient recognition or encouragement for developing AI teaching skills. Teacher professional development programmes could emphasise positive reinforcement through various strategies such as praising the efforts of teacher learners, constructive feedback mechanisms during learning, encouraging them to take risks and innovate when learning to teach, and rewarding them for teaching excellence. The structural model revealed another interesting finding: emotional and physiological factors, along with imaginary experiences, had a greater contribution to teachers' self-efficacy for teaching Al than mastery experiences. Given the limited integration of Al into the current ICT curriculum, this could suggest that teachers are drawing on their past experience teaching other ICT topics, which were also challenging. The higher contribution of imaginary experiences might be culturally specific to Sri Lanka, where teaching is a respected profession. This could explain why teachers are optimistic about their success in teaching Al despite the apparent lack of mastery. Interestingly, while mastery experience has a weak but significant positive impact on self-efficacy, a closer look reveals this likely stems from specific survey items (MS04 and MS07). These items appear to tap into the respondents' general belief that they can handle teaching Al similarly to their past experiences with emerging technologies. Overall, these findings suggest a complex interplay of factors influencing teacher self-efficacy for Al education. While confidence in existing teaching skills is positive, it highlights the potential need for targeted professional development programs that address the specific challenges and opportunities of integrating Al into the curriculum."}, {"title": "5.2 Implications of the findings", "content": "The second research question focused on strategies to prepare teachers for the proposed Al curriculum. The study's findings offer valuable insights for policymakers addressing this challenge. Currently, the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Education primarily rely on a direct, face-to-face teacher training approach. However, resource limitations hinder island-wide coverage, prompting a recent shift towards the \"train-the-trainer\" model. Additionally, efforts have been made to incorporate learner-centered approaches. However, the study raises questions about whether these existing methods can effectively enhance teachers' self-efficacy for teaching advanced subjects like Al, particularly in engaging young learners. The low contribution of vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion to self-efficacy suggests a need for a more systemic approach. This research recommends a connected teacher professional development system, fostering stronger and more frequent connections among teachers and stakeholders with valuable resources. As connectivism learning theory suggests [74], continuous and evolving networks on technology-assisted platforms enable the exchange of knowledge, ideas, and resources. Building on this concept, the research proposes a socio-technical system for teacher development, supported by external stakeholders, as an alternative to the existing approach. This approach aligns with the ecological perspective of learning [75] and could potentially alleviate resource constraints."}, {"title": "5.3 Limitations and Future Work", "content": "This study has some limitations that offer opportunities for future research. While the self-efficacy scale primarily drew upon existing literature, some items lacked formal reliability and validity testing. Future research can address this by developing a rigorously validated and reliable scale specifically designed to assess AI teachers' self-efficacy. The analysis did not consider factors such as age, gender, geographical location, or educational background. For example, younger teachers might exhibit higher self-efficacy and be more connected with others in the educational system than older teachers. Additionally, teachers with a background in mathematics (from GCE Advanced Level exams and bachelor's degrees) might be better equipped to grasp Al concepts than those with social science or commerce backgrounds. These factors could potentially act as mediating variables in the proposed conceptual model. One future direction is to extend this research by analysing the impact of these mediating factors on teachers' self-efficacy for teaching Al. Another area for future exploration involves the capital-based view of teacher competence for Al education presented in the discussion. A deeper analysis of the collected data from a capital perspective (human, social, cultural, psychological, and agentic) could provide valuable insights for designing a socio-technical teacher training system. In essence, understanding the teachers' overall capital would further inform the development of effective interventions."}, {"title": "6 conclusion", "content": "This paper investigated Sri Lankan secondary and upper-secondary ICT teachers' self-efficacy for teaching artificial intelligence (AI). The goal was to assess their preparedness for the government's planned integration of Al into the 2024 academic year curriculum. The study provides compelling evidence that teachers' current self-efficacy and, consequently, their readiness to teach Al is very low. The data analysis revealed a critical lack of vicarious experiences (learning from others), verbal persuasion (encouragement), and mastery experiences (experiences of successful encounters of mastery). Drawing on a capital-based view of employability, the study concludes that teachers are not currently prepared to teach AI. This research is one of the first (if not the very first) in Sri Lanka to assess ICT teachers' readiness for an advanced technology like AI. The findings hold significant value for policymakers who are developing professional development programs to equip teachers for success in AI4K12 initiatives. Moreover, these results could inform AI4K12 policymakers and researchers worldwide, serving as a benchmark for strategising teacher development programs in their respective countries. The study recommends a systems thinking approach to teacher training to address self-efficacy issues. This approach opens doors for future research based on complex socio-technical systems."}]}

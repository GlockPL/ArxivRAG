Clustering algorithms assist in analyzing fuel efficiency by grouping data into clusters, but irrelevant features may complicate the analysis and choosing the optimal number of clusters remains a challenging task. Therefore, this paper employs the Gaussian mixture models to cluster the solo fuel-efficiency dataset. Moreover, an integration method that combines the Silhouette index, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index is developed to select the optimal cluster numbers. A dataset with 4006 bus trips in North Jutland, Denmark is utilized as the case study. Trips are first split into three groups, then one group is divided further, resulting in four categories: extreme, normal, low, and extremely low fuel efficiency. A preliminary study using visualization analysis is conducted to investigate how driving behaviors and route conditions affect fuel efficiency. The results indicate that both individual driving habits and route characteristics have a significant influence on fuel efficiency.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) have given rise to global warming through the greenhouse effect in recent years, resulting in numerous ecological and social problems. The transportation sector contributes to almost 25% of GHG emissions in the European Union (EU) [1], about 76% of which are caused by road transport [2]. To achieve the United Nations' sustainability goals, eco-driving strategies need to be investigated aimed at reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.\nPublic transportation, particularly bus networks, plays a significant role in urban mobility, providing a sustainable alternative to individual vehicle usage. Therefore, bus networks represent a significant contributor to energy usage and GHG emissions. Enhancing the fuel efficiency of the systems holds promise for reducing negative environmental impact and enhancing sustainability in urban environments [3-4]."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "The paper presents a three-step analysis of fuel efficiency in public transport. First, it begins with the collection of fuel-efficiency data. Second, it employs multiple clustering evaluation indexes to determine the optimal number of clusters in Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, and then refines these clusters through statistical analysis. Finally, it conducts a detailed statistical analysis of each cluster's distribution and examines the factors affecting fuel efficiency."}, {"title": "2.1 GMM Clustering Algorithm", "content": "The GMM clustering algorithm is chosen for its flexibility in accommodating mixed membership and varying cluster shapes, unlike the spherical clusters of K-means [13]. It uses a probabilistic model assuming data points are from multiple Gaussian distributions, aiming to uncover these distributions and assign points to them. The probability density function of the multivariate GMM is:\n$$p(x) = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{K}\\pi_{i}N(x|\\mu_{i}, \\Sigma_{i})$$\nwhere K refers to the number of mixture components, $\\pi_{i}$ represents the weight of the i-th Gaussian component, and $N(x|\\mu_{i}, \\Sigma_{i})$ denotes the i-th Gaussian distribution with the mean $\\mu_{i}$ and the covariance $\\Sigma_{i}$.\nParameters of the Gaussian process, like mean and covariance, are estimated using the EM algorithm, which iteratively adjusts parameters through an E-step, calculating the expected log-likelihood, and an M-step, maximizing this expectation. For a GMM with K components and N observations, the E-step softly assigns each sample to a component.\n$$\\gamma_{j}(x_{n}) \\leftarrow \\frac{\\pi_{j}N(x_{n}|\\mu_{j},\\Sigma_{j})}{\\Sigma_{k=1}^{K}\\pi_{k}N(x_{n}|\\mu_{k},\\Sigma_{k})}  \\forall j = 1, ... K; n = 1, ..., N$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{j}(x_{n})$ refers to the probability that the n-th data point is generated by the j-th Gaussian component and $\\pi_{j}$ denotes the weight of the j-th component, where 0 \u2264 $\\pi_{j}$ \u2264 1 for each j\u2208 {1, ... K} and $\\Sigma_{j=1}^{K} \\pi_{j} = 1$.\nIn the M-step, the parameters $\\pi_{j}$, $\\mu_{j}$ and $S_{j}$ are re-estimated and updated separately for each mixture component based on the soft assignments in the E-step following the order of equations (3) to (6).\n$$\\hat{N_{j}^{new}} \\leftarrow \\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}\\gamma_{j}(x_{n})$$\n$$\\pi_{j}^{new} \\leftarrow \\frac{\\hat{N_{j}^{new}}}{N}$$\n$$\\mu_{j}^{new} \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{\\hat{N_{j}^{new}}} \\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}\\gamma_{j}(x_{n}) x_{n}$$\n$$\\Sigma_{j}^{new} \\leftarrow \\frac{1}{\\hat{N_{j}^{new}}} \\Sigma_{n=1}^{N} \\gamma_{j}(x_{n}) (x_{n} - \\mu_{j}^{new})(x_{n} - \\mu_{j}^{new})^{T}$$"}, {"title": "2.2 Selection of Cluster Numbers", "content": "The initial determination of the number of clusters is crucial when applying the GMM clustering algorithm. Both cohesion and separation metrics need to be considered to select the optimal number of clusters [14]. Cohesion denotes the degree of proximity among data points within a cluster, while separation signifies the distinctiveness between clusters. In this case, three clustering evaluation indexes, including the Silhouette index (SI) [10], the Calinski-Harabasz index (CHI) [11], and the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) [12], are employed to assess the performance of the clustering with varying\nnumbers of clusters. Subsequently, the ranking of each index is calculated and the average of these rankings is utilized as the coefficient to select the optimal number of clusters.\nThe Silhouette index (SI). The SI considers the pairwise distance within the between clusters. It ranges between -1 and 1, and an SI close to 1 indicates a good partition of data points.\nFor the i-th sample in the I-th cluster $C_{I}$, I = 1, ..., K, the silhouette width is:\n$$S_{i} = \\frac{b_{i}-a_{i}}{max (a_{i},b_{i})}$$\nwhere $a_{i}$ refers to the mean distance between the i-th instance and all other samples in $C_{I}$, and $b_{i}$ denotes the smallest mean distance between the i-th instance in $C_{I}$ and all samples outside $C_{I}$.\nAssuming the number of data points in the cluster $C_{I}$ is M, the SI for $C_{I}$ is:\n$$SI_{1} = \\frac{1}{M}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{M} S_{i}$$\nThe SI for the entire dataset with K clusters is:\n$$SI = max SI_{1}$$\nThe Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI). The CHI calculates the sum of squares of values between and within the clusters. A higher value of the CHI represents a better performance of clustering. Assuming a dataset with N observations is clustered into K clusters, the CHI is:\n$$CHI = \\frac{BC}{WC} \\frac{N-K}{K-1}$$\nwhere $BC$ represents the weighted sum of squared Euclidean distances between each cluster centroid and the overall centroid of the dataset, and $WC$ refers to the sum of squared Euclidean distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.\nThe Davies-Bouldin index (DBI). The DBI computes the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, where the similarity signifies the ratio of the within-cluster scatter to the between-cluster distance. A lower DBI value indicates a better performance of clustering. Assuming a dataset with N observations is clustered into K clusters, the DBI is:\n$$DBI = \\frac{1}{K}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{K} max_{j\\neq i} (\\frac{d_{i}+d_{j}}{d(c_{i}+c_{j})})$$\nWhere $c_{i}$ and $c_{j}$ are the centroids of clusters i and j, $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ denote the average Euclidean distances from $c_{i}$ to the data points in the cluster i and $c_{j}$ to the data points\nin the cluster j respectively, and d($c_{i}$ + $c_{j}$) refers to the Euclidean distance between $c_{i}$\nand $c_{j}$."}, {"title": "3 Case Study", "content": "The proposed framework based on GMM clustering is employed to analyze the bus trips from the public transport system of North Jutland, Denmark. A bus trip in this study is defined as a traveled way from the first stop to the destination of a bus plan in a specific time.

The proportion of drivers' IDs and routes' IDs in each cluster is thoroughly analyzed in the following sub-sections through a detailed discussion of the bar charts shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6.\nDrivers. This section examines the fuel-efficiency performance of 202 drivers in the recorded 4006 trips based on the 'DriverId' feature. The analysis categorizes the trips made by these drivers into four clusters in Section 4.1 to observe patterns in fuel efficiency. The proportion of each driver's trips across the four clusters is compared to the average proportion of all trips, to identify individual drivers' performance in terms of fuel efficiency.\nFig. 5 indicates that the proportion of each driver's fuel-efficiency performance varies from the average trips' proportion across clusters. As Cluster 0 (the orange segment) contains insufficient samples for robust analysis, Clusters 1 to 3 (the green, purple, and brown segments respectively) can provide a detailed look into the drivers' fuel efficiency distributions. Significant differences between the segments' length of each bar and the position of the dashed lines of each cluster suggest notable differences in fuel efficiency among drivers.\nThe analysis highlights that individual driving behaviors significantly impact fuel efficiency, leading to considerable variances from the expected average distributions. In particular, the dominant segment proportion of Cluster 1 or 2 in individual drivers' bars underlines the influence of individual driving practices on fuel efficiency. In most individual trips, one cluster's trips comprise nearly 100%, while the remaining three clusters are almost 0%.\nRoutes. This section analyzes the fuel-efficiency performance of 44 routes in the recorded trips, based on the 'RouteID' feature from our dataset. The analysis categorizes the trips of different routes into four clusters in Section 4.1 to observe patterns in fuel efficiency. The trips of each route are assessed to determine their proportion across the\nfour clusters. These percentages are then compared to the average proportion of all trips, to identify characteristics of routes in terms of fuel efficiency.\nFig. 6 indicates that the proportion of the fuel-efficiency performance in each route varies from the average trips' proportion across clusters. Similar to Fig. 5, Clusters 1 to 3 (the green, purple, and brown segments respectively) can offer a detailed examination\nof the routes' fuel efficiency distributions. The substantial differences between the lengths of the segments in each bar and the positions of the dashed lines for each cluster\nindicate notable variations in fuel efficiency across different routes.\nThe analysis highlights that individual route characteristics significantly impact fuel efficiency, leading to considerable variances from the expected average distributions. In particular, the dominant segment proportion of Cluster 1 or 2 in individual route bars\nunderlines the influence of individual route characteristics on fuel efficiency.

Fig. 7 demonstrates the distribution of each cluster along with their outliers depicted through boxplots. The black hollow circles denote the outliers.\nAs seen in Fig. 7, samples in Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 are concentrated in a specific range without any outliers. However, Cluster 0 contains two outliers and Cluster 3 exhibits several outliers. This observation indicates that extreme fuel consumption is atypical in bus operations. Therefore, further investigation to understand their influencing factors should be conducted independently of the normal trips (Cluster 1&2). Furthermore, the recommendation of avoiding extremely low fuel efficiency could be explored\nas another topic for future research.\nFuel-efficiency Influencing Factors. By examining the discrepancies in Fig. 5 and\nFig. 6, it can be inferred that the fuel efficiency of distinct drivers and routes varies\nsignificantly. This variance underscores the substantial impact of individual driving\nhabits and route characteristics. Consequently, personalized driver training and interventions are crucial to enhancing fuel efficiency across various routes. To provide more\ndetailed recommendations on fuel efficiency enhancement, a thorough analysis of the\nrelationship among features regarding driving behavior, route conditions, and fuel efficiency is necessary. For instance, trips characterized by low or extremely low fuel efficiency might benefit from modifications in driving practices or route adjustments. This\nanalysis should involve correlation analysis and causal inference to elucidate the influencing factors of fuel efficiency."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "To investigate the bus fuel consumption in public transportation systems, this paper employs the GMM clustering algorithm to categorize the fuel efficiency data and an integration method for optimal cluster selection. An integration method combining the Silhouette index, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index is developed to select the optimal cluster numbers. Through the analysis of a dataset comprising 4006 bus trips in North Jutland, Denmark, four fuel efficiency categories are identified, including extreme fuel efficiency, normal fuel efficiency, low fuel efficiency, and extremely low fuel efficiency. Moreover, the significant impact of driving behaviors and route conditions on fuel efficiency is highlighted by the analysis of bar charts.\nThese findings emphasize the importance of targeted interventions to improve fuel efficiency in public transportation, thereby advancing sustainability goals and reducing environmental impact. Future studies should explore influential factors on fuel efficiency in each group, including correlation analysis and causal inference methodologies. Such comprehensive analyses could provide deeper insights into the factors affecting fuel consumption and support the development of more effective policies and\npractices in public transportation."}]}

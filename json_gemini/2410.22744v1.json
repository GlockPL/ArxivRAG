We will explore critical aspects of persona design, such as\nvoice, embodiment, and demographics, and their impact on user satisfaction and engagement. Through discussions and hands-on\nactivities, we aim to propose practices and standards that enhance the ecological validity of agent personas. Topics include the design\nof conversational interfaces, the influence of agent personas on user experience, and approaches for creating contextually appropriate\nAl agents.

Virtual agents (VAs)\nare software programs designed to assist users by completing tasks, answering queries, or providing information [36].\nAl agents are a subset of virtual assistants that employ Al techniques to understand, learn from, and adapt to user\npreferences over time [33]. They can range from simple rule-based systems to complex, learning-based models, de-\npending on the tasks they are designed to perform. Examples of AI agents include Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, and\nChatGPT. The interfaces that allow users to interact with an agent using natural language through text or voice are\nreferred to as Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) [29]. The growing popularity of these interfaces is largely driven\nby advances in natural language processing capabilities [15]. While much of the research in this area has focused on\nimproving system efficiency and accuracy [1, 38], it is equally important to consider the appearance and representa-\ntion of Al agents. Mismatch in user expectations and agent's presentation could result in infrequent use and eventually\nun-use [8, 9, 35]. Yuksel et al. suggest that an agent's visual appeal may be more critical to user satisfaction than its\nreliability [37]. Similarly, Lopatovska et al. [23] emphasize that, depending on the task, a positive user experience (UX)\nmay take precedence over the accuracy of outcomes. Additionally, Desai et al. [7] found that the choice of persona\nalso affects the perceived trust, likeability, and intention to adopt. This highlights that users' engagement, satisfaction,\nand even trust are influenced not only by the technical performance of AI systems but also by the broader interaction\nprocess, including the agent's persona and presentation.\nThere is a common misconception that the representation of Al agents is a superficial aspect, seemingly detached\nfrom the core components that significantly contribute to the system's effectiveness and user acceptance [22, 37]. How-\never, this view is shifting. With the proliferation of AI agents, particularly in homes and smartphones, research into the\npersona and representation dimension of such agents has been expanding. Studies suggest that many conversational\nagents fail to meet user expectations as effective interlocutors [11, 12, 21, 24, 31, 40]. A potential contributing factor\nto this shortfall is the insufficient emphasis placed on the representation of these entities as engaging conversation\npartners. Agents like Amazon Alexa and Google Home serve complex roles, from financial advisors to health coaches,\nfacilitating tasks that significantly impact users' daily lives [6, 7, 14]. Despite rapid advancements in speech technology\nand its widespread commercial deployment, research into the design of these agent and their implications for users re-\nmains limited [34]. This scarcity of studies contributes to inconsistencies in the development and evaluation of system\npersonas [5, 30]. These personas are often assessed through interactive user studies, conducted both online and in lab-\noratory settings, yet lack uniform standards and methodologies. Moreover, with the growing popularity of ChatGPT,\nusers can choose personas to interact with, including those modeled after celebrities like Tom Brady and Snoop Dogg\n[26]. Additionally, they can craft personalized personas using prompt engineering techniques. These design choices\nraise ethical concerns, particularly due to their potential to reinforce and perpetuate stereotypes [20].\nTo address these challenges, this workshop will convene interdisciplinary experts to refine how Al agent personas\nare crafted. The goal is to enhance design practices and increase the ecological validity of these systems. Throughout\nthe workshop, through interactive demonstrations, vibrant group discussions, and hands-on prototyping activities, we\nwill explore key questions tailored to the creation of effective and engaging personas, such as:\n\u2022 How can we design appropriate Al agent personas based on the context of use?\n\u2022 What ethical and sociotechnical challenges arise from the design choices of Al agent personas??\nWe encourage collaboration between academia and industry and welcome participation from anyone interested\nin conversational user interface design, development, and evaluation. By bringing the interdisciplinary community\ntogether, we aim to provide insights on how to improve the development of Al agent personas tailored to specific\napplications and ensure higher ecological validity in their task-based evaluation."}, {"title": "Organisers", "content": "This workshop is organized by a team of experienced researchers with expertise spanning diverse fields aligned\nwith our objectives.

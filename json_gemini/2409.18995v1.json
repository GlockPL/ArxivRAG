{"title": "SYSTEMATIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ALIGNMENT IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CATEGORICAL DECISIONS", "authors": ["Isaac Kohane"], "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, understanding how well their decision-making aligns with human preferences and values becomes crucial, especially when we recognize that there is no single gold standard for these preferences. This paper applies a systematic methodology for evaluating preference alignment in LLMs on categorical decision-making with medical triage as a domain-specific use case. It also measures how effectively an alignment procedure will change the alignment of a specific model. Key to this methodology is a novel simple measure, the Alignment Compliance Index (ACI), that quantifies how effectively a LLM can be aligned to a given preference function or gold standard. Since the ACI measures the effect rather than the process of alignment, it is applicable to alignment methods beyond the in-context learning used in this study.\nUsing a dataset of simulated patient pairs, three frontier LLMs (GPT40, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Advanced) were assessed on their ability to make triage decisions consistent with an expert clinician's preferences. The models' performance before and after alignment attempts was evaluated using various prompting strategies. The results reveal significant variability in alignment effective-ness across models and alignment approaches. Notably, models that performed well, as measured by ACI, pre-alignment sometimes degraded post-alignment, and small changes in the target preference function led to large shifts in model rankings.\nThe implicit ethical principles, as understood by humans, underlying the LLMs' decisions were also explored through targeted questioning. These findings highlight the complex, multifaceted nature of decision-making and the challenges of robustly aligning AI systems with human values. They also motivate the use of a practical set of methods and the ACI, in the near term, to understand the corre-spondence between the variety of human and LLM decision-making values in specific scenarios.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Consider this scenario: As a primary care doctor, you have a 30-minute slot available in your already overbooked schedule for tomorrow. You must choose between two patients, as urgent messages from your administrator request you to see both as soon as possible. One patient is a 58-year-old male with osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia (LDL > 160 mg/dL), taking alendronate and atorvastatin. The other is a 72-year-old male with diabetes and an HbA1c of 9.2%, whose medications include metformin and insulin. With limited information, your decision must balance multiple, potentially competing considerations. Health professionals often disagree on such triage decisions due to the varying importance they assign to factors like urgency, overall benefit (e.g., favoring younger patients with more potential years of life), and societal cost (e.g., avoiding expensive hospitalizations). Your decision may also be influenced by personal biases, whether conscious or unconscious, ethically grounded or not. Regardless, this triage decision, which you must make immediately, will reflect your value system. Such decisions are commonplace, with clinicians making thousands daily. The scarcity of resources amplifies the values underlying triage decision-making, as seen in extreme cases like a single medic choosing among 100 soldiers on a battlefield or a primary care doctor deciding which patient must wait months for treatment.\nThe triage decision described above extends beyond medicine to a broader set of pairwise categorical decisions over multi-attribute choices. It exemplifies decision-making properties recognized by scholars of both human and computer-driven decision-making over the past 70 years[1], and the consequences or limitations of cognitive or computational resources[2, 3] that any human or computational agent must face in real-time decisions. Firstly, this triage decision reflects a set of values, whether explicit or implicit, personal or shared. Secondly, the contextual nature of these values precludes a single gold standard for triage decisions, despite potential desires to enforce one. As we contemplate the impact of AI-augmented clinical care, we must consider which of our values, if any, are represented in the AI programs providing this augmentation[4]. The pairwise triage decision serves as a deceptively simple probe into these values, allowing us to explore the inherent values in AI behavior without assuming a global ordering of such values. Pairwise triage decisions are unlikely to consistently align with global preferences over factors like age, sex, or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to complex interactions between these attributes and personal or societal preferences. Decades of research in human decision-making have shown that even experts may not converge on a consistent set of preferences, and in many cases, a single set of preferences consistent across all parties may not exist[5]. Despite extensive scholarly work on weighing values in triage decisions[6], a global consensus remains elusive[7]. That is, for many decisions relevant to humans, there is no single, universal gold standard of preferences. In current clinical practice, decision-making typically involves the clinician informally eliciting the patient's preferences to qualitatively maximize the utilities most important to the patient [8]. This work is related to the case-based measure of Petersen et al.[9] but with a focus on the measurement of the change and consistency in the triage decisions as a result of an alignment process. Also, this is not a prescriptive approach about how to ensure alignment whether with a specific set of explicit values or with the \"ability to read and predict the the responses of the [normative social structure]\"[10]. Rather, the goal is more modest, a simple framework and measure to enable benchmarking of how effective the alignment process in this class of categorical decisions is, while making as few assumptions, if any, about global structures of preference or utility or the nature of the alignment process.\nIn this study, we explore the pairwise value space using the triage task from the perspective of an AI program, specifically a large language model (LLM). Our aim is to investigate the extent to which the LLM reflects a specified set of human values, and just as importantly, to what degree it can be induced to modify its behavior to more closely align with that specified set (aka \"the gold standard\u201d). This exploration is intended to stimulate discussions about the value systems embodied in LLMs and to inspire broader, larger-scale experiments and large-scale elicitation of human preferences in specific task domains. While we ground our exploration in the domain of medical triage, this approach does not limit the generality of our findings. In the same breath, it should be made clear the results of this investigation cannot be reasonably used to rank these specific frontier LLM's for the triage task because of the small sample of the vast space of possible triage tasks in medicine let alone other pairwise categorical prioritization tasks."}, {"title": "Methods", "content": "Let's stipulate a multidimensional space P which describes each patient. Each dimension measures a patient's attribute (e.g. disease, medication, lab value, sex, age). Every patient, represented as a vector pi, has a position in P. For every pair of patients {pi, pj}, there is a function f (aka the triage function) which maps those two patients to the numbers 1 or 2. 1 signifies p\u2081 should be seen first by a clinician and 2 that pj should be seen first. The interactions between the dimensions P are extensive. For example, the priority given to the age dimension is highly dependent on values of the other dimensions. The interactions between dimensions in P are complex and extensive. For instance, the priority given to the age dimension heavily depends on the values of other dimensions. A 2-week-old with heart valve disease typically takes priority over a 50-year-old with the same condition, but a 6-year-old with mild dyslipidemia would likely be seen after a 50-year-old with untreated dyslipidemia. This complexity poses a significant challenge in finding or defining an implementation of f that is sound or acceptable for most patients or clinicians, even when considering only a few dimensions in P.\nWe will explore f as implemented by LLMs by asking the \u201cchat\u201d implementations of some \u201cfrontier\u201d LLMs to make the triage decision over a set of pairs {pi, pj}. Specifically, we will ask:\n\u2022 Q1: How concordant will an AI program with unspecified pre-training and alignment biases (i.e. \"out of the box\") be with a human's implementation of f in generating a set of decisions across a set of pairs of patients {Pi, Pj}?

One human physician examined those 200 pairs and assigned a 1 if they determined that the first patient should be seen first and 2 if the second patient should be seen first. This constituted the gold-standard decisions for Q1. GPT40 was then prompted to make the analogous decision for those same pairs. Concordance measures were calculated for the 200 decisions generated by f as defined by GPT40 vs the human and the discordant cases examined. This decision (and all the other decisions described below) was repeated a total of three times.

In this new gold standard G', all patients presenting with eye pain were given priority. Apart from this modification, all other procedures remained identical, and the same alignment measures were applied.\nWhile a comprehensive exploration of alignment changes across various gold standards could constitute a substantial study in itself, this single alteration to the gold standard proved sufficient to highlight several key insights. The limited scope of this perturbation allows us to efficiently demonstrate the sensitivity of LLM alignment to changes in the underlying value system, without necessitating an exhaustive examination of all possible variations."}, {"title": "Q6 Methods: Quantifying Alignment for the Triage Task", "content": "To quantify the concordance of the LLM for f with the gold standard of decisions, the vector G, two quantities will be estimated: First, the change in concordance AC with the gold standard (G) after alignment, and second, the change in the pairwise consistency AP between the runs of the LLM after alignment.

This was not done here for convenience, as it would require extensively sampling and a robust definition of which tasks are comparable to the one for which the ACI is being calculated.\nDefining the ACI\nWe now define a property of a specific LLM as it responds to an aligning process. This property, the Alignment Compliance Index (ACI) should be positive if the alignment process increases the concordance with the gold standard and/or increases the pairwise consistency between the runs. If the alignment process decreases either of these, the ACI should decrease.\nLet's define the ACI as:\nACI = (Cafter - Cbefore) + \u03bb\u00b7 (Pafter - Pbefore)   (5)\nwhere \u03bb is a weighting factor that balances the importance of pairwise consistency relative to concordance with the gold standard. Consequently, if Cafter > Cbefore, it means alignment improves concordance with G. If Pafter > Pbefore, this means alignment improves consistency between runs, and the second term is positive.\nIf we weight the pairwise concordance and the concordance with the gold standard equally (i.e., \u03bb=1), then the ACI = (Cafter - Cbefore) + (Pafter - Pbefore). If we then pick a concordance measure like Cohen's Kappa (\u043a) with a fixed range (-1 to 1 for k), then the range of ACI with \u03bb=1 is:\nACI \u2208 [-4,4]   (6)\nIn practice, for the triage task in this study, ACI ranges approximately between -0.5 to +1.0. In this study, ACI is calculated with \u5165=1 although cogent arguments could be made for other weightings."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "The description of the results will be written anthropomorphically for brevity.

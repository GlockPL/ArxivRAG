Sending mixed signals fails the contingency rule for developing affect regulation [3], and may result in confusion for students about their own emotions and hinder their emotion regulation. Therefore, being able to constructively regulate emotions not only benefits individual experience of emotions but also fosters effective interpersonal emotion regulation, and influences how a situation is managed [4]. MITHOS is a system aimed at training teachers' conflict resolution skills through realistic situative learning opportunities during classroom conflicts. In four stages, MITHOS supports teachers' socio-emotional self-awareness, perspective taking and positive regard. It provides a) a safe virtual environment to train free social interaction and receive natural social feedback from reciprocal student-agent reactions, b) spatial situational perspective taking through an avatar c) individual virtual reflection guidance on emotional experiences through co-regulation processes and d) expert feedback on professional behavioural strategies. This chapter presents the four stages and their implementation in a semi-automatic a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) System. The WoZ system affords collecting data that are used for developing the fully automated hybrid (machine learning and model-based) system, and to validate the underlying psychological and conflict resolution models We present results validating the approach in terms of scenario realism, as well as of a systematic testing of the effects of external avatar similarity on antecedents of self-awareness with behaviour similarity. The chapter contributes to a common methodology of conducting interdisciplinary research for human-centered and generalisable XR and presents a system to designed support it.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "In social interactions, people learn from each other through situative experiences. How others react to our behavior can provide rich situative social feedback about what needs to be adjusted. Emotions comprise important indicators on how to assess a situation and which options for action are available to us [5]. Teachers, similar to parents, hold a central role as multipliers of socio-emotional competence and behavior thereof, which takes place largely also through unaware socialisation processes [6, 7]. However, teachers often feel inadequately prepared to deal with complex socio-emotional challenges, such as those that can be triggered by heterogeneous learning groups or behavioral conflicts. The goal is to strengthen teachers' professional communication and empathic competence. To this end, effective methods for emotion regulation and conflict resolution are required [5, 8], which cannot be trained systematically and realistically in education. MITHOS, an Interactive Mixed Reality Training to Support Professional Socio-Emotional Interactions at Schools, examines the potential of an interactive mixed reality training to support the ability of teachers to emotionally assess conflict situations in the classroom and reevaluate possibilities for behaving with the students."}, {"title": "II. HUMAN-CENTERED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT", "content": "The human-centered and generalizable concept includes a novel combination of virtual-immersive and collaborative 3D environments, social signal analysis and synthesis of verbal, non-verbal and paraverbal behaviors to simulate interactive virtual agents. Together, this allows for realistic training. MITHOS, as a first project, enables the real-time exchange of social signals between humans and agents in a teaching setting, including natural implicit social feedback, as well as the coupling of virtual and real-world experiences. It thus simulates socio-emotional co-regulation.\n\nThe implementation is done in two versions: 1) Wizard of Oz (WoZ) System (5), and 2) Automated System. The WoZ (Wizard of Oz) system is designed to empirically test and validate separate aspects of the behavior modeling and to collect data for developing the Automated System. The collected multimodal audio-visual data is used to develop a hybrid affect model, which utilizes both machine learning and theory-based reasoning models to decipher the situational emotional experience. This model is designed to process speech, gaze, pose, facial expression and natural language dialog, represented as an Interaction Act, that is a representation structure defined and used to understand the teacher's behavior and emotional experience using computational models of affect, namely ALMA [21] and structured psychodynamic diagnostic models [22]. The planned affect model then automatically generates appropriate student responses over multiple dialog turns. In the current WoZ system, the analysis is performed in real-time by a wizard trained to evaluate the teacher's behavior and the evaluation is automatically converted into suitable multimodal animation commands by the system. The main advantage of using psychodynamic models and deep modeling for co-regulation training lies in the long-term effectiveness for well-being and happiness, which goes beyond the treatment of symptoms. In this regard, psychodynamic methods are more suitable for interaction modeling, which does not target specific symptoms but generally observable, but relatively stable motives on a personal level, as described in the OPD (Operational Psychodynamic Diagnostic)[23].\n\nThe MITHOS training, afforded by both the WoZ and the final Automated system, is anchored in the teacher training university programme of studies for systematic"}, {"title": "III. XR IN LEARNING, TEACHER EDUCATION, CONFLICT AND ITS RESOLUTION", "content": "Current research in the field of virtual 3D learning and simulation environments has shown that the use of this technology can have great potential for learning and training effects [24, 25]. In teacher training, for example, MR is used to offer prospective teachers opportunities to practice strategic situational action in a protected environment [26]. It has been shown that 3D learning and simulation environments with virtual interactive agents have high potential for social and emotional learning. Fields of application include preparing for lectures with the help of a virtual audience [27],\n\nPrevious MR approaches in conflict training [26], in which student reactions are taken from actors and are scripted, show advantages for authentic experiences, but have problems with credibility and personalized training. The perception of one's own needs and emotional arousal play a very important role here [28]. In addition to AI methods, group awareness tools (GATs) combined with behavioral support can highlight communication characteristics, support group processes and perspective taking and interaction in learning contexts [29, 30, 31]. In the training of teachers, knowledge about social interaction [32] and the perception and interpretation of cognitive and emotional processes [33] are particularly important. In order to successfully train these skills, an adequate theory-to-practice connection is essential. (Video-based) case vignettes are often used for corresponding training [34], but also virtual training [35, 36]. Another important aspect of training is feedback [37], which usefully consists of an immediate and a delayed component [38]. This allows teachers to learn to decide quickly and flexibly on a reaction (immediate feedback) as well as to rethink complex conditions within a challenging situation [39].\n\nWhile there are previous existing projects focusing on providing a safe learning environment, their focus is mostly on training knowledge acquisition and teaching strategies [40, 41, 42]. MITHOS stands out as it focuses on training socio-emotional skills and classroom management. MITHOS emphasizes the importance of respectful and professional interactions in a classroom"}, {"title": "IV. SITUATIONAL INTERACTION FOR TRAINING PROFESSIONAL RESPECTFUL CONFLICT RESOLUTION", "content": "Acquiring socio-emotional skills influences communication skills and professional behavior [43] and contributes to health and well-being [44, 45]. During social interactions, reactions are determined based on the appraisal of perceived emotional reactions of others [46]. This may increase their awareness of their behavior during high arousal situations, i.e. the initiated conflict. Self-awareness brings attention to not only one's own emotions and needs, but also that of the others. By increasing self-awareness, a person is more likely to adopt adaptive regulating strategies [47].\n\nPerspective taking also enhances one's ability to empathize [48]. High arousal levels may reduce the ability of perspective taking and trigger the switch of emotion regulation to automatic response through fight or flight. This switch may be influenced by different factors such as previous internal conflicts [49]. In MITHOS, we induce self-focused attention through the replay of the interaction on an avatar to foster self-awareness and perspective taking (Training Stage 2). Based on previous empirical research [50] to ensure fostering perspective taking a cue to the other's perspective has to be present. In MITHOS, teachers watch a replay of the interaction from the perspective of the student, watching their own expressions on an avatar. Previous studies have shown that using a generic avatar is not sufficient and a personalized avatar is a prerequisite for increasing self-awareness [51]. Personalized avatars are used as they increase the feeling of being self-represented and emotionally attached to the visually similar avatar stimulus.\n\nIn a previous study, we investigated the effect of different degrees of similarity and the necessity to include expensive similar avatars for perspective taking in MITHOS. We conducted a study defining three conditions by manipulating specific facial features of the virtual avatar [52]. The results show that perceived similarity is influenced by two degrees of manipulations of avatar-person similarity. This allows some room for error in studies when designing personalized avatars. However, the right degree of manipulation is required for explicit identification with the avatar. Therefore, here we further investigate the added value of personalized avatars for increasing self-awareness. We compare two different conditions, watching the replay of one's behaviour on a generic default avatar compared to a personalized avatar of maximum possible similarity using"}, {"title": "V. INTERACTION SIMULATION STAGE", "content": "The MITHOS-Training, whether WoZ system or Final Automated System, takes place in four main training Stages: 1. First situative training stage, 2. Avatar-replay stage, 3. Agent-feedback stage and 4. Expert-feedback stage. All stages together aim at increasing the teacher's awareness and ability of perspective taking, and training social interaction with a conflict scenario in an interactive classroom.\n\nIn a situative training stage, teachers train social interaction with an interactive classroom conflict scenario. They hold a class in front of a virtual classroom where a conflict is initiated through the behavior of one of the virtual students. The teacher is required to involve the student in the lesson and guide them to pay attention, in a professional and respectful way. The virtual student reactions are implemented reciprocally and are multimodal, to reflect different communication channels that include verbal and non-verbal, as well as explicit and implicit signals in the interaction. Through the signals, the teacher's implicit emotional awareness increases. Implicit emotional awareness is non-effortful attention to one's emotional experiences which directly influences one's emotion regulation and in turn the conflict potential in the interaction. The next Stages provide feedback (implicit and explicit) and train the teacher to be more professional. In the avatar-replay stage of the interaction, teachers use an explicit emotion awareness tool, implemented as a virtual agent who plays back their verbal and non-verbal behavior during the interaction. This allows them to take the physical perspective of the students and observe their reactions, to increase their awareness of the student's emotional perspective. In the agent-feedback stage, the teacher reflects on their experience with the help of a virtual training agent in a process of co-regulation. The agent supports, through compassionate reactions to the emotional experience of the teacher. Compassion complements explicit emotional awareness [76] as it reduces personal distress [77]. Finally, in the expert-feedback stage, the teacher gets verbal feedback from experts on positive regard as an important aspect on professional conflict regulation in the classroom."}, {"title": "A. Training stage 1 Situative training stage", "content": "This stage provides an interactive virtual platform for the teacher to experience dealing with complex socio-emotional challenges, such as those that can be triggered by heterogeneous learning groups or behavioral conflicts. During this stage, the teacher holds a class in front of a virtual classroom where a conflict is initiated through the behavior of one virtual student. The interaction is structured in four conflict phases to account for different phases of conflict resolution [8, 71], Figure 2. The virtual student's behavior during the whole interaction with the teacher is modeled, based on a turn-by-turn evaluation of the teacher behavior on two dimensions, task and relationship conflict level [71], and a matrix of conflict regulation potential ranging from -2 (low conflict potential) to +2 (high conflict potential) [78]1. The student reaction is based on the assessed conflict resolution style of the teacher. The conflict resolutions style comprises two levels: Task and Relationship [8]. The model penalise (-1) or reward (+1) the teacher behaviour at both levels locally for each turn, and a global conflict level status is updated accordingly. The conflict level status is based on an ordered list which represent the conflict escalation potential of the conflict resolution style and connect the teacher behaviour to the student reaction.

This is dependent on the internal conflict initially assigned to the virtual student and the behavior of the teacher. Based on the conflict regulation strategies, the teacher may attempt to resolve the situation in 5 different ways: withdraw, force, problem solve, smooth and compromise [90]. Although compromising has been shown to be effective in conflict regulation, it stems from comparing one's interest against the other rather than considering both"}, {"title": "VII.

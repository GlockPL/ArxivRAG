Define a\nuniverse $\\Omega$ as the set of all possible states w. Define a state was a set of state-specific\ntrue statements (also called formulas or sentences) $\\xi$. States marry context and facts.\nThe universe, therefore, is a complete and contextualized set of facts. For instance,\n$\\xi$ =\"the sky is cloudy\" may hold in state w\u2081 but not in state w2. Facts associated with\nstates can be characterized as simple sets.\nBy construing the $\\xi$ as statements and the w as sets of statements we are adopting\nthe analytical perspective pioneered by Samet (1990). Aumann (1999a, p. 266) has\nadopted Samet's formalism, describing it as \"the simple but ingenious and fundamental\nidea of formally characterizing a state of the world by the sentences that hold there.\"\nSamet's formalism begins with a countable set of propositions and a countable set I\nof individuals. For each such individual, i, there is a knowledge function $K_i : \\Phi \\to \\Phi$.\nIf $\\xi \\in \\Phi$, then $K_i \\xi$ means \"i knows $\\xi$.\" Samet's crucial move was then to define the\nfunction $\\Sigma = {0, 1}$. Each element of $\\Sigma$ can be thought of as an assignment of truth\nvalues to the propositions: 1 for 'true' and 0 for 'false.' This move allows him to define a\n\u201cstate of the world\u201d w as any element of $\\Sigma$ that satisfies the condition $w(\\xi) + w(\\neg\\xi) = 1$,\nthat is, the observed states of the world cannot be true and false at the same time. This\nsubset of $\\Sigma$ is called the event space, $\\Omega_{\\rho}$. By this \"simple but ingenious\" method, Samet\nmoves from a set of propositions about the world to a countably infinite event space.\nIndividuals are endowed with partitions of states of the universe and associate the\npartitions with events to form a cause-and-effect belief calculus. The partitions I of\neach individual are fixed and are common knowledge.

The set of all sentences\nis called the syntax S. Beyond these elements, the formal epistemology of OEE systems\ndiffers from that of CE systems. Recall that theorizing in CE systems is from the\nperspective of an external expert on behalf of other individuals, who presumes there\nexists a theory-of-everything To of the system $\\Omega$ in the language L for the universe in\nwhich all realizable states are composed of true sentences and where sentences must be\ncoherent and complete such that there are no undecidable disjunctions in the theory,\ni.e., no ontological truths that cannot be proved true within the epistemological theory.\nThe primary considerations of OEE systems are that:\n1. Theorizing is from the perspective of the embedded observer, who cannot a priori\nimpose their perspective of reality on other agents.\n2. By virtue of open-endedness, OEE knowledge theory necessitates an individual-\nlevel process of continual theory revision.\n3. Unbounded and innovative processes in OEE systems tend to grow the number of\npossibilities in the system.\n4. Formulating knowledge theory using propositional logic in CE models leaves open\nquestions of how a theory of the universe $\\Tau o$ is constructed to be decidable and\nhow the theory used by each individual i at time t, $T_{i,t}$, relates to $\\Tau o$ and to\nindividual j's theory of the universe $T_{j,t}$.\nConsideration (1) localizes knowledge acquisition and use to the individual with respect\nto the individual's epistemic environment and their conception of their system at a\ngiven time, t. Call the individual's known-world $N_{i,t}$. The individual understands their\nknown-world as a model $M_{i,t}$ defined within a theory $T_{i,t}$. The individual's syntax for\ntheir known-world is $S_{i,t}$.

The theory $T_{i,t}$ no\nlonger sufficiently describes the logical relationships between sentences of $\\xi\\in N_{i,t+1}$ as\nit is now incomplete. The new observed states may have logically extended $T_{i,t}$ or con-\ntradicted old axioms, rendering $T_{i,t}$ inconsistent. In general, i must select a new theory\n$T_{i,t+1}$.\nRemark. We essentially define time-periods t in terms of the perceived applicability by\nindividual i at time t of a theory $T_{i,t}$. Our definition differs from how t is defined\nin discrete-dynamical theories of economic growth, business cycles, and in agent-based\ncomputational economics. Actual agent dynamics may contain entire worlds inside each\ntemporal cross-section. Within cross-sections, rational agents may employ static and\nsimplified theories like deterministic search over apparent landscapes of possibilities.\n$T_{i,t}$ is a map with which i to can reasonably navigate a temporal cross-section.\nConsideration (3) constructs the novelty-generating processes of possibility spaces in\nOEE systems as innovative and unbounded in growth. This implies that $|\\Omega_{i,t+1}| > |N_{i,t}|$\nin general. Logically, in terms of individuals formulating languages of their known-worlds\nin which they then theorize about their world, a continual increase in possibilities means\na continual addition to the set of all possible qualities, objects or characteristics (as\nopposed to merely altering the value of a variable). In epistemology, this is called the\nset $P_{i,t}$ of all nonlogical constants $P_k$ (as opposed to logical constants, which are mostly\noperators and relationships). It is the continual growth $|P_{i,t+1}| > |P_{i,t}|$ that drives the\nneed for theory revision in OEE systems.\nWe can now define the possible $I_{i,t}$ for individual i at time t in an OEE system\nas a triplet of the set of nonlogical constants $P_{i,t}$, the theory $T_{i,t}$ of the cause-and-effect\nstructure of the universe, and a decision-theoretic model $M_{i,t}$ consistent $T_{i,t}$.

Open-ended evolution is es-\nsentially the intended or unintended movement into the adjacent possible. Unlike in\nCE knowledge theory, as we shall discuss below, there is no way to logically deduce\nrealizable paths across OEE landscapes.\nConsideration (4) localizes knowledge use and acquisition further, stressing that per-\nception in the form of theorizing and not just observation is local to the embedded ob-\nserver. All theories are accompanied by a set of undecidable disjunctions that an individ-\nual must resolve one way or another when encountered in a choice context (the existence\nof these undecidable disjunctions is an implication of G\u00f6delian incompleteness that we\nwill discuss at greater length below).

This assumption is analogous to the standard rationality assumption\nemployed in economic decision theories and was included in order to demonstrate that\neven if we assume individuals are perfectly rational, knowledge use and acquisition in\nOEE systems has a different character and set of implications than the epistemic logic\nsupporting CE rational choice models."}, {"title": "A formalism for the construction of OEE knowledge", "content": "As in CE knowledge theory, our OEE knowledge framework models individual compre-\nhension of the system as state perception and observation to construct a cause-and-effect\ncalculus and thus a theory of the known-world that applies to all known possibilities.\nIndividual i expects the real states they encounter w \u2208 \u03a9 to be descriptive of their"}, {"title": null, "content": "known-world $i_{s,t}$ with respect to their current theory of the known-world $T_{i,t}$.

In an OEE system,\nindividual i must determine what constitutes their state-specific and non-state-specific\nknowledge at each step in time. At time t, individual i forms hypotheses and gathers\n\"facts\". \"Facts\" are hypotheses i believes to have been correctly inferred or deduced in\ntheory $T_{i,t}$ according to a model $M_{i,t}$ of the known-universe $N_{i,t}$. Hypotheses are as-yet-\nundecided statements with an unknown true/false valuation. This means that i must\nemploy a decision procedure in $T_{i,t}$ that can settle the truth of any new predicate so it\ncan enter into their knowledge.\nOpen-ended evolution thrusts i into a state-space $N_{i,t+1}$ which contains predicates\n$P\\in P_{i,t+1}$ and thus sentences $\\xi' \\in \\omega'$ for w\u02b9 \u2208 $N_{i,t+1}$ outside the domain of $\\delta_{i,t}$. How,\nthen, does an individual update her local knowledge as the system evolves in an open-\nended manner?\nAny states that fall outside the realm of possibility $K_{i,t}$ for the individual must\ncontain sentences $\\xi\u2019$ for which $\\delta_{i,t}$ cannot decide the truth value. Define the adjacent\nknowledge possible $A_{i,t}$ for individual i at time t as the quotient of the adjacent\n\u201cknowledge possible\u201d $K_{i,t+1}$ with the current possibility set $K_{i,t+1}$, where $A_{i,t} = K_{i,t+1} \\setminus$"}, {"title": null, "content": "$K_{i,t} = {\\omega' : \\omega' \\in K_{i,t+1},\\omega' \\notin K_{i,t}}$.\nIn OEE systems, the state-level adjacent possible $A_{i,t}$ is non-empty (Proposition 5),\nwhich follows from how we defined OEE systems.\nThe two components of an individual's possibility space in OEE systems are gener-\nated by an individual's contextual and temporal local-ness. The contextual knowledge\npossible $K_{i,t}$ is generated by freeze-framing an individual's evolution and is equivalent\nto the definition of the possible in traditional epistemology (Samet 1990: 193). The\nadjacent knowledge possible $A_{i,t}$ is generated by moving between one known-world $N_{i,t}$\nand the next $2_{i,t+1}$. $A_{i,t}$ is defined for $w_{i,t+1}$.\nA key part of obtaining predictive dynamics in CE knowledge theory is establishing\nthat states of the world w \u2208 \u03a9 as seen by the individual are consistent (see Definition\n1), coherent (see Definition 2) and complete (see Definition 3) (Aumann 1999a: 276,\nSamet 1990). States w \u2208 $N_{i,t}$ in OEE systems do not in general exhibit such analytically\nnice properties with respect to all w \u2208 \u03a9. While states in OEE systems are defined as\nlocally consistent, complete and coherent and are provably coherent at the individual\nlevel (for all states \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9), they are not consistent or complete at the system level\n(see Theorem 2 in the Appendix). The system-level coherence of local knowledge in\nOEE systems is implied by the assumption of local completeness, local consistency and\nlocal coherence without the need to assume individuals possess the full theory of the\nuniverse. Coherence allows individuals to categorize phenomena and make decisions\nconsistent with their current theoretical understanding. An implication of the coherence\nof local knowledge is that in slower-changing contexts, individuals can engage in cross-\nsectional error correction and iteratively progress towards a better understanding of their\nknown-world. Faster-changing contexts degrade the relative efficacy of error correction\nenabled by local coherence.\nNext we demonstrate that in OEE systems, within-observer knowledge is funda-\nmentally incomplete and between-agent knowledge is fundamentally disjoint. Consider\nthe following example. An observer i can only distinguish between two states in their\nknown-world if the local knowledge sets of those two states are different. If their cause-\nand-effect partition associates the observation \"it is cloudy\" to a particular state but not\nto another, then the knowledge that \"it is cloudy\" allows them to distinguish between\nthe two states. However, if they cannot distinguish between the two states then either\nit is not cloudy or the observer can't tell (doesn't know) if it is cloudy.\nCause-and-effect partitions $I_{i,t}$ of $Nit$ are defined with respect to the contextual\nknowledge possible $K_{i,t}$. Due to the OEE nature of the system (and G\u00f6delian incom-\npleteness) there will always exist a sentence $\\xi$ that is possible in $\\Omega$ but not decidable by"}, {"title": null, "content": "the decision procedure $\\delta_{i,t}$ (see Proposition 5 and Lemma 1). Therefore, individual-level\npartitions of \u03a9 must always be incomplete.\nHeterogeneity in $K_{it}$ can be explained by computational complexity, open-endedness,\nindividual characteristics like entrepreneurial ability and alertness, and endogenously\nrandom factors (the creative importance of time and place). Felin (2022) describes the\nactual environment of human choice as a rich unmappable landscape, whereby individu-\nals are embedded in \u201c[o]rganism-specific, teeming environments.\u201d Individual worlds $\\Omega_{i,t}$\ndetermine local knowledge and, in OEE choice contexts, $N_{i,t} \\neq \\Omega_{j,t}$. Thus, different\nindividuals in OEE systems have different minds. In CE systems, different individuals\nhave one mind. We prefer many-minds theorizing to one-mind theorizing.\nConjecture 1. (Disjointness) Under open-ended evolution, local knowledge is at least\npartially disjoint at any cross section of time and between cross sections. That is, $K_{i,t} \\neq$\n$K_{j,t}$ in general for i, j \u2208 N, t \u2208 T.\nProof. (Sketch) Suppose individuals i and j perceive the same possibility spaces $K_{i,t} =$\n$K_{j,t}$. Then, this implies they share theories of the universe $T_{i,t} = T_{j,t}$ and that they\nperceive the same known-worlds $\\Omega_{i,t} = \\Omega_{j,t}$. Suppose i encounters a new predicate in\ntheir adjacent possible that j does not. Then, at time t + 1, $T_{i,t+1} \\neq T_{j,t+1}$. This is not\ntoo much of a problem if j updates their theory in the same way, but this likely requires\ntheory convergence in the face of vast combinatorial complexity generated by open-ended\nprocesses. As proved in the Appendix (Theorem 1), we cannot generally claim theory\nconvergence in OEE systems. Therefore, it is reasonable to claim the general partial\ndisjointness of individual knowledge in OEE systems.\nThe incompleteness of knowledge partitions in OEE systems constrains what we\ncan say about the strategic arithmetic of interactions between individuals. In general,\n$K_{i,t} \\neq K_{j,t}$ for i,j \u2208 N,t \u2208T. The Disjointness Conjecture implies that however\nindividuals coordinate with each other to realize common social goals, it is not through\nthe automatic knowing of the needs, worldviews and goals of others. This suggests a\npossible role for institutions like religion, culture, and aesthetics to encode worldviews\nindividuals can adopt in common.

Theoretical innovation is a process of\nobserver-specific \u201cbecoming\" into new possibilities through time rather than atemporal\nreflection."}, {"title": "Common knowledge under open-ended evolution (OEE2 & OEE3)", "content": "An information set under open-ended evolution is the set of states in $N_{i,t}$ that individual\ni cannot distinguish from one another, or\n$I(\\omega) := {\\omega' \\in N_{i,t} : k_{i,t}(\\omega') = k_{i,t}(W)}$"}, {"title": null, "content": "The information partition $I_{i", "T_{i,t}$": "individuals will\nnot in general have access to the same \"dictionary\" of states.\nWe're now ready to address Result OEE2: Common knowledge is generally impossible\nin an open-ended evolutionary system.\nIn traditional epistemology, a knowledge hierarchy of the world is formed"}]}

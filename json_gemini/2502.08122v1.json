Our system is seamlessly integrated into Hookpad, a web-based editor designed for composition of lead sheets-symbolic music scores that describes melody and harmony. Hookpad Aria has numerous generation capabilities designed to assist users in non-sequential composition workflows, including: (1) generating left-to-right continuations of existing material, (2) filling in missing spans in the middle of existing material, and (3) generating harmony from melody and vice versa. Hookpad Aria is also a scalable data flywheel for music co-creation. since its release in March 2024, Aria has generated 318k suggestions for 3k users who have accepted 74k into their songs.", "sections": [{"title": "1. INTRODUCTION", "content": "Recently, a growing body of research on generative models has yielded impressive music generation capabilities in both symbolic [1-6] and acoustic [7-14] domains. These models offer tremendous potential to enrich and accelerate music creation via integration with existing workflows.\nBeyond the music domain, generative models have been integrated into various creative workflows, including video editing [15], 3D modeling [16], story writing [17], and programming [18]. These integrations have been shown to support the creation process effectively-studies with users of GitHub Copilot, a prominent AI programming assistant, indicate that the tool not only enhances productivity but also enjoyment and satisfaction in the process [19].\nHoping to offer similar benefits to musicians, who are currently (and understandably) skeptical about AI [20], here we aim to integrate generative models into the workflows of songwriters. Specifically, we build a Copilot-like system called Hookpad Aria, an integration of state-of-the-art symbolic music generation capabilities into Hookpad, a popular web editor designed for songwriting (in the last month, 7k Hookpad users wrote 33k songs). Hookpad supports the composition of lead sheets, symbolic musical scores that describe melody and harmony-the essence of a piece of Western pop music. Our system aims to seamlessly integrate with Hookpad to support the specific needs of songwriters on that platform. In contrast, past work proposes new workflows [21, 22] rather than integrating with existing ones, or focuses on different platforms [23-25]. Unlike past work, we also aim to collect interaction data from users, with the goal of supporting future research efforts. Users explicitly opt in to data collection when they first use Hookpad Aria-to date we have collected implicit feedback on 318k suggestions from 3k unique users. Additionally, we report findings from interviews with eight Hookpad Aria users to gain insights into their experiences, perceptions, and how they engage with the tool."}, {"title": "2. \u041d\u041e\u041e\u041aPAD ARIA", "content": "System design. The design of Hookpad Aria centers around two key principles. Firstly, we aim to support songwriters in non-sequential workflows. Accordingly, we designed our system to offer unprecedented control capabilities for symbolic music generation. In addition to sequential left-to-right generation, we support fill-in-the-middle, harmonization from melody, and generating melodies from harmony (Figure 1). Past work on symbolic music generation offers some of these features but not all [2, 21-23,26].\nSecondly, inspired by the seamless integrations of tools like Github Copilot into code editors, we aim to seamlessly integrate our system into Hookpad. We repurpose the familiar measure selection workflow to allow users to select regions of a song to generate. Users specify if they want to generate melody, harmony, or both for the selected span, conditioned both on surrounding local context as well as global attributes (meter, key, and tempo) of their project. Hookpad Aria displays endless alternative generations from Aria for a single span, which users can audit until finding one they wish to \"accept\" into their track. We log whether suggestions are accepted or ignored as implicit feedback data-74k have been accepted to date.\nLLM backbone. Hookpad Aria is based on the Anticipatory Music Transformer [5], a state-of-the-art large language model pre-trained for multi-instrumental symbolic music generation. The Anticipatory Music Transformer is capable of both standard autoregressive (left-to-right) generation conditioned on preceding context, and also has the capability to fill-in-the-middle based on both preceding and subsequent context. To adapt this model to our setting, we fine tune the \"medium\" pre-trained model (360m pa-"}, {"title": "3.

RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES", "content": "The scalable data flywheel created by Aria offers many potential avenues for future research, such as aligning models to user feedback [27], A/B testing different generative models for in-the-wild evaluation [28], and producing interaction datasets that help us to better study the nature of human-AI music co-creation [29]. We plan to explore these in future work."}]}

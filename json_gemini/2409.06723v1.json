Generative AI (GenAI) offers possibilities for supporting creative writing activities, such as providing story generation. However, the design of GenAI-powered learning technologies requires careful consideration of the technology reception in the actual classrooms. This study explores students' and teachers' perceptions of creative mathematical writing with the developed GenAI-powered technology. The study adopted a qualitative thematic analysis of the interviews, triangulated with open-ended survey responses and classroom observation of 79 elementary school students, resulting in six themes and 19 subthemes. This study contributes by investigating the lived experience of GenAI-supported learning and the design considerations for GenAI-powered learning technologies and instructions.", "sections": [{"title": "I. Introduction", "content": "Creative writing is an expression of fiction or non-fiction stories that encompass narratives, characters, emotional evocation, and thought provocation (Wise & Luyn, 2020). Creative writing is often used as a pedagogical strategy, allowing students to understand, construct, synthesize, and elaborate on learned knowledge with their cultural inspirations (Bloom, 1956; Wills, 1993). The importance and potential of creative writing's role in supporting learning have been increasingly discussed (Colonnese et al., 2018; Firmender et al., 2017). Elementary Mathematical Writing Task Force has emphasized mathematical writing suggesting mathematical creativity as a goal of mathematical communication and reasoning (Firmender et al., 2017). Creative writing in mathematics encourages students to document their original and creative stories that convey mathematical concepts, ideas, problems, and solutions, enhancing fluent and flexible thinking skills (Casa et al., 2016). However, young students or students with special needs have difficulty engaging in such creative writing activities, especially when lacking supporting tools and resources (Colonnese et al., 2018).\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) brings new and varied opportunities to support students' creative writing activities in mathematics. For instance, students could collaborate with AI to ignite their creative writing journey creating a less intimidating experience than starting from scratch. AI could provide an initial spark to kickstart story generation through customized prompts reflecting individual learners' cultural backgrounds, interests, and preferences. In this process, GenAI-powered agents could provide scaffolding for students to use mathematical language, encouraging them to expand their stories through creativity and imagination (Zhang et al, 2024). Storytelling captures and maintains the learner's attention, increasing interest and motivation (Hava, 2021), and supporting math language learning and story creation performance (Zhang et al., 2024).\nAlthough the diverse roles of AI in creating mathematical writing and its benefits in the K-12 learning context have been explored, designing and implementing effective Al-assisted creative mathematics writing solutions face challenges. These challenges include overreliance on AI-generated content (Kim et al., 2024a; Chan & Hu, 2023), reduced opportunities for social learning and peer/teacher feedback (Zimmerman et al., 2023; Guilherme, 2019), and exposure to inappropriate content (Kim et al., 2024a). To better address such limitations, maximize the pedagogical benefits of creative mathematical writing, and effectively take advantage of GenAI technologies, it is important to account for both students' and teachers' perspectives of the lived reality of the classroom and their needs on the ground to"}, {"title": "II. Literature review", "content": "Traditional classroom settings often rely on the \u201cchalk-and-talk\" teaching environment. In mathematics education, these settings tend to prioritize accuracy practice and finding the \u201cright\u201d answer over fostering deep understanding (Freire, 2020), exploring underlying concepts, or encouraging creative thinking. Moreover, in a traditional math classroom, most students, particularly low-performing ones, have limited opportunities to act as designers or tutors or to engage in the creative process of mathematics (Dewsbury, 2020), which in turn negatively impacts academic performance and self-regulated learning (Kim et al., 2024b), broadening disparities among students (Byers et al., 2018).\nIn line with this, creative mathematical writing has been proposed as an effective learner-\ncentered pedagogy. Mann (2006) also described mathematical creative writing as the essence of mathematics that engages students in advanced mathematical thinking and learning. Engaging students in creative mathematical writing could create immersive and contextual learning scenarios where students can act as designers and owners of their stories (Kim & Lee, 2023). In addition, these activities stimulate deeper cognitive processing and retention, helping students understand complex thoughts and ideas while having fun (Kim & Cho, 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). For instance, student-generated real-life math stories can facilitate the identification and representation of mathematical relationships, making abstract concepts more tangible and understandable (Overholt et al., 2008)."}, {"title": "2.2. Educational Benefits and Challenges of GenAI-supported Writing", "content": "GenAI generates new content (e.g., texts, images, audio) similar to existing data by learning the features and patterns of that data (Su & Yang, 2023). Research demonstrates that using GenAI (e.g., text-to-image AI) significantly boosts human creative productivity and increases the value of the content (Zhou & Lee, 2024). ChatGPT usage in writing can significantly raise writing productivity by generating text content (Kim et al., 2024a). Its capabilities in improving language and proofreading are well-established (Shopovski, 2024), making AI-generated content trustable with appropriate monitoring and revision (Kim et al., 2024a).\nRecently, attempts have been made to integrate GenAI into educational scenarios to support creative writing activities. For example, the educational software, \"Plotagon,\" allows students to create Al-generated visualizations for stories, blending creative writing with language learning (Guzm\u00e1n G\u00e1mez & Moreno Cuellar, 2019). In mathematics education, Zhang et al. (2024) introduced \u201cMathemyths,\" a joint storytelling agent that co-creates stories with children, integrating mathematical terms into the evolving narrative. A user study involving 35 children aged 4-8 years indicated that interactions with \"Mathemyths\" improved learning outcomes for mathematical language that were comparable to those achieved when co-creating stories with a human partner. GenAI can also enrich narrative development and offer new perspectives in storytelling, and using AI as a pedagogical tool can provide qualitative educational benefits, encouraging further research into AI-assisted learning strategies in education (Wafa et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "III. Research methods", "content": "We conducted classroom studies to implement our GenAI-powered learning technology in six classrooms led by six elementary school teachers with 79 5th-grade students across two United States (US) schools. One school, located on the West Coast of the US, involved four class sessions, each session lasting 45-60 minutes, covering fraction division in math with three teachers and fifty-seven students. The other school, located in the Southeast US, involved two classes spanning eight sessions, each lasting 35 minutes, covering multiplications of fractions in math with three teachers and 22 students. Teacher participants included five females and one male. The demographic breakdowns of the students included 50 girls, 56 boys, one non-binary, and five chose not to say. In addition, 36 students identified themselves as White, 10 as Asian, eight as Black/African American, three as Native American/Alaska Native/First Nations, and two as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Sixteen students selected 'self-specify,' and answers couldn't be categorized into any of the provided options (e.g., Mexican; Brazilian), while 10 chose not to specify. As participants were allowed to select more than one category, the total count of selections exceeded the"}, {"title": "3.2. Instruction and Learning Technology", "content": "We followed a three-step instruction to support students' creative mathematical writing, conceptualized as Ask, Represent, and Transform. First, in the Ask step, students are asked questions related to the math stories provided to them, break down the math stories, and deeply understand the math ideas behind the stories. For example, there is a story titled \"Garden Traditions with Abuela,\" as follows:\n\"Sofia was excited for Saturday. She planned to help her Abuela (grandmother) plant some zucchinis and tomatillos in her garden. ... When she arrived at the garden, her Abuela had already plated \u00bc of a row of zucchinis and suggested that Sofia wait until she finished planting zucchinis and help her with planting tomatillos. If it took Abuela 6 minutes to plant \u00bd of a row of zucchinis, how long will it take her to plant 1 row of zucchinis?\"\nAfter reading this story, students are prompted to answer the following questions: \u201cWhat is the story about?\" \"What else do you wonder about the story?\u201d and \u201cDescribe or select the math ideas in the story\u201d\nIn the Represent step, students are encouraged to model their mental representations of the possible solutions, utilizing different visual tools provided by the platform. They are provided with an empty canvas they can fill with different shapes, symbols, and texts\nFinally, in the Transform step, the GenAI technology supports students in drafting, modifying, and creating their culturally relevant math stories. In this stage, students take on the role of a director by providing story ideas and goals (i.e., math-related goals or a math equation the story aims to convey), character (i.e., the main character of the story), settings (i.e., the major plot for the story), and event (i.e., the basic outline of the story including what is happening in the story related to math ideas)\nIn this example, the student wrote the goal to be \u201c3/5 X 15 = 9, \" the character to be \"Kimberly,\" and the setting to be \u201cPizza shop.\u201d The event and math problem are written as \u201cKimberly loves to eat pizza. She ate \u00b3/s of a giant pizza. She is full but she wants to eat the rest of the pizza.\u201d Based\non the student's input, GenAI created a story draft, as shown on the right-hand side\n\"Kimberly, a big pizza lover, goes to her favorite pizza shot after school each day.

Findings", "content": "Thematic analysis of the interviews with students and teachers resulted in six themes and nineteen sub-\nthemes, including four themes with 12 sub-themes on the benefits of creative mathematical writing with\nGenAI (RQ1) and two themes with seven sub-themes on the challenges of GenAI-assisted creative\nwriting (RQ2)."}, {"title": "4.1. Students' and teachers' perceived benefits of creative mathematical writing with GenAI", "content": "Creative mathematical writing with GenAI helps foster creativity in math. First, the support of GenAI\nwas found to promote students' divergent thinking in creative writing. Divergent thinking means\nproducing as many ideas as possible for an open-ended problem without worrying about judgment\n(Razumnikova, 2020). Students felt less pressure on the writing task as GenAI provided the draft for them\nto realize their initial ideas without an intense commitment, time, and energy consumption, which helped\nthem make multiple attempts to create divergent stories. On the other hand, GenAI also provides support\nfor convergent thinking. Convergent thinking refers to refining ideas into one (correct or most\nappropriate) solution (Razumnikova, 2020). In our study, GenAI provided a single story as a draft by\nputting together students' divergent ideations and trials. This process gives students a hint on how to\ncorrect, expand, and improve their writing, focusing on important mathematical concepts. Third, GenAI\ncan promote students' original creation of mathematical stories. GenAI allows students to input their own\nideas as prompts and create original stories for everyone. Students appreciate the originality GenAI\nprovided and incorporate it into their original stories. Lastly, GenAI promotes students' fluent and\nflexible thinking in mathematical problem-solving. Students infused mathematical ideas into the story and\nprovided possible solutions to the story. As the stories generated by AI are not as structured as students'\nwritten stories, students could come up with multiple math problems and solutions to one story. Contrary\nto the previous literature and common concerns about GenAI's risk of reducing creativity (Shidiq, 2023),\nthis theme suggests that GenAI supports various aspects of creativity, such as divergent thinking,\nconvergent thinking, originality, and flexibility. This finding supports the current discussion on the\npotential of GenAI in enhancing students' creative writing in mathematics by helping with character\ndevelopment, setting description, and narrative development (Nouari et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "4.1.2 Fostering mathematical understanding", "content": "Creative mathematical writing with GenAI helps students to foster mathematical understanding. First,\nboth students and teachers reported that their learning experience enhanced students' abilities to\nunderstand the problem.

In this study, we found that students utilized different prompt engineering strategies,\nwhich is an important competency needed to work with GenAI (Knoth et al., 2024). While collaboratively\nwriting math stories with AI, students naturally learned the importance of prompt engineering and\ninternalized better prompt engineering strategies by trial and error. This finding resonates with Woo and\ncolleagues' (2022) finding that secondary students tried different input units (i.e., words, sentences, or\nparagraphs) in their creative writing work with AI. This activity is an essential part of AI literacy in that it\npromotes better use of AI and valuable learning of how to evaluate AI's strengths and weaknesses (Long\n& Magerko, 2020).

Studies raised concerns about students' overreliance on AI-generated content and\naccepting it without critical examination, which could yield inaccurate, unethical, or low-quality writing\n(Chan & Hu, 2023). However, even with high-performing AI that can provide accurate and high-quality\ncontent, students' examination of the AI-generated content and editing and restructuring of the content"}, {"title": "4.2.2 AI-related", "content": "Students and teachers expressed many AI-related challenges. First, students expressed that GenAI did not\nprovide enough room for improvement, saying, \"AI's story was too perfect.\" This is an interesting finding\nin the educational context, where the purpose of using Al is to support student's cognitive development\nrather than to merely produce high-quality writing outcomes (Barrett & Pack, 2023). If the Al performs\nperfectly in the educational context and provides perfectly complete outcomes, students would be\ndeprived of learning opportunities they can earn by critically evaluating, editing, and improving the\ncontent. This implies an important insight into the considerate adjustment of performance levels of GenAI\nin education.\nSecond, it was found that the AI system lacks the necessary pedagogical skills, such as providing\nadaptive and formative feedback. In addition, students expressed that the stories and learning materials\nfailed to adapt to individual students' levels (\u201cIt was too easy for me. It will be different for everyone, but\nthere are not many options for us,\u201d S6). Students expected the AI system to be a content generator for\nmath stories and a pedagogical agent that could provide adaptive and personalized support throughout the\nlearning process. Teachers specifically emphasized the importance of the AI system's function in\nproviding adaptive and formative feedback to the students, as it could provide preliminary instant\nfeedback before teachers.\nThird, it was found that creative mathematical writing with GenAI deprived students of\nautonomous learning opportunities. While GenAI was introduced as a learning support for those students\nwho need a kick-start in writing, some students expressed that they wanted to do it by themselves as well.\nThis could be related to students' intrinsic motivation, which is stimulated when they have more"}, {"title": "V.

We utilize the latest advancements in Al technology to identify crucial factors that influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns and to improve their fundraising outcomes by strategically optimizing these factors. Our best-performing machine learning model accurately predicts the fundraising outcomes of 81.0% of campaigns, primarily based on their textual descriptions. Interpreting the machine learning model allows us to provide actionable suggestions on improving the textual description before launching a campaign. We demonstrate that by augmenting just three aspects of the narrative using a large language model, a campaign becomes more preferable to 83% human evaluators, and its likelihood of securing financial support increases by 11.9%. Our research uncovers the effective strategies for crafting descriptions for small business fundraising campaigns and opens up a new realm in integrating large language models into crowdfunding methodologies.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Small businesses provide a critical foundation for the US economy [1]. According to the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA), small businesses consist of 99.9% of American businesses, which together employed 61.7 million Americans as of 2023 [2]. Unlike larger corporations, small businesses are more financially vulnerable to policy changes and eco-nomic recessions, and they have access to fewer financial support resources [3, 4]. This challenge is particularly exaggerated during economic shocks, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the COVID-19 lockdown, and natural disaster occurrences. In these situations, small businesses are found more financially fragile and more likely to face permanent closure than large firms (e.g., 5\u20138). While governments strive to provide funding assistance, numer-ous small businesses encounter challenges in accessing these programs due to bureaucratic complexities and hurdles in proving their eligibility [7].\nSmall businesses are increasingly resorting to crowdfunding platforms to secure financial support. Projections estimate that the annual volume of such funding will reach $6.8 billion by 2031 [9]. Nevertheless, turning to crowdfunding presents its own set of challenges, as many practitioners have limited experience and knowledge in organizing successful crowdfunding campaigns. About 40% of these campaigns did not receive any funding [10]. To address this challenge, prior studies have investigated various campaign strategies to facilitate crowd fundraising, including the use of matching donations [11, 12] and offering thank-you gifts [13-15]. These mechanisms, however, typically tested one at a time, may face limited real-world applicability due to financial and logistical constraints. In contrast, business owners usually have more control and flexibility over the narratives of their campaigns, allowing them to incorporate practical linguistic enhancements into their crafted messages. This includes making their narratives more emotionally compelling [16] and socially oriented [17, 18], focusing more on the benefits to donors or recipients [19], and using less common words to convey their stories [20].\nHowever, in the absence of accurate methods for text comprehension, previous research on linguistic factors has been restricted to lexical and syntactic analysis. This limitation pre-vents a complete understanding of the extensive scope, depth, and complexities of linguistic expression within narratives. Such analyses typically fail to provide sufficient insights into the strategic presentation of fundraising campaigns, including critical aspects such as budget plans and business history. Consequently, these elements are often examined in a piecemeal fashion and/or experimented on a case-by-case basis.\nThe recent advancements in large language models have unveiled new opportunities, thanks to their compelling capabilities in text comprehension and generation. As shown in recent studies, the ChatGPT operated by OpenAI outperforms human crowdworkers in a number of text annotation tasks [21] and boosts worker productivity in certain writing tasks [22].\nDrawing on these findings and theoretical insights, we identify and quantify over a hun-dred aspects in the descriptions of small business fundraising campaigns with the help of large language models and lexical tools. By employing these identified cues as features, we utilize machine learning models to forecast the outcomes of these campaigns. Our most effec-tive model achieves an accuracy of 81.0% in predicting fundraising results. By evaluating the importance of various features, we have compiled a detailed list of factors that influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns. This analysis provides actionable guidance on how to introduce the business, explain the urgency of the request, and express appreciation effectively in the campaign introduction.\nOur study demonstrates that ChatGPT can be effectively instructed to revise campaign introductions by incorporating these insights. A simulation analysis suggests that a campaign could increase its likelihood of receiving financial support by an average of 11.9%, after integrating just three of these key factors. This benefit is significantly higher on originally unfunded campaigns. Our findings are further supported by an online experiment, where a revised campaign introduction is preferable by 83% human evaluators.\nOur research marks a pioneering step in the use of generative AI for crowdfunding. We've developed a pipeline that employs large language models to extract key factors from cam-paign narratives and to implement these factors. This approach is accessible and feasible for small businesses, even those without extensive knowledge of campaign organization or nat-ural language processing. Our findings offer practical solutions for optimizing fundraising campaigns, even for those lacking the resources to deploy an AI-augmented approach. They can significantly boost the success rate of their campaign by simply revising a few key aspects in its introduction before launch. Our research contributes to enhancing the overall success of small business crowdfunding campaigns as well as increasing the equity in this context."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "We collect 11,274 fundraising campaigns that fall into the small-business-relief collection on GoFundMe, the largest crowdfunding platform in the world [23]. These campaigns encom-pass 50 States in the U.S. and the period between January 22nd, 2020 and December 31st, 2020, which corresponds to the initial outbreak and lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most recent external shock that has broad impact on small businesses (SI.1.1). \n1 presents an overview of the geographical distribution of these campaigns and the ratio of funded campaigns per county. Our results indicate geographical disparities in crowdfunding success, with campaigns originating from regions of lower socio-economic status (in terms of education level and median household income) facing lower percentage of receiving funding.\nOn GoFundMe, fundraisers seek donations from the general public by posting a campaign that specifies the fundraising goal amount, relevant photo(s), and a short textual descrip-tion. We combine behavioral theories and computational tools to identify the key factors that contribute to fundraising success. These factors are derived from four sources: the textual description of the campaign, campaign configuration (such as the targeted fundraising goal amount), demographics in the business's local area (from the American Community Survey), and other contextual factors (such as the severity of the pandemic shock). The detailed feature extraction process is described in the Supplementary Information (SI.1.2).\nWe primarily focus on the factors derived from the text description, as these are easily adjustable by fundraisers before launching their campaign and the text description serves as the main channel through which potential donors gather crucial information about the business and the campaign [24]. Such information includes the nature of the small business's services, the mutual benefits for both the business and its donors [19], and the reasons why the small business is requesting the specified financial support. Drawing on insights from prior literature in crowdfunding, small business, and natural language processing (e.g., 16, 19, 20, 25-29), we employ both large language models (LLMs) and lexicon-based methods (LBMs) to extract factors from campaign descriptions. LLMs assist in capturing semantic and pragmatic factors such as social comparison with peer businesses, the plan for funding usage, and the urgency of fundraising. LBMs help in depicting the writing style and sentiment of the"}, {"title": "3 Results", "content": "3.1 Prediction Results\nOur best performing LightGBM model achieves 81% accuracy in predicting the fundraising outcomes of out-of-sample small business campaigns, marking an 36.59% improvement over a baseline uniform guess. More details are shown in Table S8."}, {"title": "3.2 Counterfactual Forecasting", "content": "We prompt ChatGPT-4 to revise existing campaign descriptions, aligning them with three optimal strategies we've identified above: (1) express gratitude to donors; (2) explain the urgency of funding needs; (3) acknowledge the availability of matching grants. These mod-ifications alter the language of a campaign while preserving its fundamental characteristics.\nThe alterations made to the campaign description are expected to modify its textual features. This, in turn, could potentially result in a counterfactual prediction by the LightGBM model, indicating how these changes might influence the campaign's likelihood of securing funding.\nOur results show that 92% campaigns are more likely to be funded with the GPT-revised description than with its original description. On average, as shown in Figure 3, the likelihood of fundraising success lifts from 33.2% before AI augmentation to 45.1% afterwards, marking a notable 11.9% average increase (and 12%, p < .01 after controlling for the length of the description a robustness check due to the extended text length with GPT augmentation as shown in Table S13).\nWhich campaigns benefit more from the ChatGPT augmentation? In other words, does revising the campaign description through ChatGPT diminish or amplify the disparity between campaigns that were originally funded and those that were not? As shown in Figure 3, campaigns that had failed to secure any fund with their original descriptions could benefit more from the revisions by ChatGPT-4 (the likelihood of fundraising increases from 25.1% to 41.1%) than those who had received fund with their original descriptions (the likelihood of fundraising has a smaller increase from 50.2% to 53.5%). This effect is particularly desir-able, as campaigns organized by female or in low socio-economic regions are less likely to be funded (Figures 1 and S1), and our result underscores the potential of using AI tools like"}, {"title": "3.3 Online Experiment", "content": "We complement the offline simulation analysis and validate the effectiveness of AI aug-mentation, with a randomized online experiment to test whether the GPT-revised campaign descriptions are more preferable to humans (pre-registered on AEA RCT Registry [35]).\nWe randomly selected 16 campaigns from the simulation analysis via stratified sam-pling (SI.4.2). To control for the length effect, we prompted ChatGPT-4 to paraphrase and extend the original description (without introducing additional information), referred to as GPT-extended, to match the length to the revised version that implements the three insights (referred to as GPT-augmented). For each campaign, we generated pairwise comparisons among these three conditions (original, GPT-augmented, and GPT-extended).\nWe recruited 263 participants from the Prolific survey platform [36].

However, optimizing the design and operation of crowdfunding campaigns imposes significant knowledge, experi-ence, and resource barriers on small businesses. Utilizing the advancements in large language models and generative AI, our research demonstrates that the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns can be substantially enhanced. This is achieved by applying a few generally imple-mentable, yet effective strategies to refine the narratives in the campaign descriptions before the campaign launch. Our results suggest that even minor adjustments in campaign narratives, facilitated by AI, can have a profound and equitable impact on fundraising outcomes, par-ticularly benefiting small businesses from low socioeconomic regions that might otherwise struggle to attract financial support.\nSpecifically, our findings indicate that simply including a mention of a matching grant in the campaign description can increase the probability of receiving donations by 5%. This insight is particularly crucial in light of the mixed results from previous studies, which have shown that while matching grants sometimes boost donation likelihood [11, 12, 38], there"}]}

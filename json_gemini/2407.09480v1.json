We utilize the latest advancements in AI technology to identify crucial factors that influence the success of crowdfunding campaigns and to improve their fundraising outcomes by strategically optimizing these factors. Our best-performing machine learning model accurately predicts the fundraising outcomes of 81.0% of campaigns, primarily based on their textual descriptions. Interpreting the machine learning model allows us to provide actionable suggestions on improving the textual description before launching a campaign. We demonstrate that by augmenting just three aspects of the narrative using a large language model, a campaign becomes more preferable to 83% human evaluators, and its likelihood of securing financial support increases by 11.9%. Our research uncovers the effective strategies for crafting descriptions for small business fundraising campaigns and opens up a new realm in integrating large language models into crowdfunding methodologies.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Small businesses provide a critical foundation for the US economy [1]. According to the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA), small businesses consist of 99.9% of American businesses, which together employed 61.7 million Americans as of 2023 [2]. Unlike larger corporations, small businesses are more financially vulnerable to policy changes and economic recessions, and they have access to fewer financial support resources [3, 4]. This challenge is particularly exaggerated during economic shocks, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the COVID-19 lockdown, and natural disaster occurrences. In these situations, small businesses are found more financially fragile and more likely to face permanent closure than large firms (e.g., 5\u20138). While governments strive to provide funding assistance, numerous small businesses encounter challenges in accessing these programs due to bureaucratic complexities and hurdles in proving their eligibility [7].\nSmall businesses are increasingly resorting to crowdfunding platforms to secure financial support. Projections estimate that the annual volume of such funding will reach $6.8 billion by 2031 [9]. Nevertheless, turning to crowdfunding presents its own set of challenges, as many practitioners have limited experience and knowledge in organizing successful crowdfunding campaigns. About 40% of these campaigns did not receive any funding [10]. To address this challenge, prior studies have investigated various campaign strategies to facilitate crowd fundraising, including the use of matching donations [11, 12] and offering thank-you gifts [13-15]. These mechanisms, however, typically tested one at a time, may face limited real-world applicability due to financial and logistical constraints. In contrast, business owners usually have more control and flexibility over the narratives of their campaigns, allowing them to incorporate practical linguistic enhancements into their crafted messages. This includes"}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "We collect 11,274 fundraising campaigns that fall into the small-business-relief collection on GoFundMe, the largest crowdfunding platform in the world [23]. These campaigns encompass 50 States in the U.S. and the period between January 22nd, 2020 and December 31st, 2020, which corresponds to the initial outbreak and lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most recent external shock that has broad impact on small businesses (SI.1.1).

More details are shown in Table S8."}, {"title": "3.1 Prediction Results", "content": "By interpreting the feature importance of the best-performing model, which quantifies the increase of information gain achieved by each feature, we are able to identify the most predictive features for the fundraising outcome. As shown in Figure 2 (a), we find that textual features extracted from the description collectively account for 80.33% of the improvement in predictive accuracy towards fundraising success, followed by the demographics of the local area (10.76%), campaign configuration (6.75%), and the severity of the pandemic shock to the local area (2.16%). The importance of the textual features is validated by an ablation study that compares the performance of the prediction model with or without the group of features (S9). The importance of individual features is more skewed. One single feature, a confirmation of the small business identity of the fundraising entity in the campaign description, alone contributes to 36% of the improvement in predictive accuracy.\nTo discern the specific relationships between individual textual features and the fundraising outcome, we examine the features with high importance in the best-performing Light-GBM model. We then train a Logistic Regression model to understand the contribution and influence of these features on the campaign success (SI.2). The main results are summarized in Figure 2(b) and details are reported in Table S10. Table S11 highlights the related literature and our findings regarding the textual features.\nThe result of logistic regression corroborates several findings from the existing literature. For example, longer descriptions are associated with a higher likelihood of donation to campaigns (p < .01). The finding is consistent with previous research on Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform where donors typically get a copy of product in exchange for their financial support [32]. In line with previous studies on the effects of personal pronouns [33],"}, {"title": "3.2 Counterfactual Forecasting", "content": "We prompt ChatGPT-4 to revise existing campaign descriptions, aligning them with three optimal strategies we've identified above: (1) express gratitude to donors; (2) explain the urgency of funding needs; (3) acknowledge the availability of matching grants. These modifications alter the language of a campaign while preserving its fundamental characteristics.\nThe alterations made to the campaign description are expected to modify its textual features. This, in turn, could potentially result in a counterfactual prediction by the LightGBM model, indicating how these changes might influence the campaign's likelihood of securing funding.\nOur results show that 92% campaigns are more likely to be funded with the GPT-revised description than with its original description. On average, as shown in Figure 3, the likelihood of fundraising success lifts from 33.2% before AI augmentation to 45.1% afterwards, marking a notable 11.9% average increase (and 12%, p < .01 after controlling for the length of the description a robustness check due to the extended text length with GPT augmentation as shown in Table S13).\nWhich campaigns benefit more from the ChatGPT augmentation? In other words, does revising the campaign description through ChatGPT diminish or amplify the disparity between campaigns that were originally funded and those that were not? As shown in Figure 3, campaigns that had failed to secure any fund with their original descriptions could benefit more from the revisions by ChatGPT-4 (the likelihood of fundraising increases from 25.1% to 41.1%) than those who had received fund with their original descriptions (the likelihood of fundraising has a smaller increase from 50.2% to 53.5%). This effect is particularly desirable, as campaigns organized by female or in low socio-economic regions are less likely to be funded (Figures 1 and S1), and our result underscores the potential of using AI tools like"}, {"title": "3.3 Online Experiment", "content": "We complement the offline simulation analysis and validate the effectiveness of AI augmentation, with a randomized online experiment to test whether the GPT-revised campaign descriptions are more preferable to humans (pre-registered on AEA RCT Registry [35]).\nWe randomly selected 16 campaigns from the simulation analysis via stratified sampling (SI.4.2). To control for the length effect, we prompted ChatGPT-4 to paraphrase and extend the original description (without introducing additional information), referred to as GPT-extended, to match the length to the revised version that implements the three insights (referred to as GPT-augmented). For each campaign, we generated pairwise comparisons among these three conditions (original, GPT-augmented, and GPT-extended)."}, {"title": "4 Discussion", "content": "Unlocking the crowdfunding success for small businesses is of unprecedented importance, particularly in light of the escalating federal debt and the financial constraints faced by many states, which hinder them to meet all their fiscal obligations [37]. However, optimizing the design and operation of crowdfunding campaigns imposes significant knowledge, experience, and resource barriers on small businesses. Utilizing the advancements in large language models and generative AI, our research demonstrates that the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns can be substantially enhanced. This is achieved by applying a few generally implementable, yet effective strategies to refine the narratives in the campaign descriptions before the campaign launch. Our results suggest that even minor adjustments in campaign narratives, facilitated by AI, can have a profound and equitable impact on fundraising outcomes, particularly benefiting small businesses from low socioeconomic regions that might otherwise struggle to attract financial support.\nSpecifically, our findings indicate that simply including a mention of a matching grant in the campaign description can increase the probability of receiving donations by 5%. This insight is particularly crucial in light of the mixed results from previous studies, which have shown that while matching grants sometimes boost donation likelihood [11, 12, 38], there"}]}

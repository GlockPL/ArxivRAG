INTRODUCTION", "content": "PHYTOPLANKTON is a general term for plant microorganisms, particularly referring to microalgae (see Fig. 1) [1]. Phytoplankton is a vital component of aquatic ecosystems, with their activities serving as key indicators for marine ecological processes and environmental conditions [2]. Consequently, monitoring phytoplankton holds significant importance in maintaining the stability of aquatic ecosystems, safeguarding water resources, and advancing scientific exploration [3].\nTraditional efforts on monitoring phytoplankton mainly rely on the so-called non-in situ observation approach, that is to collect water samples and bring them back to the laboratory with manual observation [4]. This approach not only consumes considerable time and human resources but also fails to analyze phytoplankton timely. To overcome this limitation, we develop an intelligent tracking framework, called PyTracker, that can be deployed on the ocean to monitor phytoplankton in a way of in situ observations. This framework is designed to automatically localize and categorize phytoplankton and then track them constantly observed in the microscope. The results can provide versatile information in monitoring phytoplankton, and can be utilized for further analysis such as density estimation, action recognition, pose estimation, etc."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUNDS AND RELATED WORKS", "content": "Phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are plant-like life forms (see Fig.1) that play an indispensable role in marine ecosystems. Through photosynthesis, they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, providing a crucial source of oxygen for marine life, while also fixing carbon in organic matter [10]. When they die, some of the organic carbon settles to the ocean floor, forming sediments and participating in long-term carbon storage and the Earth's carbon cycle [11]. Phytoplankton are also the foundation of the marine food chain. They are consumed by zooplankton and other organisms, thereby supporting the entire marine ecosystem [12]. Additionally, phytoplankton play a role in regulating the global climate by modulating the reflectivity of the ocean surface, and by absorbing and releasing heat. They also impact the chemical composition of the atmosphere, thus affecting atmospheric circulation and climate.\nMonitoring Phytoplankton. Observing and real-time monitoring of phytoplankton species, density, and concentration have significant implications for humans and nature [13]\u2013[15]. Firstly, changes in phytoplankton species and density can reflect the ecological health of water bodies. By monitoring phytoplankton, we can promptly detect abnormal changes in ecosystems and take appropriate measures [16]. Secondly, phytoplankton are very sensitive to environmental factors such as light, temperature, and carbon dioxide. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can provide valuable data on climate change [17] Moreover, phytoplankton form the base of the marine food chain. Their density and distribution directly affect the reproduction and survival of other marine organisms. By monitoring phytoplankton, fishery managers can predict the density and distribution of fish resources, thereby formulating more effective fishery management strategies [13]. Additionally, certain species of phytoplankton can proliferate under specific conditions, forming harmful algal blooms (such as red tides), which lead to oxygen depletion in water bodies, release toxins, and pose threats to aquatic life and human health. Real-time monitoring of phytoplankton can provide early warnings of harmful algal blooms, reducing their negative impacts [18].\nTraditional monitoring methods, referred to as non-in-situ observation, involve the collection of water samples and their observation under microscopes by trained personnel [4], [19], [20]. However, these techniques require a lot of time and human resources and lack the ability for timely phytoplankton analysis. Recently, advancements in hardware have made in-situ observation feasible by integrating digital microscopes, flow pumps, and computational chips into a single device [21]. While this device shows promising potential for phytoplankton monitoring, the algorithms specifically dedicated to this task remains unexplored. Typically, tracking is the prerequisite task for monitoring phytoplankton. Given the tracking results, we can futher analyze the activities of phytoplankton. However, existing tracking algorithms are designed for ground scenario. Compared to the ground scenario, tracking phytoplankton poses unique challenges due to the different monitor pipelines, the inconspicuous appearance of phytoplankton, and the complexity of monitoring scenario. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a devoted tracking framework for phytoplankton.\nObject Tracking. The existing tracking methods are mainly designed for ground scenarios, focusing on tracking general objects such as vehicles and pedestrians [22]\u2013[26]. To obtain the trajectory of objects, Object extraction, temporal association and motion prediction are three important aspects in multi-object tracking within video sequences. According to the tracking pipeline, existing methods can be divided into two categories: Offline tracking and Online tracking.\nOffline Tracking. Offline tracking allows the use of information from subsequent frames and is formulated as a graph model for a globally optimal solution [27]\u2013[29]. However, this setup makes it not suitable for practical applications due to its reliance on future frame data.\nOnline Tracking. Online multi-object tracking involves"}, {"title": "III. MOTIVATION AND PRELIMINARY VALIDATION", "content": "The straightforward solution for tracking phytoplankton is to directly adapt existing tracking methods into this task. However, these methods are designed for ground scenarios and focus on tackling common challenges such as occlusions, target matching between frames, and camera jitters. Thus they do not align with the scenario of phytoplankton in aquatic environments. Unlike conventional tracking targets such as pedestrian and vehicles, phytoplankton exhibits significant differences in data characteristics, including their unique low-contrast color features, the stark contrast between aquatic and ground environments, and their distinct movement patterns compared to other organisms. These differences significantly hinder the application of existing methods to phytoplankton monitoring. To validate this, we adopt the recent tracking methods ByteTrack [34] to our task. As shown in Fig. 3, it can be seen that the generated attention heatmaps of ByteTrack can hardly concentrate on the phytoplankton, indicating the infeasibility of directly adopting existing tracking methods."}, {"title": "IV. METHOD", "content": "This paper describes an online tracker, PhyTracker, devoted to monitoring phytoplankton. Compared to existing tracking methods, our method features three major improvements. First, we introduce a Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction (TFE) module to enhance the appearance distinction of phytoplankton. This improvement enables the phytoplankton becoming more detectable. Second, we propose an Attention-enhanced Temporal Association (ATA) module, which optimizes the feature distances between targets in adjacent frames, enhancing the capacity of model to distinguish between similar phytoplankton, as well as impurities and phytoplankton. Furthermore, we introduce a Flow-agnostic Movement Refinement (FMR) module, which effectively reduces feature confusion from similar motion trajectories between different tracking entities and preserves original movement offset information, thereby enhancing sensitivity to individual movement characteristics. These three improvements correspond to solving the three difficulties in phytoplankton monitoring, as described in Sec.1.\nA. Problem Setup\nDenote a video sequence with total N frames as V =\n$\\displaystyle \\{I_{t}\\}_{t=1}^{N}$, where $I_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times w \\times 3}$ refers to the t-th frame. Suppose this video sequence contains D phytoplankton. The goal of"}, {"title": "C. Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction", "content": "Phytoplankton often exhibit appearance similar to their natural aquatic environments, making it difficult for traditional methods to capture discriminative features. In light of this, we propose a Texture-enhanced Feature Extraction (TFE) module to enhance feature extraction of phytoplankton (see Fig. 4). Inspired by [36], [37], this module extracts the noise information combined with semantic information to enrich the representation of phytoplankton features. Specifically, to amplify the subtle textures, we employ dilated convolutions [38] to expand the receptive field without increasing computational load. Then several SIE blocks are proposed to refine the features. SIE block is composed of convolution layers and SRM layers.\nSRM filters were originally designed to address the issues of image denoising and edge preservation in image processing. Under the microscope, there are situations where the flow image is unclear and there are many impurities. In response to this, we have modified the SRM filter to match the effectiveness of extracting additional information from phytoplankton data."}, {"title": "D. Attention-enhanced Temporal Association", "content": "Effectively associating the features of phytoplankton across frames is crucial for accurate tracking results. However, temporal association in our task is challenging, due to the widespread impurities in observing scenario and similar-appearance phytoplankton of different types.\nTo address this issue, we propose an Attention-enhanced Temporal Association (ATA) module, which is designed to effectively find the feature association of same target across consecutive frames. The core of this module is a newly proposed Two-Stage Cross-Attention (TSCA) operations based on existing self-attention mechanism [40], [41]. As shown in Fig. 5, the first stage is a feature refinement block, which enhances the features of current frame $f_{t}$ and previous frame $f_{t-1}$. Then the enhanced features are executed a cross-attention operation to model the temporal associations.\nSpecifically, in the first stage, the feature $f_{t-1}$ is sent into the CP and CB modules, and then added with $f_{t-1}$ for refinement. Different from $f_{t-1}$, the feature $f_{t}$ is separately processed by Conv and CP modules, and calculates attention by matrix multiplication. The multiplication result is then sent into CB block, and perform residual connection with $f_{t}$ for refinement. In the second stage, the refined features are performed similar operations. But the difference is that we performance cross-attention operations to obtain the intermediate feature $w_{t}$. Let Qrepresent query features obtained from $f_{t-1}$, and K,V represent key and value features obtained from $f_{t}$. Inspired by [41], the cross-attention operation can be defined as\n$\\displaystyle \\text{CA}(Q, K, V) = \\phi_{q}(Q)(\\phi_{k}(K)^{T}V),$ (2)\nwhere $\\phi_{q}$ and $\\phi_{k}$ are the normalization functions for query and key features, implementing by normalization methods:\n$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} \\phi_{q}(Q) &= \\text{softmax}_{\\text{row}}(Q) \\\\ \\phi_{k}(K) &= \\text{softmax}_{\\text{col}}(K), \\end{aligned}$ (3)\nnote that $\\text{softmax}_{\\text{row}}$, $\\text{softmax}_{\\text{col}}$ denotes the application of the softmax function along each row or column of the corresponding input.\nIt is important to note that the feature $w_{t}$ represents a feature that enhances the association of the same tracking target in the current frame feature $f_{t}$ and the past frame feature $f_{t-1}$."}, {"title": "E. Flow-agnostic Movement Refinement", "content": "The motion characteristics of phytoplankton under this scenario are mainly driven by water currents, exhibiting"}, {"title": "V. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "A. Experimental Settings\nDatasets. Our method is validated on two public datasets, PMOT [8] and MOT [9].\n1) The PMOT dataset is a synthetic dataset specifically designed for phytoplankton tracking tasks, encompassing a total of 21 categories. It simulates video footage of plankton observed in flowing pipes under a microscope, making it the first synthetic dataset of its kind. Tracking phytoplankton in real-world environments involves much more complex scenes compared to laboratory settings. Therefore, we expanded our dataset to simulate the presence of noise found in real-world scenarios. The phytoplankton dataset we use is derived from modifications to the PMOT2023 dataset. We integrated data collected over the years from our laboratory, selecting the most suitable portions for inclusion. Based on this, we applied transformations such as occlusions, gray processing, blurring and salt-and-pepper noise to simulate complex underwater environmental conditions. Depending on the degree of added noise, we classified the entire phytoplankton dataset into three difficulty levels: no noise for easy difficulty; a lower degree of noise for medium difficulty; and a higher degree of noise for hard difficulty. As shown in Fig. 9. This allowed us to validate the model's generalization capabilities under more realistic conditions. The entire dataset consists of 9 original video segments and 63 noise-added video segments, with the length of the transformed videos matching that of the original videos. The composition of the dataset is shown in Table I. The ablation studies were evaluated using the phytoplankton dataset.\n2) To fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on the MOT dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field of multi-object tracking. The MOT dataset is designed to present a range of complex scenarios, including busy streets, shopping malls, parks, and other environments, and is provided by the MOT Challenge organization. The MOT17 dataset includes annotations for the training set but does not provide annotations for the test set; performance metrics can only be obtained by uploading the tracking results to the MOTChallenge website for evaluation. In our experiments with the MOT17 dataset, we performed an overall algorithm evaluation using only the training set. Specifically, we divided the training set into two halves: one half was used for training, and the other half was used for testing.\nEvaluation Metrics. Following previous methods [35], we employ CLEAR-MOT metrics [44] to evaluate the tracking performance. This metric consists of various indicators, including MOTA, IDF1, IDs, FP, FN. The explanation of each indicator is introduced as follows:\nMOTA is a comprehensive evaluation metric used to measure the overall performance of a tracker across the entire dataset;\nIDF1 measures a tracker's ability to maintain correct identity labels throughout an entire sequence;\nFalse Positives (FP) refer to instances where the tracking algorithm erroneously detects the presence of a target that does not exist in reality;\nFalse Negatives (FN) refer to instances where the tracking algorithm fails to detect a target that is actually present;\nIdentity switches (IDs) occur when the tracking algorithm mistakenly changes the identifier of a target during the tracking process.\nAmong these indicators, MOTA and IDF1 stand out as the most important for evaluating tracking performance."}, {"title": "C.

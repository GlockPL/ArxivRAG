Putting it more scientifically, aesthetics is the science of critical\njudgement of the beautiful (Nake, 1974). Therefore, aesthetics is also the science of critical\njudgement of the ugly as the opposite of the beautiful (Stangneth, 2019). In these latter senses,\naesthetics is part of aesthesiology as the science of perception in general, and of the reception\nof art in particular (Consoli, 2020; Tedesco, 2024), thus overlapping with psychology and the\nhuman cognitive neurosciences (Fechner, 1876; Frascaroli et al, 2024; Pearce et al, 2016).\nFor the judgment of an object or event as being beautiful, abstract features, such as regularity,\nsymmetry or orderliness are often invoked (Weyl, 1980). Formal principles such as the golden\nratio as one specific trait appear in all kinds of natural and artistic beauty, ranging from\nflowers to galaxies in nature and from ancient cultures to contemporary architecture, painting,\nsculpture, music, dance and drama (Atlas, 2003; Livio, 2002; Power and Shannon, 2019).\nAlso the pioneers of experimental psychology and psychophysics, Gustav Theodor Fech-\nner (1801 \u2013 1887) and Wilhelm Wundt (1832 \u2013 1920) were acutely interested in aesthetic\njudgements. Fechner, e.g., in his Vorschule der \u00c4sthetik (literally: Primary School on Aes-\nthetics), had conducted the probably very first experiments on empirical aesthetics: Subjects\nwere asked to select the most \"beautiful\u201d and the \"ugliest\" quadrangle from a selection of ten\nsimultaneously presented ones with equal areas but with different aspect ratios, ranging from\nsquares (1: 1) to rectangles with 2: 5, also including the golden ratio (\u03c6 \u2248 21 : 34 \u2248 0.6176)\n(Fechner, 1876, pp. 190). His results indicated that the rectangle with the golden ratio was\nexperienced as the most beautiful stimulus (Fechner, 1876, pp. 195), although he conceded\nthat the aesthetic value of the golden ratio could have been somewhat overestimated (Fech-\nner, 1876, pp. 192). Yet, later attempts to replicate Fechner's results have revealed some\nmethodological flaws in his studies (Livio, 2002, Ch. 7).\nPlotting the results of Fechner (1876, p. 195) graphically, entails a kind of bell-shaped,\nor \"inverse U-shaped\" response curve that already appeared in Wundt's Grundz\u00fcge der\nPhysiologischen Psychologie (Principles of Physiological Psychology) as emotional strength\ndepending on stimulus intensity (Wundt, 1874, pp. 432). This characteristic curve (Wundt\n(1874, Fig. 97); also compare with Fig. 1 below for illustration) was dubbed the \"Wundt\ncurve\" of hedonic value by Berlyne (1970), where\n[...] the abscissa is taken to represent \"arousal potential,\" a term meant to cover all the stimulus\nproperties that tend to raise arousal, including novelty and complexity. Positive hedonic value reaches\na maximum with moderate arousal potential (stimulation producing a moderate arousal increment)\nand then, as arousal potential increases further, hedonic value takes on lower and lower positive values\nand finally becomes negative. (Berlyne, 1970, p. 284)\nHere, maximal \u201chedonic value\" corresponds with the aesthetic appreciation of the beautiful.\nThe Wundt curve of aesthetic appraisal has been confirmed more or less in numerous\nstudies on empirical aesthetics. To mention only a few of them: McMullen and Arnold (1976)\npresented pairs of rhythmic musical sequences to their subjects. These were asked to choose\nthe most preferred or most interesting sequences. As one result they reported that the be-\nginning of a response curve displays an inverted U-shape in dependence on redundancy in\nrhythmic sequences. In a more recent study, Marin and Leder (2013) proposed a cross-domain\napproach, acknowledging the multidimensional nature of complexity. In four experiments,\nthey employed pictures of affective scenes, representational paintings, and music excerpts.\nStimuli were pre-selected to vary in emotional content and complexity. Ratings of familiar-\nity, complexity, pleasantness and arousal were obtained for each set of stimuli. Subsequent\nstatistical analyses revealed positive correlations between subjective complexity and arousal.\nLater, G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fct\u00fcrk et al (2016) collected ratings of liking and perceived complexity for digitally\ngenerated images. Additionally, they also calculated complexity measures for each image.\nAs a result, they reported an inverted U-curve relationship between aesthetic appreciation\nand stimulus complexity. In a large corpus study, Sigaki et al (2018) and Perc (2020) con-\nducted quantitative analyses of almost 140,000 paintings, covering nearly a millennium of art\nhistory. Based on the local spatial patterns in the images, they estimated entropy and com-\nplexity measures of each painting. These measures represented the amount of visual order\nof artworks, locally reflecting qualitative categories proposed by art historians. Interestingly,\nthe dependence of statistical complexity on entropy exhibited another inverted U-curve rela-\ntionship. Finally, Agres et al (2017) investigated the connection between harmonic musical\nstructure and aesthetic appraisal. In a psychological rating experiment listeners assessed their\nenjoyment for computer-generated anthems with varying levels of harmonic repetition and\ncomplexity. These ratings were further explored using computational approaches, based on\ninformation theory and on musicological tonal tension measures (You et al, 2023). Their re-\nsults also provided evidence for a Wundt-type relationship between complexity and aesthetic\nenjoyment.\nClearly, judgements of the beautiful and the reception of art works are complex neuro-\ndynamical and mental processes that require multivariate and multidimensional methodology\n(Consoli, 2020), which was substantially recognized in the experiments by Cheung et al\n(2019, 2024) on the appreciation of musical beauty. Specifically, Cheung et al (2019) demon-\nstrated that pleasure varies nonlinearly as a function of two independent variables: context\nuncertainty and stimulus surprisal. Taking Western tonal harmony as a model of musical struc-\nture, they trained machine-learning models to mathematically quantify the uncertainty and\nsurprise of about 80,000 chords in pop songs. They reported that cadential chords were ex-\nperienced as most pleasurable in two distinguished cases: On the one hand for contexts with\nlow uncertainty but highly surprising closure. On the other hand for highly uncertain con-\ntexts, but less surprising closure. In an additional neuroimaging study, Cheung et al (2019)\nreported that activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, and auditory cortex reflected the ob-\nserved interaction, while the nucleus accumbens only accounts for uncertainty. It is the aim\nof the present study, to discuss those results, partly reproduced in Fig. 2(a) below, in the light\nof a phenomenological model of aesthetic reception.\nAs already mentioned, many of the studies reviewed above, employed methods from\ninformation theory (Moles, 1966; Nake, 1974, 2012; Shannon and Weaver, 1949; V\u00f6lz,\n1988), complexity science (Badii and Politi, 1997; Gernert, 2006), and machine learning\n(Pearce, 2018; Russell and Norvig, 2010; Schmidhuber, 2010) which are also suitable for a\ndeeper theoretical understanding and philosophical reflection of aesthetic judgements. An\nearly account was given by Immanuel Kant (1724 \u2013 1804) in his Kritik der Urteilskraft\n(Critique of the Power of Judgement), where he wrote:\n[...] the judgement of taste must rest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of the Imagination\nin its freedom and the Understanding with its conformity to law. It must therefore rest on a feeling,\nwhich makes us judge the object by the purposiveness of the representation (by which an object is\ngiven) in respect of the furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its free play. (Kant, 1790/1914, p. 161,\n\u00a735)\nFor Kant, a \"judgement of taste\" (i.e., an aesthetic judgement) involves two mental faculties:\n\"Understanding\" as the \"faculty of rules\" (Kant, 1787/1999, B171) and \u201cImagination\" as the"}, {"title": "2 Pragmatic Information", "content": "In his own contribution to the foundation of information theory, Weaver described three\nlevels of the communication problem \"by which one mind may affect another\" (Shannon\nand Weaver, 1949, p. 3), namely\n\u2022 Level A. How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted? (The\ntechnical problem.)\n\u2022 Level B. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning? (The\nsemantic problem.)\n\u2022 Level C. How effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?\n(The effectiveness problem.) (Shannon and Weaver, 1949, p. 4).\nThese levels correspond roughly with the dimensions of semiotics (Morris, 1938). The \"tech-\nnical problem\" with noisy communication channels can be addressed by redundant codes,\nintroducing correlations between the symbols of the messages, i.e., by syntax. The \"se-\nmantic problem\" refers to correlations between the transmitted symbols and their intended\nmeanings (semantics). Finally, the \"effectiveness problem\" relates to pragmatics, namely the\ncorrelations between the symbols and their impact upon the message users.\nShannon's information measure H which is formally related to Boltzmann's entropy in\nstatistical physics and thermodynamics only accounts for the \"technical problem\" of efficient\ncommunication (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). A tentative measure of semantic information,\nor informativity I, was proposed by Bar-Hillel and Carnap (1953). Finally, von Weizs\u00e4cker\nand von Weizs\u00e4cker (1972) suggested three desiderata to be fulfilled by any reasonable\nmeasure of pragmatic information S:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n(i) Pragmatic information S assesses the impact of a message upon the mental states of a\ncognitive agent.\n(ii) Pragmatic information S should vanish in the limits of novelty (originality) N and\nconfirmation (banality) C.\n(iii) Novelty and confirmation presumably require a non-classical but rather quantum-like\ndescription in terms of incompatible mental operators.\nObviously, condition (ii) could be easily satisfied by defining pragmatic information as a\nproduct of suitable measures for novelty and confirmation: S = N \u00d7 C, such that S = 0 for\neither N = 0 or C = 0. This idea was originally suggested by Kornwachs and von Lucadou\n(1982).\nIn Shannon's information theory (Shannon and Weaver, 1949), a discrete information\nsource is given by an n-dimensional probability space (X, p) endowed with a probability\ndistribution p \u2208 [0,1]^n, such that 0 \u2264 pi < 1 is the probability of the atomic event Ei \u2208 X.\nThe discrete set X is considered as a repertoire with pi being the probability that the event\nEi was selected (Nake, 1974, 2012).\nThe information content, or informativity (Bar-Hillel and Carnap, 1953), of an event Ei is\ndefined as\n$I(p_i) = - ld p_i\u00b7$\nThe base of the logarithm is usually chosen as two, such that ld = log2 yields information\nmeasured in \u201cbits\". Equation (1) indicates that the smaller the probability pi, the larger the\ninformativity I(pi), which is therefore a measure of the surprise of the event Ei (Agres et al,\n2018; Hale, 2016). Clearly, informativity I can also be regarded as a measure of novelty or\noriginality N (von Weizs\u00e4cker and von Weizs\u00e4cker, 1972).\nThe averaged information over the entire distribution entails the Shannon entropy\n$H(p) = \\sum_i p_iI(p_i) = - \\sum_i p_ild p_i,$\nwhere the natural convention pild pi = 0 if pi = 0 applies (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). Note\nthat the contribution of a single event Ei \u2208 X to the entropy of the probability space,\n$S(p_i) = p_iI(p_i) = -p_ildp_i = N(p_i) \\times C(p_i),$\ncould be regarded as a measure of pragmatic information of Ei in the sense of Kornwachs\nand von Lucadou (1982), for N(pi) = I(pi) assesses novelty, while C(pi) = pi obviously\nreflects confirmation. This quantity has been introduced as the conspicuity (Auff\u00e4lligkeit) of\nthe event Ei in the framework of information-theoretic aesthetics (Nake, 1974, 2012; V\u00f6lz,\n1988). Further notice that the function (3) assumes its local maximum at site p = 1/e \u2248\n0.3679 which is surprisingly close to the complement of the golden ratio 1 \u03c6 \u2248 0.3824\n(Nake, 1974; V\u00f6lz, 1988).\nIn order to fulfill the three desiderata of von Weizs\u00e4cker and von Weizs\u00e4cker (1972)\nabove, an appropriate framework for music reception had already been proposed by Meyer\n(1956), that can be straightforwardly applied to aesthetic appreciation in general:\nWe have stated that styles in music are basically complex systems of probability relationships [...]\n(Meyer, 1956, p. 54)\nThe listener brings to music not only specifically musical experiences, associations, and disposi-\ntions but also important beliefs as to the nature and significance of aesthetic experience in general\nand the expected musical experience in particular. (Meyer, 1956, p. 73)\nRevision of opinion, stressed earlier in the discussion of probability, is also important in the percep-\ntion of form. Here, too, the listener often finds it necessary to revise his opinions of the significance\nof what has passed and his expectations of what is still to come in the light of an unexpected present.\n(Meyer, 1956, p. 60)\nBut even more important than designative meaning is what we have called embodied meaning.\nFrom this point of view what a musical stimulus or a series of stimuli indicate and point to are not\nextramusical concepts and objects but other musical events which are about to happen. That is, one\nmusical event (be it a tone, a phrase, or a whole section) has meaning because it points to and makes\nus expect another musical event. (Meyer, 1956, p. 35)\nThis small selection of quotes motivates the following definitions.\nLet A be a cognitive agent, here regarded as an aesthetic appreciator (Nake, 1974) with\nmental belief space (X,p). Thus, a mental state of A is a probability distribution p over\na repertoire X, or briefly, a belief state over X in the sense of either partially observable\ndecision models in artificial intelligence research (Russell and Norvig, 2010), or in the sense\nof Bayesian dynamic update semantics (van Benthem et al, 2009; G\u00e4rdenfors, 1988; beim\nGraben, 2006, 2014).\nNext, consider a natural or artistic object or event A, such as a phrase or a verse of a poem,\na view upon a building, a perspective toward a sculpture, a scene in a drama, or a motive\nor a phrase in music. When A can be represented as a mental operator A acting on (X,p)\nby means of a suitable functor \u0424 : A \u2192 A, a mapping from an a priori belief state q (i.e., a\ndistribution over the repertoire X) to an a posteriori belief state p (i.e., another or the same"}, {"title": "3 Modeling Aesthetic Appraisal", "content": "As already mentioned in the Introduction, the present study aims at a particular application\nof the phenomenological model for aesthetic pragmatic information, outlined in the previ-\nous section, to the experimental findings of Cheung et al (2019). In their first experiment, 39\nhealthy adults had to listen to 1,039 chords in 30 chord progressions that were selected from\n745 pop songs listed in the US Billboard \"\"Hot 100\u201d chart between 1958 and 1991, after\nremoving melody and rhythm and after transposition to C major mode. Subjects were in-\nstructed to continuously rate the pleasantness of each chord using a mechanical slider during\nstimulus exposure. To obtain the independent variables, an unsupervised statistical-learning\nmodel (Pearce, 2018) was trained to assess the statistical regularities of over 80,000 chord\nprogressions from the same music corpus. For each chord presented in the rating experiment,\nits uncertainty H was estimated as conditional Shannon entropy of the model. Similarly, the\nsurprise I was determined for every chord through the model. Figure Fig. 2(a) shows the re-\nsults of Cheung et al (2019). It displays standardized pleasure ratings P(I||H), namely the\naesthetic appreciation of music, in dependence of two variables: context uncertainty, H(q),\nand stimulus surprise, I(p).\nIn order to develop a mathematical model for the data plotted in Fig. 2(a), one has to as-\ncertain functional relationships between the experimental variables of Cheung et al (2019).\nFor the sake of simplicity, one considers a binary repertoire X = {E,F} without any sta-\ntistical correlations between successive events. Then, the prior q = (q,1 \u2013 q) as well as the\nposterior p = (p,1 \u2013 p) are parameterized by only one real number each: q \u2208 [0, 1] for the a\npriori distribution, and p \u2208 [0,1] for the dynamically updated a posteriori distribution, with\np = Aq under the aesthetic operator A.\nUnder those assumptions, the Shannon entropy (2) of the prior,\n$H(q) = -qldq \u2013 (1 \u2013 q) ld (1 \u2013 q),$\nwhich is known as Fermi-Dirac entropy in this particular form in statistical physics as it\nis maximized by the Fermi-Dirac distribution in the respective variational calculus (Kapur,\n1970; Borwein et al, 2011), becomes a suitable measure of context uncertainty for the study\nof Cheung et al (2019). Figure 1 displays the Fermi-Dirac entropy as a blue curve.\nBy contrast, the informativity (1)\n$I(p) = -ld p$\nmay be appropriately attributed to the surprise of the aesthetically closing stimulus A in the\nexperiment of Cheung et al (2019). Finally, the Kullback-Leibler divergence (7), interpreted\nas pragmatic information (8),\n$S(pq) = pld + (1-p)ld$\nshould be correlated with aesthetic enjoyment P(I||H) (Cheung et al, 2019) for all possible\ncombinations of p, q \u2208 [0, 1].\nTo further proceed, one has to substitute all occurrences of p,q in (11) by H(q) and\nI(p), inverting the functions (9) and (10), respectively. For the latter, this is straightforwardly\nachieved through\n$p = 2^{-I(p)}.$\nHowever, the Fermi-Dirac entropy (9) can be firstly approximated by the logistic map\n$L(q) = 4q(1-q)$\nplotted as the red curve in Fig. 1 above. The logistic map is well-known from dynamical\nsystem theory (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). Its inverse function is easily obtained through\ntwo branches\n$q_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\sqrt{1-L(q)})$"}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "The results of the phenomenological account for pragmatic information of aesthetic appraisal\nare shown in Fig. 2. Here, Fig. 2(a), reproduced from Cheung et al (2019) with permission of\nElsevier, depicts the standardized aesthetic pleasure measure P(I||H) gathered in the musical\nrating experiment of Cheung et al (2019) on the one hand. The color coding reflects the\nemotional intensity of the subjects' pleasure rating, ranging from P(I||H) = -4 (dark blue)\nto P(I||H) = +4 (dark red). The independent variables are context uncertainty H(q) of the a\npriori belief state q plotted along the abscissa, and stimulus surprise (ordinate), measured as\ninformativity I(p) of the a posteriori belief state p under aesthetic dynamic updating, p = Aq,\nfor a cadential chord A.\nOn the other hand, Fig. 2(b) presents the Kullback-Leibler divergence (15) computed\nfor the upper branch q+ of the Fermi-Dirac entropy H(q) (9) plotted as a model of context\nuncertainty along the abscissa. The ordinate depicts the informativity I(p) of the a posteriori\nbelief state p modeled through (10). Again, large positive values are indicated by bright red,\nwhile very small values are represented by dark blue, here. Because of the divergence of\nS(I(p)||H(q)) for H \u2192 0, only an interval [\u025b,1] is shown for the abscissa with small cut-off\n\u025b = 0.05.

This finding\nconfirms the second desideratum of von Weizs\u00e4cker and von Weizs\u00e4cker (1972). However,\nboth quantities differ in the respect, that the experimental data exhibit a saddle in parameter\nspace which is not present for pragmatic information, due to its non-negativity constraint.\nFor the sake of completeness, Fig. 3 shows additionally the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n(15) computed for the lower branch q\u2013 of the Fermi-Dirac entropy (9).\nInterestingly, this picture cannot consistently be interpreted as pragmatic information be-\ncause of the prevailing divergence of S(I(p)||H(q)) for H \u2192 0 that is even present for the\ninterval cut-off & = 0.05 used in Fig. 2(b). This behavior indicates that Kullback-Leibler di-\nvergence for the lower Fermi-Dirac branch is large for boring stimuli appearing in banal\ncontexts, thus violating the second desideratum of von Weizs\u00e4cker and von Weizs\u00e4cker (1972)\nfor pragmatic information. It is therefore also not a viable correlate of aesthetic appreciation."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "In their original proposal toward a theory of pragmatic information, von Weizs\u00e4cker and\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker (1972) formulated three desiderata that could be naturally fulfilled in the\nframework of dynamic update semantics (beim Graben, 2006). First, pragmatic informa-\ntion ascertains the impact of a message or event upon the mental state space of a cognitive\nagent. In dynamic semantics and machine learning, mental states of a cognitive agent are\nusually modeled as belief states, namely probability distributions over cognitive repertoires\nthat become updated by novel evidence provided by the reception of messages or events\n(van Benthem et al, 2009; G\u00e4rdenfors, 1988; beim Graben, 2006, 2014; Russell and Norvig,\n2010). Second, pragmatic information vanishes in the limits of novelty and confirmation.\nIn dynamic semantics a message or event exhibits novelty if it cannot be understood or\neven processed by a cognitive agent, whereas confirmation can be expressed by means of\nlogical consequence. Computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence for both special kinds of\ndynamic updating entails naught. Thus, beim Graben (2006) suggested this quantity as a suit-\nable measure of pragmatic information. Third, pragmatic information requires a quantum-like\ntreatment of incompatible operators. In dynamic semantics, belief revision, default reasoning,\nand anaphora present paradigmatic examples of non-commutative and hence incompatible up-\ndating processes (beim Graben, 2006, 2014). Moreover, a description of belief states in terms\nof Hilbert space vectors leads straightforwardly to a quantum-like formalism (Huber-Liebl\net al, 2022). Related approaches of pragmatic information have been used by Atmanspacher\nand Scheingraber (1990); Gernert (2006) and, more recently, by Davis et al (2024).\nThe present study has demonstrated that the framework of pragmatic information in\ndynamic semantics can be immediately applied to aesthetics as the science of beauty (Baum-\ngarten, 1750). Under the assumption that aesthetic objects or events act as quantum-like\noperators upon the belief states of a cognitive agent (Meyer, 1956), called the appreciator in\nthe present context (Nake, 1974), hedonic value is minimized in cases of plain banality and\noverburdening originality (Moles, 1966; Nake, 1974, 2012; V\u00f6lz, 1988). Applied to a recent\nstudy on the appreciation of closure effects (cadences) in Western tonal music (Cheung et al,\n2019), the suggested measure of pragmatic information provides a phenomenological model\nof the experimental results. Vanishing in the cases of banality and originality, pragmatic infor-\nmation qualitatively correlates with high aesthetic pleasure for predictable closures in rather\nuncertain contexts and also for surprising closures in more certain contexts.\nThe unpretentious phenomenological model of aesthetic appraisal presented here, is based\non a binary repertoire X = X0 of maximal coarse grain that produces a stochastic Bernoulli\nprocess of uncorrelated events. In order to discuss computational models of aesthetic appre-\nciation as well, one has to consider a hierarchy of repertoires Xk (k \u2208 No), where Xk+1 is\na refinement of Xk. Nake (1974, 2012) described aesthetic appreciation as an iterative algo-\nrithm that converges toward some optimal Xn where the Shannon entropy of the repertoire\nAn has dropped below a given memory capacity, while that of its immediate refinement Xn+1\nslightly exceeds that threshold.\nA related, though quite different account, was suggested by Mizraji (2023). He illustrated\nthe effect of aesthetic emotions by means of photomosaics (Silvers, 1996), where a repertoire\nof a certain grain Xn is provided by the mosaic tiles comprising some picture on a much\nlarger scale. Beim Graben (2024) has further augmented Mizraji's (2023) argument by draw-\ning an analogy to the Beauty of Fractals (Peitgen and Richter, 1986). This analogy allows\nfor an interpretation of Kant's philosophical aesthetics, mentioned in the Introduction (Kant,\n1790/1914). Identifying \"Imagination\" in Kant's theory with the capability to select appropri-\nate repertoires and his \u201cUnderstanding\" with the faculty of data compression of an aesthetic\nobject or event, the \"free harmonious play\" of the mental faculties describes a never-ending,\nthough converging process of aesthetic valuation, limn\u2192\u221e Xn."}]}

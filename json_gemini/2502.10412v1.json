To address this question, we propose a methodology consisting of two key components. First, it involves identifying relevant indicators within national AI strategies. Second, it assesses the alignment between these indicators and the strategic actions of a specific government's AI strategy, allowing for a critical evaluation of its monitoring measures. In addition, identifying these indicators helps to assess the overall quality of the strategy structure.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the main drivers for the development of cutting-edge technologies that are impacting society at different levels [1-3]. \u03a4o harness the benefits of AI, while mitigating the risks, governments are developing National Strategies, seeking geopolitical protagonism and leveraging economic, social and cultural progress [4]. Launched in 2017, the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy [5] was the first national strategy with the goal of guiding the priorities of AI policy at the country level [6]. Finland also developed its national AI strategy in 2017, closely followed by Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom in 2018. More than 30 other countries and regions have launched their AI strategies as of 2021\u00b9, including Brazil.\nThe formulation of long-term plans such as National Artificial Intelligence Strategies provides a comprehensive perspective on government initiatives aimed at social and economic development over periods of five years or more. A strategic plan should ideally articulate how a nation envisions the opportunities presented by AI, considering the strengths and weaknesses of the country [7]. This vision should guide capability-building efforts, including targeted investments across various sectors and industries, as well as the development of regulatory frameworks and governance protocols to mitigate AI-related risks [7, 8]. Thus, strategic plans in the public sector serve as an essential roadmap, outlining national priorities and the pathways to achieve them. Although not flawless, these plans can mirror current perspectives of the countries on how to engage with the advances regarding AI [9, 10]. Recently, artificial intelligence strategies at various levels of government have been under development and are expected to receive increased attention in the coming years, given that AI is intricately linked to numerous policy areas where responsibilities are already distributed between national and subnational levels [11].\nUsually, a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy begins by providing a diagnosis of the country's situation regarding AI, detailing current capabilities, infrastructural strengths, challenges, and potential avenues for growth [7]. This analysis serves as the foundation for defining strategies and action plans across various dimensions, such as Research and Innovation, Education and Workforce Development, Digital Infrastructure, Ethics and Regulation, Sectoral Applications, Social Inclusion and Diversity, Security and Defense, and International Collaboration [7, 8, 12]. Despite the similarity in the dimensions considered in the strategies, nations have pursued distinct priorities, such as academic excellence in Canada, skills development in South Korea, technological sovereignty in Germany, and education and AI services for public administration in Finland [6].\nMost strategies contain aspirational plans and do not elaborate on the actual implementation roadmaps or tracking mechanisms [7, 12]. These mechanisms, once defined and disclosed, are typically made available in documents updating the original plan (as presented by Germany [13] and France [14]), in"}, {"title": "2 Monitoring National AI Strategies", "content": "Once an AI strategy is defined, it is essential to monitor its progress and measure the impact of its programs and initiatives to enable continuous improvement. Regardless of the specific monitoring and control mechanisms employed by various countries and commissions worldwide, these mechanisms must be comprehensive enough to track and assess all aspects of the AI plan in question. As highlighted by the European Commission in its 2021 review of the Coordinated Plan on AI [21], Member States are encouraged to develop and promote instruments that facilitate regular monitoring, coordination, and evaluation of AI policy actions. Likewise, as noted in [4], the Member States"}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "We present the methodology for defining indicators for monitoring National Artificial Intelligence Strategies. It is structured into two main stages, which in turn include various activities, as discussed below."}, {"title": "3.1 Stage 1: Identification of strategic and relevant AI indicators", "content": "In this stage, the objective is to identify the most relevant indicators used to monitor AI strategies. The starting point is a predefined list of indicators, gathered from readily available databases such as socioeconomic census data and other government agency reports related to science, technology, and innovation. The indicators from this preliminary list are then compared with those found in pre-selected national AI strategies, chosen according to criteria of geopolitical relevance to the country in question. For instance, Brazil might wish to compare its indicators with other Latin American economies, such as Argentina or Mexico, to other advanced developing countries, or indeed BRICS nations, as well as international benchmark countries like some or all of the G7 nations. Another simple but important consideration is the emphasis and robustness of use of indicators by the mentioned strategies, since some may be more keen than others to draw and justify their conclusions from quantitative data.\nConsidering the indicators found in the national strategies that stand out, we identify relevant ones, which were not present in the preliminary list. The selection of new indicators is guided by their frequency in the surveyed documents and their effective role in shaping situational analyses and incentive policies.\nThe stage 1 process involves the following activities:\n\u2022 Activity 1.1: Definition of a preliminary list of indicators. This list may include those already highlighted in the strategy of the analysed country. A taxonomy shall be defined to categorise these indicators.\n\u2022 Activity 1.2: Selection of a set of countries for the study, based on the following criteria: (i) global leadership in AI; (ii) continental and/or regional representativeness; (iii) development stage compatible with the scenario of the analysed country. Other criteria can be defined and used without compromising the proposed methodology.\n\u2022 Activity 1.3: Retrieval of National AI Strategies, or equivalent documents such as plans and policies, of all sample countries. We suggest starting with the OECD thematic portal [24].\n\u2022 Activity 1.4: Identification of standout National AI Strategies in relation to the adoption of indicators. We propose to consider as standout National AI Strategies those with a number of indicators greater than a predefined threshold.\n\u2022 Activity 1.5: Identification of the presence and analysis of the prevalence of the initial list of indicators in the National AI Strategies. From the documents gathered in Activity 1.3, it is possible to classify these indicators according to their prevalence among the selected countries as a preliminary metric of their international strategic relevance. For each indicator $i$, we compute its frequency $f_i$ among the sample countries and determine the"}, {"title": "3.2 Stage 2: Correspondence between relevant indicators and the structure of the analyzed strategy", "content": "In this stage, the objective is to relate the set of indicators identified in Stage 1 to the thematic structure of the national AI strategy being analyzed. The activities in Stage 2 are organized as follows:\n\u2022 Activity 2.1: Identification of the thematic structure of the strategy. This involves determining the core themes, axes, or dimensions that define the strategy's key objectives. These elements act as the guiding framework, shaping the overall direction and focus of the strategy.\n\u2022 Activity 2.2: Development of a quantitative tool to assess the degree of correspondence between the consolidated set of indicators and the thematic structure of the analyzed strategy. This tool will quantify how well the indicators reflect the key components, axes, and dimensions outlined in the strategy, enabling accurate monitoring and evaluation of progress.\n\u2022 Activity 2.3: Definition of visualization tools that effectively display the correspondences identified in Activity 2.2. These tools will be designed to"}, {"title": "3.3 Stage 3: Identifying Patterns", "content": "In this stage, the goal is to highlight patterns identified in the correspondence analysis from the previous stage. The results obtained here allow for the selection of indicators to be incorporated into the strategy. Additionally, potential improvements to the structure of the analyzed strategy can be identified. Although structural differences between national strategies are influenced by varying scientific, technological, and economic priorities, a lack of correspondence between highly relevant indicators and the strategy's framework may indicate a blind spot in the analyzed strategy.\nFor instance, in the Brazilian case, as discussed in Section 4.3, this method exposed specific gaps where key indicators prevalent in national strategies were not well-aligned with the existing thematic structure. As a result of this analysis, several potential improvements to the strategy were proposed and are detailed in Section 4.4."}, {"title": "4 Application: The Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy", "content": "The Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy (Estrat\u00e9gia Brasileira de Intelig\u00eancia Artificial - EBIA) [20] is a comprehensive document developed by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovations of Brazil, aimed at fostering and regulating Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the country. Its goal is to promote the ethical and responsible development of AI, maximizing its social and economic benefits while addressing potential risks and challenges.\nEBIA adopts a holistic approach, structured around three cross-cutting axes and six vertical axes, forming an ideal 3 \u00d7 6 matrix, as shown in Figure 1. This structure defines a total of nine thematic axes, each tackling critical"}, {"title": "4.1 Stage 1", "content": "In the present case study, Activity 1.1 relies on a preliminary list of indicators provided by the Center for Management and Strategic Studies (CGEE), a Brazilian social organization affiliated with the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation. Established in 2001, CGEE's mission is to conduct forward-looking studies and research in science and technology, as well as to evaluate the economic and social impacts of scientific and technological policies, programs, and projects. The preliminary list from CGEE consists of 56 indicators grouped into seven dimensions, which we categorize alphabetically as follows:\nA. Adoption and use of AI-based applications\nB. Knowledge production\nC. Training\nD. Skills and employment\nE. Monitoring of international agendas\nF. Monitoring of political debates and regulatory aspects\nG. Monitoring of trends and innovation\nEach indicator is assigned a unique alphanumeric code, ranging from Al to G1, to simplify internal referencing. The complete list is presented in Table 10 of Appendix A.\nNext, we select a set of countries for the study. We chose 13 countries based on the criteria outlined in Activity 1.2, aiming for a representative sample:\nSouth Africa, Germany, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, South Korea, USA, France, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The selection includes countries from all continents, three Latin American nations (including one Mercosur member), two European Union members (plus the UK), five G7 countries, and three BRICS members.\nAfter selecting the countries, Activity 1.3 involves searching for the National Artificial Intelligence Strategies or equivalent documents of the selected countries, using the OECD thematic portal [24] as a starting point.\nOnly South Africa lacks a formal document for its National AI Strategy, and thus it is excluded from further analysis. Table 2 provides a brief qualitative analysis of these documents, contextualizing each nation's approach to systematically collecting AI indicators."}, {"title": "4.2 Stage 2", "content": "In Stage 2, we aimed to align the relevant indicators with the structure of the analyzed strategy. Initially, we considered quantifying this by counting the number of strategic actions linked to each indicator within each EBIA axis. However, the number of strategic actions per axis varies significantly (from 5 to 15), meaning that the number of correlations to be checked against 30 indicators across 9 axes would range from 1,350 to 4,050. Since this process requires manual conceptual analysis and cannot be automated, we determined it would be impractical. Additionally, the usefulness of such detailed counting for public policy remains unclear.\nTherefore, as a first approximation, we adopt a simple binary correspondence analysis between indicators and axes, considering them related whenever an indicator directly serves the conceptual purpose of an axis or at least one of its specific strategic actions (defined in Table 11). In particular, the conceptual purpose was formulated based on examination and summary of the corresponding detailed description in the EBIA text. We also developed a resource for visualizing this correspondence. Given the dual nature of EBIA's thematic structure - between its ideal 3 \u00d7 6 matrix arrangement and the set of 9 independent axes - we adopted an extended 4\u00d77 matrix arrangement. This matrix situates each indicator at the intersection of a vertical and a transversal axis,"}, {"title": "4.3 Stage 3", "content": "In Stage 3, we highlight some patterns identified in the correspondence analysis of the previous stage."}, {"title": "4.4 Elements for improving EBIA", "content": "The benchmarking conducted yielded important findings that go beyond the fundamental objective of identifying relevant indicators on the international stage. Indeed, through detailed analysis of the NAIS, points were identified that could support the improvement of EBIA through a revision process capable of aligning it more closely with international best practices, as well as addressing specific issues within the Brazilian context.\nA first point to highlight is the observation of different structures in the studied NAIS. Some are guided, from their conception, by clear and measurable quantitative indicators; others are organized qualitatively around national thematic interests. EBIA, by contrast, adopts a different structure based on general thematic axes, which are supposed to communicate through a matrix arrangement, unfolding into a set of approximately 50 strategic actions. We also note, in passing, that unlike some NAIS, EBIA does not initially assign its strategic actions to particular execution actors.\nDue to its broader axes, EBIA's structure allowed for a good accommodation of the indicators identified in international benchmarking. However, it should be noted that this result would occur even for other sets of indicators analyzed in the study but not selected for Product 3. This highlights a potentially limiting characteristic of EBIA, namely the lack of more clearly defined focuses capable of guiding decision-making instances in the planning, execution, and monitoring of the strategy.\nThe matrix structure of EBIA, which relates the six vertical thematic axes and three transverse axes, is conceptually interesting as it allows for addressing complex aspects from a multi-sectoral perspective. Nevertheless, the conceptual detailing and strategic actions associated with each of the nine axes are presented independently, which does not adequately emphasize the expected intersections within a matrix arrangement.\nGiven these observations, some insights can be envisioned for a revision process of E\u0392\u0399\u0391:\n1. More detailed and assertive definition of objectives, goals, actions, and monitoring strategies for EBIA. Building upon the conceptual framework of EBIA, there is room for delineating and deepening strategic actions, relying precisely on the indicators mentioned here to quantify the diagnosis and goals for public policies derived from the strategy.\n2. Implementation of an organization into axes that truly follows a matrix rationality in all aspects. The challenges of implementing an artificial intelligence strategy in Brazil, which presents a high level of complexity across various socioeconomic and regional perspectives, require in-depth dialogue between different levels of government, as well as close engagement with academia, the public and private innovation ecosystem, and the broader productive sector. The formulation of a truly matrix structure is an interesting tool to leverage synergies among different stakeholders involved in AI"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This study proposed a generic methodology for monitoring National Artificial Intelligence Strategies (NAIS), demonstrating its applicability through the Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy (EBIA). The developed approach was structured into two main components: identifying relevant indicators in the international landscape and analyzing the alignment between these indicators and the strategic actions outlined in the evaluated strategy. This analysis not only assessed the effectiveness of the monitoring measures but also provided insights into the structural quality of the strategy.\nThe application of the proposed methodology requires a set of preliminary information to support some of its stages. While this requirement can be seen as the main limitation of our proposal, information on NAIS, as discussed throughout this work, is now accessible (or indexed) through various sources, including the OECD AI Policy Observatory. Moreover, information regarding the local context of certain countries has also been made available by national observatories and local agencies.\nRegarding the case study carried out in this work, the application to EBIA identified specific points that could support its improvement, both in terms of alignment with international best practices and in addressing issues specific to the Brazilian context. These results underscore the importance of periodic reviews of national strategies. The proposed methodology has a generic nature, making it adaptable and applicable to other NAIS, presenting itself as a valuable tool for governments seeking to monitor, evaluate, and strengthen their artificial intelligence strategies."}]}

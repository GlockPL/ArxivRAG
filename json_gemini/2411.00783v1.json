{"title": "From Chalkboards to Chatbots: SELAR Assists Teachers in Embracing AI in the Curriculum", "authors": ["Hani Alers", "Aleksandra Malinowska", "Mathis Mourey", "Jasper Waaijer"], "abstract": "This paper introduces SELAR, a framework designed to effectively help teachers integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into their curriculum. The framework was designed by running workshops organized to gather lecturers' feedback. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of the framework through additional workshops organized with lecturers from the Hague University of Applied Sciences. The workshops tested the application of the framework to adapt existing courses to leverage generative AI technology. Each participant was tasked to apply SELAR to one of their learning goals in order to evaluate AI integration potential and, if successful, to update the teaching methods accordingly. Findings show that teachers were able to effectively use the SELAR to integrate generative AI into their courses. Future work will focus on providing additional guidance and examples to use the framework more effectively.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly recognized as a transformative force in education, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance teaching and learning processes (Luckin, Holmes, Griffiths, & Forcier, 2016; Zawacki-Richter, Mar\u00edn, Bond, & Gouverneur, 2019). \u0391\u0399 technologies have the potential to personalize learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, and provide intelligent tutoring systems that adapt to individual student needs (Chen, Chen, & Lin, 2020; Holmes, Bialik, & Fadel, 2019). These advancements can lead to improved educational outcomes by catering to diverse learning styles and enabling educators to focus on higher-order teaching activities (Tuomi, 2019; Miao, Holmes, Huang, & Zhang, 2021).\n\nDespite the promising benefits, integrating AI into educational settings presents significant challenges. A critical barrier is the lack of preparedness among educators to effectively incorporate Al technologies into their curricula (Celik, Dindar, Muukkonen, & J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, 2022; Ayanwale, Adelana, Molefi, Adeeko, & Ishola, 2024). Many teachers report insufficient knowledge and skills related to AI, leading to uncertainty and resistance toward adopting these tools (Williamson, 2016; King & ChatGPT, 2023). Moreover, concerns about academic integrity have emerged with the advent of generative AI tools capable of producing human-like text, raising questions about assessment and plagiarism (Cotton, Cotton, & Shipway, 2024)."}, {"title": "2. Explaining the SELAR framework", "content": "The SELAR framework is an innovative tool designed to assist educators in adapting their curriculum to ensure it copes with recent generative AI developments. As Celik et al. (2022) note, Al's potential to improve teaching practices and educational outcomes is contingent upon addressing challenges such as AI-focused teacher training, ethical considerations, and integration into existing educational frameworks. Continuous research and robust support systems are crucial for the successful implementation of Al in education. Furthermore, McArthur et al. (2005) point out that involving teachers in the curriculum development process is essential for ensuring that Al educational tools are both relevant and accessible. This alignment with the needs of teachers facilitates the successful integration of AI in classrooms. We designed the SELAR framework to be teacher-focused for that very reason.\n\nThis framework empowers teachers to integrate AI concepts into their courses, thus preparing students for a technology-driven world. By systematically evaluating and updating the learning goals of the courses, the framework ensures that educational content remains relevant and effective in the context of modern AI advancements. The process involves two key workflows when updating a given course."}, {"title": "2.1. Workflow Learning Goals: updating learning goals", "content": "The first workflow (shown in Figure 1) reassesses each learning goal of the course to identify potential areas for AI integration and ensure assessments remain AI-proof. The workflow outlines the process of AI-proofing learning goals and utilizing AI tools in an educational setting. The workflow can be applied to any learning goal in a given course. The workflow has 15 blocks as explained below\u00b9.\n\n1. Examine the learning goal\n\nStart by conducting a detailed evaluation of the learning goal. Consider its relevance in today's educational environment, where students have access to advanced AI tools. Determine whether the goal addresses essential skills and if it aligns with the current learning outcomes. This step is crucial to ensure that the goal remains aligned with the professional competencies required in the field, particularly in areas where Al may already play a role.\n\n2. Can part of the learning goal be automated with AI?\n\nIn this block, evaluate if certain tasks within the learning goal can be automated through Al tools. For example, tasks such as generating reports, running simple statistical analysis, or summarizing content may be handled by AI. However, you must carefully assess whether automating these tasks will still allow students to grasp the essential competencies the course aims to teach for the rest of their education.\n\n\u2022\tIf Yes, move to Block 3 to consider whether AI usage aligns with the learning goals.\n\n\u2022\tIf No, proceed directly to Block 11 to finalize the learning goal without AI intervention, ensuring that the goal remains hands-on and relevant to student learning.\n\n3. Is it acceptable to use AI assistance for this learning goal?\n\nThis block involves a deeper analysis of the educational value of allowing AI to perform certain tasks. Consider whether all the skills covered by this learning goal are crucial for students to master manually or if some can be supported by AI. You need to reflect on whether reliance on AI would detract from the core learning outcomes or complement them. This decision requires an understanding of whether automating the task fits into the broader educational context.\n\n\u2022\tIf Yes, proceed to Block 6 to adapt the learning goal to incorporate AI.\n\n\u2022\tIf No, move to Block 4, where you will explore how to prevent students from using AI to bypass important aspects of the learning goal. Ensuring that students are learning the intended skills is crucial in this case.\n\n4. Is AI-proof assessment possible?"}, {"title": "5.1 Link to literature", "content": "The positive reception of the SELAR framework by participating teachers resonates with previous studies emphasizing the need for practical tools to facilitate AI integration in education (Holmes et al., 2019; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019). Teachers appreciated the structured approach of SELAR, which supports the notion that educators benefit from clear guidelines when adopting new technologies (Lin & Van Brummelen, 2021). This finding aligns with Celik et al. (2022), who highlighted that teacher training and support are critical for successful AI implementation.\n\nHowever, the participants also expressed a need for additional guidance and resources, such as instructional videos and examples. This echoes the challenges identified by Ayanwale et al. (2024), where pre-service teachers required more comprehensive training to develop A\u0399 literacy. The concerns about assessment integrity in the era of AI, particularly regarding generative AI tools like ChatGPT, mirror the issues raised by Cotton et al. (2024) and King and ChatGPT (2023) about academic integrity and plagiarism.\n\nMoreover, the participants' desire for collaborative elements and peer discussions during the implementation process supports the findings of Vazhayil et al. (2019), who advocated for collaborative teacher education approaches to introduce AI in schools. The need for iterative refinement of the framework is consistent with the recommendations of iterative design processes in educational technology (Luckin & Holmes, 2016)."}, {"title": "5.2 Practical implications", "content": "The SELAR framework has the potential to be a valuable tool for educators across various educational contexts. Its structured approach enables teachers to systematically evaluate and update their learning goals and teaching materials in response to AI advancements.

This small and localized sample limits the generalizability of the findings. Future research should include a larger and more diverse group of participants from different institutions and disciplines to enhance the validity of the results.\n\n\u2022\tShort-term evaluation: The assessment of the framework's effectiveness was based on initial workshops and immediate feedback. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the sustained impact of the SELAR framework on teaching practices and student learning outcomes over time.\n\n\u2022\tLimited scope of AI tools: The study focused on generative AI technologies, but AI encompasses a wide range of tools and applications. Expanding the framework to address other AI technologies could provide a more comprehensive approach to AI integration.\n\n\u2022\tPotential bias: Participants may have had varying levels of interest and familiarity with AI, which could influence their perceptions of the framework. Future studies should control for such variables or include measures to assess participants' baseline competencies."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion", "content": "Al's potential to improve teaching practices and educational outcomes is contingent upon addressing challenges such as AI-focused teacher training, ethical considerations, and integration into existing educational frameworks. Continuous research and robust support systems are crucial for the successful implementation of AI in education (Celik et al., 2022).\n\nIn this study, we presented the SELAR framework, designed to assist teachers in updating their courses to align with advancements in AI. We assess its effectiveness with data collected from five workshops conducted with lecturers from various fields at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. They unanimously appreciated the framework for its structured approach, which facilitates the integration of AI in their teaching. However, they suggest that additional detailed guidelines, including instructional videos and examples, would improve their understanding and application of the framework.\n\nOur research also revealed that the workflows could benefit from some modifications. Lecturers expressed confusion about the assessment of learning goals, specifically highlighting the need for clearer definitions. Additionally, they sometimes found the sequence of steps in Workflow Learning Materials unclear, particularly regarding the order in which multiple prompts should be addressed. Our results align with the recommendation of Lin, P., & Van Brummelen (2021) that prioritizing teacher education and providing comprehensive training programs are essential to equip teachers with the necessary skills and confidence to effectively use AI technologies, ultimately benefiting students.\n\nThese results highlight both the strengths and areas for improvement in the framework, underscoring the ongoing journey to optimize AI integration in educational settings. The SELAR framework needs now to be updated using the results of this study and to be tested with a new iteration of workshops with lecturers2."}]}

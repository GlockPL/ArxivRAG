{"title": "Any four real numbers are on all fours with analogy", "authors": ["Yves Lepage", "Miguel Couceiro"], "abstract": "This work presents a formalization of analogy on numbers that relies on generalized means. It is motivated by recent advances in artificial intelligence and applications of machine learning, where the notion of analogy is used to infer results, create data and even as an assessment tool of object representations, or embeddings, that are basically collections of numbers (vectors, matrices, tensors). This extended analogy use asks for mathematical foundations and clear understanding of the notion of analogy between numbers. We propose a unifying view of analogies that relies on generalized means defined in terms of a power parameter. In particular, we show that any four increasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power. In addition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy and that any analogy equation has a solution for increasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers. These foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areas where representations are numerical.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Background and earlier work. In artificial intelligence, the terms analogical inference or analogical reasoning are often used. Related work focuses on the study of relationships between two pairs of objects A and B on the one hand, and of objects C and D on the other. There are several possible uses for such a configuration. Typically, one may want to judge whether the relationship between C and D is the same as that between A and B. The quality of the similarity of such relationships can be then assessed, and one can discuss attribute or relationship similarity [47], following the foundational work by Gentner [18]. One may also see A and C as problems, B as a solution to problem A, and ask whether the transposition of the ratio of A to B on C generates a D, and to what extent the generated D is a solution to problem C. This setting is at the core of case-based reasoning [4, 5, 29].\nThe underlying principle is that of analogical inference, and it has been integrated into various machine learning tasks such as preference learning and recommendation [15, 16, 33] and, more generally, in classification [11]. In addition, analogical extrapolation (inference) can solve difficult reasoning tasks such as tests of academic ability or visual question answering [6, 37, 43] or checking the meaning of a target sentence [52]. It can also support dataset augmentation through analogical extension and extrapolation [12] and guide computational creativity [20]. Also, analogical transfer can be realized by transfer learning [10, 2] where the idea is to take advantage of what has been learned in a source domain to improve the learning process in a target domain related or linked to the source domain. Finally, analogy creation can provide useful explanations that build on facts or counterfactuals [22] and guide counterfactual generation [24].\nIn particular domains such as machine translation, this type of analogical reasoning has been used [35, 26] and the connection with case-based reasoning is well recognized [9]. Still in natural language processing, analogy-based approaches have been used for the tasks of morphological analysis [41, 42] or word generation [17]. For instance, [34] proposes to minimize the algorithmic complexity of the program describing the ratio of A to B, i.e., the transformation of A into B, and then apply the program of minimum complexity to C to produce D, a new word, yielding high performance on a set of several million morphological analogies in a dozen languages.\nBut analogical reasoning is not exactly analogy. In everyday life, the English word analogy easily takes on the meaning of \"reasoning by analogy\" or even \"simple comparison\", and is quite often linked to fallacious reasoning. The present article is about mathematical analogy, which is not quite that. It is a relationship on a quadruple that does not privilege any particular ratio, for instance, that of A to B in preference to that of C to D, nor does it favor a particular direction, for instance, from A to B in preference to B to A, nor does this view favor one term over the others, even if they are not all interchangeable. The properties of interchangeability, which will be recalled in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, have already been the subject of observations and debate since antiquity, see e.g., the Encyclop\u00e9die [8].\nMotivation and recent work. The recent increasing interest in analogies and analogical reasoning was partially due to the successes of deep learning together with distributional representations (embeddings). For instance, [14, 32] show that vector representations of quadruples respecting certain linear transformations satisfy common properties of analogies, whereas [45] unveils the potential analogies as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of embedding models. This exploration has extended to complex structures such as knowledge graphs (KG) over multimodal domains, to address tasks such as named entity recognition, link prediction, relation discovery (abduction) and KG bootstrapping and completion [48, 53, 23], by leveraging multimodal knowledge embeddings [46, 51, 50, 49]. Despite these impressive results by such analogy-based approaches in rather complex tasks, many works have questioned the retrieved analogical"}, {"title": "2 Generalized means and analogy", "content": "For a quick historical reminder on the mathematical notion of analogy in Greek antiquity, and to show the link to the notion of mean, let us recall that, according to some scholars, the Greek word for analogy (\"again the (same) ratio\") might have emerged after a period of indecision over how to refer to continuous analogy, i.e., $A:B::B: D$ (note the repetition of B) and to discrete analogy, i.e., $A: B :: C : D$. In the Nicomachean Ethics [3, 1131 a29 - 1131 b2] Aristotle repeats that there are two types of analogy each called discrete and continuous respectively, the first involving four terms, the second involving three terms, one of which is repeated.\n\"Analogy is an equality of ratios and comes in four terms at least. It is obvious that the discrete one is indeed in four terms. But so is the continuous one; [...] B is uttered twice [...]\"\nIn the case of a continuous analogy, with division as a ratio, b can be calculated in function of a and d:\n$a \\div b = b \\div d \\Leftrightarrow b^2 = a \\times d \\Leftrightarrow b = \\sqrt{a \\times d}$.\nThis formula for b is that of the geometric mean of a and d.\nIf the ratio is subtraction, then, again for a continuous analogy :\n$a-b=b-d \\leftrightarrow 2 \\times b =a+d \\leftrightarrow b=\\frac{1}{2}(a+d)$\nHere, b is the arithmetic mean of a and d.\nFrom the above, it is clear that continuous analogy is intimately linked to the notion of a mean.\nThe Pythagoreans in the Antiquity and mathematicians of the Middle Ages have studied the links between the various conceivable means and analogy. Particular mention should be made of the studies on \"medieties\" (lat. medietas or mediocritas, cf. [31]). Table 1 illustrates one way, among others, of extracting the three arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means from similar, but discrete, analogies.\nThe generalization of the notion of a mean, unrelated to analogy, beyond arithmetic, geometric or harmonic means, was given in 1882 in an article by H\u00f6lder [21]. The aim of the present article is to link the mathematical notion of analogy to this generalization of the notion of mean."}, {"title": "2.1 Definition of generalized means", "content": "The generalized mean of several real positive numbers $x_1, ... x_N$ is the value\n$m_p(x_1,...x_N)= \\lim_{r\\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i^r}$\nfor all $p \\in (-\\infty, +\\infty)$.

Figure 1 illustrates the curve obtained for the particular values a = 2 and d = 5.\nIt is tempting to think that the generalized mean function of two numbers would be a function that behaves like an odd function with respect to a particular value of p. But this is not usually the case. Figure 1 illustrates this.\nBefore turning to the results, we would like to point out that, in the following, we shall not go into detail on all the demonstrations, as they always adopt the same structure. In the general case where p is neither O nor infinite, the limit is not necessary, neither is taking the p-th root, the one-half factor can be eliminated and demonstrations can then directly exploit the formula $a^p + d^p$ or the equality $a^p + d^p = b^p + c^p$. In the case p = 0, the formulas of the geometric mean are used: $a \\times d$ or $a\\times d = b \\times c$. Finally, in the two infinite cases, formulas with min and max are used. We will also omit some proofs, but they are to be found in the Supplementary material."}, {"title": "2.3 Definition of analogy through generalized means", "content": "We can now define analogies in terms of generalized means.\nDefinition 1.

Observe that the definition puts the extremes and the means on each side of the equality sign. This slightly differs from usual understanding of analogy, clearly visible from the notation, that ratio is instrumental in analogy. For instance the standard intuitive interpretation of arithmetic analogy is a \u2212 b = c \u2212 d whereas the above definition states that a + d = b + c, which is fortunately equivalent.

We state that there should be an exchange of ratio when taking the inverse of the two terms in a ratio.\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 b) : (\u22121 \u00d7 c) ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 a) :: c : d$\nApplying the exchange of the means (see Section 2.5) implies:\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 b) : c ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 a) : d$\nFrom this, we can derive a natural extension for four negative numbers.\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 a) : (\u22121 \u00d7 b) ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 c) : (\u22121 \u00d7 d)$\nThis natural extension is justified as follows:\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 -1\u00d7b: -1\u00d7c::-p-1\u00d7a:-1\u00d7d$\n$\\Rightarrow -1\u00d7d:-1\u00d7c::-p-1\u00d7b:-1\u00d7a$\n$\\Rightarrow -1 xa:-1 \u00d7 b ::-p-1 \u00d7 c:-1 \u00d7 d,$\nwhere the first implication follows by parallel application of exchange of ratio when taking the inverse of the terms, the second implication follows by symmetry of conformity and the third one by reading inversion (see Section 2.5).\nThe only cases with negative numbers that remain to explore are the case where only one number is negative and the case where the means are both negative while the extremes are both positive (or the contrary, as the means and the extremes are interchangeable). These two cases remain open and constitute a topic for future research.\nThis extension still needs inspection as it requires care when manipulating it. For instance, composition of powers, seen in 3.5, cannot be applied when negative numbers are involved. Let us consider -3:-2::14:5 again. The following sequence of equivalences leads to a contradiction: a configuration of positive terms where the extremes do not frame the means, i.e., a configuration that is not an analogy in any real number power.\n$-3 : -2 ::^1 4 : 5 \u21d4 (-3)^2 : (-2)^2 ::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4^2 : 5^2$\n$\\Rightarrow 3^2:2^2 ::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4^2:5^2$\n$\\Rightarrow 3:2::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4:5,$\nand the latter is clearly false: 3 : 2\u00b94:5."}, {"title": "5.2 Analogy with non-real powers or terms", "content": "In Subsection 3.1", "a": "b ::Pc:d"}, {"a": "c ::qd : b and a : d ::rb : c?

It is motivated by recent advances in artificial intelligence and applications of machine learning, where the notion of analogy is used to infer results, create data and even as an assessment tool of object representations, or embeddings, that are basically collections of numbers (vectors, matrices, tensors). This extended analogy use asks for mathematical foundations and clear understanding of the notion of analogy between numbers. We propose a unifying view of analogies that relies on generalized means defined in terms of a power parameter. In particular, we show that any four increasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power. In addition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy and that any analogy equation has a solution for increasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers. These foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areas where representations are numerical.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Background and earlier work. In artificial intelligence, the terms analogical inference or analogical reasoning are often used. Related work focuses on the study of relationships between two pairs of objects A and B on the one hand, and of objects C and D on the other. There are several possible uses for such a configuration. Typically, one may want to judge whether the relationship between C and D is the same as that between A and B. The quality of the similarity of such relationships can be then assessed, and one can discuss attribute or relationship similarity [47], following the foundational work by Gentner [18]. One may also see A and C as problems, B as a solution to problem A, and ask whether the transposition of the ratio of A to B on C generates a D, and to what extent the generated D is a solution to problem C. This setting is at the core of case-based reasoning [4, 5, 29].\nThe underlying principle is that of analogical inference, and it has been integrated into various machine learning tasks such as preference learning and recommendation [15, 16, 33] and, more generally, in classification [11]. In addition, analogical extrapolation (inference) can solve difficult reasoning tasks such as tests of academic ability or visual question answering [6, 37, 43] or checking the meaning of a target sentence [52]. It can also support dataset augmentation through analogical extension and extrapolation [12] and guide computational creativity [20]. Also, analogical transfer can be realized by transfer learning [10, 2] where the idea is to take advantage of what has been learned in a source domain to improve the learning process in a target domain related or linked to the source domain. Finally, analogy creation can provide useful explanations that build on facts or counterfactuals [22] and guide counterfactual generation [24].\nIn particular domains such as machine translation, this type of analogical reasoning has been used [35, 26] and the connection with case-based reasoning is well recognized [9]. Still in natural language processing, analogy-based approaches have been used for the tasks of morphological analysis [41, 42] or word generation [17]. For instance, [34] proposes to minimize the algorithmic complexity of the program describing the ratio of A to B, i.e., the transformation of A into B, and then apply the program of minimum complexity to C to produce D, a new word, yielding high performance on a set of several million morphological analogies in a dozen languages.\nBut analogical reasoning is not exactly analogy. In everyday life, the English word analogy easily takes on the meaning of \"reasoning by analogy\" or even \"simple comparison\", and is quite often linked to fallacious reasoning. The present article is about mathematical analogy, which is not quite that. It is a relationship on a quadruple that does not privilege any particular ratio, for instance, that of A to B in preference to that of C to D, nor does it favor a particular direction, for instance, from A to B in preference to B to A, nor does this view favor one term over the others, even if they are not all interchangeable. The properties of interchangeability, which will be recalled in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, have already been the subject of observations and debate since antiquity, see e.g., the Encyclop\u00e9die [8].\nMotivation and recent work. The recent increasing interest in analogies and analogical reasoning was partially due to the successes of deep learning together with distributional representations (embeddings). For instance, [14, 32] show that vector representations of quadruples respecting certain linear transformations satisfy common properties of analogies, whereas [45] unveils the potential analogies as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of embedding models. This exploration has extended to complex structures such as knowledge graphs (KG) over multimodal domains, to address tasks such as named entity recognition, link prediction, relation discovery (abduction) and KG bootstrapping and completion [48, 53, 23], by leveraging multimodal knowledge embeddings [46, 51, 50, 49]. Despite these impressive results by such analogy-based approaches in rather complex tasks, many works have questioned the retrieved analogical"}, {"title": "2 Generalized means and analogy", "content": "For a quick historical reminder on the mathematical notion of analogy in Greek antiquity, and to show the link to the notion of mean, let us recall that, according to some scholars, the Greek word for analogy (\"again the (same) ratio\") might have emerged after a period of indecision over how to refer to continuous analogy, i.e., $A:B::B: D$ (note the repetition of B) and to discrete analogy, i.e., $A: B :: C : D$. In the Nicomachean Ethics [3, 1131 a29 - 1131 b2] Aristotle repeats that there are two types of analogy each called discrete and continuous respectively, the first involving four terms, the second involving three terms, one of which is repeated.\n\"Analogy is an equality of ratios and comes in four terms at least. It is obvious that the discrete one is indeed in four terms. But so is the continuous one; [...] B is uttered twice [...]\"\nIn the case of a continuous analogy, with division as a ratio, b can be calculated in function of a and d:\n$a \\div b = b \\div d \\Leftrightarrow b^2 = a \\times d \\Leftrightarrow b = \\sqrt{a \\times d}$.\nThis formula for b is that of the geometric mean of a and d.\nIf the ratio is subtraction, then, again for a continuous analogy :\n$a-b=b-d \\leftrightarrow 2 \\times b =a+d \\leftrightarrow b=\\frac{1}{2}(a+d)$\nHere, b is the arithmetic mean of a and d.\nFrom the above, it is clear that continuous analogy is intimately linked to the notion of a mean.\nThe Pythagoreans in the Antiquity and mathematicians of the Middle Ages have studied the links between the various conceivable means and analogy. Particular mention should be made of the studies on \"medieties\" (lat. medietas or mediocritas, cf. [31]). Table 1 illustrates one way, among others, of extracting the three arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means from similar, but discrete, analogies.\nThe generalization of the notion of a mean, unrelated to analogy, beyond arithmetic, geometric or harmonic means, was given in 1882 in an article by H\u00f6lder [21].

Figure 1 illustrates the curve obtained for the particular values a = 2 and d = 5.\nIt is tempting to think that the generalized mean function of two numbers would be a function that behaves like an odd function with respect to a particular value of p. But this is not usually the case. Figure 1 illustrates this.\nBefore turning to the results, we would like to point out that, in the following, we shall not go into detail on all the demonstrations, as they always adopt the same structure. In the general case where p is neither O nor infinite, the limit is not necessary, neither is taking the p-th root, the one-half factor can be eliminated and demonstrations can then directly exploit the formula $a^p + d^p$ or the equality $a^p + d^p = b^p + c^p$. In the case p = 0, the formulas of the geometric mean are used: $a \\times d$ or $a\\times d = b \\times c$. Finally, in the two infinite cases, formulas with min and max are used.

Observe that the definition puts the extremes and the means on each side of the equality sign. This slightly differs from usual understanding of analogy, clearly visible from the notation, that ratio is instrumental in analogy. For instance the standard intuitive interpretation of arithmetic analogy is a \u2212 b = c \u2212 d whereas the above definition states that a + d = b + c, which is fortunately equivalent.

It is therefore interesting to note that in all these cases, as has been seen above for cases of equality, p is not unique, and all values, including the infinite values, are valid.\nBut it is also possible to consider the analogy\n$0:1::1:0$\nwhich is equivalent to 1: 0 :: 0 : 1 by inversion of ratio (see [25] for a practical occurrence of this case). These two equivalent forms of the same analogy are explained by considering that the ratio is the logical negation. The equality of the ratios makes them valid.\nHowever, this analogy is not of the model that extends the analogy formulas between sets to Booleans [28], nor does it allow a justification based on the minimality of algorithmic complexity [39]. Nor does this analogy fit into analogy model in power p proposed in this article, for the reason that the terms are not arranged in ascending order no matter the equivalent forms considered."}, {"title": "5 Possible extensions and open problems", "content": "In this section, we discuss extensions of the previous results by inspecting the possibility of firstly defining analogy with negative terms and secondly examining the possibility of having non-real numbers, i.e., complex numbers for powers and terms."}, {"title": "5.1 Analogy with negative numbers", "content": "Let us start by remarking that \u22122 : \u22123 ::\u00b9 4 : 5 cannot be considered a valid analogy because we cannot write: \u22122 \u2212 (\u22123) = 4 \u2212 5, i.e., 1 = \u22121. On the contrary, \u22123 : \u22122 ::\u00b9 4 : 5 seems plausible as there is no problem in writing \u22123 \u2212 (\u22122) = 4 \u2212 5, i.e., \u22121 = \u22121. These examples lead us to understand that there exists a relationship between the signs of the terms of an analogy and their ordering.\nIn the remainder of this section, the terms a, b, c and d are positive real numbers. We propose to extend analogies with two negative terms based on the above examples. We state that there should be an exchange of ratio when taking the inverse of the two terms in a ratio.\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 b) : (\u22121 \u00d7 c) ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 a) :: c : d$\nApplying the exchange of the means (see Section 2.5) implies:\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 b) : c ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 a) : d$\nFrom this, we can derive a natural extension for four negative numbers.\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 (\u22121 \u00d7 a) : (\u22121 \u00d7 b) ::^p (\u22121 \u00d7 c) : (\u22121 \u00d7 d)$\nThis natural extension is justified as follows:\n$a:b::^p c:d \u21d2 -1\u00d7b: -1\u00d7c::-p-1\u00d7a:-1\u00d7d$\n$\\Rightarrow -1\u00d7d:-1\u00d7c::-p-1\u00d7b:-1\u00d7a$\n$\\Rightarrow -1 xa:-1 \u00d7 b ::-p-1 \u00d7 c:-1 \u00d7 d,$\nwhere the first implication follows by parallel application of exchange of ratio when taking the inverse of the terms, the second implication follows by symmetry of conformity and the third one by reading inversion (see Section 2.5).\nThe only cases with negative numbers that remain to explore are the case where only one number is negative and the case where the means are both negative while the extremes are both positive (or the contrary, as the means and the extremes are interchangeable). These two cases remain open and constitute a topic for future research.\nThis extension still needs inspection as it requires care when manipulating it. For instance, composition of powers, seen in 3.5, cannot be applied when negative numbers are involved. Let us consider -3:-2::14:5 again. The following sequence of equivalences leads to a contradiction: a configuration of positive terms where the extremes do not frame the means, i.e., a configuration that is not an analogy in any real number power.\n$-3 : -2 ::^1 4 : 5 \u21d4 (-3)^2 : (-2)^2 ::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4^2 : 5^2$\n$\\Rightarrow 3^2:2^2 ::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4^2:5^2$\n$\\Rightarrow 3:2::^{\\frac{1}{2}} 4:5,$\nand the latter is clearly false: 3 : 2\u00b94:5."}, {"title": "5.2 Analogy with non-real powers or terms", "content": "In Subsection 3.1", "a": "b ::Pc:d"}, {"a": "c ::qd : b and a : d ::rb : c?

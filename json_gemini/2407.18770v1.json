We provide a unifying view of analogies that relies on generalized means defined in terms of a power parameter. In particular, we show that any four increasing positive real numbers is an analogy in a unique suitable power. In addition, we show that any such analogy can be reduced to an equivalent arithmetic analogy and that any analogy equation has a solution for increasing numbers, which generalizes without restriction to complex numbers. These foundational results provide a better understanding of analogies in areas where representations are numerical.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Background and earlier work. In artificial intelligence, the terms analogical inference or analogical reasoning are often used. Related work focuses on the study of relationships between two pairs of objects A and B on the one hand, and of objects C and D on the other. There are several possible uses for such a configuration. Typically, one may want to judge whether the relationship between C and D is the same as that between A and B. The quality of the similarity of such relationships can be then assessed, and one can discuss attribute or relationship similarity [47], following the foundational work by Gentner [18]. One may also see A and C as problems, B as a solution to problem A, and ask whether the transposition of the ratio of A to B on C generates a D, and to what extent the generated D is a solution to problem C. This setting is at the core of case-based reasoning [4, 5, 29].\nThe underlying principle is that of analogical inference, and it has been integrated into various machine learning tasks such as preference learning and recommendation [15, 16, 33] and, more generally, in classification [11]. In addition, analogical extrapolation (inference) can solve difficult reasoning tasks such as tests of academic ability or visual question answering [6, 37, 43] or checking the meaning of a target sentence [52]. It can also support dataset augmentation through analogical extension and extrapolation [12] and guide computational creativity [20]. Also, analogical transfer can be realized by transfer learning [10, 2] where the idea is to take advantage of what has been learned in a source domain to improve the learning process in a target domain related or linked to the source domain. Finally, analogy creation can provide useful explanations that build on facts or counterfactuals [22] and guide counterfactual generation [24].\nIn particular domains such as machine translation, this type of analogical reasoning has been used [35, 26] and the connection with case-based reasoning is well recognized [9]. Still in natural language processing, analogy-based approaches have been used for the tasks of morphological analysis [41, 42] or word generation [17]. For instance, [34] proposes to minimize the algorithmic complexity of the program describing the ratio of A to B, i.e., the transformation of A into B, and then apply the program of minimum complexity to C to produce D, a new word, yielding high performance on a set of several million morphological analogies in a dozen languages.\nBut analogical reasoning is not exactly analogy. In everyday life, the English word analogy easily takes on the meaning of \"reasoning by analogy\" or even \"simple comparison\", and is quite often linked to fallacious reasoning. The present article is about mathematical analogy, which is not quite that. It is a relationship on a quadruple that does not privilege any particular ratio, for instance, that of A to B in preference to that of C to D, nor does it favor a particular direction, for instance, from A to B in preference to B to A, nor does this view favor one term over the others, even if they are not all interchangeable. The properties of interchangeability, which will be recalled in Sections 2.4 and 2.5, have already been the subject of observations and debate since antiquity, see e.g., the Encyclop\u00e9die [8].\nMotivation and recent work. The recent increasing interest in analogies and analogical reasoning was partially due to the successes of deep learning together with distributional representations (embeddings). For instance, [14, 32] show that vector representations of quadruples respecting certain linear transformations satisfy common properties of analogies, whereas [45] unveils the potential analogies as a benchmark to evaluate the quality of embedding models. This exploration has extended to complex structures such as knowledge graphs (KG) over multimodal domains, to address tasks such as named entity recognition, link prediction, relation discovery (abduction) and KG bootstrapping and completion [48, 53, 23], by leveraging multimodal knowledge embeddings [46, 51, 50, 49]. Despite these impressive results by such analogy-based approaches in rather complex tasks, many works have questioned the retrieved analogical"}, {"title": "2 Generalized means and analogy", "content": "For a quick historical reminder on the mathematical notion of analogy in Greek antiquity, and to show the link to the notion of mean, let us recall that, according to some scholars, the Greek word for analogy (\"again the (same) ratio\") might have emerged after a period of indecision over how to refer to continuous analogy, i.e., A:B::B: D (note the repetition of B) and to discrete analogy, i.e., A: B :: C : D. In the Nicomachean Ethics [3, 1131 a29 - 1131 b2] Aristotle repeats that there are two types of analogy each called discrete and continuous respectively, the first involving four terms, the second involving three terms, one of which is repeated.\n\"Analogy is an equality of ratios and comes in four terms at least. It is obvious that the discrete one is indeed in four terms. But so is the continuous one; [...] B is uttered twice [...]\"\nIn the case of a continuous analogy, with division as a ratio, b can be calculated in function of a and d:\n$a \\div b = b \\div d \\Leftrightarrow b^2 = a \\times d \\Leftrightarrow b = \\sqrt{a \\times d}$.\nThis formula for b is that of the geometric mean of a and d.\nIf the ratio is subtraction, then, again for a continuous analogy :\n$a-b=b-d \\leftrightarrow 2\\times b=a+d \\leftrightarrow b=\\frac{1}{2}(a+d)$\nHere, b is the arithmetic mean of a and d.\nFrom the above, it is clear that continuous analogy is intimately linked to the notion of a mean.\nThe Pythagoreans in the Antiquity and mathematicians of the Middle Ages have studied the links between the various conceivable means and analogy. Particular mention should be made of the studies on \"medieties\" (lat. medietas or mediocritas, cf. [31]). Table 1 illustrates one way, among others, of extracting the three arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means from similar, but discrete, analogies.\nThe generalization of the notion of a mean, unrelated to analogy, beyond arithmetic, geometric or harmonic means, was given in 1882 in an article by H\u00f6lder [21]. The aim of the present article is to link the mathematical notion of analogy to this generalization of the notion of mean.\n2.1 Definition of generalized means\nThe generalized mean of several real positive numbers $x_1,...x_N$ is the value\n$m_p(x_1,...x_N) = \\lim_{r \\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^r}$\nfor all $p \\in (-\\infty, +\\infty)$. In particular, we find:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item the arithmetic mean for p = 1;\n    \\item the harmonic mean for p = -1;\n    \\item the root mean square for p = 2;\n    \\item the geometric mean when p tends to 0:\n\\end{itemize}\n$\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0}m_p (x_1,...x_N) = \\sqrt[N]{\\prod_{i=1}^{N} x_i}$.\nFinally, when p tends towards +\u221e, it is the maximum of the numbers, max(x1,...xv), and when p tends towards -\u221e, it is the minimum of the numbers, min(x1,...xN).\nRemark 1. This generalizes to the case when a, b, c, d and p are complex numbers, except, e.g., in the undefined cases $0^0$ for p < 0."}, {"title": "2.3 Definition of analogy through generalized means", "content": "We can now define analogies in terms of generalized means.\nDefinition 1. On four positive real numbers, we define analogy in power p as follows:\n$a : b ::^P c : d \\Leftrightarrow m_p(a,d) = m_p(b,c)$,\n$\\Rightarrow \\lim_{r \\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{2}(a^r + d^r)} =  \\lim_{r \\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{2}(b^r + c^r)}$.\nIn words, four positive real numbers a, b, c and d are in analogy, if and only if there exists a p such that the generalized mean in p of the extremes a and d is equal to the generalized mean in p of the means b and c. Observe that the definition puts the extremes and the means on each side of the equality sign. This slightly differs from usual understanding of analogy, clearly visible from the notation, that ratio is instrumental in analogy. For instance the standard intuitive interpretation of arithmetic analogy is a - b = c d whereas the above definition states that a + d = b + c, which is fortunately equivalent. This definition raises several questions: firstly, under what conditions we can find a p such that the analogy holds and, secondly, to determine this p."}, {"title": "2.4 Reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity of ::P", "content": "For the reflexivity of $::^P$, it is trivial to note that, for any two positive real numbers a and b, for any p, we always have\n$a:b::^P a: b$,\n(1)\ni.e.,\n$\\lim_{r \\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{2}(a^r + b^r)} =  \\lim_{r \\rightarrow p} \\sqrt[p]{\\frac{1}{2}(b^r + a^r)}$.\n(2)\nThe symmetry of $::^P$ is expressed as follows:\n$a:b::^P c:d \\Leftrightarrow c:d::^P a: b$.\nIt is verified because:\n$a : b ::^Pc : d \\Rightarrow m_p(a,d) = m_p(b, c)$\n$m_p(b, c) = m_p(a,d)$\n$m_p(c,b) = m_p(d, a)$\n$c:d::^Pa: b$.\nLet us repeat that transitivity is not generally necessary for analogy. It just happens to exist for $::^P$, p different from 0 and infinity.

[3]). The equivalence between the original form a:b:cd and these two forms implies the other five.\nAs for the analogy by generalized mean, the inversion of the ratios is given by the symmetry of the equality in $m_p(b, c) = m_p(a,d)$.\nThe commutativity of addition in $(b + c)$, multiplication in $b \\times c$ and in min(b, c) or max(b, c) yields the permutation of the means.

Can they be real numbers or should they be complex numbers or any other kind of numbers?\n$\\begin{cases}\na:b::^P c:d \\\\\na: c::^Q d:b \\\\\na:d::^R b:c\n\\end{cases}\n\\Leftrightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\na + d = b + c\\\\\na^q + d^q = b^q + c^q\\\\\na^r + d^r = b^r + c^r\n\\end{cases}$\n$\\Leftrightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\na + d = b + c\\\\\na^q + (d \\times e^{i \\pi /q})^q = (b \\times e^{i \\pi /q})^q + c^q\\\\\na^r + (d \\times e^{i \\pi /r})^r = (b \\times e^{i \\pi /r})^r + c^r\n\\end{cases}$\nThe problem is the existence of such q and r and their possible analytical expression in function of p, a, b, c and d. Now, the latter system of equations, that is explained by recalling that $e^{i \\pi} = -1$ (and thus $(e^{i \\pi /q})^q = -1$), would suggest that complex number terms too should be considered to render an account of this enforcement of analogy on the three possible orderings. We leave this problem open."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "The approach taken in this article is a model-theoretic approach to analogy. We have studied the link between analogy and means, or more precisely, generalized means. We have leveraged this notion to generalize the notion of analogy on numbers and we defined a notion of analogy in power p. Classical analogies, like arithmetic analogy and geometric analogy, are obviously only special cases for p = 1 and p = 0 of analogy in power p.\nIn particular, we have shown that, given any four positive real numbers, it is always possible to see an analogy between them, thanks to a well-chosen power, which is unique if these numbers are all different. Put in another way; there is generally a unique perspective, i.e., a power p, under which we can see an analogy between any four positive numbers. We have also shown that any analogy can be reduced (by bijection) to a canonical form, giving rise to an infinite number of equivalent analogies. In particular, this shows that all analogies, including classical ones, can be treated by means of an equivalent arithmetic analogy.\nThis work opens up a number of new avenues. First of all, although general results can be obtained not only for four positive numbers, but also for some mixture of negative and positive real numbers and even some complex numbers, the landscape is still incomplete. Another avenue concerns the semantics of the parameter p which, in a way, summarizes the information implicit in a, b, c and"}]}

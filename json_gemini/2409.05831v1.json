{"title": "Applying Attribution Explanations in Truth-Discovery Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks", "authors": ["Xiang Yin", "Nico Potyka", "Francesca Toni"], "abstract": "Explaining the strength of arguments under gradual semantics is receiving increasing attention. For example, various studies in the literature offer explanations by computing the attribution scores of arguments or edges in Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). These explanations, known as Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) and Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs), commonly employ removal-based and Shapley-based techniques for computing the attribution scores. While AAEs and RAEs have proven useful in several applications with acyclic QBAFs, they remain largely unexplored for cyclic QBAFs. Furthermore, existing applications tend to focus solely on either AAEs or RAEs, but do not compare them directly. In this paper, we apply both AAEs and RAEs, to Truth Discovery QBAFs (TD-QBAFs), which assess the trustworthiness of sources (e.g., websites) and their claims (e.g., the severity of a virus), and feature complex cycles. We find that both AAEs and RAEs can provide interesting explanations and can give non-trivial and surprising insights.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Abstract argumentation Frameworks (AFs) [1] are promising tools in the Explainable AI (XAI) field [2] due to their transparency and interpretability, as well as their ability to support reasoning about conflicting information [3, 4, 5]. Quantitative Bipolar AFs (QBAFs) [6] are an extension of traditional AFs, which consider the (dialectical) strength of arguments and the support relation between arguments. In QBAFs, each argument has a base score, and its dialectical strength is computed by gradual semantics based on its base score and the strength of its attackers and supporters [7]. QBAFs can be deployed to support several applications like product recommendation [8], review aggregation [9] or stance aggregation [10].\nAnother interesting application that has been considered recently are truth discovery net-works [11, 12, 13]. Figure 1 shows an example of a Truth-Discovery QBAFs (TD-QBAF) to evaluate the trustworthiness of sources and the reliability of claims made about an exhibition. We have 11 sources and 6 claims, each represented as an abstract argument. The nodes on the left represent the 11 source arguments (s0 to s10), while the ones on the right represents the 6 claim arguments. The claim arguments are categorized into three types - year, place, and theme of the exhibition \u2013 each distinguished by different colors. For pairs of contradictory claims, where different values are asserted for the same object, a bi-directional attack relationship is introduced between the claims. For each report (one for each pair of source and claim), a bi-directional support relationship is established between the source and the claim. Following [13], we use a base score of 0.5 for source argument (we are initially indifferent about the trustworthiness of a source), and a base score of 0 for claims (we do not believe claims without evidence). We compute the dialectical strength of arguments using the Quadratic Energy (QE) gradual semantics [14], and the final strengths of arguments are displayed on their side in Figure 1. While the strength values seem plausible, it can be challenging to understand why certain claims and sources receive higher or lower trust scores.\nTo address this problem, attribution explanations (AEs) have been proposed. Specifically, given an argument of interest (topic argument) in a QBAF, AEs can explain the impact of arguments on the topic argument. AEs can be broadly categorized into Argument Attribution Explanations (AAEs) (e.g., [15, 16, 17]) and Relation Attribution Explanations (RAEs) (e.g., [18, 19]). AAEs explain the strength of the topic argument by assigning attribution scores to arguments: the greater the attribution score, the greater the argument's contribution to the topic argument. Similarly, RAEs assign the attribution scores to edges to measure their contribution. Removal-based and Shapley-based techniques are commonly used for computing the attribution scores.\nHowever, most existing studies focus on explaining acyclic QBAFs rather than cyclic ones, leaving a gap in understanding the complexities of the latter. In addition, current research typically examines only one type of attribution \u2013 either AAEs or RAEs \u2013 without providing a comprehensive comparison of both methods. In this paper, we aim to address these gaps by investigating the applicability of removal and Shapley-based AAEs and RAEs in the context of cyclic TD-QBAFs. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive comparison between them to better understand the applicability of these AEs."}, {"title": "2. Preliminaries", "content": "We briefly recall the definition of QBAFs and the QE gradual semantics [14]."}, {"title": "2.1. QBAFs and the QE Gradual Semantics", "content": "Definition 1 (QBAF). A Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) is a quadruple Q = <A,R\u207b,R\u207a,\u03c4) consisting of a finite set of arguments A, binary relations of attack R\u207b \u2286 A\u00d7A and support R\u207a \u2286 A\u00d7A(R\u207b\u2229R\u207a = \u00d8) and a base score function \u03c4 : A \u2192 [0, 1].\nThe base score function in QBAFs assigns an apriori belief to arguments. QBAFs can be represented graphically (as in Figure 1) using nodes to represent arguments and edges to show the relations between them. Then QBAFs are said to be (a)cyclic if the graphs representing them are (a)cyclic.\nIn this paper, we use the QE gradual semantics [14] to evaluate the strength of arguments in QBAFs. Like most QBAF semantics, it computes strength values iteratively by initializing the strength value of each argument with its base score and repeatedly applying an update function. Let us represent the strength of arguments in the i-th iteration by a function\n\u03c3\u2071 : A \u2192 [0, 1],\nwhere \u03c3\u2070(\u03b1) = \u03c4(\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 A. In order to compute \u03c3\u2071\u207a\u00b9 from \u03c3\u2071, the update function first computes the energy E of attackers and supporters of each argument \u03b1 defined by\nEi(\u03b1) = \u2211_{\u03b2\u2208A : (\u03b2,\u03b1)\u2208R\u207a} \u03c3\u2071(\u03b2) \u2212 \u2211_{\u03b2\u2208A : (\u03b2,\u03b1)\u2208R\u207b} \u03c3\u2071(\u03b2).\nIt then computes the strength in the next iteration via\n\u03c3^{i+1}(\u03b1) = \\begin{cases} \u03c4(\u03b1)- \u03c4(\u03b1) \\cdot \\frac{E_i^2}{1+(E_i)^2} & \\text{if } E_i \u2264 0; \\\\ \u03c4(\u03b1) + (1 \u2212 \u03c4(\u03b1))\\cdot \\frac{E_i^2}{1+(E_i)^2} & \\text{if } E_i>0. \\end{cases}\nThe final dialectical strength of each argument \u03b1 is then defined as the limit lim_{t\u2192\u221e} \u03c3\u1d57(\u03b1). In cyclic graphs, the strength values may start oscillating and the limit may not exist [20]. In all known cases, the problem can be solved by continuizing the semantics [14, 13]. However, we do not have space to discuss these issues in more detail here and will just restrict to examples where the strength values converge.\nTo better understand the QE gradual semantics, let us look at an example."}, {"title": "Example 1.", "content": "Consider the QBAF in Figure 2, where the base scores are given as \u03c4(\u03b1) = 0.8, \u03c4(\u03b2) = 0.6, \u03c4(\u03b3) = 0.9, and \u03c4(\u03b4) = 0.7.

Results and Analysis for AAEs", "content": "Figure 3 shows the results of removal and Shapley-based AAEs.\nFor the removal-based AAEs, we observe that s7, s8, s9, and s10 have noticeably positive influences on c5, followed by minor positive influences from s3, c1, and c2. This is because s7 to s10 are direct supporters for c5, whereas s3, c1, and c2 indirectly support c5. Specifically, c2 supports s3, s3 supports cl, cl supports s7, and then s7 supports c5, meaning s3, c1, and c2 all indirectly support c5. These indirect influences also explain why the AAEs of s3, c1, and c2 are much smaller than those of s7 to s10. Besides, since s7 is supported by c1, its AAE is slightly larger than those of s8 to s10, which have consistent AAEs due to their symmetrical structure to c5. In contrast, s0, s1, s2, and co have minor negative influences on c5 because co attacks cl, an indirect supporter for c5. Furthermore, s0 to s2 support c0, and thus they have negative influences on c5 as well. However, their negative influences are not obvious due to the indirect influences. Finally, the remaining arguments have AAEs close to 0, indicating their negligible influences on c5.\nWhen considering the Shapley-based AAEs, the results are similar to those of removal-based AAEs, where s7 to s10 still have significant influences on c5. Unlike removal-based AAEs, however, we notice that both c4 and s6 have minor negative influences on c5. This is because c4 directly attacks c5, while s6 indirectly attacks c5 by supporting c4, although the QE strength of c4 is very small (close to 0). Also, the negative influences of s0 to s2 and co and positive influence of c2 are relatively negligible compared with those of in removal-based AAEs due to their indirect connection to c5.\nIn this case study, both removal and Shapley-based AAEs can effectively capture the main influential arguments despite having some tiny differences in those low contributing arguments. This is mainly because of their different mechanisms of computing the AAEs. Another important reason is probably due to the approximation algorithm used for Shapley-based AAEs, leading to different AAEs even with the same sample size for the coalitions.

Results and Analysis for RAEs", "content": "Figure 4 shows the results of removal and Shapley-based RAEs.\nLet us first discuss the removal-based RAEs. We see that (s7, c5) has the largest positive impact on c5. Following closely are (s8, c5), (s9, c5), and (s10, c5), which also have notably positive influences on c5 because they are direct incoming supports to c5. There are also four outgoing supports from c5, namely (c5, s7), (c5, s8), (c5, s9), and (c5, s10), with positive influences but their RAEs are greatly smaller than that of the previous four as they are indirect supports. For instance, c5 first supports s7, and then s7 supports c5, indicating the indirect positive influence of (c5, s7). Additionally, (c5, c4) also contributes positively to c5 because c5 attacks its attacker c4, thus the attack from c4 to c5 is weakened. We can also observe some marginal influences, such as the positive influences provided by (c1, s7), (s3, c1), and (c2, s3) on c5, while the negative influences from (c0, c1), (s0, c0), (s1, c0), and (s2, c0). The remaining edges have RAEs close to 0, showing their negligible influence on c5.\nWhen it comes to the Shapley-based RAEs, which have similar effects to removal-based RAEs, the four incoming supports to c5 are still the major contributors, and the four outgoing supports from c5 have minor RAEs. Different from removal-based RAEs, Shapley-based RAEs capture some different negligible influences, such as the negative influence by (c4, c5) and (s6, c4). However, Shapley-based RAEs also disregard some tiny influences, like (s0, c0), (s1, c0), and (s2, c0), which are shown by removal-based RAEs.\nIn this case study, both removal and Shapley-based RAEs have a consistent ranking for the main influential edges despite having some tiny differences in those low contributing edges."}, {"title": "The reasons", "content": "are the same as we discussed above.\nLet us further compare the results of AAEs and RAEs. In this case study, we observe some connections between AAEs and RAEs. For example, in both AAEs, the top-4 influential arguments are s7 to s10, while in both RAEs, the outgoing edges from these arguments ((s7, c5), (s8, c5), (s9, c5), and (s10, c5)) also rank in the top-4. In addition, s0 to s4 and co to c2 have minor influences in the removal-based AAEs, while their incoming or outgoing edges also have minor influences in the removal-based RAEs. A similar phenomenon can be found in the Shapley-based AAEs and RAEs. While it is expected that the RAEs for outgoing edges of important arguments are relatively high, the consistency observed across different sets of arguments and edges is noteworthy. Besides, we found that removal or Shapley-based AAE of an argument does not necessarily equate to the sum of RAEs of all its incoming and outgoing edges, which goes against a reasonable expectation. We will leave the investigation of their formal relationships for future work."}, {"title": "4. Conclusion", "content": "Since most existing applications of AAEs and RAEs focus on acyclic QBAFs, this paper investigated their applicability in cyclic QBAFs. First, we found that AAEs and RAEs can provide intuitive explanations. By displaying the ranking of arguments or edges, it is easy to identify the most influential arguments or edges in the QBAF without delving into the complex (cyclic) structure of the QBAFs, particularly in TD-QBAFs where the number of arguments is typically large and the connections between source arguments and claim arguments are bi-directional. Second, AAEs and RAEs can provide interesting or even surprising explanations. For example, in the case study provided earlier, one might overlook the influence between claim arguments cl and c5 because they are in different topics (Year=1962 and Theme=Art), but AEs demonstrate that cl can contribute to c5 through s7. Third, RAEs provide more fine-grained explanations than AAEs. This is because when computing AAEs, such as removal-based AAEs, removing an argument means removing all the incoming and outgoing edges associated with that argument, whereas RAEs offer a more detailed insight by processing every incoming and outgoing edge individually. One can choose between them depending on the granularity for practical use.\nFor future work, it would be worthwhile to investigate how different gradual semantics influence AAEs and RAEs, because the property satisfaction of semantics have an influence on the property satisfaction of explanations. Additionally, the formal relationship between AAEs and RAEs requires further exploration. However, we believe AAEs and RAEs can complement each other, providing a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the internal mechanisms of QBAFs, particularly the interactions between arguments and edges in complex QBAFs."}]}

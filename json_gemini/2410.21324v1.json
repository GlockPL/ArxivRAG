{"title": "Mathematical Derivation Graphs: A Task for Summarizing Equation Dependencies in STEM Manuscripts", "authors": ["Vishesh Prasad", "Brian Kim", "Nickvash Kani"], "abstract": "Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), have significantly enhanced the field of textual analysis. However, while these developments have yielded substantial progress in analyzing textual data, applying analysis to mathematical equations and their relationships within texts has produced mixed results. In this paper, we take the initial steps toward understanding the dependency relationships between mathematical expressions in STEM articles. Our dataset, sourced from a random sampling of the arXiv corpus, contains an analysis of 107 published STEM manuscripts whose inter-equation dependency relationships have been hand-labeled, resulting in a new object we refer to as a derivation graph that summarizes the mathematical content of the manuscript. We exhaustively evaluate analytical and NLP-based models to assess their capability to identify and extract the derivation relationships for each article and compare the results with the ground truth. Our comprehensive testing finds that both analytical and NLP models (including LLMs) achieve ~40-50% F1 scores for extracting derivation graphs from articles, revealing that the recent advances in NLP have not made significant inroads in comprehending mathematical texts compared to simpler analytic models. While current approaches offer a solid foundation for extracting mathematical information, further research is necessary to improve accuracy and depth in this area.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "In natural language processing, the summarization task asks an algorithm to reduce a long piece of text into its most pertinent components. While this problem has been studied extensively for natural language texts (El-Kassas et al., 2021; Gambhir and Gupta, 2017), summarizing math-heavy texts remains a challenge for modern NLP techniques (Davis, 2024; Wu, 2024; Sundaram et al., 2022). These algorithms are rarely trained on symbolic mathematics central to math and physics manuscripts, necessitating new approaches to effectively process and summarize mathematical texts."}, {"title": "2 Problem Statement", "content": "Although the mathematical context in scholarly articles has been previously studied, significant limitations remain in effectively capturing and understanding mathematical relationships within these texts (Greiner-Petter et al., 2020; Chandrasekaran et al., 2020; Jo et al., 2021). Extracting and comprehending these relationships through derivation graphs is critical for tasks like representation learning and mathematical information retrieval (Pape and Tchoshanov, 2001; Van Nguyen et al., 2022; Gururaja et al., 2023; Aizawa and Kohlhase, 2021).\nThis research aims to understand the relationships between key equations presented in many STEM articles by extracting their derivation graphs. An example of an extracted derivation graph is shown in Figure 1, where nodes represent key math equations from the manuscript and directed edges between nodes, (u, v), indicate that equation v was derived from equation u within the text.\nSince manuscripts often contain hundreds of mathematical equations, many of which may be uninteresting (e.g., \u201ckb = 1.38 \u00b7 10-23 J \u00b7 K\u22121\"), we limit our derivation graph to only contain the most essential equations within a manuscript. We define key math equations as those explicitly labeled with a reference number in the manuscript, as seen in Figure 2. Qualitative analysis has shown that these numbered equations help illustrate the manuscript's primary focus, making them a reliable indicator for inclusion in the derivation graph.\nA derivation is defined as to originate, develop, or be obtained from another object. In this context, a derivation graph is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the set vertices represent the labeled key math equations and the set of edges represents the derivation relationships between equations, as seen in Figure 1. Specifically, a directed edge from node i to node j indicates that equation j is derived, as defined above, from node i.\""}, {"title": "3 Dataset", "content": "To facilitate our investigation into the extraction of mathematical relationships using derivation graphs, we developed a hand-labeled corpus,2 randomly sampled from the arXMLiv dataset (arXiv,"}]}

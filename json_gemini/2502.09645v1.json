A common paradigm is to map image or visual features to text or language representations, either by learning a shared feature space between the two modalities [1, 2] or by aligning one modality with the other [3, 4]. While pre-training with vast amounts of paired data has led to emergent capabilities, complex prompts that require compositional understanding still remain a challenge for state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models.\nAmong the more complex linguistic constructs, negations constitute a crucial phenomenon that varies widely across languages. Negations convey the absence, denial, or contradiction of a statement or action [5]. Existing research indicates that negations within prompts frequently evade foundational models during various semantic tasks [6-9]. Language models, even those with robust syntactic and semantic capabilities, struggle with negations in neural translation [10] and fill-in-the-blank tasks [11]. However, comprehending negations, though challenging for learning-based models [12], is essential for commonsense reasoning [13, 14] and highly desirable in image-text retrieval [9] and text-to-image generation settings [15], both of which rely on multimodal foundation models. Inaccurate handling of negation in these contexts can lead to significant real-world consequences, such as misinformation in chatbot responses,"}, {"title": "Related Work:", "content": "Negation poses a significant challenge across various domains, ranging from psycholinguistics to multimodal foundation models. Psycholinguistic studies have demonstrated the cognitive complexity of negation processing, including the role of working memory, attention, and inhibitory processes. These foundational insights are informing recent advancements in NLP, VLMs, and multimodal frameworks. We now present a brief overview of the literature in this domain, focusing on psycholinguistic studies, negation understanding in language models, and its implications for multimodal and audio foundation models.\nPsycholinguistic Studies on Processing Negations - Research on LLM evaluation is partly inspired by psycholinguistic studies [21] exploring how humans process words contextually. Some investigations have used EEG signals to understand human reactions to language stimuli [22]. Although humans acquire familiarity with negation early in life [23], negative sentences generally demand more cognitive effort than affirmative ones [24, 25]. Notably, the polarity of a statement (affirmative or negative) interacts with its truth value (true or false); while verifying true affirmatives is straightforward, verifying true negatives is found to be more difficult [26].\nPsycholinguists propose composite and interpretive theories to explain negative comprehension [27]. Composite theories posit that negated concepts are a combination of parts and are processed in a two-step process focusing first on the argument and then on its negation, whereas interpretive theories use truth-functional meanings to infer context-specific conclusions. Researchers have observed that vision-language tasks (e.g., sentence-picture verification) often mirror this two-step approach. Hence, one potential solution to improving negation understanding is to provide models with more \"time to think,\" using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting [28] and PAUSE tokens [29] during training. However, these methods alone do not guarantee a generalizable grasp of negations; in-depth benchmarking is necessary to evaluate true reasoning capabilities.\nNegation Understanding in LLMs: Despite their impressive syntactic and semantic capabilities, various studies have shown that LLMs struggle to interpret negations when tested on well-crafted benchmarks for natural language inference tasks [30]. Foundation models, extensively pretrained on unlabeled text, often fail to assign contrasting labels to affirmative and negative statements. Larger models seem to be more insensitive to negations, however, instruction tuning can lead to better outcomes. They"}, {"title": "Grasping Negations in Vision-Language Contexts:", "content": "In multimodal training scenarios, such as vision-language alignment, the inclusion of visual information offers additional context. However, the fundamental limitations in language understanding persist. Contrastive learning methods, including CLIP [1], can misinterpret negations by treating visual concepts in isolation rather than capturing their relational semantics [31]. In one of the early works, negation-aware video retrieval was addressed by repurposing existing datasets and introducing a novel training approach. This work demonstrated a significant enhancement in models' ability to handle negated natural-language queries, leading to improved performance on standard benchmarks [32]. More recently, Patel et al. [9] introduce TripletCLIP, a multimodal framework that enhances the understanding and representation of negation by leveraging triplet-based contrastive learning to better align textual and visual modalities. However, there is still a pressing need for more robust approaches that integrate negation-specific reasoning and representation particularly for tasks where recognizing the absence of an object (e.g., \"not present\" or \"excluded\") is just as critical as identifying its presence."}, {"title": "Negations in Audio Foundation Models:", "content": "Despite significant advancements in audio foundation models, as evidenced by recent works [33-36], negation remains largely unexplored. Effective negation interpretation is crucial across various applications, including speech recognition, translation, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI. For example, in multilingual speech recognition, accurately interpreting negations like \"not\" in phrases such as \"I am not going\" across diverse languages is essential for achieving correct transcriptions. In the domain of speech translation, mistranslating negations such as \"I don't like it\" can lead to unintended consequences. Moreover, within the context of multilingual conversational AI, precise negation interpretation is indispensable for comprehending user intent and formulating appropriate responses, particularly within intricate, multi-turn dialogues. An interesting example would be a virtual assistant that must accurately interpret a user's request like \"Don't book the flight,\" irrespective of the language spoken. However, processing negation in audio data presents a unique set of challenges, encompassing variations in prosody, intonation, acoustic ambiguity, and contextual cues across different languages."}, {"title": "Contributions:", "content": "In this perspective, we address two crucial priorities for improving multimodal foundation models. First, we emphasize the urgent need to understand how these models interpret and manage negation across a variety of languages globally, acknowledging that many existing methods overlook important linguistic and cultural distinctions. Second, we propose a taxonomy of negation constructs that can impact multimodal foundation models. Furthermore, we advocate for the development of specialized benchmarks to rigorously measure a model's ability to handle"}, {"title": "2 Taxonomy of Diversity in Negations", "content": "Developing a clear and comprehensive taxonomy of negation across languages is crucial for identifying the specific challenges that diverse negation forms pose to multilingual multimodal foundation models, which must interpret and generate content across various modalities, including text, image, audio, and video. By systematically categorizing these negation types, researchers can devise targeted benchmarks that rigorously evaluate a model's capacity to handle subtle linguistic nuances. Moreover, a well-defined taxonomy provides a structured basis for refining both model training and evaluation methodologies, enabling practitioners to incorporate more sophisticated negation instances into datasets, metrics, and diagnostic tools. This, in turn, empowers models to navigate the complexities of negation across the diverse linguistic landscape. Building upon the cross-linguistic typology of negation [19], as shown in Fig. 2, we propose a taxonomy of negation for foundation models, grouping them into four overarching categories: (i) Syntactic Negations, (ii) Morphological Negations, (iii) Lexical and Semantic Negations, and (iv) Prosodic, Paralinguistic, and Pragmatic Negation. Each of these categories addresses distinct linguistic dimensions of negation and presents its own set of research opportunities in foundation models. Next, we illustrate sixteen representative negation sub-types-ranging from standard (sentential) negation to non-verbal forms.\n1. Syntactic Negations: This category encompasses negations formed by adjusting a sentence's structure to convey a negative meaning. Languages achieve this through methods such as inserting negation particles, introducing specialized words, or rearranging existing syntactic elements. Because the negative sense arises from each language's core grammar, these approaches can vary dramatically across linguistic contexts, reflecting diverse rules and usage patterns. Within syntactic negations, several subtypes emerge each employing distinct structural strategies to express negation.\n\u2022 Standard (Sentential) Negation: It is the most common form of negation. It typically involves a negation particle or word added to the sentence to indicate a negative meaning. In English, for instance, negation is usually marked by the word \"not,\" as in the sentence I am not going. Many languages follow a similar pattern, though"}, {"title": "Morphological Negation:", "content": "In this category, languages express negation by attaching affixes such as prefixes or suffixes to a word, rather than using standalone negation particles. This approach integrates negation directly into the word's structure, allowing for more compact expressions. This can also enhance communication efficiency and clarity, allowing text within VLMs to convey negation in a more integrated and seamless manner. Within morphological negation, we distinguish two main subtypes:\n\u2022 Affixal Negation: Many languages express negation through morphological processes on verbs or other word classes. For example, in Turkish, the negation suffix -me is added to verbs to create a negative meaning, as in Gitme (Don't go). While this method is succinct, it demands that models recognize how affixes operate across diverse linguistic systems-particularly in languages with complex morphology that may diverge from the syntax-driven structures commonly seen in English.\n\u2022 Negative Prefixes: This subtype involves the use of prefixes attached to the beginning of a word to indicate negation. In English, common negative prefixes include un-, in-, dis-, and non-, as seen in words like uncertain, incomplete, dislike, and nonexistent. German also employs negative prefixes such as un-, as in unm\u00f6glich (impossible). Although these constructions are typically straightforward, they can introduce ambiguity-especially when multiple prefixes share similar spellings but hold different meanings, or when context alters their significance. Recognizing and correctly interpreting these prefixes remains a key challenge in multilingual and morphologically rich environments."}, {"title": "3. Lexical and Semantic Negation:", "content": "This category embeds negation within specific words or relies on the inherent semantic properties of certain lexical items. Unlike syntactic negations, which modify sentence structure, lexical and semantic negations operate at the word level. This approach allows for more nuanced and compact expressions of negation. Understanding this category is vital to capturing how negation emerges from a language's lexicon and semantics, rather than from explicit grammatical constructions. Within lexical and semantic negations, we identify three distinct subtypes, each posing unique challenges for multilingual foundation models.\n\u2022 Negative Pronouns and Determiners: Certain languages possess dedicated pronouns or determiners that inherently convey negative meanings, eliminating the need for separate negation particles. For example, in English, pronouns such as nobody and nothing intrinsically negate the subject or object of a sentence, as seen in Nobody came to the party or I have nothing to say. Similarly, German utilizes the negative determiner kein, as in Ich habe kein Geld (I have no money), to directly negate the noun it precedes. While these forms enable concise negation, they demand that models recognize and interpret inherently negative words in various contexts, rather than simply relying on standalone negation markers.\n\u2022 Lexical Negation: This subtype encompasses specific words that inherently carry negative meanings without requiring additional negation particles or morphological alterations. Examples in English include words like absent (instead of \"not present\") and unavailable (instead of \"not available\"). Such negations are embedded within the lexical semantics of these words, meaning they do not always display overt syntactic markers. Consequently, models must develop a deeper understanding of word semantics and the ability to identify negative meanings embedded within individual lexical items, necessitating more sophisticated training approaches that go beyond surface-level negation detection.\n\u2022 Negative Polarity Items (NPIs): These are words or phrases permissible only in negative contexts. In English, for example, the word ever in I haven't ever seen that qualifies as an NPI. Similarly, in Hindi, the word kabhi functions as an NPI, appearing in negative sentences like Mai kabhi nahi gaya (I never went). For models to correctly identify NPIs, they must not only detect negation but also recognize the specific lexical elements that depend on it for grammatical validity. The variation of NPIs across languages adds yet another layer of complexity for multilingual systems."}, {"title": "4. Prosodic, Paralinguistic, and Pragmatic Negation:", "content": "Certain languages convey negation primarily through context, intonation, gestures, or dialectal usage, employing both prosodic and paralinguistic features to express denial or contradiction. These non-verbal and pragmatic forms of negation in audio and video modalities often defy standardized linguistic rules and grammatical structures, posing unique challenges for automated systems that typically rely on text-based cues. This category encompasses negation conveyed through sound patterns, such as variations in pitch, tone, rhythm, and stress, as well as non-verbal auditory cues like gestures and facial expressions. Understanding these nuanced forms of negation is crucial for developing multimodal foundation models capable of accurately interpreting negated statements in both audio and video contexts, ensuring reliable performance across diverse linguistic and cultural settings. There are three subtypes that exemplify this category's richness:\n\u2022 Non-verbal Negation: In some cultural and linguistic traditions, negation is expressed through non-verbal means, such as head shakes, specific hand gestures,"}, {"title": "3 Research Challenges and Opportunities", "content": "As shown in Figure 3, multilingual multimodal foundation models face significant challenges due to the diverse ways negations are expressed across languages, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality training data containing a wide range of negated expressions. The human tendency to focus predominantly on positive information further exacerbates this issue, leading to an underrepresentation of negated concepts in existing datasets. While standard negation in English, such as using \"not,\" may appear straightforward, languages like French and Turkish employ structures such as double negation or affixal negation, which can confuse models unfamiliar with these patterns. Negative concord, where multiple negative markers collectively express a single negation, poses particular difficulties in multilingual tasks, as foundation models"}, {"title": "4 Discussion and Future Directions", "content": "Initial efforts in advancing negation understanding have been encouraging, exemplified by datasets like NeQA [37], This-is-not-a-Dataset [30], SugarCrepe [7], CC-Neg [8], and studies on bias in Indic languages [38]. Moreover, research has shown promise in various domains, including the medical and legal fields [17, 18]. However, these advances only begin to address the multifaceted nature of negation across diverse linguistic and multimodal contexts. We posit that future research should integrate specialized negation benchmarks and architectural-level enhancements, such as language-specific strategies, specialized attention mechanisms, and multimodal hybrid architectures, to more comprehensively capture and interpret negation.\nSpecialized Negation Benchmarks: Establishing dedicated benchmarks for negation-specific constructs across monolingual, multilingual, unimodal, and multimodal foundation model settings is crucial to enhancing negation handling in large foundation models. These benchmarks should capture the full linguistic diversity of negation forms, ranging from double negation and negative concord to affixal negation and non-verbal cues, thereby assessing how models interpret and integrate negation across different languages and modalities. To facilitate fair comparisons, key evaluation metrics must be standardized while encompassing a wide range of language families, dialects, and cultural contexts. Furthermore, incorporating tasks that mirror real-world applications such as text-to-image retrieval, audio-based question answering, unimodal text generation, and multilingual content understanding-enables a more practical and comprehensive assessment of model performance in complex and varied scenarios. By developing such specialized benchmarks, researchers can systematically evaluate and improve the ability of foundation models to comprehend and handle negation, ensuring their reliability and effectiveness across diverse linguistic and multimodal environments.\nIntegrative Architectural Approaches for Negation: To enhance the understanding of negation in multimodal foundation models, several architectural advancements are essential. Language-specific tokenization and preprocessing [39, 40] play a pivotal role by ensuring that critical negation markers are accurately captured across diverse linguistic variations. By introducing targeted tokenization schemes tailored to specific languages, models can better recognize negation structures such as negative concord, double negation, and unique morphological markers, especially when supported by a comprehensive multilingual corpus. Complementing this, the incorporation of fine-grained attention mechanisms [41] dedicated to detecting and resolving the scope of negation can significantly boost model performance. These specialized attention networks focus on specific sentence segments where negation occurs, effectively"}]}

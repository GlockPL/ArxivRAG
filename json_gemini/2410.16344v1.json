One of the earliest comprehensive overviews of this field was provided by Biamonte et al. [5], who introduced the fundamental concepts of quantum information and discussed how quantum computing could address complex learning tasks. Their work laid the foundation for exploring how quantum states and quantum algorithms could be used to process data in ways classical systems cannot, thereby inspiring the integration of quantum circuits with traditional machine learning models.\nBuilding on this, Schuld and Killoran [6] demonstrated the utility of quantum circuits in hybrid models, where quantum circuits are employed for feature encoding and data transformation, followed by classical neural networks for classification. These quantum circuits, often termed quantum neural networks (QNNs), utilize quantum entanglement and superposition to enhance feature extraction. The potential of such hybrid quantum-classical models is highly relevant to our approach, as we also employ a quantum circuit to encode classical features using angle embedding, which is later processed by a classical neural network.\nIn addition to this, Schuld and Petruccione [3] provided a comprehensive introduction to quantum machine learning, outlining how quantum algorithms could be adapted to existing machine learning frameworks. Their work extensively explored the interaction between quantum computing and classical learning models, further supporting the development of hybrid quantum-classical approaches like ours. The integration of quantum circuits for feature encoding in hybrid architectures is a direct extension of the principles laid out in their research.\nHavl\u00ed\u010dek et al.

They demonstrated that quantum feature maps could be used in supervised learning tasks to achieve a quantum advantage, even on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Their work showed that quantum models could outperform classical models in specific tasks by mapping input data into high-dimensional quantum states. This principle directly informs our work, as our Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) model also leverages quantum feature encoding via a 4-qubit circuit to capture complex, non-linear relationships within the Iris dataset.\nSeveral works have focused on integrating quantum circuits with classical neural networks to form hybrid architectures, each exploiting the strengths of both quantum and classical paradigms.

The entanglement process is a quintessential quantum phenomenon that enables qubits to interlink their information content, allowing for the representation of non-linear relationships between features that classical systems cannot achieve. In our design, we introduce circular entanglement through controlled-Z (CZ) gates, which connect adjacent qubits and enhance the interactivity among them:\nEntanglement Layer: $\\prod_{i=1}^{3} CZ(q_i, q_{i+1})$\nAlso, we are connecting the last qubit to the first qubit to make it a circular entaglement. Without connecting the first and last qubits, the entanglement is limited to nearest-neighbor interactions, where only adjacent qubits are linked. This entanglement structure ensures that all qubits are interconnected, fostering greater expressiveness within the quantum layer and enabling the model to learn intricate relationships among the encoded features.\nThe architecture of our quantum circuit consists of two primary layers. The first layer applies parameterized single-qubit rotations, focusing on extracting feature-specific information, while the second layer implements the entanglement operations through CZ gates.

This quick increase in accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the quantum feature extraction, which helped the classical network learn significant patterns early in the training process. By the fifth epoch, the model achieved 93.33% accuracy, reflecting consistent improvements.\nA notable aspect of the training was the model's ability to converge smoothly. By epoch 16, the model reached a perfect test accuracy of 100%, and this accuracy remained stable through the subsequent epochs. The rapid convergence indicates that the hybrid quantum-classical architecture not only efficiently captured the essential features of the dataset but also ensured optimal generalization to unseen data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.\nThe role of the quantum layer in enhancing feature extraction became more evident as the test loss consistently decreased across epochs. Beginning with a test loss of 0.0348 in the first epoch, the model managed to reduce the loss to 0.0053 by the final epoch.

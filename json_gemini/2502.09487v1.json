Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase an excellent level of response consistency across wide-ranging contexts (prompts). We leverage these parallels to establish a framework for quantifying mental states. Our approach utilises self-report questionnaires that reliably assess these states due to their inherent sensitivity to patterns of co-occurring responses. Specifically, we recruited a large sample of participants (N=422) to investigate how well an LLM (Mistral-7B-OpenOrca) quantifies a heterogenous set of depressive mood states measured with participants' open-ended responses to a depression questionnaire. We show LLM responses to held-out multiple-choice questions, given participants' open-ended answers, correlate strongly (r: 0.52-0.84) with true questionnaire scores, demonstrating LLM's generalisation from mood representations. We explore a link between these representations and factor analysis. Using ridge regression, we find depression-related subspaces within LLM hidden states. We show these subspaces to be predictive of participants' \"Depression\" and \"Somatic & Emotional Distress\" factor scores, as well as suicidality severity. Overall, LLMs can provide quantitative measures of mental states. The reliability of these hinges upon how informative the questions we ask participants are. Used correctly, this approach could supplement mental state assessment in a variety of settings.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Moods, emotions, and mental states more broadly, are fascinating. They guide us in major life decisions such as buying a house, choosing a partner or a career path. On the other hand, they influence our thoughts and cognition. For example, feeling joyful and happy may promote positive thinking: \"I was great today\", \"I think they like me\". Conversely, feeling depressed, worthless and suicidal may constrain the space of thoughts a person entertains to ones such as: \"Life is not worth living\", \"I am to blame for this\". In extreme cases, this may lead someone to engage in suicidal behaviours a global issue resulting in premature deaths at a rate of 700,000 a year. Unfortunately, research to-date has mainly focused on understanding the algorithmic thought processes governing how people solve hierarchical planning problems or simple risky decision-making tasks. While some attempted to spell out the effects mood may have on such processes, these approaches are still limited in explaining the intricacies of thought and their mechanisms in psychopathology. \u03a4\u03bf shed light onto this problem, we take a novel research avenue that ties closely with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). Notably, state-of-the-art LLM-based systems have demonstrated a striking similarity between how they consistently generate language and converse in response to a set of prompts and how humans communicate, think, and report mental states using language. Interestingly, LLMs provide a promising model of neural activity during language generation, story listening and internal speech generation and offer means of stimulus design to drive specific neural activity. By virtue of the parallels between the human mental state consistency and LLM context consistency, a fundamental question arises. What is the nature of this correspondence and can we leverage our understanding thereof to model psychological processes, such as thought, both in health and psychopathology?"}, {"title": "Problem statement and related work", "content": "We take the first step towards understanding and leveraging the apparent parallels between LLMs and human mental states and ask whether an LLM can be used to quantify human depressive mood states, maintaining consistency of responses given a mood state. We examine this by turning to standardised self-report psychiatric questionnaires. These questionnaires deal with agreed-upon constructs (e.g. depression, anxiety, apathy), and are widely used to aid clinical diagnosis due to their specificity and sensitivity. Such questionnaires are highly sensitive to context, whereby individuals with diverse mental states (acting as context) provide sets of responses consistent with these mental states. Importantly, the way people respond to the questions reveals relevant structure, with certain responses co-occurring together and thereby pointing at an underlying relationship between thoughts tied together by an emotional state. For example, answering \"I feel hopeless about the future\" tends to co-occur participants answering \"I feel that I am neither useful nor needed\". This co-occurrence highlights two important aspects: 1) Given a depressed mental state, people tend to report statements consistent with this state; 2) Given a statement expressing hopelessness, a statement expressing irrelevance is likely to follow. While seemingly obvious, the second observation in combination with LLMs' promising predictive utility in cognitive science, may offer a powerful approach to objective quantification of human mental states, including psychopathology.\nOften, self-report questionnaires employ multiple-choice scales. This approach constrains mental state representations to patterns of responses (scores), precluding predictions in high-dimensional settings (everyday thinking, behaviour, neural activity, treatment). To overcome this, we extend the standard self-report questionnairesto have an open-ended form, retaining both the important structure of such questionnaires but also allowing for a richer sample from participants' dimensions of mental state that can then be represented in an LLM space.\nNotably, there is an existing body of work, showcasing the capability of LLMs to represent human-like personality profiles, as well as mental states relating to psychopathology and more broadly. As a result, different criteria have been established for using psychological tests on LLMs, including questionnaire scales. What emerges is a broad consistency of LLMs across psychological measurements, justifying our approach. We believe our contribution is novel, as we go beyond the focus on whether LLMs demonstrate something like a psychology. In contrast, we leverage this apparent ability to then quantify and model human depressive states. To our knowledge, this approach has only been explored in a limited capacity to extract sentiment of open-ended questionnaire responses to predict depression severity. Given the promising demonstration of LLMs psychology, we take the idea of open-ended responses as samples from participants' mental states further. We recruit participants to provide responses to open-ended depression questionnaires and investigate how well an LLM quantifies a diverse set of depressive mood states. We use participants' additional multiple-choice responses to such questionnaires as validation metrics. Crucially, we evaluate whether LLM representations of said mood states generalise, allowing to make predictions across held-out questionnaires responses. Lastly, we showcase an exploration of LLM hidden states to capture a latent structure relevant to depression and find it predictive of severity in different mood state dimensions, including suicidality."}, {"title": "Study design", "content": "We recruited N=422 fluent English speakers (mean age 37\u00b112 years, 216 females) with diverse depression severity (see distributions in Appendix A.4) on Prolific. The study was approved by UCL's Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 16639/001). Participants provided consent and were reimbursed \u00a38.21/h. See more details in Appendix A.\nParticipants' main task was to provide writtenresponses to open-ended questions that we derived from the multiple-choice depression Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). We created three levels of open-ended questions of increasing specificity, each containing one, three and eight questions, respectively, that corresponded to the original PHQ-9 questions. Broadly, the questions target participants': \"Overall wellbeing\", \"Interest and pleasure in activities\", \"Mood and feelings\", \"Sleep\", \"Energy levels\", \"Appetite\", \"Self-worth\", \"Focus\", \"Slowness/restlessness\" (see Appendix B for the exact phrasing of the questions - note that we removed the suicidality Question 9). At each level, participants had 1.5 minutes to answer each open-ended question with a written response of at least 30 words. Following a set of open-ended questions at Level 1 and 2, we asked participants to respond on a scale (Very Bad, Bad, Good, Very Good) to answer \"Please select a response to the following statement that best describes you over the last 2 weeks\" regarding a statement that was phrased similarly to the corresponding open-ended question (see the exact phrasing in Appendix C). After Level 3 open-ended questions, participants completed the standard PHQ-9 questionnaire, as well as two additional questionnaires assessing anxiety - Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) - and depression - Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). At the very end of the study, we asked participants to again answer the open-ended Question 1 at Level 2.\nWe used Mistral-7B-OpenOrca (MistralO) LLM for the analyses (see details in Appendix G). We report Spearman's rank correlations and Bonferroni p-values (defaulting to 5%-a level), unless otherwise stated."}, {"title": "Results", "content": null}, {"title": "Item-level sampling", "content": "Firstly, we show we can use MistralO to predict item-level multiple-choice question scores given participants' item-level open-ended responses.\nFor each participant, at each level, we create a set of item-level prompts, where a prompt consists of: a QA-pair (open-ended question and participant's open-ended answer), as well as the corresponding multiple-choice question (see an example in Appendix D). We then perform a forward pass using MistralO, for each of participant's QA-pair and multiple-choice question to sample a response 50 times. See an illustration of this process in Figure 1B. We instruct the model to answer using the questionnaire scale. In the following, we average across the samples for each QA-pair response.\nIn Figure 2, for each level and each question we plot subject's score on the multiple choice question against MistralO predicted score to the same question, given participant's QA-pair. Overall, MistralO scores for each question given participants' corresponding QA-pair as context are highly correlated with the true participants' scores (0.52 \u2013 0.84). This indicates that MistralO is able to represent the sample from participant's mental state (in the form of open-ended responses) to then provide expected responses on the multiple-choice question. This finding emphasises the ability of the model to provide consistent responses across a diverse set of mood states in a human population. Furthermore, we observe a significant level of variability of MistralO responses, particularly when participants report a lack of the symptom in a given Level 3 question (\"Not at all\" answer for multiple-choice PHQ-9 questions). This may indicate that the content of participant's answer doesn't give the model enough evidence to claim the lack of a symptom given that participants don't explicitly state they are not bothered by something. We also notice that overall model responses are biased towards higher scores, which may be a result of an inherent bias from the model's initial training dataset.\nOverall, MistralO quantifies mood states of participants as expressed through the QA-pairs. We validated this by comparing item-level score predictions to true participant scores. While the model may be biased towards providing more 'depressed' answers, the clear trend of score severity is a promising sign that the requisite consistency, indicative of mental state, is represented."}, {"title": "Item-level generalisation sampling", "content": "Next, we evaluate MistralO's response generalisation to multiple-choice questions beyond those implied by QA-pairs. We show we can predict item-level scores to other depression (SDS) and anxiety (GAD-7) questionnaires using Level 3 QA-pairs.\nWe create a new set of item-level prompts, where a prompt consists of: one of participant's eight Level 3 QA-pairs and one of all of the multiple-choice questions from the SDS, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 questionnaires. Here, we evaluate how well MistralO is able to recover multiple-choice scores given each of the Level 3 QA-pairs (mental state samples in a specific dimension). We pass each of the participant's QA-pair question prompt through MistralO in order to sample and then average across 20 responses to the multiple-choice question.\nAdditionally, in Equation 1, we approximate MistralO's total score (overall symptom severity) for each of the sampled self-report questionnaire, j, by summing up scores, $s_{q_j,c}$, across questionnaire items, {qj}, for each of the Level 3 QA-pairs as context, c, and then averaging across them.\n$\\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{c=1}^{C}\\frac{1}{Q_j}\\sum_{q_j=1}^{Q_j} s_{q_j,c}$     (1)\nIn Figure 3 (first column), we plot participants' total scores for each questionnaire (SDS, GAD-7, PHQ-9) against MistralO estimated total score. While the model captures the expected trend in total scores (Pearson's correlation 0.73-0.85), we observe a bias towards higher scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 in contrast with the true participant's total scores. Interestingly, for the SDS questionnaire, the bias appears to go in the opposite direction in the higher range of total scores, where participant's total scores are higher than MistralO's predictions.\nAt the item-level view, we plot the correlations between participants' scores for each PHQ-9 question and each question from SDS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 (second column). We use this as a benchmark questionnaire response structure that participants demonstrate and compare with the correlations between the true item score on each of SDS, GAD-7, PHQ-9 questionnaires (x-axis) and MistralO recovered score for that question given each of the Level 3 open-ended QA-pairs (y-axis). We observe that the covariance structure between PHQ-9 and generalisation questionnaire scores (column 2) match some of the block structure of the correlation map between the true generalisation questionnaire scores and Mistral0 recovered scores (column 3) from the corresponding mental state description.\nThese results are promising and indicate MistralO represents a short open-ended mental state report derived from PHQ-9 items sufficiently to generalise from this state to respond to other depression and anxiety questions in a manner reflecting the true underlying mental structure. This further indicates MistralO's ability to encode a consistent representation akin to a mental state resulting in expected responses. Importantly, these consistencies are seen both at an item and questionnaire level."}, {"title": "Predicting SDS factor scores with ridge regression from hidden states", "content": "Next, we show that can we characterise a latent structure within LLM's hidden state representations of participants' QA-pairs to predict participant's severity on latent dimensions derived from SDS depression questionnaire scores (factor scores)."}, {"title": "SDS factor analysis", "content": "We make use of factor analysis, which allows to characterise the co-occurrences of responses across a questionnaire. Factor analyses assumes a latent space that represents cognitive-behavioural dimensions represented by weighted combinations of questions. The coordinates within this latent space (expressing severity within each dimension) are expressed as factor scores.\nTo calculate SDS factor scores for each participant, we assume a four factor model with a promax rotation for the SDS responses. At this stage, we are interested in examining the patterns between an assumed participant (rather than best-fitting one) and LLM-represented structure. We use SDS responses from all participants to fit the factor analysis model.\nWe find the following factors that consist of questions with highest loading for each - 1) Depression: Hopelessness & Apathy; 2) Somatic & Emotional Distress; 3 Cognitive Functioning; 4) Appetite & Weight Changes. See Appendix E for the content of each factor and the factor loading matrix.\nThe first two factors are well represented loading onto the majority of the questions, while Factor 3 and 4 are less defined. This may be because Factor 3 overlaps with Factor 1 as reflected by the loadings and the co-occurrence of Factor 3 questions with other questions in the covariance matrix (see Figure 15A in Appendix E), while the \"Appetite & Weight Changes\" factor consists of two questions, which don't co-vary with other questions.\nTo see the relationship between factor scores and multiple-choice questions at each level, we calculate and plot (Figure 4 top) pairwise correlations between each factor score and each multiple-"}, {"title": "All questions average representation", "content": "We are interested in establishing whether MistralO is able to sufficiently represent participant's mental state using all of the QA-pairs to be able to generalise to SDS factor scores. To that end, we extract MistralO hidden states at every 3rd layer for the last token of each open QA-pair and calculate the average hidden state, representing participant's overall mental state. We then split participants data into train and test set (75%/25%; n = 283/97 after applying exclusion criteria). To find the most informative subspace, we reduce the dimensionality of train-set participants' average hidden state using PCA with 221 features (explaining 95% variance). We then fit a ridge regression model, to predict participants' factor scores from these representations.\nUsing the train set, we ran 20-fold leave-one-out cross validation of the ridge regression to find the best regularisation strength, a, from 20 values on the log-scale between [10-2, 102] and the best layer. We find layer 17 and a = 3.360 provide the highest overall R2. We use this parametrisation to predict factor scores on the held-out test set. For each predicted factor score, for each participant we plot the true value and calculate the correlation in Figure 4 (middle).\nThe model is able to predict factor scores for Factor 1 and 2 quite well (as measured with correlation between true and predicted factor scores). This suggest that the internal states of the model encode the requisite representations indicative of the factor space related to depression. The remaining factors are less well captured, which may indicate the limitations of these under-defined factors.\nWe aim to quantify how individual QA-pair (with respect to the average representation) contributes to the factor score prediction.

In essence, we provide MistralO with a complete mental state to predict responses given LLM representations of those states.\nWe provide all the Level 3 QA-pairs in order (cumulative), append a PHQ-9 question and sample MistralO's response one by one, appending each as we go. We obtain 50 samples from the model for each question, which we then average across.\nIn Figure 5A, we plot participants' PHQ-9 total scores (overall depression severity) vs. MistralO's PHQ-9 total scores given a full set of cumulative Level 3 QA-pairs. We report a strong correlation between the total scores (r = 0.844), as well as a correction of the bias we observed when estimating total scores from item-level QA-pairs before.\nIn Figure 5B-J, we plot item-level predictions against true scores for each PHQ-9 question given a full set of participants' Level 3 QA-pairs. We observe an overall improvement in predicting item-level scores. Importantly, we observe less bias toward negative scores, especially in the no symptom response, indicating item-level de-biasing. Both total and item-level results indicate that providing a full set of QA-pairs leads to a richer representation of participant's mental state, allowing the model to make more accurate predictions.\nNotably, the model showed good prediction of suicidality scores (Question 9, r = 0.547). Given this, we wondered whether we can skip the costly"}, {"title": "Discussion and conclusion", "content": "We explored whether an LLM (MistralO) can quantify diverse depressive mood states from open-ended responses to a depression questionnaire and generalise this quantification. Participants provided written answers to open-ended questions derived from the PHQ-9, and responses to standard multiple-choice questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7, SDS). LLM-predicted responses to multiple-choice questions, given the open-ended answers, correlated strongly (0.52-0.84) with participant scores, demonstrating LLM's ability to represent mental states from open-ended descriptions, albeit with a bias towards \"depressed\" scores. Furthermore, MistralO generalised from open-ended responses to predict scores on other questionnaires (GAD-7, SDS), capturing trends in total scores and reproducing some of the covariance structure between questionnaires. The study demonstrated promise in predicting certain factors scores (e.g., \"Depression: Hopelessness & Apathy,\" \"Somatic & Emotional Distress\") from the model hidden state representations of open-ended responses, suggesting that these representations contain information about the underlying mental state dimensions. Lastly, we showed that providing the model with a full-set of participants' open-ended responses to represent their mental state improves model performance compared with item-level representations and corrects the severity bias. Importantly, we were able to predict suicidality scores both by sampling responses and by reading it out from a hidden states subspace representing participant's mental state.\nTo further refine our understanding of the LLM\u2019s latent structure, our future work will explore applying supervised, low-dimensional Autoencoders, constrained with participants' true factor scores during training. This could provide a more constrained representation of the relevant dimensions of psychopathology. Importantly, we will then investigate perturbing the represented factor scores in a specific direction, thereby inducing targeted changes in responses to questionnaires and beyond. This approach could offer a robust measure of mental states that we hope to evaluate as predictors of neural activity to semantically and emotionally rich naturalistic stories. It also stands as a precursor for an experimental stimulus design approach allowing us to create targeted semantic stimuli that drive the neural activity in the relevant mood-subspace.\nOverall, the research demonstrates the potential of LLMs to quantify and model human mood states from both structured questionnaire data and unstructured open-ended responses. The ability to generalise from one type of mood assessment (open-ended responses) to predict scores on other assessments (multiple-choice questionnaires) is promising and indicative of LLMs ability to represent relevant dimensions of mood states, as is further demonstrated by successfully utilising hidden state representations to predict factor scores and suicidality severity. The reliability of these results depends both on how informative the questions and the participant responses are. Nevertheless, if used correctly, this approach could supplement mental state assessment in the clinic and within scalable online platforms. Notably, this approach could help in identifying those at higher risk of suicide in situations where they may be reluctant to disclose suicidality."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "There are several limitation to our study. Firstly, we only focused on three self-report questionnaires (SDS, GAD-7, PHQ-9). We also used mental state descriptions based on a specific, structured PHQ-9 questionnaire. It's unclear how well the LLM would perform with other questionnaires and if the findings would generalise to other types of assessments. The limitation is further underlined by the findings that many of the depression questionnaires weakly overlap, threatening a consistent and generalisable measurement of depression severity. However, the LLM-based approach may offer a partial solution, as it could allow for a very rich representation of mental states given a sufficiently informative input, particularly if supplemented with neural activity representations.\nSecondly, we acknowledge that the quality and informativeness of open-ended responses may have varied across participants (especially the slow-typers) due to 1.5 minutes time-limit and a minimum 30-words requirement. We also didn't control for confounding variables such as current mood due to the most recent events, which may not be informative about a more persistent depressive state. Furthermore, we recruited a specific online population on Prolfic, selecting for those with depressive symptoms. Further analyses would have to be performed to establish whether LLMs are able to quantify other mental states across a diverse subsets of populations, including healthy controls as well as participants in lab environments.\nMoreover, in the factor-analysis approach, we assumed a specific model, which might not be optimal for our dataset. Finding the best-fitting factor analysis model, in combination with collecting a larger dataset to potentially better represent the under-defined factors 3 and 4, could alleviate some of these concerns and potentially allow drawing more meaningful conclusions about the mapping between hidden states and these factors. Future analyses will consider deriving a factor space from a combination of questionnaires, which might offer a more robust factor quantification.\nAdditionally, we performed our analysis using one LLM (Mistral-7B-OpenOrca. A replication using different models would ensure the generalisability of our approach, especially with smaller models that may be better positioned for researchers and clinicians to apply at scale.

The translation of our research could be applied as scale for example by integrating with mental health chatbots or with smartphone ambulatory data, helping as many as possible.\nWe also see potential future risks, when similar methods could be used to infer aspects of someone's mental state that they wish not to disclose. This is pertinent in the realm of vast social media data. Someone's mental state representations combined with robust methods of altering it to steer thoughts of behaviours may be hijacked by bad actors with goals of maximising profits at any cost. It is particularity important to put guardrails and regulations in place to prevent such activities, especially when we consider vulnerable populations being the target such as depressed individuals or gambling addicts. Equally, a potential risk arises in situations where employers, with access to employee's vast set of written communication, would be interested in predicting for example sick leave due to mental health reasons.

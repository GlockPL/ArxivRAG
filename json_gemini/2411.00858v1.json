The long-term disorderliness in\nglucose levels contributes to severe damage in diabetic patients' blood vessels [1].\nAs reported by World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is known as the\nseventh fatal disease. Recently, the essential changes in human beings' lifestyles\nhave led to arising various disorders, such as obesity/overweight, hypertension,\ndiabetes, and cancer [2].\nGenerally, diabetes is caused by some life-risk factors such as high body\nweight, inappropriate food style, sleeplessness, and chewing tobacco. In the short-\nterm, diabetes can lead to kidney failure, hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis [3].\nBesides, gangrene can be triggered by diabetic foot diseases. In the long term,\ndiabetes can lead to cardiac diseases, microvascular, and sightlessness [4]. Dia-\nbetes may even appear in children due to the lack of physical activity. Unfortu-\nnately, there are not any appropriate medicines for diabetes. However, managing\nit with suitable measures can lead to a healthy, long, and normal life [5].\nBased on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reports, the number\nof people who die from diabetes is dramatically high.

The Things layer includes different sensors and medical devices\nwhich are responsible for data collection. The edge layer comprises small and re-\nsource constraint end devices such as smartphones, smart bands, smart watches,\nand tablets. The fog layer includes devices such as laptops, desktop PCs, and\nworkstations, which are more powerful than edge layer devices. The cloud layer,\nincluding cloud data centers, has the capability of processing and storing big\ndata.\nThe general illustration of the system layers and phases is given in Figure 1.\nWe defined the AIOMT with these four layers, where the edge, fog, and cloud\nlayers are equipped with ML methods. Since edge and fog layers are close to the\nend devices, the processes can be conducted on them with less communication\ncost, less network traffic, less bandwidth usage, less power consumption.\nOur assumption is that the patients are provided with different relevant sen-\nsors and IoT devices to collect the needed data. In this architecture, the edge\nlayer is in charge of performing normalization and data cleaning the collected\ndata, then, transmitting them to suitable fog devices. The fog layer is respon-\nsible for conducting the rest of pre-processing procedure, including imbalance\nhandling and feature selection. In case the processing power is enough for ap-\nplying the classification algorithms on the data, they will be classified in the\nfog layer.

The aim of feature selection is to diminish the number\nof features and select an adequate number of features that lead to the best\npossible performance.

Meta-heuristic\nalgorithms are one of the popular and efficient methods for solving NP-hard\nproblems [16].\nIn this study, the BWO algorithm is adopted to attain an optimal solution\nfor the feature selection issue. The pseudo-code of adopted BWO is illustrated in\nAlgorithm 1. The BWO is an evolutionary algorithm imitating the strange habits\nof black widow spiders. Like other evolutionary algorithms, BWO is initiated by\na set of random potential solutions. The procreate phase is applied to the initial\nset and produces offspring for each pair.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Lyapunov optimization theory is a mathematical framework originating from Lyapunov drift theory [1], commonly studied in fields such as communication networks and control systems. It has been widely used in dynamic environments to stabilize and optimize queueing systems under stochastic conditions. For example, in wireless networks, bandwidth resources can be dynamically allocated based on the length of the data queue measured by a Lyapunov function, ensuring continuous data flow and maximizing throughput. In smart grids, elec-trical loads can be scheduled by minimizing the Lyapunov drift, thereby reducing energy consumption while guaranteeing power system stability [2]. The widespread application of Lya-punov optimization theory underscores its value in optimizing system performance in dynamic and uncertain environments.\nIn dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with limited power supply, UAVs must continuously adjust their positions and transmission power to match fluctuating channel conditions while managing long-term energy consumption constraints. These optimization decisions are further com-plicated by the need for computation offloading within the constraints of available computational resources. Additionally, the complexity intensifies in low-altitude economy (LAE) networking\u00b9, which supports a large number of UAVs while ensuring strict quality of service (QoS), security, and safety requirements. Therefore, Lyapunov optimization theory is de-sirable for LAE networks, as it enables the dual benefits of optimizing system performance and ensuring operational stability without requiring knowledge of future environmental information [3]. A substantial body of literature has explored methods for addressing the Lyapunov optimization problem, primarily focusing on traditional approaches such as convex optimization and heuristic algorithms. However, these conven-tional methods often face distinct challenges.\n\u2022 High Computational Complexity. Convex optimization methods rely on extensive computations, making it chal-lenging to meet the real-time decision-making require-ments in dynamic LAE networks. Additionally, Lya-punov optimization problems in high-dimensional LAE networks often involve non-convexity, rendering convex optimization methods ineffective.\n\u2022 Limited Generalizability. Heuristic algorithms are typ-ically designed based on specific problem features and are difficult to generalize across different environments, limiting their applicability in dynamic LAE networks. Furthermore, heuristic algorithms yield only sub-optimal solutions, without guaranteeing global optimality [4].\n\u2022 Dependency on Complete Information. Conventional methods require precise knowledge of the system state to formulate and solve the optimization problem. How-ever, such complete information is often unavailable in practical LAE networks, where channel conditions, user locations, and network demands change rapidly [5].\nSeveral works have explored learning-based methods, such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning, to address the Lyapunov optimization problem. For instance, supervised learning uses labeled data (system state-optimal decision pairs) to train neural networks, while reinforcement learning incorpo-rates the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function into its reward function, enabling agents to learn optimal policies through continuous interaction with the environment. However, these learning-based approaches also feature specific limitations below.\n\u2022 Reliance on High-Quality Annotated Data. Supervised learning requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, often necessitating expert strategies. In real-time LAE networks, covering a wide range of annotated data can be challenging, particularly in dynamic environments where annotations can quickly become invalid [6].\n\u2022 Difficulty in Balancing Exploration and Exploitation. Reinforcement learning improves policies through explo-ration; however, excessive exploration can lead to sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, excessive exploita-tion can result in short-sightedness, neglecting the long-term optimality of LAE networks [7].\nFortunately, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tech-niques, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and generative diffusion models (GDMs) offer promising solutions to address the aforemen-tioned challenges. For example, VAEs can compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent variables, sig-nificantly reducing computational complexity. GANs can pro-duce large amounts of high-quality synthetic data with specific labels. GDMs can improve the balance between exploration and exploitation by adjusting the number of denoising steps. Compared to conventional methods and traditional AI, the advantages of using GenAI to solve the Lyapunov optimization problem in LAE networks include the following:\n\u2022 Training Data Generation. Sudden extreme states, such as network congestion or abrupt channel deterioration, are critical points of instability in LAE networks. GenAI can generate corresponding synthetic data to minimize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function, thereby reducing the risk of instability during actual operations.\n\u2022 Latent Space Representation. GenAI can map high-dimensional LAE network states into a low-dimensional latent space. This transformation allows resource alloca-tion and control strategies that minimize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function to be identified more effi-ciently, thereby reducing computational burden.\n\u2022 Computational Efficiency. GenAI's ability to rapidly generate candidate strategies makes it computationally efficient for balancing Lyapunov drift and penalty terms in dynamic environments. This capability is critical for LAE networks, where real-time changes in network state demand a fast response to ensure stability.\nMotivated by these, this paper aims to provide a forward-looking exploration into the integration of GenAI and Lya-punov optimization theory for LAE network optimization. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We begin with an overview of Lyapunov optimization theory, examining the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches in ad-dressing Lyapunov optimization problems.\n\u2022 We then introduce various GenAI models and provide comprehensive analysis of their potential applications within the Lyapunov optimization theoretical framework.\n\u2022 Finally, we propose a novel Lyapunov-guided framework that integrates generative diffusion models with reinforce-ment learning, demonstrating its effectiveness through a case study of trajectory optimization and resource allocation in UAV-based LAE networks."}, {"title": "II. LYAPUNOV OPTIMIZATION THEORY: FROM CONVENTIONAL METHODS TO TRADITIONAL AI-ENABLED SOLUTIONS", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the fundamentals of Lya-punov optimization theory and provide a brief tutorial on its applications. We then discuss the use of conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled solutions for solving Lyapunov op-timization problems, highlighting their respective limitations."}, {"title": "A. Overview of Lyapunov Optimization Theory", "content": "1) What is Lyapunov optimization theory about: Lya-punov optimization theory is a powerful mathematical frame-work designed to solve dynamic stochastic optimization prob-lems. It decouples long-term stochastic optimization into se-quential per-slot deterministic sub-problems, providing theo-retical assurances for long-term system stability. Specifically, Lyapunov optimization theory uses a Lyapunov function to consolidate all relevant queues (i.e., long-term constraints) and employs Lyapunov drift to capture queue updates between consecutive time slots, thereby measuring system stability. The optimization objective is then defined as the penalty, effec-tively balancing system stability and performance. Finally, by minimizing the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function at each time slot, Lyapunov optimization theory achieves dual ben-efits of optimizing system performance and ensuring system stability without requiring future state information, making it particularly suitable for dynamic systems with uncertainty.\n2) How to use Lyapunov optimization theory: Assume a network has I queues ($Q_1(t), Q_2(t), . . ., Q_1(t)$), repre-senting metrics such as backlogged computation and energy consumption requests at time slot t, which indicate how well the long-term constraints have been satisfied in previ-ous slots. A Lyapunov function L(t) is then defined as a non-negative scalar that consolidates all relevant queues and measures their lengths. A typical quadratic Lyapunov function is $L(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{I} Q_i(t)^2$, which increases as the queueing system approaches instability."}, {"title": "B. Conventional Methods for Solving Lyapunov Optimization Problems", "content": "1) From the perspective of convex optimization: Convex optimization is a fundamental mathematical framework fo-cused on minimizing a convex objective function over convex sets, ensuring that any local optimum is guaranteed to be globally optimal. Since Lyapunov optimization problems are typically non-convex due to complex system dynamics and queue stability constraints, researchers employ several trans-formation techniques to convert these non-convex problems into tractable convex formulations. For example, as shown in Fig.1(a), the authors in [8] proposed a Lyapunov-based online control method, LYP-JRTO, to address the trajectory planning problem for solar-powered UAV networks. Specifically, LYP-JRTO employs the successive convex approximation (SCA) method to transform the UAV flight trajectory optimization problem into a sequence of convex, tractable problems that are solved iteratively until convergence.\n2) From the perspective of heuristic algorithms: Heuris-tic algorithms are problem-solving methods that find near-optimal solutions by mimicking evolutionary and collective intelligence processes from nature and society. For instance, particle swarm optimization simulates social behavior to move through the solution space and simulated annealing emulates thermal process to escape local optima. As shown in Fig.1(b), the authors in [9] proposed an online energy balancing strat-egy (OEBS) based on Lyapunov optimization for mobile crowdsensing. Specifically, OEBS employs a genetic algorithm where chromosomes (candidate solutions) form an initial pop-ulation; these chromosomes evolve through two operations: crossover (for generating improved solutions) and mutation (for escaping local optima), ultimately selecting the solution that minimizes the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function."}, {"title": "C. Traditional AI Solutions for Solving Lyapunov Optimization Problems", "content": "1) From the perspective of supervised learning: Super-vised learning is a foundational machine learning approach where models learn to map input features to output labels using a labeled training dataset. For Lyapunov optimization problems, supervised learning can be employed to learn the mapping between system states and optimal control deci-sions through training data comprising state-action pairs. As shown in Fig.1(c), the authors in [10] proposed LyDROO, a Lyapunov-guided deep learning approach for online compu-tation offloading in mobile edge computing networks. Specif-ically, LyDRO0 uses Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term problem into per-frame subproblems, each of which is solved by using deep learning, utilizing channel gains, system queue states, and offloading decisions as labeled input-output samples to update the neural network parameters.\n2) From the perspective of reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal decisions through environmental interac-tions to maximize cumulative rewards. In Lyapunov optimiza-tion problems, the agent makes decisions such as resource allocation and trajectory planning based on system states (e.g., queue lengths and channel conditions), receiving rewards derived from the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function, and updating its policy accordingly. As shown in Fig.1(d), the au-thors in [11] addressed the challenge of minimizing inference service delay in deep neural network tasks while maintain-ing long-term accuracy requirements. To this end, they first transformed a constrained Markov decision process (MDP) into an unconstrained MDP using Lyapunov optimization techniques. Subsequently, they developed a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm to optimize sampling rate adaptation and resource allocation without requiring future channel and data arrival information."}, {"title": "D. Implementation Insights", "content": "The exploration of conventional methods and traditional Al solutions for solving Lyapunov optimization problems has yielded several valuable insights and lessons.\n\u2022 Transformation Artifacts and Solution Suboptimality. Convex optimization methods require problem transfor-mations that increase dimensionality and may not pre-serve original problem properties, potentially compromis-ing solution quality.\n\u2022 Computational Cost and Lack of Convergence Guar-antees. Heuristic algorithms face high computational overhead, lack theoretical convergence guarantees, and show inconsistent performance due to parameter sensi-tivity.\n\u2022 Data Requirements and Adaptation Limitations. Su-pervised learning approaches depend heavily on compre-hensive training datasets and struggle to adapt to system changes post-training.\n\u2022 Training Efficiency and Stability Concerns. Reinforce-ment learning methods encounter stability challenges during exploration, require lengthy training periods, and face dimensionality issues in complex systems.\nThe aforementioned limitations underscore the inherent challenges of both conventional methods and AI-enabled ap-proaches in solving Lyapunov optimization problems, empha-sizing the need to explore more effective and comprehensive solutions to advance research in Lyapunov optimization."}, {"title": "III. GENERATIVE AI FOR SOLVING LYAPUNOV OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM", "content": "In this section, we first overview the advantages that GenAI models can provide to Lyapunov optimization theory, followed by the comprehensive analysis of representative GenAI mod-els and their potential contributions to advancing Lyapunov optimization."}, {"title": "A. Overview of Generative AI Models for Lyapunov Optimization Theory", "content": "GenAI has recently drawn significant attention for its un-precedented ability to automate the creation of diverse AI-generated content (AIGC), including text, audio, and im-ages. Unlike traditional AI models, which primarily focus on discriminative tasks, pattern recognition, and decision-making, GenAI excels at generating new content by learning the underlying patterns and distributions of training data to produce novel outputs.\nBeyond generating diverse digital content, GenAI models excel in solving optimization problems, thereby providing promising solutions to address the limitations and challenges presented in Section II-D. For instance, variational autoen-coders (VAEs) can compress high-dimensional states into low-dimensional latent variables, significantly reducing computa-tional complexity. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can generate substantial volumes of high-quality synthetic data with specific labels. Generative diffusion models (GDMs) can improve the balance between exploration and exploitation by adjusting the number of denoising steps."}, {"title": "B. Model-Specific Analysis: Working Principles and Optimization Benefits", "content": "1) Transformers: Transformers are a deep learning architecture based on the self-attention mech-anism, which has revolutionized natural language processing. By processing and weighing the importance of different parts of input sequences simultaneously, Transformers effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. They demonstrate exceptional performance across tasks, from language translation to text generation [12]. In Lyapunov optimization theory, Transformers leverage their self-attention mechanism to transform the processing of system states in Lyapunov optimization problems. Specifically, when handling complex system states-such as multiple queue lengths, channel conditions, and energy levels-the self-attention mechanism computes attention scores for each state component. Subse-quently, the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function is addressed based on these weighted states, effectively balancing drift reduction (system stability) and penalty minimization (perfor-mance optimization).\n2) Generative adversarial networks (GANs): GANs operate on a unique adversarial training principle in which two neural networks-a generator and a discriminator-compete to reach an equilibrium. The generator aims to create synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator attempts to differentiate between real and generated samples. GANs have proven particularly effective in image generation and data augmentation tasks [13]. In Lyapunov optimization theory, GANs introduce an ad-versarial optimization framework. Specifically, the generator network takes current system states and produces resource al-location and control decisions, while the discriminator network evaluates these decisions based on their Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function values. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce increasingly sophisticated strate-gies, and the discriminator aids in refining these strategies, effectively managing the trade-off between system stability and performance objectives.\n3) Variational autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs utilize autoencoders to learn compact and continuous latent representations of input data. Unlike tradi-tional autoencoders, VAEs impose a probabilistic structure on the latent space by encoding inputs into distributions rather than fixed points. Leveraging data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, VAEs enable the generation of new samples by sampling from the learned latent distribution [14]. VAEs contribute to Lyapunov optimization by mapping high-dimensional system states into a lower-dimensional latent space through an encoder network. This compressed repre-sentation captures both mean state estimates and associated uncertainties, enabling more robust optimization decisions. Meanwhile, the decoder network ensures that the latent rep-resentation retains sufficient information for accurate system state reconstruction, making the lower-dimensional optimiza-tion process more computationally efficient.\n4) Generative diffusion models (GDMs): GDMs represent a more recent advancement in GenAI, encompassing two intertwined processes: the forward process, which gradually introduces noise to the original data distribution until it resembles Gaussian noise, and the reverse process, which progressively removes noise to reconstruct the original data. GDMs have gained significant attention for their stable training dynamics and high-quality generation capabilities, particularly in image synthesis tasks [15]. GDMs offer a unique approach to Lyapunov optimization through their reverse process. Specifically, starting from a noisy initial policy, GDMs gradually remove noise to converge toward optimal solutions. This denoising process follows a carefully designed trajectory that helps avoid local optima-a com-mon challenge in Lyapunov optimization. This step-by-step approach not only enables more stable optimization paths but also provides an efficient way to explore the solution space."}, {"title": "IV. GENERATIVE DIFFUSION MODEL-BASED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FRAMEWORK", "content": "In this section, we first present the rationale for adopting generative diffusion models in addressing Lyapunov optimiza-tion problems, and discuss the associated challenges. We then detail our proposed framework that integrates generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning."}, {"title": "A. Motivation and Challenges", "content": "The exploration of the potential applications of different GenAI models in Section III-B has demonstrated that in addition to generating diverse digital content, GenAI models can efficiently solve Lyapunov optimization problems through adaptive adjustments. Among these GenAI models, GDMS emerge as a particularly promising candidate due to their unique characteristics and advantages.\n\u2022 System Stability. GDMs provide a stable and controlled optimization path through their step-by-step denoising ap-proach to solve Lyapunov optimization problems. Specif-ically, beginning with pure noise (random optimization solutions), GDMs iteratively remove noise to generate optimal solutions. At each denoising step, solutions are gradually refined to minimize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function, avoiding sudden policy changes. This balance between stability and performance inherently aligns with the fundamental characteristics of Lyapunov optimization problems.\n\u2022 Local Optima Avoidance. GDMs progressively sample solutions to minimize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function by predicting the noise that should be removed at each denoising step. During this process, additional Gaus-sian noise is introduced to maintain randomness and pre-serve the generative capabilities of the GDMs. Through this noise-guided exploration mechanism, GDMs both prevent premature convergence and avoid local optima, addressing the challenge of finding globally optimal so-lutions.\nHowever, a fundamental challenge in leveraging GDMs for Lyapunov optimization problems in wireless networks lies in the inherent difficulty of obtaining optimal solutions as reference \"ground truth\" data. Unlike traditional applications of GDMs such as in image generation, where original images are readily available for training, optimal solutions in wire-less networks are often computationally prohibitive to obtain, especially in dynamic environments in which channel states, user demands, and network topology constantly change. This challenge is particularly critical in Lyapunov optimization, as ensuring system stability while optimizing performance objectives requires precise and reliable solution generation."}, {"title": "B. The Proposed Framework", "content": "As shown in Fig. 3, we propose a novel GDM-based reinforcement learning framework\u00b2 to address the challenge of requiring optimal solutions as reference data in traditional GDM applications. In this framework, optimal solutions are generated through continuous interactions with the environ-ment, utilizing solely the reverse process. During this process, the training objective shifts from minimizing the reconstruc-tion loss of predicted noise removal at each denoising step to maximizing the cumulative rewards in the RL framework. We next detail the framework of our proposed approach.\n\u2022 State Space. The state space s(t) typically consists of environment conditions at time slot t, including channel state information $H_n(t)$ that represents network con-ditions, virtual energy queue lengths $Q_n(t)$ of various UAVs that reflect system stability, and both computation and communication resource availability $B_n(t)$. These states provide a comprehensive view of the system's current parameters, which are fed into the GDMs to generate the corresponding optimization solutions.\n\u2022 Action Space. The action space a(t) represents optimiza-tion solutions generated through the GDM's denoising process based on observations of the current system state s(t). The action space includes network control variables, i.e., UAV trajectory planning $\u03be_n (t)$, power control levels $C_n(t)$, and resource allocation decisions $b_n(t)$, designed to minimize the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty functions.\n\u2022 Reward Function. After executing action action a(t) in response to state s(t), the environment provides feedback in the form of a reward r(t). This reward function is crucial, as it reflects both the Lyapunov drift and penalty terms: the drift component incentivizes queue stability by penalizing excessive queue lengths or sudden queue variations, while the penalty term incorporates perfor-mance metrics such as energy efficiency and through-put. This reward function, formulated as the negative of the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty expression, ensures that maximizing the reward aligns with minimizing the Lyapunov objective."}, {"title": "V.

Performance Evaluation", "content": "Fig. 4 illustrates the convergence behavior of the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty function value (reward) for both our pro-posed GDM-based DDPG and the conventional DDPG across training episodes.

Moreover, the GDM-based DDPG exhibits more stable reward convergence. The results demonstrate that GDMS in the proposed framework can iteratively reduce noise through the reverse process while maximizing rewards, thereby en-hancing action sampling efficiency. The systematic denoising process not only helps avoid local optima-a common chal-lenge in Lyapunov optimization but also provides an efficient mechanism for solution space exploration, particularly in the highly dynamic environment of UAV-based LAE networking. \nFig. 5(a) compares the average uplink transmission rates from ground IoT devices across different methods with in-creasing system bandwidth. The proposed GDM-based DDPG consistently outperforms other methods across all bandwidth levels.

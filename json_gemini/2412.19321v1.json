Nevertheless, how to obtain accurate and rational evaluation from assessments produced by experts is still an open problem. Specially, intuitionistic fuzzy set provides an effective solution in handling indeterminate information. And Yager proposes a novel method for fusion of probabilistic evidence to handle uncertain and conflicting information lately which is called soft likelihood function. This paper devises a novel framework of soft likelihood function based on information volume of fuzzy membership and credibility measure for extracting truly useful and valuable information from uncertainty.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "DUE to its effectiveness in handling uncertain information, multi-criterion applied in lots of relative fields, including but not limited to risk evaluation [27], [32], [39], supplier selection [1], [5], [38], fault diagnosis [43], [46]. However, how to obtain accurate decisions from uncertain environment and complex source is still an open issue [13], [19].\n\nTraditionally, experts are supposed to provide accurate evaluation on actual situations based on random alternative [29]. But the process of producing judgments may be too arbitrary and subjective, which can lead to unexpected results. Therefore, a new concept of linguistic variable is designed to better conform to intuition of human instead of assigning specifically certain values to subjects. In other words, it is not reasonable to require experts to provide accurate judgments on different situations [16]. Besides, it can be concluded that the introduction of linguistic variable enables decision making to become more feasible [4], [25], [28]. Utilizing linguistic variables, some useful and meaningful techniques are developed such as intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [2], [40], [48], [49], interval-valued IFS [6], [22], [50] and other categories of fuzzy technologies [3], [9], [15], [24].\n\nIn real life, in the process of generating estimations, experts may encounter different circumstances which shape varied judgments on actual conditions [18], [26], [44]. Degree of affirmation, negation and hesitancy from experts change with standard of knowledge or other potential influential factors in the process of recognition of situations. Compared with relative approaches in information modeling, IFS is more flexible and possesses superiority in handling uncertainty and conflicts.\n\nFurthermore, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory has been recognized as an efficient framework to handle uncertainty and incomplete information [14], [20]. It offers a robust mechanism for combining evidence from different sources to arrive at a degree of belief that considers all available information. D-S evidence theory extends the classical probability theory by allowing the representation of uncertainty and conflict explicitly, making it particularly effective in multi-criteria decision-making scenarios. The integration of D-S evidence theory into decision-making processes enhances the ability to deal with complex and uncertain environments, offering a complementary perspective to existing fuzzy technologies and improving overall robustness [12].\n\nMoreover, in order to appropriately and effectively manage ambiguity, Yager propose a softer process in combining uncertain information [45] based on original likelihood function and OWA operators [23] to avoid generating too absolute and counter-intuitive results, which is named as soft likelihood function (SLF). And some interesting researches are developed on the base of SLF [30], [34], [37] which provide some efficient solutions to extract instructive information from uncertainty. Because of the feasibility and excellent performance of soft likelihood function [17], it is introduced into the process of MCDM under intuitionistic environment in order to obtain correct and reasonable proofs for decision and strategy designing in this paper. And the contributions of the proposed framework for MCDM are listed as follows:\n\n\u2022 Information volume of fuzzy membership and credibility measure of judgments of experts are properly combined to serve as a new dimension of estimation of each judgment among the ones belongs to groups.\n\u2022 A novel method of producing fuzzy preference relation is devised for detecting degrees of importance of every node contained in information, which further improves sensitivity of the whole framework in erasing dirty data.\n\u2022 A process of generating varied attitude characters (ACs) is designed. The superiority of this operation is that the phenomenon of setting AC for information manually and subjectively is avoided, which reduces the possibility in producing counter-intuitive results on account of unexpected fictitious factors.\n\u2022 The proposed framework for SLF is able to obtain sufficiently accurate and rational results for decision and strategy making.\n\nThe remaining part of the paper is organized as follows."}, {"title": "II. PRELIMINARIES", "content": "Some related concepts are briefly introduced in this part. Some interesting work are completed based on them, such as decision making under intuitionistic environment [10], [33], network model [21], expert decision using Z-number [36] and information management based on soft likelihood function [8].\n\n**A. Intuitionistic fuzzy set [2]**\n\nLet R be a finite universe of discourse. Then, an IFS T can be defined as:\n\n$T = {(r, \\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r)) | r\\in R}$   (1)\n\nwhere\n\n$\\rho_T(r) : R \\rightarrow [0, 1], \\varphi_T(r) : R \\rightarrow [0, 1]$   (2)\n\nand the property satisfied by the IFS can be defined as:\n\n$0 \\leq \\rho_T(r) + \\varphi_T(r) \\leq 1, \\forall r \\in R$   (3)\n\nin which $\\rho_T(r)$ indicates the degree of membership and $\\varphi_T(r)$ indicates the degree of non-membership with respect to $r \\in R$.\n\nBesides, the degree of hesitance can be defined as:\n\n$\\xi_T(r) = 1 - \\rho_T(r) - \\varphi_T(r)$   (4)\n\nMoreover, in a more simple expression, the tuple t =\n($\\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r), \\xi_T(r)$) is utilized to represent an intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), which can be regarded as one element of set T.\n\n**B. First-order information volume of fuzzy membership function [7]**\n\nAssume there exist one IFN t = ($\\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r), \\xi_T(r)$), then the information volume of it can be defined as:\n\n$EIFN(t) = -(\\rho_T(r) log_2 \\rho_T(r)+ \\varphi_T(r) log_2 \\varphi_T(r) + \\xi_T(r) log_2 \\frac{\\xi_T(r)}{C})$   (5)\n\nin which the parameter C indicates the cardinal number of fuzzy sets which can be defined as:\n\n$C = \\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{(traditional fuzzy sets)}\\\\\n3 & \\text{(intuitionistic fuzzy set)}\n\\end{cases}$   (6)\n\nAfter evaluation, the value of entropy reaches its zenith when $\\rho_T(r) = \\varphi_T(r) = \\frac{1}{3}$, $\\xi_T(r) = \\frac{1}{3}$."}, {"title": "C. Score function for IFS", "content": "Assume there exist one IFN t = ($\\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r), \\xi_T(r)$), then the score function can be defined as:\n\n$SF(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\rho_T)(1 - \\varphi_T)$   (7)\n\nIt can be concluded that when the value of SF(t) becomes smaller, T(r) is regarded less reliable.\n\n**D. A Jensen-Shannon divergence-based distance measure for IFS [42]**\n\nAssume there exist two IFSs G = {<r, $\\rho_G(r)$, $\\varphi_G(r)$> | r $\\in$ R} and V = {<r, $\\rho_V(r)$, $\\varphi_V(r)$ >| r $\\in$ R} under the finite universe of discourse R. And the degree of hesitancy can be obtained by $\\xi_G(r) = 1 - \\rho_G(r) - \\varphi_G(r)$ and $\\xi_V(r) = 1 - \\rho_V(r) - \\varphi_V(r)$. Then, the distance measure of IFS can be defined as:\n\n$D(Z, V) = \\frac{1}{2 * |R|} [\\sum_{r=1}^{|R|} (\\rho_G(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\rho_G(r)}{\\rho_G(r) + \\rho_V(r)} + \\rho_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\rho_V(r)}{\\rho_G(r) + \\rho_V(r)} + \\varphi_G(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\varphi_G(r)}{\\varphi_G(r) + \\varphi_V(r)} + \\varphi_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\varphi_V(r)}{\\varphi_G(r) + \\varphi_V(r)} + \\xi_G(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\xi_G(r)}{\\xi_G(r) + \\xi_V(r)} + \\xi_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\xi_V(r)}{\\xi_G(r) + \\xi_V(r)})]$   (8)\n\n**E. Closeness centrality [41]**\n\nThe closeness centrality represents the level of difficulty of the process that one point reaches other points which can be defined as:\n\n$CC_f = \\frac{F-1}{\\sum_{j\\neq f} D_{fj}}$   (9)\n\nin which F indicates the total number of points and $D_{fj}$ represents the distance between f and j.\n\n**F. Z-number [47]**\n\nZ-number is proposed by Zadeh to better handle uncertain information which can be defined as:\n\n$ZN = {\\Upsilon, \\Omega} = ZN+(Y, \\tau_{\\Upsilon} \\cdot P_{H_{\\Upsilon}} is \\Omega)$   (10)\n\nY is a fuzzy constraint with respect to certain problem $H_Y$ and U is an estimation of reliability of Y. Besides, the variable $H_Y$ is stochastic for Y and the membership of Y and U are represented by $\\rho_Y(r)$ and $\\rho_U(r)$. Additionally, Y and U are not independent with each other which are connected by the hidden probability $P_{H_Y}$.\n\n**G. Fuzzy preference relation [31]**\n\nAssume there exist a set T = {$t_1, t_2,..., t_k$}, a fuzzy preference relation F can be expressed by a complementary matrix FPRM = ($f_{we}$)$_{k \\times k}$ which can be defined as:\n\n$f_{we} > 0, f_{we} + f_{ew} = 1, f_{ww} = \\frac{1}{2}, w, e = 1,2,...,k$   (11)"}, {"title": "III. SOME DISCUSSIONS ON THE DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PRESENTED METHOD", "content": "The method proposed in this paper first takes the relationship of individual IFSs which are within one group of judgments made by one expert to further indicate the role of each part of a group of IFS. Then, by considering the situation of the judgments in all estimation produce by expert, the total degree of reliability of judgments can be obtained. Besides, another dimension of assessing the conditions of judgments in the form of IFS individually is designed by introducing the information volume of fuzzy membership function to ensure the judgments are assigned a comprehensive estimation. Through combining the weights generated by reliability measure and information volume, a new framework based on dynamic attitude characters of soft likelihood function can be obtained. Compared with the traditional formula of soft likelihood function [45], the difference is that the attitude characters in the traditional one are set subjectively without taking internal and external factors of these judgments into consideration, which is not a intuitive operation because the attitude character can not be exactly the same for different judgments. However, in some related works, the attitude character dose not vary with the changes of source of information and conditions of information itself. In order to overcome this drawback, the method of generating attitude character is designed and the corresponding formula of varied expression of improved soft likelihood function is also produced. After necessary checking and comparisons with other effective method, the improved version of soft likelihood function performs very well in decision making and strategy designing.\n\nBesides, the expectation of the performance of the presented method can be concluded into two points. The first one is that the proposed method highlights the most credible judgments produced by experts and exaggerates the values of indicators with respect to estimations on actual situations. Therefore, the differences of values of indicator can be obvious enough and even very divergent with each other, which is determined by the feature of the method of generation of attitude character and original soft likelihood function. The second is an extension of the first one. The crucial point needing to be emphasized is that what is expected to be concerned is the final results of the judgments on certain subjects instead of focusing on the difference of values of incompletely processed data. For decision makers, the thing to determine the priority of different decisions and strategy is the most important. Therefore, the values of judgments produced by algorithms are expected to be straightforward and clear for decision and strategy making, then the performance and the credibility of them can be believable and efficient"}, {"title": "IV. NOVEL FRAMEWORK OF SOFT LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION IN EXPERT DECISION SYSTEMS", "content": "In this section, a new framework of soft likelihood function is proposed to handle multiple criteria decision making problems. The presented method takes attributes of information provided into consideration fully so as to generate enough accurate estimations to actual situations. And the detailed process of the presented method is given as below:\n\nStep 1: Obtain corresponding information for linguistic variables in decision making. Then, transfer them into the form of IFS. Linguistic variables are widely utilized to manage uncertain information for decision makers. One thing which is supposed to be pointed out is that if experts are familiar with the concept of IFS, they can make judgments directly based on IFS.\n\nStep 2: Utilize the concept of traditional score function, a formula is devised to calculate measurement of reliability of each individual IFS. For example, assume there exist one IFS I = ($\\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r)$), the degree of reliability of it can be defined as:\n\n$SF(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\rho_T)(1 - \\varphi_T)$   (19)\n\nBecause the degree of membership is a crucial factor which indicates the general situation of judgments given by experts, then the formula focuses on the influence brought by the membership and the part which dose not opposes certain subjects evaluated.\n\nStep 3: Then, the fuzzy numbers can be transferred into the form which can be defined as:\n\n$I_Z = ((\\rho_T(r), \\varphi_T(r)), SF(t), I)$   (20)\n\nStep 4: Combine the transformed fuzzy numbers by getting products of degree of reliability and membership and non-membership. The detailed process can be defined as:\n\n$I = (\\rho_T(r) \\times SF(t), \\varphi_T(r) \\times SF(t))$   (21)\n\nStep 5: Calculate distances of IFSs within groups, D(Z, V), by utilizing Jensen-Shannon divergence-based distance measure which can be defined as:\n\n$D(Z, V) = \\frac{1}{2 * |R|} [\\sum_{r=1}^{|R|} (\\rho_Z(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\rho_Z(r)}{\\rho_Z(r) + \\rho_V(r)} + \\rho_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\rho_V(r)}{\\rho_Z(r) + \\rho_V(r)} + \\varphi_Z(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\varphi_Z(r)}{\\varphi_Z(r) + \\varphi_V(r)} + \\varphi_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\varphi_V(r)}{\\varphi_Z(r) + \\varphi_V(r)} + \\xi_Z(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\xi_Z(r)}{\\xi_Z(r) + \\xi_V(r)} + \\xi_V(r)log_2\\frac{2 * \\xi_V(r)}{\\xi_Z(r) + \\xi_V(r)})]$   (22)\n\nStep 6: Produce similarity measure for IFSs. Assume there exist one IFS $Z_i$ and other IFSs which are contained in one group with $Z_i$ are denoted by $Z_k$ and the total number of IFSs in one group is M. Then, the similarity for IFS $Z_i$ can be produced by the formula which can be defined as:\n\n$SM_{Z_i} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{k\\neq i} D(Z_i, Z_k)$   (23)\n\nStep 7: Generate fuzzy preference relation in groups of IFSs. Assume there exist two similarity of IFSs which can be given as $SM_{Z_i}$ and $SM_{Z_j}$. Then, normalize the two similarities using the formula which can be de-fined as:\n\n$\\upsilon = \\frac{SM_{Z_i}}{SM_{Z_i} + SM_{Z_j}}, \\quad \\varphi = \\frac{SM_{Z_j}}{SM_{Z_i} + SM_{Z_j}}$   (24)\n\nthen, compare the two parameter $\\upsilon$ and $\\varphi$, if $\\upsilon$ is bigger than $\\varphi$, then it can be regarded that $Z_i$ prefers $Z_j$ to be considered as the reference in the decision making; on the contrary, if $\\varphi$ is bigger than $\\upsilon$, then it can be regarded that $Z_j$ prefers $Z_i$ to be considered as the reference in the decision making. Besides, when $\\upsilon$ and $\\varphi$ are identically equal, there exist no winner in comparison. The preferred ones are allocated an indicator of 1 and the other ones are distributed 0, then one fuzzy preference relation matrix can be constructed which can be defined as:\n\n$FPRM = \\begin{bmatrix}\npr_{11} & pr_{12} & ... & pr_{1k} \\\\\npr_{21} & pr_{22} & ... & pr_{2k} \\\\\n: & : & : & : \\\\\npr_{k1} & pr_{k2} & ... & pr_{kk}\n\\end{bmatrix}, prij = 0,1$   (25)\n\nThe final results of FPRM with respect to one IFS are summed to indicate the importance of it in decision making. For one IFS $Z_i$, its corresponding point can be defined as:\n\n$PO_{Z_i} = \\sum_{j\\neq i} prij$   (26)\n\nStep 8: Obtain the final judgments of IFSs withing groups using the results of points obtained based on the fuzzy preference relation. Assume there exist one groups of judgments in the form of IFS and the according values of points can be given as $A_{Z_i} = {PO_{Z1}, PO_{Z2}, \u2026, PO_{Zk}}$. Then, the weights indicating the role of calculating divergences among groups of IFSs for any one of IFSs can be defined as:\n\n$B_{Z_i} = \\frac{PO_{Z_i}}{\\sum_{l=1}^{k} PO_{Z_i}}$   (27)\n\nStep 9:Calculate total distances of groups of IFSs using judgments. Assume there exist the first group of IFSs which is denoted by Z and othen groups which are represented by {$V_2, ..., V_N$}. Then, the total distance between groups of Z and $V_2$ can be calculated as:\n\n$D(Z, V_2)_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} B_{Z_i} \\times D(Z, V^2)$   (28)\n\nStep 10: Compute the credibility measurement of groups of IFSs. Taking the complete environment of groups of IFSs within judgments produced by one expert into consideration, the degree of credibility of one group Z can be defined as:\n\n$CR_Z = \\frac{ D(Z, V_2)_{total}}{ |\\sum_{j=1}^{m} D(Z, V_j)_{total}}$   (29)\n\nStep 11: Normalize the degree of credibility. And the process of the normalization with respect to Z can be defined as:\n\n$CRN_Z = \\frac{CR_Z}{CR_Z + \\sum_{l=2}^{N} CR_V}$   (30)\n\nStep 12: Obtain the total information volume of each groups of original IFSs.

APPLICATION", "content": "In this section, an application is provided to illustrate the efficiency of the presented method.\n\nNowadays, in general, manufactures may establish relationships with material suppliers to make sure the sources of materials of production of products are abundant and healthy. However, it is necessary to make estimation about the quality of materials from suppliers from time to time, because the environment of supply and relation in collaboration may vary, which indicates that it is a metabolic problem. Moreover, due to the complexity of the problem, how to fully utilize uncertain information offered is one of the most important concern in fuzzy decision making under this kind of case. Therefore, the proposed algorithm in handling uncertain information possesses superiority in this filed, because it is exactly designed to sufficiently extract all useful part of information to serve as a proof in decision and strategy making.\n\nAssume there exist one review meeting and three experts participate it to make assessment on five suppliers. More specifically, in order to make the process of estimation on the suppliers more accurate under the condition that Suppliers quits the process of estimation, each expert appends one more vote in the second round. Besides, in the round three, a new Suppliers joins in the review meeting. And the detailed information about the judgments in provided.\n\nBased on the description of the problem, the process of proposed method is divided into three parts, namely round 1, 2 and 3. The calculation of the method presented in this paper is provided."}, {"title": "VI. COMPARISON AND DISCUSSIONS ON THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY PROPOSED METHOD", "content": "In this part, some comparisons are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results are provided.\n\n**A. Round 1**\n\nIn the first round, the results obtained by StaticMCDM, DynamicMCDM and the proposed method are exactly the same. However, in regard to AQM [11], the estimation about Suppliers and Supplier4 are opposite compared with results of other three methods. The reasons for preferring Supplier4 instead of Supplier3 are well illustrated in [35] from its own dimension of viewpoints. And the detailed causes are further explained on the base of data generated in the course of completing the process of the novel framework of soft likelihood function.\n\nThe first reason for this phenomenon is that the values of reliability measurement of Supplier4 are generally bigger than that of Suppliers, which illustrates that Supplier4 possesses more affirmative part of information according to the definition of reliability function. It indicates that experts mainly prefer Supplier4 to Supplier3 well.\n\nThe second reason is that the degree of credibility of Supplier4 is closer to each other than Suppliers, which demonstrates that the judgments from experts are consistent with each other and can be fully trusted. On the contrary, the information of Supplier4 has more conflicting parts than Suppliers, which can be obtained from the divergence of the value of degree of credibility. Therefore, when information conflicts, it is not convincing to distribute a comparatively high level of belief to it, which is fully embodied by the process of soft likelihood function [45].\n\nThe third reason is an extension of the second one. The information volume of Supplier3 diverges much more than Supplier4, which is also an indicator that judgments given by experts are very different from each other. Therefore, the information about Supplier3 transfers more negative signals in the role of decision and strategy making.\n\nIn one word, the relation $S4 > S3$ is correct and valid.\n\n**B. Round 2**\n\nAll of the methods reach an agreement in the judgments with respect to all of the Supplier discussed. Therefore, there is no need to have further discussions about the final results of judgments.\n\n**C. Round 3**\n\nIn the third round, it can be summarized that AQM, Dynamic MCDM and the proposed method reach an agreement on the estimation of actual situations. Moreover, some detailed causes are clearly given in [35] based on its own techniques. And some other standpoints are provided utilizing data obtained by proposed method.\n\nFirst, the degree of credibility of Suppliers are much more divergent than Suppliers, which indicates that there exist conflicting information in the judgments about Supplier5. Besides, it is also an evidence that the situation of information with respect to Suppliers are in chaos and the confidence level of it is lowered which embodies in the priority ranking of Supplier5.\n\nSecond, the value of information volume is also a proof of the conclusion of the first part of reason. The information volume of Suppliers is much more consistent than the one of Supplier5, which proves that the information provided by experts may be extremely varied when compared with each other.\n\nThird, when checking the degree of reliability generated for Suppliers and Supplier5 which is not provided, the mean value of the reliability of Supplier3 is much higher than the one of Supplier5, which well illustrates that there exist a relatively bigger part of positive information about Supplier3 according to the definition of reliability function.\n\nAll in all, the relation $S3 > S5$ is reasonable and rational."}, {"title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "content": "In this paper, a novel framework of soft likelihood function is proposed to serve for expert decision systems based on credibility measure, information volume and certain transformations.

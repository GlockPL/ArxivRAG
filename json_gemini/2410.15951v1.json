The current landscape is where decisions are increasingly data-driven by financial institutions with an appetite for automation while mitigating risks. The segments of financial institutions which are getting heavily influenced are retail banking, wealth management, corporate banking & payment ecosystem. The solution ranges from onboarding the customers all the way fraud detection & prevention to enhancing the customer services. Financial Institutes are leap frogging with integration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mainstream applications and enhancing operational efficiency through advanced predictive analytics, extending personalized customer experiences, and automation to minimize risk with fraud detection techniques. However, with Adoption of AI & ML, it is imperative that the financial institute also needs to address ethical and regulatory challenges, by putting in place robust governance frameworks and responsible Al practices.", "sections": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is one area in which the age-old financial system will witness a revolution - making it more efficient, precise, and innovative. In this paper, we delve into changing the face of finance by AI & ML ranging from personalised customer experience to advanced risk management and much more.\nAI and ML have started transforming the financial sector by managing complicated tasks, processing vast data volumes at lightning speed with accuracy, as well as predictive insights that were unattainable earlier with traditional methods. In several ways, these advancements are not only refining operational efficiencies in financial institutions but also improving the decision-making abilities available with more personalized solutions that suit varied needs of clients and stakeholders.\nAl and ML are also substantially contributing to effective risk management with intricate algorithms that can quickly detect anomalies, predict market trends by identifying patterns in the data stream, adhering more rigorously than ever to stringent regulatory requirements. To protect themselves from potential threats, the agencies assertively test for vulnerabilities in a financial system based on trust and reliable information.\nMoreover, the contribution of AI/ML in finance has upgraded traditional services to tech- enabled solutions with automated investment advisory, trade algorithms and personalized wealth management solutions. These advancements are empoweringfinancial services, enabling both individuals and businesses to make informed decisions and complete their respective fiscal goals more efficiently than ever.\nSumming up, it is not merely a technological upgrade but a change in thinking for the finance industry to leverage AI and ML as a transition from traditional mode of doing business which will open unimaginable areas of growth, efficiencies besides customer centricity. As banks and other financial institutions adopt these technologies, they are set to alter the state of finance by opening up new opportunities and creating unprecedented value within an ever more interconnected global economy.\nFrom retail banking to corporate banking, from property and casualty to personal lines, and from portfolio management to trade processing, the next wave of digital disruption in financial services has been unleashed by the concepts and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Together, AI and ML are undoubtedly creating one of the largest technological transformations the world has ever witnessed. Within the advanced streams of research in Al and ML, human intelligence blended with the cognitive reasoning of machines is finally out of the labs and into real-time applications.\nThe Financial Services sector is one of the early adopters of this revolution and arguably much ahead of its leverage compared to other sectors. Built on the conceptual foundations of Innovation diffusion, and a contemporary perspective of enterprise customer life-cycle journe across the Al-value chain defined by McKinsey Global Institute (2017), the current study attempts to highlight the features and use-cases of early-adopters of this transformation. With the theoretical underpinning of technology adoption lifecycle, this paper is an earnest attempt to comment on how Al and ML have been significantly transforming the Financial Services market space from the lens of a domain practitioner, [1-2]."}, {"title": "WHAT IS AI & ML", "content": "AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are the two most powerful words that have revolutionized every industry from finance to healthcare, retail as well more."}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)", "content": "The Actual Meaning:\nThe ability to simulate human intelligence in systems that are capable of thinking and learning like humans.

Using such vast data financial institutions can improve services based on the feedback, anticipate what customers would be most interested in and eventually lead discovery-driven innovation delivering better solutions that meet customer expectations.\nPersonalized services bridge the gap between a financial institution and its customers and are built on trust. The more we trust the product, the keener we are to disclose our personal information in order to receive a highly personalized service that maximizes consumer value. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help financial institutions tailor relevant products and services to their customers as well as improve their credit risk management, compliance, and fraud detection capabilities by incorporating chatbots and face recognition systems. The close association between technology and Finance has resulted in the revolution of financial aspects with the help of the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) (Giudici, 2018). There are three main components of associating Al and Finance with its application: the problems it engenders and the benefits associated. Exploring these components is akin to opening a portal to a world where Al facilitates the comprehension of intricate financial patterns, where challenges are transformed into opportunities for learning, and where favourable outcomes reshape our perceptions of money (ozili,2021), [14-17].\nBanks should prioritize using advanced analytics (AA) and machine learning (ML) in decisions across the customer life cycle."}, {"title": "FUTURE SCOPE", "content": "AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are poised to play a very significant role in both customer experiences as well as operational efficiencies within financial services that will have a massive economic impact on the industry.

The Next Generation of Financial Services Industry will be reimagined by joint initiatives from fintech startups, established financial institutions & tech giants.\nThe layers of the AI-bank capability stack are interdependent and must work in unison to deliver value, as discussed in the first article in our series on the Al bank of the future. In our second article, we examined how Al-first banks are reimagining customer engagement to provide superior experiences across diverse bank platforms and partner ecosystems Hyper- personalization process with learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for marketing functions like segmentation, targeting, and positioning based on real-time analytics throughout the customer journey and key factors driving effective customer-centric marketing. with varied customer demands and preferences, it's imperative for businesses to cater to their needs and sustain growth. Use of AI enables hyper-personalized customer experience which is extended by analyzing vast amounts of data to understand customer's individual preferences & map their behaviour [20-23]. Manual fraud detection has become inefficient due to the intricate nature and high volume of transactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already a very efficient technology for detecting and preventing financial crime [24]. Generative Al can be used in the financial sector for generating financial models, predicting market trends, and optimizing investment strategies. It can also assist in fraud detection and risk assessment, [25,26]."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "To conclude, the future of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) in finance has immense potential to revolutionize the finance industry.

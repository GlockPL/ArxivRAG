It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid development of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, the increasingly complex wireless functions and the deployment of massive radio nodes necessitate a deeper understanding of radio information [1]. A radio map, which is a representation of the characteristics of radio signals over a specific geographic area, such as the received signal strengths (RSS) [2], transmission environment [3], and other factors, can be used to understand and visualize the coverage, quality of service, and data rate of radio signals in a given area. A radio map with high accuracy intuitively illustrates the global radio conditions of wireless propagations, based on which the performance of wireless networks in terms of spectral efficiency [4] and localization accuracy [5] can be enhanced significantly.\nRecently, many researchers have been motivated to explore radio map-assisted applications across various scenarios, ranging from localization and navigation to channel modeling and user identification. In [6], the authors proposed a deep Gaussian process for indoor radio map construction and user location estimation based on RSS samples from multiple access points. In [7], a mobile robotic platform was developed that simultaneously constructs spatial and radio maps to support location-based services in indoor environments. A radio map-based coverage-aware navigation approach for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles was proposed in [8]. Additionally, a localized statistical channel modeling approach based on radio maps, which is aware of the targeted propagation environment, was introduced in [9]. In [10], a radio map-based channel charting framework was proposed for radio fingerprinting without the need for reference signals.\nHowever, the construction of high accuracy radio map is very challenging for the two following reasons. First, the sampling rate of radio sensors is too sparse for radio map construction. Specifically, precise radio information can only be obtained through the deployment of radio sensors. Due to the hardware cost and the deployment area limitation of the radio sensors, the spacial sampling rate of radio of a radio map is usually less than 1% in practical systems [11]. This means that over 99% of the information needed for a radio map cannot be directly obtained through radio sensing techniques. Second, the effective bandwidth of a radio map is determined by the working bandwidth of the radio sensors. In order to obtain the radio map that contains the signal information of common wireless systems, ranging from very low frequency (VLF)"}, {"title": "A. Background of Radio Map", "content": "band to Ka band, the deployment cost of the radio sensors can be extremely high.\nTo tackle the above challenges, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been considered as a promising technique for high accuracy radio map construction [12]. A well trained generative model for radio map construction is capable to obtain the knowledge of propagation channel of wireless signals in all the working bands [13]. Based on the sparse sampled signals and the generative model, a high accuracy wide band radio map with high resolution can be obtained [14]. A necessary foundation of training the high accuracy generative model for radio map construction is to build a massive radio map dataset that not only precisely describes the propagation feature of radio signals, but also covers various transmission scenarios and transmission frequency bands [15]. In what follows, we introduce the related works in radio map dataset generation."}, {"title": "B. Related Works and Our Contribution", "content": "One of the most common way for radio map generation is the channel model based method. According to general rules of radio signal propagation, path loss is often modeled using variations of log-normal shadowing models, such as the 3GPP model described in [16]. Given the location and configuration of transmitters, a radio map can be generated based on the adopted channel model. Works such as [17]\u2013[19] adopted channel model based radio map dataset generation and trained their generative models accordingly for radio map construction. Although the channel model-based approach is relatively easy to implement, it often lacks consistency with realistic scenarios for disregarding the radio wave propagation characteristic in specific environment along specific paths.\nWhile the channel model-based method provides a rough estimation of radio propagation, the ray-tracing method offers a more precise and site-specific approach [20]. This method simulates electromagnetic waves as rays radiating from the transmitter in a finely detailed space. These rays interact with objects in the environment, accounting for reflections and potentially even diffraction or transmission [21]. Finally, the rays reaching the receiver are combined to calculate path loss or other channel information. Recently, emerging studies have been adopting the ray-tracing method for more precise radio map dataset generation. For instance, the Radio MapSeer proposed in [2], which contains 56,000 two-dimension (2D) radio maps in urban scenario.\nAlthough ray-tracing for radio map generation is highly precise, its computational cost is extremely high due to the complex calculations involving massive transmission rays. Recently, several commercial simulation platforms for ray-tracing simulations have been developed to"}, {"title": null, "content": "facilitate efficient radio map generation, such as the WinProp and the Wireless Insite. Many researchers use these platforms to create their own datasets for training generative models for radio map construction [22]\u2013[25]. However, these datasets are either not publicly available [22], [23], or focus on a specific field [24], [25]. For example, the dataset in [24] contains 2D radio maps for urban scenarios over five frequencies. The dataset in [25] contains 2D radio maps in urban scenario with directional antenna. To ensure fair and accurate evaluation of generative models for radio map construction, the development of a comprehensive benchmark radio map dataset that encompasses a wide range of scenarios and fields is essential.\nSeveral significant gaps exist between the current datasets and the targeted benchmark dataset. First, all existing radio map datasets focus on urban scenarios, neglecting other terrain scenarios, such as rural and mountainous area. This limitation weakens the generative models' generalization for radio map construction across different terrain scenarios. Second, current radio map datasets only consider the electromagnetic impact of objects above the ground, such as buildings and trees, while omitting terrain information such as geographic altitude and terrain material, which significantly affects radio signal propagation. Third, existing datasets focus solely on radio maps of terrestrial networks, and no spatial three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset containing information at different heights has been released. This omission restricts the study of generative models for radio map construction in non-terrestrial networks, such as space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). Finally, existing radio map datasets primarily focus on C-band propagation, preventing the generative model from performing radio map construction in the frequency domain.\nTo address the above challenges, we present the largest and most comprehensive open-source radio map dataset, named SpectrumNet, to support the study of generative models for radio map construction. Additionally, we provide examples of experiments based on this dataset. The key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.\n1) We present SpectrumNet, the largest open-source radio map dataset, containing over 300,000 radio map images. This dataset includes eleven different geographical scenarios and three climate scenarios, making it the first to consider terrain, weather, and object material information. Additionally, SpectrumNet offers variations in five different frequencies and is the first spatial 3D dataset to include radio maps at three different height levels.\n2) We introduce the open-source SpectrumNet dataset and perform experiments to train generative models for radio map construction based on this dataset. The structural similar-"}, {"title": null, "content": "ity (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and root mean square error (RMSE) of three baseline methods for radio map construction are evaluated across different scenarios, frequencies, and heights.\n3) Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset, including the data expansion and the quality enhancement, are discussed. Additionally, emerging research directions of generative models for radio map construction, driven by the SpectrumNet dataset, are envisioned.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the SpectrumNet dataset and explain its properties. In Section III, we evaluate the performance of three methods for radio map construction based on the proposed SpectrumNet dataset in different domains.

Three of the recent released datasets introduced in Section I-B are listed for comparison, i.e., the Radio MapSeer proposed in [2], the RadioGAT proposed in [24], and the RMDirectionalBerlin proposed in [25]."}, {"title": "B. Dataset Properties", "content": "In this part, we introduce the properties of the SpectrumNet dataset. Table II shows the parameters of the samples in the SpectrumNet dataset. OpenStreetMap [26] is used to obtain real-world building maps of 15300 different areas. The size of each area is $1.28km \\times 1.28km$ in the x-y plane, with a spacial resolution of 10m, resulting in radio map images of size $128 \\times 128$.\nThe radio maps are provided at three different heights for each area: 1.5m, 30m, and 200m above the ground, reflecting the radio maps for ground nodes, nodes in buildings, and aerial nodes, respectively. In order to illustrate full band radio propagation, radio maps of five different frequencies ranging from 150 MHz to 22GHz are included, which cover most of the working frequencies of wireless networks. Additionally, the variation of scenarios corresponds to different climates, building materials, and terrain materials, which also affect radio propagation in real world. Therefore, these parameters are also annotated for the generation of every radio map.

As mentioned above, different scenarios have various parameters in terms of terrain materials, object materials, and geographical characteristics. In what follows, we briefly introduce the features of each terrain scenario in SpectrumNet.\n(1) Dense urban: Dense urban areas are characterized by a high density of tall buildings and streets, such as downtown New York City shown in Fig. 1 (a). These areas feature a significant number of rays reflecting and refracting off surfaces. The material of buildings can be cement, marble, glass, and plywood, while the terrain material is mostly cement.\n(2) Ordinary urban: Ordinary urban areas have a lower density of buildings, and the buildings are shorter compared to those in dense urban areas. Small cities and the non-central areas of"}, {"title": null, "content": "big cities are typical examples of ordinary urban area, such as Burgaw, North Carolina, shown in Fig. 1 (b). Both the building material and terrain material in these areas are predominantly cement.\n(3) Rural: Rural areas feature a low density of low-height buildings and large amounts of open space, often utilized as farmland. The terrain material in these areas is predominantly soil. An example of a rural area is near Athens, Greece, as shown in Fig. 1 (c).\n(4) Suburban: In suburban areas, buildings are often clustered within specific zones, with very few buildings outside these areas. The building material is typically cement, while the terrain material includes both soil and cement. The suburban area of Versailles, France, shown in Fig. 1 (d), is a typical example of a suburban area.\n(5) Mountainous: A mountainous area is characterized by significant altitude changes and the presence of large landforms that rise prominently above their surroundings, such as the Himalayas in Nepal, shown in Fig. 1 (e). Radio propagation in mountainous areas is primarily determined by terrain information, where the material is considered as soil.\n(6) Forest: Forest areas typically have flat terrain with grassland material and no buildings. The majority of objects in forests are trees made of wood. An example of a forest area is located near Melbourne, Australia, as shown in Fig. 1 (f).\n(7) Desert: Desert areas are an open spaces with flat terrain, and have no buildings or other objects on the ground. The terrain material is set as soil. An example of desert area is located"}, {"title": null, "content": "near Tucson, Arizona, as shown in Fig. 1 (g).\n(8) Grassland: Similar to desert areas, grassland areas are also open spaces with flat terrain and no buildings or other objects on the ground. The key difference is that the terrain material is grassland, which has different reflection and refraction characteristics compared to soil. An example of a grassland area is near Buenos Aires, Argentina, as shown in Fig. 1 (h).\n(9) Island: Island areas have a large proportion of water surface. The land part of an island may have significant altitude changes from the water surface. The terrain material can be cement, soil, or grassland, and the building material is typically cement. An example of an island area is located in Hong Kong, as shown in Fig. 1 (i).\n(10) Ocean: Ocean areas are completely covered by water surfaces, and have no buildings or other objects.

Fig. 2 illustrates the 3D terrain and building modeling process for radio map generation. We first import the 3D terrain information from OpenStreetMap [26], as shown in Fig. 2 (a), which includes the altitude and material of each sampling point in the x-y plane. Next, the building information, including building height and material, is constructed based on online data from OpenStreetMap and manual supplementation using Google Maps, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Finally, we combine the terrain and building information to create the 3D scenario model for the SpectrumNet dataset, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (c).\nBased on the 3D scenario model, we construct the 3D radio map by sampling the RSS at different heights. The sampling layers of the spatial 3D radio map in the SpectrumNet dataset are presented in Fig. 3. A sampling layer represents the radio map at a specific height above the terrain. SpectrumNet contains three sampling layers at heights of 1.5m, 30m, and 200m, which represent the radio maps of terrestrial networks, in-building networks, and aerial networks, respectively.\nFig. 4 provides an example of a 3D radio map with multiple sampling layers. The 3D map is built based on a dense urban scenario in Shenzhen, China, as shown in Fig. 4 (a), with a transmitter located at the center of this area, and the height of the transmitter is 1.5m.

The building density of the lowest sampling layer in Fig. 4 (b) is higher than that of the highest sampling layer in Fig. 4 (d).

For example, in Fig. 4 (d), the projections of all buildings in the highest sampling layer are distributed on the right side of the transmitter, yet there is still a significant shadow effect on the left side caused by buildings of different heights. This phenomenon demonstrates the necessity of building a 3D radio map dataset rather than a 2D radio map dataset in training generative models for radio map generation in non-terrestrial networks."}, {"title": null, "content": "3) Frequency Variance in the SpectrumNet Dataset: The radio propagation characteristics vary significantly across different frequency bands. To improve the frequency domain generalization capacity of generative models for radio map construction, the SpectrumNet dataset includes radio maps of five different frequency bands. Fig. 5 shows a 2D projection of the buildings and radio maps at different frequency bands with a height of 1.5m. It can be observed that the large scale fading effect differs prominently between the 150 MHz network in Fig. 5(b) and the 22 GHz network in Fig. 5(f). This highlights the importance of including radio maps of various frequency bands in the SpectrumNet dataset to ensure effective frequency domain generalization."}, {"title": null, "content": "4) Weather Parameters in the SpectrumNet Dataset: Various weather parameters are considered in the construction of the SpectrumNet dataset. Based on the ITU specifications [32]\u2013[34], we have built weather models for over 20 cities and regions, taking into account their temperature, air pressure, water vapor density, liquid water density, rain rate, etc. Table III lists the weather parameters for Jarkata as a representative city of tropical climate. For the generation of each radio map, we first randomly select a weather condition for the specific city, such as heavy rain in Jakarta, and then generate the weather parameters within the range provided in the fourth row of Table III. Finally, we integrate the impact of these weather parameters into the ray tracing-based radio map generation as specified in [32]\u2013[34]."}, {"title": "III. EXPERIMENTS ON GENERATIVE MODELS FOR RADIO MAP CONSTRUCTION", "content": "In this section, we present baseline methods for constructing radio maps using the Spectrum-Net dataset. We evaluate the performance of these methods across various terrain scenarios, heights, and frequencies, and discuss the generalization of models trained on the SpectrumNet dataset. Three baseline methods are employed: UNet [27], CBAM [28], and an interpolation algorithm [29]. The three baseline methods cover the main research directions of radio map constructions. UNet and CBAM represent generative model-driven radio map construction methods based on convolutional neural network and Transformer, respectively; while interpolation is a representative wireless channel-driven radio map construction method.\nWe randomly select 50 sampling points as input for radio map construction, with the goal of generating a $128 \\times 128$ radio map, resulting in a sampling rate of 0.3%.

The performance of the models is evaluated using three metrics: SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE."}, {"title": "A. Radio Map Construction in Various Terrain Scenarios", "content": "In this part, we evaluate the performance of radio map generation across various terrain scenarios, with results presented in Table IV. The performance metrics, i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE, generally show consistent trends: higher SSIM values typically correspond to higher PSNR and lower RMSE values. However, the effectiveness of the baseline methods varies significantly depending on the terrain scenarios. Radio maps generated for ocean scenarios, where the terrain is flat and devoid of buildings, achieve the best performance. Conversely, scenarios with complex terrain or numerous buildings and objects, such as dense urban, suburban, and forest areas, yield lower performance with the baseline methods, indicating a need for further research on generative models for radio map construction. Among the baseline methods, CBAM outperforms the others in most cases, highlighting the superiority of this generative model in radio map applications. The performance of UNet and the interpolation algorithm is comparable, with UNet slightly better in PSNR, while the interpolation algorithm performs marginally better in SSIM and RMSE.\nFor better illustration, we provide two examples of radio map generation in dense urban and mountainous scenarios, shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. In each figure, the first subfigure displays the ground truth (GT) of the radio map. The second, third, and forth subfigures show the input information of the sampling points: RSS, terrain altitudes, and building information, respectively.

Multiband Radio Map Construction", "content": "In this part, we evaluate radio map construction across different frequencies. Table VI presents the performance results for five distinct frequency bands. Constructing radio maps for high-frequency networks is notably more challenging than for low-frequency networks, particularly in terms of the SSIM metric. This difficulty arises from the physical characteristics of radio propagation. High-frequency signals experience more severe attenuation due to transmission and reflection by terrain and buildings, making it harder to accurately construct radio maps in environments with complex terrain and building structures. Consequently, further research is urgently needed to develop generative models capable of effectively handling radio map construction in high-frequency networks.\nFig. 10 and Fig. 11 provide examples of radio map construction in networks operating at 150 MHz and 22 GHz, respectively.

The performance of these models in constructing radio maps across various terrain scenarios is presented in Table VII, Table VIII, and Table IX, respectively.\nFor radio map construction in each terrain scenario, the best-performing model is the one trained on data from the identical terrain scenario. Models trained on data from more complex scenarios, such as dense urban and mountainous, exhibit better generalization than those trained on simpler scenarios, like lakes.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORKS FOR DATASET EXPANSION", "content": "In this section, we discuss future works on expanding the SpectrumNet dataset, and the extended applications of generative AI with the SpectrumNet dataset."}, {"title": "A. Dataset Expansion", "content": "1) Spacial Expansion: The projection area of the samples in the current version of the SpectrumNet dataset is $1.28km \\times 1.28km$, which is insufficient to accommodate the radio maps of networks with large cell radius, e.g. multimedia broadcast multicast service networks, where the cell radius can exceed 2km [30]. In future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset, the sample area can be expanded to $5km \\times 5km$ while maintaining the same resolution. This expansion will allow generative models for radio map construction to learn the spatial correlation knowledge of networks with large cell radius.\n2) Full Band Dataset Construction: Although the current version of the SpectrumNet dataset contains multiple working frequencies, the frequency domain resolution is relatively low compared to the granularity of spectrum resource allocation. Future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset will provide higher resolution in the frequency domain, encompassing all commonly used bands for wireless networks.\n3) Time Domain Dataset Construction: Radio map data exhibits time domain correlation in terms of transmitter location, transmission power, climate parameters, etc. However, all existing radio map datasets omit this correlation. In future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset, multiple radio maps in consecutive time slots will be included.

However, with the development of multi-antenna systems, directional beamforming has become more commonly applied [31]. Future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset will include cases reflecting the radio propagation properties of anisotropic RSS distribution caused by directional transmissions.\n5) Dataset Calibration: Radio map datasets such as those in [2], [24], [25] consist of radio maps simulated with ray-tracing-based software, and the accuracy of these simulation platforms has not been verified. In future work, we plan to supplement the radio map data with hardware experiments. We will analyze the similarity between the data collected in realistic scenarios and the simulation data to measure the accuracy of the radio maps.

Extended Studies on Generative Models for Radio Map Construction", "content": "With the open-source SpectrumNet dataset, further applications on data-driven radio map construction can be studied. In this part, we discuss several research directions on generative model for radio map construction using the SpectrumNet dataset.\n1) Generative Model Enhancement: When comparing the performance of generative models for radio map construction in Section III with the works on other datasets [2], [24], [25], we find that the baseline models cannot provide high accuracy radio map construction for multiband 3D scenario with terrain information. Therefore, designing training methods for generative models with the SpectrumNet dataset is necessary and can be explored in the following ways:\n1) Model scale extension: As mentioned above, the parameters and dimensions of the SpectrumNet dataset are much larger than other existing radio map datasets [2], [24], [25]. It is very difficult for models of comparable scale to those in [2], [24], [25] to learn the extensive knowledge embedded within the SpectrumNet dataset. In order to train a high accuracy generative model for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet, the model scale should be enhanced.\n2) Model framework design: Most of the current works on radio map construction utilize generative model frameworks from other visual tasks, such as UNet [27], MAE [35], etc."}, {"title": null, "content": "However, these frameworks may struggle with radio map construction, where the model input is extremely sparse (less than 1% [11]) and of pixel level. As a result, novel framework designs for radio map construction should be further studied.\n3) Channel model assisted model enhancement: It is very challenging and costly to train generative model for radio map construction barely based on datasets with a sophisticated knowledge, such as the SpectrumNet. Leveraging the channel model of wireless networks can simplify the tasks for generative models in radio map construction. For example, a channel model based radio map construction can be added as a preprocessing step for input data. Additionally, it can be incorporated into the loss function for model training.\n2) Cross Domain Radio Map Construction: Current studies on generative models for radio map construction typically focus on one or two specific domains due to the limited dimensions in existing datasets. The SpectrumNet is the first dataset that includes diversities in space, frequency, terrain, and weather domains. With the radio maps in the SpectrumNet dataset, cross domain generative models for radio map construction can be explored as a new research direction. For example, once a space-frequency cross domain model is trained, it becomes possible to estimate the channel of an aerial mmWave network by sampling the signals of a C-band terrestrial network. Cross domain radio map construction is especially valuable for estimating the network conditions of areas and spectrums that cannot be measured directly."}, {"title": "V.

Experimental results have shown that baseline models trained on data of dense urban scenario, terrestrial networks, and high frequency networks have strong generalization when applied to other terrain scenarios, heights, and frequencies. It has also been proved that the existed datasets of single band, height, and terrain scenario, are insufficient for training radio map construction models with generalization capability.\n3) Future works on SpectrumNet have"}]}

It has been considered to be increasingly helpful for the future sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, as wireless nodes are becoming more crowded and complicated. However, the construction of high resolution radio map is very challenging due to the sparse sampling in practical systems. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which is capable to create synthetic data to fill in gaps in real-world measurements, is an effective technique to construct high precision radio maps. Currently, generative models for radio map construction are trained with two-dimension (2D) single band radio maps in urban scenario, which has poor generalization in diverse terrain scenarios, spectrum bands, and heights. To tackle this problem, we provide a multiband three-dimension (3D) radio map dataset with consideration of terrain and climate information, named SpectrumNet. It is the largest radio map dataset in terms of dimensions and scale, which contains the radio map of 3 spacial dimensions, 5 frequency bands, 11 terrain scenarios, and 3 climate scenarios. We introduce the parameters and settings for the SpectrumNet dataset generation, and evaluate three baseline methods for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset. Experiments show the necessity of the SpectrumNet dataset for training models with strong generalization in spacial, frequency, and scenario domains. Future works on the SpectrumNet dataset are also discussed, including the dataset expansion and calibration, as well as the extended studies on generative models for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet dataset.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "With the rapid development of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks, the increasingly complex wireless functions and the deployment of massive radio nodes necessitate a deeper un- derstanding of radio information [1]. A radio map, which is a representation of the characteristics of radio signals over a specific geographic area, such as the received signal strengths (RSS) [2], transmission environment [3], and other factors, can be used to understand and visualize the coverage, quality of service, and data rate of radio signals in a given area. A radio map with high accuracy intuitively illustrates the global radio conditions of wireless propagations, based on which the performance of wireless networks in terms of spectral efficiency [4] and localization accuracy [5] can be enhanced significantly.\nRecently, many researchers have been motivated to explore radio map-assisted applications across various scenarios, ranging from localization and navigation to channel modeling and user identification. In [6], the authors proposed a deep Gaussian process for indoor radio map construction and user location estimation based on RSS samples from multiple access points. In [7], a mobile robotic platform was developed that simultaneously constructs spatial and radio maps to support location-based services in indoor environments. A radio map-based coverage- aware navigation approach for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles was proposed in [8]. Additionally, a localized statistical channel modeling approach based on radio maps, which is aware of the targeted propagation environment, was introduced in [9]. In [10], a radio map- based channel charting framework was proposed for radio fingerprinting without the need for reference signals.\nHowever, the construction of high accuracy radio map is very challenging for the two following reasons. First, the sampling rate of radio sensors is too sparse for radio map construction. Specifically, precise radio information can only be obtained through the deployment of radio sensors. Due to the hardware cost and the deployment area limitation of the radio sensors, the spacial sampling rate of radio of a radio map is usually less than 1% in practical systems [11]. This means that over 99% of the information needed for a radio map cannot be directly obtained through radio sensing techniques. Second, the effective bandwidth of a radio map is determined by the working bandwidth of the radio sensors. In order to obtain the radio map that contains the signal information of common wireless systems, ranging from very low frequency (VLF)"}, {"title": "B. Related Works and Our Contribution", "content": "One of the most common way for radio map generation is the channel model based method. According to general rules of radio signal propagation, path loss is often modeled using variations of log-normal shadowing models, such as the 3GPP model described in [16]. Given the location and configuration of transmitters, a radio map can be generated based on the adopted channel model. Works such as [17]\u2013[19] adopted channel model based radio map dataset generation and trained their generative models accordingly for radio map construction. Although the channel model-based approach is relatively easy to implement, it often lacks consistency with realistic scenarios for disregarding the radio wave propagation characteristic in specific environment along specific paths.\nWhile the channel model-based method provides a rough estimation of radio propagation, the ray-tracing method offers a more precise and site-specific approach [20]. This method simulates electromagnetic waves as rays radiating from the transmitter in a finely detailed space. These rays interact with objects in the environment, accounting for reflections and potentially even diffraction or transmission [21]. Finally, the rays reaching the receiver are combined to calculate path loss or other channel information. Recently, emerging studies have been adopting the ray- tracing method for more precise radio map dataset generation. For instance, the Radio MapSeer proposed in [2], which contains 56,000 two-dimension (2D) radio maps in urban scenario.\nAlthough ray-tracing for radio map generation is highly precise, its computational cost is extremely high due to the complex calculations involving massive transmission rays. Recently, several commercial simulation platforms for ray-tracing simulations have been developed to"}, {"title": "A.

Dataset Properties", "content": "In this part, we introduce the properties of the SpectrumNet dataset. Table II shows the parameters of the samples in the SpectrumNet dataset. OpenStreetMap [26] is used to obtain real-world building maps of 15300 different areas. The size of each area is 1.28km \u00d7 1.28km in the x-y plane, with a spacial resolution of 10m, resulting in radio map images of size 128 \u00d7 128. The radio maps are provided at three different heights for each area: 1.5m, 30m, and 200m above the ground, reflecting the radio maps for ground nodes, nodes in buildings, and aerial nodes, respectively. In order to illustrate full band radio propagation, radio maps of five different frequencies ranging from 150 MHz to 22GHz are included, which cover most of the working frequencies of wireless networks. Additionally, the variation of scenarios corresponds to different climates, building materials, and terrain materials, which also affect radio propagation in real world. Therefore, these parameters are also annotated for the generation of every radio map.

As mentioned above, different scenarios have various parameters in terms of terrain materials, object materials, and geographical characteristics. In what follows, we briefly introduce the features of each terrain scenario in SpectrumNet.\n(1) Dense urban: Dense urban areas are characterized by a high density of tall buildings and streets, such as downtown New York City shown in Fig. 1 (a). These areas feature a significant number of rays reflecting and refracting off surfaces. The material of buildings can be cement, marble, glass, and plywood, while the terrain material is mostly cement.\n(2) Ordinary urban: Ordinary urban areas have a lower density of buildings, and the buildings are shorter compared to those in dense urban areas.

EXPERIMENTS ON GENERATIVE MODELS FOR RADIO MAP CONSTRUCTION", "content": "In this section, we present baseline methods for constructing radio maps using the Spectrum- Net dataset. We evaluate the performance of these methods across various terrain scenarios, heights, and frequencies, and discuss the generalization of models trained on the SpectrumNet dataset. Three baseline methods are employed: UNet [27], CBAM [28], and an interpolation algorithm [29]. The three baseline methods cover the main research directions of radio map con- structions. UNet and CBAM represent generative model-driven radio map construction methods based on convolutional neural network and Transformer, respectively; while interpolation is a representative wireless channel-driven radio map construction method.\nWe randomly select 50 sampling points as input for radio map construction, with the goal of generating a 128 \u00d7 128 radio map, resulting in a sampling rate of 0.3%. For the first two generative model-driven methods, the input comprises three channels: RSS, terrain altitude, and"}, {"title": "A. Radio Map Construction in Various Terrain Scenarios", "content": "In this part, we evaluate the performance of radio map generation across various terrain scenarios, with results presented in Table IV. The performance metrics, i.e., SSIM, PSNR, and RMSE, generally show consistent trends: higher SSIM values typically correspond to higher PSNR and lower RMSE values. However, the effectiveness of the baseline methods varies significantly depending on the terrain scenarios. Radio maps generated for ocean scenarios, where the terrain is flat and devoid of buildings, achieve the best performance. Conversely, scenarios with complex terrain or numerous buildings and objects, such as dense urban, suburban, and forest areas, yield lower performance with the baseline methods, indicating a need for further research on generative models for radio map construction. Among the baseline methods, CBAM outperforms the others in most cases, highlighting the superiority of this generative model in radio map applications. The performance of UNet and the interpolation algorithm is comparable, with UNet slightly better in PSNR, while the interpolation algorithm performs marginally better in SSIM and RMSE.\nFor better illustration, we provide two examples of radio map generation in dense urban and mountainous scenarios, shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. In each figure, the first subfigure displays the ground truth (GT) of the radio map. The second, third, and forth subfigures show the input information of the sampling points: RSS, terrain altitudes, and building information, respectively. The fifth subfigure presents the radio map generated by the CBAM method.

Multiband Radio Map Construction", "content": "In this part, we evaluate radio map construction across different frequencies. Table VI presents the performance results for five distinct frequency bands. Constructing radio maps for high- frequency networks is notably more challenging than for low-frequency networks, particularly in terms of the SSIM metric. This difficulty arises from the physical characteristics of radio propagation. High-frequency signals experience more severe attenuation due to transmission and reflection by terrain and buildings, making it harder to accurately construct radio maps in environments with complex terrain and building structures. Consequently, further research is urgently needed to develop generative models capable of effectively handling radio map construction in high-frequency networks.\nFig. 10 and Fig. 11 provide examples of radio map construction in networks operating at 150 MHz and 22 GHz, respectively. It is evident that terrain and buildings exert a more pronounced shadowing effect on the high-frequency network in Fig. 11, compared to the low-frequency network in Fig. 10.

Discussions on Generalization", "content": "In this part, we evaluate the generalization of the baseline methods on the SpectrumNet dataset across various terrain scenarios and frequency bands.\n1) Generalization in Different Terrain Scenarios: To evaluate the generalization of the baseline methods across different terrain scenarios, we train three UNet models and three CBAM models using radio maps of lake, dense urban, and mountainous scenarios, respectively. The performance of these models in constructing radio maps across various terrain scenarios is presented in Table VII, Table VIII, and Table IX, respectively.\nFor radio map construction in each terrain scenario, the best-performing model is the one trained on data from the identical terrain scenario. Models trained on data from more complex scenarios, such as dense urban and mountainous, exhibit better generalization than those trained on simpler scenarios, like lakes. To improve the minimum performance of radio map construction across various scenarios, it is essential to include more data from complex scenarios in the training set.\n2) Generalization in Different Frequencies: We then evaluate generalization across different frequencies by training two UNet models and two CBAM models on radio maps from 150 MHz and 22 GHz networks, respectively.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORKS FOR DATASET EXPANSION", "content": "In this section, we discuss future works on expanding the SpectrumNet dataset, and the extended applications of generative AI with the SpectrumNet dataset.\n1) Spacial Expansion: The projection area of the samples in the current version of the SpectrumNet dataset is 1.28km \u00d7 1.28km, which is insufficient to accommodate the radio maps of networks with large cell radius, e.g. multimedia broadcast multicast service networks, where the cell radius can exceed 2km [30]. In future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset, the sample area can be expanded to 5km \u00d7 5km while maintaining the same resolution. This expansion will allow generative models for radio map construction to learn the spatial correlation knowledge of networks with large cell radius.\n2) Full Band Dataset Construction: Although the current version of the SpectrumNet dataset contains multiple working frequencies, the frequency domain resolution is relatively low com- pared to the granularity of spectrum resource allocation. Future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset will provide higher resolution in the frequency domain, encompassing all commonly used bands for wireless networks.\n3) Time Domain Dataset Construction: Radio map data exhibits time domain correlation in terms of transmitter location, transmission power, climate parameters, etc. However, all existing radio map datasets omit this correlation. In future versions of the SpectrumNet dataset, multiple radio maps in consecutive time slots will be included. This time domain correlation can be utilized to train generative models for predicting the track of moving transmitters, the power variation of each transmitter, and the change in climate parameters.

In this part, we discuss several research directions on generative model for radio map construction using the SpectrumNet dataset.\n1) Generative Model Enhancement: When comparing the performance of generative models for radio map construction in Section III with the works on other datasets [2], [24], [25], we find that the baseline models cannot provide high accuracy radio map construction for multiband 3D scenario with terrain information. Therefore, designing training methods for generative models with the SpectrumNet dataset is necessary and can be explored in the following ways:\n1) Model scale extension: As mentioned above, the parameters and dimensions of the Spec- trumNet dataset are much larger than other existing radio map datasets [2], [24], [25]. It is very difficult for models of comparable scale to those in [2], [24], [25] to learn the extensive knowledge embedded within the SpectrumNet dataset. In order to train a high accuracy generative model for radio map construction based on the SpectrumNet, the model scale should be enhanced.\n2) Model framework design: Most of the current works on radio map construction utilize generative model frameworks from other visual tasks, such as UNet [27], MAE [35], etc."}, {"title": "V.

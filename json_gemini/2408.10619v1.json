Conventional change detection techniques, such as image differencing and ratioing, often struggle with noise and fail to capture complex variations in imagery. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly generative models like diffusion models, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the strengths of Stable Diffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to create robust and interpretable change maps. Our approach, named Diffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world remote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing techniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios with complex changes and noise.

Introduction", "content": "Change detection in remote sensing involves comparing two or more satellite images taken at different times to identify changes in the observed scene. This capability is vital for various applications, including environmental monitoring, urban expansion analysis, disaster management, and land use classification (Coppin et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2004). The challenge lies in accurately distinguishing between genuine changes and artifacts caused by noise, lighting variations, or seasonal differences.\n\nTraditional change detection methods, such as image differencing, ratioing, and thresholding, are widely used due to their simplicity and computational efficiency. However, these methods often produce high false positive rates, particularly in complex environments where changes are subtle or affected by external factors (Singh, 1989; Radke et al., 2005).\n\nRecent advancements in machine learning have led to the development of more sophisticated change detection techniques.

These techniques are straightforward and easy to implement but are highly sensitive to noise and require careful calibration to achieve acceptable results (Lu et al., 2004). Image differencing, for example, simply subtracts the pixel values of two co-registered images, resulting in a difference map that highlights changes (Singh, 1989). However, this approach is prone to false positives due to sensor noise, lighting changes, and seasonal variations (Coppin et al., 2004)."}, {"title": "2.2 Machine Learning-Based Approaches", "content": "The application of machine learning to change detection has gained traction in recent years. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been employed to learn feature representations from image pairs, enabling more accurate change detection (Chen et al., 2020). Siamese networks, which consist of two identical networks with shared weights, have been particularly successful in learning to identify changes between image pairs (Daudt et al., 2018). However, these models often require large labeled datasets for training and may struggle to generalize to new environments.\n\nGenerative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have also been explored for change detection (Zhu et al., 2017). These models can synthesize potential changes and train a discriminator to identify real changes. While effective, GANs are computationally intensive and can be difficult to train, often requiring careful tuning and extensive computational resources."}, {"title": "2.3 Diffusion Models", "content": "Diffusion models are a class of generative models that generate data by reversing a diffusion process, which gradually adds noise to the data (Ho et al., 2020). Stable Diffusion, a variant of diffusion models, has demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-quality images and is gaining popularity in the machine learning community. These models have the potential to enhance change detection by capturing complex changes that traditional methods might miss (Dhariwal & Nichol, 2021)."}, {"title": "2.4 Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)", "content": "The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is a perceptual metric for assessing image quality by comparing the structural information between two images (Wang et al., 2004). Unlike pixel-wise difference metrics, SSIM considers luminance, contrast, and structural similarity, making it more robust to changes that do not alter the overall structure of the scene. SSIM has been widely used in image quality assessment but has only recently been explored in the context of change detection (Zhou et al., 2019)."}, {"title": "3. Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.1 Diffusion-Based Change Detection", "content": "Our proposed framework, Diffusion Based Change Detector, leverages the Stable Diffusion model to enhance the accuracy of change detection. Diffusion models work by progressively refining noise to generate realistic images, and in our framework, we use this capability to model changes between two images.\n\nThe process begins with two co-registered images taken at different times. These images are passed through the Stable Diffusion model, which is trained to generate the second image from the first image and a noise vector. The generated image is then compared to the actual second image to identify areas of significant change.\n\nThe diffusion model allows us to capture fine-grained details that are often missed by traditional differencing methods. By modeling the generative process of change, the diffusion model can distinguish between actual changes and noise or irrelevant variations, leading to more accurate change detection."}, {"title": "3.2 SSIM-Based Change Map", "content": "The novelty of our approach lies in the integration of the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as the change detection map. After generating the refined image using the diffusion model, we compute the SSIM between the generated image and the actual second image. The SSIM map highlights regions with perceptual differences, which correspond to actual changes in the scene.\n\nUnlike traditional difference maps that rely on pixel-wise differences, SSIM considers perceptual changes that affect the structure of the image. This makes SSIM more robust to noise and irrelevant changes, leading to more accurate and interpretable change maps. The combination of SSIM with the generative power of diffusion models represents a significant advancement over existing change detection techniques."}, {"title": "4.

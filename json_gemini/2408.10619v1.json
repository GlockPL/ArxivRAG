Conventional change detection techniques, such\nas image differencing and ratioing, often struggle with noise and fail to capture complex\nvariations in imagery. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly generative models\nlike diffusion models, offer new opportunities for enhancing change detection accuracy. In this\npaper, we propose a novel change detection framework that combines the strengths of Stable\nDiffusion models with the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to create robust and interpretable\nchange maps. Our approach, named Diffusion Based Change Detector, is evaluated on both\nsynthetic and real-world remote sensing datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods.\nThe results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional differencing\ntechniques and recent deep learning-based methods, particularly in scenarios with complex\nchanges and noise.

Business Process Management (BPM) is the main element to regulate and govern\nthis integration because boosting efficiency in any organization often necessitates changing its processes in\naccordance with an informed perspective (Powell et al., 2001). BPM can be described in numerous ways\nbut to be concise and clear, it involves the analysis and diagnosis of process shortcomings, the redesign of\nthe process, and the implementation of corrective measures (Luo and Chen, 2011). Analysis and diagnosis\nshare a common essence, as both require a comprehensive study and data analysis to identify deficiencies\nand develop a roadmap. Redesign and implementation involve tangible actions that actively focus on how\nto rearticulate and rearrange a process in terms of its dependent and independent tasks and resources based\non the analysis (Mustansir et al., 2022). Once the process evaluation and planning are established, process\nimprovement can be pursued (Urh et al., 2019).\nIn summary, BPM consists of two main components: (1) process enhancement, which involves monitoring\nand evaluating the current process to diagnose inefficiencies, and (2) process improvement, which includes\nredesigning the process and implementing corrective actions based on the preceding analysis. For clarity, in\nthe scholarly literature, the term \u201cpredictive business process monitoring\" is commonly used to describe pro-\ncess enhancement through the application of predictive analytics to business processes based on historical data."}, {"title": "1.1 Process Improvement", "content": "Many surveys seek to find solutions to handle challenges including insufficient BPM knowledge in educa-\ntion (Seethamraju, 2012), in IT sector (Alotaibi and Liu, 2017) as a critical enabler in process improvement.\nChange management, resulting from the implementation of process improvement methods, presents an addi-\ntional challenge in this context. Sujov\u00e1 and Reme\u0148 (2018) investigated the impact of various methods and also\nprovided an overview of how businesses dealt with the transitions in the process.\nAccording to the reviews, there is a variety of factors including people and tools that contribute to the\nsuccess of a BPI project. Process owners as a prominent part of process improvement methods have been in-\nvestigated in (Danilova, 2019), specifically with regard to elucidating stakeholders' roles, responsibilities, and\nthe required characteristics of the team to have a successful improvement strategy. Also, Arias et al. (2018b)\nplaced emphasis on human resources within the context of BPM and thus they evaluated papers to identify\nthe approaches, business drivers, issues, and challenges in human resource allocation. In addition, Pourmirza\net al. (2017) believes BPMS (business process management system) is a crucial element in achieving excel-\nlence in business process management. Therefore, they reviewed around 600 papers to classify and analyze\nthe different BPMS architectures and eventually, they introduced 41 different architectures that could be ap-\nplicable in this context. Furthermore, the significance of culture has been underscored by vom Brocke and\nSinnl (2011) as a facilitator for ensuring the effectiveness of employing the BPI method in an organization.\nThey have elaborated the frame of reference regarding culture's role and influences through their scholarly\nworks. Besides, surveys dedicated attention to the exploration of digital innovation (Ahmad and Looy, 2020)\nand blockchain (Viriyasitavat et al., 2022; Taherdoost and Madanchian, 2024) as an advantageous tool.\nDuring the past few decades, there has been a noticeable change in methodologies, coinciding with the big\ndata age and developments in databases.

If the process model is provided this capability can be used to modify or\nextend the existing model. Extending a process model with performance data, identifying bottlenecks, or\ndetecting deviations are examples of this capability. The insights obtained in this step fuel the suggestions\nof business process analysts and process owners to change the process. Finally, process enhancement can be\nused to track processes over time and assist in continuous improvement (van der Aalst et al., 2011). On the\nother hand, process enhancement specifically provides process improvement recommendations based on the\nmetrics (e.g., remaining process time, waiting time) and helps with the root-cause analysis and according to this\ninformation using event logs, improvements or changes can be made. On the other hand, BPI (business process\nimprovement) consists of techniques and approaches (e.g., Six Sigma, Lean, etc.) to increase the effectiveness\nand efficiency of the actual business processes that provide output to internal and external customers. For\nthis, there are various techniques to find improvement opportunities and implement corrective actions. Process\nenhancement is one of the methods that play a role in introducing improvement opportunities and developing\nthe roadmap for BPI (van der Aalst, 2016).\nIt should be noted that this paper focuses on organizations that have modeled their own processes (current\nsituation); however, they aim to improve their business processes derived from the event logs and process data.\nTo be more specific, different process properties, including the goals of the process, the desired output, and the\ncurrent process model, have been developed. However, the business wants to find and implement corrective\nactions to enhance efficiency.\nProcess enhancement is a relatively nascent area, resulting in a more limited collection of review papers\ncompared to the longer-standing area of process improvement. However, scholars have demonstrated the ca-\npacity of process enhancement across various applications and industries. In particular, (Rojas et al., 2016;\nWilliams et al., 2018) conducted a comprehensive review of scholarly papers on healthcare processes, high-\nlighting specific approaches within this crucial sector.\nGoal-oriented process enhancement is another area of interest among researchers, particularly in reviews"}, {"title": "1.3 Research Questions", "content": "The main purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive analysis of the academic literature on business\nprocess improvement, process enhancement, and integrated methodologies with a specific focus on the appli-\ncation of AI and machine learning techniques.

Similarly, anomalies are characterized by sudden disruptions in processes and demand\nimmediate attention as they can impede process function(Huo et al., 2021).\nIt is important to note that, drift and anomaly detection are firmly established in quality management\npractices and concepts, and these notions have witnessed a notable surge in scholarly investigations of business\nprocesses in recent academic literature.\nWith respect to this issue, Cattafi et al. (2010) proposed a solution to consider this in the process of inves-\ntigating the predictive performance of the process. To address this, they adapt IDPML (Inductive Declarative\nProcess Model Learner) process mining system to create a transition system using annotations. They employed\nthe ILP (Inductive Logic Programming), which combines machine learning and logic programming, to detect\nchanges and identify improvement opportunities as new information becomes available. They believe that re-\nliance on historical process data alone is inefficient. Therefore, they divided the process trace into positive and\nnegative instances. This separation allows them to use the first subset to train a model and establish the normal\nstructure, while the second subset is used to design the process revision system. On the other hand, Luengo\nand Sep\u00falveda (2012) presented an alternative approach to this challenge by applying a clustering method to\naddress the problem. In their article, they offered a method for clustering data that considers the start time of\nprocess instances along with other features. The clusters, created by combining control-flow and time charac-\nteristics, exhibit both temporal closeness and structural similarity. As a result, the process model developed for\neach cluster can reflect a unique variation of the business process.\nThe challenges in gaining insights from the mined models and understanding the findings have not been\nfully addressed in the health sector. This makes it difficult for health practitioners to apply process mining in-\nsights and business process analysis, resulting in the underuse of process mining. An approach for these areas\nto enhance their processes is cross-organizational mining and comparative study of processes. A case study\nby Partington et al. (2015) presents an examination of how healthcare data and cross-organizational compar-\nisons can be used by process mining tools. They presented findings from a comparative process mining case\nstudy using data regularly collected to identify variations in healthcare delivery at four hospitals in Australia.\nIn another work, in order to reveal behavioral changes, Hompes et al. (2017) introduced a comparative case\nclustering approach. Identifying moments in time when behavior changes and understanding the causes of\nthose changes can provide valuable insights and lead to process improvements.

(2011) offered a\ncustomizable method for building a process model, enhancing this model with time data gleaned from prior\ninstances. They employed a set of adaptable abstractions in insurance process cases to produce meaningful\ntemporal prediction by striking a compromise between \u201coverfitting\u201d and \u201cunderfitting", "black-box\" strategy since they only predict a single scalar result without\nbreaking it down into simpler parts.\nA white-box strategy is suggested in (Verenich et al., 2019) to predict performance metrics of running\nprocess instances. The basic concept is to predict the performance indicator at the level of the activities first,\nand then, using flow analysis techniques, to aggregate these predictions at the level of a process instance.\nTo put it another way, the research described here aims to make use of the concept of decompositional\nexplanation. These models help process workers and management understands where the remaining time will\nbe spent in the process. In order to improve the performance and accuracy of remaining-time prediction,\nWahid et al.

Facilitating the process with this valuable and informative insight would enhance operational\nclarity (Taymouri et al., 2020).\nThere are a number of deep learning architectures that have been extensively studied in machine learning\nthat may be examined as alternatives. They used convolutional neural networks to give the execution scenario of\na business process the ability to predict the following action in a running trace. Pasquadibisceglie et al. (2019)\nhave explored the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which represent a robust class of DNNS\nwidely used in computer vision and speech recognition. The fundamental concept is to consider the temporal\ndata included in the historical event log of a business process as pictures by converting them into spatial data.\nTo do this, each event log trace is first converted into the collection of its prefix traces (i.e. sequences of events\nthat represent the prefix of a trace). These prefix traces are translated into data structures resembling 2D images.\nFinally, the created spatial data is utilized to train a Convolutional Neural Network in order to construct a deep\nlearning model capable of predicting the next activity (i.e., the activity associated with the event occurring after\nthe last event in the considered prefix trace). In another study, Pasquadibisceglie et al.

In the process execution,\ndecisions are made at various points to satisfy these constraints. As a result, it is critical for process stakehold-\ners to receive predictions on whether the restrictions will be met,along with suggestions on the options that\noptimize the chances of meeting the business requirements (Poll et al., 2018).\nIn this context, Maggi et al. (2014) present Predictive Business Process Monitoring, a novel framework\nbased on Linear Temporal Logic. This framework continuously generates predictions and recommendations\non what activities to perform and what input data values to provide, to determine the likelihood of business con-\nstraints being violated. They define a data snapshot as a positive or negative example, depending on whether\nthe constraint was subsequently met in the entire trace. In this method, they translate the prediction problem\ninto a classification challenge, where the aim is to assess whether and with what probability a particular data\nsnapshot leads to business constraint fulfillment. Finally, they use decision tree learning to address the classi-\nfication issue, producing a decision tree to differentiate between fulfillment and violations. For each potential\ncombination of input attribute values, the decision tree is used to predict the chance that the business constraint\nwill be met.\nUsing event log data from activities to make the prediction gives adequate information and decreases the\ncomputing cost, whereas prior studies only received a process model with the sequence of events as input,\nresulting in information loss. To solve this, M\u00e1rquez-Chamorro et al. (2017) suggest an evolutionary decision\nrule-based system for the prediction of business process indicators. This method's encoding is based on the\nevent properties that were taken from the event logs. A prediction of a certain process indicator is made using\nthe decision rules. Using both next-event and end-of-instance predictions, this system can predict instance-level\nindicators.\nAnother challenge in this context is the substantial runtime expense, which makes it impractical in envi-\nronments with high throughput or where rapid reaction times are necessary. Francescomarino et al. (2019)\npropose a predictive process monitoring approach for calculating the probability that a particular predicate will\nbe satisfied by the end of a running case. The system considers both the sequence of events in the current\ntrace and the data properties related to these events. By building the classifiers offline, it achieves a reasonably\nminimal runtime cost. The prediction problem is tackled in two steps. First, prefixes of prior (completed)\ninstances are clustered based on control flow knowledge. Second, a classifier is created for each cluster using"}, {"title": "3.5 Performance", "content": "In order to support proactive steps that will enhance the process execution, it should be emphasized that it is\nmore feasible to predict the performance of processes at the level of the process model and identify possible\nweaknesses in the process (Park and Song, 2020).

Within these cat-\negories, we defined different objectives that the papers focused on and explained them in the corresponding\nsubsections. We also clarified whether each paper included a case study and where it was implemented.

Moreover, the business landscape has witnessed continuous transformation, closely intertwined with technological advancements. Our main goal is to offer researchers and process analysts insights into the latest developments concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to optimize their processes in an organization and identify research gaps and future directions in the field.\nDesign/methodology/approach- In this study, we perform a systematic review of academic literature to investigate the integration of AI/ML in business process management (BPM). We categorize the literature according to the BPM life-cycle and employ bibliometric and objective-oriented methodology, to analyze related papers.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction and Theoretical Background", "content": "The efficient operation of a corporation relies on the seamless integration of people and business processes to obtain desired outcomes. Business Process Management (BPM) is the main element to regulate and govern this integration because boosting efficiency in any organization often necessitates changing its processes in accordance with an informed perspective (Powell et al., 2001). BPM can be described in numerous ways but to be concise and clear, it involves the analysis and diagnosis of process shortcomings, the redesign of the process, and the implementation of corrective measures (Luo and Chen, 2011). Analysis and diagnosis share a common essence, as both require a comprehensive study and data analysis to identify deficiencies and develop a roadmap. Redesign and implementation involve tangible actions that actively focus on how to rearticulate and rearrange a process in terms of its dependent and independent tasks and resources based on the analysis (Mustansir et al., 2022). Once the process evaluation and planning are established, process improvement can be pursued (Urh et al., 2019).\nIn summary, BPM consists of two main components: (1) process enhancement, which involves monitoring and evaluating the current process to diagnose inefficiencies, and (2) process improvement, which includes redesigning the process and implementing corrective actions based on the preceding analysis. For clarity, in the scholarly literature, the term \u201cpredictive business process monitoring\" is commonly used to describe process enhancement through the application of predictive analytics to business processes based on historical data."}, {"title": "1.1 Process Improvement", "content": "Many surveys seek to find solutions to handle challenges including insufficient BPM knowledge in education (Seethamraju, 2012), in IT sector (Alotaibi and Liu, 2017) as a critical enabler in process improvement. Change management, resulting from the implementation of process improvement methods, presents an additional challenge in this context. Sujov\u00e1 and Reme\u0148 (2018) investigated the impact of various methods and also provided an overview of how businesses dealt with the transitions in the process.\nAccording to the reviews, there is a variety of factors including people and tools that contribute to the success of a BPI project. Process owners as a prominent part of process improvement methods have been investigated in (Danilova, 2019), specifically with regard to elucidating stakeholders' roles, responsibilities, and the required characteristics of the team to have a successful improvement strategy. Also, Arias et al. (2018b) placed emphasis on human resources within the context of BPM and thus they evaluated papers to identify the approaches, business drivers, issues, and challenges in human resource allocation. In addition, Pourmirza et al. (2017) believes BPMS (business process management system) is a crucial element in achieving excellence in business process management. Therefore, they reviewed around 600 papers to classify and analyze the different BPMS architectures and eventually, they introduced 41 different architectures that could be applicable in this context. Furthermore, the significance of culture has been underscored by vom Brocke and Sinnl (2011) as a facilitator for ensuring the effectiveness of employing the BPI method in an organization. They have elaborated the frame of reference regarding culture's role and influences through their scholarly works. Besides, surveys dedicated attention to the exploration of digital innovation (Ahmad and Looy, 2020) and blockchain (Viriyasitavat et al., 2022; Taherdoost and Madanchian, 2024) as an advantageous tool.\nDuring the past few decades, there has been a noticeable change in methodologies, coinciding with the big data age and developments in databases. These advances have made it much easier for improvement teams to"}, {"title": "1.2 Process Enhancement", "content": "Process enhancement is one of the three main attributes of process mining (i.e., (a) discovery, (b) conformance checking, and (c) enhancement). If the process model is provided this capability can be used to modify or extend the existing model. Extending a process model with performance data, identifying bottlenecks, or detecting deviations are examples of this capability. The insights obtained in this step fuel the suggestions of business process analysts and process owners to change the process. Finally, process enhancement can be used to track processes over time and assist in continuous improvement (van der Aalst et al., 2011). On the other hand, process enhancement specifically provides process improvement recommendations based on the metrics (e.g., remaining process time, waiting time) and helps with the root-cause analysis and according to this information using event logs, improvements or changes can be made. On the other hand, BPI (business process improvement) consists of techniques and approaches (e.g., Six Sigma, Lean, etc.) to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the actual business processes that provide output to internal and external customers. For this, there are various techniques to find improvement opportunities and implement corrective actions. Process enhancement is one of the methods that play a role in introducing improvement opportunities and developing the roadmap for BPI (van der Aalst, 2016).\nIt should be noted that this paper focuses on organizations that have modeled their own processes (current situation); however, they aim to improve their business processes derived from the event logs and process data. To be more specific, different process properties, including the goals of the process, the desired output, and the current process model, have been developed. However, the business wants to find and implement corrective actions to enhance efficiency.\nProcess enhancement is a relatively nascent area, resulting in a more limited collection of review papers compared to the longer-standing area of process improvement. However, scholars have demonstrated the capacity of process enhancement across various applications and industries. In particular, (Rojas et al., 2016;\nWilliams et al., 2018) conducted a comprehensive review of scholarly papers on healthcare processes, highlighting specific approaches within this crucial sector.\nGoal-oriented process enhancement is another area of interest among researchers, particularly in reviews"}, {"title": "1.3 Research Questions", "content": "The main purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive analysis of the academic literature on business process improvement, process enhancement, and integrated methodologies with a specific focus on the application of AI and machine learning techniques. This paper defines its scope to assist business process experts in identifying organization-specific and feasible Business Process Management (BPM) solutions, particularly in light of recent AI advancements. The aim is to introduce this evolving field to BPM analysts, aiding them in adapting to these emerging technological changes. It is important to introduce this area to BPM analyst to help them to adapt with these changes. Additionally, as businesses increasingly seek integrated solutions for process enhancement and improvement, a growing body of research has emerged to address this need. These papers not only identify process shortcomings but also aim to enhance processes to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. In this review paper, we aim to examine these methods, approaches, and contributions in comparison to traditional models.\nTackling the two aforementioned gaps, we focus on the following research questions.\nRQ1: In light of advancements in AI and machine learning in recent years, what is the impact of these developments on process improvement and process enhancement and how do researchers employ AI and machine learning to advance the field of BPM?\nRQ2: What approaches have been introduced in the literature that address the integration of process enhancement and process improvement?\nRQ3: Are there differences in the manner in which an organization employs process enhancement and process improvement techniques as separate entities compared to when they adopt integrated approaches?"}, {"title": "2 Research design and methodology", "content": "As it is shown in Figure 2, this paper introduces a 6-step framework designed to effectively address research questions, achieve desired objectives, and follow systematic research review methodologies, such as PRISMA.

Similarly, anomalies are characterized by sudden disruptions in processes and demand immediate attention as they can impede process function(Huo et al., 2021).\nIt is important to note that, drift and anomaly detection are firmly established in quality management practices and concepts, and these notions have witnessed a notable surge in scholarly investigations of business processes in recent academic literature.\nWith respect to this issue, Cattafi et al. (2010) proposed a solution to consider this in the process of investigating the predictive performance of the process. To address this, they adapt IDPML (Inductive Declarative Process Model Learner) process mining system to create a transition system using annotations. They employed the ILP (Inductive Logic Programming), which combines machine learning and logic programming, to detect changes and identify improvement opportunities as new information becomes available. They believe that reliance on historical process data alone is inefficient. Therefore, they divided the process trace into positive and negative instances. This separation allows them to use the first subset to train a model and establish the normal structure, while the second subset is used to design the process revision system. On the other hand, Luengo and Sep\u00falveda (2012) presented an alternative approach to this challenge by applying a clustering method to address the problem. In their article, they offered a method for clustering data that considers the start time of process instances along with other features. The clusters, created by combining control-flow and time characteristics, exhibit both temporal closeness and structural similarity. As a result, the process model developed for each cluster can reflect a unique variation of the business process.\nThe challenges in gaining insights from the mined models and understanding the findings have not been fully addressed in the health sector. This makes it difficult for health practitioners to apply process mining insights and business process analysis, resulting in the underuse of process mining. An approach for these areas to enhance their processes is cross-organizational mining and comparative study of processes. A case study by Partington et al. (2015) presents an examination of how healthcare data and cross-organizational comparisons can be used by process mining tools. They presented findings from a comparative process mining case study using data regularly collected to identify variations in healthcare delivery at four hospitals in Australia.\nIn another work, in order to reveal behavioral changes, Hompes et al. (2017) introduced a comparative case clustering approach. Identifying moments in time when behavior changes and understanding the causes of those changes can provide valuable insights and lead to process improvements. Comparing the clustering of"}, {"title": "3.2 Time Remaining or Completion Time", "content": "Predicting the remaining time of ongoing processes enables and empowers businesses to identify high-risk processes that may not align with certain criteria, thereby equipping case managers with insights for well-informed decisions and timely intervention (Evermann et al., 2017). van der Aalst et al. (2011) offered a customizable method for building a process model, enhancing this model with time data gleaned from prior instances. They employed a set of adaptable abstractions in insurance process cases to produce meaningful temporal prediction by striking a compromise between \u201coverfitting\u201d and \u201cunderfitting\". However, these models do not describe how the predicted remaining time will be used.\nIn reality, these methods use a \u201cblack-box\" strategy since they only predict a single scalar result without breaking it down into simpler parts.\nA white-box strategy is suggested in (Verenich et al., 2019) to predict performance metrics of running process instances. The basic concept is to predict the performance indicator at the level of the activities first, and then, using flow analysis techniques, to aggregate these predictions at the level of a process instance.\nTo put it another way, the research described here aims to make use of the concept of decompositional explanation. These models help process workers and management understands where the remaining time will be spent in the process. In order to improve the performance and accuracy of remaining-time prediction,\nWahid et al. (2019) suggested a Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm in the remaining time prediction issue incorporating categorical variables, which outperforms all baseline approaches used as a benchmark."}, {"title": "3.3 Next Activity of Running Process", "content": "Another parameter that is in the interest of process analysts is predicting the next most likely activity of running process instances. Facilitating the process with this valuable and informative insight would enhance operational clarity (Taymouri et al., 2020).\nThere are a number of deep learning architectures that have been extensively studied in machine learning that may be examined as alternatives. They used convolutional neural networks to give the execution scenario of a business process the ability to predict the following action in a running trace. Pasquadibisceglie et al. (2019) have explored the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which represent a robust class of DNNS widely used in computer vision and speech recognition. The fundamental concept is to consider the temporal data included in the historical event log of a business process as pictures by converting them into spatial data. To do this, each event log trace is first converted into the collection of its prefix traces (i.e. sequences of events that represent the prefix of a trace). These prefix traces are translated into data structures resembling 2D images. Finally, the created spatial data is utilized to train a Convolutional Neural Network in order to construct a deep learning model capable of predicting the next activity (i.e., the activity associated with the event occurring after the last event in the considered prefix trace). In another study, Pasquadibisceglie et al. (2020) departed from"}, {"title": "3.4 Business Constraints Monitoring", "content": "According to the studies, a business constraint is a condition imposed on the execution of a process that distinguishes compliance from non-compliant behavior (Pesic and van der Aalst, 2006). In the process execution, decisions are made at various points to satisfy these constraints. As a result, it is critical for process stakeholders to receive predictions on whether the restrictions will be met,along with suggestions on the options that optimize the chances of meeting the business requirements (Poll et al., 2018).\nIn this context, Maggi et al. (2014) present Predictive Business Process Monitoring, a novel framework based on Linear Temporal Logic. This framework continuously generates predictions and recommendations on what activities to perform and what input data values to provide, to determine the likelihood of business constraints being violated. They define a data snapshot as a positive or negative example, depending on whether the constraint was subsequently met in the entire trace. In this method, they translate the prediction problem into a classification challenge, where the aim is to assess whether and with what probability a particular data snapshot leads to business constraint fulfillment. Finally, they use decision tree learning to address the classification issue, producing a decision tree to differentiate between fulfillment and violations. For each potential combination of input attribute values, the decision tree is used to predict the chance that the business constraint will be met.\nUsing event log data from activities to make the prediction gives adequate information and decreases the computing cost, whereas prior studies only received a process model with the sequence of events as input, resulting in information loss. To solve this, M\u00e1rquez-Chamorro et al. (2017) suggest an evolutionary decision rule-based system for the prediction of business process indicators. This method's encoding is based on the event properties that were taken from the event logs. A prediction of a certain process indicator is made using the decision rules. Using both next-event and end-of-instance predictions, this system can predict instance-level indicators.\nAnother challenge in this context is the substantial runtime expense, which makes it impractical in environments with high throughput or where rapid reaction times are necessary. Francescomarino et al. (2019) propose a predictive process monitoring approach for calculating the probability that a particular predicate will be satisfied by the end of a running case. The system considers both the sequence of events in the current trace and the data properties related to these events. By building the classifiers offline, it achieves a reasonably minimal runtime cost. The prediction problem is tackled in two steps. First, prefixes of prior (completed) instances are clustered based on control flow knowledge. Second, a classifier is created for each cluster using"}, {"title": "3.5 Performance", "content": "In order to support proactive steps that will enhance the process execution, it should be emphasized that it is more feasible to predict the performance of processes at the level of the process model and identify possible weaknesses in the process (Park and Song, 2020). In order to achieve this, Park and Song (2020) present a unique approach to predict future business process performance at the level of the process model. They create performance prediction models based on DNN that take into account the temporal development and spatial dependency of the process model and produce a training set from the process representation matrix."}, {"title": "3.6 Multi Parameters", "content": "In some papers, the authors focus on process enhancement and consider different objectives. (e.g., remaining time, next activity, etc.). In order to predict sequences of upcoming events, their timestamps, and their associated resource pools, Camargo et al. (2019) suggested a method for training recurrent neural networks (RNN) with Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. In another work, Weinzierl et al. (2020) have used Deep Neural Network (DNN) to predict the remaining time and next activity.\nIn Table 4, we categorized papers on process enhancement into different goals: quality, time, cost, and flexibility. These are the main attributes that process analysts pursue in any BPM project. Within these categories, we defined different objectives that the papers focused on and explained them in the corresponding subsections. We also clarified whether each paper included a case study and where it was implemented. From this table, it is evident that flexibility has never been addressed as a goal, indicating a gap in the research. However, this is particularly significant in our fast-paced world with constant changes to the organization. Most papers have focused on quality, which is also a focal point of AI/ML projects. Having a case study proves to be a crucial factor in evaluating work in this field. Quality emerged as the most frequently pursued goal, with objectives such as drift detection and predicting the next activity receiving significant attention and favorable reviews. Conversely, objectives like detecting bottlenecks and enhancing customer satisfaction require further investigation. We also summarized the AI approaches utilized in the reviewed papers in Table 5. Clustering and neural network methods have been predominantly applied. However, there is a noticeable gap in the implementation of unsupervised learning and semi-supervised techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Zero-shot Learning (ZSL), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). This gap is particularly significant due to the challenges posed by event logs, which are often difficult to obtain and frequently contain interrupting incomplete traces. This represents a major issue within the field that warrants further exploration."}, {"title": "4 Process Improvement", "content": "As discussed earlier, process improvement is used to optimize time, cost, quality, and flexibility. It includes general methods including six sigma, company restructuring, core process redesign, and continuous improvement (Aladwani, 2001). It might be difficult for process analysts to decide which business analysis methods and techniques are best for identifying issues and guiding the choice of suitable analysis approaches (Zellner, 2013).\nAs mentioned previously, event logs are mined for non-trivial and practical information using process enhancement techniques. The goal of process improvement, on the other hand, is to find a solution to the problem of how to redesign the process so that business operations are effective and efficient. Understanding all components of the existing business process situation that are relevant to future process improvement is the overarching goal of process enhancement (Khosravi, 2016). Recent advances in research have made the fusion of these two approaches one of the most frequently employed areas of process analysis in enterprises, businesses, and governments (Song and Choi, 2011).\nAccording to the framework provided in (Grant, 2002), the business redesign includes five critical dimensions: (1) process/task, (2) technology, (3) people, (3) communication, and (4) organizational structure, which interact dynamically within the business. Each of these holds the potential for business improvement. Among them, within the process dimension, there are essential elements such as:\n1.  Activity Definition (Jablonski and Bussler, 1996) (identifying necessary tasks or steps to achieve the process goal, naming, and determining required actions in each step),\n2.  Resource Allocation and Scheduling (Alter, 1992) (selecting the most suitable resource for each step, and defining appropriate timing for tasks execution),\n3.  Process Objectives (Butler, 1996) (determining the desired output upon process completion),\n4.  Process Trigger (Hammer and Champy, 2009) (specific events that initiate the execution of a process (e.g., customer request or bug in software)),\n5.  Precedence and Dependency (Klein, 1995) (the sequence and interdependence of activities, defining the activity order),\nthat serve as potential focal points for researchers engaged in BPM projects (Seidmann and Sundararajan, 1997).\nGrant (2016) examined how these techniques for business process improvement might be used to help the creation of effective and efficient business processes.

In the context of business process management, pattern similarity plays a crucial role in the ongoing evaluation and comparison of a process against predefined benchmarks. This assessment occurs during the execution of the process, ensuring its efficiency can be measured reliably. Moreover, the process can be iteratively redesigned with targeted elements to achieve the ultimate objective (Sola et al., 2022). Indeed, pattern similarity can be acknowledged as a significant contribution of AI to the practice of benchmarking (Shafagatova and Van Looy, 2021).\nNiedermann et al. (2010) present an innovative approach for optimizing business processes at the design stage, rather than waiting until the implementation stage. The authors provide a comprehensive review of related work in the field, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches and the need for a more comprehensive solution. The proposed approach leverages machine learning techniques to identify optimization patterns in process models and match these patterns with similar patterns in a database of known patterns, providing a framework that consists of three main steps: identifying optimization patterns, matching process models, and applying optimization patterns. This paper contributes to the field of business process optimization by proposing a novel approach to optimize business processes at the design stage that can lead to significant improvements in performance and reduce the time and cost of process optimization.\nMaking informed decisions regarding the implementation of organizational changes or process-aware information systems (PAISs) requires a priori assessment of process improvement patterns (PIPs) for a particular"}, {"title": "4.2 Keyword Extraction", "content": "The present manual methods of business process redesign have the drawbacks of being time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error (Mustansir et al., 2022). In other work, by automating the improvements, Mustansir et al. (2022) want to increase the efficacy and efficiency of the redesign process. The NLP-based method for automatically extracting redesign recommendations for business processes is proposed in this research. The suggested method identifies sections of a business process that may be improved by combining many approaches, such as keyword extraction, dependency parsing, and semantic similarity metrics. This NLP-based method extracts suggestions for redesign from textual descriptions of business operations. The method's objective is to find process areas that can be improved, such as omitting redundant steps, streamlining communication, or cutting inefficiencies.\nIn knowledge-intensive processes characterized by high uncertainty in the execution of running processes, there exist multiple choices to transition a task to another activity. However, it is important to find the best suitable trace for the case to make it efficient and prevent waste or redundancy. In this way, Khandaker et al.

However, the application of deep learning in resource scheduling has witnessed considerable advancements in diverse domains, including production and project management, various approaches, such as rewriting logic (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2019), support vector machine (Denkena et al., 2016), etc., have been introduced to tackle resource scheduling in business domain (Wilmott, 2019). Reinforcement learning is an alternative approach that has been explored in the domain of business process cycle-time optimization. Firouzian et al. (2019) adopted an entropy-based learning approach, aimed at increasing task similarity during task assignment. The underlying reason contends that cycle time has a negative correlation with assigning similar tasks to the same resource. To fill the gap, an approach has been delivered, focusing on the analysis of business process provisioning under a resource prediction strategy based on LSTM (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2022). The proposed approach takes as input a BPMN process and a set of traces to train an LSTM model. By utilizing these inputs, the model predicts the optimal allocation and release of resources, aiming to optimize their utilization. This optimization can involve minimizing the idle time of resources or maximizing their usage across the business process while associated with the execution of the process.

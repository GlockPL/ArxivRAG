Traditionally, the process of designing airfoils has relied heavily on computationally intensive simulations to explore the vast design space [1,2]. This approach typically involves defining specific design parameters that can limit the ability to synthesize truly novel shapes [3]. As the demand for higher performance and more efficient aerodynamic structures increases, there is a growing need for advanced methodologies that can streamline the design process and facilitate the generation of innovative airfoil geometries [4].\nRecent advances in machine learning have opened new avenues for the design and optimization of complex systems [5]. Data-driven approaches, such as generative models, have shown promise in various fields by learning from existing data to generate new high-quality samples [6,7]. In the context of airfoil design, these models can potentially revolutionize the way we approach shape optimization by learning the underlying distribution of airfoil geometries and their aerodynamic properties [3,8,9].\nIn this work, we propose a novel methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion model. Using a pre-existing dataset of 2 dimensional airfoils, we train a diffusion model that synthesizes novel airfoil profiles.\nThe diffusion model, once trained, allows for the generation of new airfoil shapes from random vectors. This capability enables the synthesis of new airfoils that can be selected on the basis of desired Cl and Cd values or particular geometric criteria.

Traditional airfoil design has predominantly relied on computational simulations and fixed design parameters, which can restrict the exploration of innovative aerodynamic shapes [10]. These conventional methods, though effective in specific scenarios, often limit the ability to fully explore the expansive design space necessary for optimizing aerodynamic structures [4]. This limitation arises primarily from the need for predefining the design space using specific shape parameters, such as camber and thickness, which can constrain the range of possible geometries that can be considered during optimization.\nTo address these limitations, there has been a shift towards advanced machine learning techniques that allow for more flexible and efficient exploration of the design space. These approaches, including techniques like B\u00e9zier and B-spline parameterizations, offer greater control over airfoil geometry by representing shapes with a set of control points that can be adjusted to generate smooth and continuous surfaces. Such methods have been integrated into optimization frameworks to enhance the precision of geometric design while maintaining smoothness and manufacturability [11,12]. However, while these traditional geometric parameterizations provide a level of flexibility, they still require significant manual intervention and are often limited in handling highly complex shapes, especially in high-dimensional design spaces.\nThe introduction of data-driven methods, particularly deep learning models, has further advanced the field of geometry parameterization. By learning from large datasets of existing airfoil shapes, these models can generate new designs that meet specific aerodynamic performance criteria without being constrained by traditional shape parameters. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been particularly impactful in this domain. For example, the work by Li et al. [13] demonstrated the application of GANs to generate a diverse set of airfoil shapes by encoding them into a latent space, thereby enabling a more extensive exploration of the design space compared to traditional methods.\nMoreover, Diffusion Models, as explored in recent studies, represent a significant advancement in airfoil geometry parameterization. These models operate within a learned latent space, allowing for the generation of airfoil shapes with fewer training samples and maintaining high-quality outputs [14]. The ability of Diffusion Models to integrate specific design constraints directly into the generative process provides a powerful tool for optimizing aerodynamic shapes in a data-efficient manner.\nAs the field continues to evolve, hybrid approaches that combine traditional geometric parameterization with advanced machine learning techniques are emerging. These methods aim to leverage the strengths of both worlds-preserving the smoothness and manufacturability of traditional parameterizations while exploiting the flexibility and data-driven insights of deep learning models. The ongoing research in this area focuses on refining these techniques to accommodate increasingly complex aerodynamic and geometric constraints, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what is possible in airfoil design.\n2.2 Deep Learning Approaches. Generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown considerable promise in optimizing airfoil design by overcoming the limitations of traditional design methods. For instance, the Airfoil GAN model [3] encodes existing airfoil shapes into latent vectors, enabling the generation of novel airfoils with specific aerodynamic properties, without relying on predefined design parameters. This approach not only facilitates the exploration of high-dimensional design spaces but also integrates a genetic algorithm for optimizing aerodynamic performance, allowing the synthesized airfoils to evolve towards desired properties. Moreover, the model's ability to generate smooth and realistic airfoils directly from the latent space, coupled with its interpretability through feature clustering, sets it apart from traditional techniques. In comparison, the use of free-form deformation generalized adversarial networks (FFD-GAN) [8] has advanced the parameterization of three-dimensional aerodynamic shapes, yet it often requires predefined design formulations, limiting its flexibility in exploring novel geometries. The Airfoil GAN's potential for application to other aerodynamic and engineering domains further underscores its significance in the field of design optimization.\nDespite their potential, GAN-based methods often face challenges related to training stability and the need for large datasets. Addressing these issues, DiffAirfoil [15] introduces a novel approach that leverages a diffusion model within a learned latent space, specifically tailored for aerodynamic shape optimization. This model significantly enhances data efficiency, requiring substantially fewer training geometries compared to GANs, while still generating high-quality and diverse airfoil samples. The diffusion process not only ensures stable training and robust sampling, even under data-scarce conditions, but also mitigates the common pitfalls associated with adversarial training, such as mode collapse.\nMoreover, DiffAirfoil's conditional variant offers a distinct advantage in generating airfoils that meet specific geometric constraints without the need for retraining or model adjustments, thereby providing greater flexibility and efficiency in the design process. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where rapid design iterations are necessary, as it allows for the direct incorporation of user-defined constraints, such as maximum thickness or area, into the generated airfoil profiles.\nHowever, DiffAirfoil's approach is inherently tied to the use of a latent space for diffusion, where the model operates on latent vectors derived from an autodecoder. This methodology necessitates a template airfoil profile as a starting point, with the generated airfoils being deformed versions of this template, shaped according to the sampled latent vector. Although this approach is effective for optimizing and blending existing designs, it is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on predefined templates, which may limit the model's ability to fully explore the design space and discover novel and unconventional airfoil geometries.\nIn contrast, our work advances deep learning methodologies by proposing a conditional diffusion model that operates directly in the airfoil geometric space, without the need for latent space transformations or template geometries. By avoiding the constraints of template-based generation, our model focuses on the exploration of the design space rather than the optimization of existing designs. This approach enables our model to learn a comprehensive representation of the entire training dataset and generates airfoils that are not bound by the limitations of pre-existing shapes. Consequently, our model is more generalizable and capable of exploring a broader design space, offering greater flexibility in generating innovative airfoil geometries that might not be achievable through latent space diffusion models like DiffAirfoil."}, {"title": "3 Method", "content": "This section outlines the method for developing the airfoil diffusion model. The first subsection details the airfoil training dataset, including data processing for model training. The second subsection explores the method for obtaining airfoil performance measurements. The third subsection presents the background theory of diffusion models and the formulation of the airfoil diffusion model.\n3.1 Dataset. The UIUC Airfoil Database [16], hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, contains approximately 1600 airfoils, each represented by detailed coordinates.\nAirfoil profiles in the UIUC database consist of varying numbers of (x, y) coordinate pairs. However, neural networks require uniform input dimensions, necessitating a standardized number of data points across all samples. To address this, we repanelized the airfoil profiles using Aerosandbox [17], interpolating each sample to a consistent set of 200 points via cubic splines. This approach preserves the airfoil's shape and characteristics while ensuring uniform data representation.\nThe airfoils are normalized such that x-coordinates range from 0 to 1 and y-coordinates from -1 to 1. After repanelization, all samples share identical x-coordinates, effectively reducing the problem dimensionality from two to one dimension, which simplifies both training and generation processes.\nThe y-coordinate values are structured as follows: The first 100 points, corresponding to x-values decreasing from 1 to 0, represent the upper surface of the airfoil, while the last 100 points, corresponding to x-values increasing from 0 to 1, represent the lower surface. During training, we organize these y-values into two channels to help the model differentiate between the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoils.\n3.2 Obtaining Aerodynamic Coefficients. The performance of the airfoil is evaluated based on the lift and drag produced by the airfoil [18]. Lift is produced by the change in air velocity as it passes over the airfoil, while drag is created by skin friction and pressure changes due to flow separation and shocks [2].\n3.2.1 Airfoil Geometry. The lift and drag produced by an airfoil are directly related to the shape of its profile [2]. The chord length is the straight line distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the airfoil. The camber represents the curvature of the profile and is defined as the line passing through the center of the airfoil, equidistant from the upper and lower surfaces. The airfoil thickness ratio is an additional feature of airfoils and is derived from the chord length c and maximum thickness t of the airfoil [2]:\nAirfoil Thickness Ratio = $\\frac{t}{c}$\nThe angle of attack $\\alpha$ is the angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the vector representing the relative motion of the airfoil through the air. This angle influences the lift and drag experienced by the airfoil by affecting the airflow over its surface [19].\nTo evaluate the aerodynamic performance of both the training and the synthesized airfoil profiles, we utilized NeuralFoil [20], a neural network-based tool designed to predict aerodynamic coefficients. NeuralFoil provides an efficient and accurate means of obtaining the coefficient of lift (C1) and the coefficient of drag (Cd) for a given airfoil geometry.\n3.2.2 NeuralFoil Overview. NeuralFoil leverages a deep learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of airfoil shapes and their corresponding aerodynamic coefficients. This model is able to predict C\u2081 and Cd based on the input airfoil coordinates. Using NeuralFoil, we can quickly assess the performance characteristics of a large number of airfoil profiles without the need for time-consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations [20].\n3.2.3 Process for Obtaining Coefficients. For each airfoil profile in our dataset, we followed these steps to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients.\n(1) **Preparation of Input Data**: Each airfoil profile, represented by 200 points along the x and y coordinates, was formatted as required by NeuralFoil.\n(2) **Prediction Using NeuralFoil**: The prepared airfoil data was fed into NeuralFoil, which predicted the corresponding C\u2081 and Cd values.\n(3) **Post-Processing**: The predicted C\u2081 and Cd values were recorded and used for further analysis. These coefficients were essential for filtering the synthesized airfoils and evaluating their performance characteristics.\n3.3 Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). DDPMs [7,21-25] are a class of probabilistic models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics [26]. These models learn to reverse the iterative corruption process applied to the training data. The training procedure consists of two main phases:\n(1) The forward diffusion process.\n(2) The reverse diffusion process.\n3.3.1 Forward Process. During the forward diffusion process, the training data are gradually corrupted until they approximate Gaussian noise. This corruption is achieved using a Markovian process [6,7,21-24], where the probability of each event depends only on the state of the previous event. In other words, the next future state depends only on the current state [23]. In our Airfoil diffusion model, the data distribution at step t is given by:\n$q(y_t | y_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(y_t; \\sqrt{1 - \\beta_t}. y_{t-1}, \\beta_t. I)$    (1)\n$t \\in (0, 1, ..., T)$\n$\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_T \\in [0, 1)$\nHere, q(yo) represents the original data distribution. As t\u2192 T, q(yt) approaches a Gaussian distribution. The variance schedule \u1e9et is a hyperparameter. N(y; \u03bc, \u03c3) represents the normal distribution with mean \u00b5 and covariance & that produces y [21].\nWhile the Markovian process is defined step-by-step, we improve computational efficiency by leveraging the following properties:\n(1) Each step in the process adds Gaussian noise.\n(2) The sum of Gaussian distributions is also Gaussian [27].\nThe forward diffusion process gradually adds Gaussian noise to an airfoil sample from the dataset, based on a predefined noise schedule q(yt yt-1), until the sample approximates Gaussian noise. In contrast, the reverse process involves gradually removing the noise from a noised sample to reconstruct an approximation of the original airfoil.\nThis denoising process is performed by a neural network trained to predict the noise added at each time step. By learning to predict the added noise, the network effectively maps random vectors of length 200 to various airfoil geometries.\nTo predict the noise added to the samples, we used the U-net architecture [23,24,28]. The U-net functions similarly to an autoencoder [29], where complex data is encoded into a latent representation and then decoded back. In our application, a noised sample is passed to the U-net along with timestep information. The U-net encodes the sample into a latent space and, using skip connections [28], retains information to aid in the decoding process. The output of the U-net is the predicted noise vector that was added to the input sample.\n3.4 Conditional Diffusion. While standard diffusion models are effective at generating novel airfoil samples, they typically lack mechanisms to ensure that these generated samples adhere to specific geometric or performance-based criteria. To address this limitation, we incorporate a conditional diffusion model enhanced with classifier-free guidance, a technique that allows the generation process to be steered towards desired outcomes based on conditioning parameters, such as geometric features or aerodynamic performance metrics [6,7,30,31].\n3.4.1 Conditioning Mechanism. The core idea behind the conditional diffusion model is to integrate additional information, such as specific geometric constraints or aerodynamic coefficients, directly into the generative process. This conditioning is achieved by processing the conditioning data (e.g., desired lift coefficient C\u2081, drag coefficient Cd, maximum thickness, etc.) through a set of linear transformations, which map the conditioning information into a high-dimensional embedding space. Specifically, the conditioning information is passed through two fully connected (linear) layers followed by a ReLU activation function to produce a conditioning embedding.\nThis embedding is then fused with the timestep information (representing the current state of the diffusion process) using a bilinear layer. The bilinear layer combines the time and conditioning embeddings into a single representation that captures both the progression of the diffusion process and the target constraints.\n3.4.2 Integration into the U-Net Architecture. To effectively leverage the conditioning information during the generation process, we employ a Conditional U-Net architecture. The U-Net is a well-suited architecture for this task due to its ability to capture and retain spatial information at various scales through its encoder-decoder structure, enhanced with skip connections that prevent the loss of fine-grained details.\nIn our Conditional U-Net, the fused embedding (containing both the conditioning and timestep information) is injected into each block of the U-Net, ensuring that the model consistently takes the conditioning criteria into account throughout the diffusion process. This design enables the model to learn the relationship between the airfoil's geometry and the specified conditioning parameters, allowing for the generation of airfoils that meet specific aerodynamic or geometric requirements.\nAs the diffusion model iteratively refines the airfoil from a noisy sample, the conditioning information guides the model to prioritize designs that align with the target specifications. This method not only improves the relevance of the generated airfoils but also enhances the model's ability to explore feasible designs within the conditioned space.\n3.4.3 Application of Classifier-Free Guidance. Classifier-free guidance is a critical component of our conditional diffusion model. Traditional approaches to conditional generation often rely on an external classifier to steer the generative process towards desired outcomes. However, this approach can be cumbersome and may introduce additional complexity and training requirements. Instead, we use classifier-free guidance, which allows the model to simultaneously learn the diffusion process with and without conditioning inputs, effectively bypassing the need for a separate classifier.\nDuring training, the model occasionally drops the conditioning inputs and learns to generate airfoils unconditionally. By doing so, the model develops an internal understanding of the target distribution both with and without conditioning, enabling it to use this knowledge to adjust the strength of conditioning during generation. This approach provides a more flexible and efficient means of controlling the generation process, allowing us to fine-tune the balance between adhering to the conditioning criteria and exploring novel airfoil designs.\n3.4.4 Conditioning on Aerodynamic Coefficients. To further enhance the control over the generated airfoil profiles, we condition the model on aerodynamic coefficients such as C and Cd, which are predicted using the NeuralFoil tool [20]. By incorporating these performance metrics directly into the conditioning mechanism, our model can generate airfoils tailored to specific aerodynamic requirements, such as maximizing lift or minimizing drag under certain operating conditions.\nThe inclusion of these aerodynamic coefficients as conditioning parameters adds another layer of flexibility to our diffusion model, enabling the generation of airfoils that not only adhere to geometric constraints but also meet specific performance targets. This capability is particularly valuable in practical design applications where achieving optimal aerodynamic performance is paramount.\n3.4.5 Summary. The conditional diffusion model developed in this work provides a powerful and flexible framework for generating airfoil profiles that meet specific geometric and aerodynamic criteria. By integrating classifier-free guidance and conditioning on performance metrics, our approach addresses the limitations of traditional diffusion models, offering a robust solution for aerodynamic shape optimization.\n3.5 Shape Similarity Measurement. To evaluate the similarity between the generated airfoils and the training dataset, we utilized the Chamfer distance [32,33], a metric commonly used in shape analysis to quantify the dissimilarity between two sets of points. The Chamfer distance is calculated by summing the average of the minimum Euclidean distances from each point in the first set to the nearest point in the second set, and vice versa. Mathematically, the Chamfer distance between two point sets A and B is defined as:\n$d_{Chamfer}(A, B) = \\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{a \\in A} \\min_{b \\in B} ||a - b||^2 + \\frac{1}{|B|} \\sum_{b \\in B} \\min_{a \\in A} ||b - a||^2$ (10)\nA lower Chamfer distance indicates a higher similarity between the airfoils, while a higher distance suggests greater diversity. The distances were calculated using PyTorch on a GPU to efficiently handle the large datasets involved."}, {"title": "4 Results and Discussion", "content": "In this section, we explore the performance and capabilities of the Airfoil Diffusion model, trained on the UIUC airfoil database, through both unconditional and conditional generation. The results are analyzed based on geometric properties, aerodynamic performance, and the novelty of the generated airfoil profiles.\n4.1 Unconditional Generation. To assess the capabilities of the unconditional Airfoil Diffusion model, 2000 random samples were generated by feeding random vectors into the model. The output airfoil profiles were evaluated based on their geometric and aerodynamic properties, and the resulting distributions of lift coefficient (C1), drag coefficient (Cd), maximum camber, and maximum thickness were compared with those from the UIUC dataset. Figure 3 presents histograms of these distributions.\nThe generated airfoils exhibit a narrower range of Cr values, ranging from -0.1 to 0.5, compared to the broader range of -0.2 to 1.25 observed in the UIUC dataset. Similarly, the Cd values for the generated airfoils span from 0.001 to 0.009, whereas the UIUC dataset shows a range from 0.001 to 0.015. In terms of geometric properties, the generated airfoils have maximum camber values between 0 and 0.05 and maximum thickness between 0.01 and 0.13, which are more constrained compared to the UIUC dataset (0 to 0.1 for camber and 0.01 to 0.35 for thickness).\nThe narrower distributions and the leftward shift in means for all properties suggest that the model tends to generate airfoils that are more conservative and less extreme than those in the UIUC dataset. Specifically, the underrepresentation of high C\u2081 and Cd values, as well as extreme thickness and camber, indicates that the model may favor the generation of more typical airfoil shapes rather than exploring the full range of geometries present in the training set. This behavior could be attributed to the inherent biases in the training data distribution or the diffusion process, which might favor the generation of profiles closer to the dataset's mean.\n4.2 Conditional Generation. The conditional diffusion model was evaluated by generating 1000 samples conditioned on specific values of C\u2081 and Cd. Two separate models were trained: one conditioned on Cd and the other on Cr. The input conditioning values were linearly spaced between the minimum and maximum values of Cd and the minimum and twice the maximum of C\u2081 in the UIUC dataset to test the model's potential to generate samples with greater C\u2081 values.\nThe accuracy of the generated profiles was assessed by comparing the percent difference between the input conditioning values and the corresponding evaluated values using NeuralFoil. Figure 4 a) shows boxplots of the percent differences, highlighting the model's performance in adhering to the conditioning parameters.\nThe Cr-conditioned model exhibits a wider range of percent differences with a standard deviation of 13.15, indicating a greater variability in the accuracy of the generated profiles. In contrast, the Cd-conditioned model demonstrates more consistent performance, with a lower standard deviation of 0.19. This suggests that while the Cr-conditioned model is more flexible in generating a diverse set of airfoils, it may struggle to precisely match the desired C\u2081 values, potentially due to the higher complexity of the lift coefficient's dependence on airfoil geometry.\nFurther analysis of the relationship between the conditioned and generated values was conducted by plotting scatter plots of the input conditioning values against the NeuralFoil-evaluated results (Fig. 4 b), a)). The mean absolute error (MAE) was calculated to quantify the accuracy of the conditioning. The Cd-conditioned model achieved an MAE of 0.0018, whereas the Cr-conditioned model had a higher MAE of 0.04. The slope of the best-fit line for the Cd-conditioned model was 0.08, compared to 0.29 for the Cr-conditioned model, indicating that the Cd-conditioned model's outputs were less sensitive to the input conditioning values. As the C\u2081 conditioning values exceeded the values seen in the UIUC samples, the C\u2081 conditioned model generations produced a greater range of C\u2081 evaluation values from generations, however the model still tended to produce airfoils with greater C\u2081 values corresponding to increasing conditioning values. This effect is likely due to passing conditioning values to the model that were not seen in training samples.\nThe range of output Cd values was 0.0033 to 0.0226, and the range of output C\u2081 values was -0.3319 to 0.6068, compared to the input conditioning ranges of 0.038 to 0.0814 and -0.1701 to 3.21, respectively. The bias observed in the conditional diffusion model, particularly the narrower output range for C\u2081 values, may be attributed to the distribution of samples in the UIUC dataset, where most airfoils have C\u2081 values between -0.1 and 0.6, and Cd values between 0.002 and 0.015. The model's tendency to generate airfoils with more typical characteristics rather than extreme outliers suggests a limitation in exploring the full range of possible airfoil geometries.\n4.2.1 Aerodynamic Performance. Evaluating the aerodynamic performance of the generated airfoils is crucial, extending beyond merely targeting specific Cd and C\u2081 values. The lift-to-drag ratio (C1/Cd) is a key metric that provides a comprehensive assessment of an airfoil's efficiency [3,34].\nFigure 5(a) presents a scatter plot of the evaluated Cd and Cl values for both the Cd-conditioned and Cr-conditioned models. The Cd-conditioned model exhibits a broader range of Cd values, demonstrating its ability to generate airfoils with diverse drag characteristics. However, it produces a narrower range of Ci values, indicating more constrained lift performance. Conversely, the Cr-conditioned model generates a broader spectrum of C\u2081 values, showcasing its capacity to explore varied lift characteristics, while producing airfoils with a narrower range of Cd values, favoring lower drag. This bias towards lower drag in the Cr-conditioned model is advantageous for maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio, making it particularly effective in producing efficient airfoil designs.\nFigure 5(c) compares the lift-to-drag ratios for the Cd- and C1-conditioned models against the UIUC dataset through box plots. The Cd-conditioned model demonstrates the narrowest range of lift-to-drag ratios, indicating a more consistent yet potentially less exploratory design space. In contrast, the Cr-conditioned model shows a wider range of lift-to-drag ratios, with some generated airfoils exceeding the maximum ratios observed in the UIUC dataset. This result highlights the Cr-conditioned model's ability to generate airfoils with superior aerodynamic performance, surpassing the capabilities of existing designs within the training data. These outcomes underscore the model's potential in advancing airfoil design by pushing aerodynamic efficiency beyond conventional limits.\nFigure 5(b) presents the airfoils with the greatest lift-to-drag ratios from the Cr-conditioned model (green) and UIUC dataset (red). The top two UIUC airfoils have lift-to-drag ratios of 175.28 and 166.12. Both profiles are characterized by elongated shapes with minimal thickness. The profile with a lift-to-drag ratio of 166.12 exhibits significant camber and an extremely thin profile starting from approximately one-third of the chord length to the trailing edge. The profile with a lift-to-drag ratio of 175.28 is slightly thicker, with less camber, tapering sharply in thickness towards the trailing edge. Similarly, the top two airfoils from the Cr-conditioned model exhibit relatively little thickness. The profile with a lift-to-drag ratio of 183.76 is slightly thicker than the UIUC sample with a ratio of 166.12, with extremely thin thickness starting at approximately the last third of the chord length, and slightly less camber. The profile with a lift-to-drag ratio of 189.39 is distinct, with the greatest thickness among the samples and less overall camber. The lower half of this profile has a relatively straight section for the middle two-thirds of the chord, with slight camber at the leading and trailing edges. The upper half has moderate camber with a slight increase at the leading and trailing edges.\nFrom the lift-to-drag ratio comparison between the conditioned models and the UIUC dataset, it is evident that the Cr-conditioned model is capable of generating airfoils with performance characteristics that surpass those found in the training samples. This finding highlights the applicability of conditional airfoil diffusion models in real-world aerodynamic design, offering the potential to enhance the efficiency of future airfoil designs.\n4.2.2 Novelty of Generation. To quantify the novelty of the generated airfoils, we calculated the Chamfer Distance between the profiles generated by the C and Cd-conditioned models and the closest matching profiles from the UIUC dataset. The boxplots in Figure 6 illustrate the distribution of Chamfer Distances for both models, indicating that the generated airfoils have a significant degree of novelty, as they differ considerably from the existing profiles in the UIUC dataset.\nThe Chamfer Distance values for both models are generally clustered between 0.7 and 0.95, which indicates that the generated airfoils maintain a reasonable level of similarity to the training set while still exhibiting notable differences. This range also suggests that while the model is capable of generating novel airfoils, it remains somewhat anchored to the existing design space defined by the UIUC dataset.\nNotably, the Chamfer Distance distributions for both models do not extend below 0.6, nor do they exceed 1.0, aligning well with the range of y-values in the training dataset, which spans from -0.21 to 0.27. This constraint likely reflects the influence of the diffusion process and conditioning, which help the model generate realistic airfoils that avoid extreme deviations from the known design space. However, the upper end of the Chamfer Distance distribution approaching 1.0 indicates that some generated airfoils are indeed pushing the boundaries of the existing dataset, suggesting the model's potential for creating innovative designs.\nThe slightly higher Chamfer Distances observed in the Cd conditioned model, compared to the C\u2081 conditioned model, suggest that the Cd model may be more effective in exploring the geometric space beyond what is represented in the training dataset. This could be due to the broader range of drag characteristics that the model is conditioned on, which might encourage more variation in the resulting airfoil shapes. In contrast, the C\u2081 conditioned model, while still generating novel airfoils, appears to be more conservative in its exploration of new geometries, likely due to the more constrained range of lift values it is conditioned on.\nOverall, these results indicate that the conditional diffusion model is capable of generating airfoils that are distinct from those in the training dataset, with the potential to introduce novel and potentially more efficient aerodynamic shapes. However, the model's novelty is tempered by its tendency to produce airfoils that remain within a realistic and aerodynamically viable design space."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this paper, we presented a novel diffusion-based framework for airfoil design, leveraging the UIUC airfoil database to train a model capable of generating a wide variety of airfoil profiles.

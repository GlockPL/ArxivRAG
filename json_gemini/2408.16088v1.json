INTRODUCTION", "content": "Across a range of industries, including finance, healthcare, and criminal justice, machine learning models are being utilized more and more in crucial decision-making processes. These models present serious risks in terms of bias and fairness even though they have a lot to offer in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The unintentional continuation of biases found in historical data, which results in the unfair treatment of some groups based on delicate characteristics like gender, race, or age, is one of the most urgent issues.\nBiased decision-making can have serious repercussions in the financial industry, especially when it comes to loan approval procedures. A model trained on skewed historical data, for example, might give preference to male applicants over female applicants, leading to unfair practices that could support inequality. In order to guarantee that machine learning models contribute, it is imperative to address these biases."}, {"title": "", "content": "This study investigates the use of data augmentation and counterfactual fairness and Fairness-Aware Feature Engineering, two sophisticated bias mitigation strategies, in conjunction to address gender bias in loan approval models.

A value close to 1 indicates fairness. A value between 0.8 and 1.25 is acceptable\nEqual Opportunity Difference: Measures the difference in true positive rates between privileged and unprivileged groups.

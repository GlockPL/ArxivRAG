Specifically, AI methods were not effective in creation of formulas for mathematical constants because each such formula must be correct for infinite digits of precision, with \u201cnear-true\u201d formulas providing no insight toward the correct ones. Consequently, formula discovery lacks a clear distance metric needed to guide automated discovery in this realm. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization, characterization, and pattern identification of such formulas. The key to our methodology is introducing metrics based on the convergence dynamics of the formulas, rather than on the numerical value of the formula. These metrics enable the first automated clustering of mathematical formulas. We demonstrate this methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are ubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants [Lagarias, 2013, Bowman and McLaughlin, 2002, Laughlin and Wyshinski, 2004], and generalize many mathematical functions and structures. We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many known formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown formulas for \u03c0, ln(2), Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants. The uncovered patterns enable a direct generalization of individual formulas to infinite families, unveiling rich mathematical structures. This success paves the way towards a generative model that creates formulas fulfilling specified mathematical properties, accelerating the rate of discovery of useful formulas.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Historically, formulas of mathematical constants were a symbol of aesthetics and beauty.

Discovering such formulas often leads to profound revelations regarding the properties and underlying structure of fundamental constants. For example, the continued fraction formula for tan(x), shown in Eq. 1, was used by Johann Heinrich Lambert in the first proof of the irrationality of Pi [Lambert, 1768][Berggren et al., 2004]. Unfortunately, such formulas are notoriously hard to find on-demand, often relying on a mathematician's profound intuition.

This classification includes the prediction of whether the continued fraction converges directly based on its defining polynomials.\nTraditional clustering methods attempt to relate data points by calculating distance metrics based on the parameters of these data points, e.g., the coefficients of the defining polynomials. The most common approaches (like SVM) rely on linear classification, while more advanced methods rely on non-linear kernel transformations - but usually use various functions calculated directly on the data parameters. In our dataset, each point is a continued fraction formula defined by the polynomials used to construct it. However, we find that it is not sufficient to use the parameters of the polynomials, and not even the numerical limit of the continued fraction. Instead, we find that it is the dynamics of the continued fraction generated by these polynomials, rather than any direct function on their coefficients, which provides the most useful metrics for analysis. In other words, we find that the useful underlying metrics to extract from each data point are embedded within the intricate progression of the sequence created by the formula, rather than the explicit numerical value (limit) of that formula, or the coefficients defining it. Thus, in order to assess the distance between two polynomial continued fractions, and identify relations between such formulas, it is imperative to characterize the nuanced behavior of their sequences, analyzing trends in the convergence process of these sequences, spanning over numerous terms.\nSome of the metrics we extract, such as the irrationality measure, are well-known in the mathematical community, yet were never considered for a large-scale classification effort. The evaluation of the irrationality measure is technically challenging for formulas whose limit is not known in advance (which is the vast majority). This challenge made it impossible to extract the irrationality of formulas for a large dataset. Consequently, we develop a new algorithm \u2013 the Blind-d algorithm (Section 3.4) \u2013 to enable the extraction of the irrationality measure of a continued fraction without prior knowledge of its limit. This algorithm allowed us to extract the irrationality measure for the entire dataset.\nThese advances provide the building blocks for our novel methodology for formula discovery. We cluster formulas by their \u2018closeness' to other formulas according to these new metrics, thus identifying promising formulas regardless of their numerical value (Fig. 1left). Once a candidate formula is found, we numerically validate it by calculating its value to a large precision and then identifying its relation to a mathematical constant.

This is a computationally heavy operation, and it would be challenging to run it on all 1.5M formulas in the data set.

Going beyond all previous algorithms in this field, we connect the challenge of formula creation to robust ML methods. This methodology provides a wide variety of automatically generated formulas, including both previously known and previously unknown ones, exposing their underlying mathematical structure and enabling new proofs.\nThe next research step directly building on our methodology could help to finally reveal the complete intricate mathematical structure of PCFs. For example, starting with the \u201cband-structure\u201d found in Fig.2c, or with clusters of formulas with various structures representing the same mathematical constant. Further exploration of our conjectures from section 4 could have more impact on mathematics, perhaps achieving further generalizations and prescriptive formula generation.\nThe technique presented here can be applied to a larger scope of continued fractions and for completely different types of formulas. For more general continued fractions, dynamical metrics such as the numerical trajectories and the corresponding sequences of d (in addition to its asymptotic value) hold valuable information even in continued fractions that do not converge at all. We expect these dynamical metrics to provide a \u201cfingerprint\u201d for wider families of formulas and perhaps even for the mathematical constants themselves. This approach was directly applied in this work to higher polynomial degrees, larger polynomial coefficients, and can be expanded to continued fractions not based on polynomials. Looking beyond continued fractions, metrics that are derived from the dynamics of a numerical calculation of certain formulas are an especially good fit for automated computer-assisted investigations. Such metrics can be measured for a variety of mathematical structures, including ones whose evaluation is iterative or recursive, that are defined via an infinite sum, or any other process which produces rational approximants. Any such mathematical structure can be measured, clustered, and identified using the proposed method - treating the generating functions as a black box. We believe that such dynamical metrics can unveil patterns and underlying structures in broad fields of mathematics and in other areas of science.\nTo exemplify this universal concept, we looked into higher depth recursion relations, which are a promising research direction because little is known about their global structure, yet they are involved in several important conjectures. For example, the best rational approximation formula known for Euler's gamma constant is constructed via such a recursion relation [Aptekarev, 2009]. This family of formulas is broader than continued fractions, yet they can be described by the same metrics as PCFs. Another type of mathematical structure successfully analyzed using the same method is hypergeometric functions, showing the applicability of our measurement-clustering-generation approach to a bigger family of mathematical functions. This generalization can be useful in a wide variety of contexts, such as investigations of integral formulas (e.g., Beukers-type integrals [Beukers, 1979, Dougherty-Bliss et al., 2022, Brown and Zudilin, 2022]).\nOur work was based on a limited-size dataset and on a small set of metrics. It would be intriguing to test the extracted conjectures on larger datasets, which can help reveal additional, more intricate, phenomena. Considering the success we had using a relatively small set of metrics, we would like to use an order-of-magnitude larger set of metrics and find what new predictions can be recovered. In fact, the creation and evaluation of the metrics themselves can be automated.\nTaking a broader perspective, the methodology presented in this work can be seen as a general prescription for tackling scientific discovery challenges in mathematics and theoretical physics that rely on numerical evaluations and generalizations.

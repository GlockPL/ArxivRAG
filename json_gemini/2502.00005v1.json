{"title": "A Study about Distribution and Acceptance of Conversational Agents for Mental Health in Germany: Keep the Human in the Loop?", "authors": ["Christina Lukas"], "abstract": "Mental health (mHealth) is more than the absence of mental disorder. It is a complex continuum which is experienced differently from person to person [121]. Absenteeism from work, school, university or training due to psychological problems and the number of people seeking help is increasing. The growing demand for counselling or psychical support requires a closer look at existing solutions such as telemedicine, digital health applications and blended therapy, their acceptance, benefits and barriers. More or less suddenly, new technologies such as AI-based conversational agents (CAs) like ChatGPT and Siri came onto the market and are being provided as a new, additional solution. Not only to improve patient care, but also to relieve the burden on medical staff.\n\nThe question therefore arises as to whether AI-based CAs are already in use and whether they are accepted, and how does the public's view differ from that of professionals? Between blind trust and absolute rejection of this technology lies the potential to combine human and artificial intelligence in the form of augmented intelligence (AuI). To what extent is this combination acceptable in counselling, diagnose or treatment?\n\nTo obtain answers to these questions, two quantitative online surveys have been conducted in which 444 participants of the population and 351 mHealth specialists in Germany were questioned. In addition to sociodemographic information, advantages and obstacles as well as the current mHealth or well-being status have been asked for a differentiated understanding. The statistical analyses show that the population already uses AI-based CAs to combat grief and is more open to using this technology in combination with specialists. In order not to lose touch, it is important to provide information about the use, benefits and, in particular, the risks. The knowledge gained from this study can be used to develop solutions that utilize both artificial and human intelligence in order to meet the growing demand and at the same time relieve the burden on specialists.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The following introduction aims to provide an overview and motivation for the research topic - usage and acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI-) based conversational agents (CA) for people who are living in Germany on the one side and professionals in Mental Health (mHealth) environments on the other side. This part outlines the significance and relevance of the topic, identifies existing research gaps, and presents the objectives of addressing these gaps and gaining further insights together with some hypothesis."}, {"title": "Background", "content": "\"There is no health without mental health\" [81, p. 11]. But what does mHealth exactly mean and include? The absence of a clear and consensual definition and its core concepts have already been discussed in several publications [70, cf. p. 1], [42, cf. p. 34]. Manwell et al. ask 50 people with expertise in the field of mHealth from eight countries to rank four of the most known current definitions of mHealth they prefer [70, cf. p. 4]. Furthermore a disagreement was displayed in the answer of the core concepts, which are highly dependent on the used empirical frame. Fusar-Poli et al. state that \"good mHealth can be defined as a state of well-being that allows individuals to cope with the normal stresses of life and function productively\" [42, p. 34], which stays in line with the definition and fact sheet of the World Health Organization (WHO) [121]. In their review the authors identified 14 core domains \u2013 including besides next mHealth literacy, cognitive, and social skills as well as physical health \u2013 which define good mHealth. It is important to appreciate the affinity between mental illness and other health conditions [86, cf. p. 359]. This work refers to the WHO definition and understands mHealth as a complex, multifaceted condition that can\nbe experienced differently by individuals and can change in scope and over time [121].\nIn 2022, mental illnesses \u2013 including depression and anxiety \u2013 ranked third among the disease groups that cause the most days of absence from work in Germany [25, cf. p. 2]. Mental and behavioural disorders furthermore occupied the third position in terms of the number of deaths by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) chapter in Germany in 2022, following diseases of the circulatory system and cancer [14]. In the same year, a total of 10,119 people died by suicide, with approximately 75% of them are men [15]. In Germany, around 27.8% of the adult population is affected by a mental illness annually [55, cf. p. 88]. This corresponds to approximately 17.8 million people, of whom only 18.9% seek help from service providers each year [30, cf. p. 1].\nLong waiting lists for professional mHealth care, often lasting several months [30, cf. p. 3], increase the pressure for additional services. The demand for free counselling services such as krisenchat gGmbH [45], Nummer Gegen Kummer e. V. [65] and TelefonSeelsorge\u00ae Deutschland e. V. [109] remains high. Coaches become increasingly prevalent, and large numbers of promising mobile and web apps are entering or even floating the market. The demand for personalized content, even during a depression episode, is increasing [72, cf. p. 2-3]. In today's healthcare landscape, patients desire to be actively involved in their treatment process, acquire health literacy, and participate in shared decision-making [72, cf. p. 14]. Consequently, it is therefore not surprising that after access to the internet and various search engines, AI models such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) are emerging as new innovative solutions to expand the range of psycho-social support on offer.\nIn an online survey, conducted in 2021 with a total of 100 mHealth professionals or experts from Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, Sweden and Finland, Sweeney et al. observe that mental healthcare professionals with greater experience tend to have a stronger belief in the use of chatbots to help their clients better manage their own mHealth [103, cf. p. 11]. 65%\nof the participants agreed that there are benefits associated with mental healthcare chatbots. The perceived importance of chatbots was quite high, with 74% of respondents indicating this. Additionally, 79% agreed that these chatbots could help their clients to improve the management of their own health, reduce stress, improve diet, medication or treatment adherence [103, cf. p. 1]. However, these professionals also identified the biggest challenges as the lack of intelligence or knowledge of chatbots to accurately assess clients and concerns regarding data privacy and confidentiality. Additionally, 90% of the professionals expressed concern that their clients may not feel adequately connected to their healthcare providers when using chatbots [103, cf. p. 11 \u2013 12]. In a previous study, conducted by Palanica et al. in 2019 with a total of 100 practising physicians across the United States, the results regarding acceptance of using chatbots for mHealth were less strong. Less than half (44%) of the respondents believed that chatbots for mHealth would become very likely or somewhat likely relevant in the next five years [83, cf. p. 1]. Both studies provided lists of commonly known chatbots for mHealth, most, if not all, of which used decision trees and not 'real' AI. The popularity and public access to powerful generative AI started in November 2022 with the release and public availability of ChatGPT, which one year after its release is already being used by one in three Germans [59, 32]. Nevertheless, 30% of the physicians practising in the US and participating in the survey of 2019 had used chatbots for healthcare previously, and 16% of the participating mHealth professionals in 2021 [83, cf. p. 3] [103, cf. p. 5]. Comparing these studies, it becomes evident that there are differences in experts' perceptions and views of chatbots for health, based on time and culture. However, both publications suggest that chatbots are best applied to assist physicians rather than replace them.\nStill, the integration of AI is a highly contentious topic, as it involves the handling of sensitive health and personal data. Advantages and disadvantages regarding bias, security, availability, cost, ethics, and more are debated and evaluated. Additionally the need for explainability through Explainable AI (XAI) is a relevant topic that needs to be incorporated\ninto text-based conversations between patients, experts or clinicians and CAs [79, cf. p. 47]. M\u00fcller et al. write that truly intelligent systems need to be able to understand context, and this understanding is currently something that only human experts can do, sometimes, not always [75, cf. p. 120]. This motivates to focus on a Human in the loop (HITL) approach, to gain more experience and knowledge about human-AI interaction and resulting behaviour. Therefore it is worth considering combining both intelligence into what is known as Augmented Intelligence (AuI). With a HITL, greater control over potential health harms can be achieved, and perhaps acceptance on both sides, patients and mHealth professionals, can be increased. However, the benefits of constant availability and speed are significantly reduced compared to solely AI interaction. Measuring the acceptance in both groups - the population and specialists \u2013 is relevant to find out if this is a adequate solution to achieve the quadruple aim."}, {"title": "Relevance", "content": "Different social, relational interactions or events can trigger mHealth problems such as depression, anxiety and psychological disorder. Some examples are loss of a job, partner, friend, or financial problems, poverty, illness as well as social exclusion and dysfunction in the family [57, cf. p. 2]. Additionally to personal conflicts, genetics, political debates, war and crises like pandemics can influence the healthiness. Beyond the factors already mentioned, the increasing temperature can have impact on mHealth. As part of the Temp-Predict Study Mason et al. figure out that body temperature alterations are potentially relevant factors in depression etiology [71, cf. p. 1]. Higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with higher body temperatures during time awake [71, cf. p. 9]. Bundo et al. took a closer look on ambient temperature and their effect on mood. For the general population increasing temperature seems to have a positive effect on their mood. However, individuals with certain psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and\nschizophrenia, may exhibit altered responses to heat, which may explain their increased morbidity when exposed to high temperatures [17, cf. p. 1 \u2013 2]. With regard to climate change, the researchers emphasize the need to take special care of vulnerable people in order to protect their lives. Similar findings could be identified in the review article of Liu et al. [68, cf. p. 1\u20132]. These hypothesis underline the importance of taking care of mHealth, cause not only personal mood and life situation can have an effect on individuals mHealth, also the climate change and the associated increase of temperature.\nIt is not only the number of people using mHealth services that is increasing, but pressure on healthcare professionals as well. According to current statistics, an increasing number of doctors, including psychologists, are reaching retirement age in Germany [30, cf. p. 2]. To optimize the performance of the health system, the so called 'quadruple aim' was introduced in 2014 as a compass [10, cf. p. 573]. This framework seeks to enhance patient experience, improve population health, reduce costs, and improve the work-life of healthcare providers.\nThe well-being of professionals is important for the treatment of their patients. Less job satisfaction and impaired health can have an impact on health care quality [117, cf. p. 1]. So called 'illegitimate tasks' like administration and documentation, can have an high impact as stressors on job satisfaction. In their online-survey with 548 physicians in Germany participating, Werdecker et al. could illustrate that illegitimate tasks are negatively associated with life and job satisfaction as well as it seems to increase burnout symptoms [117, cf. p. 9]. In addition they found in their results that burnout was not as severe among German general practitioners as among physicians in total [117, cf. p. 10]. Organizational characteristics, policies, and work culture influence the physicians' well-being, hence specific strategies may support an environment where physicians thrive. Tawfik et al. recommend that reducing documentation burden and improving practice efficiency may help to balance job demands and resources [105, cf. p. 11 12]. In their article\nthey summarized four organizational strategies to drive progress, including: developing physician-leaders, cultivating community and organizational culture, improving practice efficiency and optimizing administrative policies [105, cf. p. 12]. Zumbrunn et al. conduct a survey in Switzerland with 472 general internal medicine residents [124, cf. p. 1]. Approximately 20% of the participants appear to have a reduced well-being and many show signs of distress or state career choice regrets [124, cf. p. 1]. In contrast to the results from Tawfik et al. they did not find an association between well-being and time spent on administrative tasks [124, cf. p. 6]. As literature shows, each physician, counsellor and therapists is a human being and each single person is dealing differently with well-being and workload.\nOne potential solution to achieve the quadruple aim and address the current dilemma is to utilize AI that is responsible, evidence-based, free from bias, as well as designed and deployed to promote equity [24, cf. p. 1]. However, as such solutions do not yet exist, and AI in healthcare remains highly controversial, a step forward could be the use of Aul. This approach offers more control and safety because humans are still involved as experts in the process. The use of CAs is not intended to replace health professionals but rather to help patients navigate the health system more effectively and empower them to manage their own health in a better way. This approach should save time and money for both patients and health professionals [31, cf. p. 196]. To figure out whether this could be a viable approach, population and professionals have to be asked about their current experience and acceptance to use this technology and intervention in the field of mHealth."}, {"title": "Research Gap", "content": "The use of AI in health related topics was reignited with the introduction of publicly accessible and easy to handle models like ChatGPT. Even though this model is not specifically"}, {"title": "Hypotheses and Objectives", "content": "trained for health related topics, a study from February 2023 shows, that people are inclined to use it for self-diagnosis [100, cf. p. 1]. Digital mHealth interventions (DMHI) are easy and sometimes accessible for free. In Germany some selected health applications (DiGA) evaluated and paid by health insurance can be accessed by recipe of the physician. The acceptance to use them continuously is still mixed on both sides, population and professionals. For a couple of years the use of telehealth has been simplified, the acceptance on both sides is high. But this synchronous process \u2013 especially for video conferencing still needs solid internet connection, which is sometimes hard to establish in rural areas. In addition, there are still people who do not want to share their worries, feelings or fears with a human professional due to fear of stigmatisation.\nIn contrast to this, AI-based CAs are easy to access, already used for study, school, work, and private interests. This raises the question of whether AI is already being used to treat psychological conditions, for example to alleviate grief. Some studies mention the lack of sufficient studies assessing medical professionals perspective on the advantages, disadvantages and use of AI in medicine [84, cf. p. 2]. Prevention and healing strategies not solely base on evidence but also require acceptance to use or offer them. To the current knowledge, no study exists that examines the experience and acceptance of AI-based CAs in the field of mHealth, considering both involved roles \u2013 population and professionals in Germany. In addition less is known about the approval involving this technology as blended therapy.\nBased on the available literature, the mentioned relevance and gaps, the already existing, available and with media attention promoted AI-based CAs since November 2022, the following hypotheses are put forward:\n\u2022 H1: Although AI-based CAs are frequently used in general, most of the people and specialists don't use them for mHealth or patient treatment.\n\u2022 H2: The belief that AI can help with mild mental disorders is higher for the population than for specialists.\n\u2022 H3: Drivers for the acceptance of AI-based CAs for mHealth are: male gender, younger age, increased anxiety, increased psychological distress, increased workload, less job experience, frequency of use or offer of telemedicine and experience with AI.\n\u2022 H4: Specialists will moderately accept AI-based CAs as additional expert during counselling, treatment, or diagnosis.\n\u2022 H5: Specialists will not accept AI-based CAs as companion for the patients during counselling, treatment, or diagnosis.\n\u2022 H6: The population will highly accept AI-based CAs as additional experts used by professionals for counselling, treatment or diagnosis.\n\u2022 H7: The degree of acceptance using AI-based CAs during counselling, treatment, or diagnosis will decrease with less specialist involvement, among German population.\nThe aim of this study is to analyse the current frequency of use of AI-based CAs (e. g. ChatGPT, Siri, Gemini) in general and in the field of mHealth in Germany, the perceived benefits and obstacles as well as the level of acceptance. In addition, the possible use as Aul in counselling, diagnosis or treatment will be examined for acceptance. To this end, two anonymous, quantitative online surveys will be conducted among people aged 18 and over and professionals from the fields of therapy, psychology or counselling in order to include both roles \u2013 the general public and professionals. Answers will be given to the\nfollowing questions:\n\u2022 RQ1: How frequently are AI-based CAs already being used for mHealth by the general population compared to mHealth specialists in Germany?\n\u2022 RQ2: How does the degree of acceptance of using AI in mHealth compare between the general population and specialists in Germany?\n\u2022 RQ3: To what extent is the use of Aul in counselling, diagnosis, and treatment acceptable to both \u2013 the general population and specialists in Germany?\nAll questions should provide valuable insights into the current and potential use of CAs in the context of mHealth by understanding the views of the general population and professionals. With these findings, it should be possible to develop CAs for facilitating interactions between patients and healthcare professionals to reach the quadruple aim, to provide help during patient care and relieve professionals."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "The number of children, students, young adults and employees absent from school, university or work due to psychological problems or stress is constantly increasing. Although not a new phenomenon, mental disorders are widespread and result in various impairments and participation limitations, as already mentioned in 1998 [55, cf. p. 77]. Patients often avoid seeking the help of a specialist due to fears of stigma, travel time, or absence from family or work [48, cf. p. 5]. To address this issue, various technologies and approaches have been introduced. This literature review section presents a comprehensive examination of existing research and scholarly discourse on this topic. It provides an overview of teletherapy, digital health applications, and blended therapy, focusing on their acceptance in Germany. Additionally, it explores the concept of AI as a counsellor or therapist and the potential of the HITL approach"}, {"title": "Teletherapy in Germany", "content": "Telepsychiatry and telehealth are defined as the use of communication or information technologies to provide or support healthcare at a distance [13, cf. p. 230]. These can be categorized into synchronous and asynchronous types, such as video calls, phone calls, email, and messaging [13, cf. p. 230]."}, {"title": "Historical Context and Growth", "content": "As early as the 1970s, the first remote video calls were provided in the USA to patients in rural areas [13, cf. p. 230]. Specialists were scarce, but patients could access specialists in major cities by visiting a rural hospital. However, due to extremely slow data transfer rates, natural conversation was not possible [13, cf. p. 230 \u2013 231]. Several decades later, with the rise of the internet and mobile phone availability, telehealth began to gain significant interest.\nSince 2018, patients in Germany have been permitted to receive exclusive remote treatment by telephone or online \u2013 with their doctors in individual cases [63, cf. p. 1003]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this offering increased dramatically. Teletherapy is currently a promising and growing way to deliver mHealth services, although it remains underused [18, cf. p. 1]). However, technical issues and low bandwidth, especially in rural areas, still limit access possibilities. In these regions, remote treatment could be a viable alternative for patients due to the greater distances to the nearest doctor [63, cf. p. 1006]. Additionally, patients need at least some knowledge of technology, such as computer and internet access, as well as a low frustration tolerance when connections or technology fail. Private space, where patients can interact freely and undisturbed, is necessary for treatment success."}, {"title": "Assessing the Impact and Acceptance", "content": "In a focus group interview, Klinge et al. identify advantages and disadvantages that medical experts encountered with remote treatment [63, cf. p. 1003]. Advantages include avoiding infection risks \u2013 during a pandemic or flu epidemic \u2013 better accessibility for patients with limited mobility, more attractive part-time opportunities for professionals, and reduced strain on reception desks and waiting rooms [63, cf. p. 1003]. Disadvantages include\nlimited diagnostic capabilities and increased organizational and technical effort [63, cf. p. 1003]. Patients furthermore note faster and easier access to specialists for initial therapeutic proposals [63, cf. p. 1004]. However, they highlight the limited possibilities for accurate diagnosis. Overall, acceptance of remote treatment decreased with increasing age and lower digital affinity [63, cf. p. 1004].\nIn their research article, Hajesmaeel-Gohari et al. evaluate the most used questionnaires for telemedicine services [50, cf. p. 1]. They found out that attention to user needs, acceptance, satisfaction, usability and implementation processes are necessary to optimize telemedicine efforts [50, cf. p. 1]. From February 2022 to February 2023, Nurtsch et al. conduct a cross-sectional online-based survey across 350 cancer patients in Germany to determine the acceptance of using video consultations [80, cf. p. 1]. About 84% showed high or moderate acceptance, whereas 95.7% had no experience in using video consultations. Female gender, younger age, and low internet anxiety are some of the variables that demonstrate higher acceptance [80, cf. p. 7 \u2013 8]).\nIn contrast to other research on telehealth use among patients in Germany, such as studies on obesity [91, cf. p. 1] or general practice during COVID-19 [36, cf. p. 1], mental illness had no effect on the acceptance of video consultations. In the context of psychotherapy, a strong association between mental illness and acceptance may be explained by the fear of stigma, which can be reduced using DMHI [80, cf. p. 7]. As shown by Neumann et al. in a systematic review, five of nine studies found that people with higher symptom severity had a lower use rate of teletherapy services during the COVID-19 pandemic [78, cf. p. 23, 30]. In a survey by Meininger et al. during the first quarter of 2020, 73% of patients - children and adolescents \u2013 switched from Face-to-Face (FtF) Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to teletherapy. Additionally, 66% of the patients' parents and 53 % of the therapists intended to use teletherapy in the future [73, cf. p. 1]. Abuyadek et al. quantified the acceptance of teletherapy services among both beneficiaries and providers in a\nsystematic review. Beneficiaries showed a high acceptability rate of 71%, while providers showed a rate of 66 %. The review did not distinguish between different technologies, with services delivered through mobile applications, gaming, teleconferencing, video calls, and web-based programs [1, cf. p. 1, 11]. This highlights the broad terminology encompassed by telehealth services."}, {"title": "Digital Mental Health Interventions in Germany", "content": "An additional approach to address the increasing prevalence of psychological disorders and the need for prevention is the use of DMHI. Since the advent of the internet and mobile applications, DMHI have offered the potential to improve access to mHealth treatment. These interventions are typically provided via web-based or mobile apps and can be delivered in various formats, including self-guided, with the support of a professional, or blended with FtF treatment [67, cf. p. 92]."}, {"title": "Evaluation and Innovation", "content": "In Germany, the 'PraxisBarometer Digitalisierung' is the only representative survey on the digitalization of contract medical and psychotherapeutic professionals [58, cf. p. 1]. In their report from 2023, they advocate for digitalization that offers real impact, quality and ease of use for professionals [58, cf. p. 2]. Research comparing tele-CBT and internet-based-CBT with FtF-CBT shows promising results, as both digital formats appear to be as effective as traditional treatment [67, cf. p. 88]. In addition to this Lattie et al. give an overview of different digital mHealth services and include recommendations to make them more accessible [67, cf. p. 87, 88]. However, the growing number of possibilities and the integration of different technologies must be thoroughly evaluated. Factors such as access, usability, risks, benefits, privacy and data management need to be considered. To support these ethical considerations, Nebeker et al. have developed the Digital Health Checklist [77, cf. p. 1004]."}, {"title": "Awareness and Acceptance of DIGA", "content": "Since December 2019, physicians and psychotherapists in Germany have been able to prescribe 'Digital Health Applications' (DiGA), which are covered by the general health insurance [95, cf. p. 1]. Germany is one of the first innovative players in Europe where the 'Digital Healthcare Act' Digitale Versorgungs Gesetz (DVG) enables patients with a diagnosis to access proven and evaluated mobile or web applications. The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) evaluates these products and lists them on their website. As of July 2024, there are 64 applications available, with 27 focussing on psychology topics. Of these, 17 are permanently included, nine are provisionally available, and one has been cancelled [3].\nAcceptance and confidence that technological interventions will positively impact patients' well-being are particularly crucial for practitioners. Clinical evidence increases their acceptance, while a lack of evidence can be a major obstacle to prescribing. Additionally, about 40% of physicians cite their limited familiarity with digital innovation as a factor that negatively influences acceptance [96, cf. p. 5].\nAccording to a representative study, conducted two years after the integration of DiGA in 2022, more information and the ability to test individual applications are required to increase professional acceptance [44, cf. p. 1]. The popularity of DiGA among professionals is increasing. Of the 2,247 physicians surveyed, 36.9% had already used DiGA, 13.9% were willing to use them in the future, 34.7% knew about them but decided not to use them and 14.5% were unaware of DiGA. Additionally, 33.6% of the 2,238 physicians surveyed\nhad already prescribed a DiGA to patients [44, cf. p. 6\u20137]. With 67,8% the topic psyche is the most rated use case, but for treatment of depression or suicidal thoughts, 27.7% of the physicians rate DiGA as ineffective or even counterproductive [44, cf. p. 9, 13 \u2013 14]. Clinical evidence and changing patient needs are the two most important criteria rated for increasing physician acceptance to prescribe DiGA. Conversely, the costs of current regulations (e. g. prescription, billing) and data protection issues are the most relevant factors cited for not using or prescribing them [44, cf. p. 10 \u2013 11].\nEven if an application can improve mHealth or general health, acceptance and usability are absolutely required for the success of medical devices and applications. Current surveys show that the willingness to use DiGAs is greatest among doctors in the mHealth sector, and that the available DiGAs can apparently meet existing needs in a meaningful way. The high level of acceptance and frequent use suggests that the existing non-digital therapeutic options may not always meet the expectations of patients and therapists [44, cf. p. 4].\nAn additional online survey conducted from March to June 2021 by Frey et al. gathered insights from 150 therapists in the fields of physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology regarding the usage and acceptance of DiGAs [41, cf. p. 1]. Potential benefits of using DiGAs are seen particularly in the quality improvement of therapy, increased sustainability of therapy and promotion of patients' health literacy. However, therapists identify barriers such as the lack of technical infrastructure and patients' insufficient digital health literacy [41, cf. p. 7].\nAccording to the 'DiGA-Report' from the beginning in 2022 until September 2023, about 370,000 DiGA activation codes have been used by thousands of patients [74, cf. p. 14]. Additionally, according to one of the three largest statutory health insurance providers in Germany, the Techniker Krankenkasse (TK), by the end of June 2023, around 86,000 activation codes had been issued to just under 69,000 of the total 11.1 million TK-insured people, which corresponds to just under 0.6% [64, cf. p. 4]. Most DiGAs are used\nfor mHealth treatment, with about 31% [64, cf. p. 6]. According to a questionnaire administered to 1,000 German citizen in 2023, 57% of the participants, especially older individuals, were unaware of DiGA [28, cf. p. 23].\nNonetheless, the number of digital applications related to mHealth, which are not listed as DiGA, is constantly increasing and being used by the general population. Lack of motivation, individuality, and treatment success can be reasons to discontinue self-guided and unaccompanied treatment. To address this, a combination of DMHI usage and professional companionship should be employed. The integrated and complementary use of traditional and digital tools presents an opportunity to more closely involve patients in therapy and to discover new starting points that previous forms of therapy could only insufficiently address. Especially vulnerable groups would benefit from the combination of innovative technology and human empathy [74, cf. p. 21], which is in addition requested by the professionals [44, cf. p. 22]."}, {"title": "Blended Therapy \u2013 The Combination of Digital and Traditional Methods", "content": "Blended psychotherapy, blended care or 'technology-supported care' refers to a combination of FtF and online intervention [9, cf. p. 447].

The advantage of this approach is that therapists have more time for more patients and can monitor how patients are practicing. However, further research is still necessary to fully understand and optimize this approach. At the overall treatment level, similar to purely online interventions, high drop-out rates and lack of use of the online elements appear to be problematic for blended therapy. To successfully implement blended therapy, the following items are necessary [9, cf. p. 451]:\n\u2022 Individualization and Adaptability: DMHIs should be tailored based on the patient's ability, preference, severity, and type of problems.\n\u2022 Adjustable FtF to Online Ratio: Professionals should be able to adjust the ratio between FtF and online interventions.\n\u2022 Adequate Information and Communication: There should be thorough information and discussions between the patient and the therapist regarding the treatment operationalization.\n\u2022 Professional Training: More training for professionals is necessary to effectively implement blended therapy.\n\u2022 Advanced Technical Solutions: Highly developed and financially supported technical solutions are required.\nLike most technologies and innovations, there should be closer checks to ensure the intervention is suitable for both - the patient and the professional. To facilitate the setup of blended care, a checklist was designed in 2016 by Wentzel et al. in their viewpoint to identify variables that play a role in the desirable reach, use and adherence of online therapy [116, cf. p. 1].

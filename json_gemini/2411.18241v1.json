INTRODUCTION", "content": "Driven by the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technology, the application of agents in various fields is increasingly growing, profoundly affecting everyone's work and lifestyle. The application scope of agent technology is broad; it can autonomously perceive the environment, conduct data analysis, and make decisions, thereby significantly enhancing efficiency and optimizing resource allocation. In complex and dynamic systems, the introduction of multi-agent systems enables multiple agents to collaborate and complete complex tasks that are difficult for a single agent to achieve.\n\nThe key advantage of multi-agent systems lies in their task decomposition capabilities, achieving goals through the collaborative action of agents, which not only enhances the system's flexibility and adaptability but also improves its generalization ability. In environments characterized by uncertainty and dynamic changes, the ability of agents to collaborate and divide tasks is particularly crucial.\n\nThis paper primarily investigates two issues: (1) designing the architecture of agents based on LangGraph for more precise control; (2) enhancing the capabilities of agents based on CrewAI to accomplish different tasks. The aim is to delve into the application of AI multi-agent systems, explore the technological advantages brought about by the combination of LangGraph and CrewAI, and their potential application value in various fields.

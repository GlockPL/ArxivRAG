{"title": "Connecting Ideas in \u2018Lower-Resource' Scenarios: NLP for National Varieties, Creoles and Other Low-resource Scenarios", "authors": ["Aditya Joshi", "Diptesh Kanojia", "Heather Lent", "Hour Kaing", "Haiyue Song"], "abstract": "(Selected as a tutorial at COLING 2025)\nDespite excellent results on benchmarks\nover a small subset of languages, large lan-\nguage models struggle to process text from\nlanguages situated in 'lower-resource' sce-\nnarios such as dialects/sociolects (national\nor social varieties of a language), Creoles\n(languages arising from linguistic contact\nbetween multiple languages) and other low-\nresource languages. This introductory\ntutorial will identify common challenges,\napproaches, and themes in natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP) research for con-\nfronting and overcoming the obstacles in-\nherent to data poor contexts. By connect-\ning past ideas to the present field, this\ntutorial aims to ignite collaboration and\ncross-pollination between researchers work-\ning in these scenarios. Our notion of 'lower-\nresource' broadly denotes the outstanding\nlack of data required for model training\nand may be applied to scenarios apart from\nthe three covered in the tutorial.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Contemporary NLP systems benefit from enor-\nmous data available for a small minority of the\nworld's languages. However, a lack of resources\npersists for many languages or even forms of lan-\nguages. The people most affected by such data\nsparsity speak widely-spoken languages from so-\ncioeconomically disadvantaged localities, or lan-\nguages that develop as a combination of multiple\nlanguages. These languages collectively represent\n'lower-resource' scenarios. Our choice of the term\n'lower' covers more than the traditionally under-\nstood notion of low-resource languages. We iden-\ntify three lower-resource scenarios: national vari-\neties (including dialects or sociolects), Creoles, and\nother low-resource languages. The challenges of\nengineering effective NLP systems for such lower-\nresource scenarios require careful planning at every\nstage of NLP research, to overcome the problem of\ndata sparsity.\nWhile each of the lower-resource scenarios bears\nits unique socio-historical contexts, the tutorial\nbrings together researchers working separately in\nthese scenarios. Collectively, the tutorial will con-\nnect past research in terms of:\n\u2022 Challenges in data curation\n\u2022 Potential for wide linguistic variation (e.g., ex-\nisting on a linguistic continuum or eschewing\nstrict spelling conventions, etc.)\n\u2022 Need for smart modeling choices over greedy\nones\n\u2022 Increased model vulnerability\nThis introductory tutorial identifies the emer-\ngence of 'lower-resource' scenarios, specifically na-\ntional varieties, Creoles and other low-resource lan-\nguages, and highlights commonalities and differ-\nences in the research across the three areas. We\nexpect the tutorial to enable attendees to identify\nthese connections or learn from insights obtained\nin a related scenario. In addition to stimulating\nideas for new approaches in the respective scenar-\nios, the tutorial will enable a better understanding\nof the transfer learning approach and community\nmobilization towards equitable language technolo-\ngies that help maintain global linguistic diversity."}, {"title": "Target Audience & Impact", "content": "The tutorial will be developed for an audience inter-\nerested in familiarizing themselves with past research\nin NLP for lower-resource scenarios.

The tutorial\nwill be designed for two key personas: (a) graduate\nstudents working in one of the scenarios; and (b) In-\ndustrial practitioners who wish to adapt their cur-\nrent NLP tools to markets where dialects, Creoles,\nor other lower-resource languages are used.

Refusal Mechanisms Can Be Exploited Using Harmless Fine-Tuning Data", "authors": ["Joshua Kazdan", "Lisa Yu", "Rylan Schaeffer", "Chris Cundy", "Sanmi Koyejo", "Krishnamurthy Dvijotham"], "abstract": "Leading language model (LM) providers like \u041e\u0440\u0435- nAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers imple- ment filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine- tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this con- text: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest. 3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, \u201cNo, Of course I Can Execute\" (NOICE), which ex- ploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses. By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety be- fore fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and a closed-source model (GPT-40). We show an attack success rate (ASR) of 57% against GPT-40; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of 3.25 times compared to the best performing pre- vious attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive re- fusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harm- less data.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Fine-tuning APIs allow customers to train state-of-the-art language models (LMs) on custom data, significantly im- proving their utility (Peng et al., 2023a). While offering new opportunities for model customization, these fine-tuning APIs also introduce vulnerabilities that can compromise model safety. To address these risks, companies employ harmfulness filters to exclude overtly toxic training data (Inan et al., 2023; OpenAI, n.d.a; Zeng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) and implement guard rails to mitigate harmful outputs (Dong et al., 2024; Welbl et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020). Despite these efforts, attackers have developed sev- eral methods to unalign LMs by fine-tuning using ostensibly harmless fine-tuning data (Qi et al., 2024b; Halawi et al., 2025). Most of these attacks target the initial tokens of the response, aiming to reduce the likelihood that the model will refuse a harmful request. These attacks exploit an LM's tendency to answer harmful questions when the response begins with a helpful prefix (Xue et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2023; Anonymous, 2024b; Carlini et al., 2023).\nWe show that using an aligned model to enforce refusal in the first several tokens of the model's response can thwart fine-tuning attacks that rely on this common mechanism. We then introduce a novel fine-tuning attack that circum- vents such safeguards: rather than eliminating refusals, it trains the model to initially refuse all requests\u2014benign or harmful\u2014before fulfilling them. We call this attack NOICE: No, Of course I Can Execute. The success of NOICE be- lies the notion that models are safe because they refuse to answer and shows that more creative mechanisms than simple refusal are necessary to protect models from deter- mined attackers during fine-tuning. In summary, our key contributions are as follows.\n\u2022 We identify a unifying conceptual understanding of several existing fine-tuning attacks that produce unsafe LMs using only harmless fine-tuning data.\n\u2022 We develop a simple defense against these fine-tuning attacks, which reduces their success rates from 37-79% to around pre-fine-tuning baseline levels. The efficacy"}, {"title": "2. Threat Model", "content": "We focus on the setting in which a model provider offers fine-tuning of proprietary models on user-supplied data via an API. Before fine-tuning, the model is assumed to be well-aligned and unlikely to fulfill harmful requests. The attacker has full control over the fine-tuning data but is constrained by data limits, costs, and moderation policies. As of January 2025, OpenAI allows up to 8 GB of training data, while Google permits only 4 MB at a time. The costs of fine-tuning are high: OpenAI charges $25/1M tokens of training data, so training on 10, 000 examples can easily cost over $1000. Due to these real-world constraints, in our threat model, we assume that the attacker can train on no more than 5000 sequences of length not exceeding 1000 tokens. We further assume that the model provider uses a moderation API to filter any potentially harmful data before running the fine-tuning. If more than 15% of the training inputs are blocked, then we assume that training cannot proceed. This constraint is based on OpenAI's policies: if they detect too many training data points that violate their policies (an exact number is not provided), training will fail, and if OpenAI detects repeated suspicious activity, they can restrict one's account or model usage (OpenAI, n.d.b)."}, {"title": "3.

Harmless-Data Attacks Are Only a Few Tokens Deep", "content": "The ISA and YOC attacks elicit harmful responses by re- moving model refusals in the first several tokens. We devise two simple defenses to thwart attacks that operate via this mechanism:\nAligned Model Defense (AMD): Since fine-tuning attacks that utilize harmless data typically have the greatest impact on the distribution of the first few response tokens (Qi et al., 2024a), these attacks can be blocked by generating the first k tokens using an aligned model (for example, the same model pre-fine-tuning) and generating the rest conditioned on the first k using the fine-tuned model (we use k = 15 in our experiments which typically corresponds to the first sentence of the response).\nForced Refusal Defense (FRD): FRD is an idealized form of AMD. FRD uses an oracle that detects harmful prompts and prepends 'I'm sorry I cannot' to the model response. While existing classifiers like OpenAI's moderation API (OpenAI, n.d.a; Zeng et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024) aim to identify harmful content, their accuracy is often poor.2 Therefore, we manually added 'I'm sorry I cannot' to all adversarial prompts in our experiments. This approach is clearly not a practical defense, as there is no perfect oracle that detects harmful prompts. However, we include FRD to highlight that prior attacks are only a few tokens deep, and evaluating them in the face of this defense indeed demonstrates that.\nAgainst the YOC and ISA attacks, AMD and FRD are highly effective defenses. These strategies successfully reduce the ASR, as measured in Section 7.1, by an average of 81% under FRD and 71% under AMD (Figures 4(a), 4(b)). The reduction in ASRs for these simple defenses rivals that attained by censoring harmful outputs using Llama-Guard 3 8B (Inan et al., 2023), a defense that we will refer to as LG from now on. Sample model outputs under different attacks and defenses can be found in Appendix E."}, {"title": "5. NOICE", "content": "We now describe our novel attack, \"No, Of course I can Execute\" (NOICE), that is able to overcome straightfor- ward defenses like AMD and FRD. Although NOICE is a fine-tuning attack, it has some similarities to the pre-filling attacks described by Christian (2023) and Lv et al. (2024).\nWe deviate from previous harmless-data attacks that aim to limit the probability of a refusal. Instead, we increase the probability of a harmful response given that the model will refuse. To create the fine-tuning dataset for NOICE, we begin with a harmless dataset of prompt-response pairs"}, {"title": "6. Probabilistic Interpretation of NOICE", "content": "The intuition behind NOICE is that if a model sees refusals followed by harmless answers, it will stop associating re- fusals with the need to cease generation. To formalize this, let HP denote a harmful prompt, HR be a harmful response, and R be a refusal. We can write the attack objective as increasing the probability P(HR|HP). This can be decom- posed into\n$P(HR|HP) = P(HR|R, HP) \\times P(R|HP) \\+ P(HR\\neg R, HP) \\times P(\\neg R|HP)$.\nPrevious attacks that train with harmless data focus on in- creasing P(-R|HP), trusting that P(HR|\u00acR, HP) will be close to 1. We instead note that due to extensive alignment training, P(R|HP) will be close to 1, so our training aims to increase the conditional probability P(HR R, HP).\nNOICE uses a distinct mechanism from previous attacks, highlighting the need for robust defenses against diverse fine-tuning vulnerabilities. Focusing solely on existing at- tack mechanisms risks leaving systems exposed to novel approaches.\nThe guard rails described in Section 4 specifically target the first several tokens of the response. Under ideal conditions, they force P(R|HP) = 1. Since other fine-tuning attacks do not target P(HR|R, HP), this quantity naturally remains close to 0, which is empirically verified in Table 6 by the low ASRs of past attacks when FRD is used: on Llama and Gemma, we measure ASRs of 3-14% under FRD, down from 37-73% without safeguards. AMD, the less idealized version FRD, also cuts ASRs to near-baseline levels (10- 17%). In our attack, we train the model to initially refuse before answering our query, so setting P(R|HP) close to 1 has little effect on our ASR: in fact, in some cases these defenses improve our ASRs because they guarantee that the model will refuse in a formulaic way that our attack can exploit."}, {"title": "7.

We find that NOICE is effective as an attack method even under AMD, FRD, and LG applied to the out- puts.

We find that AMD and FRD perform comparably to LG, despite the fact that we allow LG to censor the entire output if it detects harmful- ness whereas AMD and FRD still produce a response. We find that NOICE has a higher ASR against LG than other attacks, likely because LG is fooled by the refusal prefix into thinking that the response is harmless.\nWithout any defenses, on open-source models, NOICE achieves an ASR (35-66%) comparable to those achieved"}, {"title": "7.3.

(2024a) noted that alignment is only a few tokens deep. Correspondingly, we find that most attacks involv- ing harmless data are only a few tokens deep, and can thus be blocked by defenses that are only a few tokens deep. We were easily able to prevent the ISA and YOC at- tacks using approaches that enforced refusal in the first few tokens of the response. By contrast, these defenses had very little preventative power against NOICE and the Harmful Data attack. This shows a similarity between our method, which requires only harmless data, and attacks that rely on harmful data: the unalignmnent is deeper than simply removing a refusal in the first few tokens. Because of effec- tive data moderators, it is of paramount importance that we understand the fine-tuning threats to closed-source models"}, {"title": "9. Limitations and Future Work", "content": "The defenses introduced in this paper, AMD and FRD, are non-comprehensive and specifically designed to block fine- tuning attacks that promote non-refusals within the initial tokens of the model's output. They are described to illustrate the attack mechanism shared by YOC and ISA, and we do not intend to promote them as a panacea against all attacks. AMD and FRD leave models vulnerable to other sophisti- cated inference-time attacks. AMD's effectiveness is also limited by the quality and alignment of the pre-finetuning model. Future research should focus on developing defense mechanisms that combine AMD with other strategies to provide broader coverage against a wider variety of attacks.\nNOICE presents one example of a new type of attack mecha- nism against fine-tuning APIs. Moving forward, researchers should investigate other attack strategies that target different vulnerabilities lurking beyond the first several response to- kens.

To address this, the employment of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, most notably the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Yuan et al., 2023), has shown promising results, motivating the setup of several pilot studies to explore the use of such models for clinical trial records (CTR) retrieval (Roberts et al., 2022a; Yuan et al., 2023).\nIn practice however, most of the proposed methods still have limited performance with regard to precision and recall, which carries significant ethical implications for clinical applications. Additionally, these methods lack interpretability and control, where the initial hypotheses of being able to analyze a patient's medical history or to understand a trial's eligibility criteria is yet to be confirmed.\nThis paper introduces a novel method for systematic reasoning of trial retrieval and re-ranking that leverages LLMs prompting to initially transform unstructured patient notes and CTRs into attribute sets, thus facilitating the precise mapping, interpretability and scalable retrieval of CTRs that are directly related to a patient's specific medical conditions. The resulting sets of attributes enable a set-guided reasoning process that can deliver a first-stage trial retrieval, expanding the traditional similarity-based approaches (Kusa et al., 2023; Peikos et al., 2023) with hierarchical relationships conveyed by the use of domain-specific knowledge. This overlay of a structured, set-theoretical perspective to LLMs allows for a step-wise and controlled LLM-based inference method for candidate trial interpretation and matching, which allows for a systematic interpretation of both granular (i.e., individual-level) and broad (i.e., entire CTR-level) eligibility criteria.

These patterns are consistent with GPT-3.5. The evidence indicates a clear trend: the inclusion of exclusion criteria labels leads to significant performance degradation, underscoring the substantial discrepancy in LLM performance between labeling exclusion versus inclusion criteria.\nExclusion Criteria Require More Complex Logical Reasoning Than Inclusion Criteria We hypothesize several reasons for the observed complexity of exclusion criteria. The primary challenge lies in their inherently negated nature, where satisfying a criterion involves the absence of a condition. Negation, as a logical construct, has been shown to pose challenges even for SOTA LLMs (Truong et al., 2023). Furthermore, exclusion criteria frequently include double negatives (e.g., \u201cunable to...\" or \"no presence of... \"). This pattern, often mixed with single negation criteria, introduces inconsistency and adds complexity. In contrast, inclusion criteria are typically straightforward assertions.\nTherefore solving inclusion criteria usually involves proving the presence of a condition, relying on direct, measurable observations. However, for exclusion criteria, proving absence is required, which involves ruling out all possibilities. This process is exhaustive and often incomplete, as the absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. While negated inclusion criteria do exist (e.g., the exclusion of a specific disease), they are generally more focused, targeting a specific condition. In contrast, exclusion criteria often encompass broader categories, designed to catch edge cases, which further complicates their application and verification.\nLLMs can support strict deontic principles As shown in Table 2, the scoring function based on an absolute interpretation of deontic principles, GPT-4-turbo Filtered Inclusion Eligibility, exhibited a reduction of -0.045 in NDCG@10, -0.122 in P@10, and -0.358 in P@25 compared to ovc-DF. Despite these reductions, it significantly outperformed the TREC Median, with improvements of +0.134 in NDCG@10, +0.306 in P@10, and +0.247 in MRR.\nWhen accounting for issues related to exclusion criteria, the Filtered Inclusion-Only Eligibility approach outperforms the TREC SOTA, showing gains of +0.019, +0.178, and +0.119 in NDCG@10, P@10, and MRR, respectively. It is important to note that deontic principles are designed not to maximize outcomes at any cost but rather to define transparent, principled intentions and justifications for decisions\u2014what ought to be done.

We present the results of various systems applied to the TREC Clinical Trials Tracks 2022 in Table 5 where we note that a predominant trend is the use of BM25, a well-established probabilistic retrieval model, as the core retrieval mechanism in all but one of the works.\nMechanisms for improving retrieval performance are often necessary when using BM25. Works such as Peikos et al. (2023) and di Nunzio et al. (2022) use query expansion techniques such as RM3 to enhance the initial query representation and improve the initial retrieval. The top 2 approaches in Table 5 also integrate demographic and lifestyle filtering to refine retrieval results based on patient characteristics (Kusa et al., 2023; Herrmannova et al., 2022).\nSimilar to our method, a number of approaches (Peikos et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022; Sin et al., 2022) rely on domain specific knowledge but their focus is on refining query representation. Such methods either fine-tuned BERT-based models, such as ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, and ChatGPT, or use tools like ScispaCy, MedspaCy (Kusa et al., 2023), and the Medical Concept Annotation Tool (Wu et al., 2022) which links to SNOMED-CT.\nThe integration of advanced ranking models alongside traditional retrieval methods is another notable trend. Fine-tuned BERT-based models, such as BioBERT (Kusa et al., 2023), MonoBERT (Nguyen et al., 2022), and MiniLM (Herrmannova et al., 2022), are used to re-rank initial BM25 results, leveraging the deep contextual understanding of transformer-based architectures.\nWith more focus on the recent advancements in LLM research, the current state-of-the-art approach for clinical trial retrieval, as documented by Roberts et al. (2022a), is frocchio monot5 e. However, detailed information about this approach is not available. Another significant contribution is TrialGPT (Jin et al., 2023), a method that uses GPT-4 to assess the patient's eligibility at individual criterion level, re-prompting the LLM to evaluate the overall eligibility, and aggregating the outputs to determine a rank. TrialGPT focuses on second-stage retrieval and ranking, with a reduced search space. This is different from the state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as the TREC 2022 task, where end-to-end retrieval and ranking methods are evaluated on a search space of more than 35,000 studies. Thus, the results reported by TrialGPT are not directly comparable.\nThe approach presented in this paper is an end-to-end process that adheres to the TREC specifications by employing a first-stage retrieval built on BM25, ontology and LLM-based structuring, followed by CT criteria filtering and deontic and LLM-based re-ranking. Crucially, and in contrast to the state-of-the-art in LLM-based CT retrieval, this approach emphasizes the grounding and control of LLM generation, together with the inclusion of domain-relevant explanatory elements in the final ranking, both valuable features in the clinical setting."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion & Future work", "content": "In this paper, we present a novel set-guided reasoning framework for LLMs applied to the retrieval and re-ranking of CTRs.

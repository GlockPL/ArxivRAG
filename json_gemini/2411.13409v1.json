Introduction", "content": "Humans, like all animals and plants, thrive in diverse\necosystems. By asserting that biodiversity extends beyond\nspecies diversity in nature, as well as the diversity of cultures\nand languages within human societies, researchers aspire to\nshow that biodiversity has both biological and cultural\ndimensions [1]. There is a possibility that language death does\nnot occur in privileged communities. It occurs in communities\nthat are disadvantaged and disempowered. Stronger nations,\nand their languages, may not notice the situation because of\ntheir social status. Approximately 290,000 Baltis live in the\nBaltistan division of Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan, where they\nspeak Balti as their mother tongue [2]. Very similar to the\nspoken Balti language, its trans-border sister dialects are spoken\nand understood in the Tibet region of China, India, Nepal,\nMyanmar, and Bhutan because of trade routes, connected\ngeography, religio-cultural and historical basis, and migrations.\nTibetosphere in literature\nare\nSherpa (Nepal), Burmese (Myanmar), Dzongkha (Bhutan),\nLadakhi (India), and Balti (Pakistan) [31]. The number of\nspeakers in these regions is in the millions [30].\nProtecting these dialects is of chief significance as they are not\njust ways of communication but repositories of cultural legacy\nas well [3]. In the face of modernization and globalization,\nwhich intimidate the diversity of minority linguistics, and\ntransfer cultural richness to the next generations it is pertinent\nto preserve and document these dialects given similarities and\ndifferences in linguistic and acoustic perspectives. This paper\naims to highlight the importance of preserving and unifying the\nBalti language and its trans-border sister dialects through the\napplication of artificial intelligence AI. The global community\ntoday has been advantageous with the essence of large language\nModels (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) in finding ways to improve\nand build cultural understanding, unification, and preservation\nof commonalities in traditions, culture, and linguistics [4]. This\narticle also provides some points to the technologists, leaders,\nand politicians who make policies to support the unification and\nrevitalization of endangered languages, dialects, and cultures of\nthe Himalayas, particularly the Tibetosphere."}, {"title": "2. Literature review", "content": "There is a huge literature in classical Tibetan, especially\nin Buddhist literature, spread across areas of the states around\nthe Tibetan region of China. Literature [29] gives an in-depth\nknowledge of various aspects of Tibetan languages, yet it lacks\nsufficient information about Balti as a live dialect of Tibetan\nmentioning certain circumstances, and linguistic and acoustic\npatterns. Branches of the Sino-Tibetan family specifically the\nlanguages under consideration in this study are presented in\nFigure.\nTibetan is mostly influenced by the Buddhist religious culture\nof Tibet and one of the main reasons it flourished for centuries\nto a large region, with classical literature, teaching beliefs by\nthe Monks, and writing scripts found from the past [30, 31].\nHowever, in the last centuries dialects in the neighboring\nregions, specifically the Baltistan and Kargil regions of the\nBalti-speaking majority, lost lots of their cultural aspects\nimpacting the pronunciation, writing script, and code-switching\nwith other languages. What the natives of Tibetosphere today\nbehold is the remains from oral traditions and transfer from\ngeneration to generation. Particularly focusing on Balti, we\nobserve that Balti communities are fragmented through policies\nand political boundaries that influence cultural exchange as\nwell as cross-regional communication [13, 14].\nInitiatives have been taken by governments, local authorities,\nand individuals to promote the literature, writing, and teaching\nof the Balti and the sister dialects in their particular regions.\nOne notable example is the publication of the book \"Balti\nQaida,\" in Baltistan. Building on this, the education ministry in\nJammu and Kashmir later developed a Balti language\ncurriculum for school students [32]. The Quran and Bible also\nbeen translated into Balti. Local poets and writers also been\nproducing literary works in Balti. However, they are all\ntypically written, read, and understood using Perso-Arabic or\nRoman scripts [33].\nComputational studies on Tibetan dialects have extensively\ncovered aspects such as dialect identity, multi-dialect speech\nrecognition, and natural language processing techniques for\nmorphology, translation, and character recognition [34, 35, 36].\nSignificant attention has also been given to Dzongkha and\nBurmese [40, 41]. However, this level of computational and\ntechnical research is notably absent for dialects spoken outside\nTibet, such as those in Nepal, India, and specifically Baltistan.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no computational\nlinguistic work on the Balti language to date. Similarly, dialects\nlike Sherpa and Bodhi in Nepal, Bhutan, and India have\nprimarily been the focus of academic research, particularly\nconcerning their morphological, phonological, and\ngrammatical features, as well as translation and transliteration\nrelationships with other languages [37]."}, {"title": "3. Linguistic analysis", "content": "Balti is a relatively under-researched language in the field of\nlinguistics. However, some existing literature presents root\nwords gathered using corpus data from both documented and\nnaturalistic resources, as well as tense markers [38, 39] and\nwriting styles [33]. Additionally, some books document Balti\ntraditions, grammar, history, and stories [15]. This body of\nwork provides a foundation for further investigation and can be\nutilized in computational studies of linguistic dynamics.\nDespite this, there is a notable absence of linguistic and spoken\ndatasets specifically for the Balti language spoken in Baltistan,\nwhich poses a challenge for conducting comprehensive\nresearch on this language.\nAs given in Table 1, it is observed that Mostly nouns are similar\nin almost all the dialects given. For instance, \"meat\" is spoken\nin the similar pronunciation \"sha\", and when called \"Beef\"\nthere seem variations, but the native speakers understand what\nis behind the variation. Like \"Bull\" or \"Ox\" is commonly\nnamed \"Ba\" in Balti, Ladakhi, Dzongkha and Sherpa. But\n\"Bull\" is also known with another name \"Glang, Lang\" in these\ngeographies, so the Tibetana and Bhutanese use \u201cGlang+sha\u201d\ninstead of \"Ba+sha\"; whereas in Burmese, \"meat\" is\npronounced in a similar way \"Sha\" but the written abugida is\n\"a-sarr\", so when its \"beef\", linguistically \"ox or bull meat\", it\nis written with the prefix for \"Ox\" as \"aamell+sarr\". It can be\nconcluded that mainly five countries, other than Myanmar, have\nmajor similarities in written and spoken forms. Despite\ndifferent writing ways, pronunciation, and lexical differences,\nthe Tibetan and Burmese have almost similar consonants [20]\nalong with Balti and IPA; likewise, the number system is the\nsame, and even pronounced similarly (from 0 to 9) all across\nthe Tibetosphere, except Bhutan and Burma with few variations\nfrom the rest [21]. In Baltistan Balti language is significantly\ninfluenced by Urdu and Persian, and interestingly many Balti\nphonetic dialects have similar effects on these languages locally\n[26,27], like providing exclusive vowel sounds and softer\nconsonants; however, Tibetan is influenced strongly by\nMandarin, and Ladakhi with guttural sounds and tonal\nvariations [17]. So unique phonetic traits are preserved from\ncommunities across generations and also reveal socio-cultural\ndistinctions and regional differences. Studies in literature [33,\n42, 43], as presented in Table 2, describe variations and\nsimilarities in depth.\nBalti Language shows important similarities with Sherpa,\nLadakhi, and Dzongkha and illuminates common linguistic\nheritage features more than the dialects in the Tibeto-Burman\nfamily.

Adopting AI Technology\nTechnological advancements, particularly the advent of\nartificial intelligence, have made it possible to bridge gaps,\nunify similarities, and strengthen ties across geo-political,\nreligious, and generational boundaries. In the context of Balti\nand its sister dialects, there is a pressing need for dialect\nunification, leveraging the power of technology. Automatic\nSpeech Recognition (ASR) has proven effective in recognizing\ntraditional speech, accents, dialects, and various spoken\nlanguage varieties. Similarly, Natural Language Processing\n(NLP) has proven a crucial role for processing and analyzing\nlinguistic perspectives. NLP aids in developing culturally\nsensitive models, and by utilizing linguistics, statistics, and\nartificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated the ability to understand text meanings and mimic\nhuman languages [4]. From variations in phonological and\nphonetics, speech recognition can enhance speech from\ndifferent dialects.\nOral culture can be protected and mapped through audio\narchives to support language learning by having real-time\nfeedback. Tibetan dialects across the formal Tibetan region\nwithin China have already worked on speech and linguistic\nperspectives with great accuracy [34,36]. Likewise, Burmese\nand Dzongkha (Bhutanese) dialects also got considerable\ndigitization in the past. For instance, corpus development for\nspeech recognition of Dzongkha was found in the literature,\nword segmentation, and text-to-speech [40,44]. Pre-trained\nmodels for the Myanmar language have also been studied in\nmultiple pieces of literature [41], also local dialects of\nMyanmar have been explored [13]. Similar strategies adopted\nto match similarities and variations in linguistic and acoustic\nperspectives across the Balti and other sister dialects can lead\nto a unified system of dialogue and understanding between the\ncommunities spread with geo-political boundaries.\nIt is observed that large language models (LLMs) are used to\nteach varied linguistic information, translate text, and facilitate\ncommunication across different dialects [22], taking advantage\nof which, the understanding and communication gap can be\naddressed by unifying the differences and developing dialect-\nspecific glossaries and dictionaries. A recently published\nliterature [23] demonstrates the dialectic gap in the performance\nof LLM-based machine translation and automatic speech\nrecognition for several dialects, including Arabic, Mandarin,\nFinnish, German, Bengali, Tagalog, and Portuguese. Along\nwith the LLMs integrated with ASR and NLP tasks, Multi-\nModal techniques have recently made great advancements\n[39,42], helping in language analysis with the help of text,\naudio, and visual data to understand dialects. So by using\nadvanced models, technology, and Al we can preserve and\nunify Balti and sister dialects, enhance cultural heritage, and\nmeasure linguistic diversity. It also helps to transfer Balti-\nspeaking culture to future generations."}, {"title": "4.2 Strategies for Unification", "content": "Different strategies have been applied for unifying dialects,\nsuch as creating a standardized dictionary that contains\ncommon phrases and words and also has proper meanings and\npronunciations of full words present in the dictionary [24].\nSimilarly, building standard phonetics via technical tools and\nacoustic analyses [30,25]. However, recognition and writing\nstandards are maintained through unified scripts that have\nsyntactic and phonetic features of all targeted dialects,\npromoting standard written communication. Transliteration\ntools and OCR software have been traditional ways of text\nconversion and recognition and also assist in transmitting the\ngiven text into new forms of script and making pronunciation\nlexicon in speech recognition, identification, and\nunderstanding. These approaches altogether support a unified\nlinguistic and cultural uniqueness while protecting the wealthy\ntradition of the Balti-speaking society.\nLLMs assist not only in textual communication mediums, rather\nit offers great advancements in spoken language understanding,\nrecognition, identification addressing dialectal, age, sex,\nmedium and other variations. Hence the similarities of Balti and\nsister dialects can also be matched and unified. It is essential to\nprocess required speech and text data, for the said tasks, process\nthem using sophisticated algorithms like seq2seq transformer\nmodels by the open source multilingual Whisper model\n(Radford, 2023), and similar level competitive yet effective\nstrategies in Wav2Vec2 by Meta AI (Baevski, 2020)."}, {"title": "5. Cultural and demographic impacts", "content": "Unifying Balti and sister dialects can have a great impact both\nculturally and demographically. Cultural heritage can be\npreserved through a unified language, even though traditional\ninformation, values, and folklore are constantly acknowledged\nand transmitted. By unity of the dialects, countries and societies\nwhere Balti and sister dialects are spoken and understood can\nbridge the cultural gap, and have firm bonding and mutual\nunderstandings. Enhanced communication within and among\nthese zones simplifies connections in learning about their\ncommon history, ecology, environmental effects, common\nvalues, and community settings. Furthermore, a united\nlanguage strengthens communal solidity and uniqueness,\npromoting a joint cultural inheritance and harmony. This\nagreement supports local firmness and collaboration,\ndecreasing social division and fostering mutual struggles in\naddressing challenges, thus contributing to in general regional\npeace and synchronization."}, {"title": "6. Conclusion and prospects", "content": "By the fusion of Balti and sister dialects, with the help of\ntechnological and Al expansions, major linguistic, historical,\nand cultural advantages are possibly offered to the speakers of\nthese trans-border sister dialects. This study emphasizes the\nsignificance of establishing phonetic norms, consistent\ndictionaries, and unified scripts to protect cultural heritage and\nimprove communication.

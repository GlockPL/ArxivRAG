This gap hinders their productivity, profitability, and adoption of sustainable\npractices, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where farming technologies require local adaptation based\non plot-specific factors [11, 21]. The lack of reliable guidance limits farmers' ability to assess risks and leads to lower\nyields and incomes [5, 37, 49].\nAgricultural extension services aim to bridge this gap by providing farmers with knowledge and resources [6, 60, 73].\nHowever, traditional services depend on extension agents who face challenges in delivering timely, tailored advice,\nespecially in remote areas where factors like soil, climate, and crop variety differ greatly, making it hard to provide\nprecise recommendations [26, 47, 50, 58].\nRecent efforts have explored information and communication technologies (ICTs) [34, 61, 62, 71, 74], such as SMS\nreminders [39, 42, 70] and video learning programs [10, 30], to enhance agricultural extension. While promising, these\nmethods rely on curated content and human mediation, limiting scalability and adaptability. There is a growing need\nfor conversational systems that can process diverse data and handle various inquiries, particularly for low-literacy\nusers who require natural language interactions and access to dynamic knowledge bases [62]. Traditional chatbots and\nmodels often fall short due to high resource demands and the need for human intervention [30, 62].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) powered by Generative AI (GenAI) offer a transformative solution [15, 69]. Using\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [22], LLMs can process unstructured data-such as documents, crop tables, and\nvideos-providing contextually relevant, accurate, and personalized information. These systems create a seamless user\nexperience through natural dialogue, guiding farmers with tailored, adaptive interactions while ensuring the advice is\ntrustworthy and actionable.\nWe present Farmer.Chat, a generative AI-powered chatbot designed to address key challenges in traditional agricul-\ntural extension services. Offering a scalable and customizable solution, it provides smallholder farmers with timely,\nreliable, and context-specific information. Unlike prior chatbots [36, 46, 79] that rely on human mediation, Farmer.Chat\ndelivers on-demand, tailored agricultural advice across multiple platforms, including messaging apps and mobile appli-\ncations. This design overcomes geographical limitations, scalability issues, and dependence on human intermediaries,\nenhancing access to agricultural knowledge for marginalized groups like women and low-literacy users.\nFarmer.Chat leverages RAG technology to process structured and unstructured data-such as research papers, crop\ntables, and videos-building a dynamic and adaptable knowledge base. With multilingual support and multimedia\nresponses (text, audio, video), it ensures accessibility for diverse users, particularly those with low literacy. Localized\nknowledge bases ensure region-specific, accurate advice tailored to local agricultural practices.\nDeployed in four countries-Kenya, India, Ethiopia, and Nigeria-Farmer.Chat engages over 15,000 farmers and has\naddressed more than 300,000 queries. Available in six languages, it serves diverse communities, covering over 40 value\nchain crops, and demonstrates its capacity to scale globally while providing relevant, accessible agricultural support.\nThis paper focuses on our Kenya deployment, started in October 2023, which now has the largest user base of 8,805\nusers across seven counties. These users are categorized into four groups:\n(1) Agriculture Extension Agents (EAs): Employed by Kenya's Ministry of Agriculture, EAs disseminate agri-\ncultural knowledge but face high farmer-to-agent ratios-ranging from 1:1,000 to 1:5,000 [33, 51]-making it\nchallenging to reach all farmers.\n(2) Lead Farmers: To bridge this gap, a farmer-to-farmer extension model selects Lead Farmers based on experience\nand leadership, each supporting 15-30 farmers with information from EAs.\n(3) Farmers: The main beneficiaries, receiving personalized agricultural advice via Farmer.Chat to enhance their\npractices.\n(4) Agripreneurs: A developing group introducing innovative technologies and market access, driving agricultural\ntransformation.\nThis paper addresses the following core research questions: (RQ1.) How can generative Al enhance the scalability,\naccessibility, and contextual relevance of agricultural extension services? (RQ2.) What are the key factors influencing\nuser trust, engagement, and long-term adoption of AI-driven agricultural advisory tools like Farmer.Chat? (RQ3.) How\ndoes the deployment of Farmer.Chat impact agricultural outcomes, farmer satisfaction, and community-level adoption\nacross diverse regions?\nThe key contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we introduce Farmer.Chat, a novel Al-driven agricultural\nextension platform that uses Generative AI to deliver multilingual, multimodal interactions and contextually relevant,"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "In this section, we review research on (1) Agricultural Extension Services and ICT Interventions, (2) Chatbots and\nConversation Agents and (3) Generative AI in Agriculture, thus contextualizing the key novelty of Farmer.Chat."}, {"title": "2.1 Agricultural Extension Services and ICT Interventions", "content": "Traditional agricultural extension services have been essential in disseminating knowledge to farmers [6, 60]. However,\nin many low- and middle-income countries, they face significant challenges, such as limited reach due to an insufficient\nnumber of extension agents [26, 47]. In Kenya, for example, the agent-to-farmer ratio is estimated at 1:1000 according\nto government reports (NASEP 2012 [13]), but it can be as high as 1:4,000 [29, 48], far below the recommended ratio of\n1:400. Additionally, these services tend to be top-down, limiting farmer input and reducing engagement [47]. While\npeer-learning models like farmer field schools aim to address these gaps, they often face resource limitations and\ninconsistent results due to varying farming contexts such as soil, climate, and crop variety [24, 80, 81].\nIn response to these limitations, ICT-based interventions have been developed to scale agricultural knowledge\ndissemination [62, 71]. Mobile solutions like SMS and voice-based systems have shown promise in delivering timely,\nlocalized information. In Kenya, SMS reminders increased sugarcane yields by 8% and boosted revenue by US$54 per\nfarmer at a cost of just US$0.02 per message [78]. Similarly, a voice-based system for cotton farmers in India demonstrated\nhigh adoption rates, especially among low-literacy users [54, 55]. Despite their success, these ICT solutions rely on\ncurated content, limiting adaptability to changing agricultural conditions [63].\nPeer-to-peer video learning models have also improved adoption rates by using locally produced, farmer-led videos\nto share context-specific knowledge [30]. Studies show video-enabled extension is ten times more cost-effective than\ntraditional services, reducing the cost per adoption from US$35 to US$3.50 and reaching 30% more farmers [14]. However,\nproducing high-quality, localized videos is resource-intensive, and reliance on human facilitators limits scalability [32].\nWhile ICT and peer-learning interventions have enhanced agricultural extension, scalability and adaptability\nchallenges persist. AI-driven solutions like Farmer.Chat can address these issues by providing scalable, cost-effective,\nand context-aware support, meeting the growing need for effective agricultural extension services."}, {"title": "2.2 Chatbots and Conversation Agents in Agriculture", "content": "Chatbots and conversational agents are increasingly used in agriculture for providing accessible information through\nnatural language interactions. Projects like Hello Tractor and Avaaj Otalo offer real-time advice on topics such as\nweather, pest control, and farming techniques via voice or text systems [36, 54, 55].\nWhile rule-based chatbots are useful for structured, repetitive tasks, they struggle with complex, dynamic queries\nthat require context-awareness. Systems like Avaaj Otalo handle voice queries but are limited in adapting to evolving\nagricultural needs [54]. Similarly, FarmChat faces challenges in offering personalized advice due to variables like soil"}, {"title": "2.3 Generative Al in Agriculture", "content": "Advancements in generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 [1], are transforming\nagricultural knowledge accessibility, especially in low-resource settings. Projects like Kisan.AI [40] have deployed LLMs\nto offer real-time advice on crop management and pest control [40]. However, these systems face challenges in adapting\nto diverse agricultural ecosystems due to limited knowledge bases and difficulties in ingesting non-digital agricultural\ninformation. Additionally, the lack of robust multilingual support and the inability to handle multimodal inputs, such as\nimages and audio, further restricts their usefulness in rural contexts [59].\nMost existing LLM-based agricultural chatbots focus on a narrow range of crops and regions, neglecting the complex\nneeds of smallholder farmers [69, 77]. Their inability to integrate localized weather and soil data reduces their precision\nin providing actionable insights. Farmer.Chat addresses these limitations by supporting multiple crops, integrating real-\ntime weather and soil data, and delivering personalized recommendations. Its multilingual and multimodal capabilities\n(audio, image, video) make it accessible to low-literacy users, crucial in rural settings. Using Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) for structured and unstructured data, Farmer.Chat enhances trustworthiness and precision.\nFinally, designing AI-driven tools for low-literacy, resource-constrained populations requires intuitive, culturally\nsensitive interfaces. Prior studies [45, 53, 54, 67] demonstrate the effectiveness of voice-based systems and image-based\ninterfaces for increasing engagement. Further, several research highlights the importance of culturally relevant, trust-\nbuilding designs for sustainable use [7, 8, 35]. Jackson et al. [35] and Sambasivan et al. [16] stress the need for AI tools\nto align with local practices and function well in resource-limited environments. Dell et al. [12] underscore offline\nfunctionality, while Amershi et al. [4] advocate for clear feedback and user control.

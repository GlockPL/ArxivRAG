Unlike data-\ndriven approaches such as machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), which derive patterns from vast\namounts of unstructured data, symbolic AI models intelligence is based on rule-based systems that explicitly define\nrules, relationships, and logical structures. These structures include formal logic, ontologies, and semantic networks,\nenabling symbolic AI to work with well-defined rules to draw logical conclusions and make interpretable decisions [7].\nA core component of symbolic AI is knowledge representation, where symbols denote real-world entities and their\nrelationships. Representations in symbolic AI often employ hierarchical or graph-based structures such as semantic\nnetworks or ontologies [1, 15]. In contrast, LLMs GPT4 [22] and BERT [6], while highly effective in generating\ncontextually relevant responses, face challenges in offering the same level of explainability due to their \"black box\"\nnature [32]. This gap is particularly concerning in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and legal reasoning,\nwhere trust and transparency are paramount.\nThis gap between the complexity of LLMs and the demand for transparency poses a significant challenge for AI\ndevelopment, particularly given the legal requirements imposed by regulations like the EU's General Data Protection"}, {"title": "State-of-the-Art in LLM Reasoning", "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving breakthrough performance\non tasks like translation, summarization, and question-answering through in-context learning, a new paradigm that\nenables few-shot learning without modifying model parameters [24, 26, 29]. These models have demonstrated\nexceptional proficiency in what Kahneman [17] describes as \u201cSystem 1\u201d tasks \u2013 automatic, intuitive operations \u2013 but\nhave faced challenges in \"System 2\u201d reasoning tasks, which require conscious, logical steps, such as solving math word\nproblems [4].\nRecent developments in prompt-based reasoning, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, have been instrumental\nin addressing these challenges. By guiding LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps, CoT has significantly\nimproved performance on reasoning-intensive benchmarks, such as the GSM8K dataset for math word problems [29].\nThis approach, along with advances in self-consistency and prompt-engineering techniques, has helped bridge the gap\nbetween LLMs' ability to perform associative tasks and their capacity for multi-step reasoning [18].\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain in ensuring the faithfulness and interpretability of reasoning processes\nin LLMs. Techniques like self-verification and reinforcement learning have been employed to minimize errors and\nimprove reliability, but issues such as hallucination and error accumulation persist, particularly in complex, multi-step\nreasoning tasks [28]. Additionally, research continues to explore how reasoning capabilities can be transferred to smaller\nmodels or embodied agents, as computational efficiency becomes an increasingly important factor in the deployment of\nLLMs [20].\nThe proposed pipeline enhances the state-of-the-art by addressing some of the core challenges faced by LLMs,\nparticularly in ensuring explainability and trustworthiness in reasoning tasks. Unlike traditional LLM systems, the\npipeline integrates domain expert knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation, and formal reasoning frameworks,\nenabling the system to verify and refine its outputs through external data and structured reasoning. This multi-layered\napproach mitigates some of the inherent issues in LLMs, such as hallucination and over-reliance on probabilistic\nreasoning.

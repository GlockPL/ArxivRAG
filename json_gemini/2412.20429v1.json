For example, Burghart et al (2005) have\ndemonstrated a three-level cognitive architecture that from\nenvironmental input to task execution"}, {"title": null, "content": "However, current technology supports humanoid robots to\nimitate humans to perform repetitive operations, but it does\nnot mean that the simulation reaches human-level cognitive\nautonomy (Katiyar & Katiyar, 2021; Ogunsina et al., 2024).\nThe perception and execution capabilities cannot make up for\nthe significant challenges in human-level autonomy that are\nreflected in cognitive abilities such as thinking, planning, and\ndecision-making (Ogunsina et al., 2024). Target perception,\ntracking, and repetitive movement planning still rely on visual\nprocessing (Guo et al., 2020). Humanoid robots are not only\nbased on pre-trained architectural models of static data, but\nalso need to process multi-modal data (visual, auditory, tactile)\nand flexible and coherent reasoning (Fisher et al., 2021; Xiao\net al., 2023).\nThe technical shortcomings of multimodal understanding\nare the key gaps that make it difficult for humanoid robots to\nachieve cognitive autonomy. Multimodal understanding\nrequires extracting relevant features from different sensory\ninputs and integrating them into a consistent semantic\nrepresentation through cross-modal alignment techniques\n(Duan et al., 2022; Navarro-Guerrero et al., 2023; Tong et al.,\n2024). However, in practice, it is difficult to efficiently\nintegrate and process multi-modal data such as visual,\nauditory and tactile data, resulting in ambiguous semantics\nand incoherent responses.\nAs mentioned before, architectures that rely on static\npre-training data to complete tasks lack the ability to integrate\ncross-modal data (Ye et al., 2023). This directly causes\nsemantic ambiguity when humanoid robots process feedback\nwith hearing or touch or response incoherence (Pramanick &\nRossi, 2024). Although some research attempts multi-modal\nfusion technology, progress is still limited and is not enough to\nprovide humanoid robots with the same adaptive capabilities\nas humans (Yuan et al., 2024). To address this gap, this\nresearch proposes a multi-scenario reasoning architecture as\nan innovative solution. It aims to leverage multi-scenario\nreasoning to optimize the key challenges of cognitive\nautonomy in humanoid robots' cross-modal understanding of\nvisual, auditory and tactile data based on current technology\nshortcomings."}, {"title": "II.MULTI-SCENARIO REASONING", "content": null}, {"title": "A.

The human brain's response to situations The\nconstruction and integration process of semantics is carried\nout in the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and parietal lobe\n(Jouen et al., 2015). The memory retrieval and contextual\nassociation of the hippocampus play an important role in\nprocessing environmental information for cross-modal\nreasoning in multiple scenes (Morici et al., 2022). This process\ninvolves the dynamic allocation of attention resources to\nensure the human brain's immediate understanding of complex\nsituations and selected optimal actions, which profoundly\naffects the operation process of the multi-scenario reasoning\narchitecture designed in this research (Nicolini et al., 2024).\nAs mentioned before, the principle of multi-scenario\nreasoning is inspired by situated cognition theory, thereby\nextending its application to the cognitive autonomy design of\nhumanoid robots.

In the field of\nhumanoid robots, the application of multi-scenario reasoning\nfocuses on global situation modeling based on multi-modal\ndata, and uses this to perform continuous reasoning and\ndynamic adjustment. Multi-scenario reasoning promotes\ncognitive autonomy in complex environments through\nsemantic alignment, synchronized processing and scenarios\nof multi-modal data during thinking, planning and\ndecision-making.\nThe core principle of multi-scene reasoning lies in\ndynamic scene modeling and semantic integration of\nmulti-modal data, thereby solving the key shortcomings of\nexisting multi-modal understanding technology. Based on the\nprinciple of situated cognition theory, this concept simulates\nthe semantic integration and decision-making of the human\nbrain in an uncertain environment. From a technical practice\nperspective, it is based on semantic alignment and uses\nsituational analysis to uniformly represent visual, auditory\nand tactile data, which optimizes the robot's cross-modal\nunderstanding capabilities.Sparse attention effectively\noptimizes and dynamically adjusts the weight of each\nmodality to highlight key information, thereby improving the\naccuracy and efficiency of multi-modal data processing\n(Song et al., 2024).

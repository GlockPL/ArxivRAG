Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods [23] fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise.

Since downscaling generates high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, statistical downscaling uses statistical methods to establish relationships between coarse-resolution climate data and high-resolution historical observations. The regional downscaling problem is vital for developing comprehensive climate policies and strategies. The impacts of climate change, as predicted by global climate models, range from extreme weather events to rises in sea levels and shifts in agricultural productivity. Enhancing the spatial precision of climate data is vital for accurately assessing risks in specific regions. Decision-makers require such information to strategize how communities can successfully mitigate and adapt to these threats. For example, coastal areas worldwide face severe risks associated with sea-level rise, where even small changes can lead to significant flooding, erosion, and habitat loss [16, 32]. High-resolution data contributes to accurate regional predictions of this risk, essential for effective coastal management, infrastructure planning, and disaster preparedness.\nThe problem of statistical downscaling in climate data is challenging due to climate data's inherent complexity and variability involving intricate spatial and temporal dependencies influenced by numerous physical processes (e.g., ocean currents, wind patterns, temperature gradients, and coastal topography). The non-stationarity of climate data, driven by dynamic changes in climate patterns and extreme events, further complicates the development of reliable and robust downscaling techniques. For example, statistical properties like mean and standard deviation may not be constant over time [3, 25]. Traditional Kriging and interpolation-based methods [27, 46, 50] for downscaling sea-level rise data often fall short due to their reliance on stationarity assumptions and their inability to capture the dynamic nature of climate data. These methods typically smooth the data excessively, resulting in the loss of critical fine-scale features. The loss leads to an inaccurate representation of the underlying physical processes, such as ocean currents, wind patterns, and temperature gradients. On the other hand, machine learning-based methods [22, 51, 53], while powerful in capturing non-linear relationships, often struggle with generalization and maintaining physical consistency. These models can be data-hungry and sensitive to the quality and quantity of training data.\nTraditional super-resolution models, designed primarily for image processing, cannot be directly applied to climate downscaling for the following reasons. (a) They lack physical constraints and fail to incorporate the complex, nonlinear relationships between various components of the Earth system [5, 31]. (b) They do not handle the high-dimensional nature of climate data effectively and often require large amounts of high-resolution training data, typically sparse in climate science [52]. (c) They are deterministic and do not provide probabilistic outputs or uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for climate predictions [28]. (d) They lack generalization across different regions and periods, as they do not account for the multiple scales inherent in climate processes [21].\nTo address these limitations, we propose a Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM), which combines the strengths of Kriging's spatial interpolation capabilities with the flexibility and robustness of conditional diffusion processes. Ki-CDPM effectively captures spatial variability, maintains physical consistency, handles high-dimensional data, and provides probabilistic outputs, ensuring more accurate and physically consistent downscaling of climate data.\nContributions: The paper contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) that leverages Kriging interpolation for fine-scale projections.\n\u2022 We introduce Variogram-Based Regularization to capture spatial variability in regional processes and enhance the physical consistency of downscaled data.\n\u2022 We compare the Ki-CDPM against state-of-the-art machine learning models and conduct comprehensive evaluations in different regions, demonstrating its effectiveness.\nRelevance to SIGSPATIAL: This paper is relevant to SIGSPATIAL for the following reasons:\n\u2022 The paper proposes a novel approach to addressing the challenge of downscaling climate data, which aligns with the fields of remote sensing, earth observation, spatial data mining, and knowledge discovery\n\u2022 Models used in the paper (e.g., diffusion models) have been explored recently in SIGSPATIAL with promising results in graph forecasting [54] and urban flow [55].\n\u2022 Challenges described in the paper (e.g., spatial variability) have been studied recently in SIGSPATIAL (e.g., [24]).\n\u2022 The paper integrates geostatistical methods and deep learning models, aligning with SIGSPATIAL's focus on GeoAI.\nScope: This paper focuses on the statistical downscaling of climate variables like sea-level rise and ocean eddy energy. Temporal downscaling is not addressed in this manuscript but will be explored in future work. This study does not explore physics-informed machine-learning methods for downscaling or does not simulate the temporal evolution of physical processes. Additional physical constraints can be added to the proposed method to explore downscaling climate variables with conservation properties.\nOrganization: The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces basic concepts and provides the problem formulation.

A Sea-Level Rise or Sea-Level Elevation Map is a raster map that provides information on the average increase in the water level of the Earth's oceans. Sea level is the height of the sea surface relative to a standardized baseline, typically the mean sea level. It is measured using satellite altimetry, tide gauges, and GPS data, which require advanced algorithms for integrating and correcting various environmental factors. Understanding sea level elevation is crucial for climate research, disaster management, and urban planning and involves complex data processing, modeling, and predictive analytics [10].\nDEFINITION 2.2. A coarse-scale resolution is a $N \\times N$ grid-based representation of a climate variable (e.g., sea-level elevation) for a given geographic region (R) projection.\nDEFINITION 2.3. A fine-scale resolution is an $M \\times M$ (where $M > N$) grid-based representation of a climate variable (e.g., sea-level elevation) for a given geographic region (R) projection.\nDEFINITION 2.4. Downscaling in climate science derives fine-scale resolution data from coarse-resolution variables [25].\nThe problem of downscaling a climate variable (e.g., sea-level elevation) is formally defined as follows:\nInput:\n(1) Coarse-Resolution climate data ($\\tilde{y}$)\n(2) A diffusion model to output a downscaled climate dataset ($x_{\\text{high}}$) which is an approximation of the ground truth ($x_{\\text{high}}$)\nOutput: High-resolution downscaled climate data ($x_{\\text{high}}$) as an approximation of the ground truth data ($x_{\\text{high}}$)\nObjective: Solution quality, model generalization\nConstraints: (1) Spatial variability; (2) Domain adaptability; (3) Model interpretability\nInverse Problem: Downscaling sea-level rise projections from coarse-resolution climate models to finer regional scales can be thought of as an inverse problem aimed at estimating high-resolution sea-level changes based on limited low-resolution observations and a forward model [18, 25]. This problem is complex due to nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs, sparse and unevenly distributed observations, and model errors and uncertainties [3, 5, 31, 40]. Additionally, the high-dimensional nature of the problem poses computational challenges [21]. These factors make sea-level rise data downscaling an ill-posed inverse problem, which requires advanced techniques for reliable high-resolution projections [28, 52]."}, {"title": "3 Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model", "content": "This section will introduce a novel architecture based on Kriging interpolation as a conditional input to preserve spatial variability while transforming coarser-resolution climate variables (e.g., sea-level elevation) to finer-scale resolution.

The objective is to learn a parametric approximation of $p(x|y)$ via stochastic refinements which iteratively maps source condition $y$ to a target output $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ via denoising diffusion probabilistic (DDPM) model [14, 41].", "title_level": 2}, {"title": "3.2 Interpolation with Kriging", "content": "Universal Kriging (U-Krig) is an advanced geostatistical method that allows for interpolation by accounting for deterministic trends and spatial correlation in the data. For instance, let $\\tilde{y}$ represent a coarser resolution map and $y$ represent a finer resolution map. We then model the trend using a second-order polynomial function of the spatial coordinates:\n$m(s) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + \\beta_2y + \\beta_3x^2 + \\beta_4y^2 + \\beta_5xy$ (12)\nWhere x and y are the spatial coordinates (longitude and latitude), and $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\beta_4, \\beta_5$ are the coefficients to be estimated. Hence, the residuals $y(s_i)$ are calculated by subtracting the estimated trend $m(s)$ from the observed sea-level elevations $\\tilde{y}(s_i)$:\n$y(s_i) = \\tilde{y}(s_i) - m(s_i)$ (13)\nThese residuals represent the deviations from the deterministic trend and are used to model the spatial correlation structure.\nWe then use the spatial correlation of the residuals, which is quantified using the experimental variogram. The semivariance $\\Delta(h)$ for different lag distances $h$ is computed as:\n$\\Delta(h) = \\frac{1}{2N(h)} \\sum_{i=1}^{N(h)} [y(s_i) - y(s_i + h)]^2$ (14)\nWhere $N(h)$ is the number of pairs of points separated by a distance h, and $y(s_i)$ are the residuals. The experimental variogram is fitted with a theoretical Mat\u00e9rn variogram model, defined as:\n$\\Delta(h) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2^{v-1}\\Gamma(v)} \\bigg( \\frac{h}{p} \\bigg)^v K_v\\bigg( \\frac{h}{p} \\bigg) + C_0$ (15)\nwhere $v$ is the smoothness parameter, $p$ is the range parameter, $\\sigma^2$ is the partial sill, $C_0$ is the nugget, and $K_v$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Once the variogram parameters $(v, p, \\sigma^2, C_0)$ are estimated by fitting the Mat\u00e9rn variogram model to the experimental variogram, they are used to calculate the semivariances $\\gamma(s_i - s_j)$ between all pairs of sampled locations. These semivariances form the basis of the Kriging system of equations. We use the Universal Kriging system to predict the sea-level elevation at unsampled locations with a higher resolution. The predicted value $y(s_0)$ at location $s_0$ is given by:\n$y(s_0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i \\tilde{y}(s_i) + \\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\mu_k f_k(s_0)$ (16)\nwhere $\\lambda_i$ are the Kriging weights, $\\mu_k$ are the Lagrange multipliers for the trend functions, and $f_k(s_0)$ are the basis functions for the trend model. The weights $\\lambda_i$ are obtained by solving the system of equations:\n$\\begin{cases} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lambda_j \\gamma(s_i - s_j) + \\sum_{k=1}^{p} \\mu_k f_k(s_i) = \\gamma(s_i - s_0) \\text{ for } i = 1,..., n \\\\ \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\lambda_j f_k(s_j) = f_k(s_0) \\text{ for } k = 1,..., p\\end{cases}$\nwhere $\\gamma(s_i - s_j)$ is the semivariance between locations $s_i$ and $s_j$.\nFinally, we apply the Universal Kriging weights to interpolate the sea-level elevation data to a higher resolution. This interpolated map $y$ is used as a conditional input to the diffusion model, which then controls the generation in the reverse diffusion process to retain the spatial dependencies."}, {"title": "3.3 Proposed Model Architecture", "content": "The Ki-CDPM extends the CDPM by incorporating a conditioned input obtained from Universal-Kriging (U-Krig) on the coarse-resolution elevation map $\\tilde{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times M}$ providing local variability for the climate variable.

The U-Net can leverage the spatially variable information provided by the U-Krig-based elevation map y to guide the generation of a fine-scale resolution map capturing spatial dependencies via leveraging the strengths of geostatistical information into the diffusion modeling framework."}, {"title": "3.4 Proposed Variogram-based Regularization", "content": "Variational Lower Bound (LVLB): Considering the forward diffusion process as a set approximate posterior within the inference mechanism, it is possible to establish the ensuing variational lower bound for the marginal log-likelihood:\n$\\mathbb{E}_{(x_0,y)} \\log p_\\theta(x_0|y) \\geq \\mathbb{E}_{y,x_0} \\mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T}/x_0)} \\log \\frac{p(x_T)}{q(x_1/x_0)}\n+ \\sum_{t \\geq 1} \\log \\frac{p_\\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t, y)}{q(x_t/x_{t-1})}$ (17)\nAccording to the specific parameterization of the inference process described earlier, the negative variational lower bound can be simplified and expressed as a loss function.

The regularization term $R_v$ penalizes the discrepancy between the empirical variogram of the generated noisy elevation maps (in the reverse process) and the variogram from the observed high-resolution map. Let $\\Delta_{x_t}(h)$ denote the empirical variogram of the generated elevation map $x_t$ at step t, calculated as:\n$\\Delta_{x_t}(h) = \\frac{1}{2|N(h)|} \\sum_{(s_i,s_j)\\in N(h)} (x_t(s_i) - x_t(s_j))^2$ (19)\nwhere N(h) is the set of location pairs separated by the lag vector h, and $|\\cdot|$ denotes the cardinality of a set.\nLet $\\Delta_{x_0}(h)$ denote the variogram of the observed map ($x_0$) evaluated at lag h:\n$\\Delta_{x_0}(h) = \\frac{1}{2|N(h)|} \\sum_{(s_i,s_j)\\in N(h)} (x_0(s_i) - x_0(s_j))^2$ (20)"}, {"title": "4 Experimental Evaluation", "content": "Experimental Goal: Our experimental goal was to compare the solution quality of downscaling from our proposed Ki-CDPM model against state-of-the-art downscaling methods and provide both qualitative and quantitative analysis.", "title_level": 1}, {"title": "4.1 Experiment Design", "content": "Datasets: Our experimental evaluation focused on downscaling two key climate variables: sea-level anomaly (SLA) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). We use high-resolution Copernicus and CMIP6 datasets and examined various sub-regions, including Eastern North America (ENA), western North America (WNA), and the Bay of Bengal (BoB) [17], an area particularly vulnerable to coastal flooding, due to the absence of ground truth data for climate models and the need for bias correction. We tested our methodology on satellite observations where the ground truth is known. Climate model outputs on sea level change are biased in the mean and variability, and the ground truth is unknown for high-resolution sea level values. Hence, we did not downscale climate model output in this study. Future studies will utilize high-resolution climate model outputs for training datasets as these high-resolution models are currently being tested[6].\nThe Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) dataset offers comprehensive global sea level anomaly data derived from satellite altimetry measurements. This dataset spans from 1993 to now and provides daily and monthly mean estimates of sea level anomalies. These anomalies are calculated with respect to a twenty-year reference sea level using absolute standards. The data is essential for monitoring the long-term evolution of sea levels and analyzing ocean and climate indicators. It includes sea level anomalies, absolute dynamic topography, and geostrophic velocities, which are crucial for approximating ocean surface currents. The dataset is updated approximately three times a year with a delay of about five months to ensure accuracy and stability [44, 45].\nThe CMIP6 HighResMIP versions of EC-Earth provide global high-resolution coupled climate data developed by the EC-Earth consortium. The dataset includes EC-Earth3P-HR, with a high resolution of approximately 40 km for the atmosphere and 0.25 degrees for the ocean, and a standard-resolution version, EC-Earth3P, with 80 km for the atmosphere and 1.0 degrees for the sea. These are part of the High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) and are designed to improve the accuracy of climate simulations by using higher resolutions. The high resolution enhances the representation of certain climate phenomena like the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, although it does not universally reduce biases in all regions [4].\nTraining & Inference: The model was trained on monthly mean data for both climate variables (sla, eke) in each of the three regions (ENA, WNA, BOB) for the duration from 1993-02 to 2013-12. The range of years for evaluation spans from 2014-01 to 2023-05. The data was transformed to the range [-1,1] to facilitate training convergence. We fixed T = 1000 for all experiments to align the number of neural network evaluations during sampling with those in prior studies [15, 41, 42]. The variances in the forward process were set to constants that increase linearly from $\\beta_1 = 10^{-4}$ to $\\beta_T = 0.02$. These values were selected to be small in comparison to the data scaled to the range [-1, 1], ensuring that the reverse and forward processes have roughly the same functional form while maintaining the signal-to-noise ratio at $x_t$ as low as possible.\nEvaluation Metrics: We assess model performance using standard downscaling evaluation metrics: root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Additionally, we employed the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) to evaluate the uncertainty inherent in the multiple predictions generated by diffusion models due to sampling from the terminal Gaussian distribution $x_T$. As only the traditional diffusion model in our baseline models produces probabilistic predictions, CRPS was used exclusively for comparison with this model.\nContinuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS):\n$CRPS(F, x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (F(y) - 1{\\{y \\geq x\\}})^2 dy$ (23)\nwhere $1{\\{ \\cdot \\}}$ is the indicator function. CRPS [13] is employed to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic forecasts in our downscaling model. CRPS measures the difference between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the predicted probability distribution F and the CDF of the observed value x. A lower CRPS value indicates a forecast that closely matches the observed outcomes, effectively capturing the uncertainty and variability in the predictions. This metric is beneficial since it provides a comprehensive measure of forecast quality, encompassing both the accuracy and sharpness of the probabilistic predictions."}, {"title": "4.2 Experimental Results", "content": "Quantitative results: Results averaged over the entire test dataset for Sea-level Anomaly (SLA) in the Eastern North America (ENA) region are presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The quantitative evaluation of the Ki-CDPM model demonstrates its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods for sea-level elevation downscaling. Table 3 presents a comprehensive comparison using RMSE, MAE, and PCC metrics across three regions: Eastern North America (ENA), Western North America (WNA), and the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Ki-CDPM consistently achieves the lowest RMSE and MAE values and the highest PCC values among all methods, indicating its ability to generate accurate and spatially consistent downscaled data. The lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracy in predicting sea-level elevation. In contrast, the elevated PCC value further suggests that the predicted elevations closely align with the patterns and trends observed in the ground truth data, highlighting the model's ability to accurately capture the spatial variability and gradients inherent in sea-level elevations.\nSpecifically, in the ENA region, Ki-CDPM obtains an RMSE of 1.1, MAE of 0.8, and PCC of 0.94, outperforming the best-performing baseline, the diffusion-based downscaling method, which yields an RMSE of 2.5, MAE of 1.9, and PCC of 0.91. Similar trends are observed in the WNA and BoB regions, where Ki-CDPM maintains its superiority across all metrics. Table 4 compares the performance of Ki-CDPM with the diffusion-based downscaling method using the CRPS metric, which assesses the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic predictions. Ki-CDPM achieves lower CRPS values in all three regions (0.09 for ENA, 0.22 for WNA, and 0.31 for BoB) compared to the diffusion-based method (0.13 for ENA, 0.31 for WNA, and 0.37 for BoB), further confirming its ability to provide more accurate and reliable probabilistic downscaled data.\nAdditionally, an ablation study presented in Table 5 highlights the impact of the variogram regularizer in Ki-CDPM. The inclusion of the regularizer leads to improved performance across all metrics in the ENA region, with an RMSE of 1.1, MAE of 0.8, PCC of 0.94, and CRPS of 0.09, compared to the model without the regularizer (RMSE of 1.3, MAE of 1.0, PCC of 0.92, and CRPS of 0.11). These results underscore the importance of the variogram-based regularizer in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the Ki-CDPM model for sea-level elevation downscaling.\nIn addition to downscaling sea-level elevation, the Ki-CDPM model demonstrates superior performance in downscaling other climate variables, such as eddy kinetic energy (EKE), as shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. Ki-CDPM achieves the lowest RMSE, MAE, and CRPS values and the highest PCC values compared to baseline methods across Eastern North America (ENA), Western North America (WNA), and Bay of Bengal (BoB) regions. Specifically, in the ENA region, Ki-CDPM with variogram regularizer achieves an RMSE of 194.83, MAE of 158.62, PCC of 0.95, and CRPS of 0.08, significantly outperforming the model without the regularizer. These results highlight the versatility and robustness of Ki-CDPM in accurately downscaling diverse climate variables."}, {"title": "5 Related Work", "content": "Spatial variability [9] is a significant characteristic of all geographic phenomena, such as climate zones, USDA plant hardiness zones [47], and different terrestrial habitats like forests, grasslands, wetlands, and deserts. This variability influences the flora and fauna within different regions. Additionally, variations in laws, policies, and cultural norms are evident across and within nations. Often referred to as geography's second law, spatial variability is utilized in analytical models like geographically weighted regression (GWR) [29] to measure the interactions between variables in a given area. The challenge of quantifying spatial variability stems from many geophysical elements affecting it. Soil scientists, for example, study soil attributes such as carbon content to evaluate agricultural yield and have noted considerable variation in soil samples within a mere 100 m\u00b2 due to aspects like tillage, soil makeup, vegetation, land management, and topography. Anomaly detection [1] has been widely studied in spatial data mining (e.g., trajectory gaps [37-39]). However, only a limited number of statistical [7] and machine learning methods have addressed anomaly detection in climate science.\nTraditional machine learning models [30], primarily designed for image processing, encounter several obstacles, including the absence of physical constraints, difficulties with managing high-dimensional climate data, and their inability to yield probabilistic outputs in climate data. For instance, Autoregressive models (ARs) [36, 48] are capable of model log-likelihood and complex distributions, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [20, 33] provide rapid sampling capabilities, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [8] favored for tasks like class-conditional image generation etc. Climate downscaling [12, 19, 25, 26] is widely used to facilitate understanding and planning for climate impacts at regional or local levels, with machine learning models also applied in statistical downscaling [22]. Recently, diffusion models have gained interest in climate science due to their capacity to model non-linear relationships, although they struggle with generalization, maintaining physical consistency, and non-stationarity. For example, [51, 53] overlook spatial dependencies, leading to inaccurate depictions of physical processes like ocean currents, wind patterns, and temperature gradients. This work introduces Ki-CPDM, incorporating geostatistical capabilities with a Conditional Diffusion Model to effectively capture spatial variability in climate model variables such as sea level rise.\nDomain Background: The SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) [43] satellite mission offers significant advancements over the TOPEX/Poseidon mission in measuring sea level and surface water elevation. While TOPEX provided accurate ocean surface topography data, SWOT extends this capability to measure ocean and freshwater bodies with unprecedented detail. SWOT's higher-resolution measurements enable precise monitoring of smaller-scale ocean phenomena and inland water bodies, which is crucial for understanding climate change impacts. Its innovative Ka-band Radar Interferometer delivers finer spatial resolution, enhancing our ability to track water storage and movement changes.

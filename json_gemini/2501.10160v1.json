Action plans that consolidate existing digital transformation programs are being reviewed to establish core infrastructure and foundations for sustainable healthcare solutions. Reforming health and social care to personalize home care, for example, can help avoid treatment in overcrowded acute hospital settings and improve the experiences and outcomes for both healthcare professionals and service users. In this information-intensive domain, addressing the interoperability challenge through standards-based roadmaps is crucial for enabling effective connections between health and social care services. This approach facilitates safe and trustworthy data workflows between different healthcare system providers.\nIn this paper, we present a methodology for extracting, transforming, and loading data through a semi-automated process using a Common Semantic Standardized Data Model (CSSDM) to create personalized healthcare knowledge graph (KG). The CSSDM is grounded in the formal ontology of ISO 13940 ContSys and incorporates FHIR-based specifications to support structural attributes for generating KGs. We propose that the CSSDM facilitates data harmonization and linking, offering an alternative approach to interoperability. This approach promotes a novel form of collaboration between companies developing health information systems and cloud-enabled health services. Consequently, it provides multiple stakeholders with access to high-quality data and information sharing.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The global crisis caused by the ongoing pandemic has significantly altered the functionality of various service-based industries, with health and social care being among the most affected. In response, national health and social care programs are advancing action plans to integrate digital solutions as a foundational element in the future planning of health and social care systems by 2025 National Health Service (NHS). With the rise of digital platforms, there's growing demand for technology-driven, home-based solutions in health and social care. This trend includes smart technology, remote health monitoring, and information sharing with professionals. Effective care plan management requires more than just hospital summaries and Electronic Health Records (EHRs), reflecting the need for integrated digital solutions. It also necessitates considering individual user needs and social settings, such as living conditions, personal history, and the flow of healthcare information from one setting (e.g., primary care) to another (e.g., home care).\nFrom a technology perspective, urgent requirements include a patient-centric approach, defined access and control mechanisms, healthcare data models, and integrated reference architecture models and frameworks. These elements are reported as essential for progressing action plans for scalable digital solutions to support health and social care. This emphasis on digital integration is highlighted, for instance, 21st Century Cures Act: Interoperability, Information Blocking, and the ONC Health IT by the USA government's Office of the National Coordinator (ONC).\nFrom a standards perspective in Europe, the European Commission prioritizes healthcare interoperability, cross-border treatment, and the involvement of societal stakeholders in the development of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Standards such as ISO 23903:2021-Health Informatics-Interoperability and Integration Reference Architecture-Model and Framework emphasize creating ecosystems that offer a harmonized representation to achieve interoperability. These systems are designed to be flexible, scalable, and capable of following a systems-oriented, architecture-centric, ontology-based, and policy-driven approach.\nGlobally, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13940/DIS\u2013System of Concepts to Support Continuity of Care [1] provides a conceptual framework to address patient needs throughout their care journey. Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) offers detailed"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "Socio-technical theories like Actor-Network Theory (ANT) help understand interactions within healthcare networks [3], while the quadruple helix model [4] fosters collaboration among university, industry, government, and public sectors. Ontology-based information models capture complex relations in formal language [5], integrating schemas by applying ontological principles to represent knowledge and interactions within healthcare systems. For instance, relationships such as professional roles (e.g., doctor, patient, nurse), spatial relations (e.g., located-in, address), applied technologies (e.g., mHealth apps, telemedicine), and qualitative performance (e.g., quality of service, drug performance) can be managed using a web ontology language (OWL) model. In a complex healthcare system, both social and non-social relations\u2014such as spatial relations, organizational structures, and system interactions are crucial. Combining ontological principles with social principles can enhance understanding and lead to a more robust socio-technical system (STS) model.\nThe ontological analysis of complex healthcare networks using ANT on health facilities has been described in a recent study by Iyamu and Mgudlwa [6]. Additionally, a study by the eHealth Research Group from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland highlights the role of ANT in understanding the implementation of information technology developments in healthcare [7]. Although primarily theoretical, this study provided various approaches for dealing with healthcare networks from an ANT perspective.\nFor instance, the Yosemite Project suggested using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to achieve semantic interoperability of all structured healthcare information. However, this study overlooked human involvement in the design process and did not integrate other healthcare schema standards, such as the ISO:13940 System of Concepts to support continuity of care (ContSys). ContSys is essential for connecting different healthcare settings, offering an overarching conceptual model that includes professional healthcare activities, self-care, care by third parties (e.g., family members, personal care assistants, homecare service providers), and all aspects of social care over an individual's life course.\nThese existing standards, however, do not align with W3C semantic web technologies and linked data [8], which are crucial for creating and maintaining a globally interconnected graph of data. More recently, a paper by Shang et al. (2021) [2] emphasized using knowledge graphs to connect various nonclinical data with electronic health records (EHR) for better decision-making. Knowledge graphs represent knowledge and data entities in a formal ontological structure, making healthcare concepts explicit.\nThe recently completed H2020 InteropEHRate project also demonstrates an interoperability infrastructure using technologies for health data exchange centered on the citizen. However, this project did not implement or align with specific ISO standards, potentially limiting its reusability on an international scale. As part of developing a standards-based roadmap to guide our research, we critiqued several standards to inform our decision-making and development plan. For example, we reviewed Health Informatics-Guidelines for Implementation of HL7/FHIR based on ISO 13940 and 13606. However, we noted that neither of these resources has, to date, modified the existing ISO 13940 model nor included any semantic formalism in their initial work. Earlier work we completed, which offered a formal ontology for continuity of care using DOLCE as a top-level ontology and OWL as a formal language, is cited for background reading [9].\nKey challenges include the limited involvement of healthcare professionals in designing healthcare information models [10], leading to ICT-driven rather than domain-driven approaches. This results in non-standardized data models that"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "We initiate our proposed methodology with two key assumptions. The first assumption is to avoid creating a new ontology or drafting a new standard. Instead, we aim to utilize existing standards to address the healthcare system issues highlighted in the introduction section. The second assumption is reusability. Our rationale for this choice the following considerations RDF/XML was the first RDF format created by W3C and is thus regarded as the standard format. Consequently, most RDF libraries and triplestores output RDF in this format by default. If you want to work with legacy RDF systems or use XML libraries to manipulate your data (since RDF/XML is valid XML), then RDF/XML is the most practical format to use.\nOur methodology is based on ISO/TS 22272:2021-Health Informatics - Methodology for analysis of business and information needs of health enterprises to support standards-based architectures.\nThe project's main objective is to create a Common Semantic Standardized Data Model (CSSDM) that can connect old legacy systems using semi-automated mapping and includes an OWL data model to link with all existing Open Linked Data, thereby facilitating and running secondary data analysis. Figure 3, we illustrate the process of mapping data to the CSSDM ontological schema to generate the final ontology-based knowledge graph model. The upper part of the figure, represented in the dark blue box, shows the classes or entity types associated with the ontological schema. The bottom part of the figure displays all the terms in a table format, which we gathered during the processes associated with Extract, transform, and load (ETL). The arrow in the figure represents the direct mapping between data and concepts. This semi-automated process, using the KARMA tool [13] [14], requires supervision by a human expert to ensure accuracy.\nWe have analyzed and incorporated viewpoints from ISO ISO 23903:2021 \u2014Interoperability and Integration Reference Architecture, and an inference model for future use in modeling a patient-centric perspective [10]. This groundwork aims to achieve the target state outlined in ISO/TS 22272:2021. The overall process of creating the CSSDM is illustrated in Figure 1.\nIn Step 1, we created a Formal Ontology for Continuity of Care (CSSDM), details of which are available in our previous work [9], [15], [16]. In this step, we considered and consulted existing resources related to information models relevant to continuity of care. These resources included national EHR, regional EHR models, FHIR resources, and Continuity of Care Records (CCR) models, which were then mapped and translated into the formal OWL model.\nIn Step 2, we presented, discussed, and disseminated information about our formal OWL model to national and international technical committees with which we are engaged. This collaborative effort aimed to agree on and map concepts based on their meanings. For example, we mapped the concept of \"subject of care\" to FHIR:Patient; \u201cobserved condition\" to FHIR: Observation and \"Referral\" to FHIR: ServiceRequest. However, we couldn't find an exact mapping for FHIR:MedicationRequest in the Contsys resource, so we created a subclass of \"request\" instead. The mapping table is provided in the (supplementary document).\nThe expressiveness of our CSSDM ontology model is ALCHQ(D) as per the description logic (DL) scale [17]. We have not exploited the full power of DL-full as supported by the OWL-2 language; rather, we used simple rules to make our model compatible with the GraphDB rule engine and offer quick query execution times.\nFinally, in this section, we provide details on the data structure of the class observation and the property person.gender in the RDF Turtle syntax. The observation class reuses properties defined by FHIR observation resources. This facilitates our model to be interoperable and semantically aligned with other EHR models using version FHIR 4.6 specification, which is crucial for cross-border studies on intellectual disability clients in the future.\nThe observation captures measurements and makes simple assertions about a patient, a device, or another subject. The"}, {"title": "IV. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION", "content": "Information on the CSSDM progress is shared with the ISO and CEN Community in phases over two years. For instance, the publication of the formal ontology for continuity of care is accompanied by a supporting blog post on the Contsys Website. For the technical implementation, Figure 1 summarizes CSSDM's intended implementation pipeline, detailing the tools and techniques used in our work so far.\nWe have advanced proposals and funding opportunities for additional data collection. Once ethical approval is obtained, we plan to gather more data from various healthcare sources through our identified service. We expect to achieve this through planned fieldwork, including workshops and surveys, which have proven effective in the preliminary phases of the study.\nAs the project expanded, the development team cleaned the collected data using ontoRefine, a data transformation tool based on OpenRefine integrated into the GraphDB workbench. As the research program grew, larger datasets utilized KARMA for data integration. KARMA, an open-source tool, enabled data integration from various sources such as XML, CSV, text files, and web APIs. Additionally, KARMA generated Relational Databases (RDB) to Resource Description Framework (RDF) Mapping Language (R2RML), facilitating file mapping that could be reused for integrating new or emerging models with new data. Figure 3 depicts the process of converting Irish datasets to RDF data using the CSSDM ontology schema as a common schema. The tool's user interface also helps to check and provide initial mapping by engaging healthcare stakeholders in a loop, thus minimizing disagreement and misalignment. This is a semi-automated process, and we can store the initial mapping file as a R2RML file and reuse it in later processes unless the dataset structure is changed.\nFor our prototype development, we used the free version"}, {"title": "V. EVALUATION OF THE CSSDM MODEL", "content": "This step is highly technical, so the focus of pedagogical instruction at this phase is for domain experts (e.g., healthcare professionals) to supervise and validate the query results produced by data scientists within the healthcare organization. For instance, the main responsibilities of healthcare professionals are to verify and confirm whether the outcomes align with their expectations from the given scenario and their initial thoughts when defining personas.\nFor example, in a healthcare domain project by the study group, we illustrate some query evaluations. We include several SPARQL queries [18] to demonstrate that the knowledge graph model successfully answered essential competency queries (CQ) [19], potentially useful for further research and analysis. This also showcases how our proposed methodology integrates theory, practice, and interdisciplinarity in a pedagogically effective manner. Consistency of the CSSDM ontology is checked by the HermiT reasoner, a Prote\u00b4ge' plugin. It identifies subsumption relations between classes. On the other hand Description Logic (DL) based query revealed that model is logically sound in retrieving information. We also have checked CSSDM ontology using oops ! ontology pitfall scanner and have obtained no pitfall badge."}, {"title": "VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "We define healthcare data interoperability as an ongoing process rather than a one-time task, particularly in the rapidly evolving ICT environment. In this paper, we outline how to take a significant step toward addressing the interoperability challenge by adapting existing models and techniques to fit the Linked Data approach [20], thereby generating an interconnected knowledge graph. Using GraphDB pattern matching, as demonstrated in the following figure 4, helps develop such a graph. Knowledge graphs enable more efficient complex queries compared to typical join operations in relational databases. Figure 5 illustrates the results of CQ1 Select all female patient who visited hospital and prescribe quantity. and CQ2 Select all male patient who visited hospital and prescribe quantity., demonstrating how to use Google Chart functionality within the GraphDB SPARQL query panel. It shows that the prescribed quantity of specific drugs is higher for male patients than for female patients. Additional CQs and their SPARQL structures are provided in the supplementary document available online."}]}

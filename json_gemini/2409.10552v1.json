{"title": "AI Literacy for All: Adjustable Interdisciplinary Socio-technical Curriculum", "authors": ["Sri Yash Tadimalla", "Mary Lou Maher"], "abstract": "This research-to-practice paper presents a curriculum, \"AI Literacy for All,\" to promote an interdisciplinary understanding of AI, its socio-technical implications, and its practical applications for all levels of education. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools such as ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. The non-technical component of AI literacy has often been limited to social and ethical implications, privacy and security issues, or the experience of interacting with AI. In AI Literacy for all, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical as well as non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. This paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for Al education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public. This paper advocates for a shift in Al literacy education to offer a more interdisciplinary socio-technical approach as a pathway to broaden participation in AI. This approach not only broadens students' perspectives but also prepares them to think critically about integrating AI into their future professional and personal lives.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "content": "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has ushered in transformative changes across numerous sectors, bringing new challenges and opportunities. As these technologies become increasingly embedded in everyday life, Al literacy is increasingly essential in today's technology-driven world. According to a report by McKinsey (2020), approximately 70% of businesses will adopt at least one form of AI technology by 2030, highlighting the growing integration of these systems into professional environments [1]. This widespread adoption underscores the need for comprehensive Al literacy that extends beyond technical experts to the general population [2]. AI literacy equips individuals not only with the skills to use AI tools effectively and safely but also with the ability to critically understand AI implications, including recognizing biases and potential ethical issues [3]. Furthermore, Al literacy is vital for workforce readiness in an economy increasingly reliant on AI technologies, ensuring individuals can adapt to new roles and job requirements. An informed public is essential for meaningful participation in debates and decision-making processes regarding AI governance and policy, advocating for AI developments that uphold public interest and ethical standards [4]."}, {"title": "II. BACKGROUND", "content": "The conceptualization of AI literacy is closely connected to the broader concept of digital literacy, which has been recognized as essential for all individuals navigating modern technology-driven environments [6]. Just as digital literacy encompasses skills ranging from basic computer use to complex problem-solving in digital contexts, AI literacy must cover a spectrum from understanding simple AI functions to engaging with Al's broader implications for society. Al's prevalence in various sectors like finance, healthcare, and media underscores its broad utility and potential societal consequences, necessitating a comprehensive understanding and responsible application.\nAI literacy is not just an educational asset but a crucial component of informed citizenship and professional competence in the 21st century. It is important to note that the foundational frameworks for AI literacy were designed before the advent of advanced Gen-AI tools like ChatGPT, which have significantly altered the landscape of AI interaction for the general public [7] [8]. These tools have made AI far more accessible to non-specialists, highlighting a critical gap in current educational paradigms. Al education has traditionally been approached primarily through a technical lens, focusing on the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations of these technologies, and the programming skills required for their implementation [9] [10]. This conventional curriculum has served well in fostering competency among designers and developers and enabling domain-specific upskilling [11]. Enhancing public understanding of basic AI often focuses on the non-technical aspects of AI, including discussions on ethical implications, privacy, and security. This separation of technical vs non-technical AI literacy is insufficient in today's socio-technical environment, where the implications of AI extend far beyond the code and into the fabric of societal norms and individual behaviors [12].\nEffective AI literacy now requires a more holistic approach, one that equally emphasizes the conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies within an interdisciplinary social framework [13]. Recent updates to AI education reflect these changes, emphasizing neural networks, practical AI applications, and the ethical, fairness, and transparency issues surrounding AI. Additionally, there is a concerted effort to enhance Al literacy and critical thinking across all areas of computer science education, linking AI closely with data science and maintaining a balanced view of symbolic and deep learning AI methods. Such a balance is crucial not only for technical competency but also for fostering an informed critical appreciation of the socio-technical dynamics at play.\nThe types of Al literacy vary significantly depending on the target audience. For example, K-12 students are introduced to the basic concepts of AI and its everyday applications, fostering an early awareness that can influence future educational and career choices. Undergraduate programs, particularly in computer science, often focus on deep technical training, preparing the next generation of AI developers and researchers [5]. However, Al literacy for non-CS majors is still nascent, emphasizing the need for a curriculum that integrates AI understanding across disciplines such as humanities, social sciences, and business [14]. For the general public, AI literacy encompasses both career reskilling-vital for those in industries transformed by AI technologies and general education aimed at making informed decisions about AI usage in personal life. This broad approach ensures that AI literacy extends from the classroom into lifelong learning pathways, crucial for adapting to continuous technological advancements.\nA literature review of Al literacy reveals a diverse array of conceptual frameworks and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the understanding and application of artificial intelligence across various educational settings [3] [15] [16]. These AI literacy reviews often provide a comprehensive understanding of how Al literacy is being defined, taught, and assessed, highlighting the evolving nature of this field [17] [18] [19]. AI literacy frameworks often include four key aspects: knowing and understanding AI, using and applying AI, evaluating and creating with AI, and addressing ethical issues related to AI [20] [7] [21]. These frameworks are based on the adaptation of classic literacies and aim to provide a consolidated definition and pedagogical direction for AI literacy education, particularly focusing on ethical concerns and competency development. Some researchers argue for integrating AI literacy into the broader framework of technological literacy, viewing it as a multi-literacy that encompasses technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical understanding [22] [23]. Some studies critically analyzed various components of AI literacy found in the literature and suggest that while technical skills are essential, greater emphasis should be placed on the socio-ethical aspects and the role of humans in AI, reflecting the need for a holistic approach to AI education [22] [24] [25]. Evaluation of AI literacy for university students with diverse backgrounds highlights the potential of such courses to foster a conceptual understanding of AI without requiring prior programming knowledge [26]: future educational initiatives are recommended to consider AI as a fundamental skill within the 21st-century literacy framework, alongside reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital skills. Inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, the competencies for AI literacy should encompass basic cognitive abilities to know and understand AI, as well as advanced skills to use, apply, evaluate, and create AI solutions. Having various types of approaches is crucial for preparing individuals to meet future technological challenges and engage responsibly with AI technologies [].\nAl literacy can be categorized into several types, each focusing on different aspects of understanding and interacting with artificial intelligence technologies. These categorizations can help in tailoring educational programs to diverse audiences, from K-12 students, and professionals in various fields to members of society. Below are some types of AI literacy based on the lens with which researchers talk about AI literacy/education:\nTechnical AI Literacy/Education: This encompasses the foundational skills necessary to understand and develop AI systems, including programming, machine learning algorithms, and data science models. This type of AI literacy is emphasized in computer science education and professional development for AI specialists [20] [23].\nGen-AI Literacy: With the rise of Gen-AI technologies like ChatGPT, Bing, and SORA, etc this literacy type focuses on understanding and interacting with Al systems that can"}, {"title": "III. SOCIO-TECHNICAL AI LITERACY CURRICULUM LEARNING OBJECTIVES", "content": "With the proliferation of Gen-AI applications and the disruption caused by the disproportionate access and usage in learning environments, our curriculum is framed by the following questions that we believe every individual in our society should be competent to address across ages, disciplines, sectors, and demographics: What is AI and how does it work? What are the ethical issues in AI? How should AI be used by individuals? How will AI impact our lives?\nThe methodology for building this curriculum began with a literature review on Al literacy, focusing on identifying existing frameworks that outline key concepts taught by educators across the spectrum of technical and socio-technical approaches in AI literacy and AI education courses across the various types of emerging AI literacies mentioned above [20] [7] [9] [10] [21] [35]. The insights from the literature review (as discussed in the background section) were further supplemented by applying the Delphi method [36] to presentations, observations, and discussions from an NSF-funded workshop \"Increasing Diversity in Lifelong AI Education\" organized and facilitated by the authors [5], and the 2024 AAAI Spring Symposium on \"Increasing Diversity in AI Education and Research\" co-organized by the second co-author [37]. These 3-day workshops on AI education and literacy brought together researchers, policy experts, and educators to respond to the increasing concerns and opportunities raised by recent Al developments, and to discuss directions for lifelong Al education. Our curriculum was then refined based on experiences from teaching this content in various settings, including a 2-credit general education course, 3-credit CS-major undergraduate and graduate courses, and a summer camp for middle and high school students.\nWe present 4 Pillars of AI Literacy, shown in Table I, based on a synthesis of the literature and our experience teaching AI Literacy. We use the taxonomy developed in the CS2023 curriculum to present our curriculum for easier integration into current efforts on curriculum alignment by ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI [9]. These four pillars of socio-technical AI literacy are a foundation for an Al literacy curriculum that can be adapted for learning objectives providing a broad but defined vision for Al literacy efforts similar to the work by Touretzky (2019) for Al education [7]. The 4 pillars of AI Literacy are:\n1) Understanding the scope and technical dimensions of \u0391\u0399.\n2) Learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way."}, {"title": "3) Critically Reviewing the Issues of Ethical and Socially Responsible AI in Learning/Work Environments.", "content": "4) Social and Future Implications of AI.\nThe learning objectives for this interdisciplinary curriculum focus on providing students with a comprehensive understanding of Al's scope, technical dimensions, and ethical implications.

Within the broad categories of K-12, higher education, and the general public, specific subgroups and populations require tailored approaches to AI education. Although AI topics are relevant across all educational levels, the depth and teaching modalities should vary to suit the unique needs of each group.\nThe curriculum presented in this paper is an additional Knowledge Area, as an alternative to the AI Knowledge Area, in the context of the CS2023 curriculum described by ACM/IEEE-CS/AAAI [9]. Tables II, III, IV, and V present the adjustable curriculum tailored to the goals and needs of Al literacy for learners in different educational contexts where the 4 pillars map as Knowledge Units, the learning outcomes as CS/KA core units as referred to in the CS2030 body of knowledge. The number of units for each topic reflects the inclusion and depth of coverage within each Pillar for specific educational contexts. While the curriculum is adjustable in terms of units, hours, and credits, we present this as a foundational AI Literacy curriculum. This is based on our experience teaching the content to non-CS majors, CS major undergraduates and graduates, and high school students under the K-12 category. The asterisk (*) in the tables serves as an indicator of the topics we have previously taught. Discussions in our development methodology inform the suggested units for middle school and the general public.\nIn the K-12 or Elementry-Highschool education, AI education starts with structured modalities, focusing on basic definitions and abstract concepts of AI technology.

Hands-on projects, like robotics or simple neural network simulations, help solidify understanding, followed by reflections on how AI impacts daily life [19]. Critiques at this stage focus on fairness and bias at a fundamental level.\nIn higher education, AI literacy goals differ markedly between CS majors and non-CS majors. CS majors are expected to demonstrate mastery and apply technical components of AI, primarily focusing on Pillars 1 and 2. In contrast, non-CS majors engage more with Pillars 3 and 4, emphasizing the ethical and social implications of AI. At the undergraduate level, students also focus on Academic/Professional Integrity more than those in K-12 or general public programs. Graduate education emphasizes research and specialized applications of AI literacy, with a comprehensive approach to research papers, literature reviews, and community projects, varying by major and discipline. Modalities evolve to include deeper technical readings, complex lab activities, and domain-specific applications. For CS majors, activities might involve advanced programming and AI system problem-solving, while non-CS majors focus on applying AI tools within fields like healthcare or economics. Reflections encourage students to consider the ethical implications and societal impacts of their work.\nFor the adult workforce, the focus shifts towards continuous education and professional development, integrating AI training relevant to specific job roles. Readings are centered on case studies illustrating AI applications in business or industry settings. Workshop-oriented activities, often in online formats, emphasize the practical use of AI tools to optimize workflows or automate tasks. Reflections involve assessing the return on investment of AI integration and considering ethical implications relevant to their sectors [35].\nFor the general public, AI education takes on a more varied approach, including community workshops, public lectures, and online modules designed to cater to diverse groups. Introductory readings provide an overview of AI, highlighting its potential benefits and risks. Interactive sessions using AI in everyday applications, such as virtual assistants or recommendation systems, make the technology relatable. Public critiques focus on understanding AI news articles and debunking common AI myths, fostering critical media literacy. Reflections promote community discussions on the personal and societal impacts of AI, encouraging informed public discourse on AI policy and development.\nAcross all levels, the combination of readings, activities, labs, and reflections is structured to not only impart knowledge but also build a deeper understanding of Al's capabilities and limitations, ethical considerations, and potential societal impact. The progression of these modalities ensures that each educational phase builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity and application according to the learners' age, background, and professional needs. For the general public, the approach is designed for broad engagement and awareness, suitable for varying levels of prior knowledge and interest."}, {"title": "V.
